In fact , I planned my recent 12-day stopover in Hawaii around this trek and spent most of that time exploring the garden isle of Kauai . <p> Kauais Na Pali Coast is one of the most beautiful coastlines in the whole world . Hiking the Kalalau Trail is the best way to immerse yourself in the scenery , but you can also opt to kayak up the coast ( unfortunately not an option in winter , which was when I was there ) or take a scenic helicopter tour . <p> I figured this was probably the most epic first-time helicopter ride I could possibly hope for , so we splurged on a tour with Blue Hawaiian .

This is your one chance to see this glorious coastline . <p> Can you spot the goats ? <p> I 'd been eyeing the Kalalau Trail for YEARS with slight trepidation . Between safety concerns and logistical hassles , its not something you 'd do on a whim and if I 'm honest , its not ideal to do as a solo hiker ( though I did it on my own , so obviously its doable ) . <p> But if you do tackle the 11 mile hike to Kalalau Beach , it is SO worth the effort ( and terror ) .

They really needed a good rinsing after being repeatedly caked in sweat and mud for two straight days .

@@118792649 @7792649/ <h> A 4WD Adventure Around The Blue Mountains <p> Last Sunday , I was instructed to meet at Taylor Square in Sydney at 6:30am to be picked up to go 4WD-ing around the Blue Mountains . <p> That 's literally all I knew about the adventure I was about to embark on . I knew about the Blue Mountains and have been aching to get out there to explore more of that region , but I 'm not sure I really knew what a 4WD adventure there entailed . <p> Spoiler alert : This is 4WD-ing in the Blue Mountains . <p> So armed with close to zero information , I rose before sunrise , made my way into the city , and climbed up into my chariot for the day a sturdy Land Rover . We drove about 2.5 hours northwest- of Sydney towards Lithgow and first pulled off to explore an abandoned train station . <h> Zig Zag Railway <p> The Clarence station is part of the Zig Zag Railway , which has been shut down since the big bush fire of October 2013 .

We 'd pass by small groups of other 4+4 vehicles hanging out in a random clearing , with people packing down their campsite from the previous night . We 'd get overtaken by bikers racing to tackle the next hill or bump in the road . <p> Actually , you know what ? It kinda felt like we were- in a video game , what with the trenches to negotiate , vertical hills to climb up , forks in the road to debate between .

@@118792650 @7792650/ <p> Well in addition to partaking in said ludicrous motions , I also hiked my ass off and accompanied the girls on nearly every walking trail that exists in the national park . Personally , I would have picked the few best hikes and spent the rest of the time on the beach , but I was n't calling the shots on this trip . It worked out well enough anyway because I got to see pretty much everything I 'd wanted to , and then some . <h> About Wilsons Prom <p> First off , let 's get the name straight : This fab place is officially called Wilsons Promontory National Park . Tourists like to call it Wilsons Prom , while locals almost exclusively refer to it as The Prom . ( You know , kind of like how tourists say San Fran , while locals say SF ? ) . If we Americans did n't have that dreadful high school dance of the same name , I 'd totally be on board with calling it The Prom but it just feels weird to me , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prom by Public Transport <p> It took me this long to explore the #1 thing on my Melbourne side trip bucket list because , sadly , getting to Wilsons Prom by public transport is a royal PITA . The only way I know of is to take a VLine bus from Melbourne to Foster , and then pay for a shuttle to/from the park with the Foster YHA ( they require you to stay at their hostel at least one night , though ) . The shuttle should drop you off at Tidal River , which is where the main campground is located . <p> But then if you do n't have a car , it 's pretty difficult to get around the park . Most of the hikes you have to drive to the trailheads and walk in from the car park ; otherwise you 'll be walking miles just to get to the trail , not mention to get back , which is just pointless . That said , I see two possible options if you take the bus to Wilsons Prom and do n't have a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that start near the Tidal River Campground and/or hang out at Squeaky Beach or Norman Beach . These are all quick to reach on foot . <p> Embark on the 2-3 day overnight trek around the southern part of the park , which starts at the Mt . Oberon carpark . There is sometimes a shuttle that runs to the carpark from the campground ( likely during summer ) , otherwise you 'll have to walk about an hour to get to the trailhead . <p> Honestly , those are pretty decent alternatives , so I 'm inclined to say it 's worth going to Wilsons Prom without a car if that 's your only option . Obviously it 'd be much , much better to be able to drive around to thoroughly explore the park . <h> When To Visit Wilsons Prom <p> And lastly , summer at Wilsons Promontory is an absolute madhouse . The campground is perpetually full around the December/January school holidays ( you have to apply for a campsite well in advance by a ballot system ) . Unless you 're cool with sharing peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd aim to visit during shoulder season ( Oct-Nov or Feb-Mar ) . We went in early March and it was wonderful a touch of rain and clouds at times , but very comfortable temperature-wise and people density-wise . <p> Yoga on Squeaky Beach . <h> Hiking Wilsons Prom <h> Overnight Hikes <p> I have n't done any overnight hiking in Wilsons Promontory , so I do n't have any photos to dazzle you or firsthand knowledge to impart . If this ever changes , I 'll be sure to update this section accordingly . From what I 've gathered , this is a hike with a great mix of forest and coast and it 's your best bet to find some peace and quiet in the park , as most people opt to stay at Tidal River Campground and just do day hikes . <p> The popular overnight hiking circuit traverses the southern-most part of the park , beginning at the Mt . Oberon carpark and heading east toward Sealers Cove . From here , it heads south along the coast to Refuge Cove , and around to Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Halfway Hut you can either go straight back to the carpark or take the longer route west to Oberon Bay and Norman Bay , ending up at Tidal River . The latter option probably makes more sense if you 're camping at Tidal River without a car . <p> The circuit is typically done in 2-3 days , and you 'll be bush camping for 2 nights at designated free campsites along the trail . While camping is free , you 'll need to pay for an overnight hiking permit which ends up being about the same as what a Tidal River campsite costs . And of course , you 'll be carrying a pack with your sleeping gear , tent , food , and layers . <h> Day Hikes <p> Below is a photo montage of most of the day walks available at Wilsons Prom . The majority are quick and easy walks unless otherwise specified . <p> Lilly Pully Gully An easy stroll through the rainforest with not much of a view , but some cool trees and plants along the way . You can either hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or continue in a circuit toward Mt . Bishop that also ends at the carpark . If you 're not summiting Mt . Bishop , I 'd recommend going back the same way you came as the second half of the circuit is all uphill and not really worth the added effort . <p> Mt . Oberon About an hour walk uphill on a paved/closed-off road . If you summit for sunset , be sure to bring a torch or headlamp so you can find your way back down in the dark . A MUST-DO . <p> Tidal River Boardwalk A very easy stroll along Tidal River , accessible from the campground . It 's also a gateway to some other walks in the area . <p> Norman Beach The closest beach to the campground . <p> Pillar Point There are a couple boulders near the end where you can sit and enjoy the views . <p> Tidal Overlook Aim to do this walk on a clear day so you can admire the bright blue water at Squeaky Beach from above . You can return to Tidal River from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you great views of Tidal River from above on the way back to the campground . A SHOULD-DO . <p> Squeaky Beach This is THE most talked-about , photographed , hyped , and beloved beach in Wilsons Prom . The sand really does squeak as you walk on it . There are cool orange-stained boulders on the beach , very similar to what you 'll find on Tasmania 's east coast . A MUST-DO . <p> Darby Beach If you want a private beach with virtually zero other visitors , check this one out . It 's not as nice as the other beaches in Wilsons Prom , though . <p> Whisky Bay An absolutely glorious beach with soft , flat sand for days . The boulders on this beach are both picturesque and ideal for sunset spotting . A MUST-DO . <p> Tongue Point This is marked as a long , moderate hike , but we found it easy and still worth doing even on a drizzly day though the views up the coast would have been far more impressive on a clear day . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail it 's worth it ! And again , you 'll find loads of those orange-streaked rocks here . A SHOULD-DO . <p> Big Drift This is the most unique spot in the park , simply because it looks like it belongs somewhere in the Outback . Massive white sand dunes , plunked out of nowhere and fit for your frolicking pleasure . Make sure you note where you entered from , as your tracks will be obliterated by the wind in no time . A MUST-DO . <h> Over to you ! Have you been to Wilsons Prom ? Is it on your Australia or Melbourne to-do list ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of April 2016 Wilsons Promontory National Park is about a 3 hour drive from Melbourne . By public transport , you can take a VLine bus from Melbourne to Foster , stay at the Foster YHA , and have them shuttle you to/from the park ( they charge $30 one way , but try to hook you up with other gusts who are driving into the park ) . <p> An unpowered campsite at Tidal River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as well . You must book far , far ahead to camp in December or January ( peak holiday season ) , likely making use of the ballot system . More info on campsite bookings here . Tidal River is equipped with a cafe and general store , so if you run out of food or need to buy other supplies , you should be covered . <p> There is another campground up near the northern entrance of the park called the Stockyard , where unpowered campsites are $50 . Its further away from the majority of the beaches and walks , so most people opt to stay at Tidal River instead . <p> You 'll need an overnight hiking permit to camp anywhere else in the park , which costs $12.50/night per person . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

Take to the water , of course ! <p> The Chicago waterfront is both scenic and accessible , offering myriad activities and attractions on the water . My trip was MADE by the 3 Bs : bikes , beaches , and boats aka the best things to do on the Chicago waterfront , according to Lindsay . <h> Biking Around Lake Michigan <p> I hired a Divvy Bike one day and immediately hit the waterfront . My first thought ? Lake Michigan is absolutely ENORMOUS . With water as far as the eyes can see , it might as well have been an ocean in my mind . <p> My second thought ? Man , biking around the waterfront is THE PERFECT late afternoon summer activity in Chicago . The Lakefront Trail winds for 18.5 miles through parks , beaches , tennis courts , picnic areas , and museums . Views of the water alternate with jaunts through the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absolutely glorious ! <h> To Divvy or Not to Divvy ? <p> With the temptation to make constant stops , I found the 30-minute ride limit of the Divvy Bike to be too short . There are plenty of stations along the way to swap out your bike and reset your 30 minutes , but you likely would n't notice them unless you consulted a map because many are off the trail . I was constantly checking the time to see how close I was to the 30 minutes being up and was late at least once definitely not ideal when embarking on a long , carefree ride . <p> If I were to bike Chicagos Lakefront Trail again , I 'd look into renting a bike by the hour or day instead . However , for shorter trips around the city Divvy is clutch ! <h> Beaches in Chicago <p> For a city so notorious for its cold winter and , well , windy tendencies , you likely would n't equate Chicago with beaches . But come June , Chicagoans flock to the lakefront for some quality time in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can even play volleyball or rent boats . <p> I thought the coolest thing was being able to walk up the landmark-studded Magnificent Mile and end up right on Oak Street Beach . Its literally city skyline meets sand , something you do n't  see too often . <h> Boat Trip on the Chicago River <p> BlogHouse hooked me and my fellow bloggers up with a ride up the Chicago River with Chicago Electric Boat Company and it was easily one of , if not THE highlight of our time in the city . Captaining our own boats , we explored the Chicago River at a leisurely pace taking in the glowing buildings up close and passing by bridge after bridge . And you KNOW how I feel about bridges ! <p> Chicago E-Boats is great for groups that want to charter their own boat and have the freedom to roam around wherever they please , but for smaller parties and those who want to learn a bit about the buildings they 're passing by , one of Chicagos famed architecture boat tours might be a better option . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike , beach , or boat ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Beautiful Lindsay . I too loved the waterfront during the visit to Chicago ! I also agree that the Divvy time limit was not so fun and I always had to find a way to quickly return the bike to make sure I did n't  get charged . 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Thanks , Chanel ! We were so lucky with the weather there , too . And agreed I 've run into the time limit problem in different cities now . These commuter bikes are best when you want to get from A to B , no funny business . Does n't  really jive w/ my frolicking style , ya know ? <p> To Divvy or not to Divvy.SO GLAD you raised this question . My mom and I took Divvy bikes along the lakefront , and while the actual lakefront ride was a real highlight of the trip , the initial process of getting the bikes made me want to tear my hair out ( several of the stations were broken , there were no slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we needed two credit cards , etc . ) Then , once on the lakefront , we were constantly consulting an iphone to find the next return station . If we did it again , we 'd for sure rent all-day bikes from somewhere ! That said , I think its a great service for locals who need it more for short commutes. 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> OMG YES ! ! There were multiple stations that would n't accept my card and it was a royal pain having to look up a nearby station on my phone and then hop over there and try it again . No idea why that kept happening . I actually did n't  have the full station issue in Chicago , but did when I used the commuter bike in DC earlier this year .

@@118792652 @7792652/ <h> Tea House Trekking In Nepal <p> First things first : no one camps while trekking in Nepal . That 's because all of the trails are populated with affordable guesthouses aka tea houses so there 's really no need to . <p> When I set off on the Everest Base Camp trek , I 'd assumed that Nepalese tea houses were simply lodges set along the way where you 'd grab a meal and crash for the night . But they are much more than that tea houses are an institution in the world of Nepal trekking . Each one has its own character ( and cast of characters ! ) . here 's the nitty gritty on tea house trekking in Nepal : <h> Tea at Tea Houses <p> True to name , Nepalese tea houses serve tea with breakfast , lunch , and dinner . They serve it AFTER breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Basically , Nepali people drink tea around the clock . Milk tea is the drink of choice , but they also offer black , mint , ginger , and lemon tea . Coffee is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RS below Lukla , and 50-80 RS above Lukla . <p> Many trekkers will also stop at tea houses along the way to take a break from trekking , rehydrate and warm up with a cup of tea and perhaps a snack , and then carry on their way . <p> For lunch/dinner , the meal of choice is daal baht : a huge plate of white rice with small sides of a vegetable or two ( often spinach and potato ) , and a bowl of lentil soup . Each daal baht is different some curried , some spicy , some plain , some thicker it depends on how the chef likes to prepare it . So although its the same general dish , you should n't get too sick of having it daily since the flavor will vary . The best thing about daal baht is that its All You Can Eat theyll replenish your plate before you have a chance to finish the first serving . Its perfect after a long day of trekking when you 're famished . <p> If you 're craving something other than daal baht , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . Usually they look something like this : <p> Note that meat is hard to come by while trekking in Nepal . On the EBC Trek , there is no meat beyond Namche Bazaar . Below Lukla , there is no meat during the off season ( which is the majority of the year ) . <h> Accommodation At Tea Houses <p> Given that you 're trekking through the wilderness in a third world country , accommodation at Nepalese tea houses is very basic . There is usually no electricity til after dark and no heat outside of winter . <h> Rooms : <p> Most rooms have two twin beds , occasionally a double bed . Some tea houses have dorms as well . Beds are prepped with sheets and a pillow be sure to ask for a blanket ( or 3 ) too , as it is freezing at night ! The room may have a shelf , coat hooks , a chair , or a small table , but often they do n't  . You are usually provided with a padlock to secure your door , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . <h> Common Area : <p> Tea houses have an open room with tables arranged around the perimeter for trekkers to sit , hang out , and dine . In the center of the room there is usually a wood stove , only used in winter months . Its common for there to be a display of snacks and other essential items on one side of the room to entice trekkers to buy . If you 're lucky , there will be a TV . <h> Kitchen : <p> A tea house kitchen will either be connected to the common area , or a completely separate entity . Depending on the tea house owners , visitors may be allowed to hang out in the kitchen and warm up by the fire . <p> The kitchen is stacked with all sorts of utensils , always immaculately arranged and in plain sight : e.g. bowls/plates/cups stacked on shelves , spoons/ladles of varying sizes hanging on the wall , pots/pans arranged by size on top of a cabinet . <h> Toilet : <p> Flush toilets are a rarity in Nepal if they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl before flushing and discard of toilet paper in a waste bin . <p> Most of the time , you 'll be squatting over a porcelain hole and rinsing it down with water afterward . Toilets are frequently located in a separate building , which is not so fun when you have to go outside in the middle of the night to use them . <p> Occasionally you may encounter a tea house toilet with burlap sacks as a door , and a platform inside that you squat through . This is about as primitive as it gets without going in the bush ! No rinse needed , but definitely do n't  look down at the ground below ! <h> Other Amenities At Tea Houses <p> Cold showers are free ; hot showers ( if available ) will cost 100-300 RS . Above Namche Bazaar , you 'll be using a bucket of water if you want to shower . <p> Battery charging is about 150-300 RS , though some tea houses charge by the hour .

Once you arrive in Nepal , if you 're booking a porter/guide theyll sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional gear if needed . I would n't worry too much about prepping beforehand ! <p> MAH <p> Thanks , this info is quite useful .

Check my other posts on it for more details : ) You should n't need to book the tea houses , there are plenty in each village that you can just walk into . I 'm not sure of the price because I paid a lump sum and my guide handled all payments , but its really cheap so I would n't worry about it ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792653 @7792653/ <h> Highlights of a Western Australia Roadtrip <p> During my mid-year break at Sydney Uni in 2006 , I traveled for 3+ weeks in Western Australia and the Kimberley . The most economical and safe way for a solo female traveler to take on the rugged backcountry in Australia is to join a tour group , so I threw a few Gs at Western Xposure to take me from Perth to Darwin during the Aussie winter . <p> I far favored the first segment of this trip , the 2 weeks I spent traveling from Perth to Broome in Western Australia . Heading north , we hit sand , water , and gorges , witnessing the most beautiful natural scenery and uniquely-Australian animals in the wild and IT WAS FANTASTIC . <p> True , the Great Barrier Reef and the Outback are unequivocally the Number 1 Stunners in this country , but man Western Australia sure does pack a punch . It combines the best of both worlds : gorgeous beaches and reef contrasted with desert . If you only have time to visit one region in Aussie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for some west coast highlights ! <h> Perth <p> This sunny , cosmopolitan capital of Western Australia is what one would consider a great place to live , but perhaps not the most amazing place to visit ( Read : ITS KIND OF BORING ) . Though there 's not a plethora to see or do here , its still worth chilling out in Perth for a day or two before or after venturing along the coast of WA . <h> Fremantle <p> If you find yourself with extra time in Perth , you can pop down to Fremantle for a day and tour its colonial-era heritage buildings . Most of them were built by convicts to house prisoners in the 1800s ; today you can tour some of them , like the Round House and Fremantle Prison . Even if you 're not a history buff ( case in point , history was my least favorite subject in school ) , you can still enjoy Freo for its well-preserved architecture , thriving arts scene , and cool waterfront . While I was quickly bored in Perth , I LOVED Fremantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pinnacles Desert <p> About a 3 hour drive from Perth is the Pinnacles Desert . Situated within Nambung National Park , you 'll find this area containing sheer amounts of limestone formations jetting up from the sand . Though its unknown exactly how they came to form , they were made from sand that resulted from shells being broken down . Its super fun to wander around , ogling the Pinnacles and pointing out the ones that look like they have faces . You 'll likely only need an hour or two here before jetting off to your next Western Australia destination . <h> Kalbarri National Park <p> I think Kalbarri is a seriously underrated park , and one that I wish I 'd had more time to explore . Kalbarri National Parks main attraction is its gorges , around which you can enjoy many hikes and overlooks like Natures Window and Z-bend . Abseiling and rafting on the Murchison River are other activities on offer here that I 'll definitely try if I ever make a return trip . <p> Just as scenic as the gorges is the Kalbarri coastline . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs at some point during your Kalbarri visit ! <p> The Murchison River <p> Natures Window , Kalbarri National Park <h> Shark Bay Marine Park <p> Shark Bay is home to two places worth a stop : Hamelin Pool and Monkey Mia . <h> Hamelin Pool <p> At Hamelin Pool you can observe two really unique organisms : dugongs ( sea cows ) and stromatolites ( " living fossils " made of algae , formed into weird squiggly rock shapes ) . I saw the latter and they were pretttttttty cool and , fun fact : the only other place in the world they exist is in the Bahamas . <h> Monkey Mia <p> Despite its name , Monkey Mia is an ideal location for spotting bottlenose dolphins . With a little bait , you can get them to swim right to shore and I mean right to shore , literally as shallow as they can possibly go and not get stuck in the sand . Its a surreal experience having dolphins right at your ankles ! <h> Coral Bay <p> As if swimming in near-neon blue water and laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where you go to swim with whale sharks and dive in Ningaloo Reef . I opted only to snorkel ( why God why did n't  I want to hang with some 40-foot-long creatures of the deep ? ) , but while on our snorkel boat we were treated to a humpback whale sighting . It ai n't  the Great Barrier Reef , but Coral Bay is a definite must-do in Western Australia . <h> Cape Range National Park <p> Let 's be honest : no one goes to Western Australia specifically to check out Cape Range National Park . I mean , have you ever even heard of it ? <p> But I was pleasantly surprised at how aesthetically pleasing this coastal park is . We got to check out a handful of the beaches there , including Sandy Bay and Turquoise Bay , which all but slayed me with their bright blue water/bright white sand/vibrant vegetation combo . <p> Possibly even cooler is Yardie Creek , a colorful gorge with water trapped by the beach on one end . You can do a 2-hour walk around the gorge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karijini National Park <p> You know how I waxed all sorts of poetic over The Outback ? Well I 'm about to preach the gospel of Karijini all up on this blog . <p> Karijini is a natural playground that 's the best way I can describe this place . We spent 2 days playing in the gorges and all I could think was , my god how does this even exist ? ! To go from rainbow paletted cliffs down to the slick gray rock and bright blue rock pools inside the gorge , all on one excursion , was incredible . Mind blowing , even . It was slightly terrifying to inch myself along precarious rock ledges and shimmy my way through the narrow crevices of Spiderwalk , but reaching Kermits Pool and waterfall at the end made it worth conquering the fear . <p> Oh and we found a rope swing in one of the gorges . You better believe I had some fun with that ! <p> Hammersley Gorge <p> Knox Gorge <p> Circular Pool <h> 80 Mile Beach <p> 80 Mile Beach goes down in the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a 140-mile stretch of sand on the northwest coast of Australia , but hey who 's counting . Though this beach is nothing spectacular , I 'll always cherish the night I spent tucked into my swag , listening to the waves crashing and the tide going out in the wee hours of the morning , peeking out through my swag flap to watch the sun rise . <h> Cable Beach <p> The last stop before venturing further north into the Kimberley region , Broome is a chilled out town where you can watch planes fly incredibly low to the ground and gear up before continuing either north to Darwin or south to Perth . Sunset camel rides are the thing to do at Cable Beach , though I was perfectly content just frolicking on foot . <h> Which Western Australia spot would you most like to explore ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> This is a great overview , I 'll have to go back through your other Aussie posts . I definitely want to plan a trip but it seems daunting bc there is so much to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporating Aussie posts into my blog I started this thing long after I lived in Sydney , but I 've got thousands of photos and hundreds of ( poorly crafted ) blogger posts I could repurpose here . Workin on it ! <p> You 're right though , Australia is MASSIVE so youve really got to pick your poison .

@@118792654 @7792654/ <h> Bike The Wineries in Queenstown <p> 10 years ago , I toured New Zealand for a month , turned 21 on Fox Glacier , and had one of the most awe-inspiring trips of my life before kicking off my year studying abroad in Sydney . I 'd been itching to get back to NZ for years for so many reasons , the least of which was to replenish my hazy memories of this magical place . <p> Back then , I was a very different person : naive , unadventurous , and not particularly outdoorsy . I barely knew how to work my point-and-shoot camera on auto mode and I was hopeless trying to figure out how to work the gears on my bike . Basically , I felt like I did n't take full advantage of the glorious landscapes and epic outdoor adventures offered in New Zealand the first time around , and I was determined to redeem myself . <p> 10 years of travel , self-development , and exploration later , cycling had catapulted to the top of my New Zealand to-do list . After an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to do it right when I got to Queenstown by booking a self-guided bike tour with Around The Basin . <p> And so I found myself on a bike exploring the gorgeous countryside around Queenstown , enjoying it in a way I could n't while on a tour bus way back when . Here 's a peek at the Full Day Bike The Wineries Self-Guided Tour that I completed . <p> While there are plenty of trails to ride out of Queenstown , it would make for a very long and exhausting day to ride all the way out to the wineries and back . Plus when your main objective is wine tasting , it 's far more sensible to maximize your time out at the wineries and cut down on the commute time . So for the Bike The Wineries half and full day tours , Around The Basin drives both you and your bike to Arrowtown , sets you up with a map so that you can follow the route solo and at your own pace , and then picks you up at Gibbston in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village about a 20 minute drive from Queenstown . Shops with old school facades and homes with white picket fences are scattered all along the main street kind of reminded me of Stars Hollow from my beloved Gilmore Girls ( speaking of which , I 'm overdue to watch it again note to self ! ) . I grabbed a quick coffee at Provisions and then set off on the trail along the Arrow River . <p> I found the first half of the Arrow River Trail to be far less exciting than the second half , which has you crossing swing bridges over rivers and delighting over sweeping mountainous landscapes . The first half is mostly shaded and woodsy , so there 's not much in the way of views . I imagine it would be pretty glorious to ride through during peak fall foliage , though ! <p> Swing bridges are very typical of New Zealand trails and provide a thrilling way to cross over rivers . Because what fun are bridges that do n't perilously wobble with every step you take ? I may have wiled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crossed whoops ! <p> Things crank up a couple notches once the trail hits the mighty Kawarau River . This electric blue river is where one of Queenstown 's most popular bungy jumps goes down ; you can stop off along the trail to watch or even jump yourself . I crossed the Bungy Bridge to the constant tune of shrieks , then carried on to the Gibbston River Trail . <p> Though it involved crossing the main road , backtracking , and cycling uphill , I could n't resist stopping off at Chard Farm Vineyard . I had a feeling it would yield some pretty insane views of the Kawarau River from above , and sure enough it did . With the constant stops to snap photos , it 's no wonder I only made it to one other winery after this one . <p> Chard Farm is a gorgeous winery , with a whitewashed pink exterior and what I 'm officially calling the best Pinot Noir I 've ever had in my life . The tasting fee is waived if you buy a bottle , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Pinot Noir to enjoy later on . Too bad I 'm a pansy and could n't even manage to finish the bottle in 3 days ! <p> The Gibbston River Trail has loads of spots to stop off and enjoy wine and local produce . Your one-stop shop , though , is Gibbston Valley Wines and the adjacent Gibbston Valley Cheese . Be warned , it is VERY easy to sit here for several hours in the sun and gorge yourself on wine and cheese . I should know , I ate this whole plate of cheese myself . <p> At this point , I only had about an hour left before I had to make it to our designated meeting spot for pickup and I 'd only been to one winery ! I reasoned it 'd be silly to leave it at that , so for good measure I squeezed in a stop at Peregrine Wines . I loved the cool architecture and the underground cave feel to the cellar door here . This is one of the few wineries with free tastings . <p> I ca n't believe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought having 7 hours to cover 15km might leave me twiddling my thumbs towards the end , but instead I found myself racing to reach the finish line in time . If you 're considering booking the same Queenstown bike tour , I 'd strongly recommend booking the full day rather than half day tour so you can take your time enjoying the scenery and the wines trust me , you 'll be glad for it ! <p> Cycling around Queenstown was one of the best things I did on my New Zealand trip . I had a complete blast exploring the countryside and tasting some of Otago 's finest wines , and it was oh-so-easy doing it with an Around The Basin bike tour . Highly recommend x 1000 ! <h> Thank you to Around The Basin for hooking me up with a incentives I may receive . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of April 2016 Around The Basin offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and $80 for a half day . Note that most wineries charge a tasting fee , which is not included in the price of the tour . It 's a 15km ride from Arrowtown to Gibbston , with the full day tour offering an optional 8.7km loop to check out additional wineries . <p> Around The Basin also offers bike transfers and other self-guided and assisted bike tours around Queenstown 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Oh my goodness . This is so up my alley its not even funny ! I 've done a couple of bike &amp; winery tours . However , they were on New Jersey backroads in the states . This trumps that times 1000 ! I 'm saving this to my someday boards on Pinterest , that 's for sure . <p> Bahaha , I did n't  know you could cycle to wineries in NJ ! ( Actually , did n't  even know there were wineries in NJ ! ) . This is one of my new favorite activities , I think I 'd love to do more of these winery bike tours around the world !

@@118792656 @7792656/ <h> Two Fantastic Day Hikes on the Amalfi Coast <p> Nows about the time I pat myself on the back for having my trusty analog journal to keep diligent track of my every move and thought during my 5 weeks traveling solo in Italy in May/June 2007 . Thanks to this journal , I 'm able to relive my adventures and rewrite them in blog form ! ( slowwwwly but surely ) <p> I 'm happy to report that my travel writing has drastically improved since then , while my feistiness and rationality have remained in tact . I mean did I really write this ? : <p> I 'm at a place called Da Meme and just had a 4-cheese pizza ( woo lard ) . Heres what gets me why do some places refuse to give me a bread basket EVEN THOUGH theyll charge me for coperto y pane on the bill ? Is it because I 'm dining solo ? That I only ordered a pizza ? That I 'm a dumb American female tourist who supposedly does n't  know better ? I almost want to inquire , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My days on the Amalfi coast were punctuated by hill treks , bookended by croissant breakfasts and pizza dinners ( apparently sans bread ) . My carboloading was completely necessary , since I was tackling two half-day hikes and , you know , needed that energy . <p> Amalfi and Positano are the two main towns on the coast , the latter being more touristy and expensive . I was based in Atrani , a village very close to Amalfi that I found far less crowded , yet conveniently located . Being in or near Amalfi is ideal for taking on the two hikes I did : Valle delle Ferriere and Sentiero degli Dei . <h> Valle delle Ferriere <h> Amalfi to Pontone ( 3-4 hours , easy ) <p> Note : The start and end of this walk are n't entirely obvious or at least they were n't in 2007 . I recall not knowing how far back to go to reach the trailhead and thinking I had passed it , then not being able to tell at the end which random little side street downhill led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adventure , I say ! <p> To start this walk , head inland up the main street in Amalfi . Past all the shops , you 'll soon find a steep set of stairs that you 'll take up into the hills . This is the least fun and most exhausting past of the walk , but once the ascent is over the rest of it is a breeze . Straight off the stairs you 'll reach the small village of Pogerola , a fantastic place to reward yourself with a snack or drink with a view . <p> The trail continues inland along the mountains , weaving in and out of woods , past streams and the occasional waterfall , and constantly opening up to sweeping views of the valley and coast . My only companions were the occasional flocks of goats passing by , goatherd in tow . Glorious ! <p> The second half of the walk leads away from Amalfi toward Ravello and Scala , through villages with homes nestled amidst terraced gardens and lemon groves , and views of the Mediterranean TO DIE FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived , whatever ) here forever and ever amen , that 's how stunning this part of the Amalfi coast is . <h> Sentiero degli Dei ( Path of the Gods ) <h> Praiano/Bomerano to Positano ( 4-5 hours , moderate ) <p> Note : The start of the walk in Praiano is very tricky to find , and the long initial hike uphill is no joke , so be sure to bring a map and plenty of water ! I did not . Alternatively , you could start the hike at a higher elevation , if you can find a way to get to Bomerano ( by public transport , it requires 2 buses ) . <p> To get to the trail , you can take the train from Amalfi to Praiano . If you heed my advice above and bring detailed directions and/or a map , it wo n't take you 45 minutes of fumbling around in town to find the starting point like it did for me . The trail begins just above the Convent of St Domenico . <p> As in the Valle delle Ferriere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek from Praiano except here , you have 1000+ steps to climb . Yeah , like I said no joke . I felt like I 'd inadvertently signed up for boot camp on my holiday as I sweat through my clothes ten times over . <p> But then you turn a corner and catch your first glimpse of Positano , and suddenly you forget the hell you just went through to get to this point . And you KNOW you 'd do it again if it meant you could take in this view one more time : <p> Sentiero degli Dei is less wooded than Valle delle Ferriere , providing constant views of the coast as you inch closer to Positano . I was n't mad about it . <p> As I approached the village of Nocelle I was intent on grabbing lunch and letting my legs recover ( or more like letting my sweat dry ) , but would you believe that I somehow ended up leaving town via 1700 stairs down to Positano instead ? Winging it and consequently getting hopelessly lost proved to be a running theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , I still have the same style of traveling , albeit with a slightly better sense of direction . <p> So about those 1700 steps downhill . You 'd think it 'd be a breeze , but steep declines are often more uncomfortable than steep ascents . I could push my screaming thighs uphill , but there was n't much I could do to remedy my shaky knees going downhill . <p> Ohmygod , I 'm 22 years old here ! <h> Which hike should you do ? <p> If you can only do one , I 'd recommend Valle delle Ferriere . It 's easier to get to/from , easier to walk , is less trafficked and has more varied scenery . Sentiero degli Dei is more demanding , but it carries more bragging rights and the views are more dramatic . <p> No matter what you decide to do , be sure to get out and enjoy the Amalfi coast from every which vantage point ! You could do worse than those yielded by these two hikes . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792657 @7792657/ <h> Biking Tulum : 3 Rad Excursions Without A Rental Car <p> I 'm a bit weird when it comes to renting a car on my travels . On one hand , there 's nothing ( literally nothing ) that makes me happier than a good road trip ; but on the other , I almost never rent a car when I 'm traveling solo because its flippin expensive . More importantly : I 've been spending most of my time in countries that drive on the left side of the road and do n't  yet feel comfortable operating a vehicle where everything is switched around inside . <p> But Mexico well , Mexicos a horse of a different color . They drive on the right , - and if you book your rental car far in enough in advance itll cost you just a few dollars a day- ( seriously ) . However , - multiple sources told me that police bribes are rampant and that its all too common to get pulled over and fined for no reason . <p> I do n't  scare easily so ordinarily that would n't have deterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but for some reason , it just did n't  reel right . That , and I realized that most of the things I wanted to see and do could be easily reached on bike no motor needed . <p> And so this blog post idea was born ! <p> Biking is hugely popular in Tulum , primarily because it makes getting around town and going between town and the beach a whole lot easier. - If you- travel to Tulum , you can rent a bike and use it to- reach some really cool spots nearby : for example , the beaches , the ruins , and a few cenotes are all within a few miles of the town center . <p> Ive mapped out three different routes you can take , all of which make for the perfect morning excursion . And yes , this night owl did say- morning because a lot of these spots get crazy-crowded by mid-to-late morning , and because the heat is a little more bearable early in the day . So get your ass out of bed early , hit those pedals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note : When I refer to " main intersection " , I mean where these 3 paths meet . <h> Where To Rent A Bike In Tulum <p> Many hotels and hostels in Tulum offer bikes to their guests , but if yours does n't fear not . Here are a few places that rent out bikes in Tulum : <p> Kelly Bike on the NW corner of the main intersection in town , 100 MXP ( US$5 ) /day , open 9am-8pm <h> Where To Bike In Tulum <h> 1 . Tulum Ruins <p> The Tulum Ruins are a quick bike ride 1.7 miles from town , mostly on a bike path that 's separate from traffic . Unless your idea of fun times is shuffling through a tourist site with hoards of other visitors ( namely tour groups ) , be sure to arrive around 8am when it opens . Admission is 70 MXP ( US$3.80 ) . <p> The ruins are fascinating to explore , but beaches are my bae ( Whoa , did I really just use that term ? Did I use it correctly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I pretty much rushed through the ruins to get to the beach that you see in all those photos of Tulum . <p> The conditions werent quite right for the photo I had in mind , but oh well . <p> There 's another beach just south of this viewpoint that 's ace for a quick swim or sunbathing session , but it was absolutely swarming by 9am when I was there . <p> Not pictured : the main part of the beach with ALL THE PEOPLE . <h> 2 . Tulum Beaches <p> There is a colectivo ( shared taxi van ) that runs between Tulum town and the beaches approximately every hour , but they are mostly meant for locals who rely on them for transport to work at the resorts and are often full . Thus , if you 're staying in town rather than in the beach area , the best way to get to the beaches in Tulum is by bike . <p> From town , there 's a bike path that runs all the way down Avenida Coba . It 's about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 307 ) to the end of Av . Coba , at which point you can turn left or right . You 'll find plenty of tempting beachfront either way , but the right side has more options and is more commercialized . <p> Head left , and eventually you 'll reach the Tulum Ruins . You do n't have to go that far to find some good beaches though . One of the first spots to pull off is near the national park entrance you ca n't miss it with all of the parked bikes there . <p> Further down the road ( towards the ruins ) , there are other places to park and walk in to the beach . Though you can barely walk a stretch of sand that is n't lined with resort property , it does n't feel super touristy or overcrowded anywhere along the beach . Highly recommend hitting the Tulum beaches in the morning , though , if you 're anything like me and prefer to soak up glorious landscapes with as few people around as possible . <p> If you head to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike path continues for some time before you have to ride in the street with vehicular traffic . There are loads of restaurants , bars , and shops down this end . I struggled to find any entrance to the beaches down this way that were n't through the resorts , so you may have to sneak through or pony up and buy a drink at the resort bar if you want to hang on their beachfront. <h> 3 . Cenotes Near Tulum <p> Did you know that there are a few cenotes close enough to Tulum that you do n't need to rent a car or take a tour to get to ? You can DIY it by renting a bicycle and riding down Av . Coba ( Rte 109 ) in the opposite direction from the beach . I 'd also recommend renting some snorkel gear to use in the cenotes and taking it with you , as rentals are pricier if you wait til you get to them . <p> Starting from the main intersection in town ( Av . Coba and Highway 307 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cenotes in the order in which you 'll pass them , but based on my experience I 'd advise hitting Gran Cenote first as it 's extremely popular and tends to get crowded shortly after opening . If you 're up for all of these cenotes ( and a 10 mile bike trip , roundtrip ) , continue on to Zacil-Ha and Carwash , and then hit Calavera on your way back into town . <p> Cenote Calavera About a mile from the main intersection , you 'll hit Cenote Calavera . This one is small and tends to be more popular for diving rather than swimming/snorkelling , but it 's just too darn cool to miss . <p> Cenote Calavera is essentially a big hole in the ground that you can climb down a ladder to get into . Or if you 're diving , you just jump right in off the edge . I would n't say it 's the best snorkeling spot , but definitely drop inside it 's super peaceful down there . <p> I 'm not too sure what time it opens , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 100 MXP ( US$5 ) . <p> Gran Cenote About 2.3 miles from the main intersection ( and 1.3 miles beyond Cenote Calavera ) , you 'll find Gran Cenote : one of the most popular cenotes around Tulum . For this reason , I highly urge you to get there as soon as it opens at 8am . I had it all to myself for all of 5 minutes when I did this , but they were 5 exceptionally magical minutes and well worth the effort of waking up early . <p> Gran Cenote has a couple of caves you can swim into , and crystal-clear water in which you may be able to spot some little turtles . Admission is 150MXP ( US$7.50 ) . <p> Cenote Aktun Ha ( Carwash ) About 4.8 miles from the main intersection ( and 2.5 miles beyond Gran Cenote ) is the cenote known as Carwash , which was at one time used to wash taxis . I did n't make it here , but if you 're up for more cycling in the Mexican heat I hear it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot fish , turtles , submerged trees , and deep caves while snorkeling . <p> Cenote Carwash opens at 9am and admission is 50 MXP ( US$2.70 ) . <p> Cenote Zacil-Ha About 5 miles from the main intersection ( and 2.7 miles beyond Gran Cenote ) is Cenote Zacil-Ha . I do n't know much about it , but it 's so close to Carwash that you may as well do them both in one trip . This cenote opens at 10am and admission is 80 MXP ( US$4.30 ) . <h> Which biking excursion in Tulum would you rather do ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

We hit Death Valley , Bryce Canyon , Zion Canyon , Monument Valley , the Grand Canyon , and Route 66 . Totally a case of cramming in too much driving and too many sights into a short period of time but , you know , it 's what I wanted at the time , so no regrets .

Its probably best seen canyoning from the other side of it . I 'd seen such stunning pictures of The Subway ( thank you , flickr ) and had it in my mind that I just HAD to see it for myself . I mean , look at that blue pool ! <p> Believe you me , I did my research beforehand . I knew we had to reserve a special permit because they only allow 20 visitors a day on the trail . I also knew that it would be a good idea to rent water shoes with special grips on the bottoms because we 'd be walking on very slippery rock in some parts . <p> Armed with permits and special shoes , we set off on the trail to The Subway . When I do a serious hike , I expect to be rewarded with beautiful scenery , otherwise its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not particularly scenic ; rather than enjoying the picturesque views of the canyon from above , we were mostly walking through bush and the river bed . I was n't thrilled about it . <p> The hike itself is not super strenuous , but in the desert heat it 's a doozy . Clearly this was back in my amateur days , because I had n't thought to pack more than a tiny Poland Spring water bottle to last me the entire day ( strike 3 ) . Needless to say , I downed it in under an hour . <p> After about 3 hours , we reached what looked to be the end of the trail as it merged with the river . I gingerly crept across slick rock and continued walking upstream toward the finish line . Upon approaching the canyon wall , I surveyed my surroundings . It did n't quite look like the photos I 'd seen , but it bore some resemblance . With no dry rock left to hike on and expensive camera gear on me , I debated carrying on a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured there probably was n't much more to see 50 feet further , turned around , and headed back utterly underwhelmed by what we 'd seen . <p> Later that afternoon , we drove out of Zion and crashed for the night at a motel on the way toward Monument Valley . I still could n't get over the disappointment I felt over the hike to The Subway , so I took to Google to see if I had missed something . Turns out , if I had walked just a bit further on , I would have turned the corner and seen exactly the spot in which all those photos I 'd seen were taken . <p> Can you imagine going all the way to somewhere extremely specific and out of the way , and turning around after getting 99% of the way there ? I unknowingly did this and it is the worst . <p> Well , let 's say second worst after being up all night long vomiting in the motel bathroom , then driving the entire following day with motion sickness that only made it worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never know for sure , but I suspect it had to do with being so dehydrated after a physically demanding day in the sun with little water . <h> What could I have done differently ? <p> I suppose I could have obtained more specific instructions on exactly where to walk , but being an actual hiking trail , you usually expect it to lead you where you 're meant to go , right ? <p> In retrospect , I wish I 'd done the Angel 's Landing trail instead ( or in addition ) . It 's the quintessential Zion hike and I totally missed out on it ! <p> The only REAL mistake I made , though , was not bothering to bring an adequate supply of water for the hike . That was just foolish on my part . I 'm terrible at drinking water on a daily basis anyway , but 5 years later I 'm pleased to report that I 'm now extremely diligent about staying hydrated when I go hiking . <h> What 's the dumbest thing you 've ever done while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2015 The hike to The Subway in Zion National Park is about 6.5 miles return from the Left Fork Trailhead and takes 5-9 hours . Alternatively , you could do the " top-down " , more technical version of the hike which begins on the other end with some rappelling . <p> You 'll need to obtain a backcountry permit in advance of hiking from the National Park Service ( under Canyoneering Day Trips , select Left Fork North Creek ( SUBWAY ) ) . 20 permits are available each day for The Subway hike and it costs US$5 to apply for one . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> The dumbest thing that I have ever done while hiking was wearing TOMS when doing a 6 hour hike up a volcano ( I was really stupid for that one ) . I have yet to visit any national parks in America myself , but those photos of the Subway from Flickr look gorg .

@@118792660 @7792660/ <h> I Got Naked On South Molle Island <p> It took just a few hours of pacing around Airlie Beach before I decided : I have to get out of here . <p> Do n't get me wrong , you could do far worse than a town blessed with an endless summer . Airlie 's just completely dominated by tourism it 's merely a place to crash on either side of your overnight sailing trip . Young backpackers hit up Magnums and Beaches , the infamous bar/hostel/restaurant hybrid establishments on the main strip that tempt with their $15 meal combo deals and nightly drinking games and DJs . Then they return to their hostels super late and make all sorts of drunken racket with no regard for those sleeping in tents nearby ( AHEM , #notbitter ) . <p> When you strip away all the touristy bits , there 's not much left to Airlie Beach . The restaurants leave something to be desired , and I speak authoritatively when I say that there is NO GOOD COFFEE in town . Obviously a dealbreaker for me . <p> Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist office in hopes of them catapulting me somewhere more awesome except this time I was less desperate and actually had an idea in mind : <p> I wanted to go camping on an island , all by myself . Just me , my tent , my gear , and some food . <p> I knew this was doable because I 'd discovered Scamper while doing research for my Whitsundays trip a couple months earlier . They organize transport to campsites on several islands in the Whitsundays , and rent out all the gear you could possibly need for a camping trip . The best part ? They provide you with jugs of water ! I 'd had visions of myself lugging my massive backpack , camera bag , food , and multiple gallons of water around town and to the port . As much of a hoot as that would have been , I was happy to have my water waiting for me when I boarded the island boat . <p> With a quick phone call , the travel agent had me sorted for my Whitsundays camping trip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day ! <p> I was a little wistful for the famous Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island , but I figured I 'd save $90 and camp somewhere closer since I 'd be hitting it on my upcoming Whitsundays sailing trip . By contrast , South Molle is only a 10 minute ( rather than one hour ) boat trip from the marina and close enough to the mainland that I had stellar phone reception . That somehow made me feel a little safer being the ONLY ONE on this island ! Unbeknownst to me when I booked , no one would be joining me at the Sandy Bay campsite during my two days there . <p> So I put up my tent and hammock , and took off my clothes ! <p> You might be thinking , well DUH , of course you get naked whilst on a deserted island . I 'm no prude , but I also do n't have the impulse to shred articles of clothing the second I get home from work ( lookin ' at all you girls who de-bra and de-pants I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans for sweats , but I 'm not wearing any less clothing . What I mean is : I 'm ok with wearing clothes . They do n't really bother me . And it 's definitely not typical of me to , er , get naked outside of the shower or bedroom . <p> But on South Molle , I got island fever and stripped . I was naked for two straight days and it felt pretty dang great . <p> A strategically placed sarong , hat , and sunscreen kept me from getting burnt to a crisp . But I mean , I had skin that had never before seen the sunlight . It 's kind of a miracle that I did n't transform into a ripe tomato . <p> My Whitsunday camping trip was a lovely blend of slothdom and physical overexertion . More often than not , I was sunbathing on the beach or laying in the hammock reading the Mindy Kaling book . Soon I started feeling like a real lazy ass , so I instated a rule where every time I crossed over the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do 10 pushups and 10 squats . I 'm telling you , I 'm the worst at being lazy but you know I care about staying fit while traveling . You can take the girl out of crossfit , but you ca n't take crossfit out of the girl ! <p> One afternoon , I put on some clothes and set off to trek to the other side of the island . I was drenched in sweat within minutes of starting what was a pretty easy uphill climb . Behold the power of the Australian sun ! It feels so nice when you 're laying on the beach enjoying the sea breeze , or are shaded by trees but take away the breeze and the shade and you pretty much want to die . <p> Still , it was totally worth it for the near-360 degree view of the surrounding islands from above . I was entranced by the deep blue giving way to light blue as the sea met the reef just offshore from some of the beaches . The blues contrasted beautifully with the greens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just look at it ! <h> About the South Molle Island walk <p> The walk I did was from Sandy Bay to Spion Kop . I found the first half of it was a thousand times more fantastic than the second half in fact , literally all of the above photos are from it . The second half passes through some rainforest , so if nothing else it provides some shade from the relentless sun . From the Spion Kop lookout you can see several of the nearby islands from a distance , but they all look layered together as one mass of land pretty anticlimactic , in my opinion . If you ever find yourself trekking on South Molle Island , I say save your sweat and only venture halfway down the trail , then turn around and head back to Sandy Bay . Or alternatively , head to Mt . Jeffreys instead of Spion Kop . I did n't do the Mt . Jeffreys segment of the trail , but it 's supposed to culminate in magnificent 360-degree views . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of December 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitsunday island campsites . Return tickets range from $65 AU ( South Molle Island , 10 minutes ) to $155 AU ( Whitsunday Island/Hook Island , 1 hour ) . They also have camping gear available for renting and provide free water on all trips . <p> You must have a valid Whitsundays National Park pass in order to camp on the islands . You can book online for $5.50 AU/night per person , or Scamper can arrange it for you . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Melissa Trinidad <p> I used to be in the de-bra camp but now that I live with 19 other people .

@@118792662 @7792662/ <h> 5 Reasons To Travel Southeast Asia During Off Season <p> Like the travel nerd I am , early on in my 2013 Asia trip planning , I invariably googled things like when to visit Southeast Asia , seasons in Southeast Asia , and Southeast Asia monsoon . Because when it comes down to it , weather can often make or break your travel plans , no matter how much optimism you throw at it . Many of my fondest travel memories happened under clear blue skies on 80-degree days ; most of my travel disappointments had a lot to do with crummy weather . <p> So what 's the weather like in Southeast Asia ? <p> November through February is peak season , when the weather is cooler and drier than the rest of the year . It also happens to coincide with the western winter ; all the more reason for tourists from the other side of the world to plan their trip to Southeast Asia during this time . <p> March through May , for all intents and purposes , is shoulder season in Southeast Asia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures often hovering around 100 degrees . Its also insanely humid , with occasional rain . <p> June through October is generally considered wet season prime time for monsoon rains . Its not uncommon for the daily rain to start a month earlier as it did during my trip . <p> My trip had me gallivanting around Southeast Asia from April through June , smack in the middle of the off season . Not exactly ideal weather conditions , but I had to roll with it . <h> 1 . It 's less crowded <p> As common sense could tell you , any place tends to be less crowded during its off season . This equates to a slew of desirable things such as less time spent waiting at attractions and less hassle overall . More than that , you feel more immersed in the local culture when there are n't  tourists in your line of sight like you 're somehow more a part of life there than just a visitor . <p> Thanks to lower crowds in the off season , I had a few of the temples at Angkor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth traveling Southeast Asia during the off season when its less crowded . <h> 2 . It 's cheaper <p> In an attempt to drum up more business during the off season , many hotels and guesthouses lower their rates sometimes by as much as 50% . For instance , a bungalow at Time For Lime , the guesthouse I stayed at while on one of the Thai islands , goes for 1490 THB during peak season , 1190 THB during shoulder season ( while I was there in April ) , and 690 THB during off season . AND , they have an off season special where if you stay for 3 nights , the 4th night is free . That is an insane amount of money to save just by traveling at a time when not many others do . Significantly cheaper accommodation is an excellent incentive to travel Southeast Asia during off season . <h> 3 . It does n't rain THAT much <p> The wet season is the wet season for a reason : it rains almost daily . And rain is not exactly ideal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starting in May , like clockwork you can expect a mid-to-late afternoon shower that ends almost as soon as it begins , and brings with it some cool air to curb the hot , humid weather . But since the rain is so predictable , its actually very easy to plan around it : I counted on that late-afternoon rain as a break from my daily frolicking . Do n't  let the rain be a deterrent from visiting Southeast Asia during off season . <h> 4 . You do n't need to book ahead for accommodation <p> About a week into my time in Thailand ( early April ) , I realized that there was no point in booking accommodation ahead of time . Guesthouses were rarely , if ever , full and if by chance the one I wanted had no rooms/beds available , there were always plenty of other affordable options nearby . <p> As someone who tends to plan a wee bit too much , it felt rather liberating to roll into town without an exact destination in mind . And besides , how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost trying to find it ? ( answer : an embarrassing number of times ) . This problem is no more when I wing it and pick my accommodation upon arrival . <p> Additionally , not pre-booking accommodation gives you more flexibility in your travel plans . You do n't have to worry about arriving in a new city on a certain day just because you booked a hostel for that date ; instead , you can make decisions on the fly on a whim . On my 2013 Asia trip , a few times I met fellow travelers on the bus or train ride in and we ended up finding a place to stay together ; had I been tied to a booking , I would n't have had the flexibility to do this . It 's worth taking advantage of the Southeast Asian off season for more flexible travel . <h> 5 . Thunderstorms ! <p> If you 're not a fan of thunder and lightning this last one might not be a selling point , but during the off season , there are frequent thunderstorms in Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice added bonus to off season travel . <h> Heading to Southeast Asia ? <p> If this article helped you , I 'd greatly appreciate it if you 'd consider making your Southeast Asia trip purchases through the following affiliate links . Any profits I make through your purchases go directly into covering the ever-increasing cost of running this site at no extra cost to you ! : ) 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Not EVERY day , but I 'd say the majority of the time you get those hazy gray skies with sun and then some heavy rain by mid-afternoon . Its really not that bad though ! <p> ardwinna <p> I would think a cloudy day would be slightly cooler ( not less humid ) . Clouds and not having full-on sun beating down on your is nice , I 'm sure . And the best part is you can plan your afternoon break in a cafe and watch the torrential rains whilst catching up with your social media friends telling them all about your trip . Am I right ? <p> Haha , I like the way you think !

Every damn day . It 's been nice having a comfy bed , a cat , a routine , and a home base for the past year in one of the best cities in the world , but there is a gradually-loudening voice inside reminding me that this is not the life for me . I 'm itching to make some moves , and I think 2015 is going to a big year . Stay tuned , kiddos ! <p> In the meantime , I 'm entertaining my wanderlust by reminiscing over adventures I 've had on the other side of the world , replacing my daily skyscraper views with flashbacks to the glorious scenery I chased last year in Asia . I still ca n't decide which of the most beautiful places in Asia was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches of Thailand , Vietnam , and Cambodia ; or the Indian desert . But here are the final contenders , i.e. the most beautiful place I experienced in each of the 6 Asian countries I explored last year : <h> The Himalayas , Nepal <p> Remember that time I hiked for 3 straight weeks to Everest Base Camp and back ? It was worth all the blisters and frigid nights for the mind-numbingly stunning mountainous scenes that rocked my world on a daily basis . <h> The Limestone Karsts of Thailand <p> I hit up my share of islands during the 6+ weeks I spent in Thailand , but in the end I could n't fight my love for those with the dramatic limestone karsts . They sure do n't make most of em like that elsewhere in the world ! <p> From the oasis of Maya Bay to the climbing mecca of Railay , I spent no less than 95% of my waking hours gaping at the rock-meets-beach scene before me . Can you blame me ? <h> Thar Desert , India <p> Fact : I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3+ weeks I spent there with fuzzy happy memories and beautiful natural scenery , namely because I spent most of my time in the cities of Rajasthan . But I did have a moment while chillaxin ' in the Thar Desert outside of Jaisalmer with a pack of camels . <h> Koh Rong , Cambodia <p> Behold , the happy little accident that ended up being a highlight of my entire 5 months in Asia . Koh Rong is a non-hyped island off the coast of Cambodia , and I selfishly sort of wish it stays underdeveloped and pristine the way it was when I visited . White sand , blue water , a puffy cloud-studded sky what more could a beach lovin ' girl want ? Fish amok and mojitos in the sand , and bioluminescent plankton at night ? Well ok ! <h> Nong Khiaw , Laos <p> I 've still got images of the milk chocolate-colored river and ubiquitous lush green mountains of Nong Khiaw imprinted in my mind . I definitely did n't hate waking up to that view or spending lazy afternoons writing from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I 'd had more than a week there , I 'm certain I 'd have fallen hopelessly in love with Laos ; instead , he 's the one that got away . Just look at this stunner ! <h> Jungle Beach , Vietnam <p> While I may not have thoroughly LOVED my days at Jungle Beach , I did appreciate the magnificent landscape there . Cooling off from the sweltering heat in the warm water , looking back at the palm trees and mountains behind the resort was just the best . <h> Which do you think is the most beautiful place in Asia ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Your photos are stunning .

Do n't  be afraid ( or too lazy ! ) to take pictures from inside your car . <p> One thing to be aware of when roadtripping in Iceland is that there often is n't room to pull over on the Ring Road . Its just not safe to stop your car on the side of the road wherever you please , so do n't  be that guy . <p> But worry not ! If you 're not the one driving and you 've heeded my advice about lugging a telephoto zoom lens on your Iceland trip , you can totally snap some awesome shots from inside the moving car . Here are a couple tips to keep in mind for taking awesome photos on a road trip from the car : <p> Shoot with a fast shutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene around you is moving . Unless you want it all to appear a colorful blur , you 'll want to freeze the motion by setting your shutter speed to 1/400 or faster . <p> Shoot as zoomed in as possible . When you 're shooting through windows and windshields , there 's bound to be dirt and other residue on the surface . The more zoomed in your lens is , the less in focus those surfaces will be . I found the 70-200mm lens to be perfect , especially when zoomed in closer to 200mm . <p> I took this photo straight through the front windshield at f/3.5 , 1/4000 second , ISO 320 , all the way zoomed in at 200mm : <p> I shot this rainbow through an open window at f/8 , 1/400 second , ISO 400 : <h> How To Photograph Waterfalls in Iceland <p> You 'd be remiss not to photograph the waterfalls in Iceland , so let 's assume that you are on a quest to capture these amazing feats of nature . <p> here 's the thing about waterfalls : they make for interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them depends on how you want to capture this motion and you 'll do this primarily by controlling the shutter speed . <p> Here 's a quick and dirty rule of thumb : <p> If you want to freeze the roaring motion of the falls , use a faster shutter speed <p> If you want the falls to appear smooth and blurred , use a slower shutter speed <p> Scenario #1 more closely resembles what you see in real time , and can be easily achieved by setting your camera to a fast shutter speed ( 1/200 second or faster ) . My iPhone was able to capture the thundering falls of Godafoss pretty well at about 1/400 second : <p> Scenario #2 requires more effort to achieve results . To get that smooth , blurred effect on the falls , you want to aim for a shutter speed of 1/30 second or slower , which presents some difficulties <p> First , with a slower shutter speed ( anything slower than 1/60 generally ) , you 'll have to contend with camera shake . Unless you are exceedingly skilled at holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate some blur in your image . The best way to prevent camera shake with a slow shutter speed is to : <p> Use a tripod . <p> Put the camera on 2-second self timer mode so that it has time to still after you press the shutter . <p> Second , you will likely get an overexposed image in the midday sun at a slow shutter speed . There may be too much light to get a decent shot at 1/30 second or slower . Here are a few ways you can combat the too-much-light problem : <p> Try shooting the waterfall on a cloudy day , or close to sunrise/sunset when there 's less light . <p> Use a neutral density ( ND ) or polarizing filter on your lens . These filters cut down on the amount of light entering the sensor , allowing you to shoot at a slower shutter speed than you 'd be able to otherwise . Note : Check out this webpage for the lo-down on which filter to choose . <p> Both photos of Godafoss are *technically good* , but stylistically are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wrong it 's all a matter of preference .

Thankfully my recipe for shooting the Northern Lights in Iceland is about as simple as it gets : <p> Use a tripod <p> Set your camera to 2-second self timer mode ( to prevent camera shake ) <p> Set the shutter speed to 30 seconds <p> Keep the ISO as low as possible to prevent grain in the image <p> Adjust the aperture so that the image is properly exposed ( i.e. not too dark or too bright ) <h> What Iceland photography tips do you have to add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> My only camera is my iPhone .

I went to Iceland several times growing up , but would love to return now to photograph it properly ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Thanks , Silvia !

@@118792668 @7792668/ <h> The Solo Travelers Guide To Phillip Island <p> Ill be honest : I never planned to visit Phillip Island during my year on the Australia work and holiday visa , nor during my 6-month stint living in Melbourne . I briefly entertained the idea of doing a Phillip Island excursion with my friend Nicki while she was visiting from NYC , but after a quick Google search she said what I 'd been thinking : " mehhhhh , I 'm not really impressed " . <p> I was n't sure that penguins and The Pinnacles ( literally the only 2 things I knew existed on the island ) were worth a trip there , but earlier this year I found myself in Melbourne with a handful of days between house sit and sublet and unsure of where to go . When I realized how easy it was to get to Phillip Island by public transport , I said what the heck why not check it out . <p> Turns out , Phillip Island is an incredible place . I am baffled at how little has been written or blogged about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a guide to Phillip Island . Do n't  make the mistake I very nearly made make time for Phillip Island on your Australia trip , or consider Phillip Island for a weekend getaway if you 're living in Melbourne . <p> here 's everything you need to know about traveling solo , without a car , and on a budget to Phillip Island . <h> Getting To Phillip Island By Public Transport <p> Phillip Island is a 2 hour drive from Melbourne , but it 's also very easy to get to by public transport : <p> Train to Dandenong AU$3.90 one way , use your Myki . <p> VLine bus to Cowes ( or anywhere on Phillip Island ) AU$7.60 one way to Cowes , slightly less if you 're getting off sooner . Buy ticket at the counter in Dandenong Station . <p> If the VLine bus terminates before Phillip Island , change at Anderson for the free South Coast bus to Cowes ( usually it will connect with the VLine for a guaranteed transfer ) . <p> Even better , Phillip Island has recently introduced the Island Explorer bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circuit around the island , reaching each stop every 2 hours or so from 10am-5pm . Depending on where you 're going , you may have to sit on the bus for awhile as it makes its way around the island but with a little smart planning , you might be able to catch the bus on its way back around . Every driver I had was eager to help me get around : they 'll ask where you want to go , then offer to pick you up again later in the day , sometimes at non-designated bus stops if they know to meet you there ahead of time . <p> Seriously , the Island Explorer bus is a game changer for solo travelers to Phillip Island without a car . I would n't have been able to see half of what I did otherwise ! Between this bus and the easy connections from Melbourne , it 's very doable to travel to Phillip Island by public transport . <p> Pyramid Rock . <h> Where To Stay On Phillip Island <p> There are n't many options for budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found to be quite excellent . <h> Hostels on Phillip Island <p> At the moment , there is just one hostel on Phillip Island . The Island Accommodation YHA ( AU$30-40/night for a dorm bed ) in Newhaven is one of the nicest hostels I 've ever stayed in . Everything is new and modern , the kitchen and common rooms on each floor are spacious , and all bunks have outlets so you can safely and conveniently charge your electronics . I had one of my best sleeps in a long time the first night I stayed there , but near the end of my stay there were a lot more people booked in and I woke up super early one morning due to nearby doors slamming shut . Something to be aware of if you 're a light sleeper ! <p> Sunset from the beach in Cowes . <h> Camping on Phillip Island <p> Bushcamping is n't allowed on the island , but there are a few caravan parks in Cowes and San Remo if you 're looking to camp on Phillip Island with the convenience of toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowes Caravan Park ( AU$40-55/night per campsite ) and the view was downright stellar . I loved being able to walk into town via the beach rather than the road it took me less than 15 minutes to reach the pier from the campground . One thing I did n't love was that they charge per campsite , rather than per person ( which is pretty standard in Australia ) not a problem at all if you 're sharing the site with friends , but for solo travelers it 's a bummer . Why would I pay $50 for a teeny-tiny plot of land for myself when I could spend less than that to have a comfortable bed and more amenities at a hostel ? ( Because of the next option , that 's why ! ) <p> Its also worth noting that the campsites are very small and cramped together , which is typical of caravan parks in Australia . You wont have much privacy at all if the park is booked out . <h> Glamping on Phillip Island <p> I highly recommend upgrading your camping experience to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island Glamping can set you up with spacious tent ( AU$120-160/night ) on the campsite of your choice , all kitted out with everything you need for a comfortable stay on the island . I especially appreciated the french press , portable heater ( it gets quite chilly at night , even in summer ) , wine glasses , and comfy air mattress . Plus , the tent is just so nicely decorated ! At the moment they have a few different color schemes , but plan to expand their tent offerings once they get their own land ( hopefully by next summer ) . <h> Phillip Island Beaches <p> If you 're a beach person like I am , then you 'll be more than happy with the beaches on Phillip Island . The northern coast , near Cowes , has quiet beaches with calm waters fit for swimming and boating . I did n't find them to be the most beautiful beaches on Phillip Island , but I did find Red Rocks to be quite pretty ( about a half hour walk west from Cowes Caravan Park ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all the surf beaches are . Surfing is absolutely massive here ! Even if you do n't surf , these beaches are devastatingly beautiful and more than fit for sunbathing and wading in the water . <p> The aptly named Surf Beach is a stunner . How often do you see such colorful cliffs leading down to the sand ? <p> Woolamai Surf Beach is an insanely popular surf spot , but it 's so expansive that you 'll easily find a quiet plot of sand for yourself . The views looking south down Cape Woolamai are delightful , but the views from above the beach on the walking track are to die for ! <h> Phillip Island Walks <p> The best way to enjoy Phillip Islands glorious coastline is to walk it . Here are a few great walks on Phillip Island : <h> The Nobbies to the Penguin Parade <p> From The Nobbies , there is a dirt path ( dubbed an alternate road ) that winds along the coast to where the Penguin Parade is . Its only a few kilometers long and takes about 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the perfect distance to cover with plenty of stops for photo ops , and still make it to the Penguin Parade bus stop within 2 hours to catch the next Island Explorer bus . <p> You 're gon na want to explore this part of the Phillip Island coastline with the blowholes and plentiful rock formations , its absolutely a stunner . <h> Cape Woolamai <p> If you do just one of the walks on Phillip Island , make it Cape Woolamai . In particular , the track from Woolamai Surf Beach to the Pinnacles and back is stellar . At certain points , you can see nearly the entire cape and several miles of island coastline . <h> San Remo <p> San Remo is technically not on Phillip Island , but it 's the town just before the bridge onto the island and has some great coastline worth exploring . There is a coastal walk that runs south from the bridge , which provides views toward the island until it curves east along the Bass Coast . I did n't have time to do this walk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding that 's done around noon every day . <h> Phillip Island Activities <p> More than any other Melbourne getaway destination , Phillip Island seems to have made massive leaps in the tourism game . As a result , there are a lot of tourist attractions on offer here but its a good thing , because many of them funnel money right back into protecting the wildlife on the island . <h> The Nobbies <p> At the southwest point of Phillip Island you 'll find the Nobbies , a rocky outcrop where thousands of sea lions have made their home . You ca n't see the seals from here , but you can walk along the boardwalk to catch some fantastic coastal views . <p> The newly-opened Antarctic Journey is worth a look if you need a break from the sun or want to get your learning on . I loved the cinema room that had numerous screens showing scenes from Antarctica . <h> Eco Cruise To See The Sea Lions <p> If you want to sea the sea lion colony at Phillip Island , hop on an eco cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , so if you 're prone to motion sickness you might want to think twice about taking it . En route to the seals , the captain tried to catch some waves to up the excitement factor . My butt flew off the seat a bunch of times , and all I could think was oh god , be still my stomach ! <p> There are some seriously beautiful patches of coastline once you get out toward the Nobbies . The boat stops for awhile at the sea lion rocks so you have plenty of time to watch and take photos or in my case , plenty of time to sprawl out on some chairs and attempt to tame the motion sickness monster . I suspect I 'm not the only victim , as the staff were quick to pass me a barf bag and some ginger candies to quell the nausea . <h> Penguin Parade <p> Unfortunately I missed my night to see the penguins because I was still feeling woozy from the eco cruise , but every evening you can book a ticket to watch the penguins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island is probably most known for its penguins , so I 'd deem this a must-do if you 're going to splash out for any one paid activity here . Note that no photography of any sort is allowed during it . <p> The seating at the Penguin Parade . <h> Wine Tasting <p> You might not guess that Phillip Island hosts a couple of great wineries , but it sure does ! Purple Hen Winery is open daily for $5 wine tastings ( credited toward any bottle purchase ) . Servings are generous and plentiful I 'd been planning on enjoying a glass of Chardonnay outside there , but was well into the tipsy phase after the tasting so I bought a bottle to bring back to Cowes , which I enjoyed on the beach at sunset that night . Highly recommend their Sparkling Shiraz it 's not something you 'll find often , and plus it 's downright delicious . <p> The gravel road leading to the winery is worth a wander as well : you can catch glimpses of the water from the eastern side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may even come across a wallaby crossing the road . <p> View from the road to the winery . <h> Churchill Island <p> Not long after entering Phillip Island , you can turn north onto a road that leads to the much smaller Churchill Island . There 's a farm here with some great walking and cycling tracks that offer countryside views . <h> Other Activities ( For Kids ) <p> I did n't try any of these kid-friendly activities , but they 're excellent options for families and kids at heart : <p> A Maze N Things A " world of optical illusions , mazes and puzzles that will entertain , intrigue and amuse adults and children for hours " . Also features a mini-golf course and the highest indoor vertical slide in the Southern Hemisphere . <p> Koala Sanctuary If you have n't seen a koala up close during your Australian travels , here 's your chance . <p> Rhyll Trout &amp; Bush Tucker Farm You can catch a trout and they 'll cook it up for you here . <p> Wine and cider at The Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot topic on this blog , I have to give props to The Cape Kitchen for their top notch dining experience . With their aesthetically-assembled dishes and floor-to-ceiling windows yielding front-row views of the water , this restaurant is instagram heaven . All of their dishes are made with local ingredients sourced entirely from Victoria . <p> The best coffee on Phillip Island is at Mendls Coffee House , a brand new cafe in Cowes serving Melbourne-caliber coffee . They also have a lovely space in which to linger with a book , meal , or laptop . <h> Disclaimer : I 'd already had my 2nd trip to Phillip Island booked when I won an Instagram contest put on by Destination Phillip Island , so my prize allowed me to upgrade my trip and make a few more adventures possible . Special thanks to Phillip Island Glamping and The Cape Kitchen for some incentives I may receive . <h> Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Hi Lindsay , I would like to check with you if glamping alone as a female is dangerous .

@@118792669 @7792669/ <h> 21 of the The Best Views of Sydney <p> I 've had the pleasure and privilege of living in two of the most fantastic cities in the world : New York and Sydney . While the fast paced , cut throat NYC lifestyle contrasts sharply with the casual beach bum mantra of Sydney , I found myself drawn to certain things that both cities do super well : coffee ( NYC / SYD ) , street art ( NYC / SYD ) , and city views ( NYC ) . <p> And just as I 've documented the best views of NYC , I 've done the same for Sydney . From beaches , bridges , and hilltop parks , here are the best views of Sydney ( 21 , in fact ! ) <h> FROM ABOVE <h> The Air <p> It 's a thrill flying into most any major city , but the moment you spot the Sydney Opera House while circling around Sydney Harbour will trigger goosebumps . Tell me : is there a city that looks more stunning from the air ? <h> Sydney Harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge . What I love about crossing this bridge is that the city view is constantly changing as you approach the other side : from the tight-angle view of Circular Quay over Dawes Point to having ferries and waterways in the foreground as you 're further out on the bridge . <p> For bonus points , sign yourself up for BridgeClimb : an exhilarating ( and pricey ) adventure climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge ! I have n't done it ( because *ahem* , frugal ) , but I imagine the views are very similar to those you get crossing on foot just with an added dose or two of adrenaline . <h> FROM THE CITY <h> Circular Quay <p> If you want to see Sydney up close and personal , head straight to its heart and traipse around Circular Quay . You 'll feel dwarfed by the Sydney Opera House as you stand on its steps , and by the massive cruise ship that 's nearly always docked on the western side of the Quay . <h> The Royal Botanic Gardens <p> Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and trees , but if it 's city views you 're after , head to the waterfront walkway on the northern end of the park . Here you can have the best of both worlds : views of the Sydney Opera House framed by local flora . The best view can be had at the outermost point of the park in front of Mrs. Macquarie 's Chair . <p> If you 're looking for the best view of the Sydney NYE Fireworks , snagging a ticket to one of the parties in the Botanic Garden will just about guarantee it for you . I did this in December 2014 and it was one of the best splurges I 've ever had ! <h> The Observatory <p> I think Sydney 's Observatory is one of its most underrated attractions , but even if you 're not keen on learning about its astronomical history , it 's well worth trekking up to Observatory Hill to enjoy a picnic with a view . <h> FROM THE WATER <h> The Sydney Ferries <p> Sydney 's ferries are pretty expensive for point-to-point transfers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic boat rides , it 's money well spent . Depending on which way you head , you 'll either pass beneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge or curve around the Sydney Opera House . <p> One of my absolute favorite Sydney Things to do is catch the ferry to Manly Beach on a Sunday , where transport costs are capped at AU$2.50 for the entire day . Given that the ferry to Manly normally costs about AU$7 one way , the Sunday trip to Manly is such good value . <h> Cockatoo Island <p> I do n't know why I waited til my very last day in Sydney to visit Cockatoo Island , but I really wish I 'd devoted a whole summer day to this former prison site / new UNESCO World Heritage site rather than just sunset drinks at Island Bar . You can tour the old convict buildings , play tennis , drink and dine , and even camp on this island all with a distant view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and city skyline . <h> Fort Denison <p> I have n't yet made it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my to-do list upon my eventual return to Sydney . In former years , it was an old penal site and defense facility , but these days it functions as a museum , event venue , and popular tourist attraction in Sydney . It also boasts THE BEST view of the Sydney NYE Fireworks ( and the most expensive , at AU$1250 for admission ) . <p> Being smack in the middle of Sydney Harbour , you 'll take in a postcard-worthy panoramic view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge unobstructed by the Sydney Opera House . If you make it out to Fort Denison , try to time your visit with the daily 1pm cannon firing ( or around it , if you hate loud noises like I do ! ) . <p> I took this photo while on a ferry , but Fort Denison is *just* to my left here , so the view is almost the same . <h> FROM THE EASTERN SUBURBS <h> Gap Park <p> The walk from South Head to Watsons Bay is sensational because not only do you get to enjoy dramatic coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also if you turn to look in nearly the opposite direction you 'll spot the Sydney skyline just beyond the harbour bays and the hilly landscape of the Eastern Suburbs . <h> Watsons Bay Beach <p> The Gap Bluff to Watsons Bay walk concludes at Watsons Bay Beach , but you can also easily access this beach via ferry or bus . It 's not so much a beach meant for sunbathing or swimming , but you wo n't be out of place dining at Doyle 's on the waterfront or taking a SUP lesson in Watsons Bay both complete with a distant view of Sydney . <h> Camp Cove Beach <p> If you 're embarking on the aforementioned Gap Bluff to Watsons Bay walk , you 'll eventually hit the orange-sanded Camp Cove Beach . There 's a partial view of the city from this beach , but if you climb up to the headland on the right side , you 'll be rewarded with an even better one . <h> Nielsen Park <p> Nielsen Park is highly popular amongst local families , due to its many picnic areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial city view from the beach that 's very similar to the one afforded at Camp Cove , but you can do better by following the trail that hugs the harbour and leads west toward Rose Bay . Once you 're up on the headland on the left side of the beach , look for a subtle path that leads off the trail and out to a big rock that overlooks the harbour . Here you 'll find a clear view straight across to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House . <h> Milk Beach <p> This semi-secret local 's beach on Rose Bay boasts an uncrowded stretch of sand with a prime view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge . It 's also one of the best beach spots for a chilled out swim . <h> Vaucluse <p> It 's hardly surprising that one of Sydney 's richest suburbs owns a million-dollar view of Sydney Harbour and the city skyline . Take a walk around this hilltop neighborhood and gawk at the impressive estates perched over the water . How lucky are the students at the clifftop Kincoppal-Rose Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view like this ? <h> Dudley Page Reserve <p> I do n't reckon the average visitor or even local would likely find themselves wandering around the random neighborhood of Dover Heights , but just in case you happen to hit this eastern suburb square between North Bondi and Rose Bay : there 's a big park on a hill overlooking Sydney Harbour that 's just made for catching the sunset . <h> FROM NORTH SYDNEY <h> Luna Park <p> Possibly the most obvious ( and popular , and awesome ) spot for glimpsing the Sydney skyline , crossing to the other side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge does n't ever disappoint . You can walk all along the waterfront from Luna Park around Milsons Point and catch the bridge , Sydney Opera House , and CBD skyline from myriad angles . <h> McMahons Point <p> Slightly westward from Luna Park is McMahons Point , a semi-private neighborhood that looks straight out at the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House . Best of all , it 's not a popular tourist site like the area around Luna Park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> FROM THE OUTER HARBOUR <h> Cremorne Point <p> Accessible via the Mosman to Cremorne harbour walk or by ferry from Circular Quay , Cremorne is a northern suburb nestled seemingly just around the corner from the city . The big flat rocks along the waterfront make for a fab picnic spot , but it 's far more thrilling to enjoy the view from Maccallum Pool . <h> Taronga <p> Sydney 's Taronga Zoo has got to be one of the most scenic zoos there is , but even if you do n't want to pay the hefty price of admission to gawk at various Aussie animals , you can still take the ferry to Taronga and walk along Sydney Harbour and see approximately the same city views ( albeit sans giraffe heads in the way ) . <h> Georges Head <p> Georges Head is a popular venue for weddings and other events , and rightfully so : from it , you have a 180-degree view of the city skyline , several harbour beaches , and North Head . <h> North Head <p> For sweeping vistas of outer Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headland in the harbour . You can drive or catch the occasional bus from Manly , but it 's more fun to cycle to North Head or walk there via the scenic trail . No matter your mode of transport , be sure to make a picnic out of it and catch the sun setting over Sydney . <h> Which do you think are the best views of Sydney ? Any to add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792670 @7792670/ <h> El Nido : When Travel Dreams Do n't  Quite Come True <p> I 'd been lusting over El Nido for YEARS before I finally made my way to the Philippines for a month last September . Epic sunsets over limestone karsts and boat trips to hidden lagoons and secret beaches ? I mean- for crying out loud , I could n't conjure up a more idyllic scene if I tried . <p> Only thing is I 'd be- traveling at the tail end of monsoon season , which meant the weather would be a complete crapshoot . I tried to stack the odds in my favor by scheduling El Nido towards the end of my trip , in early October , thinking that maybe the rain would taper off by then . <p> Of course I followed along on social media as other travelers made their way to El Nido shortly before I was due to arrive , most of them bemoaning nonstop rain and cutting their time in Palawan short due to the horrendous weather . I had 8 days allotted for El Nido surely I 'd luck out with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't  look too promising as we flew into El Nido Airport . <p> here 's the thing about weather : there 's absolutely- nothing you can do to change it . I 've had plenty of trips dampened ( pun intended ) by lackluster weather , which of course is not an ideal scenario , but you just have to make the best of it . Yes , even in a place- whose main attraction is island hopping tours , and whose scenic beauty is derived from sun-drenched- aquatic landscapes . <h> Diving in El Nido <p> So on a soggy- Day 1 , I marched into the first dive shop I found and signed up for a diving trip the following day . No one comes to El Nido to dive , but diving is- an excellent rainy day activity so I thought , why not . Would it have been more enjoyable to have our lunch on the top deck of the dive boat , soaking up the sun and the surrounding vistas in-between dives ? Absolutely . But hey , I got to swim with a turtle so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . <h> What To Do In El Nido When It Rains <p> The next few days I hedged my bets and held off on signing up for an island hopping tour . I 'm optimistic AF , but when the forecast predicts 100% chance of rain , I feel like there is no possible way the days- going to turn out sunny . Partly cloudy at best maybe , but- definitely not great- for beach bumming- all day . <p> Instead , I holed up at El Nido Boutique and Art Cafe with my laptop to work and drink smoothies all day ( note to digital nomads : this is one of the few places in town with wifi , but its- shit-tastic ) . It felt like half of the town had the same idea nearly every table was occupied all day long with friends drinking beers , nibbling on snacks , and staring despondently out at the torrential rain . <p> What else is there to do in El Nido when it rains ? Not much , my friends , aside from diving , drinking , and hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I got- so much work and writing done during these rainy days . There was n't much in the way of distractions to keep me from being productive . <p> I was also far more social than I normally am- while traveling : instead of being out all day- adventuring and in all night reading and writing , I went- super stir crazy and was in dire need of some stimulation outside of my screens . <p> In very un-Lindsay-like fashion , one night I played drinking games in a hostel with some backpackers I 'd met on my diving trip and then- hit up Reggae Bar ( aka Pukka Bar ) , the so-called hotspot in town . I also gasp ! made friends with people in my hostel dorm room ! You know , normal things for most backpackers . ( I never claimed to be normal though , now did I ? ) <p> At the first sign of sun ( well , more like dryness ) , I hopped in a habal-habal- with my new travel blogging friends Amy and Mike of A Nomadic Existence- and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hour of sun before the clouds returned , but at least we got to lay out in the sand for a bit . <p> Nacpan Beach is the one I 'd really wanted to visit , but apparently it takes over an hour to reach and we only had a tiny window of sunshine in which to venture out . <p> There 's actually a zip line that runs from this beach to that little island . <h> Island Hopping in El Nido <p> The first half of my time in El Nido washed out- with the rain , but- I refused to- leave without doing the thing I ( and everyone else ) came here to do : island hopping . <p> The forecast looked a bit less depressing during the second half of my trip , so with fingers crossed I signed up for two El Nido island hopping tours with El Nido Boutique &amp; Art Cafe : Tour A and Tour C.- These are the two most popular tours in El Nido , and I along with most every other online resource out there recommend that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island hopping trips in El Nido . There are numerous vendors across town and they all offer the same tours with little-to-no variation. - Sorry guys , I had every intention of going off the beaten path and taking Tours B and D as well , but there was n't much point doing them in the rain and I had to prioritize the few dry-ish days I had. - <h> Tour A <p> Tour A is all about kayaking in the lagoons . I 'd highly recommend reserving a kayak to use at the time you book this tour , but if you do n't  you can probably rent- one from the locals when you reach the first lagoon . Personally , I preferred to have my kayak all ready to go the second we arrived so that I could- get into the lagoon before the rest of the tour groups , rather than waste precious time mucking around with the rental onsite . <p> The kayaks are meant for two people , so I got paired up with another solo traveler who was keen to stay ahead of the pack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out perfectly . <p> It did n't  matter so much that we were kayaking in mostly cloudy conditions because thankfully the lagoon water was vibrant even without the sun . <p> The beaches we stopped at , however not so photogenic in these conditions . It rained while we were at the last beach , which I felt made for an opportune time to sip on fresh coconut water spiked with rum . <h> Tour C <p> Tour C is all about islands and beaches . This ones heavy on snorkeling , so definitely either bring your snorkel gear or rent it from anywhere in town the morning of your tour . I 'd also strongly recommend renting some reef shoes for this tour as well , as- you might have to make your way from the boat to shore on foot when the tides low . Having reef shoes let me prance straight from boat to beach before everyone else , who had to gingerly step over dead reef and rocks while barefoot . I still ca n't believe I got this shot without anyone inside ! <p> I- got so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 I spent here- coinciding with the most beautiful scenery I 'd see in Palawan . We had a great group on this trip , too it was me with Amy and Mike , plus two girls I 'd recruited from my hostel . <p> It was such a magical day ! We snorkeled , sunbathed , had little photoshoots on the bangka boat , and finally got our postcard-worthy photos of this sensational- corner of the world . It was easily one of the best days of my entire month in the Philippines . <h> Thoughts On El Nido <p> There 's no way around it : the terrible weather I got handed- had a negative impact on my enjoyment of El Nido . <p> For me , photos are- everything on a trip . I intuitively know that the most important thing is being present and enjoying every moment and every experience as it unfolds , but I cant seem to shake the idea that the entire photo-taking process is a core component of my overall travel experience . So when I 'm not able to shoot due to crap- weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light conditions that look like I took 10 separate trips to one location , Im bummed . Super bummed . <p> I spent- so much time trying to edit these photos into what I 'd envisioned El Nido would look like in real life , but then I decided that was silly . Most days while I was there , El Nido looked nothing like a postcard . So guess what , we 've got a big ol mismatched white balance party going on up in here . <p> Lackluster photos aside , - I missed out on a few things I 'd really wanted to do in El Nido because of the rain . I did n't  get to climb Taraw Cliff for an aerial view over town , or get that shot between the two bays at Nacpan Beach . I never witnessed one of those- famously stunning- El Nido sunsets over Bacuit Bay . And considering I 'd allotted EIGHT DAYS to enjoy this destination , I could n't help but feel frustrated , and like I 'd wasted a small chunk of my limited time in the Philippines stuck inside staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , its pointless fretting about the weather or anything else that 's out of your control . I do feel like I made the most out of the foul weather cards I was dealt I 'm just also a bit disappointed that the whole experience did n't  live up to what I guess were my lofty expectations . <p> In short : I 'm glad I went to El Nido , it just was n't my favorite part of the Philippines like I imagined it would be. - <p> The only decent sunset I got at El Nido . <h> Have you ever had a trip tainted by bad weather ?

I took a shuttle van for 500PHP ( US$10 ) , but a coach bus should be slightly cheaper .

Beds in a dorm room start at 1000PHP ( US$20 ) per night . If you 're on an extreme budget , look at the beloved Our Melting Pot hostel instead . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118792672 @7792672/ <h> Biking the Cape Cod Rail Trail <p> If it 's anything like mine , it 'll involve beach hopping from bay side to ocean side , sampling as much clam chowder as you can stomach , making a trip up to Provincetown for shopping and general merriment , and perhaps a night at the Wellfleet drive-in . <h> About the Cape Cod Rail Trail <p> A paved pathway running about 25 miles from South Dennis north to Wellfleet , the Cape Cod Rail Trail makes for a safe and scenic ride up the central Cape . It runs alongside what used to be the Cape Cod railroad tracks , which were torn up in the 1960 's in favor of bridges and America 's beloved automobile . With nary a remnant , it 's hard to envision freight trains once rumbling up and down the Cape , though . <p> The CCRT passes through 6 towns : Dennis , Harwich , Brewster , Orleans , Eastham and Wellfleet . There are bike rental shops all along the way , just off the trail most of which will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very affordable , and vary by outlet we paid $20 for 5 hours at Barb 's Bike Shop , which is stationed at the very start of the trail in Dennis . <h> What 's the Cape Cod Rail Trail like ? <h> The scenery along the Cape Cod Rail Trail is quite diverse <p> There are cranberry bogs in Dennis , though I did n't  photograph them because they 're rather bland looking outside of harvest season . Visit in the fall , and you 'll see vibrant red just off the trail . <p> Through Harwich , you 'll pass by several lakes thatll make you question whether you came to the Cape to see the beaches . The trail enters the town of Brewster at Nickerson State Park , where my family spent many a camping trip back in the day . From Brewster to Orleans , the scenery goes from marshes to forest . <p> In Eastham and Wellfleet , the trail meets Rt 6 , where you can veer off to stop at an ocean beach .

There are families that stick together on the trail , keeping pace with the slowest member of their clan , that you 'll likely want to pass by . But there are also people in proper cycling attire with fancier bikes who are in it to rack up miles and therefore whip past everyone on the trail . <p> You can bike the whole CCRT , or just a segment of it at any pace . Every .1 of a mile there are mile markers spray painted on the ground , informing cyclists how far into the trail they are , and which town they 're currently in . <p> What 's more , you do n't  even have to cycle !

@@118792673 @7792673/ <h> A Tip Sheet For Trekking To Waimanu Valley in Hawaii <p> I do n't  know about you , but the trips I take tend to be planned around one particular thing Ive been aching to see or do . In the case of my 2012 road trip around the Big Island of Hawaii , the one thing I just HAD to do was trek to Waimanu Valley on the Muliwai Trail . A coastal walk with glorious views of the rugged Hawaiian coastline , leading you to an off-the-beaten-path paradisaical oasis ? Oh I 'm SO there . <p> If you 're into it too , here 's a tip sheet I 've created for trekking to Waimanu Valley : everything you need to know to prepare , complete , and enjoy this Hawaiian hike . <h> Before You Go <h> Book your campsite ahead of time <p> Be sure to book one of the 9 campsites before you go , and bring a printout of your permit with you on the hike . You can book a Waimanu campsite online for $18/night . You really need to stay AT LEAST 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spent hiking rather than enjoying the valley . The more nights you can afford there , the better trust me on this ! <p> My roommate Lauren and I were there at the very end of January 2012 and only 2 other sites were taken . We had campsite #2 , which was the largest and dare I say , the best site , with easy access to the beach and a front-row view of the valley and surrounds . Sites 6-9 are more spaced out and less trafficked . <h> Bring appropriate gear <p> Being properly equipped for this trek is absolutely key to your enjoyment of it . Keep in mind , you are carrying everything you need to survive for a few days in the wilderness on your back : your tent , your food , your sleeping bag , your clothes , your random crap . You WILL feel this weight after several hours of carrying it . If you do not have a high quality backpack , comfortable hiking shoes , and trekking poles you will be in a world of pain ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waimanu Valley trek : <p> Note : The links above are for the products I actually used on this trek , or the closest thing I could find to it . <p> Walking across Waipio Beach with all our gear <h> Stock up on food once on the island <p> Whatever you plan on consuming while in the valley you 'll need to bring in with you . Assuming you 'll fly into Hilo or Kona , hit the supermarket in one of those cities to stock up on supplies before you hike in . Some easy , hearty meals you can cook over a campfire are vegetarian chili and pasta . These may not be the lightest items to pack in your bag , but your body will thank you for feeding it proper meals after all that trekking , vs. chips and candy and other crap food . <h> Getting There <h> Where to park <p> Aim for the Waipio Valley Lookout when looking for a place to park your car during the trek . Based on this source , we had planned to leave our car at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to fork over some money to ensure its safekeeping . But when we got there the morning we were to start the trek , the gallery was closed . You may have to call and pre-arrange your parking with them , but we did n't know this beforehand . <p> We came up with an impromptu Plan B , which was to return to the lookout and start driving down to the beach . This road is no joke it is steep as all hell , and you have to CRAWL down it ever-so-carefully . Coming back up is equally challenging I would n't attempt this in anything other than a 4WD car . Once you 've made it through the steep part , you 'll reach level ground as the road continues toward the beach . We found a little clearing on the left side of the road in the trees where another car was parked , so we left our car there and hoped for the best ! Our guidebook recommended leaving car doors unlocked with all valuables removed to discourage break-ins . From there , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start the trek . <p> Waipio Beach . See all those switchbacks heading up the cliff ? ROUGH . <h> On the trail <p> From Waipio to Waimanu , it 's 9 miles of constant up-and-down hiking . The first mile is fraught with switchbacks as you climb out of Waipio Valley and will demand at least half of your water supply . The remaining 8 miles are slightly less strenuous , but after several hours in the sun carrying heavy weight on your back , you will feel it . Aside from a couple small waterfalls along the way , there 's not too much in the way of scenic vistas on the trail because you 're hiking slightly inland rather than right on the coastline . <p> While I typically try to enjoy the journey as much as the destination ( if not more ) , I have to say that in this case it was ALL about the destination . The entire time I just wanted to get to Waimanu Valley and collapse in my hammock . That 's not to say the trail is boring or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Rather , I was ill-equipped with a mediocre backpack that did not distribute weight well . I found that rearranging my items alleviated some of the pain : for instance , you do n't  want to attach your tent or sleeping gear to the very bottom of your backpack , but rather center it vertically down the front of your pack . The shoulder pain was nearly unbearable at times , and all I could do was count down the helipads we passed as we approached our promised land . <p> View over Waipio Valley and beach . <p> The trail undulates in and out , up and down . Each time we rounded a corner , I prayed that it would be the last one though clearly , most times it was n't . But once you do reach that final corner , you 're rewarded with a stunning view of the coastline , not unlike the one from the Waipi'o Lookout . Be warned that the descent into the valley is steep , and if there 's been any recent rain ( likely there will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is when you 'll thank yourself for lugging along your trekking poles to help keep your balance . <h> In Waimanu Valley <p> I quickly forgot about the hardships we 'd endured on the trail once we arrived at Waimanu Valley because , well , look at it : <p> View of Waimanu Beach <p> This Hawaiian shangri-la was the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel for us , and I was about two seconds away from hugging trees and kissing the ground in gratitude before I got distracted by our new digs . The beach ! The valley ! Waterfalls ! And ooh , two perfectly-spaced trees from which to hang my hammock ! <p> We had nearly two full days to enjoy Waimanu Valley , Robinson Crusoe-style . We did n't  do much other than just be , but there are a few things there worth mentioning : <h> The Beach <p> With all campsites nestled between the beach and the valley , there 's no escaping the black sandy shores of Waimanu . Not that you 'd want to this is Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for a bit of a swim , while I laid back in my hammock enjoying a view of the water on one side and the valley on the other . <h> Coconuts <p> Despite all the research I 'd done beforehand , there was one thing that surprised me on this trek : all the harvestable coconuts at Waimanu Valley ! There are few things more gratifying than knocking down a coconut from a tree on a hot day , breaking it open yourself , and quenching your thirst with some fresh coconut water . Coconuts with a browner shell are older and house delicious coconut water for drinking , while those with a greener shell are younger and better suited for eating the flesh inside . Our harvesting technique was less than refined : all we had was a butter knife and some rocks to smash the coconuts into . Once in awhile , we 'd bother our Mountain Man neighbor and use his machete to cut them open . <h> Water(falls) <p> Whenever thirst or restlessness hit , we 'd venture through the other campsites toward the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , of course ) . Following the foot path inland from the stream , it would theoretically lead us to the waterfalls that we could see from our campsite . But what do you do when the path suddenly vanishes and you 're in the middle of the woods ? If you 're me , you follow a hunch and head off in one direction before getting hopelessly lost and bitten by bugs . It was the most puzzling thing because we could hear the falls and get close to the stream leading out from it , but no path we took led us to the actual waterfall . Following the stream up to the falls was impossible with all the overgrown bush , fallen trees , and other obstacles standing in the way . When our frustration reached an intolerable level , we decided to cut our losses and head back to camp . <p> Per my post-trip research , it should have taken us about an hour to hike to the falls . I suspect we lost the trail early on and should have gone further out in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no matter much like in Pai , Thailand , the best thing to do in Waimanu Valley is nothing ! <h> Post-Hike <p> Trekking out was slightly less arduous without carrying cans of non-perishable food on our backs , but it would have been wise to leave early enough in the day to complete the hike before sundown . We were hiking down the steep switchbacks into Waipio with limited light , which was n't the safest way to go . <p> Upon reaching the gorgeous Waipio Beach at sunset , where our epic trek had begun , we said screw it let 's camp here for the night . Lauren set up the tent , I hung up my hammock , and we made instant mashed potatoes for dinner . I woke up the next morning to see a Hawaiian beach sunrise on my 27th birthday does n't  get much better than that ! <p> Trekking to Waimanu Valley is one of the greatest adventures I 've ever had . If you take it on , just be sure to come prepared ! 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find myself doing it ) , this hike does look pretty nice . I love Hawaii , it is so gorgeous ! <p> Is the camp site more like glamping or camping ? Would I have to bring my own equipment or is everything provided ? : D <p> shannaberryblast <p> Camping . Nothing but some outhouses ( which were glamorous compared to what I 'm used to which is popping a squat in a bush ! ) . You can tone down your gear by bringing a hammock instead of a tent , but its a rugged adventure . You must purify your own water as well , no fresh clean water here . Its well worth the trip but you will need to take a ton of gear with you . My husband and I did this hike 2 years ago on our honeymoon and though we are avid hikers always seeking adventure we were not prepared . We are going back in a week to do it again with better packs , better gear , and more experience ! And it STILL wont be easy , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> awesome hike ! My brother and I do it every other year when we return for Christmas vacation . Its great when the waterfall , on the trail was actually flowing . It is the perfect rest point . To any future hikers , you 're going to get about 3/4 the way up the very first valley wall and you 're going to wonder if you are in over your head . Just keep pushing to the top then the rest is a breeze from there . Completely worth it every time . 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> YES , love that tip so so true ! We thought we were gon na die during that , but thankfully you get the worst out of the way at the very beginning . Definitely worth it . So envious that you get to do this hike again and again ! : ) <p> I was on the Hawaiian Islands for 3 collective weeks , this past October . I had the time of my life . My husband and I backpacked the Haleakala Crater in Maui and the Kalalau Trail in Kauai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but it will have to wait for another time . Thanks for providing the details : ) If you have n't hiked the Kalalau Trail , you will love it . <p> We did n't  have any problems when we did this ! A guide we read recommended leaving our rental car there unlocked so that thieves would n't try to smash the windows and break in . In the end I cant remember whether we did , but we were fine leaving it there . 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118792677 @7792677/ <h> 10 Worthwhile Stops To Make On Your Iceland Road Trip <p> A few months ago , I embarked on an 8-day road trip around all of Iceland . While 8 days does little justice to the natural wonders Iceland has to offer roadtrippers , its sufficient time to get a good feel for this incredible country . <p> The scenery from the Ring Road is enough to entertain , but there 's plenty worth stopping off to see as well . Definitely make the effort to check out a waterfall , go for a quick hike , or take a dip in a natural hot pool along the way . <p> I 've handpicked my Top 10 favorite stops to make on an Iceland road trip below . Immerse yourself in the landscapes you 've seen from inside the car and check these spots out ! <p> Clockwise around the Ring Road , from Reykjavik : <h> 1 . Erpssta+ir <p> I have to give Lonely Planet credit for this one . We were looking for something to break up the lengthy drive from Reykjavik to the Westfjords , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a good idea . This dairy farm specializes in homemade ice cream , but also sells local goods and offers tours of the grounds . Our one-track minds went for the ice cream and were subsequently blown by it . Try the vanilla or the coconut ! <p> Location : Rte 60 between B++ardalur and the Ring Road . <h> 2 . Drangsnes <p> One of my favorite moments in Iceland happened in Drangsnes . I dare you to find a more satisfying travel experience than relaxing in a natural hot tub nestled into the Icelandic coast , swapping stories with the locals . Best of all , this town is so tiny and so off the grid that it is zero parts touristic . If your schedule permits , definitely try to get up to these hot pots in the Westfjords ! <p> Location : Westfjords , on Rte 645. <h> 3 . Godafoss <p> There are about 80 kerjillion waterfalls in Iceland , but I 'd peg Godafoss as one of the best value falls in the country : i.e. one of the biggest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to . Not too long after passing through Akureyri , the Ring Road will lead you right to the falls . There 's a path on either side of the river that you can amble down to get a close-up from above , but it 's far more thrilling to follow the track on the left side that leads right down to the water . You 'll get soaked with mist in this front row seat , so mind your camera equipment and put on your rain gear ! <p> We camped right by where we 'd parked our car , outside Fossh+ll Guesthouse ( $10/night per person ) , and fell asleep to the sound of the roaring falls . They also have an excellent restaurant , where I splurged and enjoyed one of the few proper meals I had my entire two weeks in Iceland : lamb soup . Worth it ! <p> Location : Ring Road , about a 53km drive east from Akureyri. <h> 4 . Viti Crater <p> The whole area around Myvatn and Hverir is full of geothermal and volcanic goodness it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region . But the real stunner is Viti Crater , a bright blue crater lake about 300m in diameter , nestled on the slopes of Krafla volcano . Whatever you do , make sure you battle the winds and trudge up the slope to the top of the hill for a most excellent view . I guarantee you 'll have a *How does this even exist ? ! * moment . <p> Unbeknownst to us at the time , you can actually swim in this geothermal lake ! You 'd have to hike down a very steep and slippery hill and then back up , but I reckon it 'd be well worth it . <p> Location : About a 20 minute drive from Myvatn , look for signs for Krafla on the north side of the Ring Road and follow the access road in . The parking lot for the crater is at the end . <h> 5 . J+kuls+rl+n <p> Iceland 's famous glacier lagoon is terribly touristy , as evidenced by the loads of tour buses parked beside it and visitors taking selfies by massive chunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J+kuls+rl+n is well worth a stop because really , how often do you get to see icebergs ? <p> To flee the crowd , head across the street to the black sand beach and check out the ice chunks that have washed up on shore . It 's on a much smaller scale than at J+kuls+rl+n proper , but still very cool to see . <p> Location : Ring Road , between H+fn and Skaftafell. <h> 6 . Svartifoss <p> Svartifoss is renowned for its backdrop of dark hexagonal basalt columns . I guarantee you 've seen pictures of this beauty if you 've done any research at all on Iceland . It requires a steady uphill climb from the campground at Skaftafell , but like most all other natural wonders in Iceland : it 's worth it . Once you 're there , be sure to climb up the rocks on the right side for a higher vantage point ; then , stare at those columns until you 're speechless with appreciation . <p> Location : About 1.5km or an hour 's hike from the info center at Vatnaj+kull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> File this under Really Cool Things : a massive canyon 100m deep , covered in bright green moss . I highly recommend inching close to the edge until you feel compelled to yell " Holy sh-tballs ! " down into the canyon . Its a little unnerving , but a lotta amazing . GO HERE . <p> Location : Nearly halfway between Vik and Skaftafell ( about an hour 's drive from each ) , near the village of Kirkjub+jarklaustur you 'll turn north off the Ring Road and follow the road down for about 3km. <h> 8 . Hj+rleifsh+f+i <p> I 'd heard about this seaside cliff via another travel blogger and , upon seeing images that promised some serious frolicking amidst green hills , it catapulted to the near-top of my Iceland to-do list . <p> The super-steep 220m climb is daunting , but once you 're up there the rest of the hike is on mostly level ground . You 'll have to hike up a bit more to get to the viking tomb , but it 's well worth the effort for the view it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the black sand and blue water below a scene I still have imprinted in my mind . And , the typical icing on my travel experience cake : we were the only ones there . GLORIOUS . <p> Location : About 10 minutes east of Vik , you 'll see a massive headland leading toward the sea . Look out for a sign for Hj+rleifsh+f+i on the south side of the Ring Road , on the west side of the mountain . Drive down this road , and near the middle of the headland will be a turnoff toward it where you can park and start the hike up . The loop starts and ends here . <h> 9 . Reynisfjara <p> Basically synonymous with an Icelandic black sand beach , Reynisfjara lives up to its hype . No , you wo n't have it to yourself , but do wait your turn to climb up the hexagonal basalt columns because it 's SO MUCH FUN ! <p> The beach itself is gorgeous , with a basalt column cave on shore and a few basalt sea stacks just offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( similar to Hj+rleifsh+f+i ) in the distance . I recommend hitting Reynisfjara late in the day : when the golden light hits the basalt cave , and the sun starts going own over Dyrholaey . <p> Location : About 5 minutes west of Vik , turn south off the Ring Road onto Rte 215 and follow it to the beach . <h> 10 . Hrunalaug Natural Hot Spring <p> I 've already sung praises for this hot river , so I wo n't rehash Hrunalaug here . I love it because its one of the few totally natural hot pools in Iceland i.e. its naturally heated , AND it was n't manmade . You 're literally sitting in the river , and its fantastic . <p> Location : Rte 344 will take you to Hruni . As you enter town , there should be a small hand-painted sign for the hot spring . Just a bit further you 'll take a right , then find a little parking lot a minute later on the left . An easy walk over a hill will get you to the hot spring in about 5 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at your Iceland photos , I get a little sad that I did not extend my trip their either time that I passed through , and now I am longing to go back .

If you stick to the Ring Road , you 'll be fine with a regular car . <p> I actually did n't  keep diligent track of expenses on this trip because we had 4-5 people contributing and its hard to know who paid for what in the end . Wish I could give you an estimate for gas expenses , but it also depends on how much you drive we drove the whole Ring Road plus the Westfjords , so heavy mileage ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792678 @7792678/ <h> A Very Unplanned 5 Day Tasmania Roadtrip <p> I wont deny my tendency to over-plan my days and trips . That 's why it was rather out of character for me to hardly plan a thing for my Tasmania trip this past January . My Aussie friend Teresa and I had been chatting about traveling together once I arrived in Australia and almost immediately decided on a Tasmania roadtrip . here 's how our planning went down : <p> Teresa booked her flights before we had even picked our dates <p> I said , well ok I guess this is happening ! , and booked my flights too <p> We reserved a rental car for 5 days <p> We exchanged messages the week before , deciding we definitely wanted to do Wineglass Bay , the east coast beaches , and the Tamar Valley vineyards <p> I downloaded the WikiCamps app on my iPhone while waiting for Teresa at the Hobart airport ( since we had zero accommodation booked and would be camping most nights , I figured this would be good to find nearby campsites on the fly ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going when we hopped into our rental car . <p> This was our makeshift kitchen one night . Camping is SO glamorous ! <p> But you know what ? It felt really great to have total freedom over our 5 days roadtripping around Tasmania . We never felt the pressure of having to be at a certain place at a certain time . Each morning we 'd wake up and see what we felt like doing before deciding where to drive to . It was laidback and spontaneous and just so much fun ! <p> We ultimately ended up doing a counterclockwise route around eastern Tasmania . 5 days felt like just the right amount of time for it ! <h> Day 1 : Richmond &amp; Coal River Valley <p> Located a mere 20 minute drive north of Hobart International Airport , historic Richmond makes for a no-brainer stop on any Tasmania roadtrip . We rolled through town expecting more town , you might say . Richmond 's got more of a village feel to it , though , so I 'd recommend parking your car and wandering through on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the Convict Bridge first . Technically ( and unoriginally ) , it 's called the Richmond Bridge but it was built by convicts in 1825 and is the oldest bridge still in use in Australia . You could easily wile away an afternoon in Richmond by touring the Richmond Gaol ( jail ) or navigating the Richmond Maze ( a lifesize outdoor timber maze ) . Side note : Richmond , what 's with the names of all your tourist attractions ? #snoozefest <p> The roads leading to/from Richmond are dotted with vineyard signs , enticing you to sample wines from the Coal River Valley region . Teresa and I were deadset on getting our wine touring on in the Tamar Valley later in our Tasmania roadtrip , but being fresh off the plane and not having any concrete plans for our 5 days in Tasmania , we had no reason NOT to stop for some wine early on Day 1 . Puddle Duck Vineyard does a stellar Pinot Noir ; I was n't overly impressed with their famous sparkling Bubbleduck , however . <p> Vineyards and cellar doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time we made the executive decision to head toward the east coast and hit Freycinet National Park the next morning . We did n't anticipate all the campgrounds in the area being fully booked out in advance , though , which sent us into a last minute scramble to find affordable accommodation outside of Coles Bay and Swansea . By some stroke of luck , we nabbed the last free campsite at the holiday park in Bicheno . Still , I highly recommend booking ahead for accommodation near Freycinet National Park , as it 's a very popular region with limited options for affordable places to stay . <h> Day 2 : Freycinet National Park <p> We only spent a morning at Freycinet National Park , but if I could go back and do it again I 'd devote at least a full day to this glorious place . <p> First thing 's first : hitting the Wineglass Bay lookout as early in the day as possible . You definitely want to go before 10am to avoid the crowds and tour groups . Ironically , we arrived at 9am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds cleared which of course was well after loads more people arrived . Ah well ! ' t was still a beautiful sight well worth the wait and crowd . <p> From the Wineglass Bay lookout ( 1-1.5 hours return from carpark ) , you can hike down to the beach and back ( 2-3 hours return from the carpark ) , or continue hiking in a loop that takes you through both Wineglass Bay and Hazards Bay ( 4-5 hours , 11km loop ) . Had we not killed the whole morning driving and waiting for the sun to come out ( and , let 's be real , if we had n't needed to use the bathroom so badly ) , we 'd have been keen to do more hiking from Wineglass Bay , but instead we went straight back to the carpark . <p> Before we bid adieu to Freycinet , we made a couple of stops at some lookout points at Thouin Bay on the east coast of the park . This turned out to be a great move because WHOA is the Freycinet coast stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock that pops up all along Tasmania 's east coast ( especially in the Bay of Fires further north ) . Super beautiful , and does n't require much time to see , so do n't miss it ! <p> Later in the day , we started heading up the coast toward the Bay of Fires and stopped for the night to camp ( for free ! ) at Dora Point , just near Binalong Bay . And so began a very windy weather pattern that would haunt us for the rest of our time in Tasmania ! <h> Day 3 : Bay of Fires <p> I have to say , Tasmania really surprised us with its stunning east coast beaches . With their white sand and azure waters , they looked like they were straight out of the Caribbean ( minus some palm trees , of course no palms in Tassie ! ) . And best of all , even during summer we were practically the only ones on any of these beaches . <p> Peron Dunes <p> Binalong Bay is arguably the stunner here . The beach itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the orange rocks scattered on the perimeter even more . I automatically associate that orange and blue combo with Australia as a whole ( I mean hellooooooo , the Outback ! ) . <p> But oh my gosh , the wind on Tasmania 's east coast is INSANE . Between the wind and the perpetually cold water , Tasmania 's beaches are not exactly fit for swimming at any time of year . Binalong Bay was so windy we could only manage to stay on the beach for a few minutes in our hoodies and cropped pants before running back to the car for shelter . <p> A bit further up the coast , we stopped off at a couple random beaches , sat in the sun and sand , and had ourselves a little picnic lunch . Tasmanian beaches are seriously gorgeous ! <p> Cosy Corner Beach <p> Finally we made our way to the Bay of Fires , which has the highest concentration of those orange rocks in Tasmania . My google-fu has ascertained that the orange color on the granite rocks comes from lichen . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frolic . <p> By late afternoon , we headed inland toward the north-central coast , intending to get as close to the Tamar Valley as possible so that we could wake up the next morning and get right into the wine tasting . We did n't quite make the 5pm close time at the vineyards we passed en route , but Teresa found something even better for us to do on the fly : stop for some cheese tasting at Pyengana Dairy Company . We emerged with a large chunk of their creamy cheddar cheese easily some of the best cheese I 've ever enjoyed . <p> Low Head , Tasmania <p> Around 6pm we reached Low Head , a small town on the mouth of the Tamar River , right on the northern coast of Tasmania . We figured it would be a good launching point for the next day 's wine tasting extravaganza , and enthusiastically went to pitch our tent at the tourist park there . What we had n't counted on , however , was the ridiculous heavy winds that whipped through town 24/7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that camping in a wind tunnel was not on our list of things to do on this Tasmania roadtrip . It actually worked out well because we were able to upgrade our accommodation there and stay in an old trailer that had been converted into an 8-bed dorm , with a couple of older folks who were in town for the folk festival . <p> Seriously though Low Head has got to be one of the windiest towns in the world . I opened my car door once and one of our maps flew out into the windy vortex , never to be seen again . <h> Day 4 : Tamar Valley &amp; Launceston <p> Wine tasting in Tamar Valley is a must-do on any Tasmania roadtrip . The wine route is very clearly marked along the roads surrounding the Tamar River , making it very easy to just drive around the area without a plan and stop at any of the 32 vineyards that sparks your attention . Here are the 6 that we somewhat randomly visited : <p> Holm Oak Vineyards <p> Goaty Hill Wines ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Moores Hill ( we had a great cheese platter here ) <p> Marion 's Vineyard ( owned by a quirky American hippie ! ) <p> Tamar Ridge ( super professional and mega award-winning ) <p> Velo Vineyard <p> The Tamar Valley in Tasmania is known for its exceptional Pinot Noir , so if you 're going to try anything go for that . I also found the Chardonnay to be consistently great at each vineyard we visited . <p> I 've got ta hand it to my roadtrip partner-in-crime , Teresa : not only did she drive my ass around for 5 days , but she also eagery sampled wine at 6 different vineyards with utmost discipline ( i.e. she did n't actually swallow most of what she tasted , and only took a few sips of each since she was driving ) . I hardly made it through Vineyard #4 before I felt like calling it quits on the vino . <p> The Tamar Valley vineyards have this cool program where you can pick up a cardboard box at your first vineyard , fill it up with your purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship the box home to you . Teresa had a box of all her favorite Tassie wines shipped to her house in Toowoomba . Since I was traveling and had no extra money to spend , I could n't really justify buying any bottles to take home with me , but man if I 'd had a more stable work and living situation , I 'd have been all over this ! <p> With its close proximity to the Tamar Valley , Launceston makes for a sensible stop along the way or even a place to base yourself for a night . We did n't  stop at Tasmanias second-largest city during our roadtrip , but I returned before hiking the Overland Track and paid a visit to Cataract Gorge . I highly recommend it on a hot summer day , specifically for the cliff jumping and swimming . There are also some short hikes you could do there , should you fancy that . <p> Instead of visiting or staying overnight in Launceston , we opted to do some berry picking at the nearby Hillwood Berry Farm . We walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspberries I 've ever eaten in my life ! ( I did not , however , walk out with my credit card which I realized a half hour later when I went to pay for fuel . Oops ! ) <p> That evening , we drove south towards Hobart with the intention of kicking off the next morning hiking at one of the inland national parks . We camped for free at some random parking lot in a tiny town whose name I ca n't recall , about an hour northwest of Hobart ( thank you , WikiCamps ! ) . <h> Day 5 : Tasman Peninsula <p> On our last day , we made a gametime decision to head south of Hobart to explore the Tasman Peninsula rather than hike at a nearby park . This turned out to be an excellent choice because WOW is this coastline beautiful . There are several touristy stops you can make when you first enter the peninsula , most of which are collapsed caves , blowholes , and other rock formations , all swarmed by Asian tourists and/or local families . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We snuck a peek at this old convict site through the fences , but opted for a hit of natural scenery instead of shelling out what we felt was a bit too much money on admission here . I 've heard great things about Port Arthur though , so it 's definitely worth a stop on your Tasmania roadtrip if you 're into history and open air museums . <p> We continued driving into Tasman National Park , and that 's where things got really good . This park is chock full of coastal walks , ranging from an hour to several days long . I 'm already contemplating a return trip later this year once the Three Capes Track opens in November ! <p> But this time around , we just had a taste of the park via scenic lookouts and short walks from the carpark . I recommend checking out the Remarkable Cave and exploring the coast nearby . <p> If you 've got a few hours to spare on the Tasman Peninsula , definitely high tail it to Cape Raoul . There are a couple different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike to Cape Raoul ( 5 hours return ) or the hike to the Cape Raoul lookout ( 1.5 hours return ) . Youre allowed to camp on the field just by the carpark , so if you 've got the time I 'd say camp here for a night and do one hike the first day and another hike the second day . <p> We did the short hike to the lookout . These ridicuous coastal views left me begging for more ! 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Amazing photos , Lindsay .

@@118792693 @7792693/ <h> The 7 Best Weekend Trips From Sydney <p> In my very biased opinion , the best way to spend a weekend in Sydney is at the beach . Kick back on a sheltered Sydney Harbour beach or battle the waves on an ocean beach either way , no need to leave the city to have a kick arse weekend . <p> But of course I 'm all for outdoor adventures and exploration . And with beaches , mountains , and valleys all within 2-3 hours from the city , there are plenty of options for fun weekend trips from Sydney . Here are some of the best adventures to be had in New South Wales , all within a few hours from the big city : <h> 1 . The Northern Beaches <p> If you 're over Sydney 's city beaches ( a notion my beach bummin ' self can not comprehend ) , consider heading north to a new stretch of sand . From Manly up to Palm Beach you 'll find Sydney 's famed Northern Beaches no less than 23 of them , in fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns comprised more of affluent families than tourists each one with its own beach or three . <p> For a relaxed and/or romantic getaway from Sydney , book an Airbnb for a weekend in one of the northern beach towns and base yourself there as you beach hop . Or for a slightly more adventurous outing , consider camping at Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park . <p> How to get there : 1-2 hour drive or 2 hour bus ride from Sydney CBD <h> 2 . Jervis Bay <p> Just a 3 hour drive south of Sydney ( and sadly disconnected from any effective public transport ) lies Jervis Bay , home of some of Aussie 's most legendary white sand beaches . Kite surfing and kangaroos are rampant here , but you ca n't go wrong just sticking your toes in sand so fine it squeaks when you walk on it . <p> What surprised me the most about Jervis Bay was how it 's more of a town than a beach a woodsy town with winding roads that may or may not lead you to the bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ) day , but it tends to get cloudy and windy by the afternoon so it 's better to plan for some morning beach time if possible ( and hence an overnight trip ) . The national park offers some excellent campsites . <p> How to get there : 3 hour drive south from Sydney <h> 3 . Royal National Park <p> If it 's outdoor adventures and dramatic coastal views you seek , Royal National Park is your jam . To fully appreciate this gorgeous region , you should tackle the 26km ( 2 day ) coastal track it 'll spoil you with endless views of the eastern Aussie coast dotted with beautiful beaches , creeks , and waterfalls . You 'll have to carry all your camping gear and food the whole way , but it 's worth it ! <p> Alternatively , you could opt for the day trip route and hire a car for a day , stopping off throughout the park to enjoy viewpoints and short walks . ( Recommended : North Era Beach , Mermaid Pool ) <p> How to get there : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the train back from Otford . Otherwise , Bundeena is an hour drive south from Sydney . <h> 4 . Kangaroo Valley <p> For a relaxing retreat , head down to Kangaroo Valley and immerse yourself in nature . This trip is best done by renting a car for a weekend and staying at a B&amp;B that has enough amenities and beautiful landscapes to make you forget all about the stresses of city life , though you could also camp on the river ( I 've done both and surprisingly recommend the former ) . Should you catch the itch to explore Kangaroo Valley , you could chase waterfalls on the scenic loop , go wine tasting , or rent a boat and canoe down the Kangaroo River . <p> How to get there : 2 hour drive south of Sydney <h> 5 . Blue Mountains <p> The Blue Mountains are about the easiest day trip you can make from Sydney : simply hop on a train and arrive at Katoomba 2 hours later . From here , you can access viewpoints and hiking trails sans vehicle , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more options here . <p> While in the Blue Mountains , be sure to check out the famous Three Sisters and ride the world 's steepest railway , If you 've got more than an afternoon , consider booking a rock climbing or abseiling trip ( recommended : High and Wild ) or embarking on an overnight trek . The Blue Mountains are best done on a camping trip with ample time for outdoor adventuring , but can also be enjoyed on a day trip if that 's all you can manage . <p> How to get there : 2 hour train ride or 1.5 hour drive from Sydney <h> 6 . Hunter Valley <p> Wine tasting is the name of the game in The Hunter . Unless you 're able to wrangle yourself a DD , you 'll want to book a spot on a day tour from Sydney . Either way , you 'll have yourself a delightfully tipsy day sampling New South Wales ' finest wines ( semillon is a must ) while enjoying the gorgeous vineyard landscapes along the way . <p> How to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive about 2 hours north and explore the vineyards independently . <h> 7 . The Hawkesbury River <p> I 've yet to cross this hidden gem off my Sydney weekend trip list , but all signs Ive seen point toward the Hawkesbury being a worthy weekend getaway . If you go with a group of friends or family , rent a houseboat its definitely the thing to do on the river . <p> Otherwise , there 's loads more outdoor adventures to be had on the Hawkesbury : kayaking , fishing , tubing , bushwalking , swimming , and more . <p> How to get there : 1 hour drive northwest of Sydney <h> Which is your pick for the best weekend trip from Sydney ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Nelson Bay is also nice but my favourites are Jervis Bay and the Blue Mountains : ) 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> AHH , looks like this list needs to expand from 7 options !

After logging 8+ hours hiking in flip flops , 14+ hours in various modes of transport , and one of the nastiest sunburns of my life , can you blame me for just wanting to take it easy for the 2 days we had in this city ? <p> Oh yeah , we were kickin it in colorful Cartagena , Colombia ! <h> Old Town Cartagena <p> Cartagena is a sizable city ; of typical interest to visitors are the Old Town ( aka the Old City , or Walled City ) and Bocagrande ( the peninsula where high rise hotels , restaurants , clubs , and shops can be found ) . Of sole interest to us was the former , Old Town Cartagena . <p> Cartagenas Old Town certainly has enough aesthetics to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorways and balconies . We lugged our professional cameras and lenses around everywhere , even waking up at 6am one morning to shoot the town before it woke up . I just couldnt get over the vibrant colors everywhere . Colors for days ! <p> After a cumulative day and a half of roaming the colorful streets , we had another half day to " kill " in Cartagena before leaving for the airport . Recovering from our Tayrona sunburns and not having nearly enough time for an excursion out of town , we racked our heads for a more sensible option . <p> " I know there 's supposed to be an amphitheatre here somewhere I saw it when I google image searched for Cartagena ! " , I insisted . Nicki tried to find information about it on her phone while we were out and about but to no avail . In all our Old Town frolicking , youd think we 'd have stumbled across it at some point , no ? <p> Well , we googled it later on turns out there 's an amphitheatre in Cartagena , SPAIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could stand to get a little better at my fact checking . <p> We chose the Colombian coast for our winter getaway in part because it promised sunshine and heat . These things it undoubtedly delivered overdelivered , even . We contentedly found our rhythm walking around town in the sun for a couple hours , then retreating to the shade for a cold drink or snack . Fresh fruit , smoothies , and empanadas always seem to be within reach wherever you are in town . <h> Where we drank : El Balcon <p> Forever a sucker for balconies , I was immediately drawn to El Balcon on Plaza de San Diego . We shared hummus and red wine on a balcony overlooking the square , and all felt right in the world . That is , until a tour group of old folks rolled in , at which point we picked up the pace with our wine consumption . Thumbs up to traveling at ANY age , of course but were forever champions of independent travel . That 's just how we roll . <h> Where we ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs up , its got ta be worth trying , right ? La Cevicheria is an Old Town culinary gem , specializing in seafood . We did n't  try the ceviche ( cubed fresh raw fish with citrus juices and spices ) , but their catch of the day on a plate of coconut rice was probably the best fish dish I 've had in my life . Wed wanted an outdoor table , but the restaurant interior was cute enough that we did n't  really mind dining inside . <h> Where we stayed : El Genoves Hostal <p> We did n't  put much thought into our Cartagena accommodation beyond a preference for somewhere cheap in the Old Town , so we were pleasantly surprised at how awesome- El Genoves Hostal turned out to be . Chill , authentic , and just 30,500 COP ( $15 US ) a night El Genoves did n't  even feel like a hostel , but more like a calm little nook to retreat to at the end of the day . Highly recommended ! <h> The Walled City <p> At one point Cartagena was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches to Spain . During the colonial period , a wall was built to protect it from pirates pillaging . <p> Today , you can walk the entire 4km wall around town and snag views of the sea and the streets from above just beware of the guys hawking souvenirs and the young couples making out all along the wall ! <h> What else can you do in Cartagena ? <p> We were content just strolling around town , but there 's plenty more to do in or just outside of Cartagena proper : <p> El Totumo A mud volcano where you can float around and get massaged in the mud , then scrubbed down afterwards . You 'll want to budget a half day for this . <p> Playa Blanca The best beach near Cartagena is just an hour boat ride away . Its typically crowded with daytrippers and best enjoyed if you spend the night on the island . <p> Castillo San Felipe The Spanish built this fort to protect the city from pirates .

@@118792696 @7792696/ <h> 12 Must-Dos on a Kauai Road Trip <p> I recently wrote a post about how to plan a Kauai road trip you know , the practical stuff like where to get camping equipment , how to book campsites , and what kind of car to rent . <p> But let 's be real , that 's not super exciting unless you 're actively planning a Hawaii trip . I 'm willing to bet most of you just want to see some beautiful photos of Kauai and maybe find out what you can actually see and do on the island . So let 's get into it ! <p> First , just one quick logistical note : you 'll fly into Lihue , which is almost exactly in the center of your driving route . There is no road that covers the west coast , so you 'll have to backtrack to get between the northwest and southwest regions of the island . And lest you think you can get away with skipping either end of the road , think again : 2 of the must-dos on this list can be found just off of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in about 2 hours . <p> Alright , here we go : here are 12 of what I consider to be must-do activities on a Kauai road trip ! <p> Sunset on Poipu Beach . <p> Camping on Haena Beach . <h> 1 . Camp On The Beach <p> One of my very favorite things about Kauai is how- most of its campsites are in beach parks i.e. right on the beach . You ca n't pitch your tents- on the sand , but you can set them up right along it and still enjoy views of the sea . Does it get any better than falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing ? Not in my world ! <p> All of the Kauai county campsites are located on the beach and cost $3/night per person . I especially enjoyed camping at Salt Pond Beach Park on the south coast : it was wonderful waking up just after sunrise and going for an early morning dip in the ( surprisingly warm and calm ) water . <p> Salt Pond State Park . <p> The one Kauai state park with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a- camping experience you do n't  want to miss . You can pitch your tent in the sand dunes here and then sit out and watch the sunset over the- ocean . It is MAGICAL . <h> 2 . Walk Along The South Coast <p> In terms of offbeat adventures in Kauai , there 's a segment of the south coast- just east of the Grand Hyatt that 's brilliant for walks and hardly anyone knows about it . <p> We had a bit of trouble finding access , but your best bet is to drive to the eastern end of Poipu Road , take a right at the fork ( the left road should be gated off ) , and then take the next left at the fork away from the stables . If you search for Makauwahi Cave Trail on Google Maps , that should take you to a good starting point . <p> From here , you can either head right ( west ) toward the Hyatt and walk along the cliffs on the Mahaulepu Heritage Trail , or left ( east ) to traverse some beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaches/blowholes route and I believe we went as far east as Kamala Point . <p> Kauai is n't really known for its coastal walks , but I 'd definitely recommend checking this stretch of coastline out for the incredible landscapes you 'll traverse . <h> 3 . Eat Acai Bowls , Poke Bowls , &amp; Shave Ice <p> ( And also the fish tacos from Tiki Tacos because they are AH-MA-ZING . But , you know , Kauai is n't exactly known for its tacos , so Ill just leave it at that . ) <p> These are n't  specific to Kauai , so you can find them on most any of the Hawaiian islands but since were going with the assumption that you 're embarking on a Kauai road trip , let 's look at the best options for finding all three of them on this particular island : <h> Acai Bowls <p> Hawaii is a fantastic place to sample acai bowls and smoothie bowls because of all the local- fruit available on the islands and their focus on fresh organic ingredients . On Kauai , I had the best ( and most filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a really delicious green smoothie bowl at- Little Fish Coffee , both of which are on the south side of the island . <p> Smoothie bowls in Kauai . <h> Poke Bowls <p> A poke bowl ( pronounced poh-keh ) is cubed fish mixed with veggies and various seasonings , served over rice . A bit like deconstructed sushi , if you will . <p> Its typically sold across Hawaii in markets and supermarkets as a sort of fast food / takeaway dish , less so- as an item on a restaurant menu . On Kauai , some of the best poke can be found at Koloa Fish Market and Pono Market . Honestly , just pick any place listed on the first page of Yelp they all have stellar reviews . <h> Shave Ice <p> I 'm not into sugary things , so I opted out of sampling this Hawaiian treat ( I know , I 'm the worst ) . But for all of you more normal folks , definitely try the shave ice in Kauai . Its similar to a snow cone and does in fact look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the ice is shaved , not crushed . Apparently this is- better for absorbing the syrups and flavors added on top . And because its Hawaii , there are- plenty of shave ice options with local ingredients used to flavor the ice and possibly even some vanilla ice cream at the bottom of the cup for extra awesome . <p> I cant speak from experience , but my sources tell me that some of the best shave ice in Kauai can be found at JoJos Shave Ice- and Ono Ono Shave Ice . Anna tried one at Wishing Well in Hanalei and was very underwhelmed . <p> Wailua Falls . <h> 4 . Chase Some Waterfalls <p> You ca n't travel to Kauai and- not chase waterfalls . The Garden Isle is absolutely brimming with- them , so itd be wrong not to pay a visit to at least a few . <p> Our waterfall adventures included glimpsing THE BRIGHTEST RAINBOW EVER form over a waterfall in Waimea Canyon , spotting a whole bunch of very-tall falls in the mountains- from our helicopter tour , stopping off the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls . There are loads of others , too just order a copy of The Ultimate Kauai Guide Book and have it on hand to refer to when youre craving some waterfall action during your Kauai road trip . <p> Hoopii Falls . <h> 5 . Take a Kauai Helicopter Tour <p> If ever there was a place- to splurge on a scenic helicopter flight , - Kauai is it . <p> Helicopter tours are *the thing* to do on Kauai , and after experiencing one for myself there I- completely understand why . There is so much gobsmackingly stunning scenery on the island that is n't easy accessible by foot or car , such as all the massive waterfalls in the jungle and the- famous- Na Pali Coast on Kauais west side . What 's more , exploring the island by helicopter as opposed to a plane is well worth the extra money because helicopters can get you up close to the sights as they are far easier to- maneuver than planes are . <h> 6 . Snorkel With Sea- Turtles <p> I- had every intention of snorkeling with turtles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I even purchased a snorkel set from Walmart the day we landed on the island . But sadly it just did n't  happen . Do n't  make the same mistake that- I did ! Snorkeling with turtles in Kauai is- absolutely a must-do . <p> Note that the time of year you visit may dictate where you end up snorkeling . During winter the north shore is too rough , so you 'll want to snorkel off the south coast . The best places to snorkel in Kauai in winter are Poipu in the south , or possibly Anini in the north as its a sheltered lagoon and less subject to rough surf . During summer , the north shore is much calmer and has several great snorkeling spots : Kee Beach , Tunnels Beach , and Anini Beach , to name a few . <p> If you plan on snorkeling more than once on your Hawaii trip , its probably worth it to buy your own snorkel gear rather than rent it . Buy something like- this snorkel set- for your trip and you should be set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If for some reason you need a break from outdoor adventures , Kauais got several small towns that were just made for frolicking . <h> Hanapepe <p> Hanapepe is " Kauais biggest little town " - ( and proud of it , if the sign on the main road is any indication ! ) . We enjoyed the hell out of this cute little hamlet on the south coast , so much so that we stopped off- twice there . It kind of rides the line between ghost town and Stars Hollow ( fellow Gilmore Girls addicts , you know what I mean ) . I especially loved the old building facades that just scream photo shoot and oh yes , we obliged . <p> A shop in Hanapepe . <h> Kapaa <p> I really regret not having enough time to properly explore Kapaa because it looked absolutely ADORABLE . Most of the shop windows were adorned with fairy lights and Christmas decorations , and we basically wanted to check out every single one we drove by . <h> Hanalei Bay <p> Hanalei Bay is the north shores cutest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring boutiques and several fancy-like restaurants . But then its also got cheap shops- and food trucks to cater to frugal kids like us . If you 're in town on a Friday morning , definitely stop by the Hanalei Farmers Market . <p> The St. Regis on Hanalei Bay . <h> 8 . Splurge on a Fancy Beachfront Hotel <p> As I mentioned in my other Kauai Road Trip post , Ive become a massive fan of splurging in the middle of a road trip for a night or two in a ridiculously nice hotel . I find its an excellent way to rest up , clean off , and get ready for the next segment- of your camping adventure . <p> Kauais not short of nice hotels , but two in particular that I would wholeheartedly recommend are the St. Regis and the Grand Hyatt . The Hyatt is essentially- a family-friendly palace on the south coast , while the St. Regis is a classy couples-friendly resort on the north shore . <p> Know what my hands-down favorite part of our Kauai splurge experience was ? Rocking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album , tiny car full of dirty camping gear and- a half-inflated air mattress . half-drunk bottle of wine in the passenger- door pocket . The staff did n't  even bat an eye at the ridiculous scene we created and treated us with as much class and respect as they would any " normal " guest of theirs . <p> Second favorite part was hanging out by the hotel infinity pool , for sure . <h> 9 . Frolic on- the Beaches of the North Shore <p> Once again , I 'm going to call on my trusty pal , - The Ultimate Kauai Guide Book , for direction on this one . This book has photos and descriptions of EVERY SINGLE BEACH in Kauai , so you can essentially just flip through and see what looks good while you 're on the road , then drive right there . <p> Due to time constraints and piss-poor winter weather during our stint on the north shore , we did n't  get to sample many of the beaches up there . In general though , the north shore beaches are beautiful , blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for snorkeling . You 're gon na want to spend at least one sunny day enjoying some of them . <p> Lumahai Beach is completely gorgeous , and best known as the beach seen in South Pacific . <p> Kee Beach is all the way at the end of the road ( by the Kalalau trailhead ) and has a reef that allows for- great snorkeling ops and a sheltered swimming area . <p> Secret Beach offers golden sand , a waterfall , and often dolphin sightings in summer . <p> Kee Beach . <h> 10 . Hike the Kalalau Trail <p> Warning : this ones only for experienced and confident hikers ! <p> The Kalalau Trail is nothing short of epic . How can it be anything else , really , when its known for being one of the most dangerous and beautiful treks in the world ? Over the course of 11 miles , you 'll make your way along the stunning Na Pali coast to Kalalau Beach , trudging through mud and tip toeing along cliff edges , pausing often to lift your jaw up off the ground because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're into multi-day treks , you 100% need to tackle the Kalalau Trail . Be sure- to allot at least a few days of your Kauai trip to this hike and book your permit ahead of time . If you 're short on time , cant get a permit , or do n't  feel comfortable hiking the whole trail , consider hiking just the first 2 miles of it to- Hanakapi'ai and back . <p> Click the link below to read more details on prepping and taking on the Kalalau Trail . <h> 11 . Explore- Waimea Canyon &amp;- Kokee State Park <p> Waimea Canyon is often referred to as " the Grand Canyon of the Pacific " aka YOU MUST GO HERE . Its really freakin beautiful , even on a dreary day like the one we were not-so-blessed with during our visit . <p> Take Waimea Canyon Road up from the south coast and you 'll pass through Waimea Canyon State Park , then- Kokee State Park . Both are absolutely rife with hiking trails and lookout points. - Definitely head all the way to the top to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Again , use- The Ultimate Kauai Guide Book- as your Kauai bible : it does a fantastic job at outlining all of the hiking and viewpoint-hopping options in the parks so that you can narrow it down to your must-dos . Had I had more time at Waimea , the Honopu Ridge Trail ( 5 hours return ) would have been my day hike of choice . And had I not taken on the Kalalau Trail , I 'd have done one of the multi-day hikes down into Waimea Canyon ( where I 've heard you can camp near- waterfalls ) . <p> Kalalau lookout. <h> 12 . Surf or Stand Up Paddleboard in Hanalei Bay <p> Hanalei Bay is n't just the picture-perfect cove on which- celebrities own lavish- homes ; its also a damn fine spot to mount a surfboard for the first time , thanks to the excellent small- wave action . <p> You can learn how to surf in Kauai with- Hanalei Surf School- at $75 for a 1.5 hour lesson , or Hawaiian Surfing Adventures at- $65 for a 1.5 hour lesson . Alternatively , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from either company and take them out into the bay yourself . <p> Hanalei Bay . <h> What else would you say is a must-do on a Kauai road trip ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Katie Bell <p> Ah you have taken me back to my own trip to Kauai . I loved Hanapepe too and stopped off there a couple of times . I stayed in Kapaa and it really is a cute little town its actually the biggest town on the island or so I was told although you would n't know it . <p> Yeah I heard that Kapaa is the biggest town on Kauai ! I remember thinking whaaaaat , no way , when we drove through it . Really wish I 'd had more time to spend there , it looks adorable ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

He regaled me with photos from his hometown : Annecy , France . " The Venice of the Alps " , he claimed . I was naturally skeptical , but after seeing just a few thumbnails on his iPhone I was floored .

On Wednesdays ( maybe every week , maybe not ) I 'll share a few of the most beautiful photos I can find of a place I 'm just aching to visit someday . <p> Have you ever even heard of Annecy ?

Like Geneva , it sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has canals winding through its Old Town . <p> Just looking at pictures of Annecy , I see other beautiful cities within this one town : pastel-colored facades like in Cartagena ; bike-lined canals like in Amsterdam ; a glowing blue lake amidst the mountains like in New Zealand . And if the ridiculous scenery is n't enough to lure you , how about the abundance of outdoor activities on offer ? Paragliding , dogsledding , and boating , just to name a few . <p> Its long been a mystery to me why Ive yet to visit France , especially after 6 trips to Europe and with my recent discovery of Annecy , I 'd say its jumped in the rankings on my ( hypothetical ) bucket list . 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Wonderful photos , Lindsay !

@@118792698 @7792698/ <h> Jungle Beach : When Tour Groups Attack <p> You know the feeling of having discovered something so incredible and special that you wonder how on earth others have n't found out about it yet ? And then finally they do find out about it , and it " sells out " and no longer has that charm that captivated you in the first place ? <p> That 's what 's happened with my favorite coffee shop in Brooklyn : Cafe Grumpy . Ever since I moved to NYC 5.5 years ago , that place has been my jam . Now that it 's been featured on the hit show Girls ' ( which I absolutely LOVE and can not hate on here ) , it 's blown up . Good luck finding a seat on weekends . Also , the price for a plain ol ' cup of brewed coffee has gone up by $1 in the past year . My favorite cafe is just not the same anymore , and I 'm not ready to accept that . <p> I think the same thing has happened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idyllic private beach that only a select few in the world would ever come to know .

But something was missing . It just did n't feel special . <p> I blame it on Lonely Planet . Now that Jungle Beach Resort has been featured in their guidebooks , people are finding out about it and fast . And just to clarify , I was NOT one of these people : Rough Guide was my guidebook of choice , and I found out about the place thanks to Christine 's blog post on Jungle Beach : ) <p> I visited in the shoulder season , so there were only a handful of other people there when I arrived . But then the next morning , a massive tour group descended on Jungle Beach and took over the whole resort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-somethings . For the most part , they were respectful and cool but it killed the ambience for me . If I had wanted a tour group experience , I would have signed up for one . <p> One good thing came out of it , though . At least half of the group were Canadians and as a result , I can now officially discern the Canadian accent from the American accent . The secret ? Listen to the way they say about ' it 'll sound more like ABOAT . And the funny thing is , when I pointed this out to a few Canadians I met while in Asia , they were all indignant and insisted they did n't say it like that . Except they DID every single one of them ! <h> What I Disliked About Jungle Beach <p> Its kind of expensive $30/night is a far cry from what you 'll typically spend elsewhere in Vietnam on budget accommodation , but when you factor in the all-inclusive aspect its not as unreasonable . <p> Its a hassle to get to In a way , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming here . But it does require a significant investment of time and money to get to Jungle Beach . <p> Too many people know about it now Jungle Beach is no longer Vietnams best-kept secret . Sadface . <h> What I Liked About Jungle Beach <p> I 'm not trying to discourage anyone from visiting Jungle Beach honest ! Though my experience was slightly lackluster , there were certainly some great things about it : <p> The food For breakfast , you can choose between a few different options on the menu and order whenever you wake up ( Tip : go with the fruit pancake or french toast AMAZING ! ) . Lunch and dinner are served at set times , communal-style . There were always several dishes to try , and they were usually quite delicious . Sometimes it felt like there was n't enough food , other times it felt like there was too much ! <p> Free lemon water It was nice not to have to buy my own bottled water every day . At Jungle Beach , you can help yourself to as much lemon water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jungle Beach was made for frolicking ! Every day I walked the entire length of the beach on smooth sands , which made for a great escape from the tour group . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of May 2013 <p> Accommodation : A bungalow at Jungle Beach is $30/night and includes all meals plus unlimited water . Coffee and alcohol are extra . <p> Getting There : There are no direct buses to Jungle Beach . The closest you can get by public transport is taking a bus on the Nha Trang Hoi An route and asking to be let off at the Doc Let petrol station . From there , you 'll have to take a moto to the beach ( about 30 minutes further ) . <p> Alternatively , you could just take a taxi/moto direct from Nha Trang to Jungle Beach , though its a long and expensive ride ! I paid 200,000 VND ( $9.50 US ) , though this was WAY below the asking price . <p> Leaving There : Jungle Beach staff can reserve a seat on the bus for you and arrange a pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest petrol station and wait with you there until your bus comes . The motorbike trip to the main road is a fixed 125,000 VND ( $6 US ) , and a seat on the sleeper bus from Doc Let to Hoi An was 250,000 VND ( $12 US ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Shannon Buckley <p> cmon , you never picked up on the whole " about " vs. " aboot " / " aboat " thing from watching HIMYM ? ! ; ) 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> See , I always thought it was aboot but how often am I around Canadians enough to pick up on it ?

One guy had been living there for MONTHS . By the time the tour group hit , it was just him , me , and one other guy at the resort . <p> I think it would have been fine without the tour group , since May is not exactly super busy , tourism-wise , in Vietnam . I did hear , though , that Jungle Beach Resort turns away a lot of people during the high season because its become so popular . Prices seem to have gone up significantly in recent years as well .

@@118792699 @7792699/ <h> Highlights From A Great Ocean Road Trip <p> I 'm usually skeptical about things that are uber-popular , but after a good long while of being stubborn I often come around and jump on that bandwagon . Like when I started watching Friends during the 10th and final season , and started reading the Harry Potter books right before Book 7 came out . How silly is it that I was needlessly hating on what are now two of my most loved creations in the entertainment world ? ! <p> I 'm like that when I travel as well . I thought I 'd hate the overpriced and overhyped Blue Lagoon when I traveled around Iceland last year , but I freaking LOVED it . Its the same idea : sometimes things are popular because they actually are super awesome . I need to get better about subduing the hipster in me and just turn off my auto-hate mode ! <p> Somehow , though , my normal rules never applied to the Great Ocean Road . I knew it was a land fraught with tour buses that inevitably carried tourists sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had to experience one of the worlds best road trips ! <p> After doing so twice last month , I can highly recommend taking on the devastatingly scenic Great Ocean Road . A few pro tips , if you do : <p> You 'll need a minimum of 2.5 days to make the roundtrip from Melbourne , but I 'd recommend 4 days/3 nights so you can take your time and spend more than a hot minute at each stop-off point . <p> Aim to travel during the week when there are far less tourists than on weekends trust me , the difference in crowds is MASSIVE . <p> Expect to be cold and bring your layers ! A sunny day can quickly turn to rain , and wind is pretty much guaranteed no matter what , so you 'll be glad to have a hat and a warm jacket . <p> Rent a room in a house on airbnb . I 'm always an advocate for camping , but the nights down here are COLD year round and well suited for indoor accommodation . You can find a room with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorm ! <p> Logistics aside , here 's what you can expect on a Great Ocean Road trip ( from east to west ) <h> The Surf Coast <p> The Great Ocean Road kicks off at Torquay , a proper beach town . We stopped here to pick up wine and coffee and had a picnic lunch by the beach , but there are plenty of restaurants and boutiques to enjoy here if you 're so inclined . <p> Torquay is also home to the famous Bells Beach , which hosts the annual Rip Curl Pro surfing competition maybe you 've heard of it ? There were bleachers assembled at the beach because , unbeknownst to us , the event had just wrapped about a week earlier . <p> You 'll enjoy the best coastal views along this segment of the road , from Torquay to Apollo Bay . Allow plenty of time to take it slow around those curves and enjoy the ridiculous scenery . There are also heaps of beaches to stop off at along the way . If your itinerary permits , you should definitely spend some time in Lorne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay . Wed have stayed here had we not prebooked a room in Apollo Bay . <p> OH OH OH , and you can see koalas in the wild here ! Look for the sign for Kennett River and turn off into the caravan park lot ( thank you , Lonely Planet tip ) . These cutie pies sleep some 22 hours a day , but we saw one wide awake chomping away on some leaves ( unfortunately it was too dark to get a decent photo ) . <h> The Otways <p> If you have limited time to do your Great Ocean Road Trip , I would n't prioritize the Otways as a must-do ; however , if you can swing it , it 's well worth the inland detour . Definitely budget some time for the Otways if you 're into rainforests and waterfalls . <p> Great Otway National Park expands inland from the coast and covers the bulk of the eastern half of the Great Ocean Road . In other words : if you turn off the Great Ocean Road at any point east of Cape Otway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are windy and hilly great fun to drive after dark with a clutch , let me tell you . During the day you 'll see nothing but insanely tall trees framing your path . We camped at a free campsite near Beauchamp Falls , and at night when we layed silent in bed , we could hear the gentle creaking of the trees swaying in the breeze . <p> If you have the luxury of both time and money , book some rainforest activities with Otway Fly Tree Top Adventures . Their famous Treetop Walk and Zip Line Tour are meant to be out-of-this-world awesome ! Otherwise , save your money and do some waterfall treks instead . <h> Port Campbell National Park <p> This is why you do the Great Ocean Road to see all of the good stuff inside this national park . All those photos you 've seen of arches , bridges , and various other rock structures in the water along a stunning coastline ? Yep , they were taken here ! <p> In order from east to west , here are the stops worth making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this is a thing , but it 's the first major stop in this region so everyone makes a point to stop off here . Yes , there are indeed steps leading down to a beach but the views do n't hold a candle to what lays ahead down the road . <h> The 12 Apostles <p> Really , is any caption needed here ? There are actually only 7 apostles now , so there 's that . <h> Loch Ard Gorge <p> I ca n't say enough good things about Loch Ard Gorge in fact , I 'm calling it as the best sight along the Great Ocean Road . There are a few walking paths you can take from the car park ; on my first Great Ocean Road trip , we only took the easternmost path , which led to some really spectacular coastal views and rock formations . <p> It was only after the fact that I realized we had n't actually seen the gorge itself ! I was sure to remedy this during my second roadtrip . Look at what I 'd missed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , either . An arch is an arch ( is an arch ) . <h> London Bridge <p> It used to be a bridge , until part of it collapsed and left a couple people marooned on the arch . I guess now it 's called London Arch ? <h> The Grotto <p> I 'd recommend hitting this spot earlier in the day , otherwise it 'll be covered in shadows . Still , it 's pretty cool walking down to watch the water in this little nook . <h> Bay of Islands Coastal Park <p> The sights and stop-offs after Port Campbell taper off abruptly , but there 's still plenty more coastline to see along the Bay of Islands if you 're not too jaded . <h> Bay of Martyrs <h> Bay of Islands <p> I 'd have liked to have seen this during daylight , but it was still gorgeous at dusk . Highly recommend making a stop here if you can ! 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of January 2015 <p> A 4 day car rental cost us AU$272 ( US$208 ) including insurance through Redspot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent about AU$90 ( US$69 ) total on petrol . <p> A double room in a house on airbnb can be had for as low as AU$44-54 ( US$34-41 ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792702 @7792702/ <h> Byron Bay : A Guide To This Aussie Beach Town <p> I recently spent 5 days in Byron Bay , a beautifully chilled out beach town in northern New South Wales with a decidedly SoCal vibe . I can report that its popularity is justified : Byron Bay now ranks as one of my favorite places in all of Australia . <p> In my opinion , Byron can be done in 3 days and ideally as more of a relaxation retreat than a sightseeing trip . Do n't  plan too much in advance , but rather see where each day takes you . <p> Below is a collection of places and activities in Byron Bay that I think you might love . My hope is that you 'll refer to this Byron Bay guide in the moment while you 're looking for something to do or somewhere to eat . <h> Where to Eat and Drink in Byron Bay <p> There are loads of cafes and restaurants in Byron ; these are the ones I sampled and loved : <p> Balcony This venue is gorgeous , classy , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . Balcony does fish , oysters , and cocktails exceedingly well , best enjoyed out on the wraparound balcony of course . My chef friend went nuts over the steak and Cabernet Merlot here . <p> In The Pink This shop has ridiculously good coconut gelato flavors , quite possibly the best I 've ever sampled . <p> Folk If you 're in need of some instagram fodder , go to Folk . This cafe is insanely cute and open-air , with seats on the patio , in the grass , and on a picnic blanket . Great coffee ( including the coconut cold brew ) , delicious breakfast dishes ( albeit with small-ish portions ) . I loved my chia seed porridge laced with warm apple cinnamon goodness . <p> The Top Shop A little outpost on a hill that does killer breakfast burgers and acai bowls . I went for the acai bowl with berries and cocoa nibs . <p> Bay Leaf This cafe does the best coffee in Byron Bay . If you 're a coffee snob with stamina , try the coffee tasting plate containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful open air space across two rooms , a bar , patio , and sidewalk it 's the kind of place you could easily wile away an afternoon , sitting in the sunshine and chatting with the super friendly staff . I tried both the lamb salad and avocado on sourdough and both were incredible . <p> Naked Treaties . <p> Naked Treaties Smoothies and smoothie bowls made with all raw ingredients ( some even include medicinal mushrooms ! ) are the jam at Naked Treaties . The *I Am Divine* smoothie bowl was well , divine . <p> 100 Mile Table - You do n't see this one pop up on many other *where to eat in Byron* lists , so let me clue you in on this secret spot . 100 Mile Table is located in the Arts and Industry Estate a few kilometers out of town ( a bit further out than Folk ) and it 's where the locals hang out . Everything is locally sourced ( hence the 100 mile ) and served in a modern industrial style cafe . The gluten free / dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And BONUS : its a great spot to sit with your laptop ( spacious long table + plentiful outlets = digital nomad heaven ) . <p> Treehouse on Belongil Treehouse is right across from the Belongil Beach parking lot and about a 20 minute walk from the town center , but do n't  let the location dissuade you : this is a fantastic lowkey spot to hang in the evening . Go there and order pizza for dinner , then stay and enjoy the live music that 's on most nights . <h> What to Do in Byron Bay <p> Hit the Beach Byrons blessed with 30km of beaches , every bit of it gloriously undeveloped and under-touristed . With most of the beaches facing north , you can watch the sunrise over the Cape Byron headland and the sunset over the hinterland . <p> Cape Byron sunset . <p> Cape Byron Walking Track This 3.7km loop is VERY worth doing . It takes you through rainforest , up to the Cape Byron Lighthouse and the eastern-most point of Australia , and back down along the coast . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yoga There are plenty of yoga studios to choose from in Byron . I loved the flow class I took with Geoff at Ananta Yoga . <p> Learn to Surf Surfing is THE thing to do in Byron Bay . Youll have no trouble finding a surf school or board rental shop around Byron ( alternatively : you can take a SUP lesson or rent a paddleboard ) . <p> Shopping Both thrift stores and beach chic boutiques are sprinkled around and outside of town . Even if you 're not in the market for pricey artisanal goods , some of the shop displays and homegoods are too pretty not to stop and gawk at for a second . <p> Daytrip to Nimbin Nimbin is where you go if you want to buy marijuana in any which form ( including cookies and cake ) or witness the hippie subculture . <p> Kayak With Dolphins This is one of the touristy must-dos in Byron , but well worth the effort if you 're eager to see some dolphins apparently they 're almost always around for these trips , so you 're unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate This area just north of town hosts numerous galleries , cafes , and shops and makes for a fun afternoon of offbeat exploring . <p> Festivals Byron Bay has some pretty well known music festivals which you may want to plan your trip around . Of note : Splendour in the Grass ( July ) , Byron Bay Bluesfest ( Easter ) , and Falls Festival ( New Years ) . Buy tickets well in advance and plan to camp . <h> Where to Stay in Byron Bay <p> Byron Beach Resort This is such an underrated gem for accommodation in Byron . Firstly , it offers a broad variety of accommodation options as a hostel/hotel hybrid , from dorm beds and budget rooms to en suite hotel rooms with a balcony and jet bath . It was especially ideal for me as I shared a private hotel room with a friend for 2 nights and then switched to the dorms once I was traveling solo . With hammocks hung all over the property , an onsite yoga studio , and free bikes to use , I was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Location-wise it 's a bit out of town , but it 's easily reached via a 20 minute walk down the beach ( or alternatively , the free shuttle ) . On the plus side , Belongil Beach is 2 minutes across the street , Treehouse at Belongil is nextdoor , and Folk is a quick bike ride away from town . <p> Byron Beach Resort . <p> The Arts Factory Universally beloved by backpackers , this hostel has an onsite pool and offers standard dorm rooms as well as beds in a teepee . It 's also situated right by the Byron Bay Brewery . The Germans I roadtripped with last year told me I absolutely had to stay at this Byron Bay hostel they loved it there so much that they ended up living there for several months ! So I 'd say if you 're really into the backpacker scene and keen to meet people , stay at the Arts Factory . <p> The Atlantic If you 've got money and style , stay at this new-ish boutique hotel .

@@118792703 @7792703/ <h> A Guide To Bouddi National Park <p> I originally came across Bouddi National Park on the Central Coast of New South Wales in my perpetual quest to find awesome outdoor adventures that are accessible without a car . Someday I 'll get comfortable driving in Australia and some year I 'll be able to afford a car . But for now , I 'm at the mercy of public transit and friends with motor vehicles , which I suppose is n't the worst problem to have , now is it ? <p> It may have taken me 3 months to pry myself away from the sensational beaches around my new home in Bondi , but I finally managed to venture further afield last week to explore this gloriously under-touristed pocket of nature . <p> As a disclaimer : yes , you can reach the campgrounds , beaches , and coastal walk in Bouddi National Park by public transport . However , it will take you multiple transfers between trains and buses ( and potentially ferries ) that you have to time exactly right if you want to reach Bouddi National Park from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ! <p> First , let 's talk about why Bouddi National Park makes for a fantastic weekend getaway from Sydney ( or weekday , if you 're self-employed like I am Monday camping trips for the win ! ) . <h> An Introduction To Bouddi National Park <p> The Central Coast of NSW spans about 30 miles of coastline between Sydney and Newcastle : specifically , from the mouth of the Hawkesbury River to the south end of Lake Macquarie . It tends to conjure up images of idyllic surf spots and peaceful beaches . <p> Bouddi National Park occupies the southernmost end of the Central Coast . If you want beachfront camping and coastal walks , this place is your jam . There are a few other trails in the park that run inland or to specific beaches from the main road , but the Bouddi Coastal Walk is the park 's crown jewel . You 'd be crazy to miss it ! <p> Tip : Download this map/brochure to get your bearings with all the beaches and trails available within Bouddi National Park . <h> Bouddi Coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The best stretch of the Bouddi Coastal Walk runs for 3km along the coast from Putty Beach to Maitland Bay . Putty Beach itself I found quite underwhelming and probably the least scenic of the 7 or so beaches within the national park , but one thing it does have going for it is the stellar view of the Barrenjoey Headland at Palm Beach . <p> Much of this trail segment is lined with boardwalk , making it a very easy walk between beaches . The first bit of it , up from Putty Beach , has some cool-looking rock to ogle and a patch of tessellated pavement . <p> Shortly after these rocks , there 's a sign marking the continuation of the coastal track to Maitland Bay , and a side trail to Bullimah- Beach . Do I even need to tell you to take the beach-bound track ? <p> You guys , this one 's now in the running for one of my favorite beaches near Sydney . When I first glimpsed these bright blue hues beyond the boardwalk , my face quickly morphed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sunny hours sunbathing there . <p> The sand at this beach is unlike any I 've seen elsewhere . It 's a coarse kind of sand , with teeny-tiny purple and white pebbles mixed in with golden sand . Too cool ! <p> Back on the Bouddi Coastal Walk , follow the trail uphill into the bush to reach Gerrin Point Lookout . The views from up here of the rocks below and the beaches in the distance are fabulous . <p> The rest of the trail from Gerrin Point to Maitland Bay is part-coastal walk and part-bushwalk . It 's a little less dramatic than the previous segment , but still pleasant and worth the effort to reach Maitland Bay Beach . <h> Maitland Bay to Little Beach ( 3.5km ) <p> Maitland Bay Beach feels like a little oasis , due to its seclusion . Access between Maitland Bay and the parking lot on the main road is via the very steep Maitland Bay Track ( 1km one-way ) . Golden sand and no crowds make this one a classic Aussie beach you should n't miss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2017 , the segment of trail from Maitland Bay to Little Beach was partially closed off to hikers so I ended up walking up the Maitland Bay Track and along The Scenic Road ( yep , that 's the name of the main road through the national park ) to the Little Beach Trail instead . It was doable , but quite hilly and lacking sidewalks on the main road . <p> If the Bouddi Coastal Walk is open between Little Beach and Maitland Bay when you 're there , you 'll walk across Maitland Bay Beach instead and continue along the trail rather than taking the Maitland Bay Track uphill . Just know that most of it does n't actually run along the coast so you 'll be in for more of a bushwalk than a coastal walk . <p> At Little Beach , you 'll find a few campsites as well as BBQ and picnic facilities for daytime use . This is also a great surf spot if the swell is cooperating . <p> Mourawaring Moor Trail . <h> Little Beach to Macmasters Beach ( 1.7km ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland rather than along the coast , but it 's still scenic and offers a couple of side trail options with beach views . <p> From Little Beach , cross the little creek and follow the trail uphill through the trees . Within minutes , you 'll find yourself walking on a sandy maintenance track called the Mourawaring Moor Trail . There are a couple of side tracks leading toward the coast that you can venture down if you have some time . This is what the Second Point Trail looks like : <p> Macmasters Beach from Second Point Trail . <p> The Mourawaring Moor Trail will soon deposit you onto Beachview Esplanade , a paved road . Walk a few minutes down the road and look for a dirt track between houses #51 and 53 this is the Macmasters Beach Walking Track , though it 's not labeled . <p> This trail leads into Macmaster Parade , though you 'll only be on it for a minute before you take the walking track around house #37 that leads down to Macmasters Beach . <p> Macmasters Beach is absolutely gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( by the Surf Lifesaving Club ) that 's particularly beautiful with the nearby headland reflecting on it . <h> Camping in Bouddi National Park <p> Bouddi is one of the few places in New South Wales that offers beachfront camping ( at least officially ) . These campsites book out far in advance on non-winter weekends , so be sure to reserve ahead of time if you 're planning a weekend camping trip . <p> Little Beach Campground- is the most ideally located of the three , I think , because you can walk toward Macmasters Beach in one direction or Putty Beach in the other . It 's open to day trippers during daylight hours , but come nightfall it 'll be quiet . There are bush toilets , picnic tables , and a BBQ . Campsites are $33/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <p> Note : I camped at Little Beach and walked to Macmasters Beach and back on Day 1 ; then on Day 2 , I packed up camp and hiked with all my gear from Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most family-friendly of the three , as you can easily drive and park right by your campsite . The sites are n't right on the beach , but are just a few minutes ' walk from it . This campground is the most built up in terms of facilities , offering flush toilets , an outdoor shower , and drinking water . Campsites are $33/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <p> Tallow Beach Campground- is the most remote of the three , requiring a 1.2km walk from the car park . It 's a bit inconvenient if you 're looking to do the coastal walk or other hikes within the national park , but ideal if all you want is to camp in seclusion near a beautiful beach . There 's nothing but a bush toilet here , so bring your own stove if you plan to cook . Campsites are $24/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <h> Getting to Bouddi National Park <p> Depending on where in Sydney you 're located , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park . The buses that operate around the park are quite infrequent though , so you 'll want to consult Google Maps or better yet the Opal transit app to plan your route . When I was looking to travel from Sydney to Little Beach , I found there was n't a way to get there on a Sunday hence my Monday excursion . <p> From Sydney Central Station , catch the train towards Newcastle and get off at either Woy Woy ( for Putty Beach ) or Gosford ( for Little Beach ) . <p> From Gosford to Little Beach , take the 64 to the 65 bus , get off near Namatjira Drive and then walk 25 minutes to the campground . <p> From Woy Woy to Putty Beach , take the 64 bus to the 59 bus , get off near Beach Drive and then walk 9 minutes to the campground . <p> From Woy Woy to Tallow Beach , take the 64 bus to the 59 bus , get off near Beach Drive and then walk 45 minutes to the campground . <p> Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , then the ferry to Wagstaffe , and catch a bus to get closer to the campgrounds but this route is a bit more tedious so I would n't recommend it unless the train route does n't align with when you want to leave . <h> What 's your favorite car-free adventure outside of Sydney ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Nice photos Lindsey !

At a mere distance of 370 miles , it 's totally doable as a weekend getaway . You have 3 options for traveling from New York to Montreal : <p> Plane If you 've got more money than time to spare , flying is your best bet . <p> Car If you 're traveling with others , carpooling to/from Montreal is the most affordable option even more so if one of you actually owns a car and you do n't have to rent . <p> Train If you 've got more time than money , or if you 're a solo traveler , taking the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I proudly fell into the latter category . With two weeks to kill before starting a new job and aiming to not further deplete my savings , I wanted to take an affordable trip to Montreal at the last minute . <p> Enter the Adirondack Train ! <p> Aside from the lofty claim of it being one of the most scenic rides in America , there is little information out there about what this Amtrak train ride is actually like . Is it REALLY 11 hours long ? Will I get a stamp to add to my passport ? What 's the outlet situation like ? You know , essential pieces of information for any frugal frolicker . <p> Well , allow me to give you the nitty gritty on the Adirondack Train ! <h> Things to Know About the Adirondack Train to Montreal <h> It is very comfortable . <p> I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the cars are . Each seat has generous legroom at least as much as you get when sitting in the exit row of a plane . What 's more , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stash even large suitcases . Note : It seems like only the last 2 cars have the spacious seating , which is where they seat passengers who are making the full trip ( NYC to/from Montreal ) . The cars on the other side of the cafe car have less legroom . <p> The seats recline , as to be expected ; but another nice perk is the pop-up leg rest . I loved being able to sit indian style or with my legs straight out , laptop on my lap . When you 're on the train for 11+ hours , it really goes make a huge difference in your comfort level being able to change positions throughout the ride . <h> It is well-equipped for all your food and technology needs . <p> Outlets Each pair of seats has 2 outlets right beneath the window essential for keeping your laptop and iPhone charged through the entire ride . <p> Wifi There is wifi in the cafe car , though it is very spotty the further upstate you get . It was barely even usable by the border . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drinks available in the cafe car : they 've even got pizza and wine ( though I did n't try them , so I ca n't vouch for their quality ) . I WILL say that their coffee was pretty awful , though ( at least on one leg of my trip ) . <h> The ride through upstate New York is very scenic . <p> Is it one of the best train rides in North America ? I do n't have much to compare it to , but yes , I 'd say so ! Between the Hudson River Valley and the lakes and farms north of Albany , the entire ride through New York state is picturesque . <p> I ca n't imagine this route being any more beautiful than it is in October , when fall foliage paints a vibrant layer on top of an already-beautiful scene .

Be sure to use a fast shutter speed so that your photos are n't blurry . <p> Most of the time you wo n't have a clear view of the scenery because trees , branches , and powerlines pop up constantly . Between that and the movement of the train , you 're inevitably going to end up with lots of shots with blurred branches in the foreground gross ! Best bet is to set your camera on burst mode and snap like 10 shots in a row , then just keep the ones that are clear . <p> Go to the back of the last car and stand on the little platform between the doors , looking out at the track behind . You 'll have 270-degree views ! <h> You will be questioned during border inspection . <p> It 's always a crapshoot when you pass through passport control at any airport ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ( *cough* UK *cough ) , other times the officer wo n't even say a word to you . <p> The border inspection on the Adirondack train falls somewhere in-between . Expect to be asked several questions , such as where you 're from , what you do , where you 're going why and for how long , where you 're staying , and if you 're bringing any purchased goods into the country . Listen to the officer questioning others nearby and have your answers prepped for when it 's your turn . <p> I got my American passport stamped when crossing the border from the US into Canada , but I did n't notice any foreigners getting their passports stamped when we crossed the border from Canada into the US . My limited google research told me not to expect a stamp , as they 're not always given out . <h> The ride is long . <p> Yes , it really does take 11 hours and this includes the border inspection ( someone told me Amtrak allots 1.5 of these hours for the border crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop for an additional Exit Check just before the border inspection , where a bunch of officers walk through the entire train a few times , checking various things .

@@118792711 @7792711/ <h> An Ode To The Williamsburg Bridge <p> Behold , the Williamsburg Bridge : my favorite of all the bridges in NYC . Its not the prettiest , most famous , or most traversed but I love it fiercely . <p> Our love affair began innocently enough . Shortly after I moved to New York in January 2008 , my weekends fell into a predictable pattern : one day spent in a Brooklyn coffee shop , and the other day spent roaming around- the city . <p> On the latter- day , I would walk out of my apartment with my camera bag and no destination in mind and let myself be drawn to anything that looked interesting along the way . My roommates always asked where I was going , and I 'd always say I did n't  know . I never knew where I was going exactly , but I always knew what I was doing so eventually I started responding with : " I 'm frolicking ! " . <p> THATS RIGHT this is where the backend of my blog name comes- from . Take note , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Every frolic would inevitably funnel- me to the Williamsburg Bridge . Next to the L train , its the most direct way for North Brooklynites to reach Manhattan . The WB and I got to know each other gradually as I walked across it on my weekly jaunts . Things got real serious , real fast once I started commuting to work by bike . Our weekly rendezvous became near-daily ; I just could n't get enough . <p> Make no mistake , though he made me work for his love . You do n't  know leg burn til you 've attempted to bike up the Williamsburg on-ramp on a cruiser . WOOF . <p> Have you ever ridden a cruiser ? They 're extremely comfortable- and extremely slow . Grandfathers , unfit-looking folks , and girls in skirts whip past me as I chug along uphill . At first I was thoroughly annoyed at the limitations of my bike then I realized that it gains- ridiculous momentum- going downhill . I end up flying past everyone- going down the off-ramp and it is SO MUCH FUN . Slow and steady wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts heaps of constantly-changing graffiti , though most of it is not particularly artful . The ramp on the Manhattan side has been adorned with hundreds of- these colorful ovals for years now . They remind me of those nail polish samples you see at a mani/pedi salon . I love bright colors and painted nails , so this- bit of art brings me much joy whenever I bike into the city . <p> I usually do n't  get to admire the views as I 'm biking across the bridge , but the north side in particular has some great ones . The Brooklyn side ramp yields views over the Williamsburg rooftops , while the Manhattan side looks out over the Lower East Side projects and FDR Drive . <p> The south side of the bridge is meant for pedestrians only , so you 're better able to capture the views from that side . On the Brooklyn half of it , you can catch a glimpse of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges . Back in my running days , I 'd time my runs so I 'd end up crossing the Williamsburg Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm always fascinated by my fellow commuters and bridge crossers . Bikes , scooters , and skateboards dominate the north side path ; runners , tourists , and Hasidic Jews have a solid hold on the south side path . <p> Down below there 's a whole other layer of traffic crossing the East River . The J and M trains rumble down the center every few minutes , while cars speed by on either side of the tracks . It seems like every third vehicle charging past is a yellow cab , which is almost remarkable since so many cabbies avoid trekking into Brooklyn . <p> On mornings when the cars are stop-and-go , I like to speed up on my bike and try to beat them into Manhattan . Know what the least-pleasant morning commute entails ? A wailing ambulance stuck in traffic trying to reach the city . Nothing like entering Manhattan with ringing ears ! <p> Crossing the Williamsburg Bridge is my absolute favorite , but he looks damn good from below as well .

@@118792719 @7792719/ <h> A Guide To Bouddi National Park <p> I originally came across Bouddi National Park on the Central Coast of New South Wales in my perpetual quest to find awesome outdoor adventures that are accessible without a car . Someday I 'll get comfortable driving in Australia and some year I 'll be able to afford a car . But for now , I 'm at the mercy of public transit and friends with motor vehicles , which I suppose is n't the worst problem to have , now is it ? <p> It may have taken me 3 months to pry myself away from the sensational beaches around my new home in Bondi , but I finally managed to venture further afield last week to explore this gloriously under-touristed pocket of nature . <p> As a disclaimer : yes , you can reach the campgrounds , beaches , and coastal walk in Bouddi National Park by public transport . However , it will take you multiple transfers between trains and buses ( and potentially ferries ) that you have to time exactly right if you want to reach Bouddi National Park from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ! <p> First , let 's talk about why Bouddi National Park makes for a fantastic weekend getaway from Sydney ( or weekday , if you 're self-employed like I am Monday camping trips for the win ! ) . <h> An Introduction To Bouddi National Park <p> The Central Coast of NSW spans about 30 miles of coastline between Sydney and Newcastle : specifically , from the mouth of the Hawkesbury River to the south end of Lake Macquarie . It tends to conjure up images of idyllic surf spots and peaceful beaches . <p> Bouddi National Park occupies the southernmost end of the Central Coast . If you want beachfront camping and coastal walks , this place is your jam . There are a few other trails in the park that run inland or to specific beaches from the main road , but the Bouddi Coastal Walk is the park 's crown jewel . You 'd be crazy to miss it ! <p> Tip : Download this map/brochure to get your bearings with all the beaches and trails available within Bouddi National Park . <h> Bouddi Coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The best stretch of the Bouddi Coastal Walk runs for 3km along the coast from Putty Beach to Maitland Bay . Putty Beach itself I found quite underwhelming and probably the least scenic of the 7 or so beaches within the national park , but one thing it does have going for it is the stellar view of the Barrenjoey Headland at Palm Beach . <p> Much of this trail segment is lined with boardwalk , making it a very easy walk between beaches . The first bit of it , up from Putty Beach , has some cool-looking rock to ogle and a patch of tessellated pavement . <p> Shortly after these rocks , there 's a sign marking the continuation of the coastal track to Maitland Bay , and a side trail to Bullimah- Beach . Do I even need to tell you to take the beach-bound track ? <p> You guys , this one 's now in the running for one of my favorite beaches near Sydney . When I first glimpsed these bright blue hues beyond the boardwalk , my face quickly morphed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sunny hours sunbathing there . <p> The sand at this beach is unlike any I 've seen elsewhere . It 's a coarse kind of sand , with teeny-tiny purple and white pebbles mixed in with golden sand . Too cool ! <p> Back on the Bouddi Coastal Walk , follow the trail uphill into the bush to reach Gerrin Point Lookout . The views from up here of the rocks below and the beaches in the distance are fabulous . <p> The rest of the trail from Gerrin Point to Maitland Bay is part-coastal walk and part-bushwalk . It 's a little less dramatic than the previous segment , but still pleasant and worth the effort to reach Maitland Bay Beach . <h> Maitland Bay to Little Beach ( 3.5km ) <p> Maitland Bay Beach feels like a little oasis , due to its seclusion . Access between Maitland Bay and the parking lot on the main road is via the very steep Maitland Bay Track ( 1km one-way ) . Golden sand and no crowds make this one a classic Aussie beach you should n't miss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2017 , the segment of trail from Maitland Bay to Little Beach was partially closed off to hikers so I ended up walking up the Maitland Bay Track and along The Scenic Road ( yep , that 's the name of the main road through the national park ) to the Little Beach Trail instead . It was doable , but quite hilly and lacking sidewalks on the main road . <p> If the Bouddi Coastal Walk is open between Little Beach and Maitland Bay when you 're there , you 'll walk across Maitland Bay Beach instead and continue along the trail rather than taking the Maitland Bay Track uphill . Just know that most of it does n't actually run along the coast so you 'll be in for more of a bushwalk than a coastal walk . <p> At Little Beach , you 'll find a few campsites as well as BBQ and picnic facilities for daytime use . This is also a great surf spot if the swell is cooperating . <p> Mourawaring Moor Trail . <h> Little Beach to Macmasters Beach ( 1.7km ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland rather than along the coast , but it 's still scenic and offers a couple of side trail options with beach views . <p> From Little Beach , cross the little creek and follow the trail uphill through the trees . Within minutes , you 'll find yourself walking on a sandy maintenance track called the Mourawaring Moor Trail . There are a couple of side tracks leading toward the coast that you can venture down if you have some time . This is what the Second Point Trail looks like : <p> Macmasters Beach from Second Point Trail . <p> The Mourawaring Moor Trail will soon deposit you onto Beachview Esplanade , a paved road . Walk a few minutes down the road and look for a dirt track between houses #51 and 53 this is the Macmasters Beach Walking Track , though it 's not labeled . <p> This trail leads into Macmaster Parade , though you 'll only be on it for a minute before you take the walking track around house #37 that leads down to Macmasters Beach . <p> Macmasters Beach is absolutely gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( by the Surf Lifesaving Club ) that 's particularly beautiful with the nearby headland reflecting on it . <h> Camping in Bouddi National Park <p> Bouddi is one of the few places in New South Wales that offers beachfront camping ( at least officially ) . These campsites book out far in advance on non-winter weekends , so be sure to reserve ahead of time if you 're planning a weekend camping trip . <p> Little Beach Campground- is the most ideally located of the three , I think , because you can walk toward Macmasters Beach in one direction or Putty Beach in the other . It 's open to day trippers during daylight hours , but come nightfall it 'll be quiet . There are bush toilets , picnic tables , and a BBQ . Campsites are $33/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <p> Note : I camped at Little Beach and walked to Macmasters Beach and back on Day 1 ; then on Day 2 , I packed up camp and hiked with all my gear from Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most family-friendly of the three , as you can easily drive and park right by your campsite . The sites are n't right on the beach , but are just a few minutes ' walk from it . This campground is the most built up in terms of facilities , offering flush toilets , an outdoor shower , and drinking water . Campsites are $33/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <p> Tallow Beach Campground- is the most remote of the three , requiring a 1.2km walk from the car park . It 's a bit inconvenient if you 're looking to do the coastal walk or other hikes within the national park , but ideal if all you want is to camp in seclusion near a beautiful beach . There 's nothing but a bush toilet here , so bring your own stove if you plan to cook . Campsites are $24/night for two people and increase in price as you add more people . <h> Getting to Bouddi National Park <p> Depending on where in Sydney you 're located , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park . The buses that operate around the park are quite infrequent though , so you 'll want to consult Google Maps or better yet the Opal transit app to plan your route . When I was looking to travel from Sydney to Little Beach , I found there was n't a way to get there on a Sunday hence my Monday excursion . <p> From Sydney Central Station , catch the train towards Newcastle and get off at either Woy Woy ( for Putty Beach ) or Gosford ( for Little Beach ) . <p> From Gosford to Little Beach , take the 64 to the 65 bus , get off near Namatjira Drive and then walk 25 minutes to the campground . <p> From Woy Woy to Putty Beach , take the 64 bus to the 59 bus , get off near Beach Drive and then walk 9 minutes to the campground . <p> From Woy Woy to Tallow Beach , take the 64 bus to the 59 bus , get off near Beach Drive and then walk 45 minutes to the campground . <p> Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , then the ferry to Wagstaffe , and catch a bus to get closer to the campgrounds but this route is a bit more tedious so I would n't recommend it unless the train route does n't align with when you want to leave . <h> What 's your favorite car-free adventure outside of Sydney ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Nice photos Lindsey !

@@118792723 @7792723/ <h> The Big Thing I Learned From Hiking The Overland Track <p> I just showered and gorged on vegetables for the first time in a week and IT FELT AMAZING . <p> Instead of being kind to my body and giving it those things it craves on a near-daily basis , I put it through hell these past 6 days while hiking the Overland Track . <p> Honestly , this 16-day jaunt in Tasmania has been the most loosely ( read : non ) planned trip Ive ever embarked on . Its very unlike me not to thoroughly research all my options and efficiently plan out my days , at least to some extent . I guess I figure I 'm in Australia for a whole year with no real time crunch and maybe part of me really wants to free bird this whole thing and see what happens . <p> So this is how my Overland Track ( non- ) planning went down : <p> Purchased a permit online and chose a start date shortly after our Tassie roadtrip would end <p> Decided on a 6 day trek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets to/from trail in advance <p> Briefly glanced at the recommended gear list and confirmed I already had most of it <p> Got really cold one night on the roadtrip and bought a warmer jacket to take with me on the trek <p> That 's it . I did n't  look at a map , did n't  plan a route , did n't  look into the trek at all . All I knew was that the Overland Track is considered one of the best hikes in the world , and is not meant to be all that strenuous . Good enough , right ? <p> It did n't  matter how much I planned or did n't  plan . I knew I was going to make it through the hike , and I did . Those 6 days felt like much , much longer than that , and they taught me one key fact about my hiking style : <p> I really love open air , mountainous ( or coastal ) landscapes <p> and I really do n't  love the forest . <p> I had some inkling that this was my preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immersed myself in the other side . I 'd never hiked extensively through the woods before and you know what , it must have been because I had no interest in doing so . My previous big hikes all entailed big skies and dramatic views , from Waimanu Valley in Hawaii to the Everest Base Camp Trek , to most recently the Laugavegur Trek in Iceland . <p> I need to see the sky when I 'm walking : it both orients and soothes me . I love chasing the horizon , admiring the clouds above , feeling the sun warm my skin . <p> What a little research may have taught me sooner is that the Overland Track runs mostly through forest . A few bits of it pass through open air moors and around mountains , though : in fact , there are several options for summitting along the trail . I was all amped to climb Mount Ossa , Tassies highest mountain , but it was raining with low visibility when I reached the trailhead so my fellow hikers and I passed on it . With the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day , most every other mountain I passed looked fogged over like this : <p> So with no mountains to climb , I spent most of the 6 days beneath the trees in semi-darkness . I had no idea how far I had gone or how close I was to the next landmark until I hit it . Minutes felt like hours in the woods . It was disorienting to say the least ! <p> On the third day we got smacked with nonstop rain . I was trudging through the dark forest , or never-ending mud maze as I dubbed it midway through , and had n't  seen any trail markers in over an hour . It sure looked like I was on the trail , and I had n't  seen any turnoffs , but after two days of ALWAYS having at least one trail marker in sight , I started to worry . Turning around and revisiting all the puddles and tree roots I had oh-so-carefully sidestepped so as to minimize foot pain and slippage was about the last thing I wanted to do , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong direction would have been even worse . <p> I turned around , trudged back for about 20 minutes , then sheepishly ran into some fellow hikers who reassured me that we were going the right way . WHEW . <p> Really , though , how miserable does this look ? There were some parts of the trail that were just one giant vat of mud . There was no getting around it without going ankle-deep in the stuff . <p> I 'd relax for a few seconds upon sight of the occasional boardwalk through the forest . FINALLY , a moment where my mind would n't have to calculate the best way around roots , a puddle , or a giant mud clump . That shit gets exasperating real fast , let me tell you . The best ( worst ) though , is when a pretty little boardwalk like this brings you straight to a massive mud puddle lined with tree roots its like , what 's the point ? <p> I 'm glad I did the Overland Track , though . I actually did n't  hate it , despite all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I 'll be highlighting in future posts . And I saw these cute critters every single day I 'd assumed they were wallabies , but they 're called pademelons : <p> Lesson learned ? I do n't  like hiking through the woods or playing in mud . I think I 'll stick to mountain climbs and coastal walks for future treks ! <p> On that note : the Three Capes Track on the Tasman Peninsula is due to open this November .

@@118792724 @7792724/ <h> An Ode To The Williamsburg Bridge <p> Behold , the Williamsburg Bridge : my favorite of all the bridges in NYC . Its not the prettiest , most famous , or most traversed but I love it fiercely . <p> Our love affair began innocently enough . Shortly after I moved to New York in January 2008 , my weekends fell into a predictable pattern : one day spent in a Brooklyn coffee shop , and the other day spent roaming around- the city . <p> On the latter- day , I would walk out of my apartment with my camera bag and no destination in mind and let myself be drawn to anything that looked interesting along the way . My roommates always asked where I was going , and I 'd always say I did n't  know . I never knew where I was going exactly , but I always knew what I was doing so eventually I started responding with : " I 'm frolicking ! " . <p> THATS RIGHT this is where the backend of my blog name comes- from . Take note , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Every frolic would inevitably funnel- me to the Williamsburg Bridge . Next to the L train , its the most direct way for North Brooklynites to reach Manhattan . The WB and I got to know each other gradually as I walked across it on my weekly jaunts . Things got real serious , real fast once I started commuting to work by bike . Our weekly rendezvous became near-daily ; I just could n't get enough . <p> Make no mistake , though he made me work for his love . You do n't  know leg burn til you 've attempted to bike up the Williamsburg on-ramp on a cruiser . WOOF . <p> Have you ever ridden a cruiser ? They 're extremely comfortable- and extremely slow . Grandfathers , unfit-looking folks , and girls in skirts whip past me as I chug along uphill . At first I was thoroughly annoyed at the limitations of my bike then I realized that it gains- ridiculous momentum- going downhill . I end up flying past everyone- going down the off-ramp and it is SO MUCH FUN . Slow and steady wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts heaps of constantly-changing graffiti , though most of it is not particularly artful . The ramp on the Manhattan side has been adorned with hundreds of- these colorful ovals for years now . They remind me of those nail polish samples you see at a mani/pedi salon . I love bright colors and painted nails , so this- bit of art brings me much joy whenever I bike into the city . <p> I usually do n't  get to admire the views as I 'm biking across the bridge , but the north side in particular has some great ones . The Brooklyn side ramp yields views over the Williamsburg rooftops , while the Manhattan side looks out over the Lower East Side projects and FDR Drive . <p> The south side of the bridge is meant for pedestrians only , so you 're better able to capture the views from that side . On the Brooklyn half of it , you can catch a glimpse of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges . Back in my running days , I 'd time my runs so I 'd end up crossing the Williamsburg Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm always fascinated by my fellow commuters and bridge crossers . Bikes , scooters , and skateboards dominate the north side path ; runners , tourists , and Hasidic Jews have a solid hold on the south side path . <p> Down below there 's a whole other layer of traffic crossing the East River . The J and M trains rumble down the center every few minutes , while cars speed by on either side of the tracks . It seems like every third vehicle charging past is a yellow cab , which is almost remarkable since so many cabbies avoid trekking into Brooklyn . <p> On mornings when the cars are stop-and-go , I like to speed up on my bike and try to beat them into Manhattan . Know what the least-pleasant morning commute entails ? A wailing ambulance stuck in traffic trying to reach the city . Nothing like entering Manhattan with ringing ears ! <p> Crossing the Williamsburg Bridge is my absolute favorite , but he looks damn good from below as well .

I did n't  go down to the rock pools in Uluwatu even though I was right there . I did n't  make it up to the epic Tanur Lot temple . I skipped the sunrise hike up Mt . Batur , and the Gili Islands , and Canggu . I did EVERYTHING wrong in Java . <p> But when it comes to beaches , I do n't  mess around . I will go out of my way to research , plan , and get myself somewhere if it involves a particularly stunning patch of coastline . ( Ill also do the same for coffee , but that 's neither here nor there ) <p> I think I 've mentioned this before , but you guys Bali is NOT the place to go if you 're seeking ridiculously beautiful beaches . There are many other countries that do them better ( *ahem* , Australia being one ) . Bali has some decent beaches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nevertheless , I was determined to find a picturesque plot of sand in Bali worth writing home about . Google ( and The Bali Bible ) did not let me down , because boy did I find the mother of all Bali beaches . <p> Behold , Karma Beach ! <p> This gem is nestled on the southern coast of Bali , a part of the island not particularly visited for its beaches because of its very-high cliffs . Much of the coast is either inaccessible , or simply is n't worth the effort of climbing down and then back up again ( filed under Things I Did Wrong : Nyang Nyang Beach . SO not worth the sweat I endured the previous day ! ) . <p> However , the uber-fancy Karma Kandara Resort has staked claim on a STUNNING white sand beach in Bali , built a cabana bar on it , and continually kept it looking pristine for its guests enjoyment . <p> But the best part ? You can still access this exclusive beach even if you 're not staying at the resort ! Karma Kandara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about US$18.60 ) , which includes a cable car ride up and down , plus 100,000 IDR credit toward food and beverage purchases on the beach . This frugalista knows a good deal when she sees one , and without hesitation I devoted one of my last days in Bali to this magnificent beach excursion . <p> Day trippers are n't  allowed in the clifftop pool , but you 'll pass by it and swoon on the way to the cable car . <p> Taking the cable car down the cliff was at least half of the fun of the days adventure . I snap-snap-snapped my way down as more and more white sand and thatched cabana rooftops came into view . How glorious is this view ? ! <p> I alighted the cable car and was immediately greeted by a staff member and shown to my beach chair . The front row chairs are reserved for resort guests , which did n't  bother me all too much because I figured I 'd spend most of my time either frolicking or dozing . <p> First things first , though : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digs . <p> More than satisfied with my surroundings , I plopped onto my chair and ordered a fresh green juice that was price-wise on par with what I would have paid back in NYC ( possibly slightly pricier ) , and then proceeded to turn various shades of pink over the course of the afternoon . Bliss ! <p> They also have free paddle boards and snorkeling gear for use at the beach , but when I was there the cutoff time for using the boards was 6pm . Had I known , I would have gotten my SUP on earlier in the day ! <p> And on Mondays , they show movies on the beach after sunset . I 'm a massive fan of alfresco movies , especially when they 're free ! <p> I could n't *not* stick around for sunset , but I was kinda bummed that I had waited to see this dud ( I mean , Ive seen worse , but ) . Shortly after , I shuffled back to the cable car and waited to go back up the cliff . <p> But then the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach as soon as I saw these pink rays erupt . How does the sky pull this kind of magic ? ? Amazing is such an overused word and therefore does n't  do it proper justice , but I truly was amazed by this sunset . <p> If you 're looking for the most beautiful beach in Bali , Karma Beach at Karma Kandara Resort may just be it .

@@118792727 @7792727/ <h> Borobudur At Sunrise : A Travel Dream Come True <p> About 12 years ago , I was just finishing up my first semester of college with a killer lineup of classes : math , mystery writing , psych 101 , and hows this for fitting ? Introduction to Southeast Asia . <p> Now , keep in mind this was 18-year-old Lindsay : I 'd hardly traveled at all before starting my Cornell degree , and from Day 1 I was fixated on studying abroad in Australia . With my Aussie tunnel vision and lack of travels , I do n't  think Asia was even on my radar at that time . But I came upon this class in the course catalogue and could n't get over how exotic it sounded . <p> Sadly , I do n't  remember much from my Intro to SEA class ( or any of my classes , if Im honest ) , with the exception of one thing : Borobudur , the worlds largest Buddhist temple . I remember looking at pictures of those majestic stupas and bas reliefs in my textbook , thinking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd hoped to work Borobudur into my 2013 Asia trip , but I ended up not making it to Indonesia until my recent trip to Bali some 2.5 years later . I was the closest I 'd ever been to the temple , and even then I found myself wondering if itd be worth the effort of getting there . Itd be infinitely easier just to linger in Ubud and keep enjoying the good life in Bali . <p> But dreams are n't  supposed to come easy , right ? I 'd never see this landmark unless I put in the effort to get there . With that , I cast my poolside lounge chair- and vitamin-laced smoothie aside and spent a week traversing East Java . First stop : Borobudur ! <h> Sunrise At Borobudur <p> I usually prefer to wing it and rock up to a new destination without a plan , but in anticipation of all the connections I 'd need to make in order to reach Borobudur by public transport , I wanted to make the journey as smooth as possible for myself and- booked a- room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most other homestay options , but if you want to be guaranteed a comfortable and enjoyable stay very close to the temple , its a great choice . <p> I was especially appreciative of the complimentary escort to the temple : from the 4:15am wakeup call to the quick drive to the Manohara Hotel to purchase sunrise tickets , to the hike up to the exact spot where I 'd stand and wait for the sun to rise . I know it would have been an extremely rough commute had I had to- do any thinking for myself at that ungodly hour. - ( Does anyone else feel nauseous when trying to function in the middle of the night ? My body just DOES NOT want to cooperate before 7am . ) <p> We arrived around 4:30am , about an hour before sunrise . While the dark and foggy surroundings werent ideal for taking pictures , I loved just absorbing the quiet and calm and having some time to process the fact that I was actually here , standing on this magnificent temple that I 'd studied in school 12 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have hoped ( it photographed better than it looked ! ) . If I were to do sunrise at Borobudur again , I 'd wait it out on the bottom-most level of stupas so that I could snag an unobstructed photo of the Buddha statue in the foreground . I was perched just above it on the next level up , but there were several selfie stick-equipped tourists below me hovering around the Buddha that ruined my shot of it . <h> Golden Hour At Borobudur <p> The highlight of my time at Borobudur was the hour after sunrise : golden hour , in photography-nerd terms . Much of the crowd dispersed after the sun came up , and non-sunrise ticket holders are n't  allowed in til after 6am , - which meant I could roam around the temple without bumping into too many other tourists . <p> Even better , the light at this time was just magical and perfect for photography . I loved capturing the glowing stupas as the fog began to lift . <p> I think this is one of those times where words do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and let my photos take it from here ! <h> How To Avoid The Crowds At Borobudur <p> By 6:30am , hoards of school children and eager tourists had ascended the temple . It was like being woken up from the most pleasant of dreams . Once it became near-impossible to take a photo without another person in the frame , I started making my exit . <p> Then some school groups started stalking me ! They must have sniffed out a white girl on her own and counted me as prime prey to pounce on . - The first time it happened , they inquired- oh-so-sweetly in broken English if they could ask me a few questions . By the third time , it was clear that all of these school groups had an agenda : to interview tourists with the same basic questions , prompted by cue cards , while capturing it on video with their phones . Oh , and let 's not forget about the follow-up photos with each kid posing individually with me . <p> It was cute the first time , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-growing crowd wasnt- enough to scare me off from Borobudur , these incessant interviews may have pushed me over the edge . <h> Book the Borobudur Sunrise Ticket <p> The single best piece of advice I have for you is to book the Borobudur sunrise ticket at the Manohara Hotel . For not even $8 more than the price of the normal Borobudur admission , you get to enter the temple ahead of the crowd . And , ok sure , you get to see sunrise from the temple , too . <p> But honestly , I 'd pay just for the privilege of exploring Borobudur without the crowd no matter what time of day . For me , it lost most of its magic as soon as the golden light faded and people started swarming every stupa . You 're not going to get any people-less photos unless you go to see Borobudur at sunrise . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> Borobudur sunrise tickets can only be purchased at the Manohara Hotel . They cost 380,000 IDR ( US$27.75 ) and grant you early entry starting at 4:30am , a flashlight so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee/tea and biscuits at the hotel afterwards . You can just show up at the Manohara around 4:30am and buy your sunrise ticket on the spot . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

However , I 'd advise spending an extra 15 minutes on the train and heading to the town of Varenna instead . Varenna is much more charming than Como , and its aptly positioned halfway up the eastern side of the lake which makes it an ideal base for exploring . <p> If you heed my advice and stay at least one night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake to Menaggio . Either way , purchase a ferry day pass in Varenna because you 're definitely going to need it to explore the villages around the lake . <p> View from La Primula hostel . <h> Budget Accommodation on Lake Como <p> If you 're not jetting back to Milan right away , book yourself- a bed at La Primula Hostel- in Menaggio . Not only is it the cheapest accommodation option on the lake , but it boasts the best value views anywhere on Lake Como . The photo above was taken from the hostels outdoor patio not bad for 20 euros a night ! <h> Exploring- Lake Como <p> If all you have is one day to explore Lake Como , - - stick to the holy trinity of Varenna Menaggio Bellagio . These three towns in the heart of the lake are all connected via a 15 minute ferry ride- with routes that form a triangle ( see map above ) . <p> While there are other towns and villages around Lake Como , these three are close together , easy to travel between , and exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and- glimpse views of the lake and surrounding mountains no matter which village you 're in . By- devoting a full day to explore them , you 'll have plenty of time to slow down and savor the proverbial- dolce vita without feeling like a tourist . <h> Bellagio <p> Of the three villages , Bellagio is the runaway favorite amongst visitors to Lake Como . With- near-360 degree views from the headland at the center of the lake , there 's a pretty decent chance itll be your favorite , too . <p> Villa Serbelloni hosts the best panoramic view of Lake Como : - if- you 're a guest at this five star resort , you get a literal front row seat . The rest of us can sneak a peek through the gates or opt to take a guided tour of the grounds and gardens , which costs 9 euros for a 1.5 hour tour . <p> Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio . <p> But- you do n't  have to splash out on a fancy hotel to enjoy the best of Bellagio . All you need- is two feet and a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets and wander to nearby villages and hamlets along the lake . <p> Pescallo is an extremely picturesque little fishing hamlet near Bellagio . There 's an excellent chance you 'll be able to soak in the vistas of terraced hills and sailboats without another person in sight . <p> This exact view was pictured in a calendar I once owned ; I found it in Pescallo , - a fishing hamlet- near- Bellagio . <p> And of course , should your wallet be burning a hole through your pocket or bag , there are plenty of boutiques and restaurants in Bellagio , Varenna , and Menaggio that would be happy to take your money .

@@118792731 @7792731/ <h> Infiorata : Italys Flower Carpet Festival <p> My 5 week backpacking trip around Italy in 2007 was my first major solo travel endeavor . I researched and planned like mad and more or less threw myself into a foreign land without a second thought . Though I did n't really know what I was doing , it went exceedingly well . <p> I 've definitely refined my travel skills in the 7+ years since then , learning from travel mistakes and crafting better trips . My main takeaway from Italy ? Always research which festivals or events are going on around the time you 're planning to take your trip . I did n't even think to do this before I booked my flight to Milan , but by chance in my research I came across Infiorata , a festival happening throughout different towns across Italy in May and June luckily enough , the same timespan I 'd be in the country . I checked my meticulously-planned route and noticed that I was due to be in Umbria riiiiiight around the day Infiorata would be celebrated in Spello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at Infiorata in Spello , Italy <h> What is Infiorata ? <p> In short : Infiorata is a festival held on the night of the Corpus Domini feast , commemorated by constructing colorful flower carpets on the streets . It usually takes place on the 9th Sunday after Easter , commonly falling in the late May to mid June period . Groups of townspeople band together as far as a year in advance to design a socio-religious themed scene and prepare its floral manifestation the night before the procession . <p> During the year-long preparation period , flowers and other natural materials are gathered and processed . Some are collected and dried out months in advance , while others are picked fresh . Technically participants are allowed to use any natural material , such as berries , leaves , fennel , coffee grounds , and hay however , the Infiorata in Spello is unique because its flower carpets are comprised solely of wildflowers collected from the Umbrian countryside throughout the year . <p> As I was walking around town on Saturday afternoon , I watched as older Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petals to use that night . Elsewhere , petals were being put through machines that chopped them up into tiny pieces . <p> From Saturday afternoon through the night , flower carpets are assembled all over town . Most are enclosed within tents , primarily to shield the participants from the sun as they work though I also suspect each team prefers to keep their work hidden until the unveiling on Sunday morning . <p> The tapestry is mapped out on the ground , either sketched in chalk or drawn on a large white sheet of paper . Each section is labelled with a different color name , from bianco to giallo to rosso and various shades in-between , not unlike a paint-by-number montage . Except instead of painting , the Italians carefully fill each section with a different colored petal , varying in texture and shade . I observed their technique , noticing how they 'd use a small card to delicately push the petals just inside the lines of the pattern with such precision . <p> I returned to Spello on Sunday morning to find the main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a good look at the finished flower tapestries . There were small ladders set up by most of them which you could climb to get a view from above , but I was so frustrated by people who would cut in front of me that I could n't be bothered fighting my way in . The amount of people crammed into this tiny town for the celebration was a bit much for me to handle , so I quickly browsed the flower displays and headed out before the procession began . <p> Despite the heat and the crowds on the last day , I 'm so glad I got to experience Infiorata in Spello . Between the impressive flower tapestries and the small-town charm of Spello itself , it was well worth the effort of incorporating it into my Italy trip . <h> How to plan for Infiorata <p> There are several towns throughout Italy where you can catch the Infiorata . Most take place on the 9th Sunday after Easter , though some towns ( e.g. Noto ) celebrate on a different day . <p> Noto ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umbria ) <p> Bolsena ( Lazio ) <p> Pienza ( Tuscany ) <p> Orvieto ( Umbria ) <p> Potenzoni di Briatico ( Calabria ) <p> Brugnato ( Liguria ) <p> Fidenza ( Emilia Romagna ) <p> No matter which you choose , plan to be there the Saturday evening and Sunday morning of Corpus Domini . On Saturday night you 'll be able to watch the townspeople construct their flower carpets , and on Sunday you 'll witness the procession down a street full of flower carpet scenes . <p> Because I was an inexperienced traveler and on a tight budget , I booked most of my accommodation in advance for my 5 weeks in Italy . There were n't any hostels in Spello , so I ended up booking a bed in Foligno , just a 5 minute train ride away . While this option was kinder to my wallet , it was a slight hassle having to plan my time at the Infiorata in Spello around the infrequent trains .

@@118792732 @7792732/ <p> To be certain , Chiang Mai is the place to base yourself in Thailand for activities and excursions . But its definitely worth spending some time in the city itself if your schedule permits . In fact , a few of my most memorable experiences during my 2013 Asia trip happened in Chiang Mai : <h> 1 . The Chiang Mai Night Market <p> Chiang Mai has a few different markets ; the one you want to go to is held on Sunday nights within the old city ( and is aka the Sunday Walking Streets ) . It is so fantastic that I planned my second stint in Chiang Mai around a Sunday . <p> The Chiang Mai Sunday Walking Street is aptly named this market stretches down one long street for blocks upon blocks , even overflowing onto some of the side streets . here 's how you properly do this market : <h> Grab any snack you see that strikes your fancy and EAT YOUR FACE OFF . <p> The Chinese coconut pancakes were the end of me . But you know me and pancakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you explore , then if you decide to buy anything , retrace your steps at the end of the night and bargain to get some good deals . <p> You 'll see some similar items , but there is far more variety here than at any other Thai market . I did n't  buy much except some perfume and a handmade case for my iPhone . <h> When you 're full from all the face-stuffing and tired from the shopping , stop and get a massage . <p> Scattered along the market are massage chairs and eager masseuses who lure you with their very cheap massages . You can choose between foot , head/neck/shoulders , and back . Quality varies wildly , but you 'll likely pay 80-90 baht per half hour . I had a couple mediocre foot massages ( they tend to be more relaxing than effective ) , but then I also had a back massage where I damn near fell asleep on the sidewalk . <h> 2 . Birds Nest Cafe <p> My neighborhood cafes are very important to me back home in NYC , and I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops that I could see as being my go-to if I lived there . By some stroke of luck , I found my spot just down the street from my hostel . It is totally out of the way and near nothing else of interest , so I 'm not sure how expats have caught on to the amazingness that is Birds Nest Cafe . <p> Speaking as a coffee snob , I will say that their coffee is so-so . But their food is PHENOMENAL . They have a generous selection of both Thai and Mediterranean dishes ( why oh why did n't  I try the hummus and guac ? ) . I sampled the cinnamon coconut smoothie ( served in an actual coconut ) multiple times , as well as their curry , a pesto chicken sandwich , and some kind of local porridge . Ohmygod so good . So so good . <p> But good food and drink is n't enough to make a cafe my go-to ; it also has to have a great ambiance , and be somewhere I can cozy up with my laptop and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both counts : downstairs you can sit on the bench and people watch through the windows , and upstairs you can sit on cushions or in a hammock and chill out . Brilliant ! <h> 3 . The Prison Ladies Massage <p> Are your eyebrows raised right now ? cause mine sure were when someone told me about this Chiang Mai institution . But after hearing about it from several other travelers , I looked into it and decided it was an experience I just HAD to have in Thailand . <p> here 's the scoop : you can get the best massage of your life from a prisoner . They have professionally trained these women in massage therapy and while in prison , they work to earn money to put towards their lives after they are released . Genius concept , right ? <p> Do n't  worry its not like you 're escorted into a room and left alone with a criminal you 've paid to touch your body . All the massages take place in one big open room containing 20 or so massage tables . You might hear some occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . Though I found it interesting that while , yes , this has become quite the tourist attraction , there were also a fair amount of locals who had dropped by for a massage when I was there . <p> Since it was my last week in Thailand , I went all out and got a 1.5 hour massage for less than $12 US . Let me repeat that for emphasis : I got a 90 minute full body + foot massage for less than $12 . I rarely get massages in NYC because I 'm frugal and they go for $80+ per hour , but this seemed pretty legit . My massage was somewhere between relaxing and painful ( I tend to prefer the pain because it means my knots are being worked out ) and definitely worth more than $12 . I could n't have been more satisfied with it . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

That happened over 4 months ago , but the experience is still fresh in my mind . Im excited to finally start sharing it with you guys ! <p> Thanks to Matador Network , I was nominated to join a group of journalists organized by Tourism &amp; Events Queensland ( TEQ ) to hike the Thorsborne Trail on Hinchinbrook Island in May 2015 . We spent 4 days and 3 nights climbing mountains and traversing beaches on Hinchy , one of Queenslands lesser-known islands . Ill be sharing more practical tips on completing the trek in another post ; for now , just sit back , relax , and enjoy 20 of my favorite photos from Hinchinbrook Island ! <p> Our journey to Hinchinbrook Island began in Townsville , where we packed our bags full of dehydrated food and drove 2 hours north to Cardwell . Some journalists in our group admitted to having some trepidation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their back , but everyone was in high spirits before we set off . <p> From Cardwell , a boat whisked us off to Hinchinbrook Island and dropped us at the northern end of the Thorsborne Trail . We oohed and ahhed at- the mountain peaks that soared over the maze of mangrove estuaries while silently coming to terms with reality : soon wed be carrying our body weight and more up- those mountains , in the hot Queensland heat . With several multi-day treks under my belt ( Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal , Laugavegur Trek in- Iceland , Overland Track in Tasmania ) , my confidence overrode my nerves and I stepped off the boat thinking : let 's do this ! <p> The Thorsborne Trail is not a hike you ease into . After crossing the gloriously flat sand at Ramsay Bay , it takes you onwards and upwards . Around the highest point of the trail on Day 1 , there 's a side track- that leads up to Nina Peak . Drop your pack and hike up there with just your camera and water bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll enjoy 360-degree views of nearby mountains , the beaches below , and the estuaries whence you came . <p> Descending Nina Peak , its all downhill to Nina Bay . I loved this beach for its ultra-smooth sand , expansive- low tide , and plentiful coconuts fit for cracking open . Few things feel more satisfying- than fresh coconut water on a hot day . <p> At the south end of Nina Bay begins the rock scrambling portion of the days hike . If you 've never rock climbed before , you may want to take your time on the rocks to ensure you find the proper holdings. - And if you have climbed before , then you 'll likely have no trouble- hopping over rocks on Hinchinbrook Island . <p> Our reward for surviving the first day on the Thorsborne Trail ? Dehydrated spaghetti bolognese and campsites nestled between the beach and this lagoon . My favorite night camping was this first one , at Little Ramsay Bay , where I watched the sunset over the lagoon , then woke up the next morning to watch- the sunrise light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorsborne Trail calls for several creek crossings , - rock scrambling , and more uphill trekking . Most of it is inland rather than along the coast , but there 's a swimming hole along the way that you can jump in to cool off . <p> The days hike concludes at Zoe Bay with a lengthy trek across the sand to the campsites on the south end . I loved how there were a few separate camping areas here : great for privacy ( or escaping the snorers in your group ! ) . <p> While the other journalists were digging into their freeze dried nasi goreng , sharing a goon sack , and passing out before 8pm ( honestly , no judgment Day 2 was a doozy ! ) , I took my camera out for an evening spin on the beach . Sunset reflected in the low tide , followed by stargazing in the sand Hinchy , you slay me ! <p> Zoe Bays a stunner in the morning light , too , dontcha think ? <p> A 15 minute hike into the woods leads to Zoe Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold ! ) swimming hole . I recommend waking early to start the days trek so you can spend more time relaxing here before carrying on . <p> The view from atop Zoe Falls is well worth the steep climb . From here , you can look out over Zoe Bay while lounging in a rock pool just over the edge . One word : EPIC . <p> Day 3 of the Thorsborne Trail is easier than the first two days . After Zoe Falls , the trail is mostly exposed as you cross the saddle and head back over toward the coast . Here , you 'll glimpse the Queensland coast and the nearby Palm Island group . <p> The trail soon- plunges into the forest heading down toward Diamantina Creek and Mulligan Falls . Unlike previous nights , Day 3s campsites are n't  on the beach ; they 're nestled in a stretch of- forest leading up to the falls . <p> Compared to Zoe Falls , I 'd say Mulligan Falls is less impressive , but has a nicer swimming hole . There 's a massive boulder right in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look straight at the falls . Just be wary of the tree snakes that have taken up residence in the surrounding rocks here ! <p> Day 4 of the Thorsborne Trail is ridiculously easy : its just a couple hours walking through flat forest and then across Mulligan Bay beach. - If you like long walks on the beach like I do , you should enjoy this 4km stretch of flat sand . The- finish line is at- Georges Point , where we caught our boat to Lucinda on the mainland . <h> Thank you to Matador Network and TEQ for hosting my stay in Queensland and on the Hinchinbrook Island incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

And for those who might be visiting Queenstown without a car ( e.g. me , circa 3 months ago ) , I 'm delighted to report that one of Queenstowns best hikes is easily accessible from town no driving needed . <p> here 's a quick guide to hiking the Ben Lomond Track in Queenstown ( well , more of a photo essay really you 'll see why ! ) . <h> Ben Lomond Track <p> I was skeptical of just how epic the Ben Lomond Track would be after taking in the view from the Skyline ( the gondola-accessible viewing platform just above town ) . The track makes its way above the Skyline , going much higher up but overlooking Lake Wakatipu from a similar angle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lomond Track and going all the way to the summit . At the very top , you 'll get to enjoy 360-degree views that just are n't  possible down below at the Skyline or even at the Ben Lomond Saddle . <p> To start the hike to Ben Lomond , plug in " Ben Lomond Track " on Google Maps and itll reveal an easy route that takes you to the western side of Queenstown and up to the trailhead . Basically , you just walk west across the Esplanade , and when you hit the 4-way roundabout you take the exit to your right ( the one heading north ) and follow signs for Ben Lomond . <p> The first part of the trail ( about an hour or so ) runs beneath the tree line , so you 're in the forest and shielded from the sun . Watch out for the mountain biking trails that run alongside and intersect the track at various points . <p> Soon you 'll pop out into the open air and leave the trees behind , going up up up to the Ben Lomond Saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual uphill trek to the saddle . You 'll know you 've reached it when you see the sign directing you towards the summit and a whole lot of open space just off the trail ( which by the way is a lovely place to stop for a snack or lunch break or to camp overnight , if you 're willing to lug a tent and all your camping gear ) . <p> There are a couple of side trails that lead off onto ledges nearby highly recommend exploring those as well , if you have time to spare ! Otherwise , expect to spend 3-4 hours return hiking to the Ben Lomond Saddle . <h> Ben Lomond Summit <p> I enjoyed the view from the saddle so much that I wondered if I should bother carrying on to the summit . In this , and most every other hiking scenario ( or really , life scenario ) , I found that YES its always worth exerting that extra bit of effort . Be sure to hike all the way up to the Ben Lomond Summit . This is THE place to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's simply no other view like it . <p> If you decide to go all the way to the Ben Lomond Summit , expect the total hike to take 6-8 hours ( according to the DOC ) . I shamelessly hugged the longer side of that time estimate thanks to plentiful photo , snack , and water breaks . <p> The trail morphs into a steep uphill climb from saddle to summit . If you 're anything like me , you 'll be sweating through your layers in no time and downing water like its going out of style . Take as many breaks as you need to remember , its not a race ! <p> Things start getting- really pretty as you get higher up here . More and more of the mountain ranges to the east and north begin to reveal themselves . <p> Look at all those layers !

Its windy up there ! Definitely pack- layers so you can maximize your time spent soaking in the views while not freezing half to death . Itd be a shame to head right back down because you 're ill-prepared to face the cold winds . <p> The Ben Lomond Track is a fairly straightforward hike . The trail is easy to follow , though I will say that there was one part of it below the tree line where I missed a- turn going back down and ended up at a dead end , all dazed and confused . But then I just retraced my steps back to the trail and easily corrected myself , no harm done. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . <p> Also , the only place you can refill your water on the trail is about halfway up the below-the-tree-line segment , where all of the mountain bike trails intersect .

Or , more accurately , being driven around Iceland by my friends whose driving skills are far superior to mine . No , instead of driving , I bring a random smattering of other useful skills to roadtrips : researching awesome and preferably offbeat stops along the way , negotiating discounts , frantically phoning guesthouses late at night to inquire whether they have an available room at an affordable price , crafting playlists of the cheesy pop and/or classic rock persuasion , getting un-lost after a wrong turn or three , finding backcountry campsites . <p> And most importantly : taking kickass photos . <p> You know how it is when you see something so beautiful you ca n't help but stare ? Ca n't help but wonder if it 's a dream ? That 's Iceland that 's ALL of Iceland . I took hundreds of photos of the passing scenery from the car windows in an attempt to prove that what we were seeing was real . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , and other Icelandic attractions along the way , but even if you did n't if you just went to Iceland and all you did was drive around you 'd still see some ridiculously beautiful things . <p> The photos below were taken either from or within 20 feet of our car while driving on the Ring Road and other side streets in Iceland ( clockwise heading north from Reykjavik ) <h> The Westfjords <h> North Iceland <h> East Iceland <h> South Iceland <h> Which region in Iceland has the prettiest scenery ? 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Great question ! It really depends on your travel style . If you camp , $0-10/night for the campsite ; a hostel dorm bed is $30-40 . Meals are very expensive no matter where you go , but if you buy groceries and cook for yourself you can save a lot of money . Car rental is pretty expensive as well , but can be made more affordable if you split it with others . <p> I might get into specifics of what I paid for this trip in a future blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will be traveling to Iceland this August for 2 weeks . Did you find it helpful to pre-book accommodation while driving around the island ? Or did you just stop when you felt like you did n't  want to drive any further and find a place to stay ? We plan to bring a tent but I 'm sure I 'll want to stay in actual hotels/hostels or an AirBnB a few of the nights . <p> Great question ! We only prebooked our accom in Reykjavik and on the Laugavegur Trek . We had planned to just pull over and camp whenever we felt like it while driving around on the other days , but sometimes it was a bit tricky to find a suitable spot or contend with the rain , so then we ended up wasting time driving around looking for a place to stop . If I did it again , I might have done a bit more research or rented a campervan instead . <p> Julie G. <p> Thanks for the quick reply !

Sure , I 'd traveled alone a bit the previous year while studying abroad in Australia , but certainly not for five weeks straight . <p> And I mean it when I say I was alone . Fresh out of college , I wanted this trip to be mediative and immersive , and aside from practicing my Italian with shopkeepers and waiters , I hardly spoke to anyone . It was the uber-introverts dream trip : I did everything I wanted to do on my own time , got lost in my thoughts and writing , and had a blast experimenting with my new camera ( my first dSLR , the Canon Digital Rebel 400D ) . <p> Aside from being my first big solo travel adventure , for which I skipped both senior week and my graduation from Cornell University ( #noregrets ) , several other " things " come to mind when I think of Italy . For some reason , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead my mind jumps to churches and mountains and ruins , memorable things I encountered throughout the country rather than in just one place . <p> Italy has a lot of distinct " things " , some of which I 'll highlight below but first a little disclaimer : <p> I 'm not a foodie , I 'm an cheap outdoor adventurer as such , there will be no mention of pizza or wine ( though I do love them so ! ) <p> My photo-taking skills and camera gear have dramatically improved since I took these photos 7.5 years ago try not to judge the Italy photos below too harshly ! <h> Italy Has Fountains <p> Super random , but one of the first things that comes to mind when I think of Italy is its fountains . There are fountains EVERYWHERE in Italian cities , ranging from small nondescript spigots , to animal sculptures with water spouting out of their mouths , to more ornate fountains . My fascination led me to take photograph the begeezus out of them , *cough* : <p> Trevi Fountain in Rome <h> Where To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fountains , but the most impressive ones tend to be in the major cities like Rome , Florence , and Milan . <h> Italy Has Ruins ( &amp; Other Really Old Things ) <p> DUH OF ALL DUHS . Rome is practically synonymous with ruins , with landmarks like the Colosseum and the Pantheon being two of the best preserved and most impressive sites from the late Roman Empire . The lesser known Palatine Hill and Roman Forum are also well worth taking a stroll around . Its extremely humbling to look at a diagram of what structure used to stand there , then glance up at what remains today . They do n't  make em like that anymore , that 's for sure . <p> Fun fact : I spent the day of my Cornell graduation at the Colosseum . So worth it ! <h> Where To Find Them ? <p> Romes not the only place where you can find ruins in Italy . Just south of Naples is Pompeii , an old Roman city destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD . Additionally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Roman theaters to Greek temples . <p> I wish I 'd had time to hit all of these ruins on my Italy trip , but instead I went out of my way to visit Matera , a town in the south known for its ancient cave dwellings ( called sassi ) , a la The Passion of the Christ . No , they 're not massive Roman buildings-turned-ruins , but they do fall under the category of Really Old Things . These caves were inhabited as early as the Paleolithic era some 3000+ years ago and are still lived in now . There is just so much history in this country . <h> Italy Has Churches <p> Italy and Catholicism go hand in hand . Therefore , saying that there are a lot of churches in Italy is probably unnecessary but hey , I had to . <p> Really though SO MANY CHURCHES . The remarkable thing though is that Italy kicks butt in both the quantity AND quality of its churches . Italian churches are insanely beautiful like , you could walk into a dull looking church and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling , or details around the altar , or frescos on the walls . My old camera did no justice in capturing these amazing churches , which clearly means I need to go back to Italy for a redo . <p> St. Marks in Venice <p> Inside St. Peters Basilica in Vatican City <p> A square in Lucca <h> Where To Find Them ? <p> You can explore churches most anywhere in Italy , but Rome is definitely where its at . I spent an entire day church hopping in Rome , which is just about the easiest task when there are over 900 to choose from . Whatever you do , do n't  miss St. Peters Basilica in Vatican City it is completely worth the hype . <h> Italy Has Coastlines <p> Very high on my Italy bucket list was the Amalfi Coast , situated a couple hours south of Rome on the central west side of the country . I spent a few glorious days hiking in the hills and bopping around between Positano , Amalfi , and Atrani , and it was one of the highlights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as beautiful as the photos make it out to be , I promise ! <p> I also popped over to Capri for a day and wandered around this white-washed island . Not surprisingly , I enjoyed my peaceful coastal walk more than my jaunt through the boutique-laden Capri Town . <h> Where To Find Them ? <p> The Amalfi Coast and the island of Capri were my Italian coastlines of choice , but the Cinque Terre in the north is equally stunning . For more off-the-beaten-path coastal excursions , venture out to the east coast to Puglia and Basilicata . <h> Italy Has Bridges <p> GASP OF ALL GASPS , Lindsay went chasing bridges on a trip . It may not have been with the same level of enthusiasm I had checking out bridges in New York or London , but I quite enjoyed it in Italy as well . <p> A bridge in Milan <p> The Arno in Florence <p> Ponte Vecchio in Florence <h> Where To Find Them ? <p> Any cities with canals and rivers winding through them are bound to have bridges . Those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss the famous Ponte Vecchio in Florence , where you can do some shopping while crossing the bridge ! <h> Italy Has Mountains <p> Before traveling in Italy , mountains never came to mind at the mention of this country . Little did I know that northern Italy is quite a mountainous region , which actually makes sense given its close proximity to the Alps . <p> I flew in and out of Milan , which meant I bookended my trip with jaunts in the north of the country . At the start of my trip , I spent a couple days at Lake Como taking in the glorious mountain views and wondering if George Clooney was hiding out in his lakeside villa at the same time . Then at the tail end of my trip , I booked a room in a rustic B&amp;B and did some hiking in Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso . I spent one of my last days schlepping to the French border , where I took a cable car up as close as I could get to Mont Blanc . <p> Lake Como <p> Parco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cable car up to Mont Blanc <p> Mont Blanc <h> Where To Find Them ? <p> Italys mountains can be found in the north , close to the borders of France and Switzerland where the Alps start .

GET PSYCHED ! <p> First , let 's talk logistics . Stopovers are a frugal frolickers best friend . Someday I want to write in more detail about the value of stopovers and open jaw flights , but in short : I try to take advantage of these whenever possible . Case in point , I changed my flight home from Asia so that I could stop over in London before I landed in New York .

You have panoramic views of the river , where you can watch longtail boats and barges make their way and observe the stilt structures across the river ( some are still homes , others are ferry landings or restaurants ) . <p> The details on Wat Arun are just mesmerizing .

Its almost pointless to say that because really , we have zero control over what the weather ends up doing . If nothing else , just make sure you set expectations accordingly depending on what time of year you visit New Zealand . <p> You 're pretty much guaranteed to spot seals hanging out on the rocks in Milford Sound . Dolphins are also known to frequent the waters here , but not quite so often . If you 've ever been in close proximity to these guys , you know that seals absolutely STINK . So , you know , maybe breathe out of your mouth when you pass by them . <p> When you first set out into the sound , there 's a big waterfall you can glimpse from afar , toward the right . On our way back to the terminal , we got up close to it . I love how it looks completely different from every angle . <h> Thank you to Air Wakatipu for hooking me up with the incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> I use a Canon 5dIII with the 16-25 and 70-200/2.8 lenses .

@@118792753 @7792753/ <h> Koh Rong , But So Right Island Paradise in Cambodia <p> This probably sounds bad , but I only went to Cambodia to kill time until my broken camera was fixed . While I was in Bangkok , Canon told me they 'd likely complete the repair in 1-2 weeks , so I figured it made the most sense to hop over to Cambodia , loop through Siem Reap Phnom Penh Sihanoukville , and then back around through Thailand and into Bangkok . <p> Right around the one-week mark , I was in Sihanoukville when I got the dreaded e-mail from Canon telling me they 'd found ANOTHER problem with my camera , and that it 'd take an additional 3 weeks to repair . OH GREAT ! Why could n't they have told me this from the start ? ! <p> Near tears and without a clue as to how to proceed with my trip , I made a most-excellent decision : F*** it , I 'm going to an island ! And that is how I unexpectedly came to find my ultimate island paradise on Koh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southeast Asia <p> I 'm gon na go ahead and state my claim that Koh Rong is the best island in Southeast Asia . It 's also one of the most underrated islands but maybe that 's part of the reason why I loved it so much . There 's something immensely satisfying about feeling like you 're one of the lucky few who have discovered a slice of heaven . <h> Koh Rong Beaches <p> The beaches on Koh Rong are absolutely stunning . I 'm talking , they should have a place in the dictionary when you look up the word paradise ' . You could stay on the main beach and be perfectly content there , but there are other beaches connected via a footpath northward that are also worthy of exploration . <p> The next beach up is small and , unlike its neighbors , has golden sand . It 's also home to the Tree Top Bungalows , so odds are you 'll encounter those folks hanging out here . <p> If you continue up the path a bit further , you 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be many others here and even if there are , the beach is so big that you can easily escape them . Towards the northern end of the beach is another resort with pricey food and drinks . <p> A word of caution : the sand flies are absolute bitches on Koh Rong . I would highly advise against laying in the sand at all , even on a towel those buggers will get you ! There are some rickety beach loungers you can lay on near some of the resorts . <h> Hiking on Koh Rong <p> There is an oft-talked about jungle trek from the main beach on the eastern side of Koh Rong to Long Beach on the western side . We were advised to follow the splotches of red paint and mounted sandals as trail markers . It 's a fairly straight-forward hike , but do n't be fooled into thinking it 's a walk in the park . First : IT 'S HOT . I had literal streams of sweat dripping off my body and I was just in my bathing suit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock scramble . I would not advise doing it in sandals . <p> But oh , is it worth it . Long Beach is simply gorgeous . There is nothing there other than a low key resort and a couple of long tail boats . You can frolic in the warm shallow waters , lay in a hammock , or stroll down the expansive beach . And as it faces westward , Long Beach is primed for sunset viewing . A few long tail boats scooped all of us up just before sunset and slowly took us back to the other side of the island . We watched as the sky exploded on our journey back : <h> Kayaking at Koh Rong <p> You can rent a single or double kayak on Koh Rong and paddle around the island , though the current can make for an exhausting paddle at times . We paddled out to a little island nearby , then to another beach before heading back . To be honest , kayaking is not a must-do as you can access other beaches on foot , but it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on Koh Rong <p> When I was n't on the beach , I was escaping the sun and/or grabbing a drink with new friends at Coco 's . Coco 's was one of the few spots on the island with wifi , with an added bonus of comfy seating and good happy hour specials . Hanging out at Coco 's became a part of my daily routine on Koh Rong . <h> Phosphorescent Plankton at Koh Rong <p> Like at Maya Bay , you can also see phosphorescent plankton on Koh Rong . For maximum plankton viewing , head out to the darkest part of the beach at night and go into the water til you 're about 4 feet deep in it . Then kick , punch , and twirl in the water to see the plankton glow . <p> I 'm still not over this scene . Picture being submerged in warm water with glowing plankton , looking up at the most star-studded sky imagineable , and being able to see a crazy thunderstorm happening back on the mainland . I think this might have been the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Koh Rong Accommodation Tips <h> Do n't  book accommodation in advance ! <p> Many guesthouses do n't even take bookings , so you can literally just step off the ferry and check out the various places with signs advertising rooms available . You 'll find a few hostels , many restaurants and bars doubling as guesthouses , and some bungalow resorts . Guesthouses are far and away the best value for money here . <h> Skip the hostels <p> There is only one hostel on Koh Rong with an online presence , though there are a few others on the island with beds for $8/night . The problem I kept running into with these hostels was a lack of security . None of them had lockers available , nor were you able to lock your dorm room , so you 'd have to leave any valuables with the staff . When you 're traveling with a whole backpack full of valuable electronics , there 's clearly no way it 's all going to fit in a tiny safe at reception . I was n't about to leave my valuables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to look for a single room at some other guesthouse . For just $2 more a night , I had my own room with a balcony and hammock to enjoy . Totally worth it ! <h> You will not sleep well <p> This is a sweeping generalization ( as I obviously have n't experienced all accommodation options on Koh Rong ) , but should ring true if you 're staying in the main cluster of accommodation on the island . <p> It 's hot . Most rooms do not have fans , so you 're reliant on the sea breeze to cool you off at night ( and FYI it does n't ) . <p> It 's noisy . You will hear music and chatter from nearby bars at night , and construction work by locals early in the morning . <p> But hey , what does it matter when you 're just going to fall asleep on the beach the next day anyway ? Might as well just sleep in your underwear and earplugs and get whatever sleep you can manage ! <h> Koh Rong Samloem <p> Koh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samloem , accessible by ferry from Koh Rong . I was more than content to spend all of my time on Koh Rong , but I also did n't mind venturing to what others say is actually the more paradisal of the two islands . <p> The ferry from Koh Rong dropped us off at the fishing village on Koh Rong Samloem , and as we walked through it , the locals directed us toward some accommodation ( possibly THE only accommodation around these parts ) . While it was n't quite paradise , it was a really nice escape for a couple days . ( After the fact , we learned that the nicer ' part of the island was a long tail boat trip away from where we had stayed ) . <p> Where we were was quite woodsy and the beach felt more like a lake than the ocean , but I found it a welcome change from typical island paradise . We were in close proximity to the locals as they worked and lazed in the village nearby . Little kids bathed in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hung out on our bungalow porch reading by day and drinking wine by evening , and went to bed by 9pm both nights .

Do you have a contact number for them ? 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Thank you , Charis ! You should DEFINITELY go to Koh Rong ! Itll be the offseason when you 're there , so it should be easy to find a room somewhere . Most places do n't  take bookings in advance ( unless you stay at one of the few resorts there ) . <p> You can literally just hop off the ferry and start walking down the beach looking for rooms being advertised most restaurants/bars will offer rooms . To find Bamboo , hang a right off the ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes further on the left you should see it I believe its right next to a backpacker bar . You 'll see Koh Rong Backpackers on the pier just a tad further ( do NOT stay with them , whatever you do ! ) . <p> Let me know if you have more questions ! Happy to talk up one of my favorite spots in all of Southeast Asia : D <p> Ed <p> Wow Lindsay , beautiful photos . Did your camera finally get fixed ? We will be in Cambodia next June/July and hope to go to Koh Rong . Is that considered off season ? We are hoping to find accommodations after we arrive instead of booking ahead .

I was on the island in early May and it did n't  rain much at all , though while I was on the mainland it rained most every day . BUT , the nice thing is that its always short bursts of rain , so its not likely that your days will be completely rained out . <p> YES ! ! So excited that someone else shares my love for Koh Rong !

Assuming you gushed about this island as well , Im about to go stalk your blog ! : P <p> Sebastien G Dit Beaver <p> dear lindsay , thanks for this article , amazing one .

You know , that 's a good question I did n't  go to the nicer part of Koh Rong Samloem , but if I had it may have been my favorite . You really cant go wrong with Koh Rong ( wrong , rong , hah ! ) it was n't so much a party scene , definitely nowhere near how Sihanoukville or some of the Thai islands are . You should definitely make a trip out there ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Great question ! I basically just did n't  lie on the beach much . I found this one big rock on the end of the main beach which I was able to sit on without being bothered by them . Other than that , I 'd recommend sitting on a towel in the sand rather than laying on it . Kinda sucks , but worth it to live in paradise ! <p> oneworld <p> Do you know if its still really rainy in mid-September to mid-October ? I cant figure out if the rain peaks or starts to peter out during this time 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by then . When I was there in May , sporadic heavy rains were common in Cambodia but they would n't last long at all , so even if it did rain I do n't  think it would hinder your travel plans ! <p> You 're so welcome !

@@118792755 @7792755/ <h> Scenes From The Road in Iceland <p> I recently spent 8 days driving around Iceland . Or , more accurately , being driven around Iceland by my friends whose driving skills are far superior to mine . No , instead of driving , I bring a random smattering of other useful skills to roadtrips : researching awesome and preferably offbeat stops along the way , negotiating discounts , frantically phoning guesthouses late at night to inquire whether they have an available room at an affordable price , crafting playlists of the cheesy pop and/or classic rock persuasion , getting un-lost after a wrong turn or three , finding backcountry campsites . <p> And most importantly : taking kickass photos . <p> You know how it is when you see something so beautiful you ca n't help but stare ? Ca n't help but wonder if it 's a dream ? That 's Iceland that 's ALL of Iceland . I took hundreds of photos of the passing scenery from the car windows in an attempt to prove that what we were seeing was real . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , and other Icelandic attractions along the way , but even if you did n't if you just went to Iceland and all you did was drive around you 'd still see some ridiculously beautiful things . <p> The photos below were taken either from or within 20 feet of our car while driving on the Ring Road and other side streets in Iceland ( clockwise heading north from Reykjavik ) <h> The Westfjords <h> North Iceland <h> East Iceland <h> South Iceland <h> Which region in Iceland has the prettiest scenery ? 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Great question ! It really depends on your travel style . If you camp , $0-10/night for the campsite ; a hostel dorm bed is $30-40 . Meals are very expensive no matter where you go , but if you buy groceries and cook for yourself you can save a lot of money . Car rental is pretty expensive as well , but can be made more affordable if you split it with others . <p> I might get into specifics of what I paid for this trip in a future blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will be traveling to Iceland this August for 2 weeks . Did you find it helpful to pre-book accommodation while driving around the island ? Or did you just stop when you felt like you did n't  want to drive any further and find a place to stay ? We plan to bring a tent but I 'm sure I 'll want to stay in actual hotels/hostels or an AirBnB a few of the nights . <p> Great question ! We only prebooked our accom in Reykjavik and on the Laugavegur Trek . We had planned to just pull over and camp whenever we felt like it while driving around on the other days , but sometimes it was a bit tricky to find a suitable spot or contend with the rain , so then we ended up wasting time driving around looking for a place to stop .

@@118792758 @7792758/ <h> Flying Over Kauai My First Time In A Helicopter ! <p> I cant believe it took me nearly 32 years to take my first helicopter flight ! - I 've been lucky enough to take a few scenic flights during my travels ( over the Grand Canyon , Great Barrier Reef , and Milford Sound ) but those were all in small planes . <p> The fact is , scenic flights by helicopter are more expensive than those by airplane . And you know how this frugal gal rolls why would I pay more for something when I can get basically the same thing- paying less ? I mean , if a plane and a chopper are covering the same route , you 're gon na see approximately the same sights on either flight , right ? That was my reasoning , anyway . <p> But you might- also know that I prescribe to the *do the thing you 're supposed to do , in the place you 're supposed to do it* mentality . So when I realized that scenic helicopter tours were a major thing on Kauai , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my helicopter cherry . <p> And guys , it was SO worth the wait . Kauai was- made- to be to toured- in a helicopter . There 's just so much beautiful stuff to be seen from above that you ca n't glimpse from the ground . <p> Scenic flights by airplane are offered too , but planes cant get as close to the waterfalls or enter the valleys like helicopters can . And trust me , you 're gon na want to get up close to Kauais natural wonders . <p> Our 50 minute flight with Blue Hawaiian- began in Lihue and headed westward to circle the island clockwise . This is the standard flight path for helicopters , which means that you 'll predictably see them passing by overhead all day long , wherever you are on the island. - Our pilot informed us that all of the scenic flight operators stagger their take-offs so that you are n't  too close to any other aircraft . It felt like we were the only ones around but then again , its entirely possible I was just so entranced by the scenery that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame me ? <p> Kauai is nicknamed The Garden Isle , but personally I think it would be better suited as The Waterfall Isle . Most of the falls you cant even access on foot because they 're nestled in the mountainous jungle . The only way to see them is to fly over them . <p> I 'm prone to sporadic motion sickness , which basically means that sometimes I feel completely normal in a moving vehicle or vessel , and other times I feel extremely nauseous . There does n't  seem to be much rhyme or reason as to when it hits me . <p> I had packed some ginger tablets with me on my Kauai trip but of course they were nowhere to be found when I was frantically searching for them while parked in the Blue Hawaiian parking lot . I probably should have spent a little more time looking because YUP , the motion sickness monster ripped me a new one . Thankfully I did n't  actually get sick , but I was pretty out of it for most of the flight . Another woman in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one suffering . <p> We think it was the constant circling and turning around the chopper did so that passengers on both sides could enjoy the same view. - Great in theory , because what 's worse than being on the wrong side of the plane when flying over some miraculous landscape ? But not great when all that circular motion triggers nausea , as it tends to do for me . <p> Waimea Canyon : - The Grand Canyon of the Pacific . I can totally vouch for this claim now that I 've witnessed this stunner from both the air and the canyon rim . <p> A- wide angle lens is key for this portion of the flight . I did n't  get too many shots of it because I did n't  have a window seat and could n't get close enough to the window to take- them with my 16-35mm lens ( and also because I was feeling the worst of the motion sickness , ugh ) . <p> Blue Hawaiians helicopters seat 6 passengers : 2 in the front ( aka best views ) and 4 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple " , and assign seats based on weight . Ours were in the back-right of the chopper . <p> I let Anna have the window seat because she would n't have been able to get many shots with her phone otherwise , and figured I would take most of mine with my 70-200mm zoom lens which would actually work better with more distance- from the window . The zoom lens was perfect for capturing those up-close waterfall shots and coastal views , but I think Waimea Canyon is better suited for a wide angle lens . <p> And then , the most highly anticipated part of the Kauai scenic flight : the Na Pali Coast . Oh my sweet baby Jesus , this coastline is breathtaking . <p> THIS is why you book a Kauai helicopter tour . <p> I was particularly excited to see the Kalalau Trail from above , as I 'd be starting the trek in just a few days time . See the beach in the photo below ? Thats Kalalau Beach , where I 'd soon be camping and frolicking . The coastline north of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ridges and took us into the valley , where we got super close to a waterfall and spotted some goats amongst the ridges . I have minimal photos from this part- because all the manoeuvring and turning made me feel sick . <p> From there , we turned and flew along the North Shore and then headed back inland to Lihue . I think this coastline would have been far more epic on a sunny day where the water would have been bright blue , but honestly : I was too dizzy to enjoy it anyway . <p> One thing I will say is that it did feel a bit like we were on a conveyor belt throughout the whole experience with Blue Hawaiian . They were constantly having us move here or stand there and it felt very formulaic and impersonal . I guess it works well when you have a large volume of customers coming through got ta be a well-oiled machine to make it work ! But I feel like they could make more of an effort to make their customers feel special . Isnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received any email after we booked to confirm what time our flight was . We got the receipt just after booking , but nothing after that with further details after wed stated our preference for an afternoon flight . So having to chase that information down a few days beforehand was kind of annoying . <p> Note : I paid full price for my helicopter tour and was under no obligation to review my experience , but as always I wanted to be honest about it . 205739 @qwx1065739 <h> As of December 2016 <p> The Kauai ECO Adventure helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian costs $217 if you book it online at least 5 days in advance ; $246 otherwise . 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Ohhhhh you totally should !

@@118792759 @7792759/ <h> Everything You Want To Know About Hiking The Kalalau Trail <p> The Kalalau Trail is exhilarating , exhausting , terrifying , drop-dead stunning , and positively one of the best hikes you could ever hope to embark on . <p> I tend to operate on a *throw myself into it and see what happens* basis , often without pausing to consider whether I can actually succeed ( after all , whatever happens , I can handle it ) . But honestly ? Even with all my research , I had some serious concerns about tackling the Kalalau Trail . The Internet failed my frantic and very specific Google queries about car break-ins and trail safety and I went into this trek with all sorts of trepidation . <p> I do n't want you to be filled with dread and second guess your decision to hike to Kalalau like I did , so here is the guide I wish I 'd had beforehand for you , my friends ! <h> Getting to the Kalalau Trailhead <p> The easiest thing to do is rent a car and drive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ( route 560 ) . It 's also the riskiest option because break-ins happen semi-frequently with cars left here overnight . If you 're up for chancing it , leave no valuables in your car and lock it . Ask to store your belongings at whatever hotel you stay at before starting the trek so that they 're safe . A lot of sources recommend leaving your car unlocked so that thieves wo n't break any windows if they want to get into your car , but if your car rental company offers coverage for break-ins there 's really no reason not to lock it ( note : I rented a car from Dollar and they covered break-ins ) . There are actually two parking lots by the trailhead and Ke'e Beach : the one right next to it , and another one just a minute down the road at Haena State Park . <p> Alternatively , you can park your car at Haena County Park , which is used for Haena Beach and the Haena Beach Park campground . Because people camp literally right next to the lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This parking lot is about a half hour walk from the trailhead ( or a mile ) . You could always drive to the trailhead , leave your pack , drive back to Haena Beach to park the car , then walk back to the trailhead pack-free . <p> If you do n't have a car , there may be a seasonal North Shore shuttle that runs from Princeville to the Kalalau trailhead ( it only runs during peak summer months and relies on funding ) . If not , you can take the public bus as far as Hanalei and try hitching a ride to the trailhead . <h> How Many Nights For The Kalalau Trail ? <p> Short answer : as many as you can manage ! <p> I would say 3 nights is the absolute minimum to allow for the Kalalau Trail , but you will want more once you reach Kalalau Beach trust me on this one . This is definitely a hike to be savored , not one to rush through for bragging rights . <p> If you are a very fit person and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire 11 miles in one day . For everyone else , it 's smart to break the walk in half and camp at Hanakoa on the way to/from Kalalau especially if you 're hiking in winter when the trail tends to be wet and slow-going . <p> Personally , I had 4 days and 3 nights for the hike . I took 2 days to hike in because I got a late start on Day 1 and could n't make it to Kalalau before dark . I had just under 24 hours at Kalalau Beach which I felt was sufficient to soak up the vibes , but not long enough to fully relax or explore the valley . I also took 2 days to hike out because I did n't want to put myself through the mentally exhausting cliff scramble and the physically exhausting mud trudging in the same day ( FYI the former is during miles 7-9 , the latter during miles 1-6 ) . <h> Do They Check Permits On The Kalalau Trail ? <p> Maybe occasionally ? Word is that they may be more strict about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many people who could n't get permits risk it and hike anyway . But during off peak times , it 's less likely anyone will check for permits . <p> Take that with a grain of salt , though you really never know when the park authorities will show up . If you want to play it safe , book your permit far in advance ( like 6 months in advance if you 're hiking during peak time , i.e. summer ) . <p> For what it 's worth , I met several people who either did n't book a permit , only booked their first couple days just to feel it out , or ended up starting a day later than planned and did n't have a permit booked for their last day . Kalalau Trail trekkers tend not to be sticklers for rules here 's hoping that the park authorities are n't either ! <h> When To Hike The Kalalau Trail ? <p> Any time ! Kauai weather is consistently warm year-round . <p> Do note , though , that peak time is summer ( June-August ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booked out many months in advance . <p> Winter ( December-February ) is less crowded , but more rainy . Even if it does n't rain during your trek , you 'll experience mud in every possible consistency , which can really slow you down . <p> Be sure to check the weather forecast once you arrive on Kauai and make sure you have a plan in the event that it rains ( whether that means buying rain gear , postponing your trek , or backing out altogether ) . Check the State Parks website the morning you 're due to start trekking to ensure the trail has n't been temporarily closed due to flash flooding . <h> What 's The Kalalau Trail Like ? <p> Unbelievably awesome ! <p> The Kalalau Trail has 3 main landmarks / stopping points / segments : <h> Trailhead to Hanakapi'ai Beach ( Mile 0-2 ) <p> A popular day hike suitable for any level hiker , this segment of the trail is slippery and muddy ( particularly in winter ) . The second mile is a steep downhill walk to the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast along the way . <p> Right before you reach the beach , you 'll cross Hanakapi'ai Stream . This is the stream everyone says not to cross if the water is too high or flowing too fast ( seriously , people have died here it can be dangerous ! ) . As long as the water is n't above your knees , you should be fine to cross . Plus , there will likely be several other trekkers or day hikers on the trail with you , so if in doubt watch them cross first and then follow . <p> Hanakapi'ai Beach is lovely but not safe for swimming . It 's not a designated campsite , but people do ( illegally ) camp here . <p> Hanakapi'ai Falls is a 2-mile side trip from here a great add-on for a day hike , but probably not worth it if you 're going the full 11 miles to Kalalau as there are more ( easily accessible ) waterfalls to be seen further on . <h> Hanakapi'ai to Hanakoa ( Mile 2-6 ) <p> The trail from miles 2-6 runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . It is n't as scenic as the rest of the trail , so for this reason I 'd say that it 's not worth it just to hike to Hanakoa and back . If you do n't have time to hike the full Kalalau Trail , save it for another time and just do the day hike to Hanakapai'ai . <p> Hanakoa campsite sits at the approximate halfway point ( mile 6 ) , but it 's set inland by a stream rather than on a beach i.e. do n't plan to spend any more time than necessary here . There are camping spots and shelters on either side of the stream , which you 'll need to cross 2 segments of to get to the other side ( so leave your boots off after the first one ! ) . <p> Hanakoa Falls is a 15 minute walk from the campsite and generally said to be well worth a look . <h> Hanakoa to Kalalau Beach ( Mile 6-11 ) <p> Do not , under any circumstance , continue on to Kalalau if you are not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you if you 've never carried a heavy pack for multiple days on challenging terrain , or are scared of heights . <p> Leaving Hanakoa , the mud party continues . Then after mile 7 , a whole new party begins one you 'll probably wish you had n't gone to . This is where the scary cliff walking kicks off , which has you quite literally tiptoeing along a ledge where the path is sometimes too narrow to fit two feet side by side and oh yeah , do n't look down because if you misstep , that 's probably where you 'll be heading . <p> I was sweating buckets the entire time it was TERRIFYING . I took it super slow and leaned on the mountain with my inside hand ( do n't grab the rock some pieces are loose ) and held a trekking pole in my other hand , walking one foot in front of the other . The first part is the worst , but there are a few similar harrowing cliff walks in the mile 7-9 area . <p> The second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's mostly dry with only occasional mud , and offers the most sensational coastal views of the entire trek . <p> There is one last stream to cross once you make it down to Kalalau . Head right after crossing and follow the path to the beach . If you were to head left instead , you 'd be going up into Kalalau Valley ( which you should totally explore one day ) . <p> At Kalalau Beach , there are dozens of campsites set in the trees all along the beach . It gets more crowded closer to the waterfall at the other end of the beach . Past the waterfall , there are some caves on the beach where some people ( illegally ) camp . <h> What Are The Campsites Like At Kalalau ? <p> There are two designated campsites on the Kalalau Trail which you need to book a permit for in advance : Hanakoa and Kalalau . Both campsites have compostable toilets , shelters , and easy access to drinking water ( which you must treat before drinking ) . <p> The entirety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set back in the woods , many of which have fire pits . The sites on the far end of the beach , near the waterfall , are the most popular and have the best views of the beach . Many people opt to camp in hammocks rather than tents : you 'll find plenty of trees fit for hammock hanging here . <p> Hammocks at Kalalau Beach . <p> Some people camp in places outside of the designated campsites , such as : <p> The sheltered spots in the bluffs within the 1-2 miles before Kalalau Beach which have amazing views of the coast . <p> Kalalau Valley , where the locals live . <p> I 'm not sure what exactly happens if you get busted camping outside of the designated campsites , so do so at your own risk ! <h> What To Do At Kalalau Beach <p> Kalalau Beach is a stunner . Once the sun pops out over the mountain around noon , it 's prime time for sunbathing and swimming . The surf is strong , but the water is shallow enough that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves crash . <p> During summer , some people like to swim over to the secluded Honopu Beach said to be one of the most beautiful beaches in Hawaii and/or the world . This beach is only accessible by swimming as boats are not allowed to land here . Be aware that it is not safe to swim to Honopu Beach during winter when the surf is too strong . If you do decide to go , make sure you swim in a group , have fins on , and return to Kalalau before the midday winds pick up . <p> When you need a break from the beach , walk upstream into Kalalau Valley where the locals live . You 'll find clusters of hippie encampments with gardens and intricate tarp-homes along the stream and its tributaries . About 2 miles in , there 's a big ( natural ) pool ideal for swimming . <p> You can also enjoy fresh passionfruit straight from the trees ! <h> Is The Kalalau Trail Safe ? <p> I felt extremely safe the entire time I was on the trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some degree of spiritual this is the sort of person Kalalau attracts . That 's not to say that everyone else feels as safe as I did , but the general consensus seems to be that safety is not an issue . <p> Think about it : this is not a trail that a casual outsider looking to cause trouble would decide to tackle on a whim . Why hike an extremely challenging 11 miles to rob or assault someone when you could achieve the same thing back in civilization with a lot less effort ? <p> Look at how narrow the trail gets ! <h> Can You Hike The Kalalau Trail Solo ? <p> Technically , yes I hiked it alone ! <p> However , I do not recommend hiking the Kalalau Trail by yourself . While the trail is safe in terms of crime , there are parts of it that are not very safe in terms of terrain . Miles 7-9 in particular have several dicey segments where one misstep could send you careening off the cliff edge . Having a hiking buddy there to spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is invaluable . <p> Had I known how dangerous and scary the Kalalau Trail gets in parts , I probably would n't have hiked it solo . There just is n't enough useful information about the trek online , which is precisely why I created this guide ! <h> Kalalau Trail Packing List <p> If you 've been on a multi-day trek before , then you should have a good idea of what the essential gear is for this endeavor . A comfortable pack and boots , layers , wool socks , rain gear , etc you know the drill . <p> So rather than state the obvious , let me list out the not-so-obvious items that I think you should pack and not pack for the Kalalau Trail : <h> Things To Pack For The Kalalau Trail <p> Wet Wipes With several days worth of mud and sweat on your body and no showers available , wipe down your skin with these and you 'll feel clean(-ish) after a day of hiking . <p> Camelbak Perfect for easy access to your water supply while on the trail without having to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT attempt this trek without these ! They will save your knees on the downhills and keep you balanced while trekking through mud and along the cliff edges . <p> Fire starter Sticks and kindling are often wet from rain , which makes it hard to light a campfire on the trail . A fire starter should do the trick . <p> Either a lightweight tent with a rainfly OR a hammock with a tarp and mosquito net Lots of people opt to sleep in a hammock because it 's a lot less weight to carry in their pack . There are plenty of trees at Kalalau Beach fit for hammock hanging . <h> Things NOT To Pack For The Kalalau Trail <p> Sleeping bag It does n't get too cold at night on the trail ( upper-50 's at the lowest ) , so instead of a sleeping bag consider buying a cheap sheet and fleece blanket ( $20 total at Walmart ) or just wear extra layers . <p> Sunglasses You 'll keep taking them off when trekking in the shade and then they 'll get all foggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat instead , if anything . <p> Bathing suit Why bother when you can just wear your sweaty hiking outfit and rinse it off in the sea or stream , or go skinnydipping as all the hippies there do ? <p> Lots of water You do n't need to pack much water , as there are plenty of streams and waterfalls from which to refill your bottle or bladder along the way . <p> You do n't have to bring absolutely everything from home , though : most everything you need can be bought at Walmart in Lihue for super cheap . Alternatively , you can rent gear from Kayak Kauai . <h> What other questions do you have about the Kalalau Trail ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <h> As of December 2016 <p> Permits for the Kalalau Trail cost $20/person per night and must be obtained in advance of hiking . If you 're planning on hiking during peak summer months , book your permit several months in advance . Permits can be reserved online here . <p> Its very hard to predict the weather on the trail , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Shore but you can monitor this weather site for an approximate forecast . <p> Check the DLNR website before setting out on the Kalalau Trail in case its been closed due to flooding or construction . <p> The Kalalau Trail facebook group is worth joining to ask any questions you may have about the trail , and share your photos and experience from the trail upon your return . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Jill Paget <p> Thank you ! I 'm doing this hike at the end of August . I 'm in good shape , but I 'm still nervous . This is exactly the kind of info Ive been trying to find to help me figure out how to prepare . I REALLY appreciate it ! <p> YAY , I 'm so glad to hear that !

@@118792760 @7792760/ <h> The Best Splurge In Queenstown : Flying to Milford Sound <p> I spent the final week of my recent trip to New Zealand in Queenstown , so-called adventure capital of the world . Its the kind of place that 's stupid-stunning from every angle , which tourism has fully exploited by offering just about every adrenaline-inducing outdoor adventure you can think of . Because really , if you 're going to drop a few hundred dollars throwing yourself off of ledges , bridges , and mountains , you might as well do it in a location as beautiful as this . <p> A surprise to exactly no one who 's been reading this blog for any amount of time , these thrill-seeking activities werent on my New Zealand agenda . Well , paragliding was on my list , but it did n't  happen because I only had a few good weather days to work with and I had other priorities : hiking , biking , and the half-day trip to end all half-day trips the Milford Sound Fly-Cruise-Fly package . <p> For what will indubitably be 4 of the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can fly from Queenstown to Milford Sound , do the classic cruise around the fjord at Milford , and hop back on the plane back to Queenstown . <p> Or , you can drive from Queenstown to Milford Sound in the same amount of time that all of the above awesomeness takes to complete then do the cruise and make the 4 hour drive back to QT . <p> I do n't  know about you , but one of these options sounds infinitely more epic to me . <p> And so , on the only clear blue sky day I had my entire 3 weeks in New Zealand , I flew from Queenstown to Milford Sound with Air Wakatipu . One thing I really liked was that afterwards , they sent us the GPS map from our flight , outlining the exact route we took to Milford and back ( which we flew counter-clockwise ) . Its like they knew it would come in handy for blog posts like this ! ; ) <p> Queenstown and Milford look not-too-far apart on the map , but there is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes , and other scenic phenomena that stand " in the way " . Furthermore , Milford is n't along the road to any other attraction really , so no matter where you 're driving from you 're going well out of your way to get there and then have to return the way you came . <p> If you have limited time on your New Zealand trip , it makes so much more sense to fly instead and save yourself a half day of travel . Heck , even if you do have the luxury of time like I did , you wont regret flying to Milford . The views look a liiiiiiiiittle something like this : <p> These were the only snow-capped mountains I glimpsed from the plane , just northwest of Queenstown toward Mt . Aspiring . If you fly from late-autumn to early summer , you 're likely to see many more snowy peaks on your scenic flight . There was n't much residual snow in April when I was there . <p> One really awesome ( but also frustrating ) thing about this scenic flight to Milford is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . Our pilot would point out some crazy electric-blue lakes on the other side that I could barely see , but then we 'd fly by other cool things like heart-shaped lakes on my side that the left siders probably could n't see . No matter which side of the plane you 're on , you 're gon na see some pretty spectacular scenes out your window . <p> This trio of different-colored lakes looks like something youd see on the Tongariro Crossing on the north island . Really though , how does this exist ? How can one lake be emerald green while another one nearby is a milky blue ? Mind : blown . <p> I was happy to be on the right side of the plane when we reached the west coast . Check out this sun-drenched view of the northern reaches of Fiordland National Park ! <p> Then we turned south to enter Milford Sound , absorbing a completely different view of the fjords to the south and the little beaches along the coast . <p> Entering Milford Sound was like a dream ( come true ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soaring between the fjord walls and closing in on the landing strip as we touched down . <p> We took a different route back to Queenstown that provided drastically different scenery to what we had witnessed on the way down to Milford . We right siders were treated to sweeping views of Lake Te Anau , the south islands largest lake . If you 're driving to Fiordland National Park , the town of Te Anau ( on the southern tip of this lake ) is the jumping-off point to both Milford and Doubtful Sound . <p> This time , we flew right over Lake Wakatipu before landing in Queenstown . I was especially eager to see this lake from a different vantage point , as most of the walks and viewpoints in town yield approximately the same ( but beautiful ) view from above . <p> Mountains and valleys , rivers and lakes : I 'd say that sums up Queenstown and the surrounding area to a T. <p> All of these photos were taken with my 70-200mm lens ( except for the very first one , which I shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do get pretty close to some of the peaks , having a big zoom lens allows you to hone in on details , like where the mountains meet the lake . But more importantly , its trickier to avoid the parts of the plane and the glare on the windows unless you can zoom through them . For that reason , I would make sure you 're shooting at at least 50mm ( on a full frame camera ) . If you do n't  know what any of that means , you 're probably fine if you have a camera that zooms . <p> In the spirit of full disclosure , the rad guys at Air Wakatipu let me fly with them for free on standby . I was fully ready to plunk down NZ$489 had I not been able to get onto one of these flights , and I can assure you it is 100% worth the money . <p> The Milford Fly-Cruise-Fly package is an awesome option if you 're short on time on your New Zealand trip and have your heart set on making it to Milford Sound . Combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most scenic flights you could possibly do in the whole world and I 'd say I 'm pretty justified in asserting that of all the fun , exciting , and wallet-draining things you can book , this is far and away the best value activity in Queenstown . <h> Thank you to Air Wakatipu for hooking me up with a incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Hey Juliana ! I would definitely recommend early morning . My flight was around noon and it was really bright not super ideal for photos . 4pm could work too , depending on the time of year ( i.e. if its summer and sunset is at 10pm , itll probably still be pretty bright ) .

@@118792761 @7792761/ <h> Sydney Coastal Walk : Kurnell to Cronulla + Botany Bay NP <p> Cronulla might just be Sydney 's most underrated ocean beach . It does n't have the glitz of Bondi or the dramatic ferry commute of Manly , but let me tell you what it does- have : 6- km of gorgeous , flat , mostly undeveloped sand that you can easily have to yourself if you go far enough out . It 's also one of Sydney 's best surf spots ( better than Bondi , I 've heard ) . <p> Its location , I think , is mostly to blame . Cronulla is a fair distance from Sydney city and takes about an hour to get to by train . With so many other glorious beaches around that are quicker to get to , it 's no wonder why many people ( myself included ) skip Cronulla in favor of other Sydney sands . <p> Those clouds , though ! <p> I recently got to right my wrong with my inaugural trip down to Cronulla . Technically I 've been to Cronulla twice before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coastal Track nearby . This time , I was there to take on a different Sydney coastal walk : from Kurnell , through Botany Bay National Park , to Cronulla . <p> Though much of the trail was unmarked or flooded with mud puddles , I had a blast on this offbeat adventure ! I 'm not sure if the trail conditions were primarily due to it being winter , but if you 're a hiker who prefers to follow clearly defined trails and/or keep your boots dry , you may want to give this Sydney coastal walk a miss ( or perhaps attempt it in summer ) . <p> Here 's what you can expect if you do the Kurnell to Cronulla coastal walk . <p> I 'd recommend starting the walk in the north at Kurnell that way you can relax on Cronulla Beach afterwards or grab some food in town . <p> Catch the 987 bus from Cronulla Station and hop out at the- Kurnell Reserve Captain Cooks Landing stop- about 20 minutes later . You can follow the Monument Track along the south coast of Botany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's center . Sydney Airport is on the north coast of Botany Bay , so you 'll see ( and hear ! ) planes constantly coming into the bay to land . <p> From the visitor 's center , there are several short tracks you can take that all lead through the northern part of Botany Bay National Park and end approximately at Cape Solander . It does n't really matter which one you choose they 're all just quick bushwalks meant to deposit you on the coastline , i.e. the main attraction . <p> Cape Solander is where the real hike starts ! This is where you 'll first get onto that smooth , sprawling rock that stretches down the coastline . It 's also a good place to do some whale watching in winter I walked by a tally board manned by some volunteers with binoculars and the humpback whale sighting tally was well over 1000 for the season . I saw several whales myself along the track , but they were quite a distance away ( so no decent photos , sorrrrrrrry ! ) . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Botany Bay National Park , it looks like much of it runs slightly inland . However , the tactic I employed was to walk on rock along the coast and cliffs until I could n't go any further , then look for a path around that led inland and follow it until I could get back out onto the rock . <p> I 'd recommend embracing this strategy not just to maximize your coastal views , but also because the trail is n't always obvious or even passable . It looked like some parts of the trail were under construction when I was there during winter , with big planks laid across the path or other equipment nearby that I could only assume would eventually be use to build up the trail . <p> And then there were the puddles oh lord , the puddles ! Even out on the exposed rock there were loads of puddles , despite there not having been any big rains recently . It was far worse on the dirt trails inland , where sometimes the only option was to walk straight through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal for walking in sneakers/runners , but I was oh-so-grateful to have accidentally over prepared and worn my new Merrell shoes . The Gore-Tex in them kept my feet mostly dry through all the puddle jumping I did . <p> I have n't done this walk outside of winter , but my guess would be that puddles are n't as much of an issue during hotter months where a ) . it does n't rain as much , and b ) . when it does , the water dries up faster . Definitely something worth keeping in mind if you do n't like getting wet and dirty , or are n't equipped with sturdy waterproof footwear . <p> One cool landmark , and the approximate halfway point of the hike , is the Cape Baily Lighthouse . I thought there might be some trail leading to ( or at least closer to ) it , but I skipped the puddle jumping that would have been required and walked along the coastal rock instead . <p> And WOW , the rock has some incredible texture to it out here ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into view once you get to the southern reaches of Botany Bay NP . The coastal rock soon gives way to surf and sand as you make your way toward the beach . I started out by walking along the rocks where surfers were getting into the water , but it appeared to taper off in the distance so I took that as my cue to climb up to the path above the beach ( if you look at Google Maps , this is approximately around Doughboy Head yes , apparently that 's the name ! ) . <p> This sand and dirt-laden path provides a lovely view of the water from above , particularly as you round the bend toward Boat Harbour . Look at all that blue ! Can you believe this is what winter in Sydney looks like ? <p> From Boat Harbour onwards , you 'll be walking on the beach all the way to Cronulla it 's about 1.5 hours worth of beach frolicking . Now would be an excellent time to peel off those wet muddy shoes and let your toes touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people can drive out onto the sand and park their vehicles . It would be a fantastic spot to stop on an Australian roadtrip I mean can you imagine parking your campervan approximately right here ? Bliss ! <p> I passed by hardly anyone on the beach as I made my way to Cronulla . I 'm sure this is in part because it was a winter Friday , but mostly I think people tend to stay by the main beach rather than venture north to the undeveloped parts . Smooth untouched sand , killer surf , and planes flying overhead is what I saw instead . No complaints here ! <p> You can end your walk relaxing on one of Cronulla 's beaches or in its ocean pools , or by checking out any of the bars and restaurants in the neighborhood . Sadly I do n't have any establishments to recommend because I had to rush back to the city to tend to the dog I was sitting and unfortunately did n't have time to stop anywhere , but I 'm very eager to return to Cronulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , the Kurnell to Cronulla coastal walk is an excellent choice for those wanting to escape the crowds and enjoy a private slice of Sydney coastline . I found it well worth the long commute and wet feet I endured ! 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> How to get there : To get to Cronulla , take the T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra train to the last stop , Cronulla . The ride takes about 50-55 minutes from Sydneys Central Station . <p> From Cronulla Station , take the 987 bus up to Kurnell and get off at Kurnell Reserve Captain Cooks Landing at the start of the Monument Track . The ride only takes 15-20 minutes , but the bus does not run frequently so you 'll want to consult Trip Planner or Google Maps to make sure the times line up for the train and bus . <p> How much time to allow : From where the bus drops you off in Kurnell back to Cronulla Station , the 13km walk should take 4.5 hours nonstop .

@@118792762 @7792762/ <h> Cycling Angkor Wat Temple Hopping By Bike <p> I love solo travel , and I will happily sing its praises to anyone who will listen . But man , sometimes it 's nice to be able to split the cost of things with traveling companions whether it 's ordering several dishes and sharing them all , affording a 5-star hotel room , or just sharing a cab to the airport . <p> I began my 2-week stint in Cambodia traveling solo , staying in a single room at a guesthouse in Siem Reap . The one thing on my agenda was to explore the temples at Angkor . Only problem ? It costs about $15 to hire a tuk tuk driver for the day to take you around the temple complex . Totally affordable if you 're traveling with a few other people , but an extra $15/day was not in my solo traveler 's budget . <p> So I did what I probably would have done anyway had it only cost me $5 to get around by tuk tuk I hired a bicycle to explore the temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusty little cruiser to take me around town : <p> The Angkor temples are mapped out along 2 main loops : the small loop ( red ) and big loop ( green ) . If you want to venture beyond these , tuk tuk drivers will usually charge more due to the greater distance covered . <p> I bought the 3-day pass and only used it for 2 days : the small loop on Day 1 , and the big loop on Day 2 . I was perfectly content with that , and way too exhausted from 2 full days of cycling in horrendous heat and humidity to seriously consider a third day of it . <h> Cycling Angkor Wat <p> Even though its just one of MANY temples at Angkor , the entire complex is commonly ( and mistakenly ! ) referred to as Angkor Wat . Angkor Wat is one of the largest and best-preserved temples at Angkor , and certainly well deserving of its fame . Here she is ! : <p> In truth , though , I think I liked Bayon more than Angkor Wat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maze of passageways and get your Lara Croft on . Bayon also has several stone faces carved into its towers . They look absolutely MASSIVE in person ! <p> We now interrupt this programming with a sweat-tastic self portrait yes , that 's sweat all over my shirt . I 'd say within the next hour , the entire thing was drenched in sweat . SO GROSS . <p> A few of the temples ( most notably , Ta Prohm ) have trees growing out of them . Evidently they were found and left like that , rather than restored . <p> The big loop is definitely worth doing if you have the time . Some of the temples have been partially restored ; others are mostly in ruins . <p> Preah Khan was one of the most enjoyable temples for me . You can frolic through a long series of connected halls , now in partial ruins , and it hardly feels like you 're in the same temple . <h> Things To Consider Before Cycling Angkor Wat <h> Shop around for $1 bike rentals <p> There are many shops renting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto side streets or check at/near the guesthouses , you can probably find some $1 rentals . I found mine at a tiny shop right across from my guesthouse . <h> Know your route <p> It helps to have at least a vague idea of where you 're headed before venturing out to Angkor . It 's easy enough to take the main road out of town , but the turn-off to Angkor is not clearly labeled . I missed it and entered the complex at a different point where you had to have already purchased your temple pass , meaning I had to backtrack and make a few more wrong turns before finally stumbling upon the proper entrance with a ticket booth . <h> Be wary of the weather <p> Siem Reap and Angkor are HOT . Here and the Mekong Delta region in Vietnam were the most uncomfortably hot and humid places I visited in Southeast Asia ( in April/May ) . Being flat and inland , you wo n't have the blessing of a breeze to periodically cool you off throughout the day . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think twice about cycling around Angkor Wat and the rest of the temples . <p> Another thing to consider is rain . If you 're traveling in Cambodia during the wet season ( June-October ) , you can count on being rained on at some point during the day . It 's brilliant for cooling off from the heat , but not so enjoyable cycling through a torrential downpour . When I got caught in a storm , I hid out under a bridge for about 20 minutes til the rain died down . <h> Bring as much water as you can carry <p> I easily went through 4L of water each day I cycled around Angkor and that 's not including any water I consumed before and after my bike ride . Having a bike basket is super handy for carrying bottles of water ! <h> Beware of the ringworm ! <p> Fun fact:Ringworm is actually NOT a worm , and not caused by a worm in fact , it 's a fungus .

@@118792763 @7792763/ <h> 5 Ways To Chill Out In Rishikesh , India <p> I had every intention of taking advantage of all the adventure activities Rishikesh , India has on offer . Rafting , camping , rappelling , hiking , bungee jumping not to mention , it 's the yoga capital of the WORLD . With a sizable offering of active endeavors , it 's so easy to keep busy there . <p> But during my 5 days in Rishikesh , in uncharacteristic form , I clocked in with a grand total of *zero* of these activities ! All I wanted to do was decompress after a week of pure chaos in Rajasthan . So I chilled out . I fell into a routine of sleeping 10 hours a night , maybe starting off my day with a yoga class if I woke up in time , having a leisurely brunch with new friends , and then wandering around all afternoon . <p> RIshikesh was a breath of fresh air literally and figuratively . There , I was able to soak up the beautiful scenery and rejuvenate myself before continuing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mood to relax and take a break from adventure travel , here are 5 ways to chill out in Rishikesh : <h> 1 . Yoga , yoga , yoga <p> Rishikesh is practically synonymous with yoga . You ca n't walk down a single street without being bombarded with signs for yoga classes . Hatha yoga is the traditional form practiced in India , but others such as iyengar and ashtanga yoga are also on offer . Normally classes are held around 8:30am and 5:00pm every day and are 1.5 hours long ( and often they run over , so they end up being nearly 2 hours long ) . <p> If you 're a beginner or a casual yoga do-er , you 'd probably be fine dropping in on any beginner or open level yoga class . If you 're more serious about your practice , your best bet is to talk to other travelers ( ideally those who are in Rishikesh for weeks practicing yoga there are MANY who do just this ! ) and see if they can recommend any good classes in town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class super early to ensure your spot ! <h> 1b . Meditate <p> Almost as prevalent as yoga classes , you can complement your yoga routine with some meditation classes in Rishikesh . ( I did not take any meditation classes , so I ca n't speak much to them ! ) <h> 2 . Cafe Hopping <p> Cafe hopping is one of my favorite activities in general , so I 'm always looking to practice it whenever I travel . Rishikesh has all sorts of cafes set along the river , so you could hop around to several different ones and sample the varying drinks and views of the Ganges . Most of them even have free wifi , which was perfect for getting work done ( i.e. writing for this blog ! ) . <p> My favorite cafes were located on the south side of Laxman Jhula ( the middle of the 3 neighborhoods ' in Rishikesh ) : <p> Paradise Cafe ( pictured below ) has THE BEST view of the Ganges on a platform overlooking the river and bridge . I would sit here for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amazing view . <p> Pyramid Cafe has really cheap and delicious organic food ( and much of it is non-Indian ! ) . It 's set in the hills above the main road , but definitely worth the uphill trek . <p> Pumpernickle Bakery I was lured here by the amazing ( ly cheap ) baked goods on display in the entrance , and they definitely did n't disappoint ! There 's also a nice space inside to hang out and read , plus a balcony overlooking the Ganges . <h> 3 . Go to the Ganges <p> The Ganges is the focal point of Rishikesh . If you do n't go *in* it , at least get as close as you can to it ! For an up close and personal experience , you can swim or bathe in the river ( though if you 're a woman , it 's probably not a good idea ) , or go rafting . Rafting trips run constantly each day from sunrise to sunset and vary in length and grade . The quick and easy raft rides just take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafting trips are advertised all over the place in town , so you 'll have no trouble booking one . You can either book just the rafting , or a combination of rafting and **25;97;TOOLONG . <p> Alternatively , if you do n't feel like getting wet , there is a stretch of rocky beach just north of Ram Jhula ( south side ) . I spent most evenings sitting on the rocks , dipping my feet in the river and reading a book until sunset . Throw in some beautiful golden sunlight and some acoustic guitar , and it 's the perfect end to an afternoon . <h> 4 . Treat yourself to an Ayurvedic Massage in India <p> Massages in general are a must-do in India ( given the affordability ) , but ayurvedic massages in particular are India 's specialty . Prepare to be slathered in all sorts of scented oils ! The massage itself focuses on repetitive fluid motions that hit the pressure points , incorporating a bit of yoga as well with the bending of your limbs . I paid about $7.50 for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life . <h> 5 . Witness the Puja in Rishikesh <p> Every night just before sunset , there is a ceremony on the Ganges down at Swarg Ashram ( in Ram Jhula ) where people gather on the steps and sing , pray , and chant together . Then right around sunset , some people light a candle and set it down the river as an offering on a little cardboard boat filled with flower petals . It 's best to get there 30-45 minutes before sunset to witness this Indian tradition . <h> What is your favorite way to relax in Rishikesh ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792764 @7792764/ <h> Budget Travel in Colombia : What I Spent <p> I do n't  know if you 've noticed , but money has played a recurring role on this blog since Day 1 . I believe very strongly that money should never keep you from pursuing your travel dreams . You can travel without a lot of money as long as you 're sensible about it : keeping an eye out for flight deals , minimizing splurges , reducing transportation costs by spending more time in fewer locations . If I can save a little money here and there , I 'll make the extra effort to do so . Its like a game ! <p> I played the game exceptionally well this round , though I loosened the purse strings a bit when it came to food and drink . I consider each of my splurges in this arena to be well worth it for the experience , though . Nothing quite hits the spot like a good bottle of red and great ( travel-related ) conversation ! <p> Its worth noting that Colombia is not one of the cheaper countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle . Furthermore , the coast of Colombia is more expensive than the rest of the country . Point is , I could have visited a different South American nation and gotten by on less money than what I spent on this trip . Still , budget travel in Colombia is very doable . Take a look at my expenditure below : <p> Note : As of February 2014 , 2030 COP = $1 US . <h> Flight : $365 <p> Half of what I spent on this entire trip was on the- extremely cheap flight there which was the reason why I traveled to Colombia in the first place . $365 from New York to Cartagena , does it get any better than that ? <h> Transportation : $66 <p> Intercity transportation in Colombia was a bit pricier , but also more comfortable , than I expected . A seat in an air conditioned van from Cartagena to Santa Marta was about $20 one way . <p> By contrast , I found local transportation quite affordable . A cab ride across town in Santa Marta , or from Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bus ride covering the same routes would have been $1-2 . I normally avoid taxis in New York , but it was hard to resist them at such great value in Colombia . <p> Pozo Azul in Minca , Colombia <h> Accommodation : $96 <p> Averaging $12/night for accommodation , sleeping in Colombia hardly broke the bank for us . Heres what I paid : <h> Food/Drink : $184 <p> I averaged $23/day on food and drink , the expense I was most lenient with . Had I skipped a few rounds of Wine Time , I 'd have spent under $20/day but what fun would that have been ? ! No regrets , baby . <p> I took my usual approach to eating while I travel : simple grocery-shopped breakfasts , street food snacks , and a proper dinner out at a restaurant ( sometimes with drinks ) . - I would n't classify Colombian food as one of the highlights of visiting this country , but there are plenty of great restaurants specializing in other cuisines . We ate well in Cartagena , splurging on tapas at El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican feast in Santa Marta . <h> Other : $31 <p> I did n't  do any shopping on this trip , so my miscellaneous expenses were minimal . I paid $19 for a Tayrona National Park pass and $12 for a guided hike in Minca that 's it ! I was willing to shell out more to do some sort of adventure activity in Minca , but supposedly there werent any happening the day we visited . <h> What 's usually your biggest travel expense ? 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Looking forward to digging through the archives , hope you 're well in Australia : ) <p> With positive energy <p> Paz 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Hey thanks , Paz !

It did n't take us long to realize , in the midst of the most glorious of days in Margaret River , that we were pretty much doing all of our favorite C ' things . First of all , is n't it just weird that so many of our favorite things happen to start with the letter C ? And what 's more , what are the odds that they 'd all be crammed into one day of awesome ? <p> Kinda crazy , but we rolled with it . Here 's what our C ' -tastic day in Margaret River entailed : <h> Camping at Wharncliffe Mill <p> I 'm pretty anti-research these days when it comes to trip planning , so most of our Southwest Australia road trip was carried out in a *see what we feel like* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into beforehand was whether there were any unique and/or eco conscious accommodations in Margaret River . It did n't take long for me to stumble upon Wharncliffe Mill , a family run bush camp in the Margaret River forest . They 've got all sorts of accommodation types on offer to suit all budgets , from cabins to dorms to campsites . We got hooked up with a safari tent , complete with beds , lamps , a table , cutlery , and plenty of room for hanging out . My bed even came with a heating pad under the sheets ! <p> All that was just an added bonus to what really sold me on this place , though . First , it 's blessed with a fab location : smack in the middle of the forest , yet a mere 2km from the town center . You do n't even need a car to get there or around . And on the eco-friendly front , they generate their own power and harvest rain water on the old mill there . I always appreciate it when an establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it subtly enough on their website , pamphlets , and signs placed around the property , encouraging guests to mind the environment and conserve whenever possible . <p> We seriously loved camping at Wharncliffe Mill and were super bummed to leave it after just a few days . I 'd definitely allot a minimum of 5 days if you can swing it . <h> Cycling in Margaret River <p> Of top priority to us during our time in Margaret River : CYCLING . We 'd been counting on riding some of the surrounding mountain bike trails , but once we found out a DIY cycling wine tour was totally feasible , that pretty much went out the window . We took the Rails to Trails towards town , which is a lovely wooded bike path that starts from the campground and passes through a forest of tall karri trees , and ended up indulging in coffee and chocolate tastings before we even hit the first vineyard . Adequately fueled with all sorts of energy , we cycled on to 3 wineries for some wine tastings . Part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down empty dirt roads , but in all : it was a beautiful day for cycling , and it hardly mattered what the roads were like . <h> Coffee Tasting in Margaret River <p> We did n't intend to make it to Yahava KoffeeWorks so early on in our bike ride , so I figured I 'd caffeinate myself before we departed . Of course , within an hour of consuming 2 homemade cups of coffee we accidentally stumbled upon this place and as a rule , I never say no to coffee , so we went in for a tasting . We were presented with a tasting menu containing three lists of coffees and were asked to pick one from each to try . Had my head not started spinning after the first tasting , I 'd have drank more of the plunger pots prepared for us ( it kills me to waste coffee ! ) . If you go for a tasting here , make sure your caffeine levels are about 0 so you can fully take advantage of all the delicious coffee you 're offered ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beans get roasted and then walking away with a bag of their Blackgold beans . That smell is SO GOOD I wish I had it bottled up as an air freshener . <h> Chocolate Tasting in Margaret River <p> Conveniently located right next to Yahava is Temper Temper , known to have THE BEST chocolate around Southwest Australia . We were thrilled to find generous samples laid out of some of their more popular chocolate bars . Anna and I may have gone HAM on the peanut butter and caramel milk chocolate bits . I do n't even know how I made it out of there without being tempted by the nutella and chocolate or the 85% Venezuelan dark chocolate bars . They probably would have had me with their sugar free mint chocolate bar had it not been overwhelmingly pricey . <h> Chardonnay in Margaret River <p> I was never a huge fan of Chardonnay before I came to Australia , and I 'm pretty sure it 's because I 'd never tasted a proper oaked Chardonnay . Cheap bottles of Chardonnay are typically unoaked , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 'm frugal , and b ) . My taste in wine is n't that refined ( or so I convinced myself ) . <p> But then when I went wine tasting in Tasmania earlier this year , I learned to appreciate the beauty of a Chardonnay that 's aged in an oak barrel . During my first tasting in the Tamar Valley , I instantly noticed that it 's much creamier than a zesty unoaked Chard . Then , my senses registered the added vanilla and buttery flavors acquired from the oak . WHAT IS THIS GOODNESS ? ! , I exclaimed ( if not to my road trip partner Teresa , then certainly in that big ol ' head of mine ) . From that point on , I 've been mildly obsessed with Australian Chardonnay . <p> Margaret River in Southwestern Australia is known for its fabulous food and wine , so I was pretty confident I 'd be reliving the borderline orgasmic oaked Chardonnay tasting experience in this region . Without fail , each vineyard we visited had both oaked and unoaked Chardonnays available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take one sip of the unoaked , just for comparison 's sake , and toss out the rest ; then I 'd devour the entire sample of oaked Chard til my eyes glazed over and contemplate dropping $50 on a bottle of the stuff . <p> We cycled to 3 different vineyards in Margaret River on this perfect day , and even though Anna and I looked like sweaty broke backpackers unlikely to spend a dime , we were always served with respect and friendliness . Would highly recommend the Chardonnay from all three : <h> Campfire <p> We wrapped up our awesome C-day with a big campfire back at Wharncliffe Mill . The bushcamper in me tried to boil a pot of water on the fire , but Anna thought that was downright silly and showed me up by boiling her pot faster on the stove . Sure it was faster , but was it as exciting and satisfying ? I think not ! <p> I offered to do a mini-photoshoot of all the staff sitting around the campfire ; after that , I had it to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best way to end such a perfect day ! <h> Thank you to Wharncliffe Mill for providing us with accommodation and bikes during our incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Awww loved this .

@@118792773 @7792773/ <h> Kalanggaman : The Most Glorious Sandbar Island In All The Land <p> I know I 'm prone to hyperbolic descriptions of most all beaches and islands Ive written about here , but I need you to believe me when I say that Kalanggaman Island is the most beautiful , magical , heavenly place Ive ever stepped foot on . <p> This little sandbar island is closest to the island of Leyte , but you can also visit it on a day trip from Malapascua Island off of Cebu . I went there for some R&amp;R right after I completed my Advanced Open Water diving course on Malapascua . <p> My dive resort , Evolution , sometimes runs dive trips out there which daytrippers can hop on even if they 're not diving , but since it was the low season they did n't  have any dives scheduled near Kalanggaman . Instead , they made some calls and got me onto another boat heading to Kalanggaman from Bounty Beach , not even a 10 minute walk away from the resort . Too easy ! <p> I was a little concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even as the island came into view , I felt a little underwhelmed by what I was glimpsing from afar . <p> Then as we were about to anchor , Kalanggaman opened for business . HOLY WHITE SAND BEACH ! <p> Really there are n't  any words that can do this place justice , but I will feebly try . <p> The boats anchor right by the sandbar portion of the island , which you 'll see immediately if its low tide . Once the tide comes in it starts to disappear , so better to get out there sooner for your selfie ! You 'll likely have to wait your turn though because Kalanggaman is very popular with the locals and you know how Filipinos feel about their selfies , right ? <p> It was tricky as a solo traveler to get the shot I wanted without the tripod that I forgot to bring along with me . I eventually asked some locals to take some pictures of me on the sandbar , but they took that to mean that they should take turns posing *with me* for photos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before breaking away and insisting that they use my camera to shoot me by myself . <p> Once you get your sandbar selfie , I recommend wading straight out from here into the clearest water you may ever see in your life and doing continuous 360-degree spins to fully take in your incredible surroundings . <p> If the sun gets to be too much for you , you can retreat to the woodsy part of the island and seek refuge under the trees . This is where you 'll be served lunch , which for us was BBQ chicken and rice , aka the standard filipino meal . <p> I probably should have kept out of the sun at this point , but I was a woman with a mission : to spend as much time as possible frolicking in the water and sand of Kalanggaman Island ! Shade is for pansies ! ( And also for smart people who do n't  end up with thoroughly burnt arms and legs at the end of the day like I did yikes ! ) <p> It was totally worth the horrible sunburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we spent in paradise . I 'm still not over the glorious Kalanggaman Island . I mean , woud you be ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of September 2016 From Malapascua Island , the boat trip to Kalanggaman Island costs 1200-1500 PHP ( US$25-31 ) depending on the season , and includes lunch . You can either book with your resort or ask one of the locals on Bounty Beach about booking a trip . Upon arrival , there is a 100 PHP ( US$2 ) admission fee for the island . <p> The trip takes two hours if the waters calm , but longer if the waters choppy ( which it usually is on the way back to Malapascua ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I 'd rather spend as much time as possible frolicking outdoors in a new city , and as little time as possible lazing around indoors at a hotel . And since all I really need is a place to crash , I ca n't be bothered spending any more time or money than necessary booking my accommodation yannowhatimean ? <p> But every once in awhile , its nice to take a break from being a frumpy backpacker on the move and savor some ( modest ) luxuries for a hot second . Whether its a 5-star hotel in Bangkok or a hip hostel slash local hangout in Reykjavik ( keep reading ! ) , I 've periodically enjoyed incorporating the hotel experience in my travels . <p> I knew that after two weeks of camping , trekking , and roadtripping in Iceland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my trip . Pegged on Google as " a trendy hostel housed in an old biscuit factory , " I did n't  even need to click any further to decide that Kex Hostel was where I wanted to stay . <p> And boy , did I choose right . I had a fantastic stay at Kex and it had everything to do with the atmosphere they 've cultivated there . Be still , my Brooklyn hipster heart ! <p> Allow me to illustrate <h> Drinking at Kex Hostel <p> Kex is so hip that its buzzing with locals on weekend nights . How many hostels do you know that are deemed cool by their citys residents ? <p> We could n't help but stop by the hostel bar to grab *a drink* and see what the fuss was about before venturing out on the town . Two rounds , some food , and a Northern Lights show later , and we 'd resigned ourselves to a night at Kex . I was more than happy to spend the evening in a " trendy " yet cozy setting with my friends . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eating at Kex Hostel <p> Clearly I did n't  choose to stay at Kex because I was excited to dine there . But in hindsight maybe I should have , because Kexs in-house restaurant S+mundur + Sparif+tunum was phenomenal . When it became clear that wed be staying for more than just *a drink* , I took a peek at the menu . On the pubtenders recommendation , I ordered the fried spotted catfish with pickled lemons , burned butter , and almonds an artisanal meal if I ever saw one . <p> Now , I have what you might call an unrefined palate . If asked to describe what I 'm eating or drinking , I 'll reply with something on the **26;124;TOOLONG scale . A foodie I am not , that 's for sure . But this much I can say : the fish dish I had at Kex was AMAZING . <p> If you stay at Kex Hostel , I highly recommend shelling out an extra 1450kr ( $12 US ) for the Baxtur breakfast buffet . And if my word is n't good enough for you , then perhaps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day right with a visit to the BAXTUR breakfast buffet in the S+mundur dining area , offering a selection of organic Icelandic jams and domestic cheese on slices of freshly-baked bread as well as our special porridge with your choice of toppings . With the lovely aroma wafting from the oven , it 's just like the good old days when the building was a biscuit factory . <p> The photo below is a very modest representation of the breakfast I enjoyed at Kex Hostel . The fresh bread topped with meat , cheese , and tomato was the showstopper for me , but how can you resist fruit salad and skyr ( yogurt ) served in mason jars ? ! You cant . And why should you have to when its a buffet breakfast ? Might as well grab some biscuits while you 're at it its the hostels namesake , after all . <h> Hanging Out at Kex Hostel <p> By night , Kex is an Icelandic hipster haunt . By contrast , during the day its bright and quiet . There are plenty of nooks to curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler waiting awhile for your ride to the airport ) , from couches and pillowed benches to tables and old school desks . I was so content hanging out there with my laptop in the morning . <p> Kex Hostel reminded me so much of the Ace Hotel , especially in terms of decor and ambience . It hardly felt like a backpackers enclave to me . What 's really cool is there are so many interesting things to look at : bookshelves containing old record players and globes , walls covered in old bingo cards , stacks of vintage suitcases and trunks , old clocks and bird cages and magnetic poetry . <p> In short , Kex is the most un hostel-like hostel Ive ever stayed at . It is so much more than a place to crash for the night its an experience in and of itself . I 'd highly recommend this Reykjavik hostel ! <h> Thank you to to Kex Hostel for hosting and feeding us on our @ @ may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Great review , now I want to stay there .

@@118792775 @7792775/ <h> Packing For Asia : Howd I Do ? <p> With just a few weeks left on my backpacking trip , I think I can accurately assess how well I did packing for Asia . <p> I kept this 3-bag setup throughout the entire 5 months and it worked quite well but I wo n't lie , it was quite cumbersome , especially at times where my backpack weighed more . Not only was a couple kg of extra weight noticeable on my shoulders , but it also made packing a top-loading backpack extremely tedious because I was constantly unpacking and repacking my bag . I had to repack everything JUST SO or else it would n't all fit . I highly recommend a front-loading pack for backpacking trips I 'll be investing in one for next time ! <p> Overall , I think I did a pretty excellent job in packing for Asia . Several items I packed proved to be worth their weight in silver AND gold . There were also a few things I packed that I never used , and a few things I SHOULD have packed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest area for improvement would be the weight of my pack . Hovering just under 20kg the entire trip , I know I can do better next time around . For me , 20kg was very uncomfortable to carry on my back , and 15kg was much more manageable . <h> The Weight Of My Pack <p> My main backpack got weighed before every flight I took , so I was able to keep tabs on how much weight I 'd been carrying.Note : This excludes all electronics ( which I kept in my day pack/carry-on ) <h> Start of the trip : 18kg <p> I had clothes for all weather , from the snowy Himalayas to conservative India to hot &amp; humid Southeast Asia . <h> 2 months into trip : 20kg <p> I bought some things along the way , which added weight to my pack . Oops . <h> 2.5 months into trip : 15kg <p> I shipped home as much as I could , namely the winter clothing , trekking gear , and souvenirs I 'd bought for people back home . <h> 3.5 months into trip : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . t was inevitable ! <h> End of trip : 18kg <p> When I finished my 5 months in Asia , I got rid of a lot of the cruddy , worn-in backpacking clothes that I knew I 'd never wear again but I also bought a few new items to wear in London , which kept my pack weight consistent . <h> Most Useful Items Packed : <h> Lululemon shorts <p> I 've never owned a lululemon product and I 'm not keen on yoga attire , but these lululemon reversible shorts are clutch on the road in hot climates . They are just the right length and do n't ride up , which I appreciate as someone who prefers to have her thighs mostly covered . They 're obviously great to wear for any active endeavor ( biking , hiking , etc ) but also work well with a tank top or t-shirt . And best of all they kept all my sweat under control while in Southeast Asia . <h> Extra passport photos <p> These are crucial to have if you want to obtain a visa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in another country . I knew in advance that I 'd be traveling through multiple countries in Southeast Asia , so I had a stack of passport photos with me , on call whenever I needed them . It saved me the hassle of having to get my picture taken and printed out somewhere abroad . <h> Havaianas flip flops <p> I wore Havaianas every.single.day. in Southeast Asia , did a ridiculous amount of walking on the reg , and my feet never hurt . They are cheap , durable , comfortable , and go with just about anything you 'd wear there . And this is coming from someone with big , flat feet that have gotten beaten up by 98% of shoes they 've ever worn . <h> Quick-dry clothing <p> When you are backpacking for an extended amount of time , you are not going to be doing laundry regularly , nor are you going to pack enough clothes to last weeks without washing . I took to hand washing the items I 'd wear most often , in-between laundry drop-offs . Having quick-dry underwear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang them up to dry , and they 'd be ready to wear/pack in the morning . The quick-dry items I bought for this trip : <h> Sarong <p> Ok , technically I did n't pack this item , but I went to Thailand with the intention of buying one straight away . Note : Every sarong sold in Thailand has either a ) . elephants , or b ) . tropical fish on it so if those do n't appeal to you , buy a sarong elsewhere ! It saw an insane amount of use on this trip : <p> as a beach towel <p> as a skirt or cover-up on the beach <p> as a top sheet for sleeping at night <p> as extra padding around my camera gear <h> Padlock <p> Having my own padlock came in handy whenever dorms did not provide locks for their lockers , or tea houses/bungalows did n't have locks on their doors . I 'd venture to say I used my own lock at least 50% of the time at my accommodation . Definitely bring a lock with you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels ! <h> Items Packed But Rarely Used : <h> Pacsafe <p> I 'd heard enough horror stories about theft in hostels and on overnight buses and trains in Asia that I wanted to do everything in my power to secure my luggage while traveling . I bought the Pacsafe 85L with this in mind , but never used it because nearly everywhere I stayed had secure lockers , and when I traveled overnight by train or bus I just kept my valuables on me at all times and had my backpack pockets padlocked . Also , when I was playing around with the Pacsafe , I had a lot of difficulties getting it to lock this product is not easy to use . I will be selling this item when I return home . <h> Makeup <p> I have a daily makeup ritual back home and could n't imagine breaking free from it while on the road , so I packed my whole kit . I did n't touch it at all the first few weeks of my trip , since I was trekking and then I got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you 're constantly on the go and never see the same people on a daily basis , wearing makeup seems kind of pointless . My makeup bag stayed at the bottom of my backpack the entire trip . <h> Items I Should Have Packed : <h> Backup camera <p> By far the biggest mistake I made was not packing a backup camera . I 'd never had a camera break on me , so I did n't think I 'd have to worry about it . And I was trying very hard to limit the weight of my bags , where an extra couple of pounds would have been very noticeable . In retrospect , I should have packed either an extra SLR camera body or a smaller camera as backup . LESSON LEARNED . <h> Floss picks <p> I use floss picks daily back home ( I have a hard time using regular floss because of the braces bar behind my teeth ) and did n't think to pack them . I never saw them in Asia . My dentist wo n't be thrilled with my lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think I underestimated just how much beach time I 'd have , and overestimated the abundance of hammocks at the places I stayed at . Some guesthouses and beaches did have hammocks , but most of the time they did n't , or they were n't located in an ideal spot . I 'd have loved to have had my own hammock to string up wherever I went . <h> What are your tips for packing for Asia ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Girl you crazy .

They run some awesome bike tours around Sydney , which would have been perfect if we were brand new to the city but since we 've been living in Sydney for awhile , we were eager to get off the tourist track . <p> We walked into their office in The Rocks with a vague idea that maybe we 'd ride over the Harbour Bridge into North Sydney , but open to their expert suggestions for where to cycle in Sydney . <p> We walked out with an entirely different plan , armed with restaurant and bar recommendations and brand spankin ' new bikes to take on the ferry over to Manly . Here 's how our Sydney cycling adventure unfolded <h> Manly Beach <p> First order of business ? Sampling Sydney 's supposed best fish and chips at Manly Ocean Foods , per the recommendation of Matt of Bonza Bike Tours . This nondescript outpost on The Corso is easy to gloss over , but they stand out because they actually use fresh fish in all of their menu items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ordered the classic fish and chips and took it over to the beach , where we were harassed by a swarm of seagulls as we devoured our lunch . <p> Being British , Anna 's a bit more of a snob than I am when it comes to this fast food staple . She deemed them " good " ; I personally found the fish to be fantastic , possibly the best I 've ever had ( which is n't saying a whole lot , since I 've only ever had fish and chips a handful of times in my life ) . <h> Freshwater Beach <p> The guys at Bonza sang the praises of Freshwater Beach , urging us to ride up to Freshie and check out this local spot . It 's just the next beach up from Manly , but a bit of a mission to get to on foot we were very happy to be able to ride there with our bikes ! <p> When we first stepped onto Freshie I was n't super impressed with it ; but as we walked along the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were slammed with some fetching views of Manly in the distance , and what turned out to be a beautiful Freshwater Beach just in front of us . Anna swam , while I layed out on the rocks at low tide and sunned myself . Man , this view ! <h> Curl Curl Beach <p> Acting on hypothesis , we moved on from Freshwater Beach and walked north along the coast at low tide to reach the next beach . I was n't entirely sure how far Curl Curl was from Freshie , nor if it was even possible to reach it without heading up to the main road but that just added to our adventure , I think ! <p> We did a bit of rock scrambling ( and lunge-ing , in my case ) on this rugged stretch of coast . I wandered out onto this rock ledge completely unaware of how thin it was until Anna started shrieking at me to get the hell off of it . I guess it was sturdier than it looked ! <p> Really though , how gorgeous is the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we were stepping foot on some other planet with all the oddly textured rock then we 'd look up at the crashing waves and golden beach in the distance and be reminded that NOPE , we really were in stunning Sydney . <p> Then we came upon what I 'm deeming the highlight of our North Sydney cycling adventure : the ocean pool at Curl Curl Beach . Like most of Sydney 's ocean pools , it 's a big lap pool but this one also had a small , shallow pool on the edge , facing out over the ocean . We could n't help but break into photoshoot mode I mean , come on , does this scene not scream Facebook cover picture ? ! Let the gratuitous bikini shots continue ! <h> North Head <p> We walked back to Freshie from Curl Curl to get our bikes , then cycled back to Manly to pick up some picnic supplies to take up to North Head for a little sunset dinner . And oh my gosh , the bike ride to North Head was SO HILLY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steepness , but our snazzy new Bonza bikes dominated them like champs . <p> But wait , what exactly is North Head anyway , and is it worth the strenuous trek uphill from Manly ? ( You 're totally wondering that right now , are n't you ? ) <p> Well , North Head is part of Sydney Harbour National Park , aka the most glorious thing about this city . You can walk there from Manly Beach , which I highly recommend if you have the time ( at least 3 hours for the roundtrip walk ) . Otherwise , it 's a quick ( albeit exhausting ) bike ride up the paved road from the Manly ferry terminal . You 'll know you 've reached it when you see this stop-you-in-your-tracks panoramic clifftop view over Sydney Harbour : <p> We joined the other picnickers on the grass there and fashioned some veggie wraps to nom on while waiting for the sunset . The only thing we were missing was a bottle of wine to share but do n't worry , we made up for it afterwards by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let the generic name fool ya this place is FANTASTIC . I could n't get over the delightful decor , and how every single seating area was different yet equally enticing . And yeah , the wine was pretty ok too : ) Cheers to the guys at Bonza Bike Tours for yet another solid recommendation ! <h> Thank you to Bonza Bike Tours for lending us bikes to incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

Of sunset bike rides , picnics in the park , island getaways , sunburnt naps on the beach , tanktops and flip flops . <p> Thanks to Winter Storm Janus , I 'm powering through the cold , snowy weather with thoughts of Colombia and Hawaii : imagining what my upcoming inaugural trip to South America in 2014 will entail , reminiscing over a 10 day roadtrip around the Big Island in 2012 . <p> Oh gosh , Hawaii . Bright blue waters , sand of all colors , ridiculous landscapes , and 80-degree weather . I would 100% rather be back there than trudging through snow and slush right now , but the closest I 'm gon na get to that is looking through old photos , a la my Hawaii instagram . <h> Big Island <h> Mauna Kea <p> We flew into Hilo and made our way around the Big Island in a counterclockwise direction , our first major stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , Mars-like landscape in the clouds ; the invisible cows were an added bonus ! <p> All the blisters and shoulder scarring was worth it for what awaited us in the valley : an untouched oasis where we pitched our tent , hung our hammocks , and harvested our own coconuts . We also got hopelessly lost trying to reach a waterfall in the nearby jungle . Waimanu was undoubtedly one of my greatest adventures ever . <h> Kona Coast <p> You cant go wrong with the Kona coast , what with it being a dry 80 degrees every day and hosting the kind of beaches that dreams are made of . All I wanted on my 27th birthday was to eat pancakes and plop myself on a beach : the whiter the sand and the bluer the water , the better . MISSION ACCOMPLISHED , and then some ! No trip to Kona is complete without a stop at a coffee farm , particularly if you 're a coffee snob ( who , me ? NEVER ) . <h> South Coast <p> Too much white sand ? No problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south coast . Personally I 'll hang my hammock on any of the above , but it DID look especially snazzy over the black sand . <p> In between beaches , we drove down a ridiculously windy road to the southernmost point of the USA and let the record state that both Lauren and I , uh , left our mark here ifyaknowwhatimean . Technically she left hers ever-so-slightly further south than I did , but I say its close enough to be a draw . <h> Hawaii Volcanoes National Park <p> To be honest , I was a little underwhelmed by Volcanoes National Park until at night , when we were drawn from our campground toward a glow just across the street . It turned out to be LAVA glowing ! The volcano was n't erupting , but it was still crazy-bright and crazy-cool to see . <h> Hilo / East Coast <p> The east coast of the Big Island is understandably overshadowed by the rest of the island , but it holds its own with all its waterfalls and natural hot springs . My favorite part was navigating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road , and aimlessly walking into the bush in search of natural saunas . More often than not wed approach a large rock and find it to be well , just a rock . But we always held out hope that wed see a bit of steam seeping through , and then we 'd crawl through the opening to find a wooden bench or ladder inside that the locals had brought in to use while enjoying the sauna . <h> Honolulu &amp; Waikiki Beach <p> When we originally booked this Hawaii trip , we thought ending it with a few days in Honolulu at the Hilton on Waikiki Beach would be a nice treat a reward to lasting 10 straight days camping and trekking and being frugal backpackers . <p> But honestly ?

@@118792796 @7792796/ <h> Insta-Colombia : Colombia By Instagram <p> Shortly into the new year , my friend Nicki and I decided to book a cheap flight to somewhere warm and exotic . At a near-laughable $365 roundtrip during mid-February , Cartagena won out . <p> And so we found ourselves heading to Colombia 6 weeks later , without the faintest idea of what to do there . With a little research , a rough plan fell into place : Cartagena to Santa Marta , a few days in Tayrona National Park , and then back to Cartagena , all within 8 days . There were other beaches and towns we could have ventured to , but were both fans of slow travel and would rather see a few places thoroughly than rush through several different places and only scratch the surface . <p> Our route <p> Being professional photographers , we felt it was our duty to thoroughly document this adventure on instagram ( check out our #fotocolo14 hashtag for a compilation of images from both of us ! ) . I 've got hundreds of other photos taken with my real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but here 's a quick look at our 8 days ( which turned into 9 misadventure post to follow ! ) , via my Colombia instagram photos . <p> Sunrise in Bogota before switching flights . <h> Cartagena <p> We bookended our trip with some time in Cartagena , crown jewel of the Colombian coastline . I caught a fantastic view of the modern skyline from the plane as we flew in , which is where all the fancy hotels and resorts are located . Unfortunately Cartagenas beaches are nothing to write home about , so there 's not much point in staying on the waterfront . <p> Instead , we spent the bulk of our time exploring the Old Town . Colonial Cartagena is vibrant and rife with history and culture , carefully preserved . By 9am its near unbearably hot to be spending too much time walking around , but that did n't  stop us from going photo crazy ( and sweating like crazy ! ) . Cartagena has balconies and flowers for DAYS . <p> Admittedly , we drank a LOT of red wine and fruit smoothies while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cafe where we sat perched on the balcony drinking and making fun of the old people tour groups passing through the square below , vowing never to travel like that when we grow old . Another favorite was La Cevicheria , a beach themed restaurant with fantastic seafood their catch of the day with pesto and coconut rice was BOMB . <p> Aside from straight up frolicking around Old Town Cartagena , one other must-do is walking on the city wall that surrounds it . In my mind , the best part of it is the birds eye view you have down the streets leading into town . The worst ? The guys trolling the wall trying to sell you trinkets . <h> Santa Marta &amp; Minca <p> Santa Marta is the jumping-off point for Tayrona National Park , so our passing through town was inevitable . We stayed at Colombias sole ex-cartel hostel , Drop Bear , and spent an afternoon in Minca , a nearby Sierra Nevada mountain town where coffee is grown . We 'd originally wanted to try an adventure activity like canyoning or rappelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Instead , we took an impromptu " tour " through the woods , hiking to a couple of waterfalls . I 'd by lying if I said I enjoyed the hike it was in no way flip flop friendly . Even worse , my lower legs and feet got eaten alive by bugs ( they 're still itchy and swollen , one week later ) . But then we ate at a western restaurant and I got to have vegetables and good coffee , so all was well again . <p> Santa Marta is n't all that exciting a town , but we felt obligated to check out the waterfront . The brilliant sunset we caught made up for the underwhelming beach . If you 're planning a trip to the Colombian coastline , I 'd say Santa Marta is skippable unless you want to take a daytrip from there to a nearby beach , or do an adventure activity . <h> Tayrona National Park <p> I 've made a point to see a fair number of beaches on my travels , so when I say that Tayronas got some of the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Need I say more ? <p> Getting to Tayrona requires a couple bus rides , followed by a few hours of hiking through jungle and beach . We stayed at the campground at Cabo San Juan . Yes , its crowded and there are other spots you can camp in peace but trust me , this is where you want to be . Cabo is the most gorgeous beach in Tayrona ! Rent a hammock or a tent and budget as many days as possible here . <p> It was 3 glorious days of reading at the beach , catching sunsets , eating The Best Arepas ( Almost ) Ever from this random little stand , and getting horribly sunburnt but sufficiently tan . I was especially excited when I finally found fresh coconuts for sale , which we watched a boy fetch from a nearby tree that he scaled . Now that 's local living ! <h> Which photo from my Colombia instagram is your favorite ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792797 @7792797/ <h> Oh How I 'd Love To Love Melbourne <p> I was supposed to have made it to Melbourne months ago . Even though I may not have officially declared my intentions in writing , I had it in my mind that I 'd spend the bulk of my year on the work and holiday visa in Australia living in Melbourne . After all , I 've already lived in Sydney it 'd do me well to try a new city this time around , right ? ( That 's what the overbearing sensible part of me concluded , anyhow ) <p> So after my mid-December arrival , I traveled around Queensland and Tasmania , allotted a couple weeks for Sydney , and figured I 'd be in Melbourne by late January . But that was before Sydney seduced me into staying an additional two months . What can I say I 'm a slave to the beach and I 'm not sorry about it ! <p> At Bronte Beach in Sydney <p> Also , a little praise for the beauty of NOT PLANNING and GOING WITH THE FLOW is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ' or had a job lined up in advance , I would n't have had those two magical months in Sydney . I would n't have met the fantastic people I was privileged to spend my days with there . On a higher level , it just feels really good to act on feeling and impulse . I did n't feel ready to leave Sydney , even though it might have been more sensible for me to leave and find a proper job so I stayed until it felt right to move on . <p> I 'm realizing that planning is what happens when we let our minds get in the way of being present . Planning is a way of attempting to control our lives , but so much good stuff happens when we let go of those plans and surrender to everything outside of us . I 've spent most of my life being a planner , and while it often comes in handy , it 's at the sacrifice of spontaneity ( and fun ) .

I totally get what people mean when they say you can experience all 4 seasons in a day here . A couple days ago you could find me sunbathing at St. Kilda Beach . Today , I 'm clad in a proper jacket and pants ( yes , pants the horror ! ) on a blustery , soggy autumn day . <p> And oh god , the hipsters ! It 's like they took the hipster population of Williamsburg and multiplied it to the 50th power , then spread it across half of the neighborhoods in this city . Most of the guys that pop up on my Tinder are some degree of bearded and/or tattooed and I 'm not thrilled about it ( facial hair creeps me out ; tattoos will never make sense to me ) . <p> But above all , MELBOURNE HAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' list would be utterly pointless because every other cafe here brews coffee that would kick the arse of most coffee shops in any other city . I 'm so overwhelmed by options and the notion that I will never sample even a sizable fraction of Melbourne 's stellar coffee offerings , but of course that wo n't stop me from trying ! <p> Atomica Caffe in Fitzroy <p> Hosier Lane in Melbourne <p> Aside from the temperamental weather , Melbourne and I are getting along exceptionally well . If it were n't for my flight booked from Perth to Townsville for my upcoming Hinchinbrook Island press trip in early May , I 'd be quite happy to linger in Melbourne indefinitely ( again , see what I mean about planning being the worst ? ) . Instead , there 's an uncertain expiration date looming over me as I try to get to know this fantastic city .

In theory , this should be plenty of time to see a new city but I 'm finding it difficult to get in my groove here . I 've bounced between a work gig , crashing on a friend 's couch in an outer Melbourne suburb , and roadtripping around Victoria . I feel like I 'm somewhere in-between a tourist and a local here , aimlessly walking around like somewhat of a zombie in that gray area . I keep stumbling upon artsy , bustling streets while frolicking around Fitzroy and Brunswick and ca n't help but feel like I 'm on the outside looking in . Stylish thrift stores , trendy sidewalk cafes , hip bars brimming with hip locals this city is full of cool , but without any money to spend or a collection of friends here in the know , it 's hard to enjoy any of it . Every time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , let me find a real job , get my own apartment , buy a used bike , and make Melbourne my Brooklyn 2.0 . <p> A vintage store in Brunswick <p> If I 've learned anything , it 's that Melbourne is a city best enjoyed as a local , not a visitor . All the really good stuff here lies well beyond the tourist radar . It 's a city that you need to commit to in order to truly experience and love . <p> ( Pretty sure that 's a metaphor for my whole life , but that 's a discussion for another day ! ) 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> That 's so true .

@@118792798 @7792798/ <h> A Day Trip To Koh Nang Yuan <p> When you book an international flight semi-last minute and primarily because you found a good deal , - you 're probably not going to do extensive- research to prepare for this trip . <p> In my case , I booked a cheap flight from Sydney to Phuket about 2 weeks in advance because it was the most inexpensive , non-NZ- international flight I could find within my desired date range . And it was Thailand , a country Ive already spent a cumulative 7 weeks in its a place I know reasonably well and absolutely adore . Pah , what research ? <p> BUT , I will admit to briefly Googling things to do in Koh Tao that do n't  involve partying or diving . And that 's when I stumbled across an image depicting this exact stunning view : <p> This is Koh Nang Yuan , a small island off the west coast of Koh Tao owned by the guy responsible for the ubiquitous Chang beer . All you really need to know is that its absolutely beautiful and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island while you 're in Koh Tao . <p> But my job here is to inform and inspire , so allow me to elaborate on this Nang Yuan goodness ! <h> Getting to Koh Nang Yuan <p> You have two main options when it comes to getting to this little island : <p> Hop on- one of the- snorkel boat trips that circumnavigate Koh Tao . They will all stop at Koh Nang Yuan for an hour or two where you can snorkel or enjoy the beach . I saw signs plastered all over the island advertising the Popeye tour for 500 THB- ( US$14 ) - normally 750 THB- - which is an absolute- steal for a trip around the island . HOWEVER : you will have limited time at each stop , will be stuck traveling with a large group of people , and will be on Nang Yuan at- its most crowded . <p> Hire a longtail boat. - Right outside the infamous Lotus Bar on Sairee Beach you can hire a longtail boat to take you to the island for 300 THB ( US$8.50 ) return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the trip out there if you are traveling solo . Your driver will ask you what time you 'd like to be picked up and taken back to Koh Tao , and will tell you which number boat to look out for at the pier when you 're ready to return . If you know you want to spend more than just an hour or two on the island , this is definitely your best option . Go early if you can : the snorkel boat crowds infiltrate the island from 9:30am-12pm , and from 12:30pm onwards . <p> The pier at Koh Nang Yuan . <h> Koh Nang Yuan Viewpoint <p> When you disembark at the pier , you must pay the compulsory 100 THB entry fee and discard of any plastic bottles you have on you ( yep , it sucked having to throw out the 1.5L of water- I had ! ) . <p> From the pier , you 'll glimpse a hill over to your left : this is where you have to hike up to reach the viewpoint . My strategy was to do this first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach for the remainder of the day . <p> There 's a boardwalk that winds around the lagoon and deposits you at the foot of a very long set of steps leading uphill . Its a quick and easy walk , but you will be drenched in sweat by the end of it ( because Thailand is humid AF ) . <p> The Koh Nang Yuan viewpoint is at those boulders on the top of the hill here ! <h> Koh Nang Yuan Beach <p> Nang Yuan Island has- one seriously beautiful strip of white sand beach- at which 3 lagoons are parked . The water here is devastatingly blue and comes in an array of shades . <p> It may look like fine white sand that you just want to stick your toes in , but let me tell you that walking on the beach or in the water is not the least bit comfortable . Its actually comprised of coral bits , and out in the water there are larger chunks of reef you 'll need to tiptoe- around . I have very sensitive feet , so for me- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a chorus of " OW ! Crap ! Arghhhh ! " . <p> The lagoons at Koh Nang Yuan are much better suited for snorkeling , in my opinion . You can hire gear at the island dive shop . <p> Alternatively , there 's a really fantastic dive site just offshore here called Japanese Gardens where you can get your scuba on . Its a shallow site suited well for beginners and- Open Water divers . Dives , too , can be arranged at the dive shop . <p> But you know what ? I think you could be content just lounging on the beach at Nang Yuan . Strangely you are n't  allowed to lay out your beach towels , which essentially forces you to shell out 150 THB ( US$4 ) to rent a lounge chair and umbrella for the day . My first instinct was to hate on this rule , but later I was glad- to have a patch of shade to retreat to when the sun felt too strong . <p> I stayed on the island from 9:15am-2pm and felt like a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koh Nang Yuan . A full day of sun and heat would have been just a little too much for me . Like I mentioned above , go as early as you can because come 9:30am , the island will be full of snorkel tour folks and the sea littered with life jacket-clad snorkelers . There was a lull between tour boats from 12-12:30 , so I used that time to snap a few people-less photos of the water . <h> Have you ever been to Koh Tao or Koh Nang Yuan ? Does this look like your kind of beach ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Funnily enough I just wrote about Ko Tao and Ko Nang Yuan myself although it has been 7 months ( shit I am behind ) since I was there . I loved Ko Nang Yuan but did n't  love Ko Tao mostly because I did n't  see anything other than shabby Sairee beach because I was sick the whole time <p> Yeah girl , you got ta get off of Sairee !

@@118792799 @7792799/ <h> El Questro Gorge Hopping in the Kimberley <p> It 's been two months now since I began working at El Questro Wilderness Park in the Kimberley . Other than the fact that it was in the Australian Outback and likely rife with myriad outdoor adventures , I knew almost nothing about this place before accepting the job offer . It was one of those instances where you just feel in your gut that it 's right , and so you instinctively take that leap into the unknown without thinking without researching , planning , deliberating . <p> If I had to sum up El Questro in a word , it would be GORGES . You come to El Questro Wilderness Park to see the gorges : to hike to them , cruise through them , swim in them , marvel at them . <p> I still maintain that you need n't do much research before deciding to visit this amazing land , but in case you take to Google : here 's what the gorges at El Questro look like . <h> Chamberlain Gorge <p> This gorge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking trails around it . Chambo is El Questro 's most popular tour because it 's affordable , accessible , and only requires a couple hours of your day . Not to mention , of course , the beautiful scenery it promises . Depending on the day , there might be a breakfast cruise and/or a mid-afternoon cruise offered . Both feed you champagne , but the early morning tour also includes bacon and egg rolls with your bottomless mimosa . ( Can you guess which tour I opted to take ? ) <p> The Chamberlain Gorge cruise is a slow boat ride that feels a bit more commercial than the smaller Explosion Gorge cruise ( see below ) , but it 's still well worth doing particularly if your time and money are limited . You might even pass by a freshwater crocodile in the gorge like we did ! ( unfortunately I was too far away to get a decent photo ) <h> Explosion Gorge <p> Explosion Gorge is the other gorge at El Questro that requires a boat trip because it ca n't really be hiked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the gorge cruise followed by sunset drinks and snacks at the spectacular Branco 's Lookout nearby . <p> When I first arrived , I asked all my fellow staff for suggestions on what to do first , and almost unanimously they implored me to hop on the Explosion Gorge tour . Between the significantly smaller group size and the more enclosed gorge walls , it felt much more intimate than the Chamberlain Gorge cruise ( see above ) . I still remember how it felt to look straight up the gorge , noting the trees growing out of the rock walls and the discolored marks left from when water flowed down them during past wet seasons ; to sit in the dinghy in silence observing an exotic native bird launch itself across the gorge . Explosion Gorge is such a special place if you 're going to splash out for one paid activity at El Questro , this should be it . <p> The cruise wraps up by late afternoon , in time to catch the sunset from Branco 's Lookout . This season there 's been a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't spot him when we were there . But man , the view of the river junction below is just unreal , sunset or not . <h> Moonshine Gorge <p> The Moonshine Gorge circuit is the easiest gorge hike at El Questro . There 's minimal incline and hardly any rock scrambling . The only remotely challenging bits are the creek crossings , but even those are pretty easy to tackle , especially later in the season when water levels are low . <p> It may not present much of a physical challenge , but Moonshine makes for a nice little jaunt over the saddle and along the creek amidst the livistona palms . At a steady pace , you could complete the loop in about an hour but allow more time to enjoy the great swimming holes along the way . <h> Amalia Gorge <p> They say Amalia Gorge is best done just after the wet season , while the waterfall is still flowing at the main gorge pool . However , I can vouch for its awesomeness smack in the middle of the dry season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on mostly level ground . After you reach the first pool , things get a little trickier if you decide to carry on to the main gorge pool . There are a couple points where you need to hug a rock wall in order to get along the trail , which always makes me nervous when I 'm carrying my camera bag . But just take your time and it 's totally doable without incident . <p> I think the best part of the whole Amalia Gorge hike is the view you have once you climb up from the first pool and look down on it . In my mind , it 's the picture-perfect Australian frame with just the right proportions of blue , green , and orange . <p> The walk to Amalia Gorge takes about an hour each way ; longer if you stop to swim . In my experience , the water here is the coldest of any gorge pools at El Questro and it 's also got some funky-looking green stuff on the surface in some parts . Maybe not too appealing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to my photos . <h> Emma Gorge <p> Behold , the most renowned of El Questro 's gorges and one of the most famous gorges in all of the Kimberley . The trail to Emma Gorge is probably the least scenic of any of the gorge hikes , but it hardly matters because it 's so short and leads to , well , this : <p> No matter how cold the pool is , you 'll want to swim across to the waterfall at the other end , if only to be able to lay on your back and look straight up at the gorge walls . I had one of those rare *holy f$&amp;% am I really here right now ? * moments doing just this . You can admire it standing on the edge of the pool , but you really feel the magic of Emma Gorge when you 're in the middle of it . <p> Pro tip : be sure to swim behind the boulders on the immediate right side of the pool . Because HOT SPRINGS . One time I hiked to Emma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about the lovely bath-like water behind these rocks . <p> The walk to Emma is quick and rocky : it 'll take about a half hour if you 're fit and do n't stop along the way , but much longer if you want to take the rocks slowly . Aim to arrive at the gorge as early as you can because come 9am , families and tour groups will invade . <h> El Questro Gorge <p> The hike to El Questro Gorge is the most difficult of all the recommended walks at El Questro . Those who are n't up for such a challenge can opt to hike only to the Halfway Pool ( 1.5-2 hours return ) this part 's a cinch , and does n't require an exceptional level of fitness . <p> But I promise you , the second half of this hike is well worth the effort . You 'll start off by crossing the Halfway Pool in waist-deep water , then shimmying your way up the boulder to get back onto the trail . Sounds daunting , right ? But you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics in a dry bag , and hold your backpack above the water as you cross the pool . It helps if you have someone to pass your bag to once you get to the boulder , that way you can climb up with free hands . Or , you can just toss your bag up onto it and then climb . <p> The second half of the El Questro Gorge trail follows the creek through the gorge . Some parts of it are straight rock scrambling , with no footpath to be found . Just follow the trail markers and you 'll find your way okay . <p> But really , though : this part of the trail is SO ROCKY . You will be climbing boulders and hopping across rocks for most of the way . Shoes with good traction and ankle support are a must . If you 're a seasoned hiker and/or rock climber , it 'll feel like a playground . <p> All this effort will be worth it once you reach Mac Micking Pool at the end . It 's small , clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chance you 'll have it all to yourself . Highly recommend swimming out to the waterfall and jumping into the pool from the rocks below it . <h> Note that I toured these gorges free of charge as a staff member at El Questro Wilderness Park .

@@118792800 @7792800/ <p> One really cool thing to note is that this was the first trip I took with a pretty sizable Instagram following . I 'd been working on building my audience in the months preceding my move to Australia , and I had nearly 4000 people following my Queensland instagram feed . While its gratifying to get nearly 200 likes per photo now , the best part is seeing all the interaction that takes place in the photo comments . People mentioning their friends and urging them to check out my feed , folks asking me about photos , words of praise its all good stuff . <p> I consider myself a photographer first , travel blogger second . I 'd been a professional wedding photographer for years before jumping into the travel blogging world 2 years ago . Which is to say photography is kind of my thing . So if you 're going to follow me at all , Instagram is where its at . <h> Airlie Beach <p> I spent the first week of my trip in and out of Airlie Beach , the hub for all Whitsundays travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with tourist outlets , hostels , and small shops . There 's a man-made lagoon just between this street and the beach , where backpackers hang out during the day before partying all night . Those are about the only two things to do in this town . <h> South Molle Island <p> I had a glorious time on this small island in the Whitsundays , where I pitched a tent , hung up a hammock , and camped for two nights all by myself . Naked . The views from higher up on the island were to die for , which I enjoyed during a sweltering afternoon trek . <h> Great Barrier Reef Scenic Flight <p> I ticked one major item off my bucket list when I took a scenic flight over the Great Barrier Reef with GSL Aviation . It went by so fast , and it looked exactly like every aerial photo you 've seen of the reef but still it was SO worth doing . I still ca n't believe I saw the famous Heart Reef ! <h> Whitsundays Sailing Trip <p> I was a little worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sporadically hit with motion sickness basically my entire life . But aside from feeling dizzy on one night , I was completely fine ! And those nights I slept on Solway Lass were the best nights of sleep I 've had in the 6 weeks I 've been in Australia thusfar . <p> Sailing the Whitsundays was one of the best travel experiences of my life ! Is there anything better than the wind in your hair , sun on your skin , and a good book in your hands ? When I was n't engrossed in my reading or dozing off , I 'd watch the islands pass by from the ship . And when we werent sailing , we were anchored at various islands snorkeling or exploring . And man , that Whitehaven Beach is something else . I can see why it was voted one of the Top 5 best beaches in the world last year ! <h> Townsville <p> After the Whitsundays , I headed up the coast to tropical Townsville for Christmas . I did n't  get to spend much time here before shuffling off to Magnetic Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Strand , the towns waterfront walking path . <h> Magnetic Island <p> I spent my first Christmas abroad on Maggie , a fairly accessible island in northern Queensland . It was really weird trading in hats and gloves for a bikini on this holiday , but being on a gorgeous beach made me slightly less sad to be missing out on my usual Christmas traditions back home . <p> Now : can we talk about how the photo below scored over 2000 likes on instagram ? ! Sometimes I get really excited about posting a photo because I know its awesome , and perhaps even one of my favorites . This was NOT one of those times , and I definitely did n't  expect it to do so well . So why did it , then ? Do people really dig zig zags ? <p> My 4 days on Magnetic Island were largely spent exploring all the beaches on the island . Literally all of them . Apparently I do n't  know what a true beach vacation is because I cant sit still ! <p> Oh and how about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are just the cutest things !

Aside from having to manually change my age on the sidebar of this website and my social media platforms , I do n't  feel any older . I 'm pretty ok with that ! <p> I do n't  usually make a big deal of my birthday , but I had a birthday/going away party last year and it was so fun that I thought I 'd do it again this year . I did n't  plan anything else , yet somehow my whole weekend ended up being filled with all the things that make me happiest : coffee , chocolate , drinks , frolicking , singing , city views , bridges , street art , cats , and Latin food . I guess I unintentionally used my birthday as an excuse to binge on all my favorite things ! <p> Heres what I got up to during my birthday weekend ! <h> Friday <p> Friday night after work , I headed to Cobble Hill to kick off my birthday weekend . Its not exactly a neighborhood I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth checking out <h> Cocktails at Clover Club <p> Some claim it to be the best mixology bar in Brooklyn , but I think I 'll have to go back to Clover Club and verify that for myself ! They have an extensive cocktail menu that I did n't  even look at because I was so overwhelmed by their Happy Hour list . Even after sampling just the one cocktail , it was clear to me that this place takes their drink making very seriously . I 'd love to return to this classy bar sometime ! <h> Dessert at The Chocolate Room <p> In my mind , most sweets are n't  worth it unless they 're chocolate . Sipping on the richest dark chocolate imaginable and nibbling on a piece of flourless chocolate cake at The Chocolate Room was about the closest to heaven a restaurant has ever taken me . I pretty much want to go back and try all their other chocolate offerings . In fact , if I could just redo this Friday night sometime and consume nothing but artisanal cocktails and dark chocolate , I 'd be ridiculously content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Manhattan for a modest birthday celebration with some of my favorite people . This was the only part of my birthday weekend in NYC that I actually planned ! <h> Drinks at 230 Fifth <p> In my 6 years of living in NYC , I 've somehow managed to avoid Manhattan tourist hotspot , 230 Fifth . I 'm not too into the bar or club scene regardless , but you know what I AM a fan of ? Rooftops , in particular ones that yield fetching city views . Nestled between 26th and 27th street , 230 Fifth provides a birds eye view of the Empire State Building from its rooftop patio . During winter , they have heat lamps on the perimeter , big red robes for you to wear , and spiked cider and hot chocolate at the bar . Even better : you can avoid the crowds by going before 10pm and/or during the winter . It felt more like a casual yet festive gathering of friends than a night out at a lounge , which is EXACTLY my style . <h> Karaoke at Duet 35 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a birthday gathering was so I 'd have an excuse to karaoke . I take my karaoke very seriously , so a casual song or two at a noisy bar just wo n't do . Its not unheard of for me to grab a friend or two and coax them into renting out a private room and having a 3-hour marathon karaoke session but its also not every day . With thousands of song options , cozy private rooms , and room service for food and drink , Duet is my favorite karaoke spot in the city . <p> I finally debuted my long-time shower jam " Speechless " by Lady Gaga and of course nobody even knew the song , but I killed it ( *ahem* #humblebrag ) . I also got roped into dueting to some old school Britney Spears , " I 'm Not A Girl , Not Yet A Woman " ( was this ever even considered one of her hits ? ) , which quickly turned into an unexpected and slightly embarrassing solo . But SO MUCH FUN ! <h> Sunday <p> My actual birthday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the unfortunate honor of sharing my day with Superbowl Sunday as was the case this year . Like every other Superbowl Sunday , I spent the day avoiding the spectacle a slightly more challenging task since NYC was hosting the 2014 Superbowl . I stuck to my Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg and kept the football madness to a minimum . <h> Coffee at Blue Bottle <p> I do n't  visit Blue Bottle as often as I should , but as a coffee snob I must say that their New Orleans iced coffee is THE BEST . Its slightly sweet with hints of chickory , capped off with a generous dollop of milk . Adding sugar would be blasphemous . I took my happy hit of caffeine and went on my frolicking way . <h> Frolicking around Williamsburg <p> It was 50 degrees on my birthday I do n't  know if that 's ever happened to me ! I had to take advantage of the unseasonably balmy weather by being outside as much as possible . ( Spoiler alert , we got a snowstorm late that night the warmth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy Williamsburg waterfront , then all over the neighborhood ogling new street art . We all know I 'm a sucker for grit and street art ! I made another frivolous coffee purchase , snacked on a buttery garlic bagel from The Bagel Store , and wound up meeting my roommate Lauren for dinner at our favorite restaurant ! <h> Dinner at Caracas <p> I fight the perpetual internal battle of sticking to my favorites vs. trying something new . Yknow , the whole comfort vs adventure balance . When it comes to eating out in the neighborhood , Lauren and I usually have the intention of trying a new spot ( lord knows Williamsburgs got plenty of fantastic restaurants ) but at least 90% of the time , we call on our long-time favorite : Caracas Arepa Bar. - And you know what ? IM NOT SORRY . Especially not on my birthday ! Why WOULDNT I want to have my favorite meal in the history of meals on what 's supposed to be my special day ? <p> here 's how I do Caracas : <p> Dark &amp; Stormy ( $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opted not to drink this time , as I 'd had enough the night before <p> Guacamole &amp; plantain chips split between us <p> La Sure+a ( arepa with chicken , chorizo , avocado , and veggies ) <p> Usually a 2nd arepa , but this time we each tried one of their specials : an omelet-like side dish , made of corn and filled with " homemade " cheese . Like 3/4 of it was cheese yikes ! <p> An instant hit of happiness right there . Until we have to waddle our way home afterwards . <h> A Professional Cat Bath <p> This will likely out me as a crazy cat lady , but instead of watching the Superbowl , I watched my cat get a professional bath in my kitchen sink . After weeks of her curling up in oily frying pans , shed become quite the dirty little hamster well beyond saving with my feeble attempts at body soap baths . You might be thinking , Lindsay why did you let your cat lay in a dirty skillet every day ? And to that I would reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross for me to let this kind of behavior to continue . I thought about bringing her to a nearby pet groomer , but google revealed the existence of Kitty Pride Inc a local business that makes house calls to groom cats in Williamsburg and Greenpoint . Thankfully they were free with a days notice and were happy to stop by our apartment on Sunday night to clean up our cats . The whole process was wildly entertaining I had to stifle my impulse to guffaw nonstop as I watched my kitty being soaped up , then relieving herself in the middle of it because she was scared , then looking a lot like ET as they dried her off . After a thorough degreasing , drying , and brushing , Chibbers looked noticeably fluffier and softer . Who knew kitty grooming was a thing ? ! I 'm so happy we did this both for the entertainment and the well being of our cats . <h> How would you spend a birthday weekend in NYC ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

Behind me , a street lined with- converted campervans and hip kombis . Around me , other sun worshippers and the odd joint smoker ( or five ) . <p> My last evening in Byron Bay was so stereotypically Byron , - which is normally due cause for an eyeroll from me .

Byron Bay is- exactly what you 've heard its like . <p> Byron Bay is an incredibly peaceful place .

@@118792804 @7792804/ <h> Theres No Sugarcoating It : I Hated Phnom Penh ! <p> I 'd like to think I give each place I visit a fair chance to show me what theyve got . We should n't be so quick to judge when we meet new people , so its only logical that we do the same when we visit new cities/countries . <p> Well , I gave the capital of Cambodia a shot . My feelings about Phnom Penh can be summed up like so : <p> Sometimes you just ca n't help how you feel . I disliked Phnom Penh instantaneously , just as I did Adelaide and Delhi . I tried to prove my gut wrong , but in the end Phnom Penh did not win me over . I was very eager to leave after just 1.5 days . <p> What did n't  I like about Phnom Penh , you wonder ? In short : most everything . More specifically : <h> Phnom Penh is not pretty <p> Usually you can find a few aesthetically pleasing things in an otherwise drab city , be it a pretty waterfront or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penh in a futile search for beauty . The buildings are n't  that nice , the streets are n't  made for frolicking , and the waterfront was disappointing to say the least : There is no view from the river , unless you count the inevitable view of young boys bathing in the midday sun . I felt no sense of culture walking down this boulevard , as all of the restaurants and bars catered toward tourists ( and were mostly empty when I was there ) . No , Phnom Penh is not a pretty city . <h> Phnom Penh is not easy to get around <p> One of the most important things to me when I 'm in a city is the walkability : Can I walk everywhere and anywhere ? If not , is there an affordable transportation option ? <p> Phnom Penh is fairly flat , and the streets are numbered in such a way that you end up covering way more ground than you thought you would ( i.e. they are n't  numbered 1,2,3 the numbers skip at irregular intervals , so it seems ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  many sidewalks . And in typical Asian fashion , street carts and motorbikes spill out onto the streets , forcing you to walk in the middle of the street to get around them . <p> There is no mass public transportation in Phnom Penh , so if you 're not walking or biking , you 're reliant on tuk tuks to get around town . This gives tuk tuk drivers the power to overcharge . I paid $3 to get from the bus station to my hostel , which would have been a 10-15 minute walk had I gone on foot . Talk about a serious ripoff ! <p> One other thing that kept me from getting around town seamlessly was all of the drivers and vendors constantly calling out to me to sell this or that , or take a ride with them . I 've found this aggressiveness varies throughout Asia in some cities you 'll rarely be bothered , while in others you are hassled beyond reason . Phnom Penh falls on the latter end of the scale . If you so much as look within a 90-degree radius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its awful . I did n't  even make it to the Russian Market because I was so annoyed with other vendors I encountered along the way there . <h> Phnom Penh is depressing <p> here 's the kicker : Phnom Penh has not fully recovered from its fall in 1975 . Before I visited , I was n't aware that this happened less than 40 years ago . The city may be functioning today , but its people still suffer the damages and losses of the war . If you look at it that way , its not surprising that their city is n't beautiful and has no public transport anymore . <p> I felt obligated to learn about the Cambodian genocide while in Phnom Penh , so I paid a visit to the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum . Its actually a school-turned-prison that the Khmer Rouge used to torture and ultimately kill over 17,000 Cambodians from 1975-1979 . At the museum , you can walk through the old prison cells and see some of the instruments of torture used . The walls of the victims headshots are particularly moving . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing in this world who contributed to such a massacre just a few decades ago . <p> Note : For a double dose of depression , you could also check out the Killing Fields , where most prisoners were sent to be murdered . <h> Have you been to Phnom Penh ?

These colorful braided mountains were a scrumptious feast for the eyes on Day 1 as we were trekking out of Landmannalaugar .

Highly recommend Svartifoss as a must-do on an Iceland roadtrip ! <h> 3 . Reynisfjara Beach <p> This glorious black sand beach in Iceland is revered more for its towering basalt columns ( similar to those found at Svartifoss ) ; however , I was slightly more enamored with the beach itself . We visited at just the right time , with the late day golden light hitting the rocks oh-so-perfectly . Enjoying some wine and chocolate at Reynisfjara was one of my favorite moments in Iceland ! <h> 4 . Godafoss <p> There 's something really cool about Godafoss in particular when compared to the hundreds of other waterfalls in Iceland .

If roasting in the equatorial sun gets old , you can grab an arepa or a fresh coconut for an afternoon snack in the shade . <p> Or if you need a change of scenery , just hop on over to a nearby beach : there are several both north and south of Cabo . Allow me to illustrate ! <h> Cabo San Juan <p> There are a few campgrounds in Tayrona National Park . Cabo San Juan is the most popular , and for good reason : its centrally located , and home to the most beautiful beaches in Tayrona . Though I usually prefer to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , in this case its worth following the crowd and basing yourself at Cabo . Its all about location , location , location . <p> And beauty . OBVIOUSLY . <p> And sunsets . Cabo has a fantastic viewpoint right in the middle of its two beaches where you can watch the sun set over the mountains . I quickly fell into a routine of spending late afternoon perched on the rocks with a book and the suns last rays falling on me , then hanging out for the sunset on the other side . <h> North of Cabo San Juan <p> There are walking paths that connect Cabo with other beaches on either side . If you venture north , you 'll find two long beaches with hardly any people ( I 'd say 10-15 people at most were there when we were ) . I reckon they are unofficially topless/nude beaches , based on the percentage of beachgoers we saw without a swimsuit on .

@@118792807 @7792807/ <h> Insta-Spain : Spain by Instagram <p> I was a little late to jump on the Instagram bandwagon though it certainly was n't by choice , resistance , or ignorance . Verizon did n't  start carrying the iPhone until February 2011 , so really they 're to blame for my late start . Rest assured , I joined Instagram the day I finally got my hands on an iPhone and promptly snapped a photo of my cat ( I mean , is anyone surprised by this ? ) . <p> The next month , I 'd get plenty of Instagramming practice in as I frolicked around Spain for 2 weeks , documenting life on the fly in Madrid , Valencia , Seville , Cordoba , and Barcelona . And on that note , please forgive me for any unfavorable filters I may have used ( *ahem* Kelvin ) . <h> Photos From My Spain Instagram <h> Madrid <p> Madrid was the first stop on my whirlwind tour of Spain , and I do n't  think I did it justice . It deserved more than the 2 days I gave it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I still managed some decent frolicking . I popped into El Prado on the day of free admission , wandered around parks and plazas , and took a ride on the metro ( which I was seriously impressed by ) . <h> Valencia <p> My entire Spain trip was planned around a stint in Valencia for Las Fallas essentially a 5-day party in honor of St. Joseph , where each neighborhood constructs a massive character out of **26;207;TOOLONG and sets it in some sort of satirical scene . During the first 4 days of the festival , locals put the finishing touches on their scenes while parades and other events take place around town . Then , on the last night , all of the statues are set on fire and everyone parties all night long on the streets . Las Fallas definitely merits a blog post of its own , but for now suffice it to say that it is one of the best festivals you can take part in . <p> Oh , and as if that werent enough excitement , I managed to sneak out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a total contrast from the old town of Valencia , yet I loved them both immensely . <h> Seville <p> I was underwhelmed by Seville , but it may be partially due to the very high expectations I had for it . Seville is THE PLACE for Americans to study abroad apparently , and I kept either running into them , rooming with them in hostels , or being mistaken for them . <p> But Seville had its highlights for sure . Its cathedral is absolutely beautiful , albeit mobbed by tourists ( like me , *cough* ) . Wine was phenomenal . Weather was delightful ( I even got a slight tan , in March ! ) . And watching a flamenco performance at a local bar was one of those *Only in Spain* experiences I 'll cherish forever . <h> Cordoba <p> I took a day trip to Cordoba from Seville , primarily to check out La Mezquita , its gorgeous mosque . We also toured the Alc+zar de los Reyes Cristianos and ambled along its gardens and grounds . I loved my time in this city ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my Spain trip : Barcelona . Rarely do I visit a city and am able to see myself actually living there , but that 's exactly how I felt . I could live in Barcelona . With its Old Town , modern city , funky art ( hello Gaudi ) , and beach , this city has it all . <p> Oh , and pro tip : never wait til the last minute to cross an item off your bucket list . I stopped by La Sagrada Familia on my first day in Barcelona and it was so mobbed that I opted to come back another day and do it when the crowds had lessened . Unfortunately , " another day " turned out to be my last day , which was the one day of the week the church was closed to the public ( Monday ) .

On Easter morning , I found myself packing my bag with a harness and helmet and hopping into a van with Moab Cliffs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest terms , is navigating through canyons in essentially any way , including but not limited to hiking , climbing , jumping , swimming , and rappelling . Outside of the USA it 's referred to as canyoning , but regardless it 's something many people have never even heard of . If you think about it , this makes sense : most people do n't have easy access to canyons , so it 's not something they or anyone around them would likely be doing . But canyoneering is a thing ! And it 's reasonably popular in the western US , particularly in Utah . <p> We drove up into Sand Flats Recreation Area and began our hike to Ephedra 's Grotto not too far from the Slickrock Bike Trail . I was nursing a sprained toe and absolutely dreading this part of the excursion , but the stunning scenery motivated me to ignore the pain and carry on . I feel like they totally undersold this aspect of the canyoneering trip : they do n't tell you that half of the day is spent hiking through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoying the insanely gorgeous landscape .

Our guide , Heather , was so accommodating as she helped me cross over safely without making me feel super lame for being the only one who could n't jump . <p> We reached our first rappelling site and the 7 of us went down into the canyon , one by one , on the ropes . I 'm no stranger to being on a rope or traversing a rock wall , but lowering myself down was an entirely unfamiliar sensation . Heather methodically secured me to the ropes and gave me a quick lesson on how to rappel .

I froze upon seeing an Outback-like scene before me : bright orange rounded rock , bright blue sky , lush green vegetation scattered in the valley below . I was so happy to be there , so immersed in the scenery that I let everyone else take their turn before me . <p> The first rappel has more of a gradual start as you inch over the edge and down the wall , while this second one requires close to a 90-degree step over the edge . It was unnerving to say the least , but Heather talked me through it and once I got over the ledge I was completely fine . This one entails a short rappel down the rock wall , then a free hang the rest of the way down after the wall ends . Surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I lowered myself down as slowly as possible , so as to maximize the time I got to spend dangling and twirling around in the air as I passed by the bridge . <p> I took time to savor the changing view : the bridge as I passed by it , the trickling stream of water coming out of the rock on the other side of it , the Outback doppelganger-like valley that came into view as I dropped lower , the bridge as I looked up at it from below . It did n't matter that I did n't have a GoPro to capture the experience it 's something I 'll never forget . <p> I rode my natural 4/20 high out of Negro Bill Canyon , pretending like I was back in the Australian Outback and that my right foot was n't screaming bloody murder at me .

A night where the surreal seems real , White Night Melbourne is a rare opportunity to experience the city in a different light . <p> Beyond that , I knew there would be colorful light installations around Melbourne city center , and that was enough for me to venture out in the middle of the night on one random February day . <p> The NGV building on Flinders Street . <p> White Night kicks off at 7pm and concludes at 7am the following morning .

I figured families with children would be out and about early on , so I 'd let them have their time and then show up around 11pm . <p> Federation Square during White Night . <p> Turned out , White Night at 11pm was a madhouse . Streets were completely packed with pedestrians ( and thankfully closed to vehicular traffic ) . I grabbed some quick shots at Fed Square and quickly headed across Princes Bridge to the south side where it was marginally less chaotic . <p> White Night light installations at NGV on St. Kilda Road . <p> My favorite light installation of the night was the one projected onto the National Gallery of Victoria ( NGV ) on St. Kilda Road . It showed the progression of civilization in Australia , specifically around Melbourne , with images of aboriginals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is today . I sat there and watched the light show at least 5 times through and never tired of it . <p> There were a couple of displays in the Royal Botanic Gardens , including this neat little one that changed colors as you touched it . <p> I froze in my tracks the second I reached the riverfront and looked up at the Melbourne skyline . How amazing does it look with that hot air balloon and the colorful lights ? Why cant it look this good every night of the year ? ( I know , I know then it would n't be special ! ) <p> There was a fantastic projection over the water depicting a rainstorm building up and then clearing . The sound effects that went along with it made it even more captivating . I 'd have stayed and watched this one on loop as well , but the grass along the river was packed with people smoking pot so I did n't  linger too long . ( Anyone else feel like vomiting at the slightest smell of marijuana ? ) <p> Is it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ? <p> I crossed back to the north side of the Yarra and up to Birrarung Marr , a popular waterfront park for outdoor markets and other special events in Melbourne . I 'd been meaning to get some good night shots from this foot bridge for months , and with the addition of the hot air balloon it seemed like a pretty ideal time to make this happen . The balloon kept spinning around in the wind , making it a wee bit challenging to shoot ! <p> By now it was after 2am and I was feeling pretty pooped ( again , #grannystatus ) , so I headed back into the city toward where I 'd parked my bike . The walk back was not without entertainment : I passed by random projections onto side street buildings , street performers playing to packed streets of onlookers , and light shows projected onto both majestic buildings and people . <p> Light projections on the State Library of Victoria <p> White Night lights on the Royal Exhibition Building . <p> In sum : I loved White Night Melbourne . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art and culture in this city . <p> I was only there from 11am-3am and felt like there was so much more I could have seen .

If I were to do it again next year , I 'd arrive earlier right after sundown ( by 9pm latest ) , brave the crowds , and stay for as long as possible . <h> Have you been , or would you want to attend White Night Melbourne ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118792829 @7792829/ <h> A Perfect Day In Junbesi <p> We were n't even supposed to visit Junbesi ; our Everest Base Camp trekking schedule had us taking a quicker route up to Lukla so that we 'd completely bypass the village . But I remembered reading something online where lots of people kept recommending a rest day here and thought surely it must be worth a stop , then ? <p> It took some metaphorical arm twisting , but my guide agreed to take the detour to Junbesi . The trek there from Phaplu only took a couple of hours and guided us through a few small villages ( more like settlements , really ) . I was completely mesmerized by the colorful houses and the views across the valley . I observed the villagers going about their daily tasks manual tasks that the US has largely outsourced/automated that you just do n't see done there . People washing clothes by hand and hanging them out to dry in the sun , gathering/prepping crops from the garden , transporting goods between villages in baskets carried on their back . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chhopka 's Guesthouse . This ended up being my favorite tea house on the EBC trek . I had a gorgeous bedroom with a big bed and windows overlooking the village . The guesthouse had a deck that I spent the entire afternoon reading , writing , and sipping tea on . It was a glorious day with a breeze that made it a little too cool to wear a t-shirt , but sunny enough to keep you comfortably warm all day . <p> I stayed entertained by the owners ' little gray cats that sauntered around between the house and the deck , and their son who kept kicking around a soccer ball and chasing the cats . Those poor kitties were so skinny and malnourished . One of them had been burned recently and walked around now on 3 legs . I was sure to give it lots of love and attention : ) <p> I also made my first-ever attempt at washing my clothes by hand ! ( I know , I know shameful ! ) . It must have been a rather amusing sight with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes . He thoroughly scrubbed every inch of fabric on each item with a bar of soap before putting them through no less than 2 rounds of rinsing . I , in typical American fashion , dumped a portion of my cure-all Heavy Duty Liquid Wash soap into a water bin , let my clothes soak in it , then rinsed them out as if they 'd be magically clean without me doing a thing . A good amount of dirt washed out of my clothes AND they did n't seem to smell afterward , so I 'm marking this endeavor a success ! <p> I finally peeled myself off of the deck just in time for golden hour and grabbed my camera before walking around town . Junbesi is tiny , so it did n't take all that long to see the bulk of it . I kept getting distracted by little things , like the decorative borders around doorways and the colorful baskets carried by sherpas . I watched the sherpas slowly make their way uphill into town carrying supplies on their backs , which made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mountains . Much respect for them ! <p> I had a peek inside Junbesi 's monastery as with all the monasteries I saw in the Himalayas , it was like an explosion of colors . Every little bit of the walls and the altars was colored . Benches and blankets were set out in a circle around the main altar , and drums and flutes were set out for use during the daily ceremony ( unfortunately we missed it ! ) . <p> The evening was spent sitting in the kitchen in front of the fire , cat on lap , poring over maps and details for the upcoming trekking days . Just before bed , I remembered to look at the sky I have n't seen that many stars since camping in the Australian Outback ! Oh it was so beautiful and the perfect end to a perfect day ! <p> A Perfect Day , in my book , is a day of utter contentment where I literally think to myself , wow , today was perfect ' .

@@118792833 @7792833/ <h> Sydney Harbour Walk : Mosman to Cremorne <p> Regrettably too late into my year studying abroad in Sydney , I discovered Sydney Harbour beyond the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge . With over 30 beaches and seemingly infinite panoramic views , Sydney Harbour is a frolicker 's dream and a damn scenic place to swim . <p> The best part ? You 'll never enjoy the same view no matter where you are on Sydney Harbour . At any given spot you may see the Sydney Opera House and/or the Sydney Harbour Bridge , always at a different angle than at the last viewpoint you hit . You might stumble upon a bay filled with boats , a quiet park , a hidden cove-turned-secret beach , or a dramatic coastline . <p> I managed to devour a few walks along Sydney Harbour back in 2006 , but I vowed to come back someday and collect them all . So yeah , that 's what I 've been up to for a good portion of my time in Sydney so far in 2015 ( that is , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard which is n't often enough ! ) . <p> What I 'm trying to say is : If you travel to Sydney , you must do some Sydney Harbour walks ! I 'm going to be highlighting some of the best ones here on the blog , showing you exactly what they look like , where they are , how long they take to complete , and why you might consider one over the others . <p> First up : the Sydney Harbour walk from Mosman Bay to Cremorne Point ! <h> Walking from Mosman to Cremorne Point <p> You can start the walk from a few different ferry wharves , depending on how long you want it to be . For maximum frolicking , take the ferry to the Taronga Zoo , skip the zoo , and walk westward toward Little Sirius Cove . Alternatively , you can take the ferry to Mosman Bay and cut the walk nearly in half . <p> The views of Sydney as you disembark at the Taronga Zoo wharf are pretty much the best . Do not feel guilty about stopping every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lord knows I sure did n't ! ) . <h> Little Sirius Cove <p> You lose a bit of the view as you walk into Little Sirius Cove , but you gain access to one of the best secret beaches in Sydney . To be honest , I do n't find it as picturesque as some of the other harbour beaches in Sydney , but it 's well loved by Sydneysiders because dogs are allowed and it 's also a calm , quiet beach for kids to swim in . <h> Mosman Bay <p> Making your way out of Little Sirius Cove , you 'll head into Mosman Bay . It 's hard to tell which there 's more of here : boats or fancy homes . Either way , it 's fun to gawk at rich people 's playgrounds as you munch on your lunch of a granola bar and crackers ( *cough* ) . <p> When you get to the innermost point of Mosman Bay , you might opt for the 10-15 minute walk up into the center of Mosman to grab a snack or coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not looking to spend any money . But if you are , do stop at The Source Espresso Bar for coffee it 's spot on ! <p> Continuing around Mosman Bay toward Old Cremorne , the walkway passes by some really intimidatingly impressive houses , with equally impressive gardens . Then you look to the other side toward the bay with all the anchored yachts and you 're like , geez , where am I ? ! It feels like a whole other world frolicking around Mosman Bay . <h> Cremorne Reserve <p> Next the path leads into Cremorne Reserve , which is a park occupying that long skinny point that jets out into the harbour ( also known as Cremorne Point ) . The views here are similar to the ones by the Taronga Zoo , you 're except closer to the city ( i.e. maybe they 're a teensy-bit better ? ) . <p> Shortly after passing by the Cremorne ferry wharf , you 'll reach MacCallum Pool , which is awesome for two big reasons : 1 ) . It has one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's free . When I passed by it on a random spring weekday in 2006 , there was hardly anyone there ; however , when I stopped on a hot summer Sunday , the pool was poppin ' with families and 20-somethings . It was nearly 100 degrees and I was literally drenched with my own sweat , so I hardly cared about it being crowded this time around and hopped right in . <p> UGH , I just love this spot . It feels like you 're in a backyard pool , surrounded by bush as you look out onto the harbour at the Opera House and Sydney skyline . Magic ! <p> Just beyond MacCallum Pool is an awesome picnic spot with big rocks you can sit on that look down at the harbour ( Memo to any lovebirds or Tinder aficionados out there : this would make for a fantastic date spot ! ) . <p> I opted to lay out on the grass to dry off from my swim , but was abruptly interrupted when a ridiculous storm cloud descended over Sydney . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storm before ! Watching it devour Sydney and turn the city into a gray fog while kicking up 35+ mph winds was so humbling . Nature 's crazy , y'all. 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> How to get there : From Circular Quay , catch either the F6 ferry to South Mosman or Mosman Bay , or the F2 ferry to Taronga Zoo and walk westward along the waterfront to Cremorne Point ( see ferry map and ferry timetable ) . <p> How much time to allow : If walking nonstop , Taronga Cremorne Point takes about 1.5 hours , and South Mosman Cremorne Point takes about 45 minutes . Allow around 4 hours to fully enjoy the walk and its many viewpoints and swimming spots . <p> You 'll love this hike if you enjoy : Swimming with a view , fancy houses with gorgeous gardens , boats 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> This hike looks amazing , as does that pool . Honestly I 've never given much thought to traveling in Australia ( because I 'm an idiot ? ! ? ) but the more I read these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back is how expensive I 've heard traveling in Australia can be . 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> I will neither confirm nor deny the idiot claim , but I WILL say that yes , Aussie can be expensive however , the exchange rate is good for Americans here now , and as usual , there are plenty of ways to get by on the cheap . <p> Ive been doing HelpX for 6 weeks now , where I work a few hours a day in exchange for food and accom , and I 'm only spending about $400 of my own money each month on top of that ( mostly for day trips , wine , and coffee ) . If you work , wages are very generous its easy to find casual work especially if you 're flexible with location/job . <p> So basically you have no reason NOT to hit up Australia after Spain ! ; ) : D 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792834 @7792834/ <h> Highlights From A Melbourne River Cruise <p> In the past few years , I 've taken to exploring cities by boat . I 've passed beneath all of London 's Bridges on a city cruise down the Thames , sailed Boston Harbor on a sailboat , and gotten to know the heart of Chicago on a river boat . As far as I 'm concerned , there are few better ways to spend a day in a new city than on the water , soaking up the sunshine , camera in one hand and drink in another . <p> So that 's exactly what I did on a recent glorious spring day in Melbourne . Lizzie and I found a 50% off coupon in one of the local guides to Melbourne and booked ourselves onto a Melbourne River Cruise on the Yarra River from the city to Williamstown and back . <p> Our 2-hour boat trip kicked off in the city center and headed out toward Williamstown . Far and away the highlight of the tour for me was crossing beneath all the bridges ( you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got to do it again on the way back ! <p> Once our boat slipped out of CBD territory and out towards Port Philip Bay , it got noticeably cooler without the tall city buildings to block the wind . Make sure you bring layers to keep warm ! There 's also not a whole lot to see out this way other than some industrial lots , so if you find yourself unbearably chilly , you could always duck into the cabin for warmth without missing much scenery . <p> Williamstown is an old fishing town on the outer edge of the bay . From here , you can glimpse the Melbourne city skyline through Port Melbourne ( albeit from quite a distance ) . <p> You know you 're a photographer when you plan your sightseeing around the quality of light . I intentionally booked the latest tour ( departing mid-afternoon ) so that towards the end , we 'd be heading back into the city to see all the buildings bathed in that golden light . <h> Which is your favorite photo of Melbourne ? 205739 @qwx1065739 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to Williamstown costs AU$29 via Melbourne River Cruises .

I quickly swiveled my bar stool to face the window behind us and squinted to see outside from Kex Hostel . <p> " Huh mayyyyybe ? " I said , hopping down to get a closer look . We saw what looked to be a light green cloud in the sky just over Reykjavik Harbor , which vanished within seconds . Wait , did we both just imagine it ? <p> Not more than 30 seconds later , the green cloud reappeared in the sky just to the left of where we 'd seen it . Then it grew darker . " THIS IS IT !

@@118792838 @7792838/ <h> The Best Views of New York City <p> Not too long ago , I admitted to falling into a travel routine which finds me doing predictable Lindsay-esque things whenever I explore a city , whether new or my own : seeking out the good coffee , walking as much as possible , and being frugal with food and accommodation costs . But one of the more challenging activities I task myself with is finding the best vantage points from which to photograph the city . I typically look to the waterfront , to tall buildings , to bridges and boats to provide me with unique and photogenic vistas , but its not always obvious exactly where to go to capture a killer shot . <p> Being both a travel photographer and New Yorker for over 6 years now , Ive come to find many of the best views of New York City through trial , error , and plenty of exploring some in the most unexpected , untouristy places . If you 're visiting NYC or are a local photo enthusiast , be sure to check out some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above and afar ! <h> View of NYC from Hoboken , NJ <p> I do n't  necessarily advocate spending an extended amount of time in New Jersey , but for prime views of Midtown and the Financial District , its hard to beat the vantage points- from the other side of the Hudson . The best stretch of waterfront is in Hoboken , where you can either hang out in Sinatra Park or walk along the extended path that lines- the park and reaches the piers . Hoboken is also a great neighborhood for going out in with its younger crowd- and lively bars , so you could definitely make a day of it . <p> Essential Info : - To get to Hoboken , you can catch a PATH train from any of the stations along 6th Ave in Manhattan . <p> Alternate Views : Weehawken &amp; Jersey City , NJ <h> View of Manhattan from Top of the Rock <p> Top of the Rock plays second fiddle to the Empire State Building , but whenever someone tells me they 're planning on going to the top of ESB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . While you 'll have some of the best views of New York City from both , I think Top of the Rock is better because a ) . You have a view of the iconic Empire State Building from it , and b ) . The wait to get to the top is always shorter than it is at ESB . <p> If you can swing it , I highly recommend visiting Top of the Rock at varying times of day because the city looks so different depending on when you go . My usual strategy is to show up about an hour before sunset and shoot the buildings as they 're glowing from the golden hour light , then patiently wait for sunset and the transition from dusk to night . <h> View of NYC from the East River Ferry <p> One thing that makes me very happy is how connected Manhattan is becoming to the rest of NYC via boats . The most recent addition to its ferry fleet is the East River Ferry , which you can catch from Long Island City , Greenpoint , and Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn Bridge Park . In fact , most of these ferry stops yield some of the finest views of the city , as highlighted throughout this post . <p> The best thing about the ferry is that it takes you down the East River and under bridges , providing you with constantly-changing city views that you cant enjoy anywhere else . <p> Essential Info : A ride on the East River Ferry costs $4 on weekdays and $6 on weekends . <p> Alternate Views : Governors Island ferry ; NY Waterway ( from NJ ) <h> View from Gantry State Park <p> Gantry Park is quite possibly my favorite NYC hangout spot . The most astounding thing is that no one seems to know about it ! - Or if they do , maybe they do n't  want to schlep out to Long Island City . Either way , Gantry Park is underrated . My summer routine typically- has me laying out in a sunchair by late-morning at least once a weekend and there are always free seats , a rarity in a city where everything is perpetually overcrowded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its still worth a visit to take a walk out onto the piers and along the boardwalk . Whether from a sunchair or the nearby piers , you 'll get some of the best views of New York City from the lower Queens waterfront . <p> Alternate- View : East River State Park in Williamsburg , Brooklyn <h> View of NYC from Randalls Island <p> Not oft-visited , Randalls Island is a peaceful retreat from NYC proper , nestled square between Manhattan , the Bronx , and Queens . About the only visitors you 'll see are those that are there to play some kind of sport , as the island is home to more than half of the sports fields in all of Manhattan . Even if you 're not there to play , you can still cycle around the islands bike paths or take a walk along the road- on the south side facing Manhattan . Its a great place to chill out with a book and watch the boats pass by . <p> Essential Info : - To get to Randalls Island , take the RFK ( formerly known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx ; alternatively you can walk across the 103rd St footbridge from Manhattan . <p> Alternate- View : Roosevelt Island <h> View of Manhattan from Brooklyn Bridge Park <p> If you check out just one of the views I mention here , make it Brooklyn Bridge Park . This is the place where you 'll get the most dramatic , iconic shots of both the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges backed by the Manhattan skyline . What 's more , the park is newly-expanded and spans 1.3 miles worth of Brooklyn waterfront resulting in numerous different vantage points from which to photograph New York City . <p> And if taking pretty photos is n't enough , there are all sorts of activities you can take part in at the park . There are grills for BBQing , soccer fields and shuffleboard courts , volleyball nets , and more not to mention all of the summertime activities on offer such as Syfy Movies With A View under the Brooklyn Bridge , yoga classes , and kayaking by the Manhattan Bridge . Simply put , there is n't anywhere better to be if you 're visiting NYC during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being aesthetically intriguing itself , the Williamsburg Bridge yields glorious views of the nearby bridges and city skyline . On the Brooklyn side ramp , you get birds eye views of the gritty Williamsburg rooftops . Once you make it onto the bridge , you can see the Queensboro Bridge to the north and the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge to the south . Finally , upon reaching the Manhattan side , you can see straight into the Lower East Side and down traffic-laden Delancey Street . In my informed opinion , there 's no better bridge in NYC for photo ops than the Williamsburg Bridge . And , bonus : its both pedestrian-friendly AND bike-friendly , providing separate paths for each . <p> Alternate- view : Queensboro Bridge , RFK Bridge <h> View from South Street Seaport <p> While many visitors come to South Street Seaport to shop , drink , and take a historical tour of the area , photo enthusiasts should be sure to meander towards the waterfront and pass below the Brooklyn Bridge for fantastic wide angle views of it and the Manhattan Bridge . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamsburg Bridge in the distance further north . For the perfect shot of all 3 of these NYC bridges , head to Pier 17 ( near the big ships and former mall building ) and shoot north . <p> Alternate- view : The waterfront in DUMBO , Brooklyn <h> View of NYC from Governors Island ( and ferry ) <p> Two months after publishing this post , I ventured out to Governors Island for the first time in several years and immediately decided it had to be added to this list .

But one of the more challenging activities I task myself with is finding the best vantage points from which to photograph the city . I typically look to the waterfront , to tall buildings , to bridges and boats to provide me with unique and photogenic vistas , but its not always obvious exactly where to go to capture a killer shot . <p> Being both a travel photographer and New Yorker for over 6 years now , Ive come to find many of the best views of New York City through trial , error , and plenty of exploring some in the most unexpected , untouristy places . If you 're visiting NYC or are a local photo enthusiast , be sure to check out some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above and afar ! <h> View of NYC from Hoboken , NJ <p> I do n't  necessarily advocate spending an extended amount of time in New Jersey , but for prime views of Midtown and the Financial District , its hard to beat the vantage points- from the other side of the Hudson . The best stretch of waterfront is in Hoboken , where you can either hang out in Sinatra Park or walk along the extended path that lines- the park and reaches the piers . Hoboken is also a great neighborhood for going out in with its younger crowd- and lively bars , so you could definitely make a day of it . <p> Essential Info : - To get to Hoboken , you can catch a PATH train from any of the stations along 6th Ave in Manhattan . <p> Alternate Views : Weehawken &amp; Jersey City , NJ <h> View of Manhattan from Top of the Rock <p> Top of the Rock plays second fiddle to the Empire State Building , but whenever someone tells me they 're planning on going to the top of ESB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . While you 'll have some of the best views of New York City from both , I think Top of the Rock is better because a ) . You have a view of the iconic Empire State Building from it , and b ) . The wait to get to the top is always shorter than it is at ESB . <p> If you can swing it , I highly recommend visiting Top of the Rock at varying times of day because the city looks so different depending on when you go . My usual strategy is to show up about an hour before sunset and shoot the buildings as they 're glowing from the golden hour light , then patiently wait for sunset and the transition from dusk to night . <h> View of NYC from the East River Ferry <p> One thing that makes me very happy is how connected Manhattan is becoming to the rest of NYC via boats . The most recent addition to its ferry fleet is the East River Ferry , which you can catch from Long Island City , Greenpoint , and Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn Bridge Park . In fact , most of these ferry stops yield some of the finest views of the city , as highlighted throughout this post . <p> The best thing about the ferry is that it takes you down the East River and under bridges , providing you with constantly-changing city views that you cant enjoy anywhere else . <p> Essential Info : A ride on the East River Ferry costs $4 on weekdays and $6 on weekends . <p> Alternate Views : Governors Island ferry ; NY Waterway ( from NJ ) <h> View from Gantry State Park <p> Gantry Park is quite possibly my favorite NYC hangout spot . The most astounding thing is that no one seems to know about it ! - Or if they do , maybe they do n't  want to schlep out to Long Island City . Either way , Gantry Park is underrated . My summer routine typically- has me laying out in a sunchair by late-morning at least once a weekend and there are always free seats , a rarity in a city where everything is perpetually overcrowded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its still worth a visit to take a walk out onto the piers and along the boardwalk . Whether from a sunchair or the nearby piers , you 'll get some of the best views of New York City from the lower Queens waterfront . <p> Alternate- View : East River State Park in Williamsburg , Brooklyn <h> View of NYC from Randalls Island <p> Not oft-visited , Randalls Island is a peaceful retreat from NYC proper , nestled square between Manhattan , the Bronx , and Queens . About the only visitors you 'll see are those that are there to play some kind of sport , as the island is home to more than half of the sports fields in all of Manhattan . Even if you 're not there to play , you can still cycle around the islands bike paths or take a walk along the road- on the south side facing Manhattan . Its a great place to chill out with a book and watch the boats pass by . <p> Essential Info : - To get to Randalls Island , take the RFK ( formerly known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx ; alternatively you can walk across the 103rd St footbridge from Manhattan . <p> Alternate- View : Roosevelt Island <h> View of Manhattan from Brooklyn Bridge Park <p> If you check out just one of the views I mention here , make it Brooklyn Bridge Park . This is the place where you 'll get the most dramatic , iconic shots of both the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges backed by the Manhattan skyline . What 's more , the park is newly-expanded and spans 1.3 miles worth of Brooklyn waterfront resulting in numerous different vantage points from which to photograph New York City . <p> And if taking pretty photos is n't enough , there are all sorts of activities you can take part in at the park . There are grills for BBQing , soccer fields and shuffleboard courts , volleyball nets , and more not to mention all of the summertime activities on offer such as Syfy Movies With A View under the Brooklyn Bridge , yoga classes , and kayaking by the Manhattan Bridge . Simply put , there is n't anywhere better to be if you 're visiting NYC during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being aesthetically intriguing itself , the Williamsburg Bridge yields glorious views of the nearby bridges and city skyline . On the Brooklyn side ramp , you get birds eye views of the gritty Williamsburg rooftops . Once you make it onto the bridge , you can see the Queensboro Bridge to the north and the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge to the south . Finally , upon reaching the Manhattan side , you can see straight into the Lower East Side and down traffic-laden Delancey Street . In my informed opinion , there 's no better bridge in NYC for photo ops than the Williamsburg Bridge . And , bonus : its both pedestrian-friendly AND bike-friendly , providing separate paths for each . <p> Alternate- view : Queensboro Bridge , RFK Bridge <h> View from South Street Seaport <p> While many visitors come to South Street Seaport to shop , drink , and take a historical tour of the area , photo enthusiasts should be sure to meander towards the waterfront and pass below the Brooklyn Bridge for fantastic wide angle views of it and the Manhattan Bridge .

@@118792854 @7792854/ <h> Left My Soul Outback Australia <p> In April of 2006 , I took one of those trips that leaves you with mental images and memories permanently etched in your mind . I traversed the Australian Outback , from Adelaide northward to Darwin , in 10 days . Wide open space , big orange rocks , and star-filled skies that 's what I see when I recall my time in Outback Australia 8 years ago . <p> Look , I know its most renowned for its Great Barrier Reef but if you can only see one thing in Australia , let it be the Outback . There are plenty of other ( inferior ) reefs you can dive and snorkel in around the world , but there is only one Outback . And it is INCREDIBLE . <p> During my mid-semester break from Sydney Uni , I traveled to the Outback with two fellow international friends : Melvin ( from the Netherlands ) and Mike ( from California ) . Our trip divided neatly into 3 parts : 1 ) . Adelaide to Alice Springs , via the Ghan train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alice Springs to Darwin . I will sing the praises of independent travel to my dying day , but there are certain scenarios where it makes more sense to travel in a group . The remoteness and extreme conditions in the Outback , coupled with my lack of comfort in driving on the opposite side of the road , made traversing central Australia in a tour group the most sensible option . <h> Adelaide to Alice Springs <p> Our priority on this trip was to get to the Centre , so we whizzed through this region in under a day . I 'd have loved to have explored it and visited the mining town of Coober Pedy , but alas there will never be enough time to see everything . <h> The Ghan <p> The first leg of our Outback Australia journey covered nearly 1000 miles on a 19-hour train ride : The Ghan . We departed Adelaide in the evening and ended up in Alice Springs by early afternoon the next day . We had booked Day-Nighter seats on the train , i.e. the cheap seats , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's sleep . I spent little , if any , time in my seat , though . The three of us hung out in the lounge car and entertained ourselves with games and banter all evening ; then , when it came time to sleep , I brought my sleeping bag in there and sprawled out on one of the cushioned benches at the table . <p> I woke up early the next morning to an attendant tapping me on the shoulder a subtle request to get the hell up and remove my sleeping quarters from the common area before other passengers woke up and trickled in . I obliged , but remained sitting in the lounge car all morning , completely mesmerized by the scenery out the window . I 'll never forget waking up in middle-of-nowhere , Australia to my first sight of the Outback . A gorgeous sunrise soon revealed an expanse of orange sand , with the occasional bush or tumbleweed careening past the tracks . And so began my love affair with the Australian Outback . <h> Alice Springs <p> The 3 of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Outback tour began and had a day to explore Alice Springs . I 'd categorize it as a sleepy town : fine enough to use as a launch point for Outback excursions , but not necessarily a place I 'd seek out to visit on its own . <p> My biggest takeaway had to do with the people here . I was somewhat taken aback to see the aboriginal population perpetually hanging out on streets . I remember Mike and Melvin coming back to our room later that day in dismay after witnessing an aborigine peeing on a car in a nearby parking lot . I 've since seen far more astonishing acts while traveling ( ahem , India ) and even while living in New York City but it did seem quite out of place in Australia , at the time . I later learned about the poor conditions in the aboriginal camps outside of Alice Springs , subject to overcrowding , alcoholism , and violence ; what we saw in town was just the tip of the troubled iceberg . <h> The Red Centre <p> Behold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Centre . I just wanted to see that big orange rock in the desert ; anything else would be an added bonus . <p> We joined a 3.5 day camping trip with Wayward Bus , which took us on a tour through the area surrounding Alice Springs . It was gratifying to see Ayer 's Rock ( Uluru ) , and downright magical experiencing the Olgas ( Kata Tjuta ) but what stays with me to this day is the seemingly mundane motion of going to bed each night . Laying out my swag in the dirt , tucking myself in , staring up at the stars until I could n't keep my eyes open anymore . I 've never seen so many stars in my life as I did in the Australian Outback . <p> A thorny devil ; the starry Outback sky <h> Kings Canyon <p> Kings Canyon is unrightfully overshadowed , but if you 're already in the area visiting Uluru , you should definitely make a point to check it out . We did an enjoyable day hike around the rim of the canyon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main attraction to fully enjoy it . <h> Uluru <p> To be honest , seeing Uluru was slightly anticlimactic . We were sure to view both a sunrise and a sunset at Uluru from afar , then had some time up close to the rock when we could amble around its perimeter . You are technically allowed to climb it , but the aboriginals discourage it and request that visitors refrain from doing so . I respected that ; for me , it was enough just to be there in its presence . <h> Kata Tjuta <p> You do n't hear much about Uluru 's little sister , Kata Tjuta , but she 's a stunner . I had no idea how beautiful it was there , perhaps because no commercial photography is allowed on the grounds . We walked through the Valley of the Winds one morning and all I kept thinking was how heavenly this place was . I could just envision the indigenous folk way back in the day , frolicking around the hills , grabbing water at the streams and watering holes , living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this day , Kata Tjuta ranks as one of the most beautiful places I 've ever seen in my life . <h> Alice Springs to Darwin <p> The last leg of our Outback journey took on a different tone as we switched tours . Instead of continuing north to Darwin with Wayward Bus , they cancelled the trip and booked us on a similar 3-day tour with Adventure Tours . We went from having a small group dynamic to traveling as part of a large group of 3 tour buses ( 50-60 people total ) . Not exactly my style , but I reminded myself to keep perspective : I WAS IN THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK . Therefore , I forfeit my right to complain about anything . <p> Another note about the tour companies : Wayward Bus was more of a budget tour outlet , while Adventure Tours was a slight step up ( in both luxury and price ) . With Wayward Bus , we slept in swags and tents and helped cook and clean ; with Adventure Tours , we slept in bunkhouses and had our meals taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews to both companies , but I preferred the simplicity and back-to-basics of Wayward Bus . <p> An Outback pub <p> The area between Alice Springs and Darwin contains a hodge podge of sights , none of which are particularly remarkable on their own but collectively make for an enjoyable multi-day Outback jaunt . We made stops at the Devils Marbles ( a collection of big rocks scattered about ) and Katherine Gorge , where we opted to take a cruise down the river . <p> Devils Marbles <p> Katherine Gorge <p> After the tour ended , we had a free day in Darwin before flying back to Sydney . Since Adventure Tours did n't  stop at Litchfield National Park like Wayward Bus was originally scheduled to , 4 of us rented a car for the day and drove there ourselves . It was a fun day of swimming in waterfalls and gawking at massive termite mounds though I should never again be behind the wheel of a car that 's meant to drive on the left side of the road . <p> Litchfield National Park 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligent track of my travel expenses . Heres what I spent on my 10-day Outback trip : <p> 2 nights at a hostel in Alice Springs : $50 AU ( my portion of a triple room ) <p> 7-day tour with Wayward Bus : $686 AU <p> 1 night at a hostel in Darwin : $16 AU <p> 1 day car rental from Darwin : $41 AU ( my portion after being split between 4 people ) <p> Flight from Darwin to Sydney : $272 AU <p> Total Cost : $1100 US ( $1452 AU ) <p> <p> As of April 2014 Prices for most things have increased , while the exchange rate has worsened , since I traveled Outback Australia 8 years ago . <p> A Day-Nighter seat on The Ghan now costs $269 AU . <p> A 5-day tour from Darwin to Alice Springs with Adventure Tours costs $875 AU ( note : the one I did was about 7 days total ) . A 9-day tour with Adventure Tours costs $1175 AU . <p> One cost that has not significantly risen in the past 8 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin is about $100 AU per day , less than what we paid in 2006 . <p> Flights between Sydney and Adelaide can be found for less than $100 US ( much less than what I paid ) , and between Darwin and Sydney for $210 US ( about what I paid ) . My dates had been fairly inflexible , so I had to pay more than desired . <p> Total Approximate Cost : If one were to replicate my original journey through Outback Australia in 2014 , it would cost $1400-1500 US. 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Great post good to know about Kata Tjuta , we are hoping to go to Uluru next winter and will check it out .

Sure , there was a post about my camel safari in the Indian desert , which I took as an overnight trip from this town but other than that , nada . <p> Well , here 's what I did in Jaisalmer . I had come straight there from Delhi , where an agent at the tourist office made out with mein his office , then begged to accompany me later on in my trip i.e. I was basically on the run when I arrived in Jaisalmer . <p> Aside from sweating proverbial balls and dodging the usual Indian chaos whilst frolicking this lovely town both within the fort walls and outside of them I sought refuge in the cutest of cafes inside the wall for a little peace and shade . I ordered some juice and dug into my book while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a rotation of young Indian men who apparently worked at this cafe slash hotel : one by one they would come upstairs , ask if I needed anything , and then proceed to take a seat nearby and chat me up . When one guy left , another would take his place and follow the same formula . <p> I do n't  know why , but the ongoing presence of these Indian gentlemen did n't  bother me as much as it normally would . Eventually the owner ( let 's call him Fabio ) came to sit with me and regaled me with tales of growing up as a " desert boy " . His family was from the desert , where they had no concept of time he was n't even sure of his age ! I was fascinated , and in a moment of weakness I decided to take him up on his offer to check out the best lookout point in Jaisalmer . Fabio whisked me off to his friends hotel across town , where we hung out on the roof and watched the sun go down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering sweet nothings in my ear in such a romantical setting , and that later on he gave me a " desert massage " with mustard seed oil ( wait , should I follow this up with a Part 2 sometime ? ) . If you forget about those creepy things , this view of Jaisalmer WAS pretty magical . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> I NEED a part II to the desert massage . Do n't  leave me hanging like that . Your commentary on all your India posts is too funny , I love reading about the country from your point of view . 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> hahahahahaaaaa oy . I 'm just not sure how to write about it ! Such a bizarre experience . He had me sitting on his lap , straddling him at one point while he massaged my back . I refused to take my sports bra off , so it got caked in mustard seed oil and the smell lasted for weeks ! He also kept saying " give me your eyes " and would stare into them with such intensity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to manufacture an instant love story with me . IT DOES NT WORK LIKE THAT .

I just want easy access to beautifully scenic places where I can hike , bike , and frolic to my heart 's content , yannowhatimean ? <p> But I forgot about all that one afternoon this summer when I ventured out to the newly renovated Governors Island . A quick ferry ride from Manhattan or Brooklyn , this former military base turned urban playground makes for an excellent summer day trip from the city . <p> After 2 years of construction , this summer it debuted 30 new acres worth of parks , gardens , and play fields in an effort to " revitalize New York City 's waterfront " . And that 's just Phase 1 . Millions of dollars more are allocated to revamp the rest of the 172-acre island , 33 of which are reserved for future private development a la university housing , research centers , or hotels ( #gentrification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect time to visit . Here 's what you can do while exploring the new and improved Governors Island : <h> Grab a drink in the sand at Governors Beach Club <p> Upon disembarking the ferry from Manhattan , take a right off Soissons Landing and within minutes you 'll hit Governors Beach Club . Careful , though : it 's all too easy to wile away an entire afternoon sitting at a table in the sand , nursing coronas and burgers with club music blasting and one of the best views of NYC as your backdrop . If you 're feeling ambitious , you could get a game of ping pong or foosball going in the sand you know , in-between drinks . <h> Tour Castle Williams &amp; Fort Jay <p> The forts of Governors Island are old news , but they 're unique to the island and still worthy of exploration . It 's easy to do a self-tour of the forts , referencing the plentiful informational plaques scattered throughout for a little history lesson if you please . <p> Castle Williams <h> Hang out at Hammock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . Hammock Grove : 10 glorious acres housing 50 red hammocks on hills . Is there a better way to spend a sunny summer day than sprawling out on a hammock with a good book ( or in my case , the Lonely Planet guide to Iceland ) , looking up occasionally to spot the Freedom Tower in the distance ? I really hope the hammocks on Governors Island do n't disappear like the ones at Gantry Plaza State Park did after their first year of public use , but just in case it 's one more reason to get to this island stat ! <h> Sample the food trucks at Liggett Terrace <p> Given that food trucks are ubiquitous in Manhattan , it 's no surprise that Governors Island now hosts several food trucks and carts of its own . Shuffle along the old barracks building and sample tacos , empanadas , smoothies , ice cream , and more , then retreat to a set of chairs nestled amidst the hedges and enjoy your noms . This whole area has been made over with ample seating areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger for awhile . <h> Attend an event or tour the historic buildings along Colonel 's Row and Nolan Park <p> It may be tempting to spend the entirety of your Governors Island visit out of doors , but it 's worth ducking into a few of the historic buildings at Colonel 's Row and Nolan Park . It 's like a cultural grab bag : walking into any of the buildings , you never know if you 'll be treated to a tour of the space , perusing a pop-up gallery , or dropping in on some kind of class that 's being held . <p> What 's more , the surrounding lawns are where events are held on most summer weekends . You can either plan your visit around one of these happenings , or accidentally step into one . My first-ever visit years ago had coincided with Figment , the annual participatory art project on Governors Island . On my recent visit , I had unknowingly stumbled into the 1920 's at the annual Jazz Age Lawn Party . <h> Picnic on the Parade Ground <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind is a rolling green hill with the Manhattan skyline at the top , picnickers spread out on the grass and folks throwing around a frisbee . Post-renovation , this image is still accurate . The Parade Ground is a classic picnic spot . <h> Bike or play ball <p> Governors Island has always touted itself as being fit for biking , but with much of the island closed off in recent years , bike routes have been limited . But no more 2014 has seen the addition of several new bike paths within the 30 acres of green space that are now open to the public . You can bring your bike on the ferry free of charge , or rent a bike or surrey once you 're on the island ( $15 for 2 hours , or $25 for an all-day rental ) . There 's nothing like biking along the waterfront , Lady Liberty to your left and Castle Clinton to your right , then turning the corner as sweeping views of Manhattan take over . <p> Pro tip : If bringing your own bike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line before boarding the ferry to/from Manhattan ( space is limited on the Brooklyn ferry , so be sure to arrive early to grab a spot ) . <p> Or if organized sports are more your thing , you can take advantage of the new ballfields and open space on the Play Lawn , ideal for baseball and softball . <p> Can you spot the Statue of Liberty ? <h> What would you most like to do on a trip to Governors Island ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

But man , this beach is too good not to share with you ! <p> At Sai Nuan I found a place to hang my hammock and there I lay , Kindle in one hand , coconut snacks in the other , for several hours . When the heat got to be too much , I ran into the water to cool off ( relatively speaking , as the sea in Thailand is like bathwater ) . I 'd highly recommend following the same routine if you make it to this idyllic spot . <h> How To Get To Sai Nuan Beach <p> From Mae Haad ( where the ferry docks ) , walk south on the road parallel and closest to the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can either take the path left and uphill , or right and along the beach . Both run straight through the resort and will ultimately funnel you where you need to be , but I 'd say the beachfront path is more straightforward . <p> You 'll pass through another resort or two along the way , and there will be frequent signs pointing you towards Sai Nuan . If you have a decent sense of direction , there 's no way you 'll get lost . Its a 25-30 minute walk one way from the Mae Haad pier . <p> There is a small beach between Mae Haad and Sai Nuan called Janson Bay . Youll have to pay a small fee to access the beach if you 're not staying at the resort there ; alternatively , you can grab a drink or a bite to eat at the onsite restaurant with a partial view of the sea . <p> View of Janson Bay from the walking path . <h> Sai Nuan Beach <p> If you know anything about Koh Tao , youve probably heard of Sairee Beach : it has the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops . Not surprisingly , its where most visitors tend to stay so if you 're craving some solitude , you 're better off heading to a different Koh Tao beach . <p> Sai Nuan is the easiest beach to get to by walking . In fact , walking is pretty much the only way you can reach it aside from a water taxi . This is a beautiful , beautiful thing because it means this beach is rarely crowded . You see , most people on Koh Tao rent a motorbike and drive around the island to get where they need to go , so they 're far more likely to be at beaches they can drive to . <p> If you fancy staying in a secluded bungalow and do n't  mind carrying in- all your luggage on foot , then you need to stay at Sai Thong Resort right on Sai Nuan Beach . The only way to book in advance is to call the resort . I think if I ever return to Koh Tao , I 'll just show up and ask for a bungalow I cant imagine they book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , though ! ) . <p> There are two bungalows perched on the rocks just over the beach ( see photo below ) , and a bunch set back- from the sand scattered amidst the trees . There 's also a restaurant at the resort , and a tree swing right on the beach , neither of which I could be bothered getting out of my hammock for . You see , Sai Nuan Beach is absolutely perfect for lazing around in a peaceful tropical setting and doing little-to-nothing else . <h> Where in the world is your favorite secluded , lazing-around beach located ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118792865 @7792865/ <h> Walking Cape Woolamai on Beach-Studded Phillip Island <p> I very nearly skipped Phillip Island on the roster of Victorian excursions to take from Melbourne . All you ever hear about it is the famous Penguin Parade , and honestly I 'm not super interested in schlepping a couple hours just to watch these creatures waddle onto shore at dusk . <p> I started following some Melbourne instagrammers once I moved here , and soon after learned about a second thing you can see on Phillip Island : The Pinnacles , a gorgeous rock formation off of Cape Woolamai oft-photographed at sunset . Now is Phillip Island worth visiting ? , I asked myself . <p> I was still on the fence about it , but with a few days between when my housesit ended and my sublet began , and public transport to Phillip Island surprisingly not too inconvenient , I figured why not take myself on a little getaway . <p> And man , I am SO GLAD I went to Phillip Island . It knocked my socks off in the best way possible , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nook . I never even made it to see the penguins , but no matter Cape Woolamai was enough to make the trip worth it . Here 's a little glimpse of the beautiful Cape Woolamai . <h> Walking Cape Woolamai <p> I know I 've confessed before that the first thing I do upon settling into a new destination is research nearby coffee options . Well , hand-in-hand with my coffee research is looking for nearby walks or hikes I can do that yield some awesome views or cool finds . I just wan na see some pretty sights , y'all ! <p> It did n't take long for me to learn that Cape Woolamai 's got plenty of walking trails , so I was more than set in that domain . I was ready to make the lengthy walk from my accommodation in Newhaven down to Woolamai Surf Beach , the cape 's trail hub , which would have taken me at least an hour one-way then I discovered that during summer there 's a free Island Explorer bus that shuttles visitors around Phillip Island . A quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach on Cape Woolamai too easy ! <p> To reach the start of the Cape Woolamai Circuit , you have to start walking south down Woolamai Surf Beach , then take the first set of stairs up the dunes ( I believe there is , or was , a portion of the track that leads there straight from the parking lot , but as of January 2016 it was roped off ) . The views down toward the end of the peninsula are absolutely stunning , both from on the beach and above it . <p> You can opt to do just one portion of the circuit ( for example , the 4km return walk to the Pinnacles , or the 6km return walk to the Quarry ) , but I 'd recommend doing the entire 8km circuit . The walk to the Pinnacles and just a bit beyond has the most dramatic coastal views , but the view from the highest/southern-most point of the peninsula at the Beacon is well worth the uphill climb . <p> I followed the circuit in a counter-clockwise direction , heading toward the Pinnacles first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I glimpsed a different view of it and just COULD NOT PUT DOWN MY CAMERA . Youve been there , right ? Where you just get so darn worked up over the amazingness you 're witnessing and want to capture it all so that you can remember it perfectly ? Yup , that was Cape Woolamai for me . <p> I was so completely captivated by the constant views from above Woolamai Surf Beach that the Pinnacles were pretty underwhelming . I did n't  even want to take a picture of them ! ( Note : If you want to photograph this landmark , either head there in the morning or at sunset , else the rocks will be silhouetted ) . <p> Like I mentioned , if you 're just doing the Pinnacles walk , go a bit further because there are more spectacular cliff views to be enjoyed . Once the trail starts to head away from the cliffs and uphill , you can turn around . <p> Continuing on the circuit , the trail will lead uphill and away from the water . There 's not much to see until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : here you can look out over the entire cape , plus parts of the island and mainland . There 's a good chance you 'll run into kangaroos and rabbits as well around here . <p> The southern-most point you can reach on Cape Woolamai . <p> Heading back down , the trail stays inland and branches off about halfway down , at which point you can turn off and take a little detour toward the Quarry . Unless you 're super gung-ho about hiking and have plenty of time , you can skip this little side trek and keep following the trail back to the Woolamai Surf Beach parking lot . <p> View of the mainland . <p> A few final thoughts on walking Cape Woolamai : <p> The trail is smooth and easy going , and you 'd be fine walking in sneakers/trainers rather than hiking boots . <p> The trail is well-marked with signs that point out distances to landmarks so you always have your bearings . <p> Aim to walk around mid-to-late afternoon , where everything is bathed in warm golden light and the sun is less strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for tackling the Cape Woolamai walking tracks , it 's still well worth visiting for just the beach . It 's known for having consistently serious waves , so serious that they 've killed swimmers before . Not surprisingly , the beach at Cape Woolamai is extremely popular with surfers . <p> I 'd have contentedly spent an afternoon laying out on the beach here , gazing out at the nearby dunes and cliffs or watching the surfers , but because I 'd gotten a bit sunburnt I opted instead to come back to Woolamai Surf Beach on my last day in late afternoon . It was a tad too windy and cool to be sunbathing at this time , but pretty ideal for throwing on a light layer and reading a book . <p> One of the island bus drivers clued me in to a little shortcut to get from Cape Woolamai back to Newhaven ( or vice versa ) : instead of walking up Woolamai Beach Road to get to Phillip Island Road and then following that back to town , there 's a short trail across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach on the eastern side of Cape Woolamai , which you can walk on at any level tide to get to the Phillip Island Bridge , San Remo , and Newhaven in under an hour . If you do n't have a car or ca n't catch the bus , walking from A to B via Woolamai Safety Beach is the next best option . <h> What about you : is Phillip Island on your Australia or Melbourne to-do list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Mimi Rose <p> I missed out on Phillip Island when I was living in Melbourne and now I 'm kicking myself !

@@118792867 @7792867/ <h> A Guide To Hiking The Royal National Park Coastal Track <p> The Royal National Park Coastal Track is one of my favorite hikes of all time . Close to Sydney and accessible by public transport , it 's an easy weekend getaway for the frugal traveler . Better yet : the trail 's not crowded , and treats you to some stunning coastal vistas and near-empty beaches all along the way . You can trek the entire 27km in one ( very long ) day , but most hikers take it on over the course of two days and camp overnight on the track . <p> This hike is not very difficult : there are some uphill climbs to get around the headlands , but they 're short and not too painful . For the most part , the trail is lined with flat sandstone rock and you 'll be hiking out in the open sun . <p> Think you 're ready ? Here 's everything you need to know about hiking the Royal National Park coastal track <p> Source : Workout Australia <h> How To Prepare For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thankfully you wo n't need to carry too much for a 2 day hike , but here are the things I consider essential to pack for the Royal National Park coastal track : <p> Enough water to last through Day 1 ( you can refill at creeks along the way ) <h> Booking a campsite <p> Officially , the only legal place for camping on the Royal National Park coastal walk is at North Era campground . It 's a good stopping point on the first day anyway , plus it 's located right by North Era Beach which just may be the most beautiful beach in Royal National Park . You need to book a campsite online in advance : for AU$12 ( 3 people max per site ) , you can pitch a tent on a grassy knoll and have access to an outhouse . No campfires allowed , no drinking water provided . <p> If you do n't like the idea of prebooking a campsite , there are definitely a few spots along the trail where people have ( illegally ) camped before . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranger , but that 's up to you . Just make sure you leave no trace no matter where you camp ! <h> Getting To Royal National Park <p> From Sydney , take a T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line train to Cronulla ( 1 hour , AU$4.52 ) . From Cronulla station , it 's about a 5 minute walk to the ferry landing , where you 'll catch the hourly ferry to Bundeena ( 30 minutes , AU$6.40 ) . <h> Hiking the Royal National Park Coastal Track <h> Day 1 : Bundeena to Garie Beach <p> Day 1 of the Royal National Park coastal track is largely in open air , and you 'll be walking across exposed sandstone cliffs . Remember when I urged you to pack sunscreen and a hat ? Yeah , you 're going to want both of these things on the track , especially on the first day . <p> While at times you might feel like you 're melting right into the rock , I promise you it 's well worth it for the ridiculous coastal views you get to devour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge : <p> The dramatic coastal crags are pretty glorious , but my favorite views along the track are from the headlands looking out toward the beaches that you 'll soon traverse . Most of the accessible beaches on the Royal National Park coastal track are best suited for surfing , not so much for swimming but you can brave the freezing cold surf at your own risk ! Even if you do n't go in the water , it 's well worth taking a break from hiking to hang out on a beach or two as you pass through . You might even have it all to yourself ! <p> There 's plenty more to enjoy on the coastal track besides the ocean . The park is rife with birds and various plantlife , if that 's up your alley . You may even spot some whales just offshore if you happen to be hiking during winter . <p> No matter the time of year , quite early on in the trek you 'll pass by the famous Wedding Cake Rock : a stack of rectangular , bright white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly out of place here ? <p> Thanks to Brooks for snapping this one ! Clearly I was more interested in the sky than the Wedding Cake rocks . <p> The track crosses some small creeks and passes by a few waterfalls , none more impressive than this one ( below ) . You 'll know you 've found it when you spot water flying up into the air from the creek and falls . And if you 're as lucky as we were , you might witness a massive rainbow soaring over it . <p> One other point of interest on the first day of the hike is Wattamolla , about 9-10km from Bundeena . It may be teeming with daytrippers , but it 's a great spot for a picnic , BBQ , and swim . You can stop at the swimming hole in the creek that you 'll cross just before arriving at the picnic area , or you can swim in the lagoon below the dam that 's sheltered from the surf . Either way , it 's very safe swimming away from the ocean here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booked our campsite well in advance . We were about an hour away from North Era when we came upon a clearing just off the north end of Garie Beach , where people had clearly camped before ( as evidenced by the multiple fire pits there ) . We all had the same thought in mind : let 's pitch our tents here ! I 'm not saying I condone lighting an illegal campfire on an illegal campsite , but I 'd be lying if I said it did n't make for a fantastic ( and rebellious ) night ! <h> Day 2 : Garie Beach to Otford <p> Day 2 of the Royal National Park coastal track should be much shorter than Day 1 if you stay overnight at the North Era campground . But since we stopped just north of Garie Beach instead , it tacked on an extra hour or so of hiking to the second day . <p> How about this golden hour light just after sunrise at Garie Beach ? I loved zen-ing out here before kicking off a day on the track . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chance you 'll see some surfers . I noticed that there 's a brand-new facility and parking lot there to accommodate them . <p> Oh , and do n't forget to turn around once you get to the top of the grassy headland at the south end of the beach ! You 'll nab a pretty sweet view of Garie Beach looking north . I did n't get a good photo of it because we were facing the early morning sun which washed out the shot , but if you 're here late on Day 1 the lighting should be perfect with the sun behind you . <p> North Era Beach is a stunner as well . I can think of worse places to pitch your tent for the night , ca n't you ? <p> After this point , there are n't many more accessible beaches on the track . You 'll be hiking either up high or in the woods for most of Day 2 it 's a nice change of pace ( unless you 're a beach monger like I am ! ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 8 Pool . We made the mistake of not researching it beforehand , so we were n't sure how to access it and the signs on the track are n't very helpful . To reach it , you need to walk across Burning Palms Beach ( rather than walking past it like we did ) . At the south end of the beach , you should be able to access the Figure 8 Pool at low-to-medium tide . It 's pretty much exactly as it sounds : a figure 8-shaped tide pool formed in some rocks along the shore , fit for laying in . <p> Toward the end of the trail , we stopped and had lunch near the Otford lookout . While the lookout yields sweeping views of the coastline south toward Wollongong , our picnic spot was on an overhang that had a better view of the coast facing north . Near here , there 's a turnoff leading to Werrong Beach way down below . If you 've got the time and do n't mind a very steep uphill walk to get back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's more popular with daytrippers who drive to Otford , park their car by the trailhead , and make the short walk in . <h> Getting To Sydney From Royal National Park <p> Otford Station is a quick walk from the end of the Royal National Park coastal track you 'll see signs for the station once you reach the main road . From Otford , take the northbound South Coast Line train . You 'll likely have to switch trains at Waterfall station to get back on the T4 Eastern Suburbs Line toward Sydney ( 1-1.5 hours , AU$4.52 ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> hi , Lindsay ! ! I 'm planning a trip to Sydney with my family in July . We want to hike this track but there are several questions that confused us after doing some researches . if we take the public transport , are there any fees apply besides booking the campsite , like the entry fee for entering the Royal National Park ? The website said " make sure you get a bush camping permit from the park office in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Bundeena , how did you get your permit for your hike ? thank you in advance for your time , the Coast track is really stunning ! ! <p> Nah , all you have to do is book the campsite permit online in advance there 's no other park pass or fee to pay . And like I alluded to , there are places along the way where you can bush camp for free ( though technically you 're not supposed to ) . 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792868 @7792868/ <h> The Best Village Experience is in Luang Namtha , Laos <p> Crammed in the back of a local minivan in a sea of Lao people , I dozed in and out of sleep while we crawled from the Thai/Lao border to Luang Namtha . Every so often I 'd wake up , look out the window , and think to myself HOLY CRAP LAOS IS GORGEOUS ! We were traversing an endlessly winding road that would often turn a corner to reveal mountainous view after mountainous view . I could n't wait to get out there and be *in it* . <p> After about 4.5 bumpy hours , we arrived in Luang Namtha , where I 'd laid out 3 tasks for myself : village visits , cycling , and trekking . <h> Villages in Luang Namtha <p> Luang Namtha is primarily utilized as a stopover spot on the backpacker trail from China to Laos ; however , to me the main allure of Luang Namtha was how accessible the local villages are . There is one main road that runs through town with a number of dirt roads that skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked for a map when I rented my bike , which handily pointed out exactly where to find these spots . You can reach some villages on foot with a whole lot of walking , but its much more efficient to bike to them . <p> I was a little apprehensive about traipsing through villages where I clearly did not belong , but the locals were nothing but friendly and curious about me . I was careful not to intrude , but I had adults waving at me and children swarming me in no time . These girls kept posing for my camera without my even asking , and after each shot they would run to me to see what the picture looked like on the LCD screen . So adorable ! <h> Cycling around Luang Namtha <p> Cycling in Laos was a top priority for me . I wanted to ride through the countryside and past mountains and soak up the scenery on my own terms ( i.e. not while trapped inside a crowded minivan ) . <p> Laos is very hilly and the roads are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a mountain bike with gears . Attempting it with a cruiser or road bike is a suicide mission . <p> I took the main road north out of town and followed it indefinitely . It felt like I was going downhill an awful lot , which made me dread all the uphill action coming back . But I could n't stop ! Each hill and bend tempted me further . The thrill of speeding downhill and coasting back uphill gave me high after high until it started to downpour . Hello , Southeast Asian wet season ! <p> The scenery was totally worth getting soaked for . Hills , trees , villages , valleys , rivers just so much GREEN . I could n't get enough . And somehow , the ride back was nowhere near as arduous as I 'd suspected . The downhills gave me enough speed to get up most of the uphill parts at least part of the way ! <h> Kayaking Trip in Nam Ha NPA <p> Luang Namtha is the launching point for excursions into Nam Ha National Protected Area ( NPA ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of trips into the forest , from single to multi-day treks , kayaking trips , and village homestays or a combination of these . Its important to note that quality varies wildly between companies , so be sure to do appropriate research before you book ! I had wanted to do a multi-day combo trip so I could experience both trekking AND kayaking through the forest . <p> But here 's the thing : all throughout Laos , the price of your excursion or activity is dependent on the number of people that sign up for it . Being low season and traveling solo , this meant I was at the mercy of other groups . All of the tourist offices have chalk boards outside that list any outgoing trips , so once you see a trip you like you can join in and pay less for it . I scoured these boards for 2 days and not much was going out . I ended up recruiting a Dutch couple and we compromised on a kayaking daytrip through Forest Retreat Laos . <p> We took 2 double kayaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and me and our guide in the other . I 'd never gone in an inflatable kayak before , but it was pretty easy to maneuver ! ( I think that had more to do with the fact that I had a certified guide steering , but hey ! ) . We paddled through Nam Ha and were hit with constant blue and green backdrops . At some sections of the river we let the current carry us as far as it could , which allowed us to rest a bit before continuing the paddle . <p> We made a few stops along the way : first for lunch , where we sat by the river and had veggies and rice wrapped in bamboo leaf . Among its many other uses , bamboo serves as the Lao/Thai version of tupperware . Could they be anymore resourceful ? <p> We also stopped at a couple of villages along the river , but few villagers were around due to it being midday , hot , and sporadically rainy . The pigs and roosters were out and about as usual though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do . We were able to catch one woman crafting tassels , which are worn around the neck to jazz up one 's outfit . <p> Our guide then escorted us inside one of the huts , where we joined some villagers who were sitting in a circle around some candles on what appeared to be an altar . We observed for awhile and watched them tying strings around each others ' wrists , not privy to exactly what ritual we were witnessing . Our guide later informed us that one of the villagers had encountered a snake while sleeping last night , and this ceremony was being conducted to ward off evil spirits ( snakes being a bad omen and all ) . We were all invited to tie a string around his wrist as well . <p> After the string tying concluded , all the men passed around a shot glass of whiskey and took turns drinking from it . After the 3 of us had repeatedly rejected their offers , we finally gave in and took a sip to appease them . OH MY GOD LAO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lao Lao I 'm not sure if drinking it straight-up was the way to go . But then they brought out a lunch of sticky rice and 2 different soups , which quickly washed away the aftertaste . <p> Heres what 's so nuts : This village ritual experience was totally spontaneous and only happened due to fortuitous timing and hospitable locals . Inviting random passers-by to a special social gathering is unheard of in America , but in Laos and elsewhere in Asia its a common occurrence . I feel super lucky to have experienced a local custom in Lao . In fact , visiting the villages around Luang Namtha was one of the best experiences I had on my entire 2013 Asia trip . <p> Pin it ! 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of June 2013 <p> The local bus from Huay Xai to Luang Namtha takes about 4 hours and costs 60,000 kip ( $7.50 US ) . <p> A single room at Zuela Guesthouse costs 60,000 kip ( $7.50 US ) per night ; I had bargained them down from 80,000 kip . <p> Bike rental for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rent bikes from most guesthouses or the tourist offices . <p> I paid 350,000 kip ( $45 US ) for a kayaking daytrip through Forest Retreat Laos . Pricing for any activity depends on the number of people who sign up ; there were 3 people on my trip . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> So , the ceremony you experienced at the Lanten villages was a " baci " ceremony and the strings you tie on the persons wrist means your spirit ( signified by the string you tie ) is helping to protect them and give them good luck : ) All Luang Namthas ethnic minority villages are deeply honoured and proud when a westerner comes to visit , it is very common for the visitor to be invited for the celebration , ceremony or just to drink a beer and eat a meal . <p> Thanks for this interesting post . The last sentence alone is already enough to get me there I think . I 'm off to Luang Pranang in 2 days and will prolly end up shopping at Big Brother Mouse and just head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly too ? : D 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Thanks for your feedback glad you enjoyed ! : ) <p> Hope you 're enjoying LP !

@@118792869 @7792869/ <h> Browsing:Featured <p> Not too long ago , I admitted to falling into a travel routine which finds me doing predictable Lindsay-esque things whenever I explore a city , whether new or my own : seeking out the good coffee , walking as much as possible , and being frugal with food and accommodation costs . <p> I always pictured colorful markets , women in conical hats , and people working and living on the river . So not surprisingly , spending time in the Mekong Delta region was an absolute must-do for me and it ended up being one of the highlights of my entire 2013 Asia trip . <p> This probably sounds bad , but I only went to Cambodia to kill time until my broken camera was fixed . While I was in Bangkok , Canon told me they 'd likely complete the repair in 1-2 weeks , so I figured it made the most sense to hop over to Cambodia , loop through Siem Reap Phnom Penh Sihanoukville , and then back around through Thailand and into Bangkok . 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

The payoff was way too alluring to resist : getting to experience Maya Bay ( aka where the movie The Beach took place ) without hoards of tourists . I desperately wanted to see Maya Bay , but the thought of having such a magical place tainted by a tourist circus was almost enough to deter me from going there . <p> Enter the Maya Bay Sleep Aboard . Formerly an overnight camping trip on the beach ( til permits were revoked at the end of 2012 ) , you can now snorkel and swim with bioluminescent plankton in the bay , hang out on the beach after all the tourists have gone for the day , then sleep under the stars on the boat . Um can I get a " yes , please " ? <p> Just after departing at 3pm , we passed by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly comes up with an " Err 30 " on the screen . Ah no worries , I figure it 'll go away if I swap out the battery , lens , or memory card . <p> Except the error persisted . I ca n't take any pictures . NOW I 'm worried . I 'm about to see one of the most beautiful things I 'll EVER see in my life , and I do n't have a working camera to document it . This might be a slight disappointment for anyone , but for a professional photographer ? I felt lost without my camera as if my child had fallen i 'll . And there was n't a damned thing I could do about it until we were back on the mainland . <p> Without my camera to tinker with , I sat back on the top deck of the boat and observed my fellow passengers . At least half were only onboard for a few hours to swim with the plankton and have dinner , while the rest of us were staying overnight . I eyed a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt-niece ? ) duo , 2 British girls , and 2 guys ( one with pretty eyes , the other with really nice arms ) on my side of the deck . <p> I then realized that I was likely the only solo traveler on this boat . Everyone else seemed to be paired off or immersed in their group of friends . All I had was my broken camera . <p> By the time we reached Maya Bay , the sky had become completely overcast . I 'm normally not one for snorkeling , but I thought what the hell my camera died , I 'm alone , and it 's going to rain in about 30 seconds . I 'M GOING SNORKELING . There was n't much reef to be seen , but at least it was warmer in the water than on the windy boat . <p> We then all piled into smaller boats that took us to shore for dinner and chill time . My shirt was still soaked in sweat from earlier , my sarong was soaked from seawater , and the only other clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to get wet in the rain ) , so I was the only one rocking a bathing suit and shorts all night . Excellent . No camera , no clothes , I was on a roll . BUT AT LEAST I WAS N'T SEASICK ! <p> It was still raining once we were on the island . I started wondering if this trip would get any better cause let 's be real , so far things were n't going so well for me . Fortunately there was a nice overhang on some of the rock by the beach that kept us shielded from the rain . I snagged a small log under it to sit on and was soon joined by Pretty Eyes and Hot Arms . Turns out they were 2 in a group of 8 South Africans traveling together . Pretty Eyes steered the conversation , but then he randomly got up and walked away which was when Hot Arms swooped in . We were getting along so well that I hardly noticed when the rain stopped . Then he mentioned that he had accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I like to see it ? Whether this was subtle code or solely about the viewpoint , I was down to accompany him on a frolic through the woods . <p> And , well let 's just say I read the signals right ; ) <p> The rest of the night we were inseparable . We talked nonstop , shared some infamous Thai buckets ( FREE on this boat trip ! ) , and hung out with his crew while our guide played some acoustic guitar for us . And they served us TWO dinners ! I was too full from the curry from dinner #1 to have any of the BBQ in dinner #2 , but it all looked delicious . Unbelievably , the rain held off for the rest of the night . Hot Arms and I hung out on the empty beach and watched the tide bring in random bits of glowing plankton . It was so incredibly beautiful . Talk about my trip doing a complete 180 ! <p> Around 11pm , we all went back to the boat in the middle of the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plankton ( i.e. plankton that glows ) . Whenever we moved our arms and legs around underwater , we 'd see thousands of little glitter-bubbles generated . The experience was pretty incredible on its own , but I think I was even more impressed with the starry sky we were swimming beneath . I had n't seen so many stars since the Outback and I just could n't get enough . I 'm pretty sure I was looking up at the sky more often than down at the water , but everything around me was glowing . Hell , I 'm sure *I* was glowing too . <p> After our night swim , we all hung out on the boat for a bit , then most of us went to sleep while a small group partied into the night on the other side of the deck . I had been slightly concerned that I 'd signed up for a party boat trip , but thankfully no one went too crazy ! ( I hear there are actual party boat trips you can book around Ko Phi Phi , so maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was obviously NOT a very comfortable sleep , given that you 're on a moving boat on a thin mat but you know this when you sign up for the trip . I barely slept at all , but I quite liked looking up at the gradually-changing scenery as the boat slowly floated around where it was anchored in the bay . It went from rock silhouettes to stars to clouds to the sun lightening up the sky at sunrise . <p> The next morning , we went to shore again just as all the tourists began to arrive . We had some chill time there ( this time , in the daylight ) and I took the obligatory iPhone shots , dying inside a little thinking about what magic I could be making with my REAL camera . All things considered , I think I handled the death of my camera extremely well . Its all about keeping things in perspective .

Likely you wont be needing the camera much at night anyway , and you 'll be done by early morning . <p> And agreed the best camera is the one you have on you !

Did you book directly via their website ( http : //www.mayabaytours.com ) ? Thank you ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Hey there ! Yes , the trip starts upon boarding the boat at Phi Phi , so you 'll need to find your own way to get from Phuket to Phi Phi . Its pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I 'm thinking about how I could do that logistically , as I do n't  have a waterproof case for my DSLR. 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Oh good question ! I had one of those waterproof dry bags with me to put my camera in . I reckon you 'd be fine taking that with you from the boat , to the little long tail boat that takes you in to shore ( you do n't  have to swim with it ! ) . <p> This is an awesome post , thanks for sharing ! I was wondering what the bathrooms were like and how clean was the water on the boat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big water bottle too ) . Also how were the bathrooms on the boat and are there lots of mosquitoes ? <p> Uf , I cant really recall these details ! We definitely had filtered water to drink , though .

@@118792872 @7792872/ <h> Bingeing on Beaches and Wine in Southwest Australia <p> These are the things Southwest Australia is most known for . With plenty of time and money , you could afford to sample the best of the region via all of them . But as a time-constrained broke backpacker , I chose to experience Southwest Australia through two filters : beaches and wine . Which worked out super well because not only are these two of my favorite things in life , but also : in Southwest Australia , they happen to be both awesome and free . <h> Busselton <p> About 2 hours south of Perth , we hit Bunbury : the gateway to Southwest Australia . Bunbury , Busselton , and Dunsborough are the main towns along Geographe Bay , which is a prime spot for dolphin watching ( and whale watching , if you 're there September-December ) . We saw a few dolphins in Busselton and stayed to watch the sunset . <h> Yallingup <p> Just southwest of Geographe Bay is Yallingup , a little surf town on the ocean owning some seriously scenic coastline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , watched a surfer , and dipped our toes in the soft dunes . <p> At sunset , we drove down the road to the Canal Rocks . These granite rock outcrops are positioned such that there is a straight waterway running through them a canal of sorts . With limited sunlight left , we did n't see much of the rocks or the surrounding rock pools ; instead , we saw their silhouette against an electric orange sky . I think I 'm ok with it . <h> Margaret River <p> I already divulged the nitty gritty on most of my adventures in Margaret River , but to sum them up : We did a DIY cycling wine tour , died and went to oaked Chardonnay heaven , and got slightly sidetracked by coffee and chocolate tastings along the way . <p> The wineries in Margaret River are responsible for over 20% of Australias premium wine market . Considering the region only produces 3% of the countrys grapes , that 's a massive return on investment and speaks volumes on the quality of wine that comes out of Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also does a fantastic Cabernet Sauvignon and a solid Shiraz if you fancy red wine . <p> Our Margaret River culinary sampling did n't end there , though : we cruised down Harmans Mill Road and gorged on cheese from the Margaret River Dairy Company , nibbled on trail mix from Margaret River Nuts and Cereal , and had a generous helping of chocolate liqueur from Providore . Looking back , I really wish we 'd skipped these extra tastings and spent the last of our good weather frolicking on beaches . They 'd have been fine on their own I think , but after an epic day cycling and wine tasting in Margaret River it felt like a joke . I mean really : why bother stopping to sample trail mix when you could be sipping on the best wine around ? Especially when most wine tastings here are FREE ! <p> I do n't typically pay much attention to food on this blog , but one note on restaurants in Margaret River : they are expensive , and they are delicious . This is not a town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high quality dishes here . Not knowing this , Anna and I sat down to dinner at Swings Taphouse and Kitchen , each ordered one dish , and spent a bit more than we normally would on a meal out . While the food was great , the portions were so tiny that we left feeling like we had n't gotten much for our money . To dine out in Margaret River right , you 've got to go big or go home : make it a splurge and order multiple courses with a glass of local wine . Otherwise , stick to homemade pasta and tuna wraps if you 're a babe on a budget . <p> I 'm not sure which I loved more : the wine or the beaches in Margaret River . Thankfully there was no need for me to decide , as both are free and prevalent throughout the region . We drove to Prevelly Beach and River Mouth to check out the Margaret River coastline and somehow there were hardly any other people there . I swear , if I lived this close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL THE TIME ( like how I was when I lived in Bondi Beach ) . <p> Here I experienced an awestruck feeling similar to what I felt while exploring Tasmania 's beaches : how can water this blue , and sand this white , exist outside of the tropics ? ! I still do n't fully get it , but my god is Australia a magical place . <h> Hamelin Bay <p> Just south of Margaret River , you can spot sting rays in shallow water at the Hamelin Bay beach . Unless it 's windy and overcast , in which case you are n't likely to see much at all . We were super bummed to have visited on a drizzly day no sting rays in clear blue water for us ! <h> Augusta <p> The southwestern-most point of Australia hosts a lighthouse ( which you have to pay to get close to ) , and oodles of whales from June-August each year . Though our visit fell within this timeframe , we did n't spot any whales on this dreary day . We DID spot a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't for naught . <h> Denmark <p> Our streak of crappy weather continued as we hit the southern coast of Southwest Australia . In lieu of checking out Denmark 's glorious beaches , we settled for an afternoon playing with exotic Aussie animals at the Denmark Alpaca Farm . All the ridiculous fun we were having there nearly canceled out our disappointment in the lack of beach weather nearly . <p> The second the sun started poking through the clouds , we beelined to William Bay National Park . It still was n't quite beach weather , but in my book the beach is never a bad idea . Greens Pool and Elephant Rocks were beautiful all the same . If you 're in Denmark on a sunny day , definitely make a point to hit these two stunning beaches ; Greens Pool is meant to be a fabulous swimming spot ! <p> Elephant Rocks in Denmark , Australia . <p> Greens Pool in Denmark , Australia . <p> Greens Pool in Denmark , Australia . <h> Albany <p> Our designated beach day in Albany was blessed with partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive east of town to Two Peoples Bay . One of the helpful staff at our hostel told us the beaches there would be stunning no matter the weather , which lifted our slightly-deflated spirits . <p> By some miracle , the clouds parted for a few minutes upon our arrival at Little Beach and lit up the blue water and WE WERE THE HAPPIEST ! I still ca n't believe our lucky timing here . Had we arrived a few minutes later , we would n't have witnessed how beautiful this Albany beach can be . <p> By the time we 'd traversed Little Beach and climbed up the headland to Waterfall Beach , the sun had gone back into hiding . Sure , it 's still pretty , but I think there 's a very clear difference between how a beach looks in the sun vs how it looks in the clouds . I prefer my beach water to be blue over green , thankyouverymuch ! <h> The Bottom Line <p> If you 're traveling in Oz , consider planning a roadtrip in Southwest Australia . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tourists make it to . Just be sure to allot extra time in case the weather does n't  cooperate ; unlike perpetually sunny Perth , the weather in Southwest Australia is fickle . <p> If you have a week or less , I 'd recommend sticking to either Margaret River OR Denmark/Albany you really need at least 2 weeks to do this whole region justice . Remember to factor in the travel time between towns ( e.g. Margaret River to Albany takes nearly 5 hours ! ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

After a tumultuous transition from winter to spring in New York , all I wanted was to feel the heat from the sun again , to be able to enjoy nature outside of the city grid . <p> 4 days exploring Utah on my own was exactly what I needed . I cashed in some of my credit card points and booked a free flight to Salt Lake City , then rented a car and drove down to Moab to explore Canyonlands , Arches , and surrounds . I hiked , I camped , I canyoneered it was everything I 'd hoped this trip would be . <p> Ill be sharing the photos I took with my real camera in future posts , but for now here 's a taste of Moab via my Utah instagram feed . <p> I flew in to Salt Lake City late Thursday night , then made the long drive down the Moab the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan : nowhere to stay , ready to go wherever the wind takes me . I grabbed a coffee at Moab Coffee Roasters and furiously plotted my next move . The next thing I knew , I was hobbling down the street with a newly-sprained toe . FAN-TASTIC . <p> No way was I going to let a little pain and discomfort mess with my desert adventure , so I carried on to Sand Flats Recreation Area to try to grab a campsite the weekend . They were full thanks to the Easter Jeep Safari , and I was going to turn around but then I saw THIS and on impulse decided to spend the rest of the afternoon frolicking here . <p> Snow AND sand , how stunning is this scene ? ! I could n't help but be seduced . <p> I drove around , then came upon the start of the Slickrock Bike Trail . Like a moth to a flame , I limped onto the 1.7 mile practice loop and photographed the bejesus out of it . Its definitely a new goal of mine to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ride the famous Slickrock . Despite its name , this kind of rock actually takes very well to rubber , both bike tires and shoe soles . <p> Saturday began with a little rain , but thankfully it cleared up in time for me to explore Canyonlands National Park . It reminded me a lot of the Grand Canyon : less majestic but more varied in landscape . Ai n't  no arches in the Grand Canyon ! <p> Opting to stay off my injured foot as much as possible , I went viewpoint hopping at the Island in the Sky district of the park . I stopped at all the major viewpoints and many others as well , spending a minimum of 30 minutes at each doing nothing more than soaking up the scene and staring off into it . I could n't get over the silence coming from NYC , I 'd forgotten what that sounded like . Evidently Canyonlands was named one of the quietest places in all of the United States . <p> On Sunday morning , I rose before sunrise and headed into town for a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first rappel , then hiked to our next one and I all but freaked out upon seeing this view . I was having MAJOR happy flashbacks to the Outback specifically Kata Tjuta . <p> Our second rappel was just to the left of Morning Glory Bridge ( above ) . Ill never forget the feeling of twirling around in the air beneath this arch what a natural high ! It was also a swift kick in the tush to maybe consider investing in a GoPro . I 'm not really into movies , either making or watching them , but sometimes a photo does n't  quite do justice to an experience . <p> Driving back from our outing , we passed by what looked like a couple of campgrounds on the Colorado River . I thought that maybe I could snag a campsite with all the Jeep Safari folks heading out of town , and sure enough I found one at Drinks Canyon . I could have spent the rest of the day hanging out on the river , basking in the sun . Oh god the sun ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But alas , Arches National Park was calling . I quickly got sidetracked by the Park Avenue trail , which I hiked in flip flops because I could n't get a proper shoe on my swollen foot . These towering rocks were beautifully lit up by the midday sun , but by 4:00 or so the shadows started creeping in . I did n't  even make it to any arches til late afternoon oops ! <p> In contrast to the near-empty Park Avenue trail , the Windows section of the park was crawling with visitors . I did an obligatory loop around the North and South Window , then continued on my way . <p> I opted not to do the 3 mile hike to Delicate Arch for sunset as I 'd originally intended , so as not to completely murder my toe . Instead , I took a shorter trail to a viewpoint and saw a teeny-tiny version of the arch from below . <p> On Monday , my last day in Utah , I drove the 60 mile La Sal Loop through the forest and mountains on a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , I officially count this as one of my greatest driving accomplishments . Naturally , I paused every so often to take in the view of the town from above . The La Sal mountains are a popular launching-off point for mountain bike rides down into Moab . Along with Slickrock , I 'm coming back to take this trail on someday ! <p> As I was descending the mountain , I noticed a bright blue body of water behind the red rocks and wondered what the heck it was . Kens Lake , a desert reservoir , is what it was . Pretty cool to see , but there were some awful bugs hanging out there so I quickly snapped some photos and left . <p> Before heading back to Salt Lake City I had to stop at Wicked Brew , a drive-thru coffee bar . Best coffee in Moab , you heard it here . They even leave a chocolate covered espresso bean on top of your to-go cup ! <p> I endured an exhausting 4.5 hours driving up to Salt Lake , then immediately ditched the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life at Omars Rawtopia ( try the honey basil ! ) , followed by another frivolous cup of coffee at Alchemy before my red eye back to NYC .

For example : for just $4.50 US you can catch a train to Katoomba and quite literally walk into the Blue Mountains . Camping , hiking , canyoning , rock climbing , all this close to the city ? Amazing ! Or : for around $100 US , you can hop on a bus up to Hunter Valley for the day and embark on a wine tour without having to worry about driving yourself around while boozing . <p> As my days in Sydney were rapidly drawing to a close , I realized I 'd better cool it on all the beach bumming and coastal walking if I actually wanted to see anything outside of the city before I left . I ended up only having time for one last day trip at the end , but I skipped the mountains and the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting up to Sydney 's Northern Beaches had sat high on my Sydney to-do list for months , but the thought of schlepping up there via public transport and spending 4-5 hours total on a bus kept it from getting crossed off said list .

Off we went to Palm Beach ! <h> Sydney 's Northern Beaches <p> Loosely defined , the Northern Beaches are all the oceanside beaches north of Sydney Harbour , from Manly Beach north to Palm Beach . These neighborhoods are considered to be the northern suburbs of Sydney ; beyond Palm Beach begins what 's called the Central Coast . ( And just for comparison 's sake , oceanside beaches like Bondi , Coogee , and Maroubra are located south of Sydney Harbour , in the eastern suburbs ) <p> You might be wondering as I once was , why the bloody hell would you want to go out of my way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick bus or train to 100 other closer beaches in Sydney ? <p> In a nutshell : Sydney 's Northern Beaches have a much different feel to them .

The towns have one main street running through them and are largely populated by affluent families in sizable homes . <p> I do n't know about you , but that 's more than enough for me to deem it worth the effort of getting there ! <h> Palm Beach <p> We figured we 'd start at the northern-most point at Palm Beach and work our way down to some of the other Northern Beaches . But Palm Beach charmed the pants off us so much ( quite literally ) that we ended up staying there all afternoon . <p> First , we walked along Pittwater , the bay on the other side of the peninsula . There 's an underwhelming beach here , but a better reason to come to this side is for the boating and fishing neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand and did some rock scrambling , then took the path up to Barrenjoey Lighthouse .

They guarantee you 'll be standing up during your first lesson , which I can vouch for being true ( at least for me ! ) . <p> Surf lessons on Siargao are- such incredible value for money , especially given the quality of the surf around the island. - Kermits surf accommodation packages are even- better value , if you can believe it , because they also include other goodies like meals , yoga , and excursions . <h> Stand- Up Paddleboarding in Siargao <p> If surfing is n't your thing , you can still have fun on a board by taking yourself on- a stand up paddleboarding adventure . <p> Both Kermit and Lux Boutique Resort have SUP boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lux , you can walk right out onto the resort beach and paddle out to the nearby mangroves ; at Kermit , you 'll have to transport the board to the beach- via motorbike since the resort is a bit inland . <p> If you want to try stand up paddleboarding somewhere with stiller water- than the beach , its worth hopping on either the Sugba Lagoon tour or the Mangrove SUP tour with Kermit . Sugba Lagoon is well worth doing at 2000 PHP ( US$40 ) : its nearly a full day trip and includes a delicious BBQ lunch and drinks . Plus , I mean , look how stinkin gorgeous the place is : <p> SUP at Sugba Lagoon . <p> SUP at Sugba Lagoon is more of a DIY , **27;263;TOOLONG thing , while SUP at the mangroves is actually a guided paddleboarding tour where you 'll have some instruction .

Free diving is also meant to be particularly excellent around Siargao with- the fantastic visibility . <p> A one-tank dive with all equipment included costs 1800PHP ( US$36 ) with Palaka Dive Center ( the dive shop I had planned on diving with ) . <h> Swimming &amp; Cliff Jumping On- Siargao <p> Ok , so you 're basically swimming in- all of the previously mentioned- outdoor adventures , but I had to find a way to include the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals these incredible tidal pools with the clearest , bluest water imaginable .

You can either rent a motorbike and drive yourself there or pay about 1000PHP ( US$20 ) to have someone drive you there and back .

We picked right back up from where we left off 5 years ago , and I reluctantly departed with a silent declaration that someday I 'll live there . <p> My San Francisco instagram feed was flooded with artsy coffee cups , bridges , and city skyline views as I frolicked around the city .

There was a bit of fog , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially loved the view of the Marin Headlands from it , though we endured some ridiculous winds to see it . <p> For the first couple days , I did the hostel thing ; then for the second half of my stay , I upgraded *slightly* to the InterContinental Mark Hopkins Hotel . Thank you , fancy work conference . My room was super comfortable , and the view from the Top of the Mark bar on the 19th floor was TO DIE FOR . <p> While I did revisit a few of my favorite SF spots , like the Painted Ladies at Alamo Square ( yes , the Full House houses ) , I also made an effort to check out a few new spots .

It 's the inside that counts anyway , right ? <p> I found my phone and I got picked up and driven home in the end , but either way it was worth the mild stress I suffered because HOLY WANDJINA , this was one of the most beautiful hikes I 've ever done . <p> There are lots of gorge hikes at El Questro Wilderness Park with well-marked trails , but there are also a few more difficult ones that you could only manage if you or someone you were hiking with knew the way . One of these is the hike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle turnoff just after Marker #2 on the trail to Emma Gorge . From here , you cross the creek and immediately start the long , steep , rocky climb above the gorge . <p> At the top , there 's actually a footpath you can follow for a bit that goes further around the gorge , but the tricky part is knowing when to veer off it and start going downhill . There are zero trail markers to indicate this diversion . The right way will see you cutting through bush and soon emerging on a rock platform with approximately this view : <p> From here , you can glimpse Wandjinas Window below and to the left , and the pools of water at the G-Spot even further below and to the right . <p> It 's not too much further to get down to Wandjinas . There 's some fun downhill rock climbing and then soon the rock windowframe will come into partial view ; a bit more bushwalking and you 'll pop right out into the frame . <p> How killer would it be to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grueling to have to lug all your camping gear up that rocky cliff at the beginning and through the bush afterwards , but totally worth it to lay your swag out and light a campfire right here . <p> Instead , I contentedly settled for digging into my peanut butter sandwich while we sat for awhile and soaked in the vista . <p> I could have turned around and headed back after seeing Wandjinas Window ( or so I thought ) , but the others with me were determined to reach the G-Spot : aptly named because it 's quite hard to find the way down into it . I tagged along at the rear as we trudged through prickly bush that tore up all our legs ( note to future self and all y'all : wear long pants on this hike ! ) . We were on no semblance of a path for 90% of this segment . There were a few points that were so slippery that we had to slide downhill on our arses to avoid a fall . Getting there was n't pretty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by one big pool just beneath Wandjinas Window , containing water that had flowed down from it ( during the dry season , it 's just a trickle of water falling ; during the wet , it 's a proper waterfall ) . <p> While it looked to be a fun little swimming hole , complete with a boulder to jump off of , the whole thing was covered in shade by the time we arrived . So we opted to carry on further : past a thinner pool laced with neon green something-or-other , and to a smaller , shallow pool in full sunlight just by the edge . Wed traversed the G-Spot and made it to the very top of the waterfall at Emma Gorge ! It was so surreal looking down at all the people swimming in it ; even moreso to think that I have been one of these people twice before , blissfully unaware of the Eden-like landscape that existed just above . <p> I 'd been looking forward to a swim all morning , but once we arrived at the top of Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun . I awoke refreshed and made a point to fully absorb my surroundings : the three pools , the surrounding rock formations , Emma Gorge below , the views leading out into the Cockburn landscape beyond the gorge and the main road . <p> Looking down into Emma Gorge . <p> We took a different route back and made a loop instead of backtracking , missed the unmarked turnoff a few times , but eventually made it back by late afternoon . Nevermind that our ride back to El Questro Station would n't come for another 5.5 hours we had successfully looked through Wandjinas Window and found the G-Spot , and it was damn near orgasmic. 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

You come here to eat , drink , and soak up the culture . <p> During my 6 months living in Melbourne , I entertained myself in other ways one of which was seeking out the best locations from which to view the city . Melbournes modest skyline can be ogled from several spots around the city and its suburbs , the best of which Ive rounded up in the list below ! <h> Melbourne Star <p> I took a ride on Melbournes cheesiest tourist attraction on an impulse one day when I happened to be in the area . I 'm not saying its necessarily worth the AU$35 admission , but it did provide a unique perspective of the city from the very top of the wheel . Views are nowhere near as good anywhere below the top , though . <p> Pro tip : You can often find deals for the Melbourne Star on Groupon , and those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skydeck <p> The Eureka Skydeck is another tourist hotspot , but believe me : this is one you wo n't want to miss . The 360-degree views at the top are fantastic and well worth the AU$20 admission price . <p> Pro tip : Go for the Sun &amp; Stars upgrade for just $5.50 more if you 're able to make 2 visits in 2 days , and go once during the day and once around sunset . <h> Birrarung Marr Park <p> Birrarung Marr is the site of many a market , festival , and event held in Melbourne ( recommended : the Night Noodle Markets &amp; White Night &lt;3 ) . But when it 's not moonlighting in the special occasion department , it 's a pretty excellent place to hang out on the hill overlooking the Yarra and the CBD . And if you 're a nerd like me , you can watch the trains crawl into Flinders Street Station nearby . <h> Footscray Community Arts Centre <p> I 'd heard something about the fetching city views from this seemingly random spot in Melbournes western suburbs , and when I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held there , I brought my camera along for it . The center is lodged on a hill providing just enough height to glimpse the city above the riverfront trees . <h> Yarra River <p> In my opinion , the best views of Melbourne can be enjoyed right on the Yarra River . I never tired of strolling the banks and crossing all of the bridges there . If you 'd rather relax , there are loads of bars and cafes situated on the river where you can sit and enjoy the view ; alternatively , you can adopt my frugal approach and sit on the docks with a homemade snack . <p> Pro tip : For more exceptional views of Melbourne from the Yarra , book a Melbourne River Cruise ( AU$29 , or half price if you can find a cut-out coupon in the local visitors guide booklet ) , or grab a drink at Ponyfish Island nestled just below the Southgate Pedestrian Bridge . <h> Williamstown <p> Williamstown is slightly removed from central Melbourne , but you could easily wile away an afternoon exploring this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor . <h> Naked For Satan <p> Tourists and locals alike go crazy over this rooftop bar in Fitzroy . Naked For Satan is hip , serves delicious tapas and cocktails , and offers some of the best northside city views . I do n't  think the views of Melbourne are as good as the other locations on this list , but it deserves a mention because its something a little different ( and plus , its awesome ) . <h> Elwood <p> Forget St. Kilda instead , head a bit further south along the pedestrian path to Elwood and enjoy the view of Melbourne from the point where the path curves outward . Here you 'll find a stretch of rocks along the shore and a distant view of the city . <p> Pro tip : Climb up the nearby hill for an even better view ! <h> Shrine of Remembrance <p> Just south of the Yarra and right by the Royal Botanic Gardens you 'll find the Shrine of Remembrance , where you can walk up to the second floor for some 360-degree views of the city and southern suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as good . <p> Pro tip : Visit in the early morning hours , before the sun rises too high and washes out the view looking toward the city . <h> Eastern Suburbs <p> This ones a bit of a wildcard , because why on earth would you head to the eastern suburbs just for a view of Melbourne ? They do n't  offer waterfront vistas like Williamstown or Elwood do , but because they 're on a hill you can actually see the city quite clearly . <p> I spent some time living in Doncaster and Camberwell and there were a few spots on my frequent walks in those suburbs where I stopped in my tracks at the sight of the city skyline . <h> Other Views of Melbourne <p> I had a few other spots on my Melbourne to-do list that I hope to be able to cross off and add to this post in the future : <p> Hot Air Balloon Theres said to be no better way to start your day in Melbourne than taking a sunrise hot air balloon ride over the city . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it get any better ?

Without hesitation , question , or research , I said hells yeah . Because is there anything- more glorious than exploring Sydney by boat ? ( NOPE ! ) <p> I was- super busy at the time it was when all my visa nonsense came to a head , and I was about to leave town for Melbourne and then the US , so the boat trip did n't  happen . But the second I felt settled into my new place in Sydney , I reached back out to them and finally scheduled my Sydney Harbour boat trip . <p> Imagine my surprise when this gorgeous little boat pulled up to the wharf ! Carly and I looked at each other like , is this ride for us ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have realized- that our ride , La Dolce Vita , would be- a- sexy Italian wooden speedboat . Hyperbole aside , there is no other boat like it on Sydney Harbour . <p> I mean , we were already pretty stoked for our afternoon on Sydney Harbour , but this took our excitement level up a few notches . We hopped in at Darling Harbour and began our speedboat adventure ! <p> Our skipper , Any Boat owner Daniel , asked us straight away where we wanted to go and whether we had any requests. - To be honest , neither of us had our hearts set on any particular bay in the harbour we were just thrilled to be out there on the water ! <p> I did ask- if they had a set- route that they typically take- guests on , though . Because what kind of article- would this be if I got to zip around Sydney Harbour on a- special , customized boat trip while other guests did n't  have that option ? ( Answer : not very compelling ) . - Daniel assured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , and can even opt to be dropped off for awhile at a secluded beach on the harbour ( By the way , you should totally do that if you 're new to Sydney and/or have limited time . The hidden beaches around Sydney Harbour are one of the best things about Sydney ! ) . <p> Ultimately we had him take us on their most popular route around the southern bays , just east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge : Woolloomooloo , Double Bay , Point Piper , and Rose Bay . <p> BUT FIRST : the majestic , glorious , and downright magical Sydney Opera House from every which angle ! <p> Aside from having an absurd-looking name , Woolloomooloo also possesses a fancy-pants wharf on which- Russell Crowe happens to own a multi-million dollar penthouse . NO BIG DEAL . <p> Fun fact : that boat in the middle supposedly belongs to Russell Crowe ! And his penthouse is on the wharf just behind it . <p> If you want to gawk at some of Sydneys finest real estate , you could do worse than wandering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the most expensive residential street in all of Australia . We slowed the boat down to allow ample time for gawking and jaw-dropping . <p> Fun fact #2 : I have hung out inside the penthouse in the top-right of that Point Piper apartment building in the middle ! Why oh why wasnt I in Sydney last year for their NYE party ? <p> From Rose Bay , we headed back toward Circular Quay along the northern reaches- of the harbour . I do n't  really have any photos of Rose Bay as- I was feeling a tiny bit queasy around this part of the boat trip. - I almost always forget to pack my motion sickness pills or wristbands because I 'm the worst ( see : Kauai Helicopter Tour , Whitsundays Sailing Trip , Phillip Island Jet Boat , Grand Canyon Scenic Flight ) . This was nowhere near close to the motion sickness I suffered on those outings , though .

Its also where Any Boats other boats are moored , and where their head office is located . <p> Daniel pointed out several of their other boats , which can hold anywhere from 4 to 200 guests . Some of them , like La Dolce Vita , are typically used for transfers around the harbour ; others tend to be hired for special occasions , or for large group outings ( party boat anyone ? ) . <p> La Dolce Vita is often booked for wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in style ! <p> Carly and I werent getting transported to a wedding , but we still had a fantastic time touring Sydney Harbour on La Dolce Vita .

They have an extensive collection of other boats available for hire as well , many of which can accommodate a large number of guests ( hence making it a very affordable day out when you split the cost between several people ) . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118792916 @7792916/ <h> Chasing The Petronas Twin Towers <p> In all my globetrotting , I 've surprisingly never had a long layover while in transit . Back when I worked corporate jobs with 3 weeks paid leave a year , I always wanted to maximize the time spent at my destination rather than fritter away an extra day in transit . <p> But now that I 've escaped the cubicle and have the luxury of time , I 've changed my tune a bit . I think long layovers are perfect for getting a taste of a city that you probably would n't make an effort to travel to otherwise .

If I were ever to return to KL , I 'm fairly certain I 'd flee the city and try to get close to those . <h> View From KLCC Park <p> Right below the Petronas Towers is KLCC Park , which you might as well amble through while you 're in the neighborhood . You can enjoy an close-up view of the towers- from near the footbridge . <h> View From The Traders Hotel SkyBar <p> If you have limited time to visit the Petronas Twin Towers , skip the tour and the park and head straight across to- the Traders Hotel .

@@118792918 @7792918/ <h> Things To Love About Brunswick , Melbourne <p> Now that I 've come down from the high of my 3-week tryst with Brunswick , I 'm ready to dish on my love for the Melbourne neighborhood I called home earlier this month . <p> Here are the things I love about Brunswick : <h> Awesome Location <p> Brunswick is located just 6km ( 3.7mi ) north of the Melbourne CBD . It 's close enough to the city center that you can hop on the Upfield train and get there in 15 minutes , catch a tram and make it in under 30 minutes , or walk through Royal Park and Parkville and get there in 1-1.5 hours ( depending on your frolicking pace ) . <p> While Brunswick is close enough to the city that commuting is a non-issue , it 's also far enough away that you can completely separate yourself from the city if you want . With all the residential streets , parks , and thrift stores , it 's easy to forget you 're even in a major city until you glimpse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not surprisingly , a large contingent of Brunswickers are cyclists . The neighborhood caters nicely with its prevalence of bike lanes , bike racks , and signs directing toward major bike routes . There 's even a free tire pump outside of the Jewell train station . <p> Best of all , 3 major bike paths run through Brunswick and towards the city . They 're completely separate from vehicle traffic , only occasionally requiring you to cross busy streets . <p> The Upfield Bike Path runs along the train tracks before hitting the parks , where you can either follow one of the trails through Royal Park or ride directly along the edge of Princes Park . This route is a fabulous mix of grit and street art along the tracks , and greenery through the parks . <p> The Merri Creek Trail passes through East Brunswick , winds its way down the creek to meet the Yarra River where it runs into 1 ) . The Capital City Trail , which will take you south along the river and into the CBD , and 2 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs . This is a more leisurely route to the city , mostly lined by trees and water and speckled periodically with street art and other amusements ( e.g. a children 's farm ) . <p> There 's a path you can access from West Brunswick that runs along Moonee Ponds Creek/Railway Canal and the Citylink ( highway ) . Around Flemington Bridge , it converges with the Capital City Trail which runs straight to Docklands and the CBD . <h> Street Art For Days <p> Melbourne as a whole is stacked with street art , but it 's more prevalent in some neighborhoods more than others . Brunswick is one of them , to the point where there 's almost always some form of street art in sight . It 's on the sides of commercial buildings and homes , along the train tracks , in alleyways pretty much all over the place . <h> More Op Shops Than Regular ' Stores <p> Brunswicks become the go-to place for thrifting in Melbourne . What we Americans call thrift shops , Australians refer to as op shops ( or opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity ) . There 's no better place for a backpacker to snag affordable replacements for the stained , hole-d clothing they 've been toting around for months . Speaking of which , this is still on my to-do list , but keeps getting bumped due to me constantly getting distracted by a certain plentiful caffeinated beverage ( see the next list item below ! ) . <p> For more thrifting and scavenging , be sure to check out the Brunswick Flea ( 2nd Sunday of each month ) and the Lost and Found Market ( every weekend ) . These might be better suited for those living in Melbourne , not just passing through , as they 've got some great antiques , home goods , and kitschy decor for sale perfect for furnishing a home . <h> Spoilt For Choice With Coffee Shops <p> I 'm the first to admit that I judge a neighborhood by its coffee shops . As a digital freelancer , I look for cafes with free wifi , adequate outlets and seating , and excellent coffee . Honest to god , I 've never lived somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet all those criteria . <p> I loved holing up all afternoon with my laptop at : <p> John Gorilla , where I 'd sit out in the courtyard on sunny days <p> Padre Coffee , where I 'd enjoy some of the best coffee around while getting some writing done <p> Acustico , where I 'd seat myself at one of their quirky tables and people watch out the garage door <p> Lux Foundry , where I 'd soak up the aesthetically gorgeous interior and enjoy the smell of breakfast wafting out from the kitchen <p> Acustico : coffee , street art , and cycling all in one ! <h> Endless Bar Selection <p> Admittedly I never got around to trying any of the bars in Brunswick because a ) . I 'm poor , b ) . I 'm not much of a drinker , and c ) . I was too busy cycling and ODing on coffee , but I passed by so many cool bars that I mentally bookmarked for potential future Sunday Sessions : <p> The Railway Hotel Every time I passed by on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always buzzing . Note that this is actually a hostel bar ( not a hotel bar ) , and can get pretty loud especially when there 's live music on weekends . It 's meant to be a great place to meet cool people . <p> Howler A really creative space featuring a modern garden bar , live music , and films . <p> The Penny Black Popular for its cheap pizza and live music . <p> Mi Corazon Tequila Bar I 'm not one for tequila ( usually ) , but this place is just so colorful and has authentic Mexican food ( of which there 's not enough in Melbs ) . <p> In general , if you 're into craft beer , you 'll be in heaven with the Brunswick bar scene . <h> It 's Delightfully Diverse <p> While one might be quick to label Brunswick a hipster nabe , there 's also plenty of families living here . Of course you 'll have the young and hip inhabiting cheap share houses , pursuing their music or other art endeavors and practicing sustainable living .

But what street art in Sydney does exist , tends to be concentrated in Newtown : particularly the little lanes just off of King Street . <p> So if you 're in Sydney and happen to make your way to Newtown , do n't  do what I did when I lived there and just stick to the main road go off and explore the neighborhood ! I 'd recommend wandering around the Newtown/Camperdown border , where nearly every block has some sort of colorful artwork plastered on fences or buildings . <p> While the street art in Sydney is n't quite as polished or ( arguably ) impressive as it is in other cities , I really like how it seems to be more unintentionally collaborative here . Rather than finding one massive , awesome work that takes up an entire building wall , you 're more likely to spot a few starkly different pieces sharing the same space . You can tell that they were all erected by different artists with different media at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty cool , right ? <h> Which is your favorite photo of Sydney street art ? 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> My hood ! Love the street art in Newtown . You should also check out the surrounding suburbs of Enmore and Camperdown , and Surry Hills is also a great place for street art spotting : D 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Yes ! ! Camperdown has lots of great street art . I did n't  see a ton in Surry Hills , but maybe I just hit the wrong streets ?

@@118792922 @7792922/ <h> The Best Of Koh Lanta , Thailand <p> After 2 months of tackling Nepal and India , I was more than ready to catapult myself to the Thai islands for some much-needed beach time . First stop : Koh Lanta ! <p> I spent a week on Koh Lanta : the first half in the north , near Klong Dao and Long Beach ; the second half in the south , at Kantiang Bay . Despite the island spanning about 25km from north to south and me being without transport , I did manage some serious frolicking on my feet , sampling many different beaches , restaurants , and bars along the way . Had I actually been able to handle a motorbike , I 'd have checked out the east coast as well but alas . <p> I wo n't claim to be the definitive source on what 's the absolute BEST of Koh Lanta I 'd need several more weeks to do my research on that . But I can tell you what made MY Best Of Koh Lanta list : <h> Best Meal : Lemongrass Salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Long Beach spot by its big COFFEE sign and comfy seating area overlooking the beach . And both of these things were quite enjoyable . But what unexpectedly knocked my socks off was the innocent lunch I had . Suzies lemongrass salad was DELICIOUS . Slightly spicy , but bearable for a wuss like me . I 'm not even entirely sure what was in it apart from the obvious , but it was fantastic . <h> Best Breakfast Spot : Drunken Sailor <p> This is THE spot to eat a casual meal at Kantiang Bay especially breakfast . Its a cute open-air cafe with tables , hammocks , and bean bag chairs to dine or lounge in . I loved how they had DVDs available for rental and cats wandering around the property . The coffee was easily the best on the island . And the food well , I could have happily ordered just about anything on the menu . The pancakes and eggs get my seal of approval ! <h> Best Drinks : Time For Lime <p> With all the bars and dining establishments on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinks to my guesthouse on Klong Dao Beach . Time For Lime rightly claims to have the best mojito on Koh Lanta I 'd go so far as to say they made the best mojito Ive EVER had . I reckon they use part coconut rum in their mojito recipe , which may be a part of their secret sauce ; ) Time For Lime also makes a phenomenal lemongrass margarita . <h> Best Beach : Nui Bay <p> I accidentally stumbled upon this little cove while walking south from Kantiang Bay . It 's a steep but short walk down to the beach , and seems not to be discovered by the masses yet . It 's got a shipwrecked feeling to it , perhaps in part from the little bar-shack that may or may not currently be in operation . There were a few people hanging out there when I first arrived , but when I went to scope out the shack later on , they were gone and there was no evidence of the bar actually being open for business . Totally a kitschy spot , with shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the roof . I liked the natural seating just outside ( driftwood , stumps , rocks ) and there was even a hammock inside ! Nui Bay is definitely worth seeking out for some private beach time . <h> Best Sunset Spot : Top View Resort at Kantiang Bay <p> Those that ascend the insanely steep driveway to get to the Top View Resort will be rewarded with 180-degree views from huts perched above the Andaman Sea . I stayed in a bungalow here and every night , I 'd come back from a day of beaching and claim a hut at their restaurant to catch the sunset from . This is the best sunset view on Koh Lanta . Even if you 're not staying at the resort , you can stop by for some drinks and dinner and enjoy the amazing view . <h> Best Sight : Koh Lanta National Park <p> I 'll be honest : I was n't wowed by Koh Lanta 's beaches ( Though I think if I 'd actually seen them under blue skies I might feel differently ) . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koh Lanta National Park . It was the most beautiful thing I saw on the island . The rugged coastline , lighthouse , and southern-most beach are best seen from the top of the hill . 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

In a span of 15 days , we roadtripped around the Ring Road ( and beyond ! ) , hung out in Reykjavik , and hiked through the highlands . And for the first time ever in my international travels , I bucked up and bought a local SIM card yup , I threw $12 at the privilege of having social media access while on the road . YOURE WELCOME . <p> In the end I think I instagrammed something like 45 shots from Iceland , which is just a tad too much for one blog post . So to narrow it down a bit , I decided to post my Top 10 most-liked #iceventure14 instagram photos . Thanks to all who followed along on my Iceland adventure and engaged with my instagram feed ! <p> The rain wasted no time in greeting us on Day 1 , but then WE SAW A RAINBOW ! Cue rapid-fire shutter clicking through the car window . <p> After a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westfjords and back , all we really wanted was to relax in a hot pool . Good thing hot pools are about as ubiquitous in Iceland as Starbucks are in any major American city . This one was in quite an idyllic setting : on a hill , nestled just south of a sauna hut and a waterfall . <p> Tempting as it was to instagram the bejesus out of Godafoss main falls , I was even more captivated by the smaller falls and the rock walls to the side of it . Evidently the powers at Matador Network felt similarly , because they decided to feature this photo on their brands instagram feed ! I may have had a minor freakout in a gas station parking lot when I saw it . <p> I knew northern Iceland had plenty of volcanic landscapes to ogle . I did n't  know said landscapes included bright blue pools , but I was pretty ok with it . <p> You want to feel alive ? Stand alone on the edge of a 100m-deep canyon. - Fja+r+rglj+fur was one of my favorite spots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have secretly thought to myself upon pulling up to Sk+gafoss . Youve seen five , you 've seen them all , right ? Well , Iceland said FALSE and threw in a double rainbow for good measure . I have never seen a rainbow this bright and this close in all my ( nearly 30 ) years and you guys ? I really love rainbows . Becca jokes that I have a bit of " gay man " in me for it , but I say ANYONE can have love for these polychromatic displays . <p> Nicki and I had clocked at least three hours of lounging , sauna-ing , and pruning in the Blue Lagoon before we finally got around to taking a few photos of it . Possibly not the brightest idea to wait until just before dark , BUT HEY . We were having way too much fun to worry about instagramming it . <p> Whoa , this is like all my favorite things in one frame : cats , street art , an exclamation point , and a pretty shade of blue/green . Oh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> Ahh , the Laugavegur Trek . I cant even begin to describe the sheer amazingness we encountered along this trail , but I promise I will try to in a future post !

@@118792926 @7792926/ <h> The Best Views of Melbourne <p> While Melbourne is a wonderfully livable city , it is n't a place with many sights or tourist attractions worth boasting about . You come here to eat , drink , and soak up the culture . <p> During my 6 months living in Melbourne , I entertained myself in other ways one of which was seeking out the best locations from which to view the city . Melbournes modest skyline can be ogled from several spots around the city and its suburbs , the best of which Ive rounded up in the list below ! <h> Melbourne Star <p> I took a ride on Melbournes cheesiest tourist attraction on an impulse one day when I happened to be in the area . I 'm not saying its necessarily worth the AU$35 admission , but it did provide a unique perspective of the city from the very top of the wheel . Views are nowhere near as good anywhere below the top , though . <p> Pro tip : You can often find deals for the Melbourne Star on Groupon , and those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skydeck <p> The Eureka Skydeck is another tourist hotspot , but believe me : this is one you wo n't want to miss . The 360-degree views at the top are fantastic and well worth the AU$20 admission price . <p> Pro tip : Go for the Sun &amp; Stars upgrade for just $5.50 more if you 're able to make 2 visits in 2 days , and go once during the day and once around sunset . <h> Birrarung Marr Park <p> Birrarung Marr is the site of many a market , festival , and event held in Melbourne ( recommended : the Night Noodle Markets &amp; White Night &lt;3 ) . But when it 's not moonlighting in the special occasion department , it 's a pretty excellent place to hang out on the hill overlooking the Yarra and the CBD . And if you 're a nerd like me , you can watch the trains crawl into Flinders Street Station nearby . <h> Footscray Community Arts Centre <p> I 'd heard something about the fetching city views from this seemingly random spot in Melbournes western suburbs , and when I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held there , I brought my camera along for it . The center is lodged on a hill providing just enough height to glimpse the city above the riverfront trees . <h> Yarra River <p> In my opinion , the best views of Melbourne can be enjoyed right on the Yarra River . I never tired of strolling the banks and crossing all of the bridges there . If you 'd rather relax , there are loads of bars and cafes situated on the river where you can sit and enjoy the view ; alternatively , you can adopt my frugal approach and sit on the docks with a homemade snack . <p> Pro tip : For more exceptional views of Melbourne from the Yarra , book a Melbourne River Cruise ( AU$29 , or half price if you can find a cut-out coupon in the local visitors guide booklet ) , or grab a drink at Ponyfish Island nestled just below the Southgate Pedestrian Bridge . <h> Williamstown <p> Williamstown is slightly removed from central Melbourne , but you could easily wile away an afternoon exploring this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor . <h> Naked For Satan <p> Tourists and locals alike go crazy over this rooftop bar in Fitzroy . Naked For Satan is hip , serves delicious tapas and cocktails , and offers some of the best northside city views . I do n't  think the views of Melbourne are as good as the other locations on this list , but it deserves a mention because its something a little different ( and plus , its awesome ) . <h> Elwood <p> Forget St. Kilda instead , head a bit further south along the pedestrian path to Elwood and enjoy the view of Melbourne from the point where the path curves outward . Here you 'll find a stretch of rocks along the shore and a distant view of the city . <p> Pro tip : Climb up the nearby hill for an even better view ! <h> Shrine of Remembrance <p> Just south of the Yarra and right by the Royal Botanic Gardens you 'll find the Shrine of Remembrance , where you can walk up to the second floor for some 360-degree views of the city and southern suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as good . <p> Pro tip : Visit in the early morning hours , before the sun rises too high and washes out the view looking toward the city . <h> Eastern Suburbs <p> This ones a bit of a wildcard , because why on earth would you head to the eastern suburbs just for a view of Melbourne ? They do n't  offer waterfront vistas like Williamstown or Elwood do , but because they 're on a hill you can actually see the city quite clearly . <p> I spent some time living in Doncaster and Camberwell and there were a few spots on my frequent walks in those suburbs where I stopped in my tracks at the sight of the city skyline . <h> Other Views of Melbourne <p> I had a few other spots on my Melbourne to-do list that I hope to be able to cross off and add to this post in the future : <p> Hot Air Balloon Theres said to be no better way to start your day in Melbourne than taking a sunrise hot air balloon ride over the city . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it get any better ?

I do n't  usually do touristy stuff , but I might pop into a museum if the mood strikes " . BLECH . Cmon , I can do better ! <p> As much as I like to turn my nose up at the thought of routine , the truth is there 's comfort in the familiar . I like taking on an unfamiliar place with a ( rough ) plan and filling in the blanks as I go . Its an ideal blend of comfort and adventure , routine and spontaneity . <p> So yes , I admit it I have a travel routine . I take on any new city with the same approach , which typically looks something like this : <h> I do my research <p> As much as I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's be real I 'm a planner . BUT BUT BUT , I 'm all about LOOSE planning . I plan just enough to give myself a bit of direction , then see what I feel like doing in real time . I may read my travel guidebooks cover to cover before a trip , but I rarely touch them while I 'm actually traveling . <p> I like to keep a running list of things I might like to do and where to find them . Most of my notes are saved in my iPhone , jotted down either before my trip or at night while I decompress and prepare for the next day of adventuring . <p> When I 'm traveling outside of the US , I cant rely on a data plan or wifi to check my directions on Google Maps while I 'm on the go , so I 've usually got a bunch of screen shots saved as photos in case I get a little too lost as was the case in Montreal : <h> I find the good coffee <p> I will ALWAYS , without exception , google best coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the reviews and ensure that were talking high quality , third wave , coffee snob-approved coffee joints and add them to my notes . In recent travels , I 've started a new tradition of coffee crawling my way through a new place , making a point to sample as much coffee as I can manage . Excessive ? Oh yes . But also necessary for maximum happiness ! <p> Its not even 100% about the coffee , though . I find great enjoyment in sitting in coffee shops , observing how they work , watching the baristas , maybe even listening in on nearby conversations . Cafe culture fascinates me . You 're likely to find more locals hanging out in these sorts of coffee shops than tourists , which only adds to their appeal and my experience . <h> I walk my mother-effin ASS off <p> I 'm not sure if people fully understand the extent to which I walk when I 'm out frolicking .

Besides , I 'd probably end up thinking about it too much while actually out walking around , and that 's no bueno . <p> When I set out for the day , I 'm walking . Taking any form of motorized transport is not even an option in my mind ( unless perhaps where I ended up frolicking was so far away that it required a bus or train ride just to get there , in which case I 'd surely need a ride back ) . I walk past the point of blistering and chafing , the pain numbed by my contentment . I 'm most in my element when I 'm frolicking , and that 's one of the reasons why I primarily travel solo .

When I left that job in 2013 to travel Southeast Asia for 5 months , I felt a huge shift in me . I knew in my heart that I did n't  ever want to be a full time wedding photographer , but I wanted to keep taking photos and sharing my unique views with the world . This travel blog has bridged the gap for me as I 've gradually transitioned out of wedding photography and into travel photography . <p> I started this travel blog as an outlet for my travel photography . I may not have a clue what I 'm doing writing these posts , but I sure know what I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of practicing photography ( the latter half of that being professionally ) , I 've carefully honed my skills with both cameras and editing software and I 'm still learning !

This is more of a what-to than a how-to guide , so feel free to consult Google as needed ! <p> Landscape photography in Canyonlands National Park , Utah . <h> Taking Photos With The Canon 5d Mark III <p> When it comes to taking insanely awesome travel photos : <p> It matters which camera you use . Sure , you might get some lucky snaps with your iPhone , GoPro , or point-and-shoot camera , but they wo n't be as artful as if you had taken those same shots with a professional level SLR camera and lens . Pay for quality and you get quality , it 's that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using your camera . You can have the fanciest camera and lens on the market , but if you do n't know how to use your gear , you wo n't get amazing images . <p> In other words : If you want to improve your travel photography , you should invest as much money as you can in your camera gear and as much time as you can in learning how to use it . I 'm not saying go out and buy the most expensive camera and then try to teach yourself photography that might be a little foolhardy if you are n't already a proficient photographer . Instead , buy a camera appropriate for your skill level and practice your photography ; then once you outgrow it , consider upgrading to a better camera . <h> My Camera Gear For Travel <p> I have a somewhat unconventional setup for travel and carry about 12kg worth of camera gear . It 's heavy , cumbersome , and a complete pain in the arse when it comes to flying but I would n't change a thing about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to bring home the travel images I want . <p> Here 's my camera gear for travel : <p> Canon 5d Mark III &amp; II I kept the Mark II as a backup for shooting weddings when I upgraded to the Mark III , and after my Mark III broke in Thailand I now travel with both cameras . The Canon 5d Mark III is amazing in almost every way in particular , it excels in low light situations ( something the Mark II lacked ) and takes great video . <p> Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L A sturdy wide angle lens that I rely on for epic landscape photos and architectural street shooting . It stays on my camera most of the time . I 'd be utterly lost without this lens in my travel kit ! <p> Canon 50mm f/1.8 A tiny plastic lens that can be had for less than $100 , this is the thing I throw on my camera when I 'm not planning on shooting much but want to have it with me just in case . This is far from the best lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for travel photography , but it 's great value for what it is . I mostly just wanted something at a focal length that my two zoom lenses do n't cover , so a 50mm was ideal . <p> Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS I do n't know anyone else crazy enough to travel with this lens . This beast weighs 3 lbs and is the big white lens that paparazzi and sports photographers use . It 's perfect for shooting out the car window while on roadtrips . It 's also invaluable to me on hikes and treks when I want to shoot wildlife or landscapes that I ca n't get close to . I do n't even think twice about lugging it with me on overnight treks when I 'm already carrying a massive heavy backpack that 's how much I love and depend on it for great travel photos . <p> All of the above , along with accessories , my laptop , and other random bits and bobs , fit quite nicely in my ONA Camps Bay backpack . <h> My Camera Settings For Taking Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will result in amazing travel photos every single time , so you have to experiment and see what works for you . Learn about aperture and shutter speed and how they relate to exposure . Practice like CRAZY , even when ( nay , especially when ) you 're not traveling . <p> My settings and technique vary from image to image , but in general here 's what I do : <p> Use a polarizing filter I keep this on my wide angle lens at all times ( except when indoors ) because a ) . it protects the lens , and b ) . it makes the image more contrasty , brings out the blue in the sky , and cuts down on unwanted glare and reflections . <p> Shoot in manual mode Usually I choose my desired aperture and then set the shutter speed accordingly so that the frame is properly exposed , but occasionally I might set my shutter speed first ( e.g. when shooting the night sky or a waterfall , where movement is more important to capture ) . If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend putting your camera on Av mode ( aperture priority ) rather than auto so that you at least have control over the aperture . <p> Shoot landscapes with aperture f/7.1-f/9.0 When I want everything in focus , I up my aperture to at least 7.1 higher if I 'm shooting with my 70-200mm telephoto lens . <p> Shoot at aperture f/2.8 and lower when I want a blurred background My two zoom lenses only go down to f/2.8 , but my 50mm lens goes to f/1.8 . If I 'm shooting people or want to isolate objects in a scene , my aperture will usually be as low as possible in order to blur out the background . <p> Keep the ISO as low as possible When you have less light to shoot in , you may need to increase your ISO so that the image is n't too dark but be careful because if you set the ISO too high , the image may turn out grainy and noisy . <p> Shoot RAW RAW files are much larger and less processed than JPG files , but they capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more options for editing . If you shoot RAW , you absolutely must process and edit the file and save the final image as a JPG if you want to do anything with it it 's not like an iPhone where you can just shoot and share the image immediately . <p> Shot at f/2.8 , putting me in focus with the background slightly blurred ( but not too much , since its a wide angle lens ) . <h> Culling Photos with Photo Mechanic <p> Anyone else take at least 10 of the same shot when trying to adequately capture a scene ? Man , it 's so painful having to sort through them all afterwards and pick the best one to edit and share , especially when you have a slow computer or photo editing software . <p> That 's why I 'm so thankful that early on in my photography career , I discovered the wonder that is Photo Mechanic . This nifty workflow accelerator ' allows you to open a folder of images and sift through them at lightning speed . I have literally saved WEEKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slow-loading Lightroom or Photoshop . <p> My process for culling photos with Photo Mechanic looks like this : <p> Open folder of RAW images ( each date gets a separate folder ) . <p> Browse images and mark any keepers as 1 's ( pink ) . <p> Mark any images I REALLY like as 2 's ( red ) or love as 3 's ( orange ) I 'll later pull from these when I want to share a few on social media or add to my portfolio . <p> Filter by Color Class , then highlight and drag the 1 's , 2 's , and 3 's ( pinks , reds , oranges ) separately into Lightroom to be imported for editing . The file ratings do n't carry over from Photo Mechanic to Lightroom , so I re-star the images once they 're in Lightroom . <p> After this quick and painless culling process , I 'm left with only the best images to edit in Lightroom far less overwhelming ! <h> Editing Photos With Lightroom <p> Just like there 's no one recipe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe to follow when editing photos . Both require copious practice and experimentation ! My editing software of choice is Lightroom because its simpler and has a better workflow than Photoshop , but either will do the trick . <h> My Lightroom Settings <p> It took me a long-ass time to come up with an image editing style that really worked for me . I recommend downloading Lightroom presets from VSCO ( yes , the same VSCO you might use to edit your instagram photos ) and playing around with them . You should definitely tweak the presets and not just use them at face value ( else it looks kind of obvious you used a preset , you know ? ) then save it as a new preset , which you can apply to all images upon importing into Lightroom . <p> VSCO presets tend to give digital images a more film-like look , but they do n't necessarily work well on every travel image . I started with a Fuji Astia preset from the VSCO Film 04 Canon set and heavily tweaked it to make it my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the highlights down super low ( around -85 ) , clarity high ( around 25-30 ) , and whites high ( around 50 ) , all set under the Basic section . The VSCO presets also tend to adjust the saturation/luminance of individual colors , which is under the HSL / Color / B&amp;W section . If I want darker skies , I 'll lower the luminance of blues here . <h> Categorizing/Rating Images in Lightroom <p> One big reason I use Lightroom instead of Photoshop is that it 's far more handy in terms of workflow . Not only can you edit images , you can also categorize them in several ways . After all what good is having thousands upon thousands of gorgeous travel photos if you can never find them after the fact ? Lightroom 's many categorization tools help keep everything organized and searchable . <p> Here 's what I do to keep my images organized in Lightroom : <p> Tags If there are any tags that apply to ALL images imported from Photo Mechanic into Lightroom , I will add them before importing ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the whole batch ) . Once the images are in Lightroom , I will go in and add additional tags as needed . Tags are SO important because they allow you to easily search your image archives . An added bonus for me is that these tags carry over when I upload photos to Flickr , which is where I save backups of all my photos . <p> Stars All my images should be starred already from when I imported them from Photo Mechanic , but as I go through and edit I may adjust their rating . 2 = really like ; 3 and above = LOVE . <p> Flags When deciding which images are to be shared on social media , I filter to only show those rated 2 stars and above . The ones I select are then marked with a flag . <p> Colors When exporting images to be used in a blog post , I 'll mark them all the same color . If any images in this folder are already marked a certain color ( from another blog post ) , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online <p> I am perpetually behind in sharing my travel photos with the world ( because my editing backlog averages about 2 months ) , but here 's what I do with my final travel images : <p> Upload ( almost ) all photos to Flickr With an absurdly large amount of storage space , I use Flickr as a backup for all my high res images . I have a meticulous organizational system where all my photos are tagged appropriately and added to a relevant folder on my Flickr account . That way , it 's super easy for me to search for photos from past trips when I want to use them in retroactive blog posts or share them with people . <p> Include some photos in blog posts For each blog post I write , I open Lightroom and select the images I want to include , mark them all with the same color ( so I know that I 've already used that photo on the blog ) , and export them to the blog using the LR/Blog plugin . <p> Share the best photos on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked 2 stars or above , flag the ones I want to share on social media , and export low res versions to a separate folder . These will eventually get shared on Facebook ; a few will supplement my iPhone images on Instagram . <h> How do you work on your travel photography ? Any time-saving or quality-enhancing tips to add ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> This is wonderful Lins ! Thank you I am always constantly working to improve my travel photography . When I travel I generally tend to avoid buying souvenirs , my pictures are my memories so I always aim to make them the best I can . I still have not become accustomed to using Lightroom or shooting in RAW ( although I have been taught both several years ago ) ; PS still feels more natural to me 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> YES , exactly ! Memories as souvenirs , made tangible through photos I like that ! : ) Lightroom is super intuitive , I think you 'd be able to catch on quickly if you just started playing around with it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the pains of finding a great editing process .

Now , if only I could start using that starring system 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> You 're so welcome ! : D Even the process of figuring out Lightroom and setting up presets can be time consuming , but once you have them down , everything else speeds up drastically . Definitely worth the effort and time to learn ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792929 @7792929/ <h> A Carefree Jaunt Through Arches National Park <p> I feel like there 's a lot of pressure in visiting Arches National Park . It 's seemingly not enough just to go and take skillfully-composed pictures of the arches no , you 've got to go to the right arches at the right time . You must plan your trip between mid-March and mid-April and catch Delicate Arch at sunset , amidst a hoard of other people , when the sunset angle is juuuuust right . Then you need to return to the park in the dead of night , set up your tripod , and take a crazy-long exposure of some other arch backed by the milky way . <p> Five years ago , I would have been alllllll over this . I 'd have felt obligated to come back from this trip with a killer shot of an arch at sunrise or sunset and immediately post that ish all over Flickr . But now ? I 'm just not about it . <p> These days , I value the overall travel experience more than the photos I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did Arches National Park <p> I went canyoneering in the morning , spent lunchtime basking in the sun at my campsite on the Colorado River , then moseyed on over to Arches after 1:00 . I had no schedule to keep to , no specific locations to hit it was just me , blasting the Glee soundtrack as I drove carefree through the park , pulling over whenever I felt like checking out an arch . It was exactly what I wanted . <p> One of the earlier stops along the road is Park Avenue , a valley lined with skyscraper-esque red rock pillars . Every resource I read recommended doing this hour-long hike later in the day , but it was 2:30 , the sun felt damn good on my pasty skin , and I just could n't help myself from hopping out of the car for a little jaunt through nature . <p> BEST DECISION . I skipped along in my flip flops , taking in the bright red rock around me . There 's something to be said for the vibrant colors yielded during midday sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I prefer it to the subtle golden glow emitted just before sunset . I practically had the whole valley to myself and it was GLORIOUS . <p> Honestly , I 'd have been perfectly content with just doing Park Ave and driving around , but I figured I should check out an arch or two while I was there . I popped over to the Windows section of the park which , while not overrun with tourists , was still poppin ' with visitors climbing the arches . I joined them , sitting on the edge of the North Window for a bit just taking in the view . Above , this massive arch curving over my head ; below , massive rocks just down the ravine . Being surrounded by such majestic feats of nature really puts life into perspective we 're all so small in the grand scheme of things . <p> South Window 's impressive too , but harder to climb up into especially with a sprained toe . Pass ! <p> South Window ( left ) , North Window ( right ) from behind <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snatch away the golden hour light . I caught a glimmer of it while driving to the next set of arches , but it was quickly overcome by an overcast sky . <p> I wound up by Delicate Arch , aka the most-photographed arch in all of the park ( you know , the one on the Utah license plate ? ) , for sunset . There 's a lengthy hike you can do that will take you uphill right to the arch , but if you 're there for sunset you 'll end up walking back in the dark . I opted to take a shorter trail to a lookout point below the arch . It looks SO TINY from below certainly not the 65 foot height its in the books for . <p> Arches National Park is beautiful at all times of day , no schedule needed ! 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792930 @7792930/ <h> Montreal Street Art : Its EVERYWHERE ! <p> First , let 's clarify what is meant by street art : In my mind , street art is done with the intent of bringing art to a community . By contrast , graffiti tagging is destructive and self-serving . Bueno vs. no bueno , in other words . <p> Street art and graffiti are largely considered illegal , but some cities have embraced it as an art form and offer permits to street artists , making it legal in some parts . New York , Berlin , and Melbourne come to mind as cities where street art is *a thing* little did I know that Montreal would also earn a spot on this list ! Being able to walk around a city , feeling like you 're making your way through an outdoor museum of sorts , makes me immensely happy and that 's why I adore street art . <p> Check out some of the street art I encountered while exploring Montreals " outdoor museum " : <h> Graffiti tagging <p> Like any major city , you 'll see tagging in Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here ! " self-serving mark to make , as compared to street artists who make their art for the benefit of others to enjoy . <p> I was pleased to see a much higher concentration of street art than graffiti tagging in Montreal , though it makes my skin crawl just a bit whenever I see beautiful street art marked up by some ugly tags . <h> Street art on apartment buildings <p> The prevalence of street art in Montreal was most evident to me when I started noticing colorful apartment complexes around town . I could n't believe that some apartments had whole sides completely painted over with vibrant murals . As street art friendly as NYC is , I 've never seen it on private residences before . If I were ever to move to Montreal , I 'd 100% want to live in one of these . <h> Street art in parking lots <p> Even some parking lots in Montreal are decorated with street art . No big deal , let me just pull my car up to this face right here <h> Murals on storefronts <p> What most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storefronts in The Plateau neighborhood . Unbeknownst to me , the Mural Festival had taken place earlier in the summer ( June 2013 ) , where some 35 international artists brought their art to Boulevard St-Laurent and surrounds and colored the neighborhood with murals . I 'm not exaggerating when I say that you literally can not walk down this street without street art in your line of sight . IT IS GLORIOUS ! <h> Street art EVERYWHERE <p> My favorite kind of street art ? The really random pieces , often in really random spots . The ones I like tend to look like stickers or decals stuck onto walls and fences . Google tells me this form of street art is wheatpasting : gluing posters , drawings , etc to the street with a ( wheat ) paste . My favorites are usually of people with weird facial expressions : even better if they have mismatched heads and bodies .

@@118792931 @7792931/ <h> Kayaking The Caves and Islands of Phang Nga Bay , Thailand <p> My impetuous trip to Thailand in June- was all about the diving . So naturally , the- initial plan was to fly- from Sydney to Phuket and head straight to Koh Tao for the entire 10 days. - Then I thought , hmm : should I maybe spend a little time in Phuket while I 'm there ? What even is there to do there , anyway ? <p> Turns out , not much during the wet season , aka when I was in town . Phuket and the Andaman islands are really not ideal places to be in Thailand during monsoon season unless you 're cool with heavy rain every day . I do n't  know about you , but this sun seeker certainly is n't ! <p> Thankfully Koh Tao and the other Gulf islands are mostly lovely during the wet season . And as it turns out , so is Phang Nga Bay ! Located- just northeast of Phuket , its technically part of the Andaman Sea but tends to be sheltered from the monsoonal winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing to do here is take a boat trip around the beautifully scenic limestone karsts . <p> There 's a staggering array of tours that operate in the bay . They may- let you off on different islands to swim or snorkel , take you to local villages , or head straight to the uber-popular James Bond Island . The vessel might be a speed boat , slow boat , or junk. - And naturally , the tours all vary on start time and duration . With such a ridiculous number of permutations here , you will definitely find a Phang Nga Bay tour that suits you . <p> As for me , I was n't sure exactly what I wanted aside from avoiding the crowds as much as possible . Then I saw the 1600+ 5-star reviews for John Grays Sea Canoe and kinda felt like someone was shoving- a big fat DUH sign in my face . <p> With that , I booked their Hong by Starlight day trip from Phuket . You guys , the mass amount of- TripAdvisor reviews do n't  lie : this Phang Nga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever done on my travels . And Ive done a LOT of pretty rad things around the world , so know that this is n't hyperbole . <h> Touring- Phang Nga Bay with John Grays Sea Canoe <p> Okay , first a note on the name : What the actual f*** is a sea canoe , amiright ? - This tour utilizes inflatable kayaks to explore some caves , - definitely not canoes in any form . In fact , I 'm pretty sure there 's no such thing as a " sea canoe " , and that John Gray cleverly used the faux-term in his business name to stand out from the crowd. - But more on the- kayaking later . <p> Now , onto the tour ! <p> The Hong by Starlight tour starts late to avoid the crowds , and returns late after a very long day at sea . I got picked up just before noon at my hotel in Patong , where it was pouring rain , - and dropped off about an hour later at the Ao Po pier on Phang Nga Bay , where thankfully it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convene for check-in at a little shop by the pier where you can buy snacks and dry bags , but do n't  waste your money because you 're very well fed on board and there are large- dry bags on the boat which- you 're encouraged to borrow . <p> From here , we boarded our big slow boat and headed out into the bay. - I know I 'm all about the active , outdoorsy stuff , but honestly : there 's nothing I love more than sunbathing on a boat in a tropical locale . I 'd have been pretty dang happy touring Phang Nga Bay- on a sailboat and alternating between gazing out at the plentiful limestone karsts and dozing off in the sun . So- I have to admit I was pretty ambivalent about the whole cave kayaking thing . <p> Early on in the trip , they paired us up with a local guide so that it was two people per guide/kayak ( or two parents and one small child per guide ) . This solo traveler got a guide all to herself , though ! <p> You know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually shaped like doughnuts and at low tide , you can paddle through them and into the lagoon in the center . The " hong " , if you will ( that 's Thai for " room " ) . <p> I did initially wonder why it was that we had to be paddled through the caves by a guide , rather than paddle ourselves . I mean , how unfit did they expect their customers to be ? Surely most of us can handle a quick paddle . <p> Little did I know how harrowing- these cave entrances would be ! No way in hell could or should the average person attempt to pass through without guidance from someone who 's done it many times before . You have to know exactly where to enter and exit , lest you get lost- in the maze ; and you must skillfully deflate the kayak- at certain points so that you can safely pass through without getting stuck . <p> The photos below should help illustrate my point . It gets much tighter further on , to the point where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back- in pitch dark , look straight up at the rock and pray to god that my face would n't get sliced off . Hello adrenaline rush ! <p> During one of our kayaking sessions , they gave us the option of paddling ourselves around without a guide so , you know , it was n't a completely lazy day on the bay . Unless of course you took this time to paddle no more than 10 strokes away from the big boat to optimally place yourself for a selfie , then paddle straight back . *ahem* <p> We wrapped up our kayaking for the day and returned to the boat for THE MOST FABULOUS THAI FEAST IN ALL THE LAND. - It may have been the best Thai food I 've had in my life , and I totally regret not gorging on it ( I think I must have gotten distracted by the view or something ) . <p> Then we paired up with our guides and helped them build a " kratong " out of flowers and banana leaves . The Thai typically release these vessels down a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the purposes of this tour , we 'd paddle out once more on the kayaks and release the kratongs into the bay after dark . <p> My guide crafted 2 birds out of flowers : he said the lower one was me holding my camera ! ( with the big zoom lens ) <p> Despite the relatively cloudy day we were dealt with , the sunset that evening was absolutely spectacular . I 'm glad we got to fully enjoy it before hopping back into the kayaks one last time at dusk . <p> We paddled into a cave nearby to check out the phosphorescent plankton that you can see glowing under the water once its dark . I loved doing this in Maya Bay and at Koh Rong during my big Asia trip in 2013 , but it was a lot less thrilling from a kayak and under a time constraint . Plus , they 're best seen in complete darkness , which we did n't  quite have at dusk . <p> Then- we lit the candles and incense in our kratongs and let them out into the water . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird that I had to grab my kratong after a few minutes , blow out the flames , and take it back onto the kayak . It lost a bit of the magic there , I felt . I 'm very on board with the eco-friendliness , but I do n't  know , maybe they could have had someone paddle out to the cave to collect the kratongs afterwards ? <p> Rushed ending to the day aside , I love-love-LOVED my Phang Nga Bay tour . And true to their claim , we did avoid the tourist crowds . I got extra-lucky with a guide that liked to be the first into all the caves it felt like I had it all to myself for the first minute or so before the rest of the kayaks followed us in . <p> Unless you 're clastrophobic or have zero desire to kayak , John Grays Sea Canoe Hong By Starlight tour is the way to go ! Seriously 1600+ rave reviews on TripAdvisor ca n't be wrong . Worth every baht and more , I say . 205739 @qwx1065739 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx1065747

@@118792942 @7792942/ <h> Montreal Street Art : Its EVERYWHERE ! <p> First , let 's clarify what is meant by street art : In my mind , street art is done with the intent of bringing art to a community . By contrast , graffiti tagging is destructive and self-serving . Bueno vs. no bueno , in other words . <p> Street art and graffiti are largely considered illegal , but some cities have embraced it as an art form and offer permits to street artists , making it legal in some parts . New York , Berlin , and Melbourne come to mind as cities where street art is *a thing* little did I know that Montreal would also earn a spot on this list ! Being able to walk around a city , feeling like you 're making your way through an outdoor museum of sorts , makes me immensely happy and that 's why I adore street art . <p> Check out some of the street art I encountered while exploring Montreals " outdoor museum " : <h> Graffiti tagging <p> Like any major city , you 'll see tagging in Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here !

I could n't believe that some apartments had whole sides completely painted over with vibrant murals . As street art friendly as NYC is , I 've never seen it on private residences before . If I were ever to move to Montreal , I 'd 100% want to live in one of these . <h> Street art in parking lots <p> Even some parking lots in Montreal are decorated with street art . No big deal , let me just pull my car up to this face right here <h> Murals on storefronts <p> What most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storefronts in The Plateau neighborhood . Unbeknownst to me , the Mural Festival had taken place earlier in the summer ( June 2013 ) , where some 35 international artists brought their art to Boulevard St-Laurent and surrounds and colored the neighborhood with murals . I 'm not exaggerating when I say that you literally can not walk down this street without street art in your line of sight . IT IS GLORIOUS ! <h> Street art EVERYWHERE <p> My favorite kind of street art ? The really random pieces , often in really random spots . The ones I like tend to look like stickers or decals stuck onto walls and fences . Google tells me this form of street art is wheatpasting : gluing posters , drawings , etc to the street with a ( wheat ) paste .

( Which is pretty much the purpose this blog post is serving ) <p> And on the other , more selfish hand , I want it to remain Victoria 's best kept secret . Something is always at least a teensy bit more special just because not many other people know about it , ya know ? The Peninsula is largely comprised of locals , and I shudder to think about what this place would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as a travel blogger , it 's my duty to share all sorts of cool travel finds and it 's my passion to inspire you to seek out these awesome adventures yourself . So of course I 'm going to spill . <p> The Mornington Peninsula Coastal Track . <p> The Mornington Peninsula is the best of Victoria in one region . While the Great Ocean Road is famed for its glorious rugged coast and the Yarra Valley for its phenomenal wine , Mornington damn near matches them both while doing a whole lot of other things exceptionally well , too . It 's a place where you can be within a few minutes from both an ocean beach and a bay beach , spend an entire day hiking along the coast or wine tasting in the countryside , and end up at the local hot springs to end the day . <p> What 's more : because it 's a peninsula , you 're always a quick drive away from some other point of interest , which means you spend less time driving and more time adventuring ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend getaway , or visiting Melbourne and have time to make just one side trip nearby , the Mornington Peninsula will give you the optimum bang for your buck . <p> Here are the things I believe make the Mornington Peninsula the best side trip from Melbourne . <h> Wineries With a View <p> The Yarra Valley gets all the glory as Victoria 's prized wine region , but there are some seriously stellar wineries out of the Mornington Peninsula , too . Victoria and Tasmania specialize in cool climate wines like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay , and the Peninsula wineries do them good justice . Most of them are located in or near Red Hill , making for breezy vineyard hopping by car or bike . <p> Port Phillip Estate is a little bit fancy pants . The venue is modern and gorgeous , with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the vineyards and providing a slight view of the sea . We were dressed pretty casually and walked in with backpacks , which might have been off-putting to one of the servers who basically walked away from us mid-tasting . Kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tipsy spirits ! <p> Red Hill Estate has absolutely insane views of the vineyards rolling down to the sea . I 've never visited a cellar door with such a stunning landscape in its backyard . Combine a casual tasting with lunch at an outdoor table and you 've got yourself a killer afternoon on the Peninsula . <h> Dramatic Coastline With Ocean Beaches <p> If you 're dead-set on hitting the Great Ocean Road , by all means : make that long , winding drive down and back and hit beach after rock formation after scenic overlook . I would never tell you not to make this epic Great Ocean Road Trip because it is truly stellar , but you 're in for a whole lot of driving if you do . <p> Coastal views to Bushrangers Bay . <p> Alternatively , if you prefer your rugged coastal views with a side of other awesome stuff and a little less time behind the wheel , the Mornington Peninsula might be more your style . The south/western coasts face the ocean and are littered with sand dunes , cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular at these back beaches , but you could also opt to walk the Mornington Peninsula coastal track ( see Coastal Hikes below ) , go paragliding , jump off some boulders , or take a dip in the rock pools at low tide . <p> Point Nepean . <p> London Bridge . <p> Sorrento rock pools . <h> Stunning Bay Beaches <p> If surf beaches are n't your jam , the Peninsula 's got you covered with plenty of calmer beaches along Port Phillip Bay . These beaches are better fit for swimming , boating , sailing , kayaking , and paddleboarding . And man , are they stunning on a sunny day do n't those colors look like something off of a tropical island ? <p> View from Arthurs Seat . <p> Ritzy Portsea . <p> One thing tourists are usually super keen to see on their visit to Melbourne is the famous Brighton Beach bathing boxes .

This is more of a bush walk , as it runs inland from coast to coast and provides the best opportunity to spot native animals in the wild . There 's said to be fabulous sea views from the higher vantage points along the trail . <p> Bushrangers Bay Walk A short 5km walk between Cape Schanck and Flinders with great coastal views and a bit of bush walking . <p> Mornington Peninsula Coastal Track Covers the 26km coastline from Cape Schanck up to London Bridge in Portsea . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just off many of the ocean beaches . <p> Point Nepean Walk Runs down a paved road to the very tip of the peninsula . Stellar views of the bay , sea , and nearby forts and coves . Try to do this one on a clear day if you want to see that bright blue-colored water . <p> Bay Trail Runs along the bay beaches from Portsea to Dromana . This is more of a stroll than anything , as you can easily break away to roam around the villages or grab a bite . <p> Beyond these , there are many more shorter walks you can do around the Peninsula this website outlines several walking options . <p> If you 're going to do any walking or hiking at all , my best advice is to walk along the coast , either north or east of Cape Schanck . The Mornington Peninsula Coastal Track is super stunning ! <p> Bay of Islands , on the Mornington Peninsula Coastal Track . <h> Classic Australian Wildlife <p> I would n't go as far as to recommend the Mornington Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of those uniquely-Australian critters is on your to-do list , you should still be able to check it off if this is your one side trip from Melbourne . I 've spotted an echidna up by Arthur 's Seat , an area which is known to be oft frequented by kangaroos . Though I did n't catch any roos there , I did see several down on the south coast of the peninsula , just east of Cape Schanck on the coastal path to Bushrangers Bay . <h> What do you think ? Would you make a side trip to the Peninsula on your Melbourne or Australia travels ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of March 2016 The Mornington Peninsula is a quick 1.5 hour drive south from Melbourne .

While it may not be the best option for taking a long , leisurely , aimless bike ride , for me it ended up being far more affordable ( even with the overtime fees ) than renting a regular bike for the day . And it was nice not having to worry about the bike when I was walking around once I returned it to the dock , it was no longer my responsibility .

Man , if I could bottle up this view and replay it on loop back home , I would . <p> And at low tide , it gets even better ! The tide goes way out , allowing you to frolic far out on the smooth wet sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for a swim , as you 'll have to go quite far out for deeper water . <h> Paradise Lost &amp; Sunset Beach <p> I stayed at Paradise Lost , the lone budget resort on Koh Kradan located 5 minutes inland ( Note : you 'll see a sign for it just to the right when you get off the ferry or snorkel boat just follow that path into the woods ) . Picture a grassy patch surrounded by jungle , containing a handful of the most basic bungalows imaginable and a couple of ramshackle huts for dining . It 's not exactly a place you 'd want to hang out at during the day , but its restaurant supposedly serves up the best food on the island . Everything I had was great , and the portion sizes were HUGE . I had on omelet the size of a small pizza , and a bowl of curry so big that I could n't even finish it ! ( and I ALWAYS clear my plate at meals , so that 's saying something ! ) <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 minutes , you 'll reach Sunset Beach . It 's very rocky with rough surf definitely not meant for swimming , but ideal for catching the sunset . The sunset was a wash both nights I was on the island , yet somehow my camera managed to work its magic and capture the sky like this : <h> Snorkelling at Koh Kradan <p> I 'm very skeptical of snorkeling trips the idea of being herded from island to island with 20 other people , many of whom will stand on the reef and/or furiously kick at the surface and scare away the fish just does not appeal . But the snorkel boat I caught back to Koh Lanta made a quick stop at the reef on the other side of Koh Kradan before heading to Koh Lanta , so I felt obliged to see how Koh Kradan 's snorkeling stacked up . It was actually pretty good out there ! Definitely no competition for the Great Barrier Reef , but so far it 's the best reef I 've seen outside of Australia . 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I 'd be perfectly happy to chase summer for the rest of my life . <p> But lately Ive been lusting after Lapland and the arctic region . They seem so exotic so extreme . The way I see it : if you 're going to do winter , you might as well go big or go home . In this case , " big " = remote , rugged , wildly scenic , and really freaking cold i.e. all the qualities that really define this region . <p> I do n't  share a Wanderlust Wednesday post every week , or even necessarily every month , because you cant really plan your wanderlust . I love for the inspiration to come organically , ideally learning about an enticing new destination through a casual conversation with someone who 's been there . <p> On that note , I recently caught wind of a fascinating place called Svalbard : a Norwegian archipelago situated about halfway between Norway and the North Pole . You really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far north this land is . There 's not much else beyond it before you hit the North Pole ! I can hardly wrap my mind around that or the fact that Oslo , capital of Norway , is closer to Africa than its own archipelago . Or that there are more polar bears than humans on Svalbard . <p> But you know , that does make sense . Svalbards icy landscape provides an ideal setting for all sorts of arctic creatures to thrive , one that most people likely couldnt endure year-round . <p> Unfortunately , Svalbard is not a budget destination . Because of its remoteness , getting there is a bit of an expensive mission . Then once you 've arrived , getting around and taking advantage of all the wintry outdoor adventures will cost you an arm and a few legs and likely a good amount of frustration , which is why most travelers opt to travel with a group rather than independently . <p> Still it might be a travel splurge worth making someday .

But one night , I took a really long walk up to Saddleback Ridge and slept in my sleeping bag on the viewing platform up there . I fell asleep with the Milky Way clear above my head , then woke up around 3am to a completely different star scene . I could n't resist groggily setting up my tripod and capturing it on camera . <h> 3 . Lucky Bay Rainbow <p> I go pretty crazy upon seeing any rainbow , but to see one at the same time I 'm witnessing a crazy-beautiful sunrise on one of the most glorious beaches there ever was ? Well , that was straight-up magical .

@@118792961 @7792961/ <h> Crossing The Border On The New Bangkok-Siem Reap Bus <p> Before I even began planning my 2013 Asia trip , I knew about the infamous scams at the Thailand-Cambodia border . Not only that , but I 'd heard it was one hell of a journey , requiring several different connections , all of which were subject to scams and other discomforts . <p> From my high level understanding , the border crossing process looked something like this : <p> Bus from Bangkok to somewhere close to the border in Thailand . <p> Tuk tuk to the official border . Tuk tuk driver will try to take you to somewhere nearby to pay an inflated price for your visa . SCAM ! <p> Get visa . Cross border . Woohoo ! <p> Free bus to somewhere just over the border in Cambodia . <p> Bus/taxi to Siem Reap . Long , bumpy ride . <p> I 'm all for adventure travel , but this does n't  sound like a fun time at all . I was n't even sure I wanted to go to Cambodia that badly , but since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait about a week to return to Bangkok to pick up my fixed camera , it made the most sense for me to " kill time " there . <p> And with that I was going to Cambodia ! <p> Having made this decision a bit last-minute , I was frantically searching for details the night before on how exactly to go through the Thailand-Cambodia border crossing process . I came across reports of a brand new bus that runs direct from Bangkok to Siem Reap which would greatly simplify the journey . Needless to say , I was SOLD . <p> So how did it go ? And how exactly does the Thailand-Cambodia border crossing work with the new direct Bangkok-Siem Reap bus ? Read on ! <h> Crossing The Thailand-Cambodia Border <h> In Bangkok : <p> Buses depart from the Mo Chit 2 Bus Terminal in northern Bangkok . You could take the MRT to Chatuchak Station , then take either a bus ( #77 ) that will bring you to the terminal , or a tuk tuk/taxi . When I weighed the time/effort required this way vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hostel to the bus terminal , I opted for the 15-minute cab ride , which cost me 110 baht from Lumphini ( +45 baht toll ) just over $5 total . <p> Go inside the ground floor entrance of the terminal and buy your Bangkok-Siem Reap ticket from window #22 . As of April 2013 , there is one bus daily departing at 9am that costs 750 baht . Your ticket should have your seat number and gate number printed on it . If for some reason the bus is full , you could always just buy a ticket to Aranyaprathet and make your own way to Siem Reap via tuk tuk/bus ( these buses depart something like every hour daily ) . <p> The Mo Chit 2 station is easy to navigate and has a few shops and cafes inside so you can grab your last minute snacks from 7-11 and coffee from Dunkin Donuts ! <p> Speaking of snacks , they actually served us food on the bus ! Shortly after boarding , we were each given a box which contained a small cookie and packets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make coffee , so I 'm not sure what the coffee packs were for ) . <h> In Aranyaprathet : <p> We arrived in Aranyaprathet around 1pm ( 4 hours from Bangkok ) and stopped briefly to drop off/pick up a few passengers . <p> They served us a small lunch on the bus ( fried rice and vegetables ) and then drove us to an office across the street where they told us we had to get a Cambodian visa if we did n't already have one . <p> DO N'T LISTEN TO THEM THEY ARE SCAMMING YOU ! <p> I 'd done enough research beforehand that I knew this was coming . Just to be sure , I asked if I could pay in USD at the border . The officer told me that this WAS the border , and that the visa would cost 1000 baht ( $35 ) . I told him that this was NOT the border , and that I would pay $20 instead to get the visa at the official border , and walked out before he could even respond . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else got scammed . I held tight for the bus to take us to the border , which was just a few minutes down the road . <h> At The Border ( Poipet ) : <p> First you 'll enter the Departures building where you 'll officially exit Thailand . Fill out the departure card you were given when you first entered Thailand ( they also provide them here in case you do n't have one ) . Get your passport stamped , then proceed outside toward arrivals . <p> Just to the right of the Kingdom of Cambodia gate is the visa office . Fill out a visa form and hand over your passport with a passport-sized photo , and 5-10 minutes later your visa should be ready . It should cost $20 + 100 baht ( $3 ) . I 've no idea what the extra 100 baht is for , but I could n't find a way to avoid it . <p> Once you have your Cambodian visa , head through the Cambodia gate and to the Arrivals building . They will stamp your passport and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ! <p> Note : Even though the rest of the bus passengers had gotten in line at the Arrivals building before I did ( since I had to stop to get my visa first ) , they were n't too far ahead of me in line . The driver saw me in line and knew to wait for me before continuing the drive into Cambodia , so no worries about missing the bus ! <h> In Siem Reap : <p> We left the border at 2:45pm and arrived in Siem Reap at 5pm . Aside from the driver making a few quick stops to check out some religious statues for sale on the side of the road , the ride was pretty smooth . Before improvements were made to the road , this segment of the trip used to take 6+ hours ! <p> In Siem Reap , there were tuk tuks ready to take us to our hotels as soon as we stepped off the bus . The driver made it sound like he had handpicked these trusted tuk tuk drivers and encouraged us to use them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my accommodation for $1 I hardly even minded when he tried to sell me on his all-day tour of the temples because he was just so sweet . <h> Would I recommend the new direct Bangkok-Siem Reap bus ? <p> YES . It was super comfortable , the bathroom was decent , the ride was smooth , and above all it cut out all the moving parts the traditional border crossing entails . This one bus takes you all the way from Bangkok to Siem Reap , making for a relatively stress-free ride . <p> The only caveat here is the scam at the border . As long as you go into it knowing that they 're going to try to get everyone on the bus to pay nearly double the price to get their visas just before getting to the border , you can plan to opt out of this and pay the actual fee of $20 at the official border instead . It was a minor annoyance , but not enough to offset the convenience and ease of taking this direct bus . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame though that they still try to pull this visa scam on tourists . Hopefully as many people as possible will read blogs like yours before planning their trip ! : ) <p> cdude <p> Another part of that scam is that they will convince you that its best to convert your currency at the border . So , then you 're brought a special " bank " -for the sake of convenience . Scam is you get around 30% less than one would yield from a reputable bank . And . they fail to tell you that the USD is actually the preferred currency in Siem Reap ( and most of Cambodia ) . 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> YES , very true !

On the other hand , I did n't  get my hands on a bike til 3 weeks in but once I did , my happiness level instantly multiplied and the world felt right again . <p> Regardless of priority , Melbourne is a city of neighborhoods . To know , appreciate , and truly experience this city , you really need to get to know its hoods .

I was feeling utterly overwhelmed by all that I had n't  managed to see until I hopped on a bike from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to with my rad two-wheeler : <h> Cycling the Capital City Trail <p> By recommendation of The Humble Vintage , I set out to tackle the Capital City Trail , 12 glorious kilometers right along the Yarra River from the CBD to Abbotsford . With the exception of a few road crossings , the entire route is free of traffic . I cycled through woods , crossed lots of bridges , and even passed by a farm while on the trail . Much of the time it did n't  even feel like I was in Melbourne , then I 'd pass some street art and be reminded of my urban location . <p> I ended up at the Abbotsford Convent , which now hosts a few cafes and galleries .

Cyclists are actually respected and encouraged to ride on the roads here , unlike in New York City where drivers typically cuss at you and cut you off to make turns .

Its safe to say I was very much in my element as we cruised down the river . <p> I had a blast and a half chilling out on the top deck , listening to the crews entertaining commentary , and bridge-watching . A boat trip is the perfect way to spend a sunny day in London ! <h> Westminster Bridge <p> Technically we did n't  pass under Westminster Bridge , but we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier just east , where our trip began . Big Ben and the House of Parliament is one of those iconic views that just never gets old . <p> You know what else never gets old ? Seeing the London Eye . The London skyline would be remarkably different without it there . Somehow , after 2 visits to this city Ive yet to take a ride on it , mainly because its a rough -26.25 ( $43 US ) even more if you do n't  buy your ticket in advance . Woof . <h> Hungerford Bridge <p> I think the Hungerford Bridge is in the running for my favorite bridge in London . It reminds me of the similarly cable-stayed Anzac Bridge in Sydney . What 's more , it looks different from every angle , making it super fun to pass beneath . <h> Waterloo Bridge <p> The Waterloo Bridge definitely is n't the flashiest of Londons bridges , but its ideally located and frames some of the citys landmarks quite nicely . <p> Occasionally I got distracted from bridge-ogling by cool-looking buildings like this one : <h> Blackfriars Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been distracted when we passed by Blackfriars Bridge because I have zero photos of it . I 'm especially bummed because its a colorful bridge , not to mention mystified as to how this oversight could have happened . But for completions sake , I 'll borrow someone elses photo of this pretty bridge : <h> Millennium Bridge <p> I spent a lot of time photographing this beautiful pedestrian bridge my first trip to London , so it was very satisfying to see it from below this time around . I love how Millennium Bridge seems to lead straight to St. Pauls Cathedral , even though it actually does n't  . <p> On our way back the tide had gone out significantly , revealing much of the riverbank . Our cruise crew informed us that trash is removed from the city of London via tugboats pulling barges down the river and out to a waste facility in town called Belvedere . They must be mindful of the tide times : at its lowest , the river is just 1m deep in certain spots ! <h> Southwark Bridge <p> Southwark ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's about all I have to say about it . <h> London Bridge <p> Despite being the most popular bridge in London , London Bridge is quite underwhelming . That 's due to the fact that its only the most recent version of it , following several past London Bridges that have since been replaced . These older medieval bridges were far more exciting than the London Bridge of today . <p> Fun Fact : One prior version of London Bridge was taken apart , shipped overseas to the US , and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . <h> Tower Bridge <p> Behold , the stunner of the Thames : Tower Bridge . Now THIS is the bridge you picture when you think of London . Its two towers , draw bridge , and shades of blue are what make it the winner of my own Best Bridge in London award . <p> Tower Bridge takes its name from the nearby Tower of London , visible as our boat passed beneath the bridge .

It served as my hub during my first London visit in 2008 , but I never made it back there this second time around . There are actually some really cool-looking riverfront buildings in that area who knew ? <p> The remainder of the cruise to Greenwich is unfortunately bridge-less , but after passing by 8 bridges I definitely had my fill . I cant recommend enough a cruise along the Thames , especially on a gorgeous summer day ! <h> Which of Londons bridges is your favorite ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of July 2013 You can book a boat trip down the Thames with City Cruises they offer single and return trips from Westminster to Greenwich and a few stops in-between .

I fell asleep with the Milky Way clear above my head , then woke up around 3am to a completely different star scene .

I 'd be perfectly happy to chase summer for the rest of my life . <p> But lately Ive been lusting after Lapland and the arctic region . They seem so exotic so extreme . The way I see it : if you 're going to do winter , you might as well go big or go home . In this case , " big " = remote , rugged , wildly scenic , and really freaking cold i.e. all the qualities that really define this region . <p> I do n't  share a Wanderlust Wednesday post every week , or even necessarily every month , because you cant really plan your wanderlust . I love for the inspiration to come organically , ideally learning about an enticing new destination through a casual conversation with someone who 's been there . <p> On that note , I recently caught wind of a fascinating place called Svalbard : a Norwegian archipelago situated about halfway between Norway and the North Pole . You really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far north this land is . There 's not much else beyond it before you hit the North Pole ! I can hardly wrap my mind around that or the fact that Oslo , capital of Norway , is closer to Africa than its own archipelago .

Svalbards icy landscape provides an ideal setting for all sorts of arctic creatures to thrive , one that most people likely couldnt endure year-round . <p> Unfortunately , Svalbard is not a budget destination . Because of its remoteness , getting there is a bit of an expensive mission . Then once you 've arrived , getting around and taking advantage of all the wintry outdoor adventures will cost you an arm and a few legs and likely a good amount of frustration , which is why most travelers opt to travel with a group rather than independently . <p> Still it might be a travel splurge worth making someday .

Cheese comprised at least half of the volume of pizza I consumed , which is absolutely disgusting if you think about it for more than a few seconds . <p> Also , COFFEE . I did n't  get to delve too deep into Chicagos coffee scene thanks to the proliferation of Intelligentsia there . Between having a cafe within 5 minutes of the hostel I stayed at and having a specially-roasted blend of Intelligentsia beans at the B&amp;B that hosted us for BlogHouse , I basically drank nothing but Intelligentsia coffee in Chicago .

@@118792982 @7792982/ <p> This year , I turned 31 in Melbourne and used it as an opportunity to cross a bunch of items of my Melbs to-do list . Here 's a run down of the various birthday adventures I crafted for myself in celebration of 31 years on this fine earth : <h> Brunch at The Kettle Black <p> I 'm a self-proclaimed non-foodie ( aka I 'm the worst ) , but if I 'm going out to eat I vastly prefer grabbing brunch 1 ) . Because breakfast foods are the bomb diggity , and 2 ) . PANCAKES . You know how I feel about pancakes . Though I 'm often let down when I order pancakes in different countries because many do n't like to cook them fluffy , a la Americana . <p> I was n't sure what to expect when I ordered the famous Hotcake at The Kettle Black , but certainly not a fluffy pancake bigger than my face . And prettier too , my god ! It was almost too beautiful to dig into . With a light drizzling of maple syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cream , and sprinkling of flower petals atop the hotcake , it was equal parts beautiful and scrumptious . I 'm still not over it . <p> Street art outside of St. Ali <h> Coffee at St. Ali <p> They say St. Ali is an institution in Melbourne , i.e. one of the oldest coffee roasters and most renowned cafes in the city . My frolicking has very rarely taken me to South Melbourne , but since I was already in the hood for brunch I figured I might as well stop by and see what the fuss is about . <p> OH MY SWEET COFFEE LOVING JESUS I need to get back here stat ! It 's such a beautiful space : wooden everything , high ceilings , a myriad of seating options . And it was easily one of the best cups of coffee I 've enjoyed in Melbourne , which unfortunately I had to enjoy in a takeaway cup while en route to my next birthday adventure . I 'm definitely planning to return with my laptop and a little working session in the very near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd snagged a Groupon for a cheap stand-up paddleboarding session and admission to the Brighton Baths and , with glorious 89F sunny weather forecasted , figured it would make for an excellent birthday activity . <p> It totally was . I was a bit of a chicken sh*t and mostly stayed on my knees or bum the whole time , but it was still a good workout trying to stabilize myself on the board while battling light winds . I paddled around the inside of the baths and soaked up the partial views of the Melbourne skyline from through the docks . Had I not la-de-da 'd my way through the morning , I could have made it before the 2pm cutoff and gotten to paddle around outside of the baths oops ! <p> My ticket gave me free entrance to the sauna , but instead I opted to walk around the docks , lay down on one , and get my savsana on in the sun . Equally therapeutic , methinks ! <h> Burger at Grand Trailer Park Taverna <p> My original plan was to try the highly instagrammable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still too sugared out from the pancake to stomach more sweets ( ever since my 10-month paleo stint back in 2012 , I ca n't really handle too much sugar at a time ) . It was about dinner time anyhow , so I gave into the burger craving I 've been having more and more frequently and headed back into the city to cross the insane-looking burgers at Grand Trailer Park Taverna off my list . Part of the experience is the restaurant itself , complete with retro vibes and vintage caravan booths . Their spiked milkshakes are meant to be amazeballs , but my one-track mind led me to ordering just the Atomic burger which had not just a beef patty , but also a cheese kransky ( like a sausage ) , and some seriously delish BBQ sauce and truffle ( ! ! ) mayo . SO GOOD . <h> Bubble Bath in my Backyard <p> In my 5 months of house hopping in Melbourne , I 've seen enough couches on front porches and bathtubs in backyards that it 's almost normal to me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them there just for decoration or gardening purposes . <p> My current house in Brunswick East has a bathtub in the backyard that 's not only clean enough to use as a proper tub , but has also been placed in a dug-out hole in the ground essentially it 's an infinity tub . I saw that on Day 1 and was like , ohhhh yeah that 's happening . And what better time to try it out than on my birthday , right ? <p> Filling the tub was surprisingly easy : I just had to attach the long pool tubing to the laundry room sink and let the other end out into the tub . Then I lit a few candles , poured myself a modest glass of Shiraz , and relaxed to the sound of crickets and bats flying overhead . <p> And then , the icing on the birthday cake : I checked my phone while I was supposed to be relaxing ( I know ) , and found out that I won a photo contest on Instagram that I had n't even realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hashtag ) . My photo of Cape Woolamai won me a glamping experience , a free meal , and complimentary attraction tickets on Phillip Island , which I 'd already booked another trip to for next week anyway . I 'm looking forward to upgrading my upcoming trip there and seeing more of the island ! <h> Do you have any birthday traditions , or plans for this years ?

@@118792984 @7792984/ <h> Lady Elliot Island : Best Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef <p> 93.6% of all tourists in Australia come to see the Great Barrier Reef . <p> Ok I totally made that stat up . Surely there are people who only stop in Sydney or Melbourne on their Aussie trip , or head straight to the Outback to get their bushwalk on . But what is a fact is that over 2 million people each year venture out to explore the Great Barrier Reef and as it 's one of the seven natural wonders of the world as well as the largest reef on the planet , I 'd say the booming tourism is justified . <p> But that 's the thing . When you visit the Great Barrier Reef , you 're contending with thousands of people at a time who are there for the same reason that you are . How do you plan your reef vacation so that it feels less like you 've inadvertently fallen in with a flock of tourists , and more like you 're one of the first to discover this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a study abroad student in Sydney , exploring the Great Barrier Reef was an absolute must-do . I was n't keen on burning most of my school break learning how to dive , so instead I was determined to find somewhere with brilliant snorkeling options . A place where I would n't be herded onto a massive boat and plopped onto a snorkeling site with 3 other massive boatloads of tourists ( *ahem* Cairns ) . <p> Then I thought : an island ! By nature , being holed up on a tiny remote island would restrict the number of people likely to get all up in my snorkel mask . With 900 of them in the Great Barrier Reef , my island options were plentiful and overwhelming . All I wanted to know was which Great Barrier Reef island had the best snorkeling at an affordable price tag ? I sought a budget-friendly , authentic reef experience , and Google was telling me that no less than 50 options met the bill . Thaaaaaaaanks , Google . <p> Ultimately , I rolled my imaginary 50-sided dice and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Read on and see ! <h> Welcome to Lady Elliot Island ! <p> Lady Elliot Island sits at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef , about 80km northeast of Bundaberg . As the most remote regularly accessed island in the reef , it 's only accessible by charter plane ( from Bundaberg , Hervey Bay , Brisbane , and the Gold Coast ) . The island covers just 100 acres : one half contains the Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort , while the other half is reserved for bird nesting . Only guests of the resort are allowed access to Lady Elliot Island , making my fear of uber-tourism a non-issue . <p> Now , that 's all well and good , but here 's the REAL reason why I chose Lady Elliot Island over anywhere else in the Great Barrier Reef : <p> Lady Elliot Island is a coral cay . As in : the island is made of coral , and built on the reef . <p> This means you can quite literally walk off the beach and into the reef , no boat trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reef whenever and as often as I wanted was priceless . <h> Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort <p> The island 's resort is pretty basic , but in my mind that 's a good thing because a ) . Basic = less expensive , and b ) . The resort is n't meant to compete with the island 's main attraction , the reef . <p> You can choose between a suite , a reef or garden unit , or an eco hut the latter being the most rustic , cheap , and obvious choice for the solo traveler . It 's not a bad setup , either : two bunk beds , a fan , and plenty of outlets for charging batteries . It 's more than what I needed for my reef getaway , anyway . The huts do n't lock , but there 's a safe at reception to store your valuables . <p> Included with your stay are breakfast and dinner , snorkel gear , reef walking shoes , and one snorkel boat trip . Oh , and plenty of daily activities such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guided reef walks catering to all the families that stay at the resort . I say without the slightest exaggeration that I was the ONLY solo traveler on the island . I have no idea why this was the case , and perhaps the clientele has changed in recent years , but I was more than ok with it because it meant I usually had the reef to myself whenever I went snorkeling . <p> You can also book scuba courses and dives on Lady Elliot Island , if that 's your jam . I had but one thing on my holiday agenda , and it was SNORKELING . <h> Snorkeling at Lady Elliot Island <p> I quickly fell into a rhythm of rolling out of bed just before the breakfast buffet ended ( once a night owl , always a night owl ) , grabbing a quick bite , and venturing into one of the reefs just off the island . I had some of the world 's best snorkeling right on my vacation doorstep , and I can tell you I took FULL advantage of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to stumbling upon a secret passageway . You ca n't just hop in anywhere because you 'll scrape up your stomach if you try to snorkel too shallow . You 've got to look for a dark spot , a break in the reef , where you can enter . <p> Once you 're in , you soon find yourself in a maze of coral , swimming side-by-side with schools of fish . You 're chasing all the colors of the rainbow . You have no idea where you 're going , but you follow the reef and the fish which lead you to more of the same , but different sometimes even better . You see the occasional sea turtle gliding up and down from the surface , completely unfazed by your presence . <p> I was just enamored . I could n't imagine it getting any better then I turned to my right and saw a manta ray just a few feet away , very close to the surface . OHMYGOD I SWAM WITH A MANTA RAY ! I 'm still not over it , 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely organic experience . I did n't pay anyone to take me to a planned-out swim with a manta ray ; instead , I accidentally spotted one while straying a bit too far from the reef , all by myself . That made it infinitely more special . <p> Once I tired from snorkeling , I 'd retreat to the beach and lay out with a book ( or my philosophy class reading , if my handwritten journal is to be trusted ) . Depending on the tides , I might venture to the resort side of the island to do some reef walking . It 's definitely worth donning a pair of borrowed reef shoes and walking out into this designated area at least once during your stay . I loved it for allowing me to get a closer look at the biggest most colorful clams in existence : <p> I took one ( complimentary ) snorkel boat trip out to Second Reef a bit further out and it was fantastic , albeit too short of an excursion . But nothing could compare to my independent snorkeling adventures around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how any future snorkeling or diving excursion could ever top it . <p> It 's one of those experiences I still remember vividly , that I 'll keep remembering for the rest of my life . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> In September 2006 I purchased the *Stay 5 , Pay 4 Nights* Eco Hut solo package at $995 AU ( $750 US ) , which included a return flight from Hervey Bay . <p> As of November 2014 The same *Stay 5 , Pay 4* Eco Hut solo package costs $928 AU ( $809 US ) and does not include a return flight , which costs an additional $275 AU ( $240 US ) for Hervey Bay other locations may be priced differently . In total , you 'll pay $1203 AU ( $1049 US ) for a 5 night stay as a solo traveler on Lady Elliot Island . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Andrew T Saylor <p> Oh my gosh . This was such a beautiful place to snorkel . My favorite so far . We stayed 4 days I believe , and snorkeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of turtles , and a bluespotted stingray . SO COOL ! Sometimes I dream about living on the island the rest of my life , waking up just in time to eat an amazing breakfast buffet , snorkeling and free diving all day , and sleeping in a windblown tent at night . I even made friends with the birds ; one watched as my wife and I played ping pong outside . Ca n't say enough good things about LEI . Are you planning to migrate to Aus for good ? We 'd really love to , but I must get a visa first . Great article and amazing pictures btw ! <p> It was definitely my favorite as well ! Ooh so cool that you saw some sharks there , I do n't  think I did when I was on LEI . Still , it was a completely amazing experience and I 'd definitely go back in a heartbeat ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118792985 @7792985/ <h> Bangkoks Chatuchak Market : A Taste of Thailand <p> Of the 4 weekend days I 've spent in Bangkok , I 've gone to the Chatuchak Weekend Market on 3 of them : <p> First time went for a look-see ' to scope things out , sample the snacks , and take note of things I might want to buy next time ( the idea being to return after my upcoming jaunt through Southern Thailand , so I would n't have to carry around extra crap for those couple of weeks ) <p> Second time went with some boys and did n't want to drag them along to do some girl shopping <p> Third time went on my own to finally do said shopping ! <p> Thus , given my excellent market attendance ratio , I feel like I 'm fairly qualified to give you the lowdown on the Chatuchak Market ( aka the JJ Market , to locals ) . It 's definitely a must-do if you 're in Bangkok on a weekend even if you 're not big on shopping , there is plenty else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southeast Asia and you 'll find locals and tourists alike browsing the stalls . <p> What I love about the Chatuchak Market is that you 're never hassled or ripped off there . You 're free to get lost in the maze of stalls and play the bargaining game whenever you feel like making a purchase . With a great mix of souvenirs vs. common goods , tourists vs. locals , and shopping vs. dining , the Chatuchak Market is the perfect place to get a balanced taste of Thailand . <h> Getting to Chatuchak Market <p> The JJ Market is very easy to get to . You can either take the skytrain to Mo Chit , then traverse the park to get to the outskirts of the market or the BTS to Kamphaeng Phet which will let you off right into the market . Note : You could also take the BTS to the Chatuchak stop , but it 's actually not as close to the market . <h> Navigating the Chatuchak Market <p> The Chatuchak Market operates on Saturdays and Sundays and spans over 35 acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many sources recommend Nancy Chandlers comprehensive map to the market , but it 's more fun to get lost exploring on your own ! <p> Similar types of items tend to be grouped together in the same section ( e.g. used goods , clothing , shoes , jewelry , plants , home goods , food ) . At the entrance to each aisle , there is a sign above that denotes the section number and category . <p> Tip : If you see something you 're very interested in buying , do n't wait to buy it you may never find the stall again ! <h> Eating and Drinking at Chatuchak Market <p> I highly recommend coming to the market with an empty stomach . Food there is cheap , plentiful , and delicious . <p> As with the whole of Bangkok , or any city/town in Thailand , you 'll find food offered by three sorts of proprietors : <p> Street Cart Vendors Perfect for a quick snack or drink , you can snag some meat on a stick , fresh fruit , an iced tea/coffee , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic snacks , like fried quail eggs , on offer . <p> Open Air Cafes Duck into a cafe on the market walkways for a small meal for about $1.50 . The standard soups , noodle and rice dishes are most commonly on the menu . <p> Restaurants Tucked into the market are some actual restaurants that have AC , proper seating , and alcoholic beverages . A great escape from the heat and crowds outside ! <p> I 'm a big fan of the fresh coconut ice cream , served in coconut shells with various toppings of your choice . Also , the fresh coconut shakes at the market are possibly the best I 've had in Thailand . <p> Tip : Be warned , bottled water is much more expensive in the market than outside of it . BE FRUGAL ! If you can bring a large bottle in with you , you should be set for most of the day . <h> Shopping at Chatuchak Market <p> You can easily do the bulk of your souvenir shopping at Chatuchak Market . Everything you could possibly want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found here . <p> As usual , you should bargain for everything . Always start out with a super-low price , then work your way up to something a bit more reasonable that the shopkeeper will agree on . <h> Other Services at Chatuchak Market <p> Do n't worry if you 've had yourself a shopping spree , there are a few outlets in the market that will ship packages overseas for you . <p> And if you 've spent too much time on your feet carrying shopping bags , you can treat yourself to a massage right in the market ! Hour-long foot , neck/shoulders/back , and full body massages can be had for 200-250 baht ( $7.50-9 ) . I had the most satisfying foot massage at Chatuchak Market it was at times painful , but felt so amazing after the fact ! ( Those are my feet on the right in the photo above ! ) <h> Chatuchak Market : A Must-Do in Bangkok <p> To sum it up , every visitor to Bangkok should check out the Chatuchak Market to : 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

True , it can be cumbersome to make the long trek into the city from this side of the Thames , but there 's plenty to love in Zones 3 and 4 . <p> here 's a look at 3 cool neighborhoods in South London : Kingston , Brixton , and Wimbledon . <h> Kingston <p> We spent an afternoon in the aptly-named Kingston-upon-Thames . Its got a unique blend of old and new : stone buildings and canals contrasted against chain stores and supermarkets . <p> My favorite thing to do in Kingston is walk across the river to the northern bank , stretch out on a blanket in the grass by the waterfront , and crack open a bottle of wine . In warmer weather , you 'll see rowers and kayakers getting a good workout in , as well as people taking their houseboats out for a spin . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars and restaurants right on the river , which made me thankful to have escaped the noise from the other side . <h> Brixton <p> I got to know Brixton very well , making about 5 trips to this South London hood during my last London trip . I credit Federation Coffee and their insanely addicting flat white for inspiring at least 4 of those visits . <p> If you go to Brixton , be sure to hit up the Brixton Village , an indoor space with some really cute cafes , vintage shops , bakeries , and produce vendors . And , of course , its home to the aforementioned purveyor of addicting coffee . Do n't  miss it ! <p> Just outside is the main Brixton Market , which sprawls the surrounding streets with vendors selling African and Caribbean produce and cheap goods . A large portion of Brixtons residents are from these particular communities , making it quite a diverse neighborhood . <p> Outside of the markets , Brixton has a lot going on . Its got grit , churches , and thrift stores ( hows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse and has plenty of character , which makes wandering around this neighborhood a joy . Highly recommended ! <h> Wimbledon <p> My time in London happened to coincide with the Wimbledon Finals . Unfortunately it was lost on me , as I 'm not exactly a tennis lover so Hot Arms and I did not wait out for tickets . We DID , however , stumble across a match being televised on a big screen in the town square , and in the name of cultural immersion I made myself stand and watch for about 15 minutes . People had schlepped out with their fold-up chairs and umbrellas , well prepared for a day sitting out in the sun . <p> We came prepared as well for a picnic in Wimbledon Park ! Picnicking quickly became my favorite cost-saving outdoor thing to do in London . We 'd stock up on fresh bread and fixins at Sainsbury , grab a bottle of wine ( are you surprised ? ) , and make our own sandwiches while relaxing under a tree . Best way to spend an afternoon ! <p> Wimbledon village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit hub , and plethora of pubs . Shopping and dining are surprisingly excellent here , though I hope Wimbledon ups the ante on its coffee shops ! Perhaps by my next London visit there will be decent coffee in town ? <h> Have you been to South London ?

There may have even been smoke signals sent from this nutty nation by my hand . But in case you do n't remember , let us look back at some of the laughably unfortunate incidents I endured : <p> Was followed around , ripped off repeatedly , and stared at by men in Delhi <p> Nevertheless , I look back on my 3.5 weeks in India in awe of everything ridiculous that happened to me , and of all the beautiful things I saw . I even said in my wrap-up post : " Traveling India is like an addictive game . I got my ass kicked in Round 1 , but it 's left me determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South India ! ) . " <p> I 've heard nothing but rave reviews of Southern India , from my friend who studied in Goa , to an Aussie I met in Kathmandu who had motorbiked through jungles and taken copious selfies with the local kids , to my Swiss friend who spent a month surfing on the coast . The resounding verdict was that Southern India is way more chilled out than the north . Clearly I had missed that memo before I traveled to India . <p> I want to go back to India and do it right . Except this time , to Kerala . <p> Kerala occupies a sliver of land in the southwest part of India , blessed with a stunning coastline as well as mountains and lush green land . Surfing and houseboating down the backwaters are two popular things to do in Kerala . <p> In addition to being exceedingly beautiful , Kerala is the safest area in India .

Normally I am adamant about solo travel I love it , it suits me , it 's how I travel best . But India operates under an entirely different rule set , and my normal solo travel strategy completely faltered there during my first trip . If there 's ever a place where group travel is almost necessary , it 's India . <p> Here 's the thing .

I even said in my wrap-up post : " Traveling India is like an addictive game . I got my ass kicked in Round 1 , but it 's left me determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South India ! ) . " <p> I 've heard nothing but rave reviews of Southern India , from my friend who studied in Goa , to an Aussie I met in Kathmandu who had motorbiked through jungles and taken copious selfies with the local kids , to my Swiss friend who spent a month surfing on the coast . The resounding verdict was that Southern India is way more chilled out than the north . Clearly I had missed that memo before I traveled to India . <p> I want to go back to India and do it right . Except this time , to Kerala . <p> Kerala occupies a sliver of land in the southwest part of India , blessed with a stunning coastline as well as mountains and lush green land . Surfing and houseboating down the backwaters are two popular things to do in Kerala . <p> In addition to being exceedingly beautiful , Kerala is the safest area in India .

Normally I am adamant about solo travel I love it , it suits me , it 's how I travel best . But India operates under an entirely different rule set , and my normal solo travel strategy completely faltered there during my first trip . If there 's ever a place where group travel is almost necessary , it 's India . <p> Here 's the thing . Now that I 'm living in Australia with no ties to a corporate job and closer proximity to India , I can actually afford to do this . I do n't know exactly what my end goal is , but I know that moving here was a huge step in the right direction . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing .

True , it can be cumbersome to make the long trek into the city from this side of the Thames , but there 's plenty to love in Zones 3 and 4 . <p> here 's a look at 3 cool neighborhoods in South London : Kingston , Brixton , and Wimbledon . <h> Kingston <p> We spent an afternoon in the aptly-named Kingston-upon-Thames . Its got a unique blend of old and new : stone buildings and canals contrasted against chain stores and supermarkets . <p> My favorite thing to do in Kingston is walk across the river to the northern bank , stretch out on a blanket in the grass by the waterfront , and crack open a bottle of wine . In warmer weather , you 'll see rowers and kayakers getting a good workout in , as well as people taking their houseboats out for a spin . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars and restaurants right on the river , which made me thankful to have escaped the noise from the other side . <h> Brixton <p> I got to know Brixton very well , making about 5 trips to this South London hood during my last London trip . I credit Federation Coffee and their insanely addicting flat white for inspiring at least 4 of those visits . <p> If you go to Brixton , be sure to hit up the Brixton Village , an indoor space with some really cute cafes , vintage shops , bakeries , and produce vendors . And , of course , its home to the aforementioned purveyor of addicting coffee . Do n't  miss it ! <p> Just outside is the main Brixton Market , which sprawls the surrounding streets with vendors selling African and Caribbean produce and cheap goods . A large portion of Brixtons residents are from these particular communities , making it quite a diverse neighborhood . <p> Outside of the markets , Brixton has a lot going on . Its got grit , churches , and thrift stores ( hows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse and has plenty of character , which makes wandering around this neighborhood a joy . Highly recommended ! <h> Wimbledon <p> My time in London happened to coincide with the Wimbledon Finals . Unfortunately it was lost on me , as I 'm not exactly a tennis lover so Hot Arms and I did not wait out for tickets . We DID , however , stumble across a match being televised on a big screen in the town square , and in the name of cultural immersion I made myself stand and watch for about 15 minutes . People had schlepped out with their fold-up chairs and umbrellas , well prepared for a day sitting out in the sun . <p> We came prepared as well for a picnic in Wimbledon Park ! Picnicking quickly became my favorite cost-saving outdoor thing to do in London . We 'd stock up on fresh bread and fixins at Sainsbury , grab a bottle of wine ( are you surprised ? ) , and make our own sandwiches while relaxing under a tree . Best way to spend an afternoon ! <p> Wimbledon village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit hub , and plethora of pubs . Shopping and dining are surprisingly excellent here , though I hope Wimbledon ups the ante on its coffee shops !

@@118793006 @7793006/ <h> How To Prepare For The Ultimate Kauai Road Trip <p> I recently embarked on my second road trip around the- Hawaiian islands . Someday I will write about the epic adventures I had driving around the Big Island back in my pre-blog days ( until then , this guide to trekking to Waimanu Valley will have to do ) . <p> First things first : were going to make this a camping road trip . With an island as green and gorgeous as Kauai , you 're going to want to be immersed in nature as much as possible . If you are super anti-camping , you could always book Airbnbs around the island though honestly , there are n't  that many and the ones that exist are pretty expensive for what they are . <p> So let 's camp ! <p> After two years of living in Australia and being used to traffic on the left side of the road , not to mention 3+ years of- not driving , I was extremely nervous to get behind the wheel in Kauai . Like most things we worry about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow-going on the island . Remember , you 're on island time , and that means no rushing , ever . It takes about an hour ( maybe slightly more ) to drive from Lihue to the end of the road in either direction . Note that you ca n't drive along the west coast , so you 'll have to backtrack to get between the north and south coasts . <p> I 'd highly recommend ordering yourself a copy of- The Ultimate Kauai Guide Book- before your Kauai roadtrip . This book will be your Bible for all Kauai adventures . I had the Big Island version of the book for my other road trip and found some really cool offbeat spots that I never would have known about otherwise , and I 'm happy to report the same for the Kauai book . JUST BUY IT trust me . You will be so glad you did . <p> Lastly , beware of the roosters ! A friend mentioned the roosters to me before I left and I thought , uh , ok then . But then I got to Kauai and suddenly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake you up before sunrise while you 're camping . They will try to hop inside your tents and steal your food . In short , they are annoying AF and there 's absolutely no thing you can do but embrace it . <p> Alright , let 's get into the nitty gritty for how to prep for your Kauai roadtrip ! <h> Car Rentals in- Kauai <h> Kauai Van Rental <p> Unlike in other gloriously scenic places , campervans are not so much a thing in Kauai . However , if you have your heart set on getting a taste of Van Life , you can rent a VW Westfalia from- Kauai Camper Rental- ( $155/day , cooking supplies included ) or a converted camper van from Camperventures Kauai- ( $140/day + $40/day for cooking supplies ) . <p> Renting a campervan- is definitely pretty pricey ; add on to it the fact that van camping is only allowed in two places in Kauai and this option makes even less sense . Still , its there if you want to splurge on a cool Kauai road trip experience . <h> Kauai Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleeping in- a tent will make the most logical and economical sense for their road trip . Kauai car rentals are mostly done- in Lihue , near the airport . Most if not all of the car rental companies will provide a complimentary airport pickup/dropoff service to customers , which means you can go straight from baggage claim to the rental counter within minutes . <p> I do n't  have any specific recommendations for Kauai car rental companies because to me , the cars are all the same and I just wanted the cheapest option available . I searched on Kayak for car rentals in Lihue and the cheapest I found was a- Chevy Spark ( aka small-ass car ) - with Dollar at- US$234 for 9 days ( $26/day ) without add-ons . This was the smallest and cheapest option available one month in advance- and was definitely cozy for two people and massive amounts of luggage and camping gear . If you have more than 2 people for your Kauai road trip I 'd recommend shelling out a bit more money for a roomier car. - We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve credit card provides insurance on any car rental booked with the card . <p> Waimea Canyon . <h> Camping Gear &amp; Other Supplies <p> When it comes to being well equipped for your Kauai camping road trip , you 'll either need to bring , buy , or rent your gear or some combination of the three . <h> Buying Camping Gear <p> Because I 'd be hiking the Kalalau Trail after my Kauai road trip , there were a few key camping/hiking items of mine that I definitely wanted to bring with me because I knew they a ) . Worked well , and b ) . Were easily carry-able on hikes . So I had my own tent and sleeping mat and literally nothing else I needed- for camping when I got to Kauai . <p> Thankfully there 's a Walmart and a Kmart in Lihue where you can find most everything you 'll need for road tripping and camping in Kauai , and for super cheap ! Walmart had tents for $28 , sleeping bags for $25 , and air mattresses for $15 , but note that the cheapest options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your shopping . We also sourced a decent portion of our food stuff from Walmart and supplemented it with fresh produce from the supermarket . <p> Pro Tip : Skip the sleeping bag and buy cheap sheets and a fleece blanket at Walmart instead . Its not cold enough at night in Kauai to need a sleeping bag ( unless you 're camping at Kokee ) . - <h> Renting Camping Gear <p> If you only have a few days to road trip and camp in Kauai , or do n't  want to buy any- extra gear upon arrival because it wont fit in your luggage- to take home- and you do n't  want to throw it out at the end , then you may want to rent camping gear in Kauai . <p> If you 're looking for both camping and other outdoor gear , Kayak Kauai is probably your best bet ; if you mostly just want all sorts of camping gear , Kauai Camper Rental has a more extensive array of options . <p> Camping at Salt Pond Beach Park in Kauai . <h> Where to Camp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kauai which means you must book and pay for your campsites in advance . County park campsites are cheap , right on the beach , and have basic facilities while state park campsites are a bit pricier but more remote and immersed in nature . <h> Camping in County Parks <p> Kauai County Parks offer- the best value accommodation around . For just $3/night per person , you can pitch your tent on a plot of grass with a view of the beach , BBQs , and a bathroom block nearby . There are currently 7 beach parks open for camping , but each one closes on a certain day of the week to prevent people from squatting at one park for too long . <p> You ca n't book your campsites in advance online , only by regular mail with payment- via check aka NOPE . But do n't  worry , you wont have any issues waiting until you arrive to book your campsites with cash . Check the Kauai County website to find out where you can stop in to book your camping permits . Permit locations are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure your permit is visible inside the clear sleeve provided with them , and attach the sleeve to one of your tent poles once you pitch your tent . Park rangers routinely check permits , often at the crack of dawn , and will wake you up if they cant see that you have a valid camping permit for that night . <h> A Note on Safety <p> Kauai County Parks are open and easily accessible off of main roads , so there is a chance of crazy characters venturing into the park where they do n't  belong . We experienced one such character at Haena Beach Park on the North Shore , who bumbled into the camping area- babbling and then shouting around the bathroom block around midnight . Another camper must have called the police because the cops came shortly after and roamed the park with flashlights searching for him . I slept through the entire thing so I cant say I was scared , but I 'd advise being cautious and maybe pitching your tent near others . <p> Camping at Polihale Beach . <h> Camping in State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are immersed in nature and removed from the main roads : <p> Polihale State Park Accessible via a very long dirt road , this campsite is well worth the bumpy drive because you get to camp right in the sand dunes and watch sunset over Kauais west coast . ( There is much discussion re : - getting stuck in sand on this road and- car rental companies not covering any damage or towing personally , we were absolutely fine driving slow on the road and just avoided any sandy bits and did n't  get stuck . ) <p> Napali Coast State Wilderness Park This is the campsite to- book if you 're hiking the Kalalau Trail ( the permit is good for either Kalalau Beach or Hanakoa ) . Be sure to book as far in advance as you can because permits sell out early . <p> Kokee State Park - Makes a great base for exploring nearby Waimea Canyon and the Kokee State Park trails , but it gets significantly colder here at night due to the higher elevation . <p> These campsites can be booked online in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast campsites ) . They include toilet blocks and possibly a seating area , but no electricity . You should probably print your permit out and have it on hand in case a ranger stops by to check , but because the state parks are so remote they are n't  around- every day to do this . <p> Camping at Haena Beach Park . <h> Other Camping Options <p> Well , there are n't  many other options , BUT we did accidentally come across Kumu Camp while trying to reach Anahola Beach Park after dark , thanks to a wrong turn . Their tent sites cost $20/night and are nestled in the trees behind Anahola Beach . With the fairy lights at night and the privacy of having our own campsite , it was a nice change from sharing a grass lawn with several other campers. - They also have some affordable bungalows for rent . <p> We were able to walk in and pitch our tents without a booking , but if you know in advance that you want to book a campsite , you can do that via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ive become a very big fan of breaking up a lengthy camping trip with a night or two in a really nice hotel . I find sleeping in a ridiculously comfy bed and indulging in other luxury comforts such a treat after several days of roughing it . Even with this splurge , you can save money compared to if you had spent every night in a budget hotel or Airbnb . <p> Now , you could either save the hotel splurge for the end of your trip if you cant bear the thought of downgrading to a tent again afterwards or you could schedule it more towards the middle of your trip so that you have a chance to clean up and refresh yourself before venturing back out into the wild for your second camping stint . <p> We chose the latter and went all out by booking a night at the St. Regis Princeville . I 'd also been looking into booking a room at the- Grand Hyatt Kauai near Poipu , but ultimately we decided we wanted to luxuriate with the scenic backdrop of Hanalei Bay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We were absolutely kicking ourselves for not booking two nights because we loved this hotel SO MUCH . But then we hit the road again and returned to the rustic comforts of our trusty tents and loved being back in nature , too . Splurging on a fancy hotel in the middle of our Kauai road trip was an excellent decision for us . <p> Infinity pool at the St. Regis Princeville . <h> Travel Insurance For Hawaii <p> Last but not least : do n't  start your Kauai road trip without booking travel insurance ! It can cover you in the case of a car accident , injury from an adventure activity , or travel/baggage delays . <p> As I always do , I got my travel insurance through World Nomads . I 'd already had a 6-month policy from previous travels that covered me during my Hawaii trip , but I bought a 3-week extension to cover me for the remainder of my time in the US. 3 weeks of coverage costs $89 , while 6 months of coverage costs $335 and is the best value policy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much travel insurance- for your Hawaii trip will cost : 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

You 'll be guided through the process of listing your tour step-by-step , which basically boils down to the following : <p> List your tour : Select your city , type and length of tour ; then bring your tour to life by adding a description of what Travellers can expect when they book it . Easy ! I really dig their lengthy list of tour types ( chillout , hidden gems , music , mystery , photography to name a few ) , but I wish there was the option of marking a tour with more than one type . What if I wanted to offer a cycling photography tour would I call it a cycling tour , or a photography tour ? <p> Set up payment : When you add your tour to Ventoura , you 'll set a price to charge for it ( anywhere from 5 EUR and up ) , and a payment method ( either PayPal or cash ) . Note that there 's an 18% transaction fee per tour booking for use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the tour has taken place . <p> Swipe : You know the drill by now : swipe right if you like the person , or left if you do n't . In the name of maximizing your tour bookings , I 'd assume that you 'd swipe right to every single Traveller that pops up . Turning on the auto-matching function accomplishes this as well . <p> Manage tour bookings : You can easily access all your current and past tour bookings right in the Ventoura app . There 's even an option in the settings to turn on an alert to remind you about upcoming tours . <h> Should You Use Ventoura ? <p> I think Ventoura has the potential to become something really rad in the virtual travel world . The app is making it easier to connect with people from another culture and share a fun local experience together and that 's what travel 's all about . <p> To its credit , Ventoura has cleverly taken advantage of the left/right hot-or-not swipe phenomenon that 's made Tinder such a hit in the past year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it catches on . Thanks to this familiarity , Locals and Travellers all intuitively know that swiping right means they 're interested though it 's not clear exactly *what* they 're indicating interest in . Meeting up ? Hooking up ? Travelling together ? Booking or selling a tour ? It could mean any number of things . I 'm not sure if this is good or bad , but I 'm eager to experiment with it once I 'm in a city with Ventoura Locals . <p> That said , I 've not been able to fully take advantage of the Ventoura platform due to geography limitations . I tried it out last month when I was traveling in Perth , hoping to find some like-minded Travellers to go on road trips with or meet up with for coffee in the city , but found the user base in this remote , Local-less city was very small . <p> If I were still living in New York , I 'd be ALL over this app hell , I would n't have to rely on Tinder to tame my Wanderlust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little extra money just by showing foreigners a good time in my city . BUT New York is n't an option on Ventoura yet , so I would n't be able to join as a Local . Major bummer . <p> Which leads me to reiterate a serious and obvious limitation of the app : You can only join Ventoura as a Local if you are offering a tour in a particular city . I know Ventoura has plans to expand in the near future , and when they do I 'd love it if they could : <p> Open the app up to Locals worldwide , not just in Europe <p> Open the app up to Locals even if they are n't offering a tour <p> Allow Locals to offer more than one tour at a time <p> With those three things taken care of , I think Ventoura will be a hit . I 'll definitely be giving it another go when I 'm in a city with a larger user base . <p> So should you use Ventoura ? If you 're not in Europe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities just yet . But if you are in Europe , YES take a tour , give a tour , make some friends then report back , because I 'm interested to hear about your experience ! <h> This article was brought incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Such a well-balanced review ! I love that you offer up criticisms as well so we readers can actually trust what you 're saying is your unbiased opinion . That said , the app sounds AWESOME ! ! combining Tinder and travel , um , dream come true ? I cant wait to check it out more once it grows . Sadly I 'm only based in Europe for a few more days ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Aw , thanks girl ! I was gon na say , man , you 'd have a field day if you were still in BCN !

@@118793015 @7793015/ <h> Getting Around London is Easier Than You Think ! <p> So you 're going to London . You 're gon na bop around town on the Tube every day to get from your ho(s)tel to Buckingham Palace to Westminster to god knows where . That was my plan , too until I actually got there and realized how EXPENSIVE the London Underground is ! <p> I did n't  realize there were other , more affordable options for getting around London . For example , if you can find a bus that will get you right where you want to go , it will cost you less than half of what youd pay for the Tube . There is also a bike share program , which is excellent value for a days worth of riding around the city . <p> What 's more , the city of London has maps posted what seems like every couple blocks see photo , stage right **28;292;TOOLONG <p> I found myself relying on these every day to realign myself if I was n't sure which direction I was headed in . These map stands point you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also display your current location on a local map a la a " you are here " marker . I found this to be invaluable while I was frolicking around London without a map or an iPhone app to reference . <p> So what are your options for getting around London ? Allow me to enlighten you ! <h> London by Tube <p> London transportation is practically synonymous with the Tube , its metro system . Between the ubiquitous Mind the Gap signs on the platform and the plush seating on the trains , you cant NOT hop on it at some point during your time in London . <p> Fares are calculated by distance traveled , which is determined by the zones in which you start and finish your journey . If you stick to the city center and nearby surrounds , you 'll likely stick to zones 1-2 . Zones 3-4 are the start of the suburbs , which was where I was based during my 2.5 weeks in London in 2013 . Anything beyond that is FAR and expensive to get to . <p> You 'll want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your trips its far cheaper than paying cash for each ride . For instance , a quick trip in the city would cost -2.10 with the Oyster , and -4.50 if you pay in cash . With the Oysters electronic prepaid system , you tap your card on the card readers when you enter and leave a station and it auto-debits your account . Easy and efficient ! <h> How does it work ? <p> Peak travel is considered weekdays from 6:30-9:30am and 4-7pm . <p> Using the Oyster Card , trips range from -2.10-6.70 ( $3.25-11 US ) for peak travel to -2.10-3.90 ( $3.25-6.25 US ) for off peak travel , depending on how far you go . <p> Paying cash , trips range from -4.50-7.80 ( $7.25-12.50 ) . <p> There are 9 fare zones : Zone 1 is the city center ; the further from the center you go , the higher the zone you 'll be in . <p> For more deets , check the TFL website for up-to-date fare information and a map of all the Tube lines . <h> London by Bus <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was a wonderful surprise ! First , for some reason I 'd thought that the double decker buses were reserved for those cheesy , overpriced tours . Turns out , these double deckers run the whole bus system . It is SO MUCH FUN to sit on the top level in the front seat ! I never got tired of having a birds eye view of the street below . <p> Second , riding the bus is EASY . London buses stick to schedule . There are arrival-time clocks at bus stops that are actually accurate . You can use your Oyster card to pay for the ride . I never knew a bus system could be so efficient , but London seems to have nailed it . <p> Shortly into my stay , I realized I could reach the city in about the same amount of time while spending far less money on the bus rather than a subway ride . A zone 1-3 trip on the Tube cost me -2.70-3.20 ( off peak vs. peak ) , while a bus ride only ran me -1.40 , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus transfers are NOT free , so if you need to switch buses midway through your trip , you 'll be paying 2 bus fares . <p> Considering their ease of use , reliability , great views from the front seat of the top deck , and overall value , London buses might just be better than the London Underground . <h> London by Bike <p> I 'd peg London as a bike-friendly city . Its certainly no Amsterdam or Copenhagen , but cycling is growing in popularity as a way to get around town : in fact , the number of cyclists has more than doubled since 2000 . I was pleased to see a number of bike paths on the roads there. ; however , in most cases there are n't  dedicated bike lanes meaning there is often not room for both a cyclist and a driver to cruise down the road side-by-side . Not safe ! <p> There are talks of London getting an elevated bike network in the coming years , which would certainly address the issue of safety . <p> Nevertheless , safety concerns did n't  stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times . Its a great way to take advantage of beautiful weather on the rare occasions it decides to grace London with its presence . <p> In case any of you small towners are raising your eyebrows right about now , allow me to explain . Many cities around the world have implemented bike share programs in recent years . The concept is that you can take out and return a bike from docking stations all over the city within a short timeframe . Its similar to the concept of borrowing library books , except you pay an annual membership or a daily rate . You do n't  pay per bike ride unless you go over the time limit . <p> If you have an exact destination in mind , BCH is an efficient and affordable way to get from A to B quickly . However , its not meant for leisurely rides with no end in sight ( unless you 're cool with paying additional fees for the extra time ) . If you 're planning on doing a bunch of touristy things in one day , its definitely worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd rather bike through parks and along the river just for fun , you 'd be better off hiring a regular bike for the day . <h> How does it work ? <p> You can rent a bike from any docking station by credit card . Youll be given a pin number , which you use to unlock a bike ; when you return it , make sure the bike is locked in the docking station . Each time you want to take out a bike , you just insert that same credit card at the kiosk and itll give you a new pin . <p> Passes are -2 for 24 hours , -10 for 7 days , and -90 for a year ( $3.25 , $16 , $145 US respectively ) . Youre allowed to take out a bike for up to 30 minutes for free ; overtime charges range from -1 if you 're just a little late in returning your bike , to -15 ( $24 US ) if you 're 3 hours late , to a whopping -50 ( $80 US ) if you take a bike out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) . <h> How would you get around London ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793018 @7793018/ <h> 5 Lessons Ive Learned from Travel Mistakes Ive Made <p> I 've learned a lot in my 10+ years of travel : about myself , about the world , about how to travel . <p> Lord knows I 've made all sorts of travel mistakes and as long as I keep traveling , I 'll keep making mistakes . But I try to learn from them and make them less and less over time , becoming a better traveler in the process which ultimately results in better travel experiences . <p> Here are 5 important lessons Ive learned while traveling : <h> 1 . Travel solo , or with people whose travel style meshes with yours <p> I took my first big trip when I was in 8th grade : a family vacation to Disney World , something I 'd been dreaming of my entire childhood . In typical Lindsay fashion , I planned the entire week out in excruciating detail . My family put up with my hyper-planning as I corralled them up and out of the hotel at some ungodly hour each morning so we could beat the crowds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the parks according to my schedule , and hit all the rides that I wanted to go on . I did every single thing I wanted to do at Disney World it really was my perfect trip . <p> Four years later , just after I graduated high school , we took another family vacation this time to Mexico , where we stayed at an all-inclusive resort just south of Cancun . My parents and sisters were in their version of heaven , content to lay on the beach all day , every day for a week ; I quickly grew restless and orchestrated a day trip to Chichen Itza which was rushed and ill-enjoyed . <p> These two big family trips highlighted one very important fact : that I am a selfish traveler . I make no apologies for this I believe that if you are going to invest a considerable sum of time and money into what 's likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience , you want to do it right you want to do it your way . Its unfair to make those you 're traveling with compromise too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who have a similar travel style . <p> Riviera Maya , Mexico <h> 2 . Do n't forget to eat and drink enough <p> This is not even remotely a problem for me in my day-to-day life , but when I travel I find that I tend to eat and drink less than I normally do . I get distracted by new ( shiny ! ) things and places and would rather stay engrossed in that excitement than take the time to nourish myself . Oh it 'll be fine , I 'll just have a big meal or big pitcher of water at the end of the day , I rationalize during the day . This thought process has backfired on more than one occasion : <p> The time I hiked all day in Zion Canyon with just one small water bottle and got sick from dehydration . The residual sickness stayed with me for the rest of this Southwest US roadtrip and I was n't able to fully enjoy it because I did n't feel well . <p> As much as I 'd like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal sustenance , this is both untrue and foolish . Its important to take care of yourself while traveling so that you 're able to enjoy your time and not have your plans ruined if you get sick . <p> Zion National Park <h> 3 . Pack backups of your most important items <p> Far be it for me , the girl who always travels with at least 3 bags , to give advice on how to pack for a trip . Speaking from recent experience though , I do have a few thoughtful questions to pose for anyone gearing up for a trip : <p> What are the things you absolutely CAN NOT travel without ? <p> How easy would it be to obtain a replacement for these things while on the road ? <p> Say you 're on a multi-week trek through Patagonia . If you 're asthmatic , what happens if you have trouble breathing on the trail and your inhaler malfunctions ? If you 're a professional photographer or overzealous amateur , what would you do if your one camera broke just before reaching Torres del Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what . So back that ish up ! Bring an extra inhaler ; bring a backup camera . Whether you 're in a remote area or simply in a country where its not so easy to obtain a particular medicine or piece of technology , it 's worth packing a little extra for the insurance and peace of mind of having backups for your most important items . <p> Andaman Sea , Thailand <h> 4 . Travel slowly and take the time to truly experience and get to know a place <p> I 've long been a champion of the Quality Over Quantity mantra , but it took several rushed trips for me to finally apply it to my travels . Yes , I 've had a few 2-week marathon vacations where I foolishly attempted the following : <p> A roadtrip covering the coast , the major cities , and no less than 4 inland national parks from San Francisco to Seattle . About half of that time was spent in the cities , and the other half driving 1000+ miles and exploring some nature along the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one day up the NorCal coast because I was over-ambitious in our route planning . <p> Traveling all over Spain , hitting 4 major cities that were n't even remotely close to each other . You know you 're over-extending yourself when you have to fly between two cities in the same ( relatively small ) country in order to cut down on travel time . <p> In earlier years , I was just so excited to be traveling that I wanted to go EVERYWHERE and do ALL OF THE THINGS . I still do but over time , I 've learned to curb my travel bingeing and accept that IT 'S OKAY that I wo n't see everything on one trip . I 've realized that it 's more fulfilling to spend more time experiencing fewer places . Better to get to know a place more thoroughly and intimately , rather than just scratch the surface of a few different places and spend too much of your already-limited time getting from A to B to C. <p> Not only will your travel experiences be better for taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of the US is a beautiful blur to me today , but the 5 days I spent on Lady Elliot Island 8 years ago are so clear that I can actually go back in my mind and relive the experience of snorkellng in a reef maze and turning my head right to see nothing but a big ol ' manta ray swimming past me . <p> The fact is , we retain more when we give ourselves more time to experience and process something , rather than cramming it into a shorter period of time . I want to look back on my adventures 5 , 10 , 50 years from now and think something a little deeper than " Oh , that was a good time " . <p> Redwood Forest , California <h> 5 . Allow more time than you think you 'll need <p> Of all the travel mistakes Ive made , this is the one that is the most difficult for me to stop making . As a person who is unapologetically 3-5 minutes late to everything , I know by now that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to , because I would rather be a few minutes late than early . I get immense satisfaction out of allotting *just enough time* for something , and minimizing time wasted ( in places I 'm not enthralled with , in airports , waiting for people to arrive , etc ) . <p> The problem is when *just enough time* turns into *not enough time* , which can be a big problem when you 're traveling for a certain number of days . Not having enough time has been a problem on more than one travel occasion for me : <p> Not budgeting enough time for places I ended up LOVING , such as Barcelona and Waimanu Valley . Had I traveled more slowly ( see #4 above ) , I 'd have had the flexibility to spend a bit more time in a place that I ended up loving before having to hop on a plane home . <p> Traveling with a soon-to-expire passport . Mine would be valid for *exactly* 6 more months as I was due to enter my last Asian country in 2013 ( most Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I had n't  expected my plans to change so drastically that I 'd want to enter a new country after that date , so I was " stuck " in Thailand for my last couple weeks in Asia . I should have renewed my passport before traveling to Asia so that I 'd have had more flexibility in my travels . <p> Not having enough time between flights to make a connection , e.g. on my recent trip to Colombia . Technically we had more than enough time to make our connection in Bogota , assuming our first flight took off from Cartagena as scheduled . But if it was delayed or cancelled ( as it was ) , we 'd miss the ONE flight from Bogota to New York that night . We should have booked one of the earlier flights to Bogota , even if it meant having more time than desired waiting at the Bogota airport before our next flight . <p> To avoid not having enough time for something , its better to schedule more time to cover fewer places or activities while traveling. 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793025 @7793025/ <h> Everest Base Camp Trek : Phaplu to Lukla <p> The traditional Everest Base Camp trek begins in Lukla . Fortunately for you , I 'm not traditional , and that 's definitely not my style of travel ! The off-the-beaten-path Everest Base Camp trek that I completed begins SOUTH of Lukla , in Phaplu or Jiri . Pre-Lukla vistas look something like this : <p> This post highlights the segment of the trek from Phaplu to Lukla . You can also read about the second segment , from Lukla to Base Camp . <h> The Route from Phaplu to Lukla <p> Most EBC trekkers fly into Lukla and head north from there , but you can fly into Phaplu instead and tack on an extra 4-5 days of trekking before reaching Lukla ( or alternatively , take a 10 hour bus ride to Jiri and add on an extra 8-9 days of trekking before Lukla ) . <h> Why Trek From Phaplu ? <p> I completed the trek from Phaplu to Lukla comfortably in 5 days , though it 's doable in 3-4 . <p> Now , why would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EBC ? I argue that starting the trek south of Lukla will give you a more well-rounded experience of the Khumbu . With the standard Lukla-EBC trek , you have nothing but dramatic alpine scenery a constant backdrop of snowy mountains . By contrast , the Phaplu-Lukla trek provides you with the following : <p> warmer weather <p> hilly , green scenery <p> livelier villages <p> less trekkers ( if any at all ! ) <p> better acclimatization before reaching higher altitudes <p> The trek itself is challenging at times : altitude will not cause any problems , but the steep up/down segments will leave you with burning thighs and shaking knees ! In particular , the stretch from Kharikhola to Lukla ( the last 2 days or so ) is relentless in its ascent from the valley and does not provide much in the way of scenery or attractions . Before Kharikhola , however , you are constantly rewarded as the trail winds through rice terraces , farmland , and small villages dotted with stupas and monasteries . <p> One of my favorite parts of the entire trek was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . These villages are almost entirely self-sufficient . Families grow their own vegetables , tend their own farm animals , and run their own tea houses . Anything else they need is transported from other villages via donkey or porter . <h> Villages from Phaplu to Lukla <h> Phaplu <h> Salleri <h> Junbesi <h> Jobhing <h> Kharikhola <h> The Children of the Himalayas <p> The children I encountered along the way were so friendly and curious !

Before long I had her sitting on my lap as we took turns hitting the shutter button on my camera for a little self-portrait action . Her laugh was so adorable ! Her habit of double-dipping her spoon in the sugar bowl , maybe not so much . But she was so precious that even someone who is n't the biggest fan of children ( ahem , me ) could n't help but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip for doing the Everest Base Camp trek is to start the trek south of Lukla . <p> Do it .

I am planning to go to EBC but without my own tent 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> There are lodges in every village you pass through , so you can just stay in one of those ! No one really camps on the trek , there 's not really a need when there are so many places to stay . You can order food and drink there as well ! <p> Marije Bouwman <p> Thanks a lot for ur answer ! It includes the trek between Phaplu and Lukla ? Since this area is less known .. <p> Hi there , I am considering doing this trek from Phaplu to Lukla then possibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kathmandu to Phaplu in mid-December ? And what will it like trekking from Phablu to Lukla and beyond at that time ? Will any lodges be open ? Cheers and thanks , Jim in Sydney ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Hey Jimmy ! I think it should be possible to fly to Phaplu in December . People do trek at this time of year and find it nicer because there are less crowds so if you can handle the cold and possible snow , it might be worth it ! <p> As for lodges , I 've heard that some do close over winter but there will always be some open in each village you pass through . Most lodge owners do not own multiple homes in Nepal , so they stay at their Himalayan lodge year-round . <p> Hey ! I-m planning to trek to Gokyo Ri this Decemeber . I want to trek to Lukla instead of flying there , so is there a set route or map that can help trekkers with no guides pr sherpas ? Also is there a way to travel to Phaplu from Kathmandu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yes , the route from Phaplu to Lukla is pretty straight forward , and definitely doable on your own with a map . There are plenty of tea houses in the villages along the way where you can stop and ask for help ( assuming they can speak a bit of English ! ) . And you can get from Kathmandu to Jiri by bus , but then youd have to trek in from Jiri ( which tacks on a couple extra days before you reach Phaplu ) . <p> Dil Gurung <p> You can drive to Phaplu from Kathmandu , It will takes 10-11 hours to reach to Phaplu . Few jeep leave every morning from Kathmand to Salleri/Phaplu . You can do this trek by yourself as well but still better to do with guide or porter for your safety and comfortable . You can do Gokyo Ri in December as well but it will be extremely cold , you should bring good quality trekking gear with you for you safety . <p> Hey Jon ! I do n't  have the breakdown of my itinerary anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US next month ( you may have to remind me though ! ) . If I recall correctly , most of this hike is easy going except for one day near the end where its mostly uphill , so you should be fine with distances . <p> Adam <p> Hi , is the flight to Phaplu more expensive or cheaper than the flight from Kathmandu to Lukla ? Also , what route did you take going back from Base Camp to Kathmandu ? <p> I think they 're about the same price ? And hiking down , we just retraced our steps and did n't  take any of the side trails . We flew out of Lukla , not Phaplu , to return to Kathmandu . 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793041 @7793041/ <h> Things You Should Know Before Hiking The Overland Track <p> As I admitted in a previous post , I did very little research before tackling the Overland Track in Tasmania . Beyond booking the trek and transportation and equipping myself with standard trekking gear , I really did n't know what I was getting into . <p> Suffice it to say that the Overland Track was a learning experience for me . Here are 5 things I wish I 'd known , which I 'd love for you to know , before hiking the Overland Track <h> 1 . You will 100% get wet <p> Whether or not it rains , you 'll be trudging through mud and puddles often throughout the trek , even in summer . Your feet WILL get wet . If it does rain , your everything will get wet . Here 's how to fight the soggy factor : <p> Pack an absurd amount of plastic bags of varying sizes/types and bag all your clothes and sleeping gear before putting them in your pack . This literally saved my ass when I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare bag to cover my sleeping bag before setting off to trek on a day that ended up being very rainy . Some of my fellow trekkers were n't so lucky and had a soggy night 's sleep . <p> Bring paper of some sort : newspaper is best , but notebook or book paper also works . When your boots get wet , crumble up sheets of paper and shove them in each boot . Leave them in overnight and by morning your boots will be much less wet ! <p> Invest in quality rain gear . My $8 thrift store UNIQLO rain jacket and $10 rain pants from amazon.com were kind of a joke after hiking in the rain for a couple hours . If you 're serious about hiking , shell out the money for quality gear that works and lasts . <h> 2 . The Overland Track is all about woods and wildlife <p> If your ideal hit of nature involves long walks through forest and all sorts of plant and animal life , you 'll love the Overland Track . However , as I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hiking . Most of the trail runs through forest , with only brief stints of mountainous or open terrain . In other words : it is nothing like the Everest Base Camp Trek or Laugavegur Trek . I 've never seen so many shades of green in my life ! <p> The Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service go through great lengths to preserve the land , building boardwalks and continually encouraging trekkers to stick to the path so as not to kill any plants just off of it . The plant life on the Overland Track really is remarkable and diverse , with hundreds of different trees , bushes , flowers , and fungi to observe . As for animals , I saw several pademelons ( like wallabies ) and a couple of tiger snakes ( Lord , did they give me a spook ! ) . I heard frogs , birds , and other unidentifiable critters on various parts of the trek as well . And if I were n't so darn oblivious , I likely would have observed far more ! <h> 3 . It is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two days , there was always a trail marker in sight ; sometimes two . I remember thinking to myself : boy , they sure do make this trail idiot proof . Then on Day 3 , I thought I 'd taken a wrong turn while stuck in an endless mud maze in the dark woods in the pouring rain , because I had n't seen a marker in what seemed like hours . Turns out there was no other turn to make and I had stayed on the trail despite the lack of trail markers on this one segment . The Overland Track is so well-trodden that you instinctively know where to walk without anyone or anything telling you . You 'll be reassured constantly as you walk over planks and man-made steps along the way . <h> 4 . Yes , it 's worth paying $200 for the Overland Track permit <p> I know you 're skeptical , and far be it for me to support shelling out money for something ( *ahem* , #frugal ) but here 's why it makes sense in this case : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instating a fee prevents overcrowding on the trail , which means less danger to the wildlife along it . <p> The money goes toward track preservation ( building/renovating boardwalks , huts , and facilities ) , removal of toilet waste and transportation of coal by helicopter , and wages for hut wardens and rangers . Without these costly endeavors , the Overland Track would n't be the great experience it is today . <h> 5 . Allow 5 days minimum to complete the trek more if you want to add on any side treks or summits <p> Do some research beforehand and determine whether any of the add-on options appeal to you . There are at least 5 mountain summits you can take on , each requiring an additional half day . It might make sense in some cases to stay two nights at one hut and dedicate one whole day to summitting a nearby mountain or embarking on a side trek ( the New Pelion hut is ideal for this ) . You might also consider the side trek to Pine Valley , which is best enjoyed with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know about hiking the Overland Track ?

@@118793043 @7793043/ <h> Surprise ! Lake Argyle is Actually Pretty Rad <p> Lake Argyle went down in the books as a place that pleasantly surprised me . I did n't have the highest of hopes that a massive man-made lake with a dam as its premier attraction would impress me but I could n't turn down a generous staff discount and free ride there the day after my contract at El Questro ended , so off I went . <p> And goodness , I 'm SO glad I gave Lake Argyle a chance . I had a fantastic couple days soaking up the sun and glorious lakeside views . Here 's what I ( along with my adopted ELQ family ) got up to <h> Lake Argyle Infinity Pool <p> It 's worth it to stay at the Lake Argyle Caravan Park just for access to its lakeside infinity pool , but even if you 're not staying overnight you can purchase a day pass . Within minutes of arriving , we made a beeline for the pool just in time to catch the golden hour light warming up the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake , but the sky is pretty all around . I did n't expect the water to be so chilly , though ! I 'm sure it feels amazing as a respite from the midday sun , but around sunset/sunrise you might be shivering in it . Or maybe that 's just me being a cold-intolerant wuss ? <p> While sunset 's a beautiful time to enjoy the Lake Argyle infinity pool , loads of other people will have the same idea . Just after sunset and right before the pool closes , you might be lucky enough to have it to yourself ; otherwise , aim to get there shortly after the pool opens in the morning . I hit the pool as soon as it opened , let the older folks take a quick dip , and I 'd say within a half hour I was by myself in the pool aka prime selfie time ! <h> Ord River Gorge Walk <p> After a day of sitting on a bus and an afternoon of lazing by the pool , I felt like I had to get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any hikes I could do from the caravan park . Slightly disappointed that there were only a couple of *walks* ( not hikes ) , all under 2km , I somewhat randomly resigned myself to the Ord River Gorge walk which starts just across the street from the park . <p> Sometimes I have to remind myself that I do n't always need to make a punishing trek to reap the reward of stunning landscape views . I only had to walk 10 minutes before I was smacked with this view : <p> This simple trail wound its way uphill and around the dam , offering similar views at varying angles . I was giddy with excitement at how beautiful Lake Argyle had turned out to be , how easy it had been to discover such a drastically different view from the one afforded at the park , and best of all : how I had this little slice of it all to myself that morning . <p> I sat perched on an overhang watching the cloud shadows pass over the gorge , waiting for the sun to light up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Lake Argyle Sunset Cruise <p> As a rule , you come to Lake Argyle to experience the lake cruise . Though the lunch cruise buffet was tempting , we opted for the sunset cruise instead . <p> Yeah , it felt a bit commercial and maybe some of the captain 's jokes were cringe-worthy , but none of that really matters when you 're on a boat with the wind in your hair and the sun on your skin . Throw in some islands kissed by the golden hour glow and big puffy cloud reflections on a still lake and it 's pretty easy to forget you 're on a tour with a bunch of families and retirees . <p> We got up close to some crocodiles , wallaroos , and exotic birds whose names I did n't bother making mental note of . Just before sunset , we stopped for a swim in the middle of the lake and I could n't get over how WARM the water was . How is the lake warmer than the infinity pool ? ! Too trippy . We all had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imbibing in some beer and wine while in the water . I 'm pretty sure I lost at least half of my wine to the lake while trying to tread water holding the plastic cup above my head , but constant refills made that a non-issue . <p> And then : sunset over Lake Argyle . Western Australian sunsets have a habit of being underwhelming at first , then igniting the sky about 15 minutes after the sun has disappeared .

@@118793044 @7793044/ <h> Can You Afford To Move To NYC ? <p> My first job out of college was at an investment bank just outside of NYC . <p> Ill pause here for a minute to let you absorb this ridiculous fact . <p> After a few weeks of commuting two hours each way from my parents house in Bumblef-ck , CT to my office in Stamford , it was clear my life had been reduced to a ( sometimes literal ) snoozefest . How did I get here ? , I wondered in disbelief . I may have been a clueless Cornell grad at the time , but this much I knew : I wanted my life to be awesome . I had to make a change . <p> So I decided to transfer offices and move to New York City ! <p> Then , being the hyper-rational human being that I am , my immediate thought was : Can I even afford to live in NYC ? <p> I tried my hand at putting together a budget , crunching numbers in hopes that they would spit out a YES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . Needless to say , they did n't  really do either . The truth is , if you live frugally , you can afford to move to NYC . <p> If you cut costs as much as you can share an apartment with roommates , hit up more affordable establishments , and take advantage of all the free stuff to do in New York your money will stretch far enough for you to make it here . Let me show you how ! <h> How To Find A Cheap Apartment in NYC <p> Real talk : You cant . No less than 9 out of 10 of those Most Expensive Cities In The US reports in the past 5 years have declared Manhattan and Brooklyn the #1 and #2 cities on the list . Why ? Because the rent is too damn high . It will far and away be your greatest expense while living in NYC , so you 've got to go into this expecting to spend a painfully large percentage of your income on your apartment . <p> So , you may not find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of money if you follow these tips : <h> Tips for finding a cheap NYC apartment <p> Live in a more affordable neighborhood Rule of thumb : if its conveniently located or where celebrities live , its likely not an affordable neighborhood . So avoid Midtown , the Village , and the Brooklyn waterfront . Instead , look into apartments in other hoods that are slightly less popular , yet safe and desirable : for example in far uptown Manhattan ( 125th St and above ) , the eastern half of the Upper East Side , East Williamsburg and Crown Heights/Prospect Heights in Brooklyn , or Astoria in Queens . <p> Live with roommates The average rent for a Manhattan studio is around $2000 . You do n't  need me to tell you what a downright ridiculous amount of money that is to be throwing at a teeny-tiny living space . You can easily spend less than half of that if you share an apartment with roommates . In general , the more bedrooms it has , the cheaper the apartment will be per person . Craigslist is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee The unfortunate reality is that these days , the NYC housing market is dominated by apartments strapped with brokers fees . The upside is that working with a broker simplifies the process as they do most of the legwork for you ; the downside is that you 'll pay at least a months rent worth in fees for the convenience . Instead , look for a " no-fee " apartment where you rent directly from the landlord . <p> Buy used furniture In addition to hosting apartment listings , Craigslist houses a great variety of " for sale " listings , from furniture and appliances to electronics and other household goods . On a smaller scale , Freecycle lists any free " recycled " items available in your city that the owner would otherwise donate or leave on the curb . If you 're willing to put in the time to search through listings and coordinate with item owners a time to go see and potentially procure it , you can easily save hundreds of dollars furnishing your apartment . <h> One other note on finding a NYC apartment : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never skimp at the expense of your health and safety . Check the crime records and bed bug history of your potential future hood to ensure you 're not about to move into a dangerous and/or infested area . <p> And while you 're at it : get renters insurance . It is WAY too cheap not to . Best of all , it should cover damage and loss to your luggage while you 're traveling ( except for expensive electronics , which would require an additional policy ) like the time my insurance company reimbursed me for everything when my suitcase was stolen off the baggage carousel at Newark Airport . <h> Cheap Food in NYC <p> One common misconception about New York is that eating here is so expensive . Sure , it CAN be but its also doable to grab dinner with a friend and spend less than $20 each on a simple meal . <p> For eating out , Yelp is a great resource to find highly rated restaurants at varying price points , in every neighborhood in the city . I 've also played with the Scoutmob iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( usually just on weeknights ) . Its been a fun way to try out new restaurants that I might not have otherwise ! <p> For a quick bite ( $5 or less ) , you cant go wrong in the land of pizza and bagels neither New York staple will set you back more than $1-2 apiece . For $3.50 , you can enjoy Mamouns legendary falafel sandwich or Bao Haus taro fries both of which are delicious , filling , and somewhat healthy . And for a little splurge re : both money and calories , $4.50 gets you the famous Shake Shack burger . <p> For delivery , I wait until I see a coupon in my email from Seamless ( 15% off is common on one random weekday each month ) or Delivery.com ( $8 off on most weekends ) and usually that inspires me to order food to be delivered from a nearby restaurant . With delivery fees and minimum order amounts , sometimes its not economical to order a meal just for one person but with these deals , its often cheaper to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Caracas Arepas in Brooklyn <h> Cheap Shopping in NYC <p> With retail stores lining 5th Avenue for quite literally its entire length south of Central Park , shopping is a very real temptation in NYC . But if you can resist it , you can save yourself a lot of money . <p> For basic clothes , check out H&amp;M and Target . Their $5 tees and $8 leggings can not be beat ! I 'm also a fan of the jeans at American Eagle : not only do their jeggings fit me like a glove , but if you can hit one of their buy one , get one half off sales AND throw a coupon at it , you could walk away with two pairs of sub-$25 jeans . <p> For " nicer " clothes , hit up the sales racks at some of the name-brand stores . My favorite Treat Yo Self shopping outing includes browsing the clearance rooms at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters , where I 've snagged really nice $20 skirts and $30 dresses in the past . But here 's the key : you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT look at anything else , lest you be tempted to purchase something at full price . <p> For groceries , do your weekly shopping at Trader Joes . They have the best value groceries in all of NYC , with a few locations spread throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn . TJs is my go-to for items I cant find in my neighborhood supermarket : very cheap nuts and almond butter , massive tubs of their branded hummus , and turkey burgers . If you 've got extra space in your apartment and do n't  mind trekking up to Harlem , consider signing up for a membership at Costco , where you can buy all sorts of food and household items in bulk at their warehouse for dirt cheap . <p> For additional savings , always search google for coupons and discount codes before you buy ! When you google " storename coupon " , Retailmenot is usually the first source that pops up , which aggregates various coupon codes found across the web and allows users to rate the code based on whether it worked for them or not . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pro tip : There is ALWAYS a 20% off code for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond floating around ) . <p> And finally , if you 're of the female persuasion , do yourself a favor and sign up immediately for the Victorias Secret mailings . It seems like once a month they mail me a coupon for a free pair of undies and $20 off a bra . I am not exaggerating when I say that my entire underwear collection is comprised of free VS garb . <h> Free &amp; Cheap Things To Do In NYC <p> One of my favorite things about NYC is summer and all the free outdoor activities that happen during it . There are all sorts of things happening here year-round including street fairs , markets , concerts , Christmas tree lightings , holiday parades , and gallery openings . <p> For deeply discounted shows , activities , and other attractions , browse the deals on Groupon and Living Social . Ive purchased vouchers for pilates classes , manicures , and a wine tour things I normally consider a splurge at just a fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in NYC , stay in the loop by following local blogs and subscribing to mailing lists .

HELL YES YOU CAN . You can afford to live in NYC , and to travel the world , if you have the drive and discipline to be frugal . Save your money , cut costs wherever possible , stop the impulse buying and make it a habit . You can even live in NYC while paying off your student loans because money should never be something that keeps you from going after your dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deliberately cheap as you will it to be .

Especially about the bed bugs websiteI would have NEVER thought to look at that , but its true , bed bugs are a huge problem in NY ! Maybe , considering your recent hesitations about NYC , you should write a post about whether or not NYC is worth the cost ? Doable , yes , but worth it ? Its a question that 's been on my mind a lot lately as I think about my next move , probably to San Francisco . Is any location worth handing ALL your months income over to rent ? Is an " under $20 meal " actually that cheap ? Things to think about . ( I think I 'm talking to myself here , but hey , thanks for listening ! ) 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Aw , I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs are such a thing here in NYC we totally checked that website before deciding on our last apartment . Not sure how essential it is in other cities though ! <p> Absolutely LOVE the idea of writing about whether its *worth* living in NYC thanks for the tip ! I 'm not sure I could imagine spending most of my 20s anywhere else , and I certainly do n't  regret it . But man , I could have banked a whole lot more money if I lived in , say , Austin or Denver . Or lived a bit more comfortably . Its all relative , though ! Oh and yes , an under-$20 meal means LITERALLY under $20 if you know where to go ! : P <p> Katie McGrain <p> Nice post ! I also like looking at the rat website , mostly just to see where all the rats hang out ( Lower East Side ) ! I think you hit the nail on the head by saving money on activities . There is so much to do in the city without having to pay very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Michael and the Tonight Show are free if you do n't  mind waiting in line ! And you never know what you may score also , I happened to stand in line to go see The View one morning and managed to get into their Favorite Things Show ! So I went home with quite the little bag of swag . Yes NYC is expensive , but its also manageable if you are smart ! 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> HAHAHA , I forgot about the rat website ! I wonder if there 's a cockroach one too ? <p> Great point about all the free shows here ! I feel like we can almost justify the high cost of living with all the free activities available to us . NYC seems to have some amazing opportunities , no matter who you are whether its scoring tickets to one of these shows , or pursuing your dream job . <p> Ryan Zieman <p> First thing , I love the picture of you in front of the Goofy mural . I 'm a huge fan lol . Second , thanks for such an informative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and I have mixed feelings about living in NYC . The rent prices are just something I cant wrap my head around especially after living in another amazing city like Chicago for much less . Btw I 'm missing TJs so badly here in Madrid , but I guess I 'll just compensate with cheap vino and jam+n. 205745 @qwx1065745 <p> Oh I could SO take the cheap vino if I could . Definitely take advantage of that as much as you can ! : D <p> If living in NYC is your dream I say go for it ! I 'm not one to impose limits on myself , but if you tell yourself that your time in NYC is for the short-term , it makes it a little more justifiable , you know ? cause its not like you 'll ALWAYS be paying this high rent . You could also get by spending like $700/month on rent in a neighborhood like Bushwick ( aka where the Glee cast lived when they moved to NYC for college OH YEAH I just referenced that show ! ) . <p> Jason MacKenzie <p> Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move within the next year . This was incredibly helpful ! ! <p> Great post ! Clearly housing costs is the highest monthly expense for anyone planning to live in the top cities in the US , but there are obviously other saving techniques that frugal New Yorkers use . You did a very good job listing majority of them I might just add given booming transportation options it makes sense to signup for Uber , Lyft , Via they all often offer cheap alternatives to MTA ( often they have coupons or free riding options ) . Additionally , saving on utility bills can be another cost cutting that one might consider . The first is obviously the phone go with cheap alternatives to Verizon or ATT if monthly phone usage is not significant . Look at Ting or Republic Wireless , for example . On energy front one can choose electricity supplier other than ConEd . Companies like powersetter.com or electricrate.com provide pretty good overview of various options and allow switching to other cheaper plans . With cable there are bunch of companies ( think Netflix or Hulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NYC for a long time and thought I 'd complement your list : ) <p> Thanks Ed your tips are excellent , thank you for sharing ! : ) One of these days I 'll have to update this post ! <p> Uber Pool and Lyft did n't  really take off til after I left the city , but I 've heard they are relatively cheap and often worth taking instead of the subway . I also never even considered phone options ( was always on the family plan ! ) great idea there . 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793047 @7793047/ <h> Yarra Valley Wine Tour : A Melbourne Must-Do <p> Disclaimer : This is a review of a Yarra Valley wine tour from the perspective of a wine enthusiast and avid photographer . As such , the focus is on the overall wine tasting experience , with particular attention to the aesthetics of the vineyards and winery grounds ( i.e. less wine snobbery and more pretty pictures ) . <p> Right . Just wanted to clear up that I 'm not a wine snob , and did not absorb the finer details of all the wines we tasted . I wont be dazzling you with my newfound knowledge of how these wines are made or how to describe the various tastes . With the exception of coffee , my palette remains horribly unrefined . <p> Instead , I 'm going to show you how unbelievably beautiful the Yarra Valley region is . If you 're in Melbourne , you absolutely must devote a day to touring the valley and tasting the local wines . The Yarra Valley , like Margaret River and Tasmania , produces cool climate wines . Its best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of varietals here . <p> Wine aside , the scenery around the Yarra Valley is just stunning . Many of the wineries have built some impressive buildings in which to enjoy some wine or a meal some of which are equipped with a 5 star view . <p> With all the landscapes , architecture , and culinary delights , a Yarra Valley wine tour is the perfect way to spend a day outside of Melbourne . Heres what our day out wine tasting with Vinetrekker looked like : <h> Coldstream Hills <p> We warmed up our wine taste buds at Coldstream Hills , a rather simple winery that admittedly did n't  inspire love at first sight . Our lackluster setting soon became a non-issue as we were served our most generous tasting of the day I believe it was about 9 wines in total , more than half of which were Chardonnays . Coldstream has an interesting sparkling Pinot Noir Chardonnay . I 'd never heard of blending white and red , but in this case it was quite tasty ( and the color is more white than red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more and more akin to the heart-eyed emoji . Aside from coffee , this just might be the best way to start the day ! <p> ( Speaking of Chard , I was quickly called out for referring to it as that apparently that 's slang for crystal meth in Australia . Whoops ! Guess I shouldnt be proclaiming my love for Chard around these parts ! ) <h> Medhurst Wines <p> It may have been the glorious light that spilled in through the floor-to-ceiling windows that made me completely adore Medhurst Wines . Or the enticing sweet treats that greeted us by the kitchen door as we walked in . Or the fabulous reclining chairs tempting us just outside , overlooking the hills . <p> Mostly , I enjoyed the hell out of our Medhurst tasting because this winery seemed more Mom &amp; Poppy than any other I 've visited in the Yarra . It felt like we were walking into a family home rather than a corporate facility . <p> App Guy let me in on the joy that is the Australian Vanilla Slice and snagged one for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly enjoyed during holidays and special occasions here . Judging from how quick we cleared ( ahem , vacuumed ) the plate , I reckon I 'm a fan of this Aussie treat . <h> Domaine Chandon <p> I was pretty pumped to get back to Domaine Chandon . Its probably the most popular ( and commercial ) winery in the Yarra Valley , and hence best enjoyed in the morning before the crowds file in . <p> Crowds or not , its 100% worth it to visit this place . It felt like we were roaming a fancy European estate as we strolled down majestic hallways with super tall ceilings . Paul gave us a tour of the facility , from grape processing to the riddling room . In lieu of a tasting , we were each offered a glass of one of their sparkling wines ( they had 4 kinds to choose from ) . <p> We could have opted for a $5 tasting on top of that , but more than anything I just wanted to sit outside with my glass of sparkling and stare out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini photoshoot , OBVIOUSLY . <h> Yering Station <p> Yering Station has some of the most impressive grounds of any winery in Yarra Valley . Its restaurant building is modern , sleek , and looks out onto the vineyards from the dining area . Yeah , I definitely did n't  mind having lunch here ! <p> For a self-proclaimed non-foodie , its probably not too surprising that this was the fanciest menu Ive ever had to order from . I did n't  even know what about 1/4 of the listed items were , but in the name of adventure I cast my hesitations aside and ordered the rockling ( a fish ) , served with celeriac ash , mussels , fermented garlic , and pink peppercorn hollandaise . WOWZER . <p> Lunch was accompanied with a glass of wine and a cup of coffee . This was a much easier choice for me : Chardonnay and a flat white , duh ! <p> Yerings cellar door is located in a different building , one that instantly made me think *rustic chic wedding venue* . Exposed brick walls and wooden everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wine tasting . At this point I was ready to wine-down , but I tried my best to keep up ! <h> De Bortoli Wines <p> Fast approaching the point of exhaustion , we rolled into our last vineyard for the day and I was kinda wishing I was horizontal . A generous offering of cheeses helped spark me back to life for the final tasting at De Bortoli Wines . Prosecco and dessert wine are what they do really well here . <p> I do n't  understand why or how , but pairing certain cheeses with certain wines can make the wine taste so much better than when its imbibed on its own . Paul knew which cheese went best with which wine , and made sure we all tried the right cheese with each wine tasting . App Guy and I may have sampled more cheese than wine here , but can you blame us ? We were two glasses and , like , 20+ tastings in at this point . I never said I was in it to win it ! <p> We snuck out towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save for one guy meditating on the hill , we had it all to ourselves . Photo shoot part 2 , you say ? Well ok ! <p> Man , what an awesome experience . There are plenty of tour operators that run from the city to the valley so that you can safely imbibe without having to drive , but I 'd go with Vinetrekker again without question .

@@118793049 @7793049/ <h> My Super-Fun Melbourne Street Art Class <p> Filed under **35;361;TOOLONG Things That Exist in Melbourne ( of which there are MANY , god bless this city ) : a hands-on street art class ! <p> I had no idea this was a thing until App Guy gifted me with a voucher for Christmas . The Footscray Community Arts Centre is a virtually unknown treasure trove of affordable creative classes offered to the Melbourne community . They have a Can Control class for kids that regularly fills up , but only recently did they start offering a similar class for adults . <p> I 'd actually been meaning to explore Footscray anyway , The view from the Arts Centre is meant to be one of the best in Melbourne , facing the Marybyrnong River and city skyline . And there 's a cafe nearby called Rudimentary that 's housed in some old shipping containers , which had been on my Coffee To Try list . So really , the stage was set for a thoroughly awesome Footscray excursion . <p> View from Footscray Community Arts Centre . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions across two consecutive Saturdays . I was thinking that seemed like an awful long time to spend in an art class , but it wound up being pretty ideal . <p> On Day 1 , our teacher a local street artist who goes by the name Short ( real name Antonia ) took us on a tour of the neighborhood and provided some commentary on the various street art pieces we passed by . I 've done countless of my own street art crawls , but it was so good to have it accompanied by some insight into how Melbourne 's street art culture works . We learned that it 's a very male-dominated culture , with guys and girls being part of separate crews ' , and girls having to fight to earn respect on the walls . If you have n't earned it , expect your street art to get tagged and painted over . <p> I found it fascinating to learn about some of the better-known street artists in town : how some of them are straight-up asshats , how a few have risen to fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to spot their pieces around the city ( some of them have pretty defining styles or tags ) . I did n't realize that street art had such a distinct community you 'd never even know about it unless you or someone you knew was a part of it . Before this class , I really only thought about the art I spotted on city streets not so much about the people or politics behind it . <p> We also learned about different types of street art . The simple tags ( or signatures ) are used to sign a piece or deface someone elses work , and it 's ideal if you can connect all the letters without having to lift the can ( kind of like writing in cursive ) . Throw-ups are those larger pieces that tend to be big boxed letters spelling out an artist 's name . I always thought they were kind of ugly and effortless , but Short explained that it actually takes a long time to master them and , if done well , can be impressive works of art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and browsed some street art magazines for inspiration . Short shared her portfolio with us and I got all excited when I recognized one of her pieces from around the city . Shes been doing this for 5 years now , which is damn impressive considering how difficult it is for women to break into this male-dominated community . <p> We popped back outside to start playing with the cans , first learning about the different nibs ( or tips ) that fit atop the cans . Some nibs give you a finer , more precise line , while others spray more thick . I did n't  quite understand which nibs to use when , but since we were just messing around to get a feel for them I randomly grabbed one and got to spraying . <p> My pathetic first attempt at street art . <p> Um , guys ? Street art is NOT easy . In fact , its way more difficult than you probably think . Not that I thought I could pick up a can for the first time and brand myself the Picasso of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't look like the work of a 5 year old . <p> Apparently others did n't struggle with it as much as I did . I was all sorts of mesmerized by my fellow classmate slash street art prodigy 's first piece . I love how he did n't restrict himself to just the one wall , but instead let his art expand onto the ground and the side panel . <p> While I ended Day 1 feeling largely like a big fat failure , I took with me a strategy to carry into Day 2 : Start out with an idea or concept of what you want to create ( preferably a sketch ) , but let the art flow out of you however it may when it comes time to take the can to the wall . In other words , the opposite of what I did on Day 1 , where I had no idea what I wanted to make and felt almost paralyzed by my wall space . <p> On Day 2 , Short encouraged us to come with photos of street art pieces we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by sketching . Lord knows I 've got an enormous collection of street art photos to call on , but I got so overwhelmed looking at them and thought for sure they all looked way too intricate for me to do any sort of justice to . I felt so helpless ! <p> But then once we established our mutual love for cats , she declared we 'd be working on a collaborative cat mural outside . I know art is supposed to more free form , but as a beginner it really helped to have a clear focus , even if it was given to me . Cats ! I know cats ! I can draw a kitty face , sure . <p> I nearly painted the heart-eyed cat emoji ! <p> Drawing a stupid-simple cat face is easy enough , but translating that into a colorful mural was absolutely daunting . Maybe it 's just me , but I need to feel comfortable with a skill before I 'm ready to apply it . Otherwise I 'm hyperfocused on the mechanics and cant get into the creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? <p> But okay , I only had 3 hours to create my portion of the cat mural I did n't have the luxury of mastering can control before applying it to street art . So I took my sweet time painting my kitty , baby step by baby step . The outline was pretty easy since I had my sketch , but when it came time to paint the cat 's facial features I froze . How should I know what looks good ? I started out with a basic set of eyes , then grew them out to be rather large . That 's the thing with street art ( and art in general ) : it does n't have to be perfect or exact the first time . You try one thing , it does n't quite work , so you try something else . Thinking about the whole thing as a process rather than a singular task helped me work through it . It 's not an act of translating sketch to mural it 's more like translating an idea from mental to physical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> here 's how my pink cat ended up : <p> My first real piece of street art ! <p> I was SO , SO HAPPY with how my street art kitty turned out . I cant believe how much I improved after the first class ! I did n't  have time to work on shadows or my tag , but I did practice cutbacks plenty : that 's where you go back and forth between adjacent colors , painting over the other color if it mistakenly went on the color you 're using , and vice versa until you have clear lines or sections of color . <p> If there were a Day 3 to the class , I 'd want to work on producing lines of different thicknesses . I know its affected by which nib you use , the pressure you apply to it , and the angle at which you spray , but I have zero idea how . That 's why my cat has no whiskers because I knew I 'd mess up the skinny lines , ruin the piece , and not have time to fix it ! Ah well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue cat and spider ; other student did politics , orange face , and vom-blob . <p> Overall , I had a total blast at my Melbourne street art class .

@@118793050 @7793050/ <h> North Brooklyn Coffee Shop Roundup <p> I 've spent the entirety of my near-7 years in NYC living in the Williamsburg , Brooklyn area . As a self-proclaimed coffee snob , I can say with assurance that I 've carefully sampled this neighborhood 's coffee . And by that , I mean I 've poured tens of hundreds of dollars into caffeinating my veins and conducting ongoing research to find the best coffee in North Brooklyn . God , imagine the trips I could have taken with that money . ( Nevermind , do n't ) . <p> I feel zero guilt over this arguably frivolous expenditure . North Brooklyn 's plentiful cafes are what have gotten me through each miserable winter in New York . I 've derived so much joy out of discovering each new third wave coffee shop that 's opened up over recent years in Williamsburg and Greenpoint . Some I find excellent for spending a weekend afternoon getting work done , and others better suited for enjoying a delicious midday cup of whatever their specialty is . <p> If you find yourself living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide to finding the best coffee in North Brooklyn <h> Best Latte <h> Crema BK ( 182 Driggs Ave , Greenpoint ) <p> This tiny shop is new , Asian-owned , and makes the best latte in the boonies of Greenpoint ( aka east of McGuiness Blvd ) . It 's not meant to be a working coffee shop , but you can usually grab a spot at one of its few tables and break out your laptop . I 'd spend more time here if it had a bathroom ! Regardless , Crema makes a mean latte brewed from Toby 's Estate beans it 's a must try ! <h> Gim me ! Coffee ( 107 Roebling St &amp; 495 Lorimer St , Williamsburg ) <p> Gim me was my jam back in my Cornell days , when I used to grab a cup at their on-campus coffee cart en route to the library . I was thrilled to find they had multiple shops in NYC when I moved here post-graduation . I 've since decided that Gimme 's lattes ( including iced lattes ) are among the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Williamsburg locations is meant to be a workspace but their lattes are too good not to sample ! <h> Best Pour Over <h> Cafe Grumpy ( 193 Meserole Ave , Greenpoint ) <p> Grumpy has held a solid spot on my go-to coffee shop list since , quite literally , my first week of living in NYC ( i.e. early 2008 ) . For years it was my favorite place to hole up on weekends with my laptop and its 1/2 price refills . Then the show Girls ' went and blew it up and it 's a bit more popular now as a result . I still hang out here on occasion , but now I maintain that the best thing about Cafe Grumpy is its pour over . Some blends are pricier than others ( ahem , $10 Clover coffee ) , but all of their options are delicious . <h> Toby 's Estate Coffee ( 125 N 6th St , Williamsburg ) <p> I adore Toby 's because it 's Australian , it 's hip , and it has killer pour overs . Their Williamsburg shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sceney for my liking . Better to drop in , order a pour over , then take it to the nearby waterfront . ( Bonus : In true Aussie style , they offer the flat white . TRY THIS TOO ! ) . <h> Best Regular Coffee <h> Cafe Grumpy ( 193 Meserole Ave , Greenpoint ) <p> In addition to great pour overs , Grumpy has always had delicious brewed coffee . However , the price increase on their regular cup in recent years no longer justifies it , in my mind . For an extra 25 cents , you can get a freshly pulled Americano of the same size . So my strategy is : if I only want one cup , I get an Americano or a pour over ; if I want 2 cups , I get the regular brewed coffee because the second cup is 1/2 price . <h> Black Brick ( 300 Bedford Ave , South Williamsburg ) <p> This cafe hits all the right spots for me : it 's got a cozy hipsteresque workspace , friendly and unpretentious baristas , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snob cheap AND delicious cups of coffee . I love that I can pay $2 for a really great cup of french press and not feel like I skimped on my joe . <p> Cafe Grumpy has really cool collaged tables , too ! <h> Best Iced Coffee <h> Blue Bottle ( 160 Berry St , Williamsburg ) <p> I much prefer hot to cold brews , but once in awhile I crave Blue Bottle 's New Orleans iced coffee . Cold brewed with chicory , sweetened with cane sugar , and blended with whole milk this is one distinct coffee drink . Best to enjoy its subtle sweetness as-is without adding any additional sugar or milk . <p> Blue Bottle has been a staple on the San Francisco coffee scene for years , only having made it to NYC relatively recently . Their New Orleans cold brew is such a hit that it 's now sold in small milk cartons at all shop locations , as well as in Whole Foods stores across California . Believe the hype , fellow coffee snobs : Blue Bottle 's New Orleans iced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pit ( 135 Woodpoint Rd , East Williamsburg ) <p> This tiny shop is quite unfortunately located near nothing of interest , so I imagine business is not quite as booming as it would be , were it stationed elsewhere . And that 's a shame because they 've got some of the best iced coffee around . Tar Pit employs the Kyoto slow drip method to craft their iced coffee admittedly , I have no idea what exactly this entails , but it 's said to be quite time-intensive and results in a very unique taste . <p> Blue Bottle coffee on the Williamsburg waterfront <h> Best Flavored Latte <h> Bedford Baking Studio ( 347 Bedford Ave , South Williamsburg ) <p> BBS is the coziest , most unpretentious little cafe you could hope to find in hipster Williamsburg . On the rare occasion I 'm not looking to camp out with my laptop somewhere , I like to stop by Bedford Baking Studio , order a lavender latte with almond milk , and enjoy my bowl-sized mug on the couch . <h> Upright Coffee ( 860 Manhattan Ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly not meant for lingering , as it only has a couple of bar seats at its patrons ' disposal . Even if you ca n't sit , it 's worth ordering either a lavender latte or vanilla latte to go . Both are made from flavored syrups infused in-house and are absolutely delicious . <p> Lavender latte from Upright <h> Best Workspace <h> El Beit ( 158 Bedford Ave , Williamsburg ) <p> I like this coffee shop because it 's open late , houses a spacious backyard patio , and has open air seating facing the Bedford Avenue sidewalk in warmer months . Coupled with a prime location near the Bedford subway stop , it 's my preferred place to meet my wedding photography clients after work . <h> Budin ( 114 Greenpoint Ave , Greenpoint ) <p> I am borderline obsessed with this unique new Nordic coffee shop in Greenpoint . Budin has a very modern feel with its white walls , wooden furniture , wide open space , and light streaming in from both the front and back windows . It 's so refreshing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to find a place to sit with your laptop a rarity in this city . If you need a break from work , you can peruse the selection of Nordic magazines and books , browse the Nordic goods shop in the back , or sit outside on the ( non-Nordic ) patio . And if you find yourself here after dark , Budin serves wine and beer til 12/1am . You could conceivably spend your entire day hanging out here and it would be glorious . <p> Oh , and the coffee ? They have a $10 licorice latte , sourced from international ingredients and priced accordingly . ( Fun fact , Icelanders LOVE licorice ) . If licorice ai n't  your thing , their regular latte is pretty ace and less obscenely priced . They also serve pour over cups made from beans shipped from you guessed it ! Iceland , Norway , and Sweden . <h> Propeller Coffee ( 984 Manhattan Ave , Greenpoint ) <p> So , Propeller is stationed way up north in Greenpoint and does not have the best coffee around . BUT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting work done . I always try to grab a seat in the little alcove in the back , a separate partially-open room with a few old school desks and chairs inside . It feels more like hanging out in someone 's living room than in the back of a coffee shop . <h> What 's your favorite North Brooklyn coffee shop ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I 'd strategically do my weekly shopping at Bi-Lo in the nearby Broadway Shopping Centre towards the end of the day , when breads and produce were marked down by 50% . Consequently , kangaroo sausages became my jam in no time : chewy and flavorful like steak , but considerably more affordable and exotic . <p> Sappho Books : one of the things I miss the most from Sydney <p> But my most contented moments during my time in Sydney were spent tucked into some reading and a cappuccino at Sappho Books , a used bookstore and cafe on Glebe Point Road .

@@118793074 @7793074/ <h> Sydney Harbour Walk : Watsons Bay &amp; South Head <p> They say Sydney is the city with the best walking tracks . And after tackling most of those along Sydney Harbour myself , I have absolutely zero objections to that claim . <p> Since I lived in Bondi for two months , I 'm obviously partial to the famous Bondi to Coogee coastal walk . I think my favorite Sydney Harbour walk , though , is the one that wraps around Watsons Bay from South Head . It 's the best of Sydney condensed into one glorious walking track : from the rugged ocean cliffs of Gap Bluff to the secluded harbour beaches and the magnificently framed views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House along the way . Best of all , it 's not at all crowded ! <p> If you 're an avid walker and have a full sunny day at your disposal , I can think of few better outdoor adventures in Sydney than walking this Watsons Bay/South Head trail , then continuing on through ritzy Vaucluse and ambling along the Hermitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part 2 for a future post ! ) . It 's totally worth the inevitable sunburn and sore feet ! <p> In a counter-clockwise direction , here 's how the walk unfolds <h> Gap Park <p> Jump off the bus at Gap Park and begin the walk along the cliff edge toward the tip of South Head . I love this part of the walk because on one side you 've got the rugged coast , then when you turn your head and look the other way you see some of the best views of Sydney . I mean HOW AMAZING IS THIS ? ! ! <h> 1 . The Gap Bluff <p> Not too far down the path you 'll reach another park entrance , which happens to be stationed near an exceptional view of The Gap . It 's hard not to stand here for awhile captivated by the crashing waves just below . <p> From The Gap , the path continues uphill into Sydney Harbour National Park . The views up here are just magnificent ! <h> South Head Heritage Trail <p> If you can pry yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk beckons . Getting to the start of South Head Heritage Trail can be a little tricky if the path onwards is closed off ( as it was the last time I was there ) . In that case , you can just head back to the main road and enter Gap Bluff Centre , walk through the parking lot , and join the path from there . Either way , you 'll hit the South Head Heritage Trail smack in the middle , right around the navy base . <p> The South Head Heritage Trail spans 1.7km along Watsons Bay from Hornby Lighthouse ( at South Head ) down to Camp Cove ( just north of Watsons Bay beach ) . <h> 2 . Hornby Lighthouse <p> At the north end of the trail is the lighthouse loop , which takes you on a tour past the Hornby Lighthouse and some historic remnants ( i.e. old forts ) . Definitely check out the old hut right by the lighthouse it 's more or less the foundation for a tiny building , and it looks straight out at North Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot to relax in the shade of the house while having a snack or lunch . <p> Continuing along the trail approaching Watson 's Bay , you 'll pass by a couple of Sydney 's best secluded beaches <h> 3 . Lady Bay <p> Lady Bay is Sydney 's best nude beach . And by best , I mean most beautiful and most popular . If you approach the stairway leading down to the beach , you can catch a glimpse of the folks who frequent this beach ( almost all of which are creepy middle-aged men ) . But know that they can see from below when you gawk at them and then run away giggling ( as basically all tourists do ) . <p> If descending to a plot of sand swarming with naked older men sounds intimidating , there 's an alternate path you can take down that 's a bit more private . Head down the Heritage Trail to the right of the beach ( toward the lighthouse ) and take the footpath through the woods . Getting down to the beach requires some rock scrambling/rappelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to a rocky area well fit for laying out or lounging in the rock pools at low tide . Then if you dare , you can just walk over to the main beach when the tide is low enough . <p> Really though , do n't let the naked men or rappelling deter you from checking out Lady Bay it 's one of the best beaches in Sydney ! <h> 4 . Camp Cove <p> Camp Cove is more of a family beach , but it 's super pretty ! In bright sun , the sand looks orange and the water reflects a deep turquoise . Throw in some good diving and snorkelling just offshore and a lovely view of the city skyline and BAM , another fantastic Sydney beach . <p> Be sure to walk uphill on either side of the beach to catch a view of it from above . Both sides happen to be great spots for hanging out as well , you know , in case you 're sick of laying in the sand or need to cool off in the shade . <h> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a 5 minute walk down the street to Watsons Bay beach , where you can dine alfresco on fish and chips at Doyle 's on the Beach or catch a ferry back to the city .

As we approached , we realized the mist was being blown back upwards from a waterfall that went over the cliff edge . A rainbow flickered in and out of view as we continued to circle it counterclockwise . Upon reaching the edge , we could see the massive waves below churning and crashing into the rock just beneath the waterfall , whose water both thundered down into the sea and got swept back up onto the land . <p> We sat in near-silence right here , marveling at all the things the water was doing on the natural stage before us : waves forming and breaking , water falling and blowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Fire <p> Represents the energetic , forceful , moving things in the world .

In this case , I was traveling to the Philippines in the tail end of the monsoon season and I knew that bad weather would be a very likely possibility . I did n't  want to risk scheduling just a few days for El Nido , a top bucket list item , only to have them all rained out if the weather was n't cooperative . <p> And thank goodness I did n't  risk it ! I 'd heard that El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived , so I mentally prepared for the worst when I finally touched down there . The heavy rain parade continued throughout most of my stay , though thankfully we had 2 semi-sunny days on which to do our island boat tours . <p> But what even is there to do in El Nido when it rains ? Not much , my friends this is a place for beach bumming and island hopping . El Nido is best enjoyed on a sunny day , and that 's a fact . <p> That said , I booked some fun dives with Deep Blue Seafari one day because all I wanted to do was get out into the archipelago , and it was a GREAT call . It rained off and on while we were out there , but who really cares when you 're underwater , right ? Its a totally different world down there . <p> Though nobody really travels to El Nido specifically for the diving ( at least I certainly did n't  ) , I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my dives there . <p> I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification , but one of the people in the group of 3 friends I was placed with only had their Open Water which meant as a group we could dive to a maximum of 18m deep . I did n't  really mind though because the dive sites we visited had plenty to see in shallow waters . <p> First up : Helicopter Reef . Perhaps not surprisingly , this dive site is all about the reef . We stayed fairly shallow and were able to spot several cool fish amongst it , including lionfish , electric clams , trumpet fish , and a blue spotted sting ray . <p> Next , we headed further out to Twin Rocks . Its meant to be one of the best ( or at least most popular ) dive sites at El Nido , but I found it the most underwhelming of the 3 we hit .

Maybe not if you have limited time and awesome weather at your disposal , but if you find yourself with extra time and/or rainy days while you 're there , go for it . <p> If diving is high on your Philippines to-do list , head to Coron or Malapascua instead that 's where the best diving- is ! <p> Lastly , all photos and videos in this post were taken by me with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver .

@@118793078 @7793078/ <h> A Snowshoeing Adventure From NYC ! <p> This winter , I 'm on a crusade to override my tendency to go into hibernation mode for 4 months . Instead of succumbing to winter and the miserable weather it brings , I 'm trying to play nice with it . So far Ive gone upstate to see the Great Jack-O-Lantern Blaze in November , enjoyed Christmas season in NYC in December , organized a pot luck dinner with friends , went to my first trampolining class in January , and now a snowshoeing trip upstate in February ! <p> I had it in my mind that snowshoeing would make for a great workout , and would be fairly easy to pick up at first attempt . More importantly , it would be something NEW to try . <h> Getting to Fahnestock Winter Park <p> Cost-wise , there is n't must benefit to taking the train vs. renting a car to get to Fahnestock . But what makes the train ride worth it is the scenic river views all along the way . My gaze was permanently fixed at the Hudson and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I claim to hate snow , it sure looked pretty on the river . <p> We called for a cab as our train arrived in Cold Spring and were told itd be about 20 minutes . 20 minutes soon turned into well over an hour , which was more amusing than it was frustrating . I wrote it off as small town charm and we killed the time by hanging out in a snowy park on the river , watching freight trains roll by and listening to gentle ice cracks in the distance . We relished this quiet time away from the city noise . <h> At Fahnestock Winter Park <p> Fahnestock Winter Park is part of Fahnestock State Park , which functions as a campground and hiking mecca during warmer months . As such , there is no snowboarding or downhill skiing here instead , during snowy winter months , walking trails are groomed and transformed into snowshoeing and cross country skiing trails . <p> Fahnestock has 2 dedicated snowshoeing trails . With zero snowshoeing experience to our names , we opted to try the easier trail first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exceptionally easy like , bunny trail easy . That did n't  stop me from enjoying the experience , though we did n't  see anyone else on the trail , and it was just so peaceful and calm out there . At times the trail had us crossing the street , or led to views of parking lots below , a quick reminder that we werent too deep in the wilderness . <p> We stopped for lunch at the lodge , then set out again for round 2 this time attempting the more difficult snowshoeing trail . We did n't  quite have time to make it through the whole trail , but we did make it up to the lake viewpoint : <p> The more difficult snowshoeing trail runs partially along the Appalachian Trail , which we got a quick taste of on our little jaunt . It definitely was more difficult than the other trail , but I did n't  find it tiring at all even with the steady uphill climb . The hardest part for me was the footwork required on narrower parts of the trail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy feet a few times , but falling on snow was pretty painless . <p> This trail felt significantly more rugged and scenic like we were actually in the wilderness , not in a well-kept park . I wish wed had time to complete the whole thing , but we had to make sure we returned our rental gear by a certain time . <p> In all , I had a blast not only snowshoeing , but escaping New York City for a day . I 'd love to snowshoe again , maybe even try cross country skiing , but preferably someplace more aesthetically gratifying ( hello , western US and/or Canada ! ) . <h> Snowshoeing Tips <p> I had been wondering a few things before my first time snowshoeing , so I thought I 'd share my findings with others contemplating trying it out : <p> What is snowshoeing actually like ? Walking or trekking , but with added traction on your feet which makes it easier and faster to negotiate snowy hills . <p> How hard is it ? Not hard at all ! If you can walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle the parts of the trail that were very narrow and unflat , simply because it was easier to trip over my snowshoes ( yes , I did this on more than one occasion ) . <p> What should I wear ? LAYERS . Layers for days ! Do n't  worry so much about pants your legs should warm up fairly quickly . I was perfectly warm in just fleece leggings . As for the top half , I 'd recommend a sweat-wicking bottom layer , a thin warm-weather pullover ( like the kind you 'd run or work out in ) , and a thin outer layer ( preferably water-resistant ) . Wearing one big winter coat is not a good idea because you 'll sweat like mad . FYI it was in the 20s when I snowshoed in this getup . <p> What kind of shoes ? Anything water resistant . Regular hiking boots would work fine , but youd want to wear a pair or two of wool socks to keep your feet warm . I opted to wear my warm and fuzzy snow boots , which worked very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time I found I did n't  need them , but they were useful to help stay balanced on hills or narrow parts of the trail . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of February 2014 It is well worth renting a car for a day to get to Fahnestock Winter Park . But if you 're frugal and/or adventurous , you can reach Fahnestock Winter Park from NYC via public transport and taxi : <p> Train : Take a Metro North Hudson line train from Grand Central to Cold Spring . Trains leave every hour , take about 1h20m , and cost $26.50 roundtrip . <p> Taxi : Its a good idea to have the phone numbers of a few cab drivers before arriving , and call to be picked up shortly before arriving in Cold Spring . A cab ride takes 15-20 minutes and costs $25 each way . <p> You can rent snowshoes and skis ( with poles ) at the park : its $15 for an all-day rental , plus $10 for a trail pass . <p> In terms of food , there are some cute cafes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are ideal for grabbing coffee and breakfast before hitting the trails . There 's also a cafe at Fahnestock that sells snacks , hot drinks , and lunch ( sandwiches and chili at $5 a pop ) . <p> In all , 2 people can expect to spend about $80 each on this snowshoeing excursion and closer to $100 if renting a Zipcar. 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I had a feeling beforehand that I 'd enjoy it , and sure enough it was the only place I wish I 'd had more time in . <p> My perfect day in Udaipur began with a tour of the City Palace , continued with a painting lesson , and ended with dinner at a gluten-free/vegan Indian restaurant . <h> Udaipur City Palace <p> On the morning of my first day in Udaipur , I really had no idea what to do aside from tour the City Palace . My hotel was about 5 minutes away from the back entrance , so it just made sense to start off there . <p> Upon entering the gate , I made a beeline for the sidewalk that wound around the lake and up to the palace ( you know me , I 'm a sucker for good views ) . Talk about good views this one was particularly fetching , with the fancy-schmancy Lake Palace and City Palace sandwiching the town islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from several angles , from rooftops , bridges , and cable cars , during my two days here . <p> The City Palace itself is the top attraction in Udaipur with good reason . I often eschew things that are too touristy , but this one is worth seeing . For a mere 275 rupees ( 5 USD ) , you can embark on a tour of the palace . The path is clearly marked and takes you all through the palace , up and down stairs , through narrow corridors , past ridiculously ornate sitting rooms and bedrooms , and to open courtyards . It 's impossible to get lost , and you 're free to wander through at your own pace . <h> Silk Painting Lesson in Udaipur <p> After the City Palace , my wanderings led me across the foot bridge to a part of town with narrow streets that felt distinctively less touristic . I was rarely hassled , which allowed me to observe and photograph the locals around the neighborhood : <p> I 'd have been perfectly content frolicking around here all day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of a silk painting lesson . There 's no shortage of art schools in Udaipur that teach you how to do a silk painting as they did during the Mewar Empire , so odds are you 'll stumble across many as you make your way through town . <p> I took painting lessons from Locky you can easily find his studio by crossing the footbridge , turning right onto the main street , and walking straight for a few minutes until the road veers slightly to the left . At a mere 50 rupees ( .92 USD ) per hour + 150 rupees ( 2.75 USD ) flat rate for materials , his lessons are extremely affordable . It did n't feel like I was enrolled in an art school because I was sitting in this little hole-in-the-wall cavern ' with one other local painter ( and the occasional tourist dropping in for a lesson ) . <p> Locky showed me a bunch of sample paintings and I was immediately drawn to the peacock painting because of all the blue and gold in it . I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replicate . He assured me it 'd only take 4-5 hours to complete , and I was sold . <p> My silk painting lesson was essentially a paint-by-numbers instruction . The first thing I did was sketch out the painting just by looking at the sample . Then Locky would prepare the different colored paints , one by one , and instruct me to paint one section at a time .

@@118793081 @7793081/ <p> As you can imagine , there are hundreds of options when it comes to choosing a trek . I was extremely overwhelmed by them all , but I knew I wanted to go with a reputable company that has good reviews , promotes eco-tourism , goes off the beaten track , and provides trekkers with an authentic local experience . My BFF Google pointed me in the direction of Pooh Eco-Trekking the name alone checked one requirement off my list ! I dug a little deeper and , after checking off all other requirements , decided to pay their office a visit . <p> By happy accident , my visit happened to coincide with the pre-departure meeting of a 3-day trek that was headed out the next morning . I had n't  even made up my mind about which trek I wanted to do , or even if I was going to go with Pooh , but my gut was telling me to join them . Before it even had time to sink in , I was handing over a fistful of baht and being kitted out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I come ! <h> Part 1 : Village Trekking <p> Our adventure began with a leisurely stop at a market outside of town , where our guides stocked up on supplies for the next few days . I snagged myself a bag of peanuts and a cheap poncho , which I SO BADLY wanted to *not* have to use , to keep my umbrella-and-poncho-less streak alive . Who travels Southeast Asia during the wet season without protection from the rain ? This girl ! <p> We took a rather lengthy truck ride to the start of the trek , which was quite a ways from the city , close to the border of Myanmar . I did n't  mind too much because the further away the trek , fewer tourists will be around . <p> At first I was a little let down by our first day of trekking . I just wanted to get out there and walk my ass off through the countryside , but this was more of a casual stroll through farmland and wooded paths , where we would stop every 5 minutes as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then I did the rational thing and reminded myself of where I was and how cool it was to be learning about a foreign place , and I was able to enjoy the trek for what it was . <p> We reached the Poe Karen village by late afternoon and had plenty of time to roam around while dinner was being prepared . The villagers are used to seeing foreigners around , but its only the groups from Pooh Eco-Trekking that pass through . The company is very transparent about the fact that a good chunk of our trip money is put into the villagers hands . I 'm happy to pay a bit more for a trek if it means having a more authentic , immersive experience and supporting the local economy . <p> Families take turns hosting the trekkers . While the other 4 in our group sprawled out in the main room , I got to sleep in the small side room with Mama ! ( pictured below with her pig ) <p> With the unbearable heat and humidity throughout Southeast Asia , its normal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get the bulk of their work done before the midday heat sets in ( case in point : Mama wakes up at 4am to start the days chores ! ) . The day we arrived , most villagers had stopped work for the day and were just hanging out in their huts , drinking and smoking with friends and family . <p> And oh MAN did they smoke ! I 've never been surrounded by so much chain-smoking in my life , but to be fair I tend to avoid such situations . Fun Fact : I loathe the smell of smoke so much that I 'd rather smell vomit ( I think ? ) . This chain-smoking makes sense when you consider how cheap and plentiful tobacco is in these parts , plus the lack of anything better to do . <p> It was worth enduring , though , to be a part of the group : interacting , taking shots of rice wine , laughing , sharing a meal . These Karen folks could n't have been more welcoming and accepting of us into their homes . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed for another one on the way to the jungle . We had walked no more than 15 minutes before stopping here , but spent a good hour just hanging out inside one of the huts . As usual , all the men chain-smoked , and I did my best not to put on my vom-face . However , I DID experience 2 pretty cool things here : <p> Watched someone roast a mole over the fire , then ate a piece of it ( mmm , surprisingly tasty ! ) <p> Learned how to grind and separate rice manually ( typically a womans expertise ) <h> Part 2 : Jungle Trekking <p> Had I known that the jungle portion of our trek would be proper hiking , I 'd have been ok with the leisurely stroll during the village portion of it . It was downhill most of the way to get to the river , where we stopped for a lunch break . I watched in awe as our guides hacked down some bamboo trees and fashioned some cutlery out of them with a machete . Talk about living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river to get to our camp for the night , cris-crossing it constantly to follow the proper path . We were strongly advised to wear our water shoes for this portion of the hike . I 'd borrowed mine from Pooh and they were a smidge too tight , so I wore them without socks . BAD IDEA . My feet got so torn up with the wet rubber shoes rubbing against my heels and toes that I could n't even enjoy this part of the hike . Trekking through a river sounded so much fun in theory , but being in constant pain really takes away from the thrill of it . <p> It started to rain just before we arrived at our camp , but I managed to not have to use my poncho , keeping the streak alive ! Our digs for the night ? A bamboo hut right on the river ! <p> I sat out on the porch watching the rain fall , while the rest of the group helped prep the vegetables for dinner . Before you go on thinking gosh , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was really starting to bother my eyes . Also , there were too many cooks in the kitchen as it was . And besides SOMEONE had to document the cooking ! <p> I do n't  even know what we had for dinner , but it consisted of veggies we 'd brought with us , fish theyd caught in the river , and of course rice : all seasoned and served in bamboo platters , communal-style . How amazing is it that our Thai guides were able to prepare our meals using solely bamboo theyd scraped up along the way ? Much of the food was cooked in bamboo leaves , hung over the fire off of bamboo sticks ; rice was prepared in a pot on the fire . Our scrambled egg breakfast the next day was cooked inside of a bamboo tree segment , then cut open for us to eat the egg . What seemed to crafty and innovative to us is just a way of life for them . <p> Our final day of trekking was entirely uphill , as to be expected . We stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't particularly excited about I mean , Ive seen plenty of caves in my day . I 'd already seen some in Thailand ( at Railay ) , and highly doubted that anything could come close to the awesomeness of the cave at Tunnel Creek in Australia . <p> Hoooooooly sh-t , was I wrong . The Bat Cave in Northern Thailand is an incredible experience . I wish so badly that I had photo evidence to illustrate this claim , but I could n't risk damaging my camera again so it stayed tucked away in my bag . The cave was pitch black as we trudged through the river , our path illuminated by the massive flaming bamboo torches that the guides carried . Knowing that snakes were roaming around the cave was slightly unnerving , but I quickly forgot about them when we saw hundreds of bats flying around near the ceiling of the cave . I could see nothing but the bats , sparks from the torches , and the faces of those right next to me . Amazing does n't  even do justice in describing this experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bat Cave . <p> After that , we continued trekking uphill until we reached the road where we were to be picked up and brought back to Chiang Mai . <p> I highly and enthusiastically recommend Pooh Eco-Trekking for anyone wanting to go trekking in Chiang Mai . If you 're looking for a more touristy trekking experience involving bamboo rafting and elephant rides , look elsewhere ; but if you want to experience an authentic jungle trek and village immersion and get a taste of the REAL Thailand , check out the tours with Pooh .

I do n't  want it to come off as me thinking I 'm some kind of expert , or the next Miss America ! Just wanted to share what helps me stay fit while traveling , in hopes that it might work for you as well : ) <p> I 'd like to pen a new slogan : Travel does the body good . <p> NOT milk , ok ? Milk does NOT do the body good . Dairy wreaks havoc on your insides . Diary in no way contributed to the body in the above photo ( which is mine , in case you were n't sure ) . <p> But travel and adventuring in general has definitely helped shape my body and contribute to my overall health . I am extremely health conscious in my everyday life , but it 's not always possible to maintain the same diet and exercise habits when I 'm on the road traveling . <p> Which is okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't go the gym back home . I do n't have designated days where I *work out* or am physically active . I do n't count calories . I do n't need to carefully structure my diet and exercise regimen because I 've trained myself to automatically *think healthy* EVERY SINGLE DAY , no matter where I am . <p> When traveling , my options for food and exercise are no doubt different from the ones I have back home but I 'm equipped with the right tools to know which ones are best for me . And you can be , too , if you take to heart my tips for diet and exercise while traveling : <h> Food While Traveling : <p> When I travel , I always eat less than I would back home . This is n't a conscious effort on my end , but it IS something I 've noticed and come to accept as one of my adventure travel habits . <p> A few reasons for this : <p> Portion sizes are usually smaller <p> I do n't always have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventuring ! ) <p> I do n't always have the means to eat a proper meal ( e.g. I 'm stuck on a train or plane during mealtime ) <p> I do n't want to spend a lot of money , so I just stick to 2-3 small meals a day <p> I do n't have a fridge/cabinet full of snacks to munch on throughout the day <p> Though I 'm eating less , I ensure that most of what I DO eat is of high quality ( i.e. filling and nutritious ) , which is no different from what I do when I 'm at home . I was following the paleo diet for 10 months before I left for Asia and have carried many of those eating habits to my travels . Some loose guidelines I follow : <p> Avoid dairy mostly because I suspect I 'm now lactose intolerant , but also because dairy is n't good for your insides . ( Though I occasionally make exceptions for especially delicious cheese or ice cream ! ) <p> Avoid anything fried if it 's not healthy at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , why would you have fast food in other countries when you could be sampling authentic food from a local hole-in-the-wall ? <p> Avoid processed foods packaged snacks are convenient when I 'm on the go traveling , but they are in no way healthy for me , nor do they fill me . I 'd rather just eat a bigger , more satisfying meal that 'll last me through the day rather than munch on some unsatisfying chips or cookies . Note : Nuts are one healthy packaged snack minimal ingredients and full of healthy fat and protein ! <p> Minimize sugar intake fresh fruit juices/shakes/smoothies are always good because of the vitamin benefits , provided there 's no added sugar . I will usually try to limit myself to either one smoothie OR one cocktail per day , just so I do n't overdo it on the sugar or spend too much money on beverages . I 'll also allow the occasional splurge on dessert no way would I go to France and not sample a chocolate croissant , or Italy without trying gelato ! <p> Minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't always know how dishes are cooked in other countries , but limiting breads and pastas is a good rule of thumb . <p> Maximize vegetable intake different countries have different ways of preparing their vegetable plates , whether it 's stir fried , curried , or in soup or salad form and the flavor is always different as well , so you can sample all sorts of vegetable dishes while staying healthy , without getting bored of it ! <p> Aim to have protein with every meal eggs , meat , tofu , nuts , etc . Protein is what keeps me full the longest , which is what I want when I 'm on the go . <h> Exercise While Traveling : <p> When I travel , I do not deliberately work out . I 'm of the mindset that the world is my gym . <p> My #1 tip ? Walk everywhere . Just head out into a new city and walk until your feet feel like they 're gon na fall off . Do n't take any taxis or buses you 'll get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice about walking 45 minutes or more when public transport is inconvenient . <p> For slightly more intentional exercise , you could incorporate the following into your daily frolicking : <p> Walk up and down escalators instead of just standing on them <p> Carry your own bags ( aka be a backpacker ) <p> Try out an adventure sport that 's popular in the country you 're in ( e.g. surfing in Bali/Hawaii , hiking in Nepal or Peru , skiing in the Alps ) <p> If you 're vacationing on a beach : do laps in the water , or go for long walks in the sand ( the added resistance gives you an extra boost in the exercise department ) <p> Hike up to viewpoints in whatever city or town you 're in there 's always a good view to be had from above ( and a good hike to that view ! ) <h> Final Remarks <p> To clarify : I care about keeping fit because I care deeply about my health .

@@118793102 @7793102/ <h> 5 Killer Sights Ive Managed To Miss While Traveling <p> Over the course of my 13 years of traveling , I 've oscillated from one end of the travel planning spectrum to the other . I 've meticulously planned trips to the point where every single accommodation and each required train ride was booked months in advance of my arrival ( e.g. Italy 2007 ) ; but then on the flip side , I 've also booked flights at the last minute and flown to a new country with literally nothing planned ( e.g. Indonesia 2015 ) . <p> Mostly I fall somewhere between these two extremes when I travel , determined to find the best balance between planning and spontaneity . I still do n't feel like I 've found this sweet spot , though . I want to plan enough of my trip so that I 'm not wasting precious time upon arrival trying to figure everything out , but not so much that I ca n't be flexible and follow my gut feeling if one day I wake up and decide I really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and spontaneity when you travel ? I need all the advice I can garner ! <p> One thing I 've learned is super helpful is to do as much research as possible before your trip . Be fully informed as to what all your options are at your destination , then decide what to do once you 're there . That way you 've planned out anything that 's a must-do for you , while leaving room to make GOOD spontaneous decisions . <p> I 've missed out on so much good stuff while traveling simply because I had n't done enough research to know about it . Here are 5 noteworthy times where I really blew it and managed to miss on some killer sights and views on my travels : <h> La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona <p> In 2011 , I patted myself on the back for snagging a $200 error fare from NYC to Spain . Then I kinda blew it by committing the classic sin of cramming too much into too short a timespan . <p> Not surprisingly , I do n't remember much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be partially to blame as well ) . But I do recall making a beeline to La Sagrada Familia on my first day in Barcelona , balking at the ridonkulous line outside the door to get in , and resolving to return another day when it was less crowded . <p> I stopped by first thing on my last day in the city and to my complete astonishment , it was CLOSED . Nooooooooo ! Why did n't I think to check the opening hours beforehand ? I was so looking forward to checking out the quirky architecture inside La Sagrada Familia and because I did n't prioritize it , I missed out . Such a bummer ! <p> Lesson learned : Do n't wait til the end of your trip to check off your must-sees and must-dos . <h> Wineglass Bay From Mt . Amos <p> I knew I had to check out Wineglass Bay on my Tasmania road trip , and unlike my Barcelona blunder , I hit it within my first 24 hours on the island . Go Lindsay ! <p> The view I had from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , was that the best view over Wineglass Bay is from atop Mt . Amos , not from the standard Wineglass Bay Lookout . We could barely make out the other bodies of water around Wineglass Bay beach from the lookout , and I remember thinking it did n't *quite* look like the photos I 'd seen of the same scene . <p> Yeah , well that 'd be because I had n't researched Tasmania thoroughly enough to know about the 3 hour return hike up Mt . Amos that rewards with this view : <p> Lesson learned : Do more thorough research before your trip and find out exactly where to go to get the best views and photos . <h> Pink Lake Near Esperance <p> The epic Melbourne to Perth road trip I went on two years ago still stands as the least-planned road trip I 've ever taken though in my defense , I was really just tagging along with another group and did n't want to mess with their non-plans by putting on my bossy pants and demanding we stop here , here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I 'd told them that a bright pink-colored lake existed just a few minutes outside of Esperance , a town we passed through en route to Cape Le Grand National Park ( which by the way was per my request slash puppy dog eyes ) , they would have been very happy to stop to check it out . <p> The worst part is that I actually had some idea of a pink lake being somewhere in that general region , but I had it in my mind that it was way further afield for some reason . Why had n't I bothered to check ? It was literally RIGHT THERE and I had no idea . <h> The Subway at Zion National Park <p> The aforementioned travel blunders were major bummers , but none stung quite like this one . <p> It 's one thing to miss out on cool shit because you were lazy with your trip research ; it 's another thing entirely to miss out on something after exerting a ridiculous amount of effort and time to see it . <p> In the sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos on Flickr of this magical-looking rock crevice in Zion National Park and became absolutely fixated on making it to this exact spot .

So naturally , I thought that I 'd hike for a few hours in the scorching heat through some drab-looking bush and magically arrive at The Subway . <p> Except we got to the supposed trail end and what we saw did n't quite align with the photos I 'd been gushing over . <p> The trail seemed to end here , at the point of most-water and a slew of slippery rocks . Mightily disgruntled , we turned around and headed back out , a wee bit confused as to how we had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to indicate that if we had waded through the water and risked walking on that slippery rock , we 'd have turned the corner and smacked right into it . : : cue copious face-palms : : <p> Lesson learned : Researching all the logistics is great , but do n't forget to look into the details of what to do upon arrival . <h> Kirkjufell &amp; Kirkjufellsfoss in Iceland <p> The thing about Iceland is that , despite being quite tiny , it packs SO MANY natural attractions that no matter how well you research your Iceland trip , you 'll only manage to make it to a small fraction of them . Thus , I do n't feel all that awful about missing some of Iceland 's fantastic landscapes . <p> We crammed loads of amazing sights and experiences into our two weeks there , but the thing I really regret missing is the magnificent Kirkjufellsfoss . We did n't quite have enough time to venture onto the Sn+fellsness peninsula , but if we had we 'd have laid eyes on this stunning waterfall next to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dream ! <p> I 'm not even sure how I could have prevented this epic miss , because believe me when I say that I researched the bejesus out of my Iceland trip . I even went so far as to create an Iceland-inspired Pinterest board ( and you know homegirl ca n't be arsed with Pinterest , like , ever ) . Unlike the other fails I mentioned , I feel like I did the best I could and this one was just not in the cards for us . <p> Lesson learned : Sometimes no matter how much research you do , you can still manage to miss some amazing sights . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Katie Bell <p> My most recent one was missing Kayangan Lake in Coron it was literally what made me want to go to Coron in the first place and I had it in my head that it was on the island that Coron town is on not Coron Island .

I 'd never been abroad before , nor did I ski or snowboard , but this was the first time such an opportunity was so accessible to me . I would n't have to worry much about safety or the logistics since this was a group trip , and the price seemed good to me so I recruited my good friend Jill ( who , like me , neither skiied/snowboarded nor did she even go to Cornell ) and we were off to Europe ! <p> While the rest of the group hit the slopes , we explored Innsbruck ( where we were based in Austria ) and took day trips to Salzburg , St. Moritz ( Switzerland ) , and Venice ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our day trip tour around Salzburg and booked our own instead the Sound of Music tour .

Prancing around on the steps where they sang Do-Re-Mi , seeing the gazebo where they danced in the rain , and standing on the edge of the lake by the familys house pretty much made my life . <p> Sadly I did not uncover any 4+6 prints from the Sound of Music tour , but I liked this one that I took of the Salzburg waterfront at dusk , after wed returned . <p> Needless to say , both my travel skills and photo-taking skills have drastically improved in the past 10 years .

So let me qualify that statement by saying that *I* cant not ) . <p> Its just one of those things where you go in knowing that you 're going to drop a whole lot of money and invest too much time in something thatll be over in an instant . For a whopping 750 rupees ( $13.50 ) and a 2-3 hour train ride from Delhi to a place that in no way inspires more than an afternoons worth of sightseeing , I would have my moment of glory at the Taj Mahal . <p> Let 's fast-forward through the part where my train arrives an hour late ( at around 11pm ) , the handful of rickshaw drivers outside the train station have no idea where my hotel ( homestay ) is and do n't want to take me there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then decides to double it once he realizes how far it is .

Bless the mother for waking up , giving me a room , and serving me a very late dinner upon arrival . <p> And lastly , the part where , the next morning , I set off on what should have been a 10-15 minute walk to the Taj , but end up lost in shocker ! a bad neighborhood , without a clue where I 'm going . Against my better judgment , I agreed to a cycle rickshaw ride to the Taj . Turns out , I would have made it there in under 10 minutes had I kept walking straight . Oh and shocker #2 the rickshaw driver ripped me off . <p> I FINALLY MAKE IT TO THE TAJ MAHAL around 10:30am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm in !

It looks best from a distance , where you can admire the elegance of the entire complex , including those bright blue pools that lead up to it . I wanted nothing more than to stare at the Taj for a few hours and have its image permanently emblazoned in my mind . <p> Unfortunately , the men of India had something else in mind . Whenever I stopped walking to look at the Taj , Indian men would stop and ask me for a photo . They 'd then pose next to me as their friend took our picture together ( usually with a cell phone ) .

Obviously that means all I 'm capable of thinking or talking about these days is travel ( which , let 's be real , is not a far stretch from how I usually am ) . <p> Ive been immersing myself in all sorts of travel blogs this month , mostly by bloggers who are champions of solo travel . Since I 'll be travelling alone as well , their writing has been EXTRA inspiring and has made me even more excited for my trip ! Here are some Southeast Asian adventures I will and wont be embarking on : <h> Things I will NOT be doing in Southeast Asia : <p> As someone who routinely makes a bathroom run every hour , this sounds like my personal hell .

But if you know me , you know that 's not my style . <h> Things I WILL be doing in Southeast Asia : <p> Okay , confession time . I 'm a self-professed health nut and fitness fiend , but somehow I just can not get into yoga . I 'm well aware of its many benefits , so I 'm going to make an effort to embrace yoga while in Bali .

Its essentially a 3-day water fight to usher in the Thai New Year , with the added benefit of cooling you down during what 's just about the hottest time of year in the country . <p> If I 'm making it to Laos at all , its going to be via slow boat . It just seems significantly more comfortable than the 30-hour bus ride , though admittedly I AM wary of the bathroom situation ( or lack thereof ) . <p> OH YEAH , this is happening .

@@118793127 @7793127/ <h> December 2016 Recap : Hawaii , NYC , Connecticut <p> Oh I LOVED December so much ! This month I returned to the US for the first time in two years and it was every bit as magical and wonderful as I 'd hoped it would be . <p> First , I flew from Melbourne to Hawaii on a ridiculously cheap flight I booked back in February and spent 12 days wandering around Oahu and Kauai . Anna joined me for the first week and we shopped and dined around Honolulu , then road tripped and camped around Kauai . Driving duties fell to me , as I was the one accustomed to driving on the right ( and correct ; ) side of the road and I WAS SO NERVOUS about it . I was trying to remember when the last time I drove was and I think it was over 3 years ago when I rented a car for my DIY wine tour in Canada . I 've always been a shaky driver , but after several years of not-driving I had more than a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we worry about , it was for nothing I loved driving again ! I did n't even want to turn in our car at the end cause I wanted to keep on cruising . <p> My last few days in Hawaii were spent hiking the famous Kalalau Trail . I 'm still not over it , that 's how incredible this bucket list item was for me . I highly recommend it to experienced hikers and for less experienced hikers , I recommend getting experienced and then taking this trek on . It 's pretty scary at times , but well worth the terror and effort for the sensational views of the Na Pali Coast and getting to camp at Kalalau Beach . <p> I then foolishly made my way home to Connecticut via two consecutive red eye flights . The first one delivered me to Seattle , where I had 12 hours to kill before the second one . In typical Lindsay fashion , I had pretty casual plans to do some work in a cafe and then spend the afternoon wandering around with my camera . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had descended on Seattle . Walking even just for a couple minutes in 20-degree weather without proper winter layers was extremely painful so much so that I only managed to shuffle from cafe to restaurant to cafe , all within a 2-block radius . I am such a wuss . <p> Christmas vibes in Honolulu . <p> Coming home felt SO GOOD . I wish I 'd had more time to spend in NYC , though I was there for 4 days , but unfortunately spent most of the time catching up on all the work I did n't do the first half of the month while gallivanting around Hawaii . Plus , you know , the cold freeze made me want to stay indoors at basically all times . I got to meet up with a few friends though and spent 2 nights at my old Brooklyn apartment with my old roomie and cat . <p> Mostly I hibernated at my parents ' house in Connecticut , working and hanging out with the family and cats . The whole reason I booked a ticket home in December was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low key tropical Christmases in Australia , I just could n't take a third one . <p> Then on New Years Eve , Jamie and I flew to Cancun for an impromptu sisters trip to the Yucatan Peninsula ! As you do . We were total grannies and stayed in that night trying to stay awake for midnight while the whole town partied all night right outside our window . I swear we made up for it the next day , but that 's not technically December so you wo n't hear about it here ! <h> December 2016 Numbers <p> 1 day in Melbourne , Australia 29 days in USA 12 days in Hawaii 5 days in NYC 12 days in Connecticut 1 day in Mexico <p> Erm , well , I may have splashed out a bit at the end of the year . Expensive things like flights halfway around the world , scenic helicopter tours , and a fancy hotel stay blew my budget to smithereens . I also bought a bunch of stuff when I returned home to either replace items I 've been holding onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheap- prices in the US ( e.g. I finally upgraded from an iPhone 4s to a 6 and bought a refurbished one off Amazon ) . <h> December 2016 Highlights <h> The Kauai Road Trip <p> Road tripping is basically my favorite thing in the world to do , especially on a beautiful island like Kauai . I was completely in my element driving around aimlessly and pitching my tent on the beach every night . I especially loved sleeping in the gorgeous dunes at Polihale Beach , chasing rainbows at Waimea Canyon , and sampling the island 's best smoothie bowls . Full Kauai road trip post coming soon ! <p> Rainbow over Waimea Canyon . <h> Staying At The Luxurious St. Regis Princeville <p> I cashed in a Webjet voucher I had and Anna and I split the cost of a night in the ( painfully expensive ) St. Regis Princeville . We took full advantage of the near-24 hours we had at the hotel , lounging around in bathrobes in our room , indulging in fancy cocktails by the pool , and hot tubbing it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , I fear I might be turning into one of those travelers who loves to stay in luxury hotels . Now that I 've had a taste of 5 star living , I know what I 've been missing . But equally , I love roughing it in a tent . I feel like both make for incredible experiences , while most everything in-between is just sort of lackluster . <h> Hiking The Kalalau Trail <p> This month I achieved more bucket list glory by conquering the Kalalau Trail : supposedly one of the world 's most dangerous ( and beautiful ) hikes . I got really lucky with the weather with zero rain on any of my 4 days on the trail . Even so , it was an absolute mudbath ! My brand-new Merrell hiking boots got completely slathered in mud , turning an irreparable shade of brown . Well worth it for the epic views of the Na Pali Coast , though . <p> And Kalauau Beach , my god , take me back immediately . I 've spent time on an absurd number of beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most peaceful spots I 've enjoyed . Simply MAGICAL . <h> My Return To NYC <p> I honestly have n't missed NYC much at all since I moved away in December 2014 , but I was definitely looking forward to revisiting my old stomping grounds and friends ! <p> As I mentioned , I did n't get to see as many people or do as many New Yorky things as I 'd have liked because I had to be a good girl and catch up on work . The one note-worthy thing I did manage to do was visit One World Observatory definitely recommend for killer views over the city . I also managed to dine at two of my favorite Latin restaurants ( Caracas and Bogota ) , indulge in a Shake Shack burger not once but twice while waiting for my train at Grand Central , and work on my laptop at Toby 's Estate . <h> Reuniting With My Cats <p> It 's been a long two years without the regular presence of a feline friend . Occasionally I was lucky enough to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part I 've been severely deprived . <p> I was absolutely convinced that my old kitty Chibbers would n't remember me . She never paid me that much attention when we lived together anyway . But she greeted me with meows and sniffs and fell back into the old bad habits she had before I left ( like climbing on the counter and knocking down the bins ) . AND she even slept with me ! She almost never used to sleep with me before , so I was absolutely shocked when she opted to stay on the couch with me at night . <p> Chibbers ! <p> My family has always had a constant string of 4-6 cats living in the house at any given time . I 'm not particularly close with any of the current ones since I have n't lived at home in many years , but OMG Bunny is so cute and perfect and all she does is purr and loaf around waiting for someone to turn the bathroom faucet on for her to drink out of . She also slept with me every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with a cat again . If they bring me this much joy , it just seems silly not to adopt one here in Sydney . TBA ! <p> Bunny ! <h> Registering as a Democrat <p> I had to endure the heinous DMV in order to swap my old NY drivers license for a CT license before it expired ( total time spent waiting : 3 hours ) . On the plus side , I ended up with a semi-decent license photo ( nevermind that I was looking UP in it ugh ! ) . <p> As I was paying for it , they asked if I wanted to register to vote in the state of CT . Um , yes please ! And on a complete whim , I checked the Democrat box under political party affiliation . Ive been registered as an Independent since I was 16 , due mostly to my political apathy and disdain for being labelled . <p> But you know what ? Let 's call a spade a spade here . I identify with so many- of the Democratic- beliefs and do n't  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm honest , any time- ever ) . Now more than ever , its time to commit and show my solidarity ! <p> SUP yoga in Honolulu . <h> Family Time + Christmas Time <p> See , Christmas was a big deal in our house my parents always managed to make it the most magical time of year for us , so I 've got lots of warm fuzzies associated with this time of year . I indulged in Christmas tunes , movies , cookies , and glogg just like the old days and soaked up all the holiday vibes and it was GLORIOUS . <h> December 2016 Lowlights <h> Not Having Enough Time in NYC <p> The week before Christmas probably was n't the most convenient time to arrange mini-reunions with old friends from NYC , so not surprisingly there were a few people who were n't able to meet up with me . Not only that , but I was way too busy catching up on work that even if they were around , I probably could n't have afforded the time to hang out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , so if that comes to fruition then I 'm going to make sure I allow enough time in New York both for meet ups and New Yorky things , neither of which I did much of this time around . <p> Street art in Brooklyn . <h> Getting Sick <p> I definitely set myself up for this one . Going from hot weather to freezing weather after almost zero sleep and two red eye flights was far from my brightest idea . My body put me in its place within a day of returning home and I succumbed to a terrible cold that lasted nearly a week .

" You should marry an Aussie ! " <p> To be fair , I likely would n't have to field this comment anywhere near as much as I do if I was n't constantly professing my love for Australia and desire to remain in this fine country forever and ever amen . But most conversations I have seem to steer in this general direction , so I 've heard the suggestion- a lot . <p> As much as I may secretly be hoping to bag an Aussie , its taking a wee bit longer than expected ( kidding , mostly ) . And- unfortunately for me and other eligible foreign- bachelor(ette)s , Australia has made it significantly less than a breeze to apply and be approved for the partner visa . The application costs nearly $7000 and- usually takes- at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not enough to marry an Australian you must provide- exhaustive documentation to prove that you have n't gotten married- just to snag yourself a visa and that you 're in a legit relationship . Then you have to prove that you 've remained together after being granted the visa . So really , it takes YEARS until you 're in the clear with your Australian permanent residency if you marry an Australian . Its not as easy as most people think ! <p> But guess what ? There are PLENTY of ways to stay in Australia without marrying an Australian . If you 're running out of time on your Australian working holiday visa and desperately wish to remain in this country , or are elsewhere contemplating a semi-permanent move to the land Down Under , this post is for you . <p> Disclaimer : I am in no way an expert in Australian- immigration . The information below is just what Ive gleaned through my own personal research , and there may be other visa options available to you that I have n't mentioned . Contact an Australian migration specialist if you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Tourist- Visas <p> If you want to stay in Australia for less than a year , or want to buy some time to figure out a more permanent visa option ( aka what I did after my Australian work and holiday visa ended ) , a cheap and easy way to do this is by applying for an Australia- Visitor Visa . Note that you are not allowed to work while on a tourist- visa ( but , ahem , that has n't  stopped many a tourist ! ) . <h> 601/651 Visas <p> The 601 and 651 are electronic tourist visas ( aka no-passport-stamp visas ) that allow you to visit Australia as many times as you want in one year , and stay for up to 3 months during each visit . They are quick and easy to apply for , and with a near-100% grant rate , - you 'll likely get approved within a few days . The main difference between these two Australian tourist visas is that they are available to- citizens of- certain countries- ( e.g. USA citizens can only- apply for the 601 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs AU$20 while the 651 is free . <h> 600 Visa <p> If you want to be able to stay in Australia for more than 3 months at a time , the 600 visa is the one- you should go for . You can apply for a 3 , 6 , or 12 month visitor visa " the application cost ranges from AU$135-340 depending on the duration of stay . The process is a little more involved than the other tourist visas in that you 'll have to submit extra documentation , such as a short essay outlining what your plans are for your Australian holiday . <p> Last year the 600- visa had a 92% grant rate , so unlike the other tourist visas there 's a slight chance of not getting approved. - I have heard that Immigration is likely to deny your application for this visa if you have just completed a working holiday in Australia ( my guess is they are suspicious of you carrying on- working when you 're not supposed to be ) . You might want to either leave Australia for several months before applying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Australian tourist visas instead . <h> Australia- Student Visa <p> The easiest way to secure the right to live and work in Australia is to apply for the 500 Student Visa , which costs AU$550 . You must be accepted to study a full-time course at a school in Australia before you apply . You do n't  have- to be earning a degree at a major ( read : expensive ) university , though you can just enroll in a basic certificate program at an inexpensive school that accepts pretty much anyone . <p> The student- visa does come with some restrictions . First , you are only allowed to work 40 hours per fortnight while classes are in session ( e.g. 20 hours one week and 20 hours the next , or 30-10 , etc ) . You 're free to work as much as you want during scheduled course breaks , though . And second , you 're only allowed to stay in Australia for the duration of your course ( plus an extra month or two after- it ends ) . <p> Be sure to- consider the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply . On top of the visa fee , you 'll be paying your course fee , school expenses ( textbooks , etc ) , and the mandatory overseas health insurance coverage . You 'll also be committing to full time study , which is a significant investment of time on top of money . <h> Australian Work Visas <p> There are a lot of different Australian work visas you could be eligible for , but these are the ones you 'll most likely be looking at : <p> Overwhelmed yet ? Its ok , it took me nearly a full year to make sense of these options . I 'm hoping this post will give you the shortcut that I did n't  have ! <p> Instead of- going into detail with each work visa , I 'm going to explain a few concepts related to the visa process so that you can actually understand it as you try to determine which visa is best for you . <h> Skilled Occupation Lists <p> With these Australian work visas , you need to have a skill that Australia is looking for in order to be eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two separate lists which are updated on July 1 each year : <p> The Skilled Occupation List ( SOL ) is a short list of occupations- mostly related to engineering and medical sciences . They are in such high demand that if you can prove you have the right skills and experience for- one of them , you wont need to get- sponsored for a work visa . <p> The Consolidated Sponsored Occupation List ( CSOL ) is a much longer list of occupations- that- will most likely contain something that- fits your skills and experience . If your occupation is on this list , you will require sponsorship by a company , state , or government in Australia in order to apply for a work visa . <p> The visas listed above that are marked with an SOL can be applied for if you have a skill on the SOL . These are the ideal visas to go for if possible , since they do n't  require you to be sponsored by anyone . <h> Permanent Residency <p> Some of these work visas- allow you to work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are temporary visas that may provide a pathway to more permanent visas after a certain amount of time has passed . <p> The visas listed above that are marked with a PR provide instant permanent residency upon being granted. - PR will make your life much easier from an immigration perspective because it allows you- to live in Australia indefinitely with the freedom to work and travel as you please . Itll also make you eligible for certain healthcare benefits and ( after some time has passed ) to apply for Australian citizenship . <p> The visas above that do n't  give PR are more temporary visas that require you to put in some time living/working in Australia before you 're eligible to apply for another work visa that- does provide PR . Really , its just an extra step in the process and not a huge deal if your overall goal is to remain in Australia with the right to work . <p> When someone says they 've found a job that 's sponsoring them to work in Australia , they almost definitely have the 457 visa . This work visa is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application process and covers the costs , but you must work for them for at least 2 years before you 're eligible to apply for another work visa that provides PR . <h> Skills Assessment <p> You may need to undergo a skills assessment with the relevant authority to demonstrate that you are qualified in your chosen occupation . Do n't worry , it 's not a proper test that you sit for : the assessment typically calls for various documents that prove your education and job experience are highly relevant to that occupation ( e.g. school- transcripts , diploma or course certificate , employer references ) . You 'll need to show that a certain percent- of your coursework was directly related to your chosen occupation , and that you 've completed a certain number of years of professional work in that occupation , among other things . You must also score a certain number of points on- the Points Test- ( awarded for criteria such as age , educational background , English language proficiency , and skilled employment ) . <p> All of the work visas mentioned above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normally you complete the assessment , wait for your result , and- then apply for the visa only if you 've passed . <h> Regional Visas <p> Some of the visas above ( 489 , 187 ) require you to live and work in a specified regional area of Australia for the first X years that you hold the visa . " Regional Australia " is basically anywhere outside of the major cities , with low population growth . The entire states of South Australia and Tasmania are considered regional , so you could feasibly work in Adelaide or Hobart if you held a regional work visa . Refer to this list of regional postcodes to see where else you could work in Australia while on a regional work visa . <h> Have you had success staying in Australia long term ?

@@118793138 @7793138/ <h> The Best Thing to Do in Pai is Nothing <p> I 'm going to give you a little heads up if you 're heading out on the Southeast Asia backpacking trail : <p> At some point likely , multiple points you will meet someone who will wax poetic about a little town called Pai . Their eyes will glaze over as they carry on about how AMAZING it is and how much they LOVED being there . When you press them for more detail as to what makes Pai so great , they might mumble something about bungalows and what a " chilled out " place it is , never quite explaining why it is that you simply MUST go there . <p> And so , with no less than 5 recommendations , and little more than a vague notion of what Pai was all about , I found myself on a minivan to this hippie town in Northern Thailand . <h> Where Should I Stay in Pai ? <p> By the end of my 2013 Asia trip , I barely even gave a thought to where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I left the Pai bus station and started walking in the drizzle through town , past countless guesthouses toward the river , where I 'd been told was where the bungalows were . Of course I had n't bothered actually researching this I 'd just figured I 'd walk until I found some bungalows . <p> Well guess what ? I did n't see any bungalows on the river , just a bar that looked all but abandoned , and a restaurant that was n't open . And the drizzle had turned to rain . And I was carrying a 20kg backpack . AND AND AND all I wanted was to find a cheap bungalow to stash my bag and dry off in . <p> A wrong turn and a soggy walk back later , I decided to veer off the main road and up a steep dirt driveway where I saw a bunch of signs for accommodation , which led me to tada ! the land of bungalows , aka the Ing Doi House . <h> Ing Doi House <p> Ing Doi is quite literally an oasis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farmland , facing the mountains , and dotted with bungalows throughout . Allow me to illustrate : <p> Ing Doi is actually comprised of two sets of accommodation : I opted to stay in one of their bungalows in the Yawning Fields , which are cheaper and do not include a bathroom inside . Which is TOTALLY OKAY when the shared bathroom facility is like stepping into a rain forest ! Open air toilets and showers might sound weird ( yes , there were plenty of bugs ) , but you have plenty of privacy . <p> I stayed in the bungalow to the right above , which had a porch equipped with a hammock , table , and cushions to sit on . I hung out there every day reading and writing . When I felt like a change of scenery was needed , I 'd mosey on over to the reception area with my laptop . Ing Doi was the perfect setting to take it easy and get some work done . <p> You know what else was perfect about it ? The fresh fruit and muesli breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had every intention of checking out all the cute restaurants in town , but never made it for breakfast because I had to have this meal every morning . Best fresh fruit of my life ! Throw in some yogurt and muesli and you essentially have heaven in a bowl . The excellent coffee was also a nice surprise in fact , I 've declared it the second best coffee I had in Thailand ( after Size S in Bangkok , of course ! ) . <p> If you want peace and quiet , scenic views , private bungalows for less than the price of a dorm , a cool jungle bathroom , and fantastic food , stay at the Yawning Fields at Ing Doi . I could have ( and maybe even should have ) spent the entirety of my time in Pai doing nothing , never leaving Ing Doi , and been completely content . <h> What Can I Do in Pai ? <h> Check out the Night Market <p> Every night there are vendors set up on the main street in town selling food and crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whatever stalls happened to strike my fancy . For a couple of dollars , there 's your dinner . My personal favorite was the pancake ladys stand ( shocker ! ) ; she made tiny silver dollar-sized pancakes , each with a thin banana slice cooked right in the middle of it , which you can slather with as much chocolate/maple syrup/honey as you want aMMMMMMazing . <h> Sample the cafes and shops in town <p> It wo n't take you long to stroll down the main street in town , unless of course you get lured into the many shops selling jewelry , handicrafts , clothing , and other hippie paraphernalia . Far more tempting for me were all of the cute cafes and restaurants that I never ended up trying because I was hooked on the Ing Doi breakfast and Night Market dinners . <h> Hit up happy hour at the bars <p> From what I gathered , the bars in town are great for meeting awesome fellow travelers , perhaps even coordinating excursions with them . I 'm not sure if this is typical for the wet season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAD . Some were even closed entirely . Nothing much was going on at night in Pai , which I was secretly glad about because I really do n't  enjoy the bar scene in general . <p> But , I did reluctantly have one night out . I was just finishing up an enjoyable stirfry at a plastic table on the street at the Night Market when a guy asked if he could join me . As much as I wanted to be a hermit and head back to my comfy bungalow , as a rule you NEVER turn down a cute guy with an accent . <p> We ended up at one of the dead bars in town , where he revealed himself to be a somewhat pompous German . Edit : 19-year-old pompous German ( no comments from the peanut gallery , gefallen ! ) . In my head I was debating how soon would be too soon to cut out on him when he made the grand claim that New York City was located in New Jersey . He essentially told ME , the NYC resident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suffice it to say that I confidently googled that ish for him , won the argument , and made my exit . <h> Where Can I Go Near Pai ? <p> If you want to explore the area around Pai , rent a motorbike and drive around the countryside . The undulating roads will take you through the mountains and to numerous scenic overlooks and waterfalls . The scenery is absolutely beautiful at least , from what I saw on the bus . As a solo female traveler who does n't  know how to operate a motorbike , I unfortunately did not get to experience much outside of Pai . I 'm committing to learn how to ride on my next trip to Southeast Asia ! <p> I DID manage to do a couple things outside of Pai town , though : <h> Hike ( walk ) to the Temple on the Hill <p> There is n't a whole lot to see in Pai , but Wat Phra That Mae Yen ( the temple on the hill ) is easily accessible just on the edge of town . I schlepped there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked really cute but closed for the season . You have to walk up 220 very short stairs to reach the temple , where you 're rewarded with a view over Pai and the valley . <p> My verdict ? Call me jaded , but the temple on the hill is nothing special , and the view from it is not that impressive . <h> Rent a bicycle <p> On my last day in Pai , I was feeling uncharacteristically lazy and thought I should do SOMETHING other than lay on my bungalow porch . Against my better judgment , I rented a bicycle and started riding north out of town toward Mae Hong Son . <p> Now , keep in mind the fact that I bike almost daily at home in NYC , commuting 10-18 miles on work days and crossing bridges with heinous inclines . I have massive ( ly strong ) thighs as a result . I figured I could manage some hills by just beasting through them , no sweat . <p> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA no . <p> Wellllllll , partially yes . Ill pat myself on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not without sweat . I even made it up to a waterfall ( which was up a whole other set of hills on a dirt road , oy vey ) , but I cant say it was worth the effort or literal butthurt . I did n't  even realize how high I had cycled until I was biking nay , flying downhill on the way back into town . <p> The waterfall I made it to wasnt that impressive , and even further tainted by the fact that there was a noisy group of about 10 other backpackers there who had driven up on motorbikes . Ah well if nothing else , it was a crazy workout ! <p> I 'm a huge advocate of cycling , but honestly ? You do n't  need to cycle in Pai . The town is small enough to be covered on foot , and the surrounding roads are far too hilly to negotiate without a motorized vehicle as I found out first-hand . <h> Should I Visit Pai ? <p> If you have limited time in Thailand , I would not make Pai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice-to-visit than a must-visit place . However , if you are traveling long-term and could use a breath of fresh air and a nice place to relax , Pai is your jam . <p> If you go to Pai , do n't  expect to do or see much . Pai is more a place to just be . Go there to eat , drink , and chill out with no agenda . Do nothing , and enjoy it ! <p> ( But if you MUST do something , rent a motorbike and explore the countryside ! ) 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of June 2013 The minivan from Chiang Mai to Pai costs 150 THB ( $5 US ) . One leaves every hour from the Chiang Mai bus station , and you can just show up and buy a ticket there . <p> A basic bungalow at Yawning Fields ( Ing Doi ) costs 150 THB ( $5 US ) during the wet season ; it is more expensive during peak season , or if more than one person is staying in it . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I expected it to be a good day little did I know I was about to have myself an ever-rare perfect day . You know , the kind of day where you find yourself thinking over and over " OMG I love today ! " and not just because one exceptionally awesome thing happened , but because the day as a whole is just one continuous string of awesome . <p> I find that I tend to have my perfect days when the weather is glorious ; not the case with this one ! It was in the 50s , alternating between sun , clouds , and brief rain . It was a beautiful fall day though , so I cant complain . <h> Latin Quarter <h> Coffee at Cafe St-Henri Emery <p> I kicked off my second day in Montreal by checking out a coffee shop on my To-Try List near where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it did n't  seem to have the popularity and buzz of other indie coffee shops in town , there were enough rave reviews to coax me to pay this place a visit . <p> Um , whoa I had the best latte of my life at Cafe St-Henri . A big bowl of sweet milky espresso , served with sparkling water and a cloth napkin , by a barista wearing a dress shirt with a waistcoat very classy . The only thing that would have made it better is some fancy latte art . I am 100% coming back before I leave to pick up a bag of their espresso beans . But wow , perfect way to start out the day ! <p> Edit : I returned 2 days later to buy a bag of beans ( $15.50 CAD ) and got a free latte with it ! This time there was latte art . I could not be happier with this cafe ! <p> Adequately caffeinated , I headed north through the Latin Quarter , up St-Denis toward Plateau Mont-Royal . St-Denis is one of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bars all along the street . The buildings in this area are colorful and seem to all have balconies . I am ok with this . <h> Plateau Mont-Royal <p> I walked uphill on St-Denis to Plateau Mont-Royal until I looked to my left and saw this view down Ave des Pins : <p> I took off in that direction , chasing after the autumnal colors of Mont Royal in the distance . Within minutes , I got distracted by one of the side streets and took a little detour . Suddenly I found myself transported to a land where pretty terraced homes , fall foliage , and grit coexist . Kind of a strange juxtaposition , but I freaking LOVED IT . There are a few of these side streets between Duluth and Pins , west of Henri Julien Ave . <p> I popped out from the side street on Duluth Ave , heart of the Plateau and soon-to-become my favorite street in Montreal . The amount of street art here is just ridiculous its EVERYWHERE , from storefronts to houses to parking lots to side streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , including Brooklyn and that 's really saying something . <p> Aside from colorful art , Duluth Ave has a wide array of ethnic restaurants and shops . I already had plans for lunch , so I vowed to come back here for dinner at least once . <h> Schwartzs Deli <p> I was a woman on a mission for lunch : I just HAD to try Schwartzs Deli . Yes , its famous and thus touristy , but its famous for a reason : their smoked meat sandwich . Smoked meat is one of Montreals specialties , and Schwartzs is said to do it best . <p> When I arrived at peak lunch hour , there was a line out the door . I only had to wait about 5 minutes to get in , though ! Behold , one of the pros to solo travel : getting to cut the line when there 's room for just *1* person at the bar . Score ! <p> I do n't  think I was in the restaurant for more than 10 minutes . I knew exactly what I wanted , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much scarfed it down . Was it worth the hype ? I 'd say so ! <p> Post-lunch , I frolicked up St-Laurent Blvd , the main drag in the Plateau stacked with restaurant upon shop upon bakery . In an impressive display of self-control , I managed only to window shop at the many vintage stores and bakeries that caught my eye . You could do some serious damage to both wallet and waistline on this street . <p> A ways up St-Laurent , I turned right onto Ave du Mont Royal , another of the main streets in the Plateau . I did n't  find this one as interesting as St-Laurent or Duluth , but there were plenty of shops and street art to grab my attention . I was merely making my way to lunch stop #2 : bagels at St-Viateur . <h> St-Viateur Bagel &amp; Cafe <p> I 'm not really a bagel person , but if I were I 'd probably have walked into this Montreal bagel shop ready to mentally compare it to New Yorks famously delicious bagels . Montreal bagels tend to be thinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ODing on nutritionless carbs . Their everything bagel was great soft inside , slightly crisp on the outside . <p> I am , however , a coffee person as you might have gathered by now . As a coffee snob , I must say that their coffee was BAD . Like , regrettably bad . I took the tasteless hit of caffeine and went on my way . <h> Mile End <p> I walked from the Plateau toward the neighborhood of Mile End , which from limited research I 'd gathered to be a new hipster enclave and similar to the Plateau . No sooner had I begun walking off my bagel than a cat started following me down the street . No complaints here ! <p> In this neck of town , I noticed a plethora of winding staircases . Flat after flat with these gorgeous winding staircases ; these are n't  even fancy houses , mind you its just the norm in these neighborhoods . I 'll take a colorful flat with a balcony and winding staircase for a fraction of my NYC rent , please ! <p> Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And small gardens outside of most apartments . I do n't  hate it . <h> Coffee at Myriade <p> I needed to erase the abominable coffee from St-Viateur and escape the sporadic bursts of rain , so I ducked into a cool-looking cafe called Myriade ( ironically enough , on St-Viateur ) . I did n't  remember coming across this place in my research , but it looked legit . <p> I often find that other countries cant master filtered coffee or americanos like the US can , which is frustrating for someone who usually takes her coffee black . But the pour over I had at Myriade was PHENOMENAL . I 'm still dreaming about it , days later . When I got back that night , I immediately looked this place up online and found rave reviews rightfully so . What a happy accident it was to stumble upon it ! <p> It was getting late in the day and I was damn near wiped out , but I really wanted to catch the sunset at Mont-Royal . It rained a bit on my walk there , but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a massive double rainbow . This almost NEVER happens to me ! <h> Parc du Mont-Royal <p> It was starting to get dark by the time I finally made my way to this massive park . I contemplating saving it for another day , but dammit what if I did n't  HAVE another day to do this ? Nevermind the fact that it was supposed to take about an hour to walk to the top I would haul ass to see the sunset ! <p> Thankfully there are steep dirt paths that cut through the winding paved road as it slowly climbs the mountain , so you can cut your ascent time in about half if you 're fit enough to handle the path incline . Offroading it made the park feel more like a forest no cars , and few other people in sight . I was left to my own devices to frolic in the fallen leaves , just the way I like it ! <h> View from Chalet du Mont-Royal <p> I made it to the first lookout point before dusk , and the top just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth enduring for the view of Montreal from above . Framed by foliage , I 'm not sure if this scene could look any more gorgeous . Amiright ? <h> Plateau Mont-Royal <h> Dinner at Arepera Du Plateau <p> I 'd vowed to come back to Duluth Ave to have dinner at one of its many enticing restaurants . I 'd barely even made it 2 blocks down before an arepa bar caught my eye Arepera Du Plateau , DONE . ( Fun Fact : My favorite restaurant of all time is Caracas Arepa Bar in NYC ) . I had a pulled chicken arepa and guacamole with yuca chips and it was the perfect end to a perfect day in Montreal . <h> Bixi bike <p> Knowing I 'd be walking an obscene number of miles and ending up far from my hostel , I had planned on getting a 24-hour pass for Bixi bikes . I 'd activate it after dinner , and then use it all day the next day to bike around the city .

Hoi An is really pretty , but you do n't  need to allot much time there unless you 're planning on having a lot of clothes custom made . I 'd recommend staying in Hoi An over Da Nang . <p> You could always stop in the Hoi An area for a day or two to break up the long journey between the north and south .

The concept is fantastic : a swimming pool whose waterline just fades into the horizon of whatever stunning location it overlooks . It 's luxurious , it 's ethereal , and it 's just plain COOL . Being the frugal girl I am , I 've never splurged on a fancy hotel that has one of these pools nor do I have connections to anyone who has access to one . <p> In the back of my mind while planning my 2013 Asia trip were tales of westerners living it up in a 5 star hotel in Bangkok , and images of the city skyline from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry me far in Southeast Asia , but just how close could it take me to my infinity pool dream ? <p> Time and fate must have been on my side , because I made a couple of friends along the way who were keen to splurge and share a room at a fancy hotel on their last night in Thailand . I booked us a room on Agoda in the cheapest 5 star hotel with an infinity pool that I could find in Bangkok the Chatrium Hotel Riverside , for a mere $97 ( at 70% off ) . That 's under $100 for a 5-star hotel room . THAT IS RIDICULOUS ! <p> We stayed on the 33rd floor in a suite with a city view .

They run a cooking school on-site and the owner has also started an animal shelter on Koh Lanta how awesome is that ? A portion of profits from Time For Lime goes straight to supporting the shelter . They 've also got dogs and cats on the resort property for guests to play with . <p> Time For Lime is situated on the south end of Klong Dao Beach , where you can easily walk to Long Beach ( which has more going on ) .

Every morning I enjoyed my coffee and breakfast with this view : <h> Bungalows at Time For Lime <p> About half of the bungalows are equipped with AC while the other half have a fan . I stayed in an AC bungalow my first night , then moved to a far more affordable fan bungalow for the rest of my stay . It was really challenging to fall asleep those nights because the fan was attached to the ceiling , not pointing directly at the bed , and there was no way to stop it from oscillating . So most of the time , the fan was n't even blowing on me as I layed in bed . I 'd wake up early each morning in a pile of my own sweat . If you 're sharing a bungalow with others , definitely go for the AC but if you 're an independent traveler trying to be frugal without the luxury of splitting costs with others , buck up and suffer a few hot nights . You know it 's worth it when you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The bungalows at Time For Lime are REALLY nice . They are well built and , unlike most other bungalows you 'll encounter in Southeast Asia , are n't made predominantly out of bamboo . You should n't have any issues with bugs and critters creeping into your bungalow , but the beds are equipped with mosquito nets should you need them . <p> All bungalows have a private bathroom with cold showers ( which feel AMAZING in that heat ) . Right above the bathroom is a small loft area , ideal for kids to sleep in . I really liked that there was a desk just inside the door perfect for me to do my daily blogging and photo editing ! It was also really nice to have a fridge ( which comes stocked with a couple of water bottles when you arrive ! ) . <p> Note : If you prefer dogs , do n't worry there are dogs on the property as well ! They just do n't roam freely like the cats do . You can take them for a walk on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cats obviously I went a little snap-happy with the ones roaming around Time For Lime . They are all adorable . I noticed straight away that they all have nubby tails due to some sort of genetic defect , not caused by accident or illness thankfully . Some barely have a tail at all , others might have one a few inches long with a nub at the end . <h> Time For Lime Bar &amp; Cooking School <p> Time For Lime has some phenomenal drinks the mojito is their specialty , but they also make a killer lemongrass margarita . If you hit up their 99 baht happy hour , these are probably the best value drinks you 'll EVER find . The bar has a tree-lined view of Klong Dao Beach , and there 's a super-cool tree house space on the second floor just above it . <p> Every night , they run a cooking course that you can sign up for in advance .

Unless you plan on staying during low season , book as far in advance as you can . <p> As of May 2013 : During mid season , fan bungalows go for 790 baht ( $27 ) and AC bungalows for 1190 baht ( $40 ) .

@@118793163 @7793163/ <h> London Coffee Shop Roundup <p> I had few things on my agenda for the 2.5 weeks I spent in London last summer . Fresh off a 5 month backpacking trip around Asia , I wanted to relish some free time without the pressure of having to run around and sightsee every day . Having visited London 5 years earlier , I 'd already seen Big Ben and the London Eye , strolled down Portobello Road , and crossed Tower Bridge . <p> This time around , I turned my focus to London 's burgeoning coffee scene . I was justified in spending $5-6 US on a carefully-crafted cup of coffee in the name of research , right ? Well , that 's what I told myself as I sampled the brews at these London coffee shops : <h> Workshop Coffee <p> Workshop has 2 locations in the city . Their Clerkenwell shop has more of a restaurant vibe , filling a gorgeous space with both a bar and an area with seated tables . It 's ideal for grabbing coffee and snacks while catching up with friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt slightly out of place being alone and just wanting a casual place to sit with my laptop . <p> I also tried their Maryleborne location . On the other side of the spectrum , this shop is tiny and only has a few seats at the window . Most patrons come in to grab a cup of coffee to take away , rather than stay . I did n't feel entirely comfortable here either camping out with my laptop for an afternoon ; no wifi at either shop was also a bummer . <p> I had an americano at both Workshop locations , which was good but not as amazing as I 'd hoped . I should have gone with their specialty , the aeropress . <h> Prufrock Coffee <p> On the one hand , I walked into Prufrock , asked for a black coffee , and the barista looked at me like I was a moron before consenting to whipping me up an americano . Friendly , she was not . <p> On the other hand , it was pretty delicious . What 's more , the cafe itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , free wifi , great for working . I think I 'd be a fan of Prufrock if I went back and gave it a second try , but for now I 'm neutral . <h> Freestate Coffee <p> I wish I had n't  waited til the end of my stay to check out Freestate , and that I 'd alloted more time there . With free wifi and funky furniture , it would have been been perfect for holing up with a latte and a laptop . I also appreciated its central location and lack of crowds and pretention . Freestates definitely a hidden gem on Londons coffee scene . <h> Talkhouse Coffee <p> I have to give some love to this Portobello Road cafe , though I must preface this glowing review by admitting that I 'm a bit biased . I went to visit my Canadian friend Elyse , who was living in London at the time and working at Talkhouse as a barista . I asked her to whip me up her specialty , which was an aeropress coffee served in a small pot . Points for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the travel-related chat give Talkhouse a spot near the top of my London coffee shop list . <h> TAP Coffee <p> My final verdict ? The best coffee in London is at TAP ( Tapped and Packed ) . I went out of my way several times for a flat white at this Soho spot . Beyond the phenomenal coffee , TAP is an ideal place to set up shop for an afternoon and get some work done , with ample tables and free wifi . They also get the nod for the most crafty-looking punch cards I 've ever seen at a coffee shop ! <h> Federation Coffee <p> If we 're looking at London as a whole rather than just the city proper , then I have to give the win to Federation Coffee for the best coffee in London . Whenever I was n't up for trekking an hour to get to the city , I 'd take a quick bike or bus ride out to the Brixton Market in South London . Federation Coffee is stationed in the middle of this indoor marketplace , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed my routine of grabbing a table by the window , writing and editing for a few hours , and watching young women with strollers meet for lunch at the neighboring cafes . <p> Federation consistently prepared me the best flat white I 've had in my life . On the rare occasions I was feeling adventurous enough to order something different , I was more than pleased with their latte and americano . Flat white is definitely the way to go , though . <p> My only gripes were the lack of wifi and a bathroom , but Federation is not meant to be a working coffee shop . Even so , I was comfortable working on my laptop here , and it was never too crowded on weekday afternoons . Federation Coffee is well worth the effort of getting here ; make an afternoon of it by grabbing brunch somewhere in the Brixton Market , stopping at Federation for coffee , and wandering around the neighborhood . <h> What 's your favorite London cafe ?

@@118793174 @7793174/ <h> Be A Honey Badger ! <p> If there 's one phrase I drop on the reg other than " I 'm so excited ! " , it 's : " be a honey badger ! " . <p> A what ? , you ask ? <p> *Technically* , the honey badger is a weasel-like species from Africa but I 'm talking about the meme here. - To fully appreciate the honey badger , you should really watch this video . But if you 're like me and refuse to watch most anything that is n't a humorous and/or debaucherous tv show , let me sum it up for you in one sentence : <p> Sure , on paper the honey badger looks like an asshole but just think about it for a minute . How liberating would it be to fully and completely not care about what others think ? To not let what someone might say keep you from doing what you want to do ? To go after your dreams , no matter how big or scary or unrealistic they are ? <p> We could all stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? <p> Like when you 're scared to ask for time off so you can take that dream vacation to Paris or Maui , because you 're worried about what your boss will say or think of you . <p> Or are afraid to quit your job and give up a life of comfort and routine so that you can travel the world . <p> Or have a dream that seems so impossible to achieve that you stall and make excuses that just mask your fear and trepidation . <p> I like to consider myself somewhat of a honey badger , but I 'm definitely not all the way there . I still take offense the second someone says something that rubs me the wrong way , until I consciously remind myself not to let it bother me . And I sometimes let fear hold me back , like when I wuss out in Crossfit and do n't  lift as heavy as I 'm capable of . " You 're someone who does n't  know her own strength " , my coach once said to me . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barbell . <p> I 'm still working on caring less about things that do n't  matter , and pushing through The Fear so that I can continue to grow and improve myself . Every adventure I embark upon , every hike I tackle , every major change I make in my life has become easier with time because they 've made me a stronger , more confident person in the process . <p> To be clear , I 'm not advocating *literal* honey badgering . Tearing off a cobras head and having absolutely zero regard for others is a tad extreme and would make you some sort of social deviant . But you can definitely have honey badger tendencies . <p> I look at the honey badger as one who does n't get hung up on frivolous things . He does what he wants without hesitation or fear . He s determined , focused , and strong . A true badass , if you will . <p> So when I tell someone to " be a honey badger " , its my funny way of saying : Man up and DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorry about it . <p> You see where I 'm going with this . If you want to travel , be a honey badger and DO IT . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Love this .

India can be done for far less . <p> The remaining countries of Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record keeping , I seem to have spent $30/day on average in Northern Thailand , Cambodia , and Vietnam ; $40/day in Northern Laos ; and $50/day in the Thai Islands . I 'm confident my average daily spending in Laos would have been closer to $30 had I spent more time in the country to balance out the cost of getting around there . Note : Average daily spending does not include the cost of getting to/from the country , the visa , or any gear needed . <h> Total Expenditure <p> I have record of all credit card transactions and ATM withdrawals I made in each country , so I have a good idea of total expenditure for this trip . I spent $9200 on 5 months in Asia . Major chunks of this can be broken down as follows : <p> Though I did spend far more money in Nepal and India than I would have had I not been trekking or coerced into buying a train pass , this extra spending about balances out with the money I saved with my free flight to Asia . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of extensive travel through Asia . That 's about $1840 per month , which is slightly more than what I pay per month just for basic living expenses in New York City . When you add in all the non-essentials like eating out , drinking , gym memberships , shopping , and other activities , your monthly expenditure in NYC will effortlessly inflate . <p> If you live in New York City ( or a city with a similar cost of living ) , you will more than likely be saving money by backpacking through Asia . Fellow New Yorkers , take a second to let that sink in . <p> Now , let me repeat that : <p> IT IS CHEAPER TO BACKPACK THROUGH ASIA THAN LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY . <p> What 's more : you 'd be spending less than $1840 per month in Asia if you stayed there longer than 5 months , as your costs for flights and pre-departure items are fixed . In fact , if you exclude these things , it is feasible to get by on less than $1000/month in many Asian countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Thailand , Cambodia , and Vietnam . <p> So , in short it is very affordable to backpack through Asia . So now that moneys clearly not the issue what 's stopping you ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793193 @7793193/ <h> Did I Really Pay $15 to Sit in a Lao Bus ' Luggage Store ? <p> A few years ago , I swore off the infamous Greyhound bus from New York to Atlantic City . It 's notorious for a questionable cast of passengers , being reliably late , and even altering routes without notice . The last straw for me , though , was the ride where I was squished in the very back seat with 3 people , right next to the putrid bathroom , directly in the warpath of some rowdy drunken 20-somethings who were en route to party at the casinos . NEVER AGAIN . <p> I could n't imagine a more unpleasant bus ride to subject myself to that is , until I went to Southeast Asia , where it 's the norm to be squished into a passenger van that may or may not actually leave at its scheduled departure time . I spent many a ride with my bare legs stuck to the seats with sweat thanks to lack of AC . On at least two occasions , the person sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the sorts of things that come with the territory of navigating a third world country . You go into it almost expecting absurdity . <p> I thought I 'd seen it all as my 2013 Asia trip drew to a close until I took a Laos overnight bus to the Thai border . <h> Part 1 : Nong Khiaw to Pak Mong <p> Due to passport issues , I had to be in my last country ( Thailand ) of my 2013 Asia trip by June 15 . Booking an overnight bus across Northern Laos for the night of June 14 was risky and dare I say foolish , but I desperately wanted to maximize my time in Laos . <p> First , I needed to get back to the Pak Mong bus station , about an hours drive from Nong Khiaw . I could either take the one daily bus that passed through Nong Khiaw and spend the entire afternoon waiting at the Pak Mong bus station to catch that overnight bus , or I could enjoy my last day in Nong Khiaw and have a taxi take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the latter , and paid a pretty penny ( er , kip ) for this service . Oh and by taxi , I mean " friend " of the guy at the tourist office , who happened to have a truck and some free time that evening to drive me and some of his friends around . I was assured he would wait with me at the bus station until my bus arrived . <p> When we got to the Pak Mong bus station , one of the drivers friends got out with me and spoke to the person selling tickets so that he would know I wanted a ticket to the Thai border . For some reason , he would n't sell me the ticket until just before the bus was scheduled to arrive , so I sat nearby and kept looking at him every few minutes for any indication that it was time for me to get my ticket . <p> Then , a few stress-inducing things happened : <p> My taxi driver left <p> My taxi drivers friend left <p> My bus was late <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> My bus still had n't  arrived , an hour after its scheduled departure time <p> They still would n't sell me my bus ticket <p> My bus still had n't  arrived , 2 hours after its scheduled departure time <p> In short , I was left to fend for myself in a sea of non English-speaking Lao people , waiting for a bus that may or may not come , at a ramshackle bus station in this dirt parking lot : <p> Ah well , I thought . Its not like Ive never been alone in unfamiliar territory while entering crisis mode . I reassured myself by recounting the time I cycled around the island of Gotland by myself , got caught in a storm , and had to knock on a Swedes door begging to refill my water bottle because I was about to pass out from dehydration . Or the time I got off at the wrong train station in rural Italy where literally NOTHING and NO ONE ELSE was around , called a taxi driver , and communicated with him in Italian effectively enough to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . <p> Middle-of-nowhere , Laos is hardly a scary or dangerous place . If I were to run into any problems in catching my bus , I would deal with them just as I had those other times . It would all be ok . <h> Part 2 : Pak Mong to Huay Xai <p> More than two hours after its scheduled arrival time , the overnight bus from Luang Prabang finally stopped in Pak Mong . I could have kissed the ground in gratitude ! <p> As I stepped onto the bus , the bus attendant motioned to the right towards the luggage store rather than upwards toward the seats . I had already handed him my bags , so I figured hed misunderstood . I pointed up the stairs and he shook his head , ushering me into the downstairs space with everyones suitcases and backpacks . <p> Everyone else boarding at the Pak Mong station followed suit . When the doors closed and the bus started moving , it became painfully clear that this was where wed be sitting . Yup I spent the night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  know how they overbooked the bus from Luang Prabang . Maybe this is common practice in Laos ; maybe that guy at the tourist office did n't  actually reserve a seat for me when he " booked " my bus ticket . But since I absolutely HAD to be at the Thai border the next day , I had no other option but to take my seat in the luggage store . <p> Upon realizing that the next 9 hours of my life would be absurdly uncomfortable and , if nothing else , go down in the books as one of my more ridiculous misadventures , I embraced the situation . I cuddled with a suitcase and played footsies with the other people sitting near me . No matter that my iPhone inexplicably decided NOT to play any music the entire duration of the trip but conveniently started working again the second I got to Thailand . And nevermind the fact that wed be driving on one of the worst-kept roads in Southeast Asia , a portion of which is so rough and bumpy that wed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lao people sitting with me pulled out their barf bags within 5 minutes of departure ( sheesh , and I thought *I* was plagued with motion sickness ! ) . No really , this was my life ( as documented by my semi-functioning iPhone 4 ) : <p> Needless to say , no sleep was had . <p> About halfway through the journey , we stopped in Luang Namtha where a handful of people disembarked . My initial thought : FREE SEATS ! My next thought : I HAVE THE WHOLE LUGGAGE STORE TO MYSELF ! Suddenly , the thought of being able to sprawl out horizontally on the dirty floor sounded more appealing than sitting upright in a cushioned seat . And besides if I was going to do this , I had to do it for the whole journey , not just half of it . Luggage store all the way ! <p> We arrived in Huay Xai without incident very early in the morning , before the border even opened . No one on either side of the border batted an eye at my **31;493;TOOLONG passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUGGAGE STORE ! I CROSSED THE BORDER ON TIME !

In fact , Ive done most of these things multiple times and they 're still fun but what 's a semi-jaded New York City dweller to do to jazz up her fall and pretend like the inevitable god-awful winter is not upon us ? <p> In my quest to try out new fall activities last year , I came upon The Great Jack-o-Lantern Blaze an elaborate display of jack-o-lanterns at the Van Cortlandt Manor in Croton-on-Hudson . Tickets had sold out weeks in advance , so I made a mental note to buy tickets earlier this year . 6 weeks in advance , to be exact . <p> And so on the first Saturday in November , I found myself on a train with 2 of my favorites , heading upstate for some fall fun ! <h> Youre allowed to drink alcohol on Metro-North trains <p> We werent 100% clear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board , or sneak sips through a brown bag ? Turns out , no one batted an eye as we poured drinks into plastic cups from an old water bottle .

It made the hour-long ride pass by fast . <h> You can walk from the train station to The Blaze <p> We knew that the walk from the train would take about 10 minutes on a " non pedestrian-friendly road " ( whatever that meant ) . The road seemed friendly enough to us pedestrians there was even a sidewalk for part of the way . Its totally walkable . <p> To walk from the Croton-on-Hudson train station to The Blaze , walk north through the parking lot and onto the main road , take a right and walk to the end .

How is this even possible ? ! And as a follow-up question : How many pumpkins are there here ? <p> One thing I really appreciated was that all of the staff at The Blaze were super friendly and knowledgeable . Through them , we learned that of the 5000 ( ! ) pumpkins , only 1000 are real they are replaced each week and carved by a collection of volunteers . While we were somewhat bummed to hear that most of the impressive jack-o-lanterns before us were fake , it makes complete sense . Carving 5000 pumpkins per week for 6 weeks would be absurd ( and costly ! ) . <p> The details on some of these pumpkins are just RIDICULOUS . They are so intricately carved that its understandable that only 1/5 of the pumpkins are real and replaced weekly . <p> Some of my favorite pumpkin creations were the massive animals built from several jack-o-lanterns . Elephants , giraffes , and dragons , to name a few . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an octopus ( whose creator we randomly met in the tent afterwards ! ) , and other sea creatures . <p> Be sure to check out The Great Jack-o-Lantern Blaze next year !

" . <p> A what ? , you ask ? <p> *Technically* , the honey badger is a weasel-like species from Africa but I 'm talking about the meme here. - To fully appreciate the honey badger , you should really watch this video . But if you 're like me and refuse to watch most anything that is n't a humorous and/or debaucherous tv show , let me sum it up for you in one sentence : <p> Sure , on paper the honey badger looks like an asshole but just think about it for a minute . How liberating would it be to fully and completely not care about what others think ? To not let what someone might say keep you from doing what you want to do ? To go after your dreams , no matter how big or scary or unrealistic they are ? <p> We could all stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? <p> Like when you 're scared to ask for time off so you can take that dream vacation to Paris or Maui , because you 're worried about what your boss will say or think of you . <p> Or are afraid to quit your job and give up a life of comfort and routine so that you can travel the world . <p> Or have a dream that seems so impossible to achieve that you stall and make excuses that just mask your fear and trepidation . <p> I like to consider myself somewhat of a honey badger , but I 'm definitely not all the way there . I still take offense the second someone says something that rubs me the wrong way , until I consciously remind myself not to let it bother me . And I sometimes let fear hold me back , like when I wuss out in Crossfit and do n't  lift as heavy as I 'm capable of . " You 're someone who does n't  know her own strength " , my coach once said to me . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barbell . <p> I 'm still working on caring less about things that do n't  matter , and pushing through The Fear so that I can continue to grow and improve myself . Every adventure I embark upon , every hike I tackle , every major change I make in my life has become easier with time because they 've made me a stronger , more confident person in the process . <p> To be clear , I 'm not advocating *literal* honey badgering . Tearing off a cobras head and having absolutely zero regard for others is a tad extreme and would make you some sort of social deviant . But you can definitely have honey badger tendencies . <p> I look at the honey badger as one who does n't get hung up on frivolous things . He does what he wants without hesitation or fear . He s determined , focused , and strong . A true badass , if you will . <p> So when I tell someone to " be a honey badger " , its my funny way of saying : Man up and DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorry about it . <p> You see where I 'm going with this .

You 'd think that in all my island hopping and Australian escapades over the years I 'd have made more of an effort to explore the underwater world . <p> It begs the question : why on earth am I not scuba certified ? <p> I do n't know if y'all can tell , but I tend to catch onto things pretty late in the game . I 'm rarely an early adopter to fads and technology gadgets : I did n't get into Harry Potter or Friends til the very end of each series ( both are now dear favorites of mine ) , and I still adamantly refuse to join Snapchat ( because I JUST CA N'T HANDLE one more form of social media ) . <p> So yes , I 've been sitting out of the diving game even after all my travels through tropical climes and reef-happy islands . The more time passed , the more it felt like I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the point in getting certified so late in the game , after 10+ years of traveling ? <p> How dumb is that thinking ? I 'm telling ya , I can be insufferably stubborn . <p> But when I suddenly had 12 days in Thailand with nary a plan or obligation , I instantly thought : IT 'S TIME TO DIVE ! ! There was n't any thought process beyond that : no debating pros and cons , no contemplating other options for what to do during this trip . My gut was very clearly stating that it was time for me to get scuba certified . I may be stubborn , but my gut instinct always trumps everything else when I 'm able to tune into it . <p> Fresh off a fantastic 8 days on Koh Tao in which I blissfully toggled dual roles of Beached Whale and Newly Certified Scuba Diver , I 'm here to report that scuba diving is SO MUCH FUN . If you 're like me and have been putting off getting scuba certified for whatever reason , this post is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open water diving course on Koh Tao . <p> Shot with my GoPro . <h> Open Water Diving with La Bombona <p> First , you should know that Koh Tao is the cheapest place in the world to get scuba certified . This Thai island is renowned for its diving and its partying : if neither of those interest you , there are hundreds of other islands that might suit you better . <p> There 's an overwhelming number of dive schools on Koh Tao . How the heck do people pick which one to go with ? Most hotels will try to recruit you to sign up with their in-house dive school or , if they do n't have their own , then whatever school they 're in cahoots with . You could also walk down any of the main roads in Koh Tao and randomly pick one that catches your eye . <p> I took a more planned approach and arranged my open water diving course with La Bombona Diving-Cafe based on word of mouth . This was basically the best decision ever because the fabulous crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt safe and happy . I had an incredible experience diving with La Bombona , as the rest of this post will continually demonstrate . <p> Next , a word on course structure . Most Open Water diving courses will follow approximately this schedule : <p> Day 1 : Paperwork , gear sizing , and intro videos ( 2 hrs total ) Day 2 : A few hours of videos and theory , followed by a few hours of training in the pool ( 6-7 hrs total ) Day 3 : A couple hours of videos and theory , followed by 2 dives ( 12m ) , then a test ( 6-7 hrs total ) Day 4 : 2 dives ( 18m ) , then certification ( 5 hours total ) <p> The idea is that you learn the theory and apply it while working up to being able to dive to 18m , which is the deepest you can go with an Open Water certification . Once you have an Advanced certification , you can dive up to 30m . <p> I may have followed Mr. White around our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with La Bombona was how their staff is all from Spain and conduct classes in both English and Spanish . While I was there , there was another group doing their Open Water course in Spanish while mine was done in English . Obviously I was n't there to speak Spanish , but I think it 's really cool how they have that flexibility and have incorporated some of the Spanish culture into their onsite cafe ( which serves paella , among other Spanish eats ) . They never mix language groups in any of their classes , and they cap each class at 4 students max . That 's super important in fact , I 'd say that 4 students is the absolute most you 'd want in your diving course . Any more than that and training takes too long , and you get less attention from your instructor . <p> I learned how to dive from Sam , who moved to Koh Tao nearly 2 years ago from Menorca . Patient , passionate , and experienced , he was exactly what you 'd want in a scuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , US , and Germany . I loved our group ! <p> Wouldnt you like to learn how to dive here ? <p> On our first day of class , we spent the morning tucked in a corner of the dive shop learning theory and the afternoon getting acquainted with our diving gear in the pool . Not just any old pool , mind you but decidedly the best pool that any dive school on Koh Tao has access to . We got to practice at the Tarna Align Resort , a fancy property in Sairee whose main pool has 3 different depth levels . We started out on the shallow end practicing key skills like breathing and clearing our masks and regulators , then moved to the deeper levels to work on buoyancy and swimming with our gear . Sam would demonstrate a skill first , and then we 'd each perform it one at a time until we got it right . With a larger group , it takes longer to get through but at the same time , I felt more comfortable demonstrating after watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think 3-4 students in an Open Water group is the sweet spot . <p> Personally , I found this first day more challenging than the dives we did in the ocean the following days . Between trying to process all of the new information we 'd been bombarded with and demonstrating mastery of skills we had only just learned , it was a lot to take in but oh-so-necessary with our first Real Dives fast approaching . <p> Diving at Twins , near Koh Nang Yuan . <p> The final two days of the Open Water course were the most fun , for obvious reasons . When you 're diving in Koh Tao , you can take either the morning boat or the afternoon boat ( or sometimes the night boat ) and get 2 dives in before heading back to the island . You 'll often find a few different dive schools sharing one boat , and these boats are staggered so that not all of them leave at the same time . There is typically more than one boat at a dive site , though . <p> Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top deck covered in ( faux ) grass perfect for laying out on between dives . Despite the fact that I often get seasick ( #FORESHADOWING ) , I absolutely LOVE going out on boats . I am damn near my happiest while basking in the sun at sea , and you better believe I maximized my time up on that deck ! If this brings you great joy as well , know that most of the other dive boats do n't  have a magnificent top deck like this . <p> Sam flipping into the water ; I 'm laughing on the left . Screen shot from video by William Heintze via La Bombona Diving . <p> So how were the dives ? ? <p> Well ! On the very first one I floated right back up to the surface after we descended . I was completely befuddled , wondering why the f that happened , but I did n't  even have time to panic because Sam immediately swam up and pulled me back down with him. - I quickly realized that I should have gone horizontal after descending staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all went smoothly . I loved seeing schools full of thousands of fish swimming by . We also spotted some big groupers and moray eels on most of our dives . No turtles or whale sharks , unfortunately ( though sometimes they are seen around Koh Tao ) . <p> Some of the dive sites were just swarming with other divers while we were down there . I guess there 's not much you can do about that , especially when you 're training and can only go so deep which kind of limits your options for movement . <p> My major takeaway from these early dives ? Boy do I need to work on maintaining neutral buoyancy . When you 're neutrally buoyant , you effortlessly float underwater at your desired depth . You can make a few minor adjustments to achieve this , but mostly it comes down to mastering your breathing technique . I found it difficult to get close to the reef and fish without fearing that I was going to touch them because I could n't hold still . <p> Screen shot from video by William Heintze via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You 're not allowed to take photos during your open water diving course . I totally get why they have this rule you 've got so much else to worry about on your first dives that adding camera operation to the mix would just be foolish . <p> But fear not ! La Bombona has an in-house video team that tags along on one of your dive days to capture both you and everything you 're seeing on your dives , all packaged up into a video montage that you can buy afterwards if you 'd like . This is n't something a lot of Koh Tao dive schools offer their students , so the fact that it was an option for us at all was pretty awesome . I 'd have liked to have had some still shots of the fish or of us in action ( hey , I 'm a photographer not a videographer ! ) , but I grabbed some screenshots from the video that will do just fine . <p> Check out our video below ! <p> Video by William Heintze via La Bombona Diving . Note that I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video file was a tad too large ! <p> With all 4 open water dives completed and our final test passed with flying colors ( which by the way is SO SO EASY , do n't  even spend a second worrying about it ) , we headed back to the dive school for celebratory drinks and t-shirts . <p> Photo via La Bombona Diving . <h> Fun Dives in Koh Tao <p> After my open water course , I wanted to do a few " fun dives " where I could just enjoy diving without having any tests looming . So I hopped on a morning boat out to Chumphon one day with divemaster Guido and one of the students from the Spanish Open Water course . <p> Oh my lord , the water was insanely choppy that day . I remember sitting on the top deck watching the boat lurch back and forth , up and down , thinking " wait a second , how am I not feeling nauseous right now ? ! " . I had a brief moment where I got to experience the rough sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I went from 0 to 60 and vomited just before we were to get our gear on . <p> Guido gave me some peppermint balm to rub under my nose and assured me I 'd feel better underwater . He was right I felt almost normal again once my surroundings stilled . Gracias a Dios ! <p> Shot with my GoPro . <p> The best thing about these fun dives was being able to escape the traffic and have my own space to explore . While I did my training dives , there was a lot of brushing up against fellow students and near-collisions as we all tried to grasp bouyancy while being hyperfocused on following Sam ( and maybe did n't  notice the diver directly above or below us ) . But on the fun dives it was just the 3 of us with more space and probably a higher comfort level in the water . <p> In my opinion , the Chumphon dive site is better suited for Advanced divers than Open Water divers because it goes so deep . We Open Water divers can only go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we missed out on . Still , we managed to see plenty across two dives here . I attempted to document it with my GoPro and the results were pretty shoddy .

I cant wait to try diving elsewhere around the world . I have a feeling its going to be a handy tool in my travel toolkit . <p> I hope to complete my Advanced certification in the near future if you have any suggestions for where I should go to do it , leave a note in the comments below ! <h> Thank you to La Bombona for hooking me up with an Open Water diving course , certification incentives I may receive . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of June 2016 La Bombona Diving-Cafe is located in Mae Haad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Open Water diving course with them costs 7500 THB ( about US$213 ) .

@@118793197 @7793197/ <h> Eureka Skydeck : Melbourne From the 88th Floor <p> I 'm a girl on a mission this month aspiring to conquer as many items on my Melbourne To-Do List as I can before I relocate to Sydney in March . <p> I do n't  know why it took me 5 months to get myself to the highest vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere ( me and exceptional viewpoints are like a month to a flame ) , but on a recent summer blue sky day I needed a break from work and without much deliberation , hopped on my bike and rode into the city . <p> Hello , Eureka Skydeck ! <p> On an impulse , I paid AU$5.50 for the Sun &amp; Stars upgrade , which permits entry on 2 consecutive days . Seemed kind of a no-brainer to pay a few bucks extra to do it twice totally worth it , in my mind . On Day 1 I went for sunset and nighttime views , and on Day 2 I returned during the day , which meant that I walked away from my Eureka Skydeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I found the golden hour light to be a little bit awkward when shooting the skyline from above , so I do n't  have many photos from this time of day ( i.e. 1-2 hours before sunset ) . Instead I patiently waited for sunset on the western side of the Skydeck . I had no problem setting up my tripod by the window 20-30 minutes before sunset , but the crowds started to gather once it got close to showtime ( mind you , this was also a Saturday night ) . <p> The actual setting of the sun was pretty lackluster , but about 20 minutes later the sky cranked it up in the saturation department and gave us a little tease . How good is this ? ? ( Note : I used the in-camera HDR function on the Canon 5d Mark III not bad , I say ! ) . <p> While I was crossing the river to get to the Eureka Tower , I noticed a sign for the Lunar New Year fireworks that were set to go off around 9:45pm by the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sunset . How serendipitous was it that my uber-belated Skydeck experience happened to coincide with the fireworks ? ! I totally did n't  mind hanging out for another hour to wait for them . <p> I used that time to take some test shots and adjust my camera settings speaking of which , you 'll be battling some seriously nasty glare on the Skydeck windows no matter the time of day . I was n't able to find a cure-all solution to block it out , but at night at the particular window I was shooting through here , what worked best was putting my lens right against the window with the camera on the tripod . <p> Blah blah blah , enough nerdy camera speak . Because FIREWORKS ! ! <p> AHHHH so good . Easily a highlight of my time in Melbourne . I 'd never witnessed fireworks from above before , and Ive got ta say : its really something special . <p> The following day , all recovered from the high of the previous night , I returned to the Skydeck during mid-afternoon for Round 2 . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot toward the east , and so I was super glad that I " splurged " on the ticket upgrade . <p> I think I spent the most time looking down on Federation Square and Flinders Street Station . They look like such massive landmarks from the ground , but from above they appear as if in miniature . <p> Looking toward the southeast , the landscape is decidedly less city-like with the prevalence of suburbs , parks , and water . The Royal Botanic Gardens and Albert Park Lake are relatively close to Eureka Tower and look pretty ( freakin massive ) from up high . 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of February 2016 Admission to the Eureka Skydeck costs AU$19.50 . The Sun &amp; Stars upgrade is an extra AU$5.50 and allows two entries over the course of 1-2 days . The Edge upgrade costs AU$12 and gives you access to a ledge that has glass walls , floor , and ceiling . 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Wow Lindsay I 'm so happy to have found your blog ! 1 .

@@118793199 @7793199/ <h> Highlights From The Overland Track <p> If you 're thinking of hiking the Overland Track in Tasmania , you should do your research beforehand ( unlike me lesson learned ! ) . Anticipate inclement weather and pack accordingly . And perhaps most importantly , look at the route and decide how much time you 'll need in order to complete your preferred side treks . <p> On that note , here 's what you can expect on a 6 day itinerary for the Overland Track with minimal side treks ( though they 're noted after each day , should you be interested ) <h> Day 1 : Ronny Creek to Waterfall Valley ( 10 km / 4-5 hours ) <p> With my pack at its heaviest , I set off around midday from the Ronny Creek car park into a drizzly meadow . True to form , the weather cleared within 20 minutes and I was able to ditch my rain gear for the rest of the day . <p> The first day of the Overland Track is terrifically scenic ! The trail makes its way past a few small waterfalls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent to Marion 's Lookout . From here , you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains , lakes , and valleys . It 's the perfect spot for a lunch break ! <p> View of Cradle Mountain from Marions Lookout <p> The second half of this segment covers some very rocky ground around the base of Cradle Mountain and ends with seemingly endless stairs down into Waterfall Valley . I was completely knackered by this point and all but crashed upon arriving at the hut . I 'm really glad I made the effort to take some photos of the night sky later on , though I mean look at it ! <p> Optional Side Treks : <p> Cradle Mountain summit ( 2-3 hours ) <p> Barn Bluff summit ( 3-4 hours ) <p> Note : These climbs are only worth doing on a clear day , otherwise you wo n't see much from the top ! <h> Day 2 : Waterfall Valley to Windermere ( 8 km / 2-3 hours ) <p> The second day of the Overland Track is all about the lakes ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more convenient as this segment of the trail is largely out in the open air through the moorland . <p> Since this day is easy and almost entirely flat , the side hike to Lake Will is basically a no-brainer . You can walk closer to Barn Bluff mountain and further along the lake , where you might witness weird things like a massive tree growing smack in the middle of a sandy beach . <p> The end of the day 's trail segment leads into Windermere Hut , where you can relax by the lake after a day of trekking ( or swim if you 're not a wuss like I am ! ) . I opted to hang out on the hut deck with a pademelon ( wallaby-like creature ) and then sit out in the sun reading on a boulder nearby the trail . <p> Optional Side Treks : <p> Lake Will ( 1 hour ) <h> Day 3 : Windermere to Pellion ( 17 km / 4-6 hours ) <p> I look back on Day 3 not-so-fondly as the day of hell . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by a sad face . Sounds about right ! <p> To be fair , my negative feelings about it were almost exclusively due to the awful weather . This segment starts out through moorlands and affords some pretty fabulous views of the valley below in better conditions . But with limited visibility , all I could do was trudge on and hope the next hut was n't too far along . <p> Then , the trail enters the woods and winds its way downhill . It was dark and soggy at midday , and heavy rain had penetrated my shoddy rain jacket and rain pants ( chafing for days ! ) . Suffice it to say I bore precisely zero resemblance to a happy camper . I gingerly stepped around puddles and tree roots to minimize discomfort , eyes on the ground at virtually all times . The mud maze went on for so long that I thought I must have missed a turn at some point and , feeling defeated and slightly freaked out , turned around to retrace my muddy steps . <p> Thankfully I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same hut as me the night before and they assured me I was heading in the right direction . I calmed the heck down and resolved to follow them for the remainder of the day . I finally reached the New Pellion hut limping and chafing in no less than 6 spots on my body . It 's one of the newer and larger huts , so I quite enjoyed warming up and resting there after a traumatic morning of trekking . <p> But ! On a more pleasant day , I 'm sure Day 3 of the Overland Track would be perfectly enjoyable . Really ! <p> Optional Side Treks : <p> Mt . Oakleigh ( 4-5 hours ) <h> Day 4 : Pellion to Kia Ora ( 9 km / 3 hours ) <p> Day 4 started out gray and rainy , but I was in much better spirits knowing it would be a short day on the trail . This trail segment moves through both rainforest and a valley , so it 's less maze-like than Day 3 . <p> Had it cleared in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ossa which would have made it a fuller day of hiking ; but it was overcast and drizzly when I reached the trailhead , so I carried on to the Kia Ora hut instead . It ended up clearing shortly after I passed it , go figure . The lack of rain made it slightly more bearable when we were trekking through massive mud trenches . There are hardly any platforms placed on the trail in this section , and at some points you have no choice but to step right into the deep piles of mud . What a cruel , cruel joke ! <p> Day 5 is the day I got my groove back on the Overland Track . With the weather on my side , I set off on what was my longest day on the trail . Note : I 'd have split this into two days if I were taking the ferry to Cynthia Bay rather than hiking there the following day . <p> There are a few side treks to some impressive waterfalls along this segment DO THESE . You can drop your pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk down . Fergusson Falls is especially impressive close-up ; D'Alton less so . Hartnett requires more effort to get to because the most of the path is muddy , and then you have to find your way down a bushwhacked path that takes you right down to the water . I 'd highly recommend the extra effort here because the falls are way cooler when you can get closer to them , vs. the obstructed view you get from above if you do n't bother with the bushwhacking . <p> Hartnett Falls <p> Fergusson Falls <p> The midway point for me on Day 5 was the newly-constructed Bert Nichols hut . I was bummed not to be able to stay overnight here , but I hung out for a bit and made myself lunch before carrying on to Narcissus . <p> The second half of the day 's trek was wonderfully dry and flat . I had a ball frolicking in the tall trees , but my favorite part was towards the end when the trail opened up to sweeping views of the mountains over the valley . Crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be TMI , but my feet have never looked more disgusting than they did at the end of this day . After nearly 10 hours of trekking in damp boots , they were completely pruny and literally steaming when I took off my shoes and socks . SO GROSS . <p> Optional Side Treks : <p> D'Alton &amp; Fergusson Falls ( 1 hour ) <p> Hartnett Falls ( 1 hour ) <h> Day 6 : Narcissus to Cynthia Bay ( 17.5 km / 6-7 hours ) <p> Day 6 wins the award for dullest day of the Overland Track . I now understand why most trekkers opt to take the ferry from Narcissus to Cynthia Bay rather than hike the 17.5 km there is n't much to see here . There 's the occasional view of Lake St. Clair , but aside from that it 's just woods . It 'd be fine on a day hike , but after 5 days of really awesome scenery it just seems a bit pointless . <p> View from Echo Point <p> On a more positive note , I 'd finally woken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter pack , made it a fairly easygoing day on the trail . Had it not been for my heavily blistered feet and bruised hip , I might have enjoyed my final day on the Overland Track . Instead , it felt more like a slow-going race to the finish line . Toward the end , I had to break out my iPhone , put my cheesy playlist on speaker , and sing along just to get through the final stretch . <p> I swear , the path to the Visitor 's Centre dragged on for AGES . I limped the whole way there , then tore off my boots the second I reached the campsite , threw on flip flops , and ordered a double burger with fries and a flat white at the Lake St. Clair Lodge because I FINISHED ! ! <p> A Tasmania Parks Pass costs 30 AUD for hikers ( valid for 8 weeks ) . If you already purchased a parks pass for your vehicle ( like I did when I was roadtripping in Tasmania ) , you can just use this while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely is n't ! I keep finding with these big treks that they 're actually pretty expensive for what they are . Worth it ? Oh for sure . But still , if you 're forgoing creature comforts to rough it in the wilderness , it feels like you shouldnt be spending much money at all , right ? 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793229 @7793229/ <h> The Best View Of The Sydney New Years Eve Fireworks <p> Why did I decide to move to Australia in December , smack in the middle of my beloved Christmas season , where I 'd be alone for the holidays ? <p> One reason : I was dying to see the New Years Eve fireworks in Sydney . <p> Yall know about my love for bridges , and the Sydney Harbour Bridge is certainly a stunner . Throw in the Sydney Opera House , a city skyline , and some fireworks and hot damn ! Show me a better backdrop for a colorful pyrotechnic display , I dare you . <p> So , catching the Sydney New Years Eve fireworks was very high on my Must-Do List for my upcoming year in Australia . Almost immediately after booking my flight to Sydney , I began researching locations from which to catch the fireworks . If I wanted a good view , my options were threefold : <p> Befriend someone with connections to an apartment right on the harbour with a good view ( Meh , not likely ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of and have a semi-obstructed view ( Sounds like hell would it even be worth it ? ) <p> Pay $385 AU to attend an exclusive dinner party right on the harbour with a guaranteed good view ( #*&amp;$*#&amp; Are you for serious ? ! ) <p> While trying to wrap my mind around #2 aka giving up 18 hours of my life for , best case scenario , a view of the fireworks framed by trees from the garden I turned #3 over in my mind . Could I justify dropping that much money on one night ? Every frugal bone in my body screamed HELL TO THE NO out of habit . <p> View from The Point <p> But I did n't give up Christmas and extra weeks of paid work to take a gamble on this . I was here to witness the Sydney New Years Eve fireworks in their finest glory So call it YOLO , go big or go home I splurged on a ticket to see the NYE fireworks in Sydney . <h> New Years Eve in Sydney 's Royal Botanic Garden <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most easily accessible views of the Sydney Opera House , Sydney Harbour Bridge , and city skyline . It 's an extremely popular location from which to catch the Sydney New Years Eve fireworks . <p> There are three ticketed New Years Eve parties held in the Royal Botanic Garden : Lawn With The View , The Point , and Midnight At The Oasis . If you do n't have a ticket to one of these , the only other location from which you can view the fireworks in the Botanic Garden is at Mrs. Macquarie 's Point , the wooded hill just behind The Point and Midnight At The Oasis ( see rejected Option #2 above ) . The garden is closed to non-ticket holders at 3pm , but in reality you 'll need to arrive by 10am if you want a chance at a decent spot at the point . <p> Lawn With The View $270 AU Bennelong Lawn This is the most affordable and casual option , where attendees sit in lawn chairs or picnic blankets on a hill near the Opera House . You 're closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the Sydney Opera House right in front of the Sydney Harbour Bridge . A picnic box is included for snacking , while drinks are available for purchase . <p> The Point $355 AU Fleet Steps North This festival-themed party has guests sitting at tables right on the harbour just near Mrs. Macquarie 's Chair . Food from the adjacent vendor tents is included and drinks are available for purchase at the cash bar . From this location you have THE most sweeping view of the skyline , where the Opera House appears right next to the Harbour Bridge . I thought this would have been the best spot for pictures of the fireworks , but the view is obstructed by too many sailboat masts . <p> Midnight At The Oasis $385 AU Fleet Steps South This is the fanciest option , located just next to The Point but slightly more inland . From here , the Opera House appears beneath the Harbour Bridge rather than right next to it , but the view is not interrupted by large sailboat masts so it 's actually a better vantage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireworks . Attendees are assigned to communal tables and get to enjoy a three course meal ( excluding drinks ) , live band , and dance floor as well . When I booked just 5 weeks out , this was the only event that still had tickets available . <p> Note : In 2015 , there will be a 4th party added called NYE Under The Stars . It will be an all inclusive food/drink event located right next to Bennelong Lawn for $395 AU . <h> Midnight at the Oasis <p> While most everyone at my hostel had packed up breakfast , lunch , and dinner and woken up at 5am to spend the entirety of New Years Eve camping out in the Botanic Garden for a chance at a free obstructed view of the fireworks ( again , see the aforementioned rejected Option #2 ) , I took it easy all day and did n't venture out until early evening . <p> The party began at 7pm . As we entered , we were all given boxes containing fancy appetizers like salmon , ricotta salad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , quickly surmising that it was the reject table due to its undesirable location just behind a tree . It hardly mattered to me though , since I planned on standing at the water 's edge to catch the fireworks . <p> I had assumed I 'd be placed at a family table and forced to make small talk with older folks around me , but thankfully I was joined by a group of five friends from the UK who were around my age . I could n't have asked for better company ! Chatting with them was an excellent way to kill time before the fireworks . <p> In my very unprofessional opinion , the food provided was not so great . To be fair , though , I think this might be due to my meal choices . Did I really choose beef and strawberry cake over chicken and chocolate cake ? Really ? ! I love chicken and chocolate infinitely more , so not sure what I was smoking when I selected the other options instead . My UK companions seemed to be underwhelmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake was lovely . <p> One thing I did really enjoy was the live band that played a mix of covers and original songs . With all the nicely dressed folks around me sipping champagne , it felt like I was enjoying music at a wedding reception . They were on until 10:30 , at which point the music transitioned to a DJ set . I opted not to hit the dance floor because I was solo and with a massive backpack of expensive photo gear but mostly , I was preoccupied with scouting a prime spot on the waterfront and taking test shots before the fireworks went off ! <p> OKAY OKAY , enough with the wordy recap . You want to see the fireworks , do n't you ? <p> Disclaimer : I 've watermarked these images because I feel like they 're susceptible to being ripped off , and that 's no bueno . I know , watermarks are the worst I hope never to have to use them again ! <h> The 9pm NYE Fireworks <p> At 9:00 , a small 8-minute display of fireworks went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Opera House near the city ( very close to where Lawn With The View was held ) , and further out in the harbour toward Fort Denison and The Point . There was only a blip of fireworks under ( not over ) the Harbour Bridge , so it was n't quite the shot I was looking for but it was good prep for the big show at midnight ! <h> The Midnight NYE Fireworks <p> The big fireworks show started at midnight and went on for 12 too-short minutes . In addition to the same two small fireworks clusters from the 9pm show , they set off bigger fireworks over the Harbour Bridge and Opera House . There were only a few of these bursts , though . I 'm not sure if this is the reason behind it , but those displays left big clouds of smoke and haze over the bridge . Allowing a minute or two for the smoke to clear before setting off more fireworks yielded better visibility in the end . <p> And fear not ! There was plenty of space along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographing the fireworks . Most people were content sitting at their table or viewing them from the bar . <h> So was it worth it ? <p> For me , yes . I know I would have regretted it had I not gone all out and splurged on my New Years Eve ticket to Midnight At The Oasis . I do n't think it was quite worth $385 AU , but I had a great time and got the photos I wanted so I 'm happy . It 's not really something you would do every year , but to experience it once is something special for sure . <p> And for anyone debating between the New Years Eve parties : If you prefer the excitement of seeing the fireworks up close and right above you , opt for Lawn With The View or NYE Under The Stars ( the new party debuting in 2015 ) . Otherwise , if you want a photo-worthy view of the fireworks over the skyline , Opera House , and Harbour Bridge , go for one of the other two parties . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your style . <p> Alternatively , if you 're considering the free Option #2 , camping out all day at Mrs. Macquarie 's Point : I ca n't speak from experience , but those at my hostel who did it were completely exhausted from the experience and did not come back raving about how awesome it was . The general consensus was that they were glad they did it , but it was n't super amazing . <p> Pin it ! <h> Heading to Sydney ? <p> If this article helped you , I 'd greatly appreciate it if you 'd consider making your Sydney trip purchases through the following affiliate links .

NYE in Sydney is just the best ! : D My table there was actually behind a tree too , but maybe its because I booked it so late and that 's all that was left .

Thanks and sorry for so many questions . <p> Thanks , Jorge ! : ) It was a 3 course meal , but do n't  expect too much portions were small and not that delicious . I do n't  remember what exactly was served , but you get a snack box when you walk in , then either a meat or veg dinner box like an hour later , and then your choice of a dessert ( probably the best part of it ) . There 's a bar you can buy all sorts of beverages from . Ending time maybe 11pm ? I left shortly after the fireworks show ended , but the dance floor was still going . <p> David Lo <p> Very informative post , thank you . I would like to attend the Midnight At The Oasis also , but the website indicates tripod is not allowed . Did they have that restriction last year also ?

( though a bit different from the one I had ) <p> Catherine Griffiths <p> Lindsay , your photographs are inspirational . I travel a lot mainly looking for wildlife and over the last few years have managed to take some nice shots of leopards , jaguars etc to adorn our walls at home . I head Tasmania in December looking for mammals , but fly out of Sydney on New Years Day , so have booked the Midnight at the Oasis as you did , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few questions about the photography if I may as I 'm outside my wildlife photography comfort zone ! . I have been specifically told that tripods are not allowed , so will take a beanbag looking to rest on a table or ledge somewhere . What lens did you you use ? I have a Canon 300mm F2.8L II which I 'm sure would be too big and a Canon 17-55mm . At what mm/focal length were your shots taken ? Did you use bulb ? I 'm guessing that I 'll need to use bulb , with a remote release cable , for 2-3 seconds at ISO 100 . Perhaps you would be kind enough to let me know the Aperture , Speed , Focal Length and ISO of one of your shots ? I have read that some photographers use an ND Filter to allow them to take longer exposures to capture multiple bursts of fireworks ? Apologies for asking so many questions <p> Thank you , Catherine ! I was able to bring my tripod last year no problem , but I did n't  even use it . You should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the waterfront . A beanbag might be a good idea in case you want to adjust the angle ( totally taking this idea and picking up one of these for myself ! ) . <p> I used a 16-35 on my 5dmkIII which was too wide ( I shot at 35mm and cropped all of my shots ) . I think 50-60mm would be good for getting the whole scene in longer if you want to get up close . Your 17-55 should be pretty good at the long end . I did n't  use bulb , just threw the camera on 2s timer before each shot . <p> Looking at my images , most were at ISO100 , f/8 , and 5-6s ( it was BRIGHT ! ) . I cant remember my focus technique , but I think I must have focused on the bridge given my focal length and aperture , getting the scene mostly in focus was not an issue ! <p> No problem at all with all the questions I love to geek out over photography talk ! : P I hope you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thank you so much for taking the time to look up your settings and share your experience . Did you use a cable release , because if you did n't  the shots are even better ! <p> About the beanbag . I travel with my boyfriend , Steve , and he insisted that we got a beanbag . We got one with small lightweight polystyrene balls as the filling , so it is light to take on a trip/flight etc . One particular way that we use it is for taking shots of animals when on safari i.e. we rest it on the the door frame with the window of the car wound all the way down . <p> We fell out when he had another idea . We now also take an old make up bag of mine , about 10 X 8 inches , with a pvc lining . Very light to travel with , but he then fills with sand or grains of rice .

@@118793233 @7793233/ <h> Taking The Everest Base Camp Trek By Storm <p> The whole impetus for the trip was hiking the Everest Base Camp Trek , something I 'd been saying I 'd do the next time I was in-between jobs and could afford to spend at least 3 weeks in Nepal . Then somehow 3 weeks turned into 5 months , 6 countries , and countless adventures the first of which was EBC . It was an incredible way to kick off my travels <p> Heres what you need to know before taking on the Everest Base Camp Trek : the route , the challenges , and the highlights along the way <h> The Route to Everest Base Camp <p> The traditional Everest Base Camp trek begins in Lukla and goes to base camp and back , and can be done comfortably in 12 days . If you 're feeling ambitious and want a more varied hike , I highly recommend adding the Phaplu to Lukla segment ( an extra 4-5 days ) to your trek . <h> Everest Base Camp Itinerary <p> I trekked from Lukla to EBC and back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiking up , I encountered few other people in fact , sometimes my porter-guide and I were the only ones staying the night at our tea house . But on the way back in late February , we were passing by lots of fellow hikers who were just starting off . <p> Tip : Flights in and out of Lukla are often delayed or cancelled due to low visibility , so be sure to pad your trek with an extra day or two both before and after , just in case you ca n't fly on your scheduled day . Aim to be on the first flight of the morning and you 'll have the best chance of taking off as scheduled . <p> Note that I had originally planned on adding on the side trek to Gokyo ( via the Cho La Pass ) , but because of the snow day that set us back on Day 4 , we did n't  have enough time for it . We ended up having a couple of extra days , so we took our time going back down to Lukla . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I completed the Everest Base Camp trek in a very cushy 15 days because I had extra time , but it can definitely be done comfortably in 12 . If necessary , you can trek all the way back from Gorak Shep to Lukla in 3 days . <p> The EBC trek is really not that strenuous . You do n't necessarily need to be in great shape to complete it , though if you are n't you may be hating your life on the steep uphill segments just before Namche and Tengboche . For the sake of gauging difficulty , I will say that I was in better-than-average shape during this trek , having spent the previous year rock climbing 3x/week and biking almost daily . But then again , I met a very skinny , petite Aussie girl who had done the whole trek carrying her own bag on her back ! <p> Tip : Hire a porter ( or porter-guide ) to carry your bag for you during the trek . Having less weight to carry will make the trek significantly less difficult for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a recommended porter , guide , or porter-guide . The extra $20 or so a day is more than worth it , trust me ! <p> Rather than physical difficulty , you 'll be more concerned with the cold weather and the altitude while doing the Everest Base Camp trek . You should take these into serious consideration before setting off on the trek and ensure you 're well prepared to face them . <h> The cold <p> Days on the trail are fine the sun is out and you 're generating adequate body heat while trekking . You 'll be sufficiently warm dressed in various layers . <p> Nights in the tea houses are COLD . Once the sun goes down , it 's game over . You put on every layer you have with you , you sit in front of the wood stove for as long as it 's running , and then you jump straight into your 4-season down sleeping bag til sunrise . Forget about showering north of Namche during winter you 'll never want to take your hat and gloves off , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lukewarm water on yourself . I can assuredly say that I have never been more cold in my life than the nights I spent on the Everest Base Camp Trek . <p> Tip : Ask for extra blankets and have them fill your water bottle with hot water before going to bed . Put the water bottle inside the foot of your sleeping bag to keep your feet toasty all night ! <p> If you take on the EBC Trek in the offseason during winter , be prepared for snow . Heavy snow had us snowed in at Namche Bazaar for a couple days , but hiking on snowy paths in the days following was not bad at all . We also encountered snow one day along the way , around Dingboche surprisingly it was more peaceful than cumbersome . Be prepared for snow to alter your trekking schedule , but do n't  let it hinder your enjoyment of the trek . <p> If you see yourself complaining about the cold nonstop and not being able to put mind over matter for the 2 weeks you 're trekking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd think twice about going to base camp . <h> The altitude <p> Altitude sickness is the real deal , folks . Do your research and ensure you schedule rest days during your trek so that you 're properly acclimatized . It 's tempting to keep on trucking when you feel fine and have a good rhythm going , but do n't overextend yourself or skip rest days . <p> I only experienced the mildest of headaches while at high altitudes , but I met people who fared worse . I heard of people having to turn around and go back without making it to base camp because of altitude sickness . It 's important to listen to your body , rest often , and drink as much water as you can when trekking at higher altitudes . <p> Even if you 're lucky enough not to experience altitude sickness , you WILL feel the altitude in some way . The higher up you go , the less oxygen you have to breathe , which makes trekking more and more of a challenge . The easiest of trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , I felt like I was crawling it was SO FRUSTRATING because there was n't anything difficult about the trek . At lower altitudes , I would have casually strolled along my way without even thinking about it . But with a limited supply of oxygen , my body demanded that I slow down . <h> Highlights Along The Everest Base Camp Trek <p> Objectively speaking , the scenery along the Everest Base Camp Trek is just STUNNING . I was really glad to be taking on the trek solo and free of distractions that way I was able to fully soak in the constant fetching views of the Himalayas , images which are still ingrained in my mind after the fact . <h> Lukla <p> I expected Lukla to be a dump based on my research , but it was a pretty decent village teeming with locals . During peak season I assume it 's overrun by trekkers , but I did n't see too many when I was there in February . <p> My time in Lukla was spent drinking real coffee , taking hot showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free wifi at Illy Cafe . There are also a couple of stupas you can check out nearby . <h> Namche Bazaar <p> We got snowed in at Namche for 2 days and could n't trek til the snow passed . It was an incredibly frustrating couple of days because I was so antsy to get on the trail ! Instead I resigned myself to coffee , wifi , reading , and writing . Not a bad way to spend my time , all things considered . In fact , Namche is an ideal place to take a rest day I 'd recommend scheduling 2 days here on the way up . <p> Namche 's chock full of trekking stores , souvenir shops , lodges , and cafes at least half of which were closed for the offseason while I was in town . I spent an exorbitant amount of time at Namche Bakery amazing coffee , free wifi , and delicious pizza ! <h> Tengboche <p> I was really eager to see to monks chant in Tengboche , but I was n't feeling well when we arrived that afternoon so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view from my bedroom , though I had a view of the beautiful monastery through one window , and the mountain range through the other . If you 're going to vomit in the Himalayas , you might as well have a panoramic view , right ? <h> Dingboche <p> We had a rest day scheduled in Dingboche , which was quite unfortunate because it 's a ghost town . Literally NOTHING was open , and no one was out and about aside from the yak and donkeys . I read way too much these 2 days . <p> One thing you CAN do is a short hike uphill , where there are a couple of stupas and prayer flags and a nice view of the mountains and village below . <h> Gorak Shep <p> Like Labouche , Gorak Shep consists of a few trekking lodges and nothing more . It 's the setting off point for the two major landmarks of the EBC trek : Kala Patthar and Everest Base Camp . And it 's so damn cold at night that trekkers essentially get in and get out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kala Patthar <p> You really have to earn the view from 5545m with a 2 hour climb . Coupled with the altitude , this will probably be the most difficult part of the entire trek . I hauled my ass up that hill and stopped every few minutes to breathe , and it was hell . But once I got to the top I did n't care anymore . I had a 360-degree view of Himalayan magic , which made it worth the hardship . <p> Tip : When you get to the top of Kala Patthar , keep going up until you ca n't possibly go any further . You 'll be on a rock crag experiencing vertigo , but the view from the very top trumps any other view you had below . <h> Everest Base Camp <p> There are 2 base camps : old and new . The old base camp is closer and more than adequate to say you 've reached Everest Base Camp ( there 's a sign and everything ! ) . The new base camp is at least an hour further , closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain much by visiting the newer base camp , so I was fine with going to the older one . <p> Base Camp is empty before March since no one climbs in the winter , but during climbing season it 'll be filled with tents . <p> Since it was before March , they had n't  yet changed the sign to say 2013 ! <h> The Bottom Line <p> The Everest Base Camp Trek will be unlike anything you 've ever experienced before . It is physically and mentally exhausting and definitely not for everyone . If you have any interest in doing it but are hesitant for whatever reason , you should go for it just be sure to prepare yourself ! Its one of those *once in a lifetime* experiences you cant possibly end up regretting . <h> Got any questions about the Everest Base Camp trek ? Ask in a comment ! 205744 @qwx1065744 <p> Photos are great . They tell great story about Everest too . I loved the way you wrote the experience of Everest trek .

@@118793248 @7793248/ <h> 3 Things This Tourism Agency In Laos Is Doing Right <p> I 'm all for supporting local businesses , generally snubbing all chains in favor of mom &amp; pop shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants . And this mentality carries over to my travels : I 'd rather immerse myself in local culture and customs and eat street food than stay in fancy , impersonal hotels or join a tour group . It 's all about living local ! <p> So then WHY did I hang out at a western business each day I was in Luang Namtha , eating pizza and hanging out with other travelers ? ! <p> Said establishment is Forest Retreat Laos , a tourism agency in Laos Luang Namtha , to be specific . Yes , it 's run by Kiwis and frequented by westerners but it 's SO MUCH MORE than a tourist haunt . While catering to westerners , Forest Retreat Laos also promotes sustainable tourism and supports local villages . They 've managed to blend a restaurant , bar , lounge , and tour company into one business endeavor , catering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Bottom line : they are doing things right . Specifically , 3 things : <h> Targeting Western Tourists <p> What sets Forest Retreat Laos apart from every other restaurant lining the main street in Luang Namtha is that they are the only ones targeting western tourists with their restaurant , bar , and lounge . Case in point : their creative signage <p> Photo Credit : Forest Retreat Laos <h> Restaurant <p> Awesome food ? Uh yeah , I could go for some of that ! Asian food is awesome in its own right too , but when you have 5 straight months of it , the promise of awesome *western* food is quite alluring . Between that and the stellar TripAdvisor reviews , I decided to forgo the local joints in favor of some brick oven pizza er , correction : GLUTEN-FREE brick oven pizza with REAL CHEESE in rural Laos , mind you . Forest Retreat Laos makes their gluten-free dough in-house and imports cheese and other delicacies from Thailand and New Zealand , which is why most menu items are closer to western prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order every time I dined there ; there are no less than 8 options each for pasta , pizza , sandwiches , salads , and pancakes . I can vouch for the chicken pesto sandwich , nutella pancake , and margherita pizza . Where else are you going to find these dishes in Laos ? And bonus : they are sensitive to dietary constraints , offering items that are gluten-free , dairy-free , vegan and veg-friendly . <p> But most importantly : THEY HAVE REAL COFFEE ! ! As a coffee snob , I wont say that their french press coffee is particularly amazing , but its lightyears better than the Lao coffee at any other restaurant which made me very happy : ) <h> Bar <p> Thankfully , you can offset the price of your meal with some absurdly cheap drinks ! Cocktails made with the local whiskey ( lao lao ) start as low as about $2 US . Their signature drink , the Forest Retreat cocktail ( lao lao , lime , mint , lemonade ) , is a must-try . If you 're craving a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for around $4 each . Not only are drinks cheap here , but they 're seriously good . <h> Lounge <p> Forest Retreat Laos is n't just a restaurant or a bar its a place to chill out after a day of frolicking and adventuring . Their comfy couches and communal seating lend themselves to making new traveler friends while in town . In fact , its where I met the Dutch couple that I ended up traveling through Northern Laos and taking *2* boat trips with ! <p> I especially appreciated the reliable wifi and book exchange at Forest Retreat . Internet at my guesthouse was extremely spotty , so I used that as another excuse to frequent the lounge on a daily basis . It was so nice to have somewhere to go to just decompress and get back some of the comforts I 'd left behind in the US . <p> * <p> The truth is , even the most independent of travelers like to feel comfort while on the road ( at least once in awhile ! ) . Forest Retreat Laos has set themselves up to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfamiliarity of a foreign land for a bit . <h> Promoting Eco-Tourism <p> Anyone that 's living green scores major points in my book . Forest Retreat Laos eco-friendly habits include providing free purified water bottle refills , using cloths instead of napkins and paper towels , and serving cocktails with reusable bamboo straws rather than plastic ones . These seemingly little things add up to something much bigger when you think about how much waste could be generated over the course of a year of running a restaurant business . <p> What 's more , as an eco-tourism agency they run a huge variety of tours around Luang Namtha . Kayaking , rafting , trekking , boating , cycling , homestays , or any combination of these is an option . No matter which tour you choose , Forest Retreat Laos will ensure that there is minimal environmental impact and maximum appreciation of the the region . In a place fraught with tour operators of questionable quality , I felt like I could trust Kiwi owners Dre and Karen . Thanks to their honest advice , I skipped trekking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint ! <h> Supporting Local Villages <p> What impressed me the most about Forest Retreat Laos is their tremendous support of the local villages . In their own words , <p> We support 4 different ethnic minority villages , creating and promoting homestay and cultural immersion experiences . The income generated by ecotourism is sustainable and greatly assists the villages to be self-sufficient . It also empowers the villages to preserve their ancient traditions and tribal culture . We also employ these villagers to maintain our trekking trails and be our local guides , porters and cooks for our tours . <p> Not only does Forest Retreat Laos put money into the villagers hands for assisting with their tours and excursions , they also employ locals to work in their restaurant kitchen . These villagers are taught how to prepare western dishes , maintain proper hygiene , and even speak a bit of English . They get to take this experience , along with generous wages , back to their families and live better lives as a result . <p> Forest Retreat Laos has set the bar high for eco-tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to stop in to sample their fantastic western comfort foods or book an eco-tour ! <p> Note : I was not paid or in any way compensated for reviewing this establishment .

@@118793249 @7793249/ <h> Sydney Harbour Walk : Manly to Spit <p> After the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk , the Manly to Spit harbour walk is Sydney 's second most popular walking track . It 's nearly twice as long ( 10km ) and lacks a dramatic ocean coastline , but its landscapes and views are much more varied . <p> Admittedly I left this walk til my very last day in Sydney , but I promise that has zero to do with its quality . The Manly to Spit walk is one of the best walks in Sydney . If you do it , I recommend starting the walk at The Spit it 's better to end at Manly because then you can hang out there afterwards and cool off with a swim or grab dinner/drinks . <p> The walk looks something like this : <p> Start the Spit to Manly walk by crossing Spit Bridge , admiring fancy harbourside houses on one side and flashy boats on the other . If you 're endlessly amused by ridiculous things like I am , you might also LOL at the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold sand beaches , a few of which are only accessible by boat . Clontarf Beach is the largest and most popular of the bunch . Anna and I could n't help but ogle the sleek million dollar houses that were literally RIGHT ON the beach as in , step out your front door and hello , sand ! Million dollar homes with million dollar views . <p> One way the Manly to Spit walk is different from most other Sydney Harbour walks is that its track is very wooded . You 'll be walking through the trees quite often sometimes even without a view of the water ! There are some side tracks that lead to alternate views or exit points , so at times it almost feels like a woodsy maze . The side track to Grotto Point yields a view of Balmoral Beach from across the harbour . <p> But then you reach a lookout point over Sydney Harbour and suddenly you 're centered again . You ca n't see the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Sydney Opera House from the Manly to Spit walk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose Bay beyond it . And as always , sailboats for days . <p> Shortly after the trail curves around the harbour towards Manly , you 'll come to a gem of a view over Crater Cove . There is also a side track you can take that leads down to Dobroyd Head , but unfortunately we did n't have enough time to do this bit . Most of it is wooded rather than along the coast , so if you 're only in it for the harbour views you can probably skip this side track . <p> Towards the end , the trail descends to Forty Baskets Beach , where you 'll see more fancy waterfront property that will make you want to marry a millionaire Sydneysider . These fancy houses line the remainder of the track around Manly Harbour . If you fancy a swim but do n't  want to battle the surf at Manly , the Fairlight Tidal Pool beckons along this final stretch . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I find myself flashing back to Sydney on a weekly basis , so its all too appropriate that I share one such flashback on ye olde blog . <p> I spent most of 2006 studying abroad at the University of Sydney , taking fun classes like Australian Sports Culture and Italian . I 'd spent 3 summers working at a photo lab to save up for all the traveling I did : from a month in New Zealand , to mid-semester trips to Queensland and the Outback , to winter break on the West Coast . My weekends were spent exploring Sydney and its beautiful beaches , but I always came back to Sydney Harbour . The Opera House , the Sydney Harbour Bridge , the modest skyline I still think Sydney is the most beautiful city Ive ever seen . <p> But when I think beyond the obvious reasons for my loving Australia and Sydney so much , I realize that it goes far deeper than that . <p> Sydney was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went from being a coffee hater to a coffee snob , spending much of my free time holed up in local coffee shops with a cappuccino and some reading . I developed a fascination with bridges , with an insatiable need to cross , pass under , and photograph damn near every bridge I see . And perhaps most pivotal of all , I began teaching myself photography : frolicking different neighborhoods , camera in hand , and purchasing my first SLR shortly after returning to the US . Coffee , bridges , frolicking , and photography are still some of my favorite things , 7 years later . I do n't  even know who I 'd be today without these passions . <p> Also Sydney was where I realized I had the freedom to live the kind of life I wanted . There was a world beyond rigorous schooling and small town living . With just a semester left of college after I returned from Australia , soon I would be free to recraft my life however I liked . I saw the proverbial light at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it led . Most of all : I felt free . <p> Sydney will always be my happy place . Though I 'm currently settling back into life in New York City , I cant WAIT to get back to Australia sometime in the not-too-distant future .

But what else can you do in Hoi An ? <h> Frolic around Old Town Hoi An <p> Be warned : Old Town Hoi An is extremely touristy . You will see far more middle-to-upper aged foreigners roaming the streets than locals . And if you so much as glance for a half second toward any street or market vendors , they will be on you to buy something from them . <p> Still , you MUST pay a visit to Old Town Hoi An if for no other reason than the fact that it 's a beautifully preserved UNESCO World Heritage Site . It 's just so pretty you ca n't help but be charmed by the hanging red lanterns and bright yellow buildings . Somehow , the streets are n't that crowded or loud despite the influx of tourists ( they 're probably all shopping or dining ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicular traffic , which makes for high quality frolicking . <p> I was content just aimlessly wandering the streets , doing some ( window ) shopping , and photographing my surroundings , but if you 're the type who prefers more structured traveling , you might consider investing in an Old Town Ticket . For about $6 US , this one-day pass will get you into 5 attractions of your choice ( i.e. old houses , temples , museums , and workshops ) . <h> Bike around Hoi An and surrounds <p> Old Town is easily covered on foot , but it 's fun to rent a bike for a day and ride around on two wheels . And for more practical purposes , it might be worth hiring a bike just to get from your guesthouse to Old Town , as much of the budget accommodation is a long walk away . <p> Even better ? Hire a bike and get lost in the countryside . I did n't  follow a particular route , but I started out by following the main road out of town toward the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a side street . Before I knew it , I was navigating a maze of paths through coconut groves . Another time , I took a random left ( northbound ) turn instead and ended up cycling past paddy fields . Its like being in a completely different place once you escape town . <h> Experience Hoi Ans Specialty Foods <p> One unexpected joy for me in Vietnam was the food . It was undoubtedly a highlight of the 3 weeks I spent in this country . Hoi An in particular is known for its exceptional cuisine , which I took full advantage of by eating my face off for 4 straight days . <h> Local Specialties in Hoi An <p> Hoi An has bragging rights over a few dishes that are uniquely its own . <p> I have two words for you : CAO LAU . Oh my sweet baby Jesus , is this dish to die for ! Cao lau is Hoi An 's specialty noodle dish , made from chewy noodles topped with pork slices , herbs , and chili jam . The noodles have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most noodles . The most important ingredient ? Water from a secret well outside of town . In fact , this particular water is so crucial to the recipe that many restaurants and cooking schools wo n't even teach you how to make this dish , since you wo n't be able to replicate it without this water . <p> I may have had a minor freakout over the thought of possibly never being able to enjoy this delicious dish again and had it for 3 straight dinners . As a result , I did n't get a chance to sample Hoi An 's other local specialties : white rose ( steamed shrimp dumplings ) , com ga ( chicken rice ) , and mi quang ( noodle soup ) . <h> Cooking classes in Hoi An <p> There is an absurd amount of cooking classes on offer in Hoi An . Most follow the same general format : a visit to the morning market to pick up ingredients and learn about them , travel to the cooking school ( many will take you on a short boat trip up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be held ) , learn how to cook 4-5 dishes . Some classes are more hands-on , while others are more demonstration-based , so make sure you do your research ! <p> However , because I 'm extremely frugal and had already planned on taking a formal cooking class when I returned to Thailand , I was n't sure if I wanted to pay $25/each for 2 full day cooking courses . While I was scouring TripAdvisor to see what my options were , I came across some restaurant reviews that mentioned $5 cooking classes . Oh reeeeeeeally , now ? <p> Yes , apparently there is a cluster of restaurants in the so-called backpacker district that all offer cheap food and informal cooking classes . I had lunch at Cafe 43 one day and inquired about their class . They asked me what time I 'd like to drop by the following day ; I told them I was fine with any time , and they said to stop in around 4 or 5pm . Hows that for informal ? <p> I selected 2 dishes off the menu that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken curry . When I came back the next day for my class , the chef went through the recipe step-by-step as she demonstrated the process , which I hastily transcribed . She had me cut some vegetables and mix some ingredients , but the class was predominantly a demonstration . This was fine with me because I just wanted a peek into the Vietnamese kitchen , but if you 're looking for the full cooking course experience you should definitely book a proper full-day course . <p> My main take-away from this mini-cooking course was that Vietnamese cuisine is ridiculously simple and fresh . I walked away feeling like I could easily replicate the dishes at home and none of them called for a bunch of obscure ingredients that I 'd only use once , which I appreciated . <h> Go to the beach <p> Who knew Hoi An had a beach ? Actually , it has TWO beaches : <h> Cua Dai Beach <p> This is the main beach , and is a straight shot out of town on the main road .

If you go for a swim here , note that there 's a sharp drop off into the ocean from the sand , so you probably wo n't want to go too far out . <h> What 's your favorite thing to do in Hoi An ? 205739 @qwx1065739 <p> As of May 2013 <p> A bike rental costs 20,000 VND ( $1 US ) for the day . <p> An informal cooking class at a local restaurant should cost $5 + the cost of your selected menu items .

Subject to change and/or be amended , here 's how 2014 is currently shaping up : <p> Cartagena exploring the old town , with possible day trips to a mud volcano and a nearby island <p> Santa Marta staying in an Aussie-run ex-cartel house with possible day trips into the mountains , waterfalls , or other adventure activities <p> Tayrona NP camping ( er , hammocking ) on the beaches and getting some serious tanning and reading in <h> April 5-6 : Washington DC <p> Its been a few years since my last DC trip , and when I found a $0 ticket from NYC to DC during the supposed peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itll be a quick trip , as I arrive mid-afternoon on Saturday and likely leave early evening on Sunday . Aside from the cherry blossoms and my standard frolicking , I do n't  really have anything else planned . Anyone have any must-do tips while in DC ? <h> April 18-21 : Utah <p> Thanks to a plethora of credit card miles and 3-day Easter weekend , I 'm heading west for a desert adventure ! From Salt Lake City , I plan on roadtripping down to Canyonlands and Arches National Park . The weather should be ideal for hiking , which is my #1 priority of this jaunt ( well , technically #2 if you count photography ) . I really just want to be surrounded by gorgeous nature for a few days , and I think Utah will fit the bill nicely . <h> May ? ? : Boston <p> I am long overdue for a Boston visit . Has it really been YEARS since my last one ? ! Spring in Boston is just glorious , so I 'm hoping to snag a cheap bus ticket there for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new apartment , and I trust well follow our usual Boston routine of good coffee , frolicking , photo shooting , and a night in with wine and The Sound of Music . <h> June 14-18 : Cape Cod , MA <p> I missed it last year as I was in Asia , but I 'm planning on joining my family this year on their annual Cape Cod trip . I 'm looking forward to the legendary low tides on the bay side beaches , clam chowder , drive-in movies , Provincetown , and slumber partying with my sisters and co . <h> July 4-6 : ? ? ? <p> I 'm trying to plan a trip for 4th of July weekend . Perhaps this would be a good time for my first-ever trip to Chicago ? Or maybe I 'll stay more local and find another way to take advantage of the long holiday weekend . Any suggestions for where I should spend 4th of July weekend ? <h> August 29 September 13 : Iceland <p> Behold , the crown jewel of my 2014 travel lineup : ICELAND ! I am deliriously excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first week , 2 friends and I ( and possibly one other ) will be doing the roadtrip thing around the Ring Road and invariably ODing on hot springs , waterfalls , and bright green landscapes . Then during the second week , one friend will be joining me on the 4-day Landmannalaugar Trek , where well hike from hut to hut and further burn our retinas from visual sensory overload . This trip is the perfect storm of dramatic scenery , culture , and outdoor activities . I 've never looked forward to the end of summer , but I 'll be counting down the days til this adventure ! <h> What do you think of my 2014 travel plans ?

Its why I adore both the coast and the Outback of Australia . There 's just something very exotic about deserts they 're harsh , hot , wide open spaces . You never quite know what 's out there , but that 's the thrill of it . <p> California walks the coast/desert line , too : it 's got San Francisco , Big Sur , and other coastal gems ; but then it also has Death Valley and Palm Springs further inland . I 've been well aware of and enamored with the first three for YEARS , but it was n't until I read about one of my favorite blogger 's experience in Palm Springs last year that this locale made it onto my radar , and promptly leapt onto my *To Do When I Finally Live in California Someday* list . <p> Oh yeah , someday I 'll be getaway-ing in Palm Springs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Relaxin ' at The Ace Hotel <p> So , I know historically I have a bit of a problem with chilling out and doing nothing , but I really think a stay at the Ace Hotel could help remedy this . When I lived in NYC I 'd sometimes hang out in the Ace Hotel lobby on W 29th Street . By day , it 'd be a cozy coffee shop aglow with Macbooks ; by evening , it 'd morph into a buzzing bar . Ah , the hipster-chic life . <p> Palm Springs ' Ace Hotel has a similar feel , but given its rather warm location , it brings something a little different to the table with its urban-meets-desert theme . The hotel is backed by mountains and a perpetually blue sky . The rooms have a retro-camping vibe to them , complete with walking sticks , DIY BBQ kits , and old school cameras for guests to enjoy . <p> Best of all : The Ace Hotel &amp; Swim Club is super affordable . If you do n't splurge on a suite , you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still enjoying all the standard hotel amenities : admission to the uber-trendy Swim Club pool , access to the Kings Highway diner-turned-restaurant , and use of the lobby photo booth , to name a few . <h> Hiking and Biking in the Desert <p> Whenever the relaxi-radar maxes out , I figure I 'll pry myself out of my poolside lounge chair and venture out into the surrounding desert for some activity . Conveniently enough , Palm Springs has plenty of outdoor adventures to entertain , particularly for frugal travelers who prefer to immerse themselves in nature via their own two feet ( or two wheels ) . I reckon I 'll snag a vintage Cruiser from The Ace and explore Palm Springs by bike for a breezy outing . <p> Then , I 'll up the ante and take to the Indian Canyons on foot . Located just southwest of town , the Palm Canyon trail meanders around a stream and is lined with California Fan Palms , creating a glorious contrast against the gorges and barren desert landscape . Much of the trail traverses a plateau yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little side trail to the Stone Pools : an idyllic picnic and swimming spot if it 's not been a particularly dry season . <h> This post was written as part incentives I may receive . 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793372 @7793372/ <h> $5 Adventures in Siem Reap <p> Let 's be real : one of the major draws to Southeast Asia is how insanely affordable it is to travel there . I knew Cambodia was one of the cheaper countries to get by in , but it did n't really hit home until I found myself indulging in $1.50 cocktails in Siem Reap . Let me repeat that : cocktails are $1.50 in Cambodia , commonly found in the form of 2-for-1 $3 happy hour specials . I figured it would be a crime NOT to take advantage of such a steal after all , I 'd be paying $10+ for one mixed drink back home in NYC . <p> This Cambodian Bargain Bonanza continued throughout my 3-day stint in Siem Reap . The $40 I dropped on a 3-day pass to Angkor Wat was offset by just how far $5 could get me in town . And Cambodia uses US dollars as currency for most everything , so when I say $5 , I do n't mean *around* $5 I mean EXACTLY $5 ! <p> And with that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reap , Cambodia : <h> Single Hotel Room <p> I booked a room at the Palm Garden Lodge , based on its stellar reviews and dirt cheap prices . A sizable single room with a double bed , mosquito net , fan , tv , fridge , and en suite bathroom was mine for just $5 . As if that were n't enough bang for your buck , they also provide a complementary breakfast ( fried egg , toast , tea/coffee ) . This same room would go for $150+ in NYC. <h> 1-Hour Foot Massage <p> For some reason , Siem Reap is chock full of spas offering all sorts of massages and hair/nail care . In the night market and on/near Pub Street , you 'll find no shortage of $5 spa services . I opted for a 1-hour foot massage , which was more of a relaxing massage than the *tough love* semi-painful massages I tend to prefer , but it was still nice ( except for the part where the girl did some shoddy reflexology by tapping a stick on the various pressure points that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage would go for $60+ in NYC ( unless perhaps you hit up Chinatown ) . <p> Alternative spa adventure : Manicure or pedicure ( $4-5 ) <h> Dinner and Drinks <p> My very first night in town , I came upon a restaurant with ridiculously affordable main courses and a mojito happy hour special . And , bonus ! they served a complementary fruit plate for dessert . Main course , mojito , and fruit plate came to exactly $5 . The next night , I found a different restaurant where a main course , appetizer , and fruit shake came to $5.50 . These same meals would easily go for $20+ in NYC . <p> Note : Cost of living is a bit higher in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville , where these same adventures would cost around $7. 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118793373 @7793373/ <h> NYC Has Fall Foliage , Too ! <p> I feel like a common misconception about NYC is that its got ZERO nature . True , the concrete-to-tree ratio is objectively depressing for the outdoor enthusiast , but the city has prioritized going green in recent years : from dedicated bike lanes to the random green spaces scattered about to new pedestrian paths like the High Line and the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway . In total , there are over 1700 parks and recreation facilities across New York City who knew ? <p> In other words : New York has plenty of opportunities for outdoor adventures . How else would I have lasted 7 years here ? <p> One of my favorite local outdoor adventures is catching the NYC fall foliage each year . From early to mid-November , what trees it has explode in color . Its parks and even some of its tree-lined streets become a blur of orange and yellow . While its fun to escape for some fall activities ( for example : Storm King Art Center , The Great Jack-O-Lantern Blaze ) , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City ! <h> Fall Foliage in Central Park <p> Fall is a crazy-popular time for weddings in NYC . With moderate weather and plentiful foliage , its totally understandable why this would be . October was my busiest shooting month this year , but I loved every bit of it ! My favorite wedding was hands-down the NYC elopement I shot just as the leaves were starting to turn in late October . Having a bright yellow blurred foliage backdrop behind the brides white wedding dress was just FANTASTIC . <p> I took this Central Park foliage photo at least 5 years ago , but I love the colors so much that I had it printed on a canvas that still hangs in my bedroom . I 've never seen Central Park this colorful since then ! <p> I 'm not sure if there 's a science to this , but I 've noticed that the NYC fall foliage is more yellow than anything else . I 've never seen the trees at The Mall anything other than green or yellow . <p> When I 'm leaf peeping , I always try to stop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of the foliage on the water . This year , my first attempt was on a very windy day ( see the first photo below ) i.e. no still water to reflect the trees . My next attempt proved more fruitful , both in weather conditions and level of foliage ( see the 3 photos after the first one below ) . <p> Bethesda Fountain and the Central Park Boathouse are super touristic , but you cant NOT pay them a visit , at least every once in awhile preferably when the trees are looking like this ! <h> Fall Foliage in Brooklyn <p> One of the more appealing aspects to Brooklyn is that it offers more space , resulting in larger apartments , and gasp ! more outdoor space . Frolicking is a lot more enjoyable when you 're ambling down a street lined with trees and little gardens , specifically when the trees have donned their autumnal coloring . <p> Prospect Park is Brooklyns answer to Central Park . It is significantly less crowded , which automatically earns it extra points in my book . One year I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pond <p> And finally , I 'd be remiss not to include some fall foliage from my local park , McGolrick Park , in Greenpoint . <h> Wheres your favorite spot to catch NYC fall foliage ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Once again , amazing photos .

I 'm pretty bad about leaf peeping in my own borough , and have only been to Prospect Park twice in 7 years during fall .

@@118793375 @7793375/ <h> The Definitive Guide to Christmas in New York <p> My undying love for the Christmas season will forever be one of life 's unsolved mysteries . For someone who considers herself nonreligious and nontraditional , it 's downright remarkable how devoted I am to this holiday . No matter where I am , I 'll always spend these 4-5 weeks of the year listening to Mariah Carey and NSYNC Christmas songs , drinking spiced cider and mulled wine , and watching Love Actually and Home Alone 2 . It just never gets old . <p> BUT I 'm in New York City . Clearly there 's more to the Christmas season than watching movies and drinking . And with 5 ( soon to be 6 ) holiday seasons under my belt here , I feel like I 've got reasonable authority on what to do in New York for the holidays . <p> Much like everything else in New York , you can go all out and splurge on your Christmas experience here , or you can do more offbeat Christmas activities without spending much ( if anything ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great come to New York for the day ( or weekend ) , see the Rockettes , take a carriage ride around Central Park , shop til you drop on 5th Ave , grab a $10 hot chocolate at Serendipity because Oprah said so , and eat a fancy dinner somewhere in Midtown . No judgment here this was what Christmas in NYC was to me before I moved here , and its a fun time . <p> But as a New Yorker and a frugal frolicker , my New York Christmas looks a lot different these days . My December is always filled with affordable offbeat holiday activities ; each year I add more to my ever-growing list , which I 've finally decided to put on ( virtual ) paper for others to enjoy as well ! <p> With that , I present you with The Definitive Guide to Christmas in New York City ! <p> Snowflakes at Saks <p> Midtown <h> Holiday Decorations and Displays <p> In 5 years worth of thorough Christmas season wanderings in NYC , I 've checked out all sorts of holiday displays around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I not done my research and intentionally sought them out . Involving much frolicking and zero spending , wandering around to check out the myriad Christmas decorations in NYC is a frugal frolickers delight . <p> This is by no means complete , but here is an extensive list of holiday displays in NYC worth checking out : <p> Window displays on 5th Avenue From approx. 34th-59th St , you could spend an evening contentedly window shopping without the need to pull out your wallet <p> Nostalgia Train The M line runs old trains from the 1930-70s on the first 4 Sundays in December . You can catch this vintage subway from 10am-5pm ( as I accidentally did last year ) . <p> St. Patrick 's Cathedral <p> Snowflakes at the Time Warner Center <p> Gingerbread art at Le Parker Meridien <p> Nostalgia Subway Train ; Holiday Train Show <p> St. Patricks Cathedral <h> Christmas Tree Lightings <p> The Rockefeller Center tree lighting is far and away the most famous lighting ceremony in New York and the most crowded . Complete with musical performances and a live broadcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed like sardines in the freezing cold is not your bag , there are other lesser-known tree lighting ceremonies that happen the week following Thanksgiving , on weeknights : <p> South Street Seaport <p> Madison Square Park <p> Rockefeller Center <p> Bryant Park <p> South Street Seaport tree lighting <p> Madison Square Park <h> Tuba Christmas <p> All over the country , regional groups of tuba players assemble annually to perform holiday music . Nothing but tubas ; nothing but Christmas tunes . Maybe it 's the band geek in me , but Tuba Christmas never fails to give me goosebumps . <p> Tuba Christmas at Rockefeller Center <p> Tuba Christmas is fast becoming my favorite Christmas activity in the city . Being smack in the middle of the Rockefeller Center skating rink , it 's got that distinct New York feel to it ; and while there will be plenty of spectators , it 's hardly crowded by New York standards . Most people who are there to watch are either the families of the performers , or just random passers-by who happened to be in the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and intentionally sought out the event out of pure love for tubas and/or Christmas . Regardless , it 's not a touristy event , which I think makes it feel more special . <p> NYC 's Tuba Christmas is typically on a Sunday afternoon in mid-December . <h> SantaCon <p> Best explained on the event 's website , " Santacon is a charitable , non-commercial , non-political , nonsensical Santa Claus convention that happens once a year for absolutely no reason . " <p> Picture hundreds ( thousands ? ) of loonies dressed as some variation of Santa or other associated characters , descending on New York City at the same time . This is SantaCon . There is no set route map ; there are no rules . There is , however , plenty of drinking and other shenanigans . While the vast majority of SantaConners are some variation of Santa or elf , I 've also seen people dressed as wrapped presents , polar bears , and Christmas trees . Its so much fun to see how creative people get with their costumes ! <p> For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the night before . You can follow the official twitter handle or the website , where each meetup location is announced in real time , and then make your way from spot-to-spot with hoards of other Santas . SantaCon is very deliberate in not wanting to be called a bar crawl , though most of the meetup locations are in fact at bars ; either way , Santas will be drinking all day , whether in bars or by flask . <p> At SantaCon <p> For those who would rather do their own thing , you 're pretty much guaranteed to bump into the madness at some point . While SantaCon may make its way through any of the 5 boroughs , in the last 5 years I have ALWAYS seen it go through both Manhattan and Brooklyn . Best bet for wanting to run into the Santa crowd would be to hang out south of Union Square , around the East or West Village . <p> SantaCon takes place on a Saturday in mid-December , starting at 10am . <h> Dyker Heights Christmas Lights <p> Fortunately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too popular , as this neighborhood is located pretty deep into Brooklyn and well off the tourist trail . Take the subway to southern Brooklyn and you 're transported to land where nice houses with yards and garages exist in New York City ! I think it must be an unspoken rule where if you live in this part of Dyker Heights , you 're obligated to deck your house and yard out with Christmas lights each year . Its literally house after house of extravagant light displays , inflatable characters , and Christmas music . Many of the displays are professionally done ; all are silently competing with each other . <p> The best way to do the Dyker Heights Christmas lights is to hop on the train with some friends and a thermos of hot cider and make a night of it . Take the D or M train to 79th St or the R to 86th St and tour the area on foot . Most of the lights are between 83-86th St and 11-13th Ave . Best of all : its FREE ! <h> Holiday Markets <p> Admittedly I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually handmade or purchased during my travels but if I were , I would totally hit up the seasonal markets over retail chains in New York City . Theyre comprised of vendors selling unique handmade crafts such as jewelry , winter accessories , soaps , and stationary . <p> Operating from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve ( and sometimes beyond ) , you can find the following holiday markets around the city : <p> There are a handful of other markets that are open for just one weekend during the season . I always like checking these out because they often have different items than the regularly-operating markets . Unfortunately , the price tags tend to match the level of uniqueness offered , so its best to walk in with a finite amount of cash and no cards on you . Trust me on this ! <p> Renegade Craft Fair Brooklyn . Nov 23-24 , 2013 . I used to love this fair when it was held in the summer in Williamsburg , but crowds and prices have inflated in recent years . <p> Bust Craftacular Chelsea . Dec 14-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think Ive ever bought anything from it . <p> Degenerate Craft Fair Chinatown . Dec 14-15 , 2013 . Pegged as the " anti-craft fair " , I 'm eager to check this one out for the first time ! <p> Renegade Craft Fair <h> Ice Skating <p> Its to be expected that one who hates the cold and has poor balance would not take to ice skating , so I do not speak with authority when it comes to ice skating in New York . I have n't stepped foot on a rink since one of our last family outings to NYC 10 years ago , where my sisters and I skated at Wollman Rink in Central Park ( you know , the one from Home Alone 2 ) . I remember I was triumphantly about to complete one crawling lap around the rink when some jerk crashed into me and knocked me down . I took that as a sign that I was right to stay off skates and havent skated since . <p> But ice skating is gaining popularity here , with a few new rinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the list below ) . If you want to shell out a small fortune and wrestle the crowds of tourists at the Rockefeller and Wollman rinks , you can have your quintessential *Ice Skating in NYC* experience ; but if you 're just looking to skate without the glitz and hype , there are plenty of other less-popular and more affordable rinks . <h> Any other New York Christmas attractions to add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793395 @7793395/ <h> The Definitive Guide to Christmas in New York <p> My undying love for the Christmas season will forever be one of life 's unsolved mysteries . For someone who considers herself nonreligious and nontraditional , it 's downright remarkable how devoted I am to this holiday . No matter where I am , I 'll always spend these 4-5 weeks of the year listening to Mariah Carey and NSYNC Christmas songs , drinking spiced cider and mulled wine , and watching Love Actually and Home Alone 2 . It just never gets old . <p> BUT I 'm in New York City . Clearly there 's more to the Christmas season than watching movies and drinking . And with 5 ( soon to be 6 ) holiday seasons under my belt here , I feel like I 've got reasonable authority on what to do in New York for the holidays . <p> Much like everything else in New York , you can go all out and splurge on your Christmas experience here , or you can do more offbeat Christmas activities without spending much ( if anything ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great come to New York for the day ( or weekend ) , see the Rockettes , take a carriage ride around Central Park , shop til you drop on 5th Ave , grab a $10 hot chocolate at Serendipity because Oprah said so , and eat a fancy dinner somewhere in Midtown . No judgment here this was what Christmas in NYC was to me before I moved here , and its a fun time . <p> But as a New Yorker and a frugal frolicker , my New York Christmas looks a lot different these days . My December is always filled with affordable offbeat holiday activities ; each year I add more to my ever-growing list , which I 've finally decided to put on ( virtual ) paper for others to enjoy as well ! <p> With that , I present you with The Definitive Guide to Christmas in New York City ! <p> Snowflakes at Saks <p> Midtown <h> Holiday Decorations and Displays <p> In 5 years worth of thorough Christmas season wanderings in NYC , I 've checked out all sorts of holiday displays around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I not done my research and intentionally sought them out . Involving much frolicking and zero spending , wandering around to check out the myriad Christmas decorations in NYC is a frugal frolickers delight . <p> This is by no means complete , but here is an extensive list of holiday displays in NYC worth checking out : <p> Window displays on 5th Avenue From approx. 34th-59th St , you could spend an evening contentedly window shopping without the need to pull out your wallet <p> Nostalgia Train The M line runs old trains from the 1930-70s on the first 4 Sundays in December . You can catch this vintage subway from 10am-5pm ( as I accidentally did last year ) . <p> St. Patrick 's Cathedral <p> Snowflakes at the Time Warner Center <p> Gingerbread art at Le Parker Meridien <p> Nostalgia Subway Train ; Holiday Train Show <p> St. Patricks Cathedral <h> Christmas Tree Lightings <p> The Rockefeller Center tree lighting is far and away the most famous lighting ceremony in New York and the most crowded . Complete with musical performances and a live broadcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed like sardines in the freezing cold is not your bag , there are other lesser-known tree lighting ceremonies that happen the week following Thanksgiving , on weeknights : <p> South Street Seaport <p> Madison Square Park <p> Rockefeller Center <p> Bryant Park <p> South Street Seaport tree lighting <p> Madison Square Park <h> Tuba Christmas <p> All over the country , regional groups of tuba players assemble annually to perform holiday music . Nothing but tubas ; nothing but Christmas tunes . Maybe it 's the band geek in me , but Tuba Christmas never fails to give me goosebumps . <p> Tuba Christmas at Rockefeller Center <p> Tuba Christmas is fast becoming my favorite Christmas activity in the city . Being smack in the middle of the Rockefeller Center skating rink , it 's got that distinct New York feel to it ; and while there will be plenty of spectators , it 's hardly crowded by New York standards . Most people who are there to watch are either the families of the performers , or just random passers-by who happened to be in the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and intentionally sought out the event out of pure love for tubas and/or Christmas . Regardless , it 's not a touristy event , which I think makes it feel more special . <p> NYC 's Tuba Christmas is typically on a Sunday afternoon in mid-December . <h> SantaCon <p> Best explained on the event 's website , " Santacon is a charitable , non-commercial , non-political , nonsensical Santa Claus convention that happens once a year for absolutely no reason . " <p> Picture hundreds ( thousands ? ) of loonies dressed as some variation of Santa or other associated characters , descending on New York City at the same time . This is SantaCon . There is no set route map ; there are no rules . There is , however , plenty of drinking and other shenanigans . While the vast majority of SantaConners are some variation of Santa or elf , I 've also seen people dressed as wrapped presents , polar bears , and Christmas trees . Its so much fun to see how creative people get with their costumes ! <p> For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the night before . You can follow the official twitter handle or the website , where each meetup location is announced in real time , and then make your way from spot-to-spot with hoards of other Santas . SantaCon is very deliberate in not wanting to be called a bar crawl , though most of the meetup locations are in fact at bars ; either way , Santas will be drinking all day , whether in bars or by flask . <p> At SantaCon <p> For those who would rather do their own thing , you 're pretty much guaranteed to bump into the madness at some point . While SantaCon may make its way through any of the 5 boroughs , in the last 5 years I have ALWAYS seen it go through both Manhattan and Brooklyn . Best bet for wanting to run into the Santa crowd would be to hang out south of Union Square , around the East or West Village . <p> SantaCon takes place on a Saturday in mid-December , starting at 10am . <h> Dyker Heights Christmas Lights <p> Fortunately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too popular , as this neighborhood is located pretty deep into Brooklyn and well off the tourist trail . Take the subway to southern Brooklyn and you 're transported to land where nice houses with yards and garages exist in New York City ! I think it must be an unspoken rule where if you live in this part of Dyker Heights , you 're obligated to deck your house and yard out with Christmas lights each year . Its literally house after house of extravagant light displays , inflatable characters , and Christmas music . Many of the displays are professionally done ; all are silently competing with each other . <p> The best way to do the Dyker Heights Christmas lights is to hop on the train with some friends and a thermos of hot cider and make a night of it . Take the D or M train to 79th St or the R to 86th St and tour the area on foot . Most of the lights are between 83-86th St and 11-13th Ave . Best of all : its FREE ! <h> Holiday Markets <p> Admittedly I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually handmade or purchased during my travels but if I were , I would totally hit up the seasonal markets over retail chains in New York City . Theyre comprised of vendors selling unique handmade crafts such as jewelry , winter accessories , soaps , and stationary . <p> Operating from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve ( and sometimes beyond ) , you can find the following holiday markets around the city : <p> There are a handful of other markets that are open for just one weekend during the season . I always like checking these out because they often have different items than the regularly-operating markets . Unfortunately , the price tags tend to match the level of uniqueness offered , so its best to walk in with a finite amount of cash and no cards on you . Trust me on this ! <p> Renegade Craft Fair Brooklyn . Nov 23-24 , 2013 . I used to love this fair when it was held in the summer in Williamsburg , but crowds and prices have inflated in recent years . <p> Bust Craftacular Chelsea . Dec 14-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think Ive ever bought anything from it . <p> Degenerate Craft Fair Chinatown . Dec 14-15 , 2013 . Pegged as the " anti-craft fair " , I 'm eager to check this one out for the first time ! <p> Renegade Craft Fair <h> Ice Skating <p> Its to be expected that one who hates the cold and has poor balance would not take to ice skating , so I do not speak with authority when it comes to ice skating in New York . I have n't stepped foot on a rink since one of our last family outings to NYC 10 years ago , where my sisters and I skated at Wollman Rink in Central Park ( you know , the one from Home Alone 2 ) . I remember I was triumphantly about to complete one crawling lap around the rink when some jerk crashed into me and knocked me down . I took that as a sign that I was right to stay off skates and havent skated since . <p> But ice skating is gaining popularity here , with a few new rinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the list below ) . If you want to shell out a small fortune and wrestle the crowds of tourists at the Rockefeller and Wollman rinks , you can have your quintessential *Ice Skating in NYC* experience ; but if you 're just looking to skate without the glitz and hype , there are plenty of other less-popular and more affordable rinks . <h> Any other New York Christmas attractions to add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

@@118793401 @7793401/ <h> Falling Out Of Love With New York <p> On January 1 , New York and I celebrated our 6 year anniversary . Except , unlike previous years , it did n't  feel like much of a celebration . I was n't happily toasting to another year of living in New York City I was wondering how many more years I 'd be ringing in here , and what would come next . <p> It was n't always like this . During my first few years living here , I 'd regularly bring my camera and tripod with me to work , then set off into the city afterwards to photograph the bridges and skyline at night . On weekends , I 'd set out to frolic new neighborhoods or drag my roommate to hipster fashion shows and burlesque birthday parties . And whenever I left the city , the sight of the skyline upon my return always excited me . My enthusiasm for New York seemed to know no bounds . <p> So in recent years , when I started spending most of my weekends hanging around indoors or confined to my Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't love New York anymore . <p> I ca n't point to anything in particular that may have triggered this sudden change in feelings , or even the moment where I realized we were done but it happened sometime in 2012 , my 5th year of living here . I was fed up with pretty much everything in my life , especially my job , and by the year 's end I had given my notice and booked my flight to Kathmandu . I figured nearly 6 months of traveling in 2013 would give me a much-needed break from New York and hopefully some clarity on The Next Step . <p> I was waiting on an epiphany that never came . <p> Upon my return last summer , I did n't know what to do or where to go so I did the easiest , safest thing and stayed put in New York . I quickly found a new job in the city and jumped back into a familiar routine : the same commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan via the L Train , the same pseudo-Polish grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats . <p> Everything was the same again , so why did I think it would be better this time around ? <p> To my credit , I 've lined up plenty of new things to distract me from the same old : a job I enjoy , Crossfit , this travel blog , weddings to photograph . All of these things are both invigorating and demoralizing at times just like New York is . The truth is , they 're not enough to keep me content here . I feel so restless in one of the greatest , most exciting cities in the world . There are people out there who would give up their first born for the opportunity to live in New York , and here I am complaining about the people , the traffic , the weather . It 's not that I 'm ungrateful it 's that New York and I have grown apart . We 're not meant to be together anymore , but we 're still hanging on out of obligation out of convenience . <p> This fading relationship is holding me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : Since I 've known for awhile that I do n't want to stay in NYC much longer , I 've been holding off on doing a lot of things that would greatly enhance my life . I desperately want my own apartment , preferably with an outdoor space but why waste money and effort on moving and sign a lease when I hope to be leaving the city soon ? I have n't booked many weddings because I do n't know where I 'll be next year and do n't want to commit to being in New York to shoot them . And why even bother seriously dating anyone in NYC knowing the end is nigh ? If I do any of these things , I 'm setting heavy anchors that I do n't want here ; if I DO N'T do these things , I 'm not truly living my life the way I want to . <p> It 's clear that I need to leave New York City .

@@118793405 @7793405/ <h> A Few Thoughts On New Zealand <p> I recently spent 3 weeks on New Zealand 's south island . I could have easily been tempted to spend that time trying to explore the entire country , or at least all of the south island , but instead I focused on just the central part of the island around Queenstown , Wanaka , and Mt . Cook . <p> This trip was n't about vacationing ; it was about immersing myself in the Kiwi life and waking up to the mountains every day . Getting a feel for what it 's like to live in New Zealand appealed to me more than trying to cram as many sights and activities as possible into my 3 weeks there . I also had to put in about 20 hours of work a week , which meant ensuring I had access to wifi and a decent working environment more often than not . I bookended any days spent camping or hiking off the grid with well-connected off days . <p> At first I felt like I was n't doing much and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but when all was said and done : I climbed 3 mountains , took a scenic flight , went SUP-ing , cruised Milford Sound , and went on a few epic bike rides . I 'd say that 's plenty of outdoor adventures , right ? <p> Lake Tekapo . <p> Anyhow , I found myself accumulating all sorts of observations , thoughts , conclusions , and facts during my time in New Zealand , stuff that probably would n't make its way into any other blog post but is still worth highlighting in case any of you are considering traveling to or living in NZ . <h> American accents everywhere <p> File this one under Things I Was n't Expecting . One thing I love very much about Australia is how infrequently I hear someone else speaking my same dopey accent . Somehow it makes me feel more exotic , more special and who does n't want that ? <p> But traveling in New Zealand , at times it felt like my fellow Americans were the majority . I 've got a few hypotheses as to why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thoughts on why there seem to be many more Americans in NZ than in Australia so feel free to comment below ! <p> One of the better coffees I had , in Greymouth . <h> Sorry Kiwis , your coffee is n't as good as you think <p> If there 's anything I know well , it 's coffee . I was eager to sample copious flat whites throughout my NZ travels ( you know , purely for research purposes ) , but I was largely disappointed by the coffee in New Zealand . Which would have been fine if I had n't had such high expectations based on what I 'd heard about it beforehand . <p> But now that I 've thoroughly sampled coffee around the south island , I 'm utterly baffled as to how this claim was made . Even the good cups I had leaned more toward the bitter end of the scale . Maybe the north island is where the good coffee 's at ? Wellington , I 'm coming for you next time ! <p> Sunrise at Mt Cook . <h> Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand was categorically The Worst I 've ever experienced on my travels , I had a surprisingly positive experience with Vodafone of all carriers ( in Australia , they are not-so-lovingly referred to as Vodafail ) . I popped into a random electronics store early in my trip and picked up the Vodafone Travel SIM . For NZ$49 ( about US$31 ) , I got a one-month plan with 3gb of data and more than enough texts and minutes to contact others in NZ , Australia , and the US . I found I had good service in most every town I visited , even Mt . Cook village but while on the bus between towns , there was no service at all . <p> I nearly managed to use up all of the data in my 3 weeks there because I used it to get online on my laptop whenever I did n't have decent wifi . One of my favorite digital nomad hacks is turning my iPhone into a personal hotspot and connecting to it via my laptop . It 's the perfect solution for working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that charge you to use their ( epically slow ) wifi .

Go to New Zealand <p> I 've watched other instagram accounts go from average to booming once they started posting photos of the glorious NZ scenery , and I noticed a similar gain in followers as I began doing the same . Call it the New Zealand Effect . <p> Milford Sound . <h> As Beautiful As NZ Is I 'm An Aussie Girl <p> While I was hanging out in New Zealand , I tried to imagine myself living there with the mountains on my doorstep . I love the idea of having epic trails just minutes away , making it easy for me to get my hiking and cycling fixes on the reg . And I 'd have the opportunity to dabble in just about any other outdoor activity imaginable : mountain biking , stand-up paddleboarding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest ) . <p> But the one thing New Zealand ( specifically most every south island town ) lacks is the thing that trumps all else for me : BEACHES . I 'd miss the beach too much if I lived in landlocked Queenstown or Wanaka . So if nothing else , this trip confirmed that I made the right decision in foregoing a year on the NZ working holiday visa in favor of a year living on the edge on the Australian tourist visa . What can I say , Australia has my heart . <p> Hiking to the Ben Lomond summit . <h> NZ Hostels Get Booked Up Fast <p> I do n't know if this is the norm throughout New Zealand , but in several of the south island towns I visited you 'd be screwed if you decided to rock up to a hostel without a booking . New Zealand is very popular amongst backpackers and young travelers , and there are n't nearly enough budget accommodation options for them all . I found Queenstown to be the worst of all : this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall , so what happens is the working holiday folks either ca n't afford to pay rent on a proper apartment or just have trouble securing permanent housing for a short-term stint . So they end up living at the hostels in town , usually working there in exchange for a free bed . This would be fine if they were n't taking up beds that proper travelers could be booking instead , or constantly taking over tables and common areas in the hostel with their fellow long-term stayers . <p> My week in Queenstown entailed a little game of musical chairs ( or beds ) : I had to camp for a few nights when there were no free hostel beds in town , then I had to shuffle between different rooms and hostels for the remainder of my time there . Totally avoidable had I booked way ahead of time , but ah well lesson learned ! <p> I 've heard that this is normal for Queenstown year-round , but other towns only book up at certain times in the year .

Cook hostels with availability , and Wanaka hostels with availability before the Warbirds Over Wanaka Easter weekend event . Your mileage may vary . <p> Road to Mt . Cook . <h> No Freedom Camping For Tents <p> I was really disappointed to find that my options were extremely limited for where I could pitch my tent in NZ . Freedom camping is restricted to certain areas in New Zealand , and usually only campers with self-contained vehicles are allowed to camp where they please i.e. no tents allowed . What this means is that if you want to pitch a tent and camp in New Zealand , you typically can only do so on DOC campsites or in caravan parks . The DOC sites are more basic and immersed in nature , but you generally need a car to access them . Since I was traveling NZ by bus , I was limited to town caravan parks . It was beyond frustrating to have to pay $25/night just for a tiny plot of land squeezed between other tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want or need like proper bathroom blocks , laundry facilities , and kitchens . All I wanted to do was be alone with my tent and nature ! <p> Someone river surfing near Wanaka . <h> Traveling NZ By Bus Is Doable , But Not Ideal <p> If you 're a solo traveler on a budget ( and/or shit-scared of driving on the left side of the road like I am ) , you can still travel New Zealand by bus . There are several bus companies that run between most towns and tourist attractions , so you can get around each island easily . The obvious downside is that you 're limited to doing things in or very close to town unless you join a tour or hitchhike . <p> On that note , it is so much better if you have a car to travel around New Zealand . Not only are you able to pull off and sleep in your car ( or better yet campervan ) most anywhere freedom camping is allowed , but you 're also able to veer off the main roads and away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so many hikes I wanted to do but could n't because I had no reliable/affordable way of getting to the trailhead . It killed me that I did n't have as much freedom as I could have , had I been roadtripping New Zealand . <p> Next time I visit NZ , I 'm vowing to rent a car or campervan so that I expand my options for camping and exploring . Who 's with me ? <p> Cycling Queenstown . <h> The Queenstown vs . Wanaka Debate <p> I 'd fully expected to join Team Wanaka after all I 'd heard about this little town that gladly plays second fiddle to Queenstown . For whatever reason I just was n't feeling it , though . I loved paddle boarding on and walking around Lake Wanaka , hiking to Roy 's Peak , and cycling the Hawea River Trail , but I did n't love the town of Wanaka itself . It felt too quiet and too rife with ( North American ) expats to charm me . <p> Queenstown took me by surprise , though . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents are foreigners or displaced Kiwis ( i.e. they come from elsewhere in NZ ) who work in tourism or hospitality . But can you blame them ? Queenstown is freakin ' beautiful and has the most accessible outdoor adventures of any place I 've ever visited ( or even heard about ! ) . I would n't classify Queenstown as a proper city , but it sure feels like one compared to Wanaka and consequently has more options for dining , drinking , and adventuring . Yup , consider me on Team Queenstown . <p> Lake Wanaka . <h> Watch Out For The Weather <p> With all the postcard-worthy photos plastered all over the internet , it 's easy to overlook that New Zealand is known as the land of the long white cloud . The weather does not always cooperate in this part of the world , and the landscapes do n't always look as magnificent as they do on picture-perfect clear days . I 'd say it rained at least half of the time during my NZ trip : partly because I was traveling in early autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the El Nino effect ( say the Kiwis ) . I was very glad to have allotted plenty of time in each place I visited , which was usually enough to give me at least a couple of semi-clear days to enjoy . <p> Wanaka sunset . <h> As Usual , Lifestyle Trumps Adrenaline <p> I could have jumped off a ledge , soared over a lake , or raced down a river , but what did I do instead in New Zealand ? I hiked and biked , the same things I do at home and try to do wherever I travel . These things always bring me joy and provide a full day of adventure , and I 'm the kind of girl who tends to opt for those guaranteed hits of happiness . When I find something I like , I stick with it . So really , I guess it 's not surprising that I opted to skip the short-lived thrills that all the popular adrenaline activities in New Zealand provide . If I 'd had more time ( and , er , money ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorites take priority . I would n't change a thing ! <h> How Much Does Traveling NZ Cost ? <p> And because no Frugal Frolicker trip recap is complete without some mention of money , I spent a grand total of US$1541 on 3 weeks of travel in New Zealand . My return flight from Sydney was about $300 , and my average spend per day excluding flights was US$59/day . For such a pricey destination , I 'm pretty happy with my expenditure . <h> What do you think about New Zealand ? If you 've been , anything to add to this random thought list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> Petra <p> A Kiwi here Its a shame you did n't  get to visit the North Island that 's where you 'll find the best beaches ( Northland , Auckland , Coromandel , Bay of Plenty ) and the best coffee ( Auckland and Wellington ) . Wifi is average in places , but its not bad at all compared to some other countries ( have you been to the Pacific Islands ? ! ) . Agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you 're into hiking/camping etc . Definitely get a car/campervan next time ( driving on the wrong side of the road is n't that scary ! ) . And regarding freedom camping , its a good thing that you have to be in a self-contained vehicle to freedom camp so many travellers sleeping in their cars crap all over the ground and leave rubbish everywhere , so that 's one rule that I most definitely support ! ! Hope you come back to our beautiful country and explore a bit more : ) <p> Hey there ! I do agree re : freedom camping I totally understand the reasoning behind it , just a shame that some lazy folks had to spoil it for us considerate campers : ( <p> And word I 'd heard the north had the better coffee and beaches . Sounds like I 'll be making a dedicated trip there at some point ! Knowing my very specific interests , its kind of strange that I opted for the south island instead guess I just wanted a taste of something different ! <p> Katie Bell <p> The North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ! I think you just had bad luck with the weather . NZ has an undeserved rep for bad weather just like Australia has an undeserved rep for good weather all the time the truth is somewhere in between for both countries . <p> Bahaha , somehow that does n't  surprise me ! Maybe the trick is to always go to absurdly beautiful places and instagram the bejesus out of them ! : P <p> Lindsay <p> Hi ! Loved reading through this post as I am also an American who has been living and exploring New Zealand for a year now . Interesting you say there are many Americans here , as I have only ran into a handful over my year here ! Three weeks being such a short time span and possibly just by chance you ran into quiet a few Americans ? Queenstown/Wanaka area are also both HUGE tourist areas and when I 've made trips down that way I have met people from all over . Also wanted to not discourage anyone looking for a beach to not travel to New Zealand . If beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south island is , of course , not where to go . Come up to north island , google " Cathedral Cove " " Ninety Mile Beach " or " Raglan " . I 'd beg to differ in that I truly believe New Zealand has some serious gorgeous beaches ! ! ( And this is coming from a born and raised Californian ) . Coffee was another interesting one . I 've had visitors from all over and everyone seems obsessed with the coffee here . AnywhooooJust do n't  want to discourage anyone from a trip to New Zealand from this post ! ! Maybe more than 3 weeks was needed to get a better grasp of what kiwi life is truly about . Cheers : ) <p> Hey there ! Yep , you 're spot-on re : beaches and coffee ( as discussed in previous comments ) . I think the North Island does these things better ! I did n't  go to the south island for the beaches , but I DID expect to find better coffee than I did there so that was a little disappointing . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seriously . Probably had something to do with it being around Easter when study abroad students probably decided to do some traveling around . I also took the bus regularly to get between towns , plenty of Americans on those . But what surprised me the most is how many Americans I encountered working here . I guess it kinda makes sense that they would want to work in Wanaka and Queenstown of all NZ towns , but I just was n't expecting it ! 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

It just never gets old . <p> BUT I 'm in New York City . Clearly there 's more to the Christmas season than watching movies and drinking . And with 5 ( soon to be 6 ) holiday seasons under my belt here , I feel like I 've got reasonable authority on what to do in New York for the holidays . <p> Much like everything else in New York , you can go all out and splurge on your Christmas experience here , or you can do more offbeat Christmas activities without spending much ( if anything ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great come to New York for the day ( or weekend ) , see the Rockettes , take a carriage ride around Central Park , shop til you drop on 5th Ave , grab a $10 hot chocolate at Serendipity because Oprah said so , and eat a fancy dinner somewhere in Midtown .

Nothing but tubas ; nothing but Christmas tunes . Maybe it 's the band geek in me , but Tuba Christmas never fails to give me goosebumps . <p> Tuba Christmas at Rockefeller Center <p> Tuba Christmas is fast becoming my favorite Christmas activity in the city . Being smack in the middle of the Rockefeller Center skating rink , it 's got that distinct New York feel to it ; and while there will be plenty of spectators , it 's hardly crowded by New York standards .

Regardless , it 's not a touristy event , which I think makes it feel more special . <p> NYC 's Tuba Christmas is typically on a Sunday afternoon in mid-December . <h> SantaCon <p> Best explained on the event 's website , " Santacon is a charitable , non-commercial , non-political , nonsensical Santa Claus convention that happens once a year for absolutely no reason . " <p> Picture hundreds ( thousands ? ) of loonies dressed as some variation of Santa or other associated characters , descending on New York City at the same time . This is SantaCon . There is no set route map ; there are no rules . There is , however , plenty of drinking and other shenanigans . While the vast majority of SantaConners are some variation of Santa or elf , I 've also seen people dressed as wrapped presents , polar bears , and Christmas trees . Its so much fun to see how creative people get with their costumes ! <p> For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the night before . You can follow the official twitter handle or the website , where each meetup location is announced in real time , and then make your way from spot-to-spot with hoards of other Santas . SantaCon is very deliberate in not wanting to be called a bar crawl , though most of the meetup locations are in fact at bars ; either way , Santas will be drinking all day , whether in bars or by flask . <p> At SantaCon <p> For those who would rather do their own thing , you 're pretty much guaranteed to bump into the madness at some point . While SantaCon may make its way through any of the 5 boroughs , in the last 5 years I have ALWAYS seen it go through both Manhattan and Brooklyn . Best bet for wanting to run into the Santa crowd would be to hang out south of Union Square , around the East or West Village . <p> SantaCon takes place on a Saturday in mid-December , starting at 10am . <h> Dyker Heights Christmas Lights <p> Fortunately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too popular , as this neighborhood is located pretty deep into Brooklyn and well off the tourist trail . Take the subway to southern Brooklyn and you 're transported to land where nice houses with yards and garages exist in New York City ! I think it must be an unspoken rule where if you live in this part of Dyker Heights , you 're obligated to deck your house and yard out with Christmas lights each year . Its literally house after house of extravagant light displays , inflatable characters , and Christmas music . Many of the displays are professionally done ; all are silently competing with each other . <p> The best way to do the Dyker Heights Christmas lights is to hop on the train with some friends and a thermos of hot cider and make a night of it . Take the D or M train to 79th St or the R to 86th St and tour the area on foot . Most of the lights are between 83-86th St and 11-13th Ave .

I always like checking these out because they often have different items than the regularly-operating markets . Unfortunately , the price tags tend to match the level of uniqueness offered , so its best to walk in with a finite amount of cash and no cards on you .

I have n't stepped foot on a rink since one of our last family outings to NYC 10 years ago , where my sisters and I skated at Wollman Rink in Central Park ( you know , the one from Home Alone 2 ) . I remember I was triumphantly about to complete one crawling lap around the rink when some jerk crashed into me and knocked me down . I took that as a sign that I was right to stay off skates and havent skated since . <p> But ice skating is gaining popularity here , with a few new rinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the list below ) . If you want to shell out a small fortune and wrestle the crowds of tourists at the Rockefeller and Wollman rinks , you can have your quintessential *Ice Skating in NYC* experience ; but if you 're just looking to skate without the glitz and hype , there are plenty of other less-popular and more affordable rinks . <h> Any other New York Christmas attractions to add to this list ? 205744 @qwx1065744 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747 
@@118793422 @7793422/ <h> Zion National Park // FLASHBACK FRIDAY <p> In month #9 of my ( f ) unemployment stint and quarter-life crisis , I was as restless as I 'd ever been . I had all this time at my disposal , and all I 'd done with it was start my wedding photography business and apply for jobs . Winter was dragging on , I did n't  know what I was doing with my life , etc etc . All I knew was that I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING . <p> So I sought the only cure I knew : travel . In April 2010 , I took a spontaneous trip out west , flew into Vegas , rented a car , and roadtripped for a week . We hit Death Valley , Bryce Canyon , Zion Canyon , Monument Valley , and the Grand Canyon totally a case of cramming in too much driving and too many sights into a short period of time . If I were to redo this trip today , I 'd probably limit it to just Utah but , you know , hindsights 20/20 . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettttty sure I 'll be back there someday ( in fact , Ive since made another trip to the Grand Canyon ) . <p> Ill DEFINITELY make it back to Zion National Park someday . We only spent a day there due to food poisoning/dehydration ( verdict never came back on that one ) , and did n't  even do the canyon . Instead we hiked to The Subway . <p> As gorgeous as this scene is , I was underwhelmed when we got here . It was n't as I 'd pictured it to be . Little did I know that , had we kept going up this slippery rock and around the corner , I would have reached the bright blue rock pool I 'd seen in countless photos . 205744 @qwx1065744 205742 @qwx1065742 205738 @qwx1065738 205746 @qwx1065746 205740 @qwx1065740 205743 @qwx1065743 205747 @qwx1065747

I pride myself on my stomach of steel , excellent sense of direction and independence , and unfaltering Beast Mode . <p> I had every intention of taking advantage of all the adventure activities Rishikesh , India has on offer .

@@118793429 @7793429/ <p> Cronulla might just be Sydney 's most underrated ocean beach . It does n't have the glitz of Bondi or the dramatic ferry commute of Manly , but let me tell you what it does- have : 6- km of gorgeous , flat , mostly undeveloped sand that you can easily have to yourself if you go far enough out . <p> I very nearly skipped Phillip Island on the roster of Victorian excursions to take from Melbourne . All you ever hear about it is the famous Penguin Parade , and honestly I 'm not super interested in schlepping a couple hours just to watch these creatures waddle onto shore at dusk . <p> Being the non-committal person I am , I 'm not sure yet if I 'll return to Sydney to live later this year . But I do know that whenever my next Sydney stint is , I 'll be spending some quality time in Bondi again . <p> After the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk , the Manly to Spit harbour walk is Sydney 's second most popular walking track .

@@118793438 @7793438/ <h> That Time I Was Cast On Real World : BlogHouse <p> I have no shame in confessing my love for reality tv . I mean , what better mindless entertainment than following along as a bunch of strangers are thrust together to live in a massive house where shenanigans inevitably abound ? <p> It 's one thing to watch it , but it 's an entirely different thing to be a part of it . I 've never had any desire to be on The Real World , but when the opportunity to apply for the next installment of Navigate Media Group 's BlogHouse popped up , I thought hey now THIS is something I can see myself doing . Spending 3 days in a Chicago mansion , living with other up-and-coming travel bloggers while we learn from the best in the travel blogging biz , would be both entertaining and educational . Applying for this was a no-brainer . <p> I half-expected my application to be laughed into the rejection pile , what with my meager following on all social media platforms and general hot mess-ness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel blogging pros of Navigate Media Group believed in this ol ' blog enough to take a chance on me . <p> And so I cashed in some Southwest miles and booked a flight to Chicago to join 13 other newbie bloggers on the 4th season of BlogHouse ! <h> The Blog House <p> I strolled up to the house on Day 1 in typical Lindsay fashion : lugging too many bags , fumbling over the door , standing around like an awkward turtle . But once I stepped inside this Lincoln Park mansion , I felt instantly at ease . The staff at Flipkey 's Villa d'Citta welcomed us with warmth and immediately showed us to our rooms . They had the 3 of us New Yorkers sharing the Milano suite , decorated with a nod to modern Italy . My first thought ? Man , would this be a fantastic spot for one of my wedding photography clients to get ready in . <p> Brimming with excitement , we bounded downstairs to check out the rest of the house like kids on Christmas morning . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of Intelligentsia coffee brewed from beans roasted specially for the villa . And like any good Real World-esque house , ours was stocked with alcohol . We had a continuous supply of Goose Island beer and wait for it a WINE TAP . As in , wine coming through the wall , flowing as easily as water . Could it get any better ? <p> Actually , yes . Add an outdoor patio with a jacuzzi to the mix and you 're practically demanding a party . We effortlessly obliged . <p> Between the gorgeously well-kept house and the tireless efforts of the staff , it 's clear that Villa d'Citta is worthy of its Best B&amp;B in Chicago status . But what really puts them over the top is the food they prepare for guests . I indulged in homemade pizza , fresh pressed paninis , and the best french toast I 've ever had in my life . Our foodie-laden travel blogging group was extremely pleased with the spread . It actually became part of our meal-time routine to wait until everyone had thoroughly photographed the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blog Stuff <p> We may have had a big fancy house and a fantastic city at our disposal , but we came to BlogHouse to LEARN , damn it ! <p> From midday Saturday to Tuesday morning , the expert bloggers had us newbies attending their workshops , panels , networking events , and one-on-one sessions plus a few Chicago excursions thrown in for good measure . Everyone came to BlogHouse with a unique background and skill set , and at varying points in their blogging careers , ready to learn about the world of travel blogging . The energy throughout the weekend was palpable and infectious . <p> We were exposed to an insane amount of information over the course of 3 days , covering topics like business , SEO , WordPress , photography , press trips , working with brands , social media , and more . Quite frankly , I was overwhelmed by Day 2 . Rather than wear myself thin trying to absorb every detail thrown at me , I focused primarily on marketing and monetization : two gaping weaknesses of mine . The resounding message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace it ; after all , without an audience or a following , you ca n't expect your work to gain popularity and earn you travel and money-making opportunities . So I 've resolved to be less of a Facebook hater and to try to connect more with others on Twitter . On that note : help me do good on this by connecting with me on Facebook and Twitter , will ya ? <p> I also quite enjoyed the panel discussions , where a few of the expert bloggers sounded off on their experiences and thoughts on blogging . It was interesting to see how differently they approached some topics , which helped drive home the fact that there is no one way to succeed at travel blogging . There 's no secret sauce or guaranteed recipe that will result in a fulfilling career as a travel blogger . It 's really about trying all sorts of techniques and experimenting until you find what works for you and your brand . <p> One of the best things about BlogHouse in general was how approachable and candid the expert bloggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were happy to answer our questions and even sit with us to go over topics in more depth . In fact , I do n't think Michael had a minute alone the entire weekend because he was so busy helping everyone with their Wordpress setup ! As for me , I got my site audited by Steph , got schooled on all things marketing by Ayngelina , and picked Sherri 's brain on how to make it as a travel photographer . This extra attention from them really helped me process all that I learned in the group sessions and think about how I could apply it to my blog . <p> My big takeaway from this mentoring was : I am a photographer , and I need to make it clear that I am an expert . Did you guys know that I 've been photographing weddings professionally for over 4 years ? Other than a brief mention of my photography business on my about page and perhaps the prettier-than-average photos embedded in every post , I really do n't drive home the fact that I 'm a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing that guides and illustrates my travel experiences . In the future , you can expect a few subtle transitions on Frugal Frolicker : some site layout changes , more photo essays , and perhaps a few how to posts related to taking photos while traveling . <h> The Blog Fun <p> You ca n't keep a bunch of travelers cooped up in a house for too long , so thankfully we had a few excursions planned . <p> On Sunday night , we did some networking and drinking at Vertigo Sky Lounge . Wine and sushi with a view , yes please ! <p> On Monday night , we did a boat trip on the Chicago River with Chicago Electric Boats , followed by dinner at Mercadito ( courtesy of Gogo ) . If only this actually was The Real World we 'd have had highly entertaining footage between us partying on our boat and bemoaning boys after a few cocktails . <p> The general consensus was that this was pretty much the best night ever . Getting to see the city in a golden hour glow , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico , was just an incredible experience . <p> We may not have " had our lives taped " a la The Real World , but rest assured we had just as much footage in the form of instagrams , tweets , and photos as documented by us 20 bloggers ! ( see : #BlogHouse ) <p> And when we were n't learning or excursion-ing , you could find us hanging out in the villa making good use of the wine tap and plentiful Goose Island beer , swapping Tinder stories and swiping for each other . I woke up one morning to a message from some Chicago guy named Jake who I 'd apparently been matched with , saying that no , he did n't have any ab or tiger photos to share with me . Do n't drink and tinder , folks ! <h> The Bloggers <p> Pardon the cheese here , but I have to say it : the best part of BlogHouse is the bloggers . It was so refreshing to be around people who just GET IT . They get that travel is everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and adventurous . They get that it 's more fulfilling to go against the grain and make your own path in life . It 's not always easy to find people at home with the same mindset . <p> I have so much love and admiration for all of the bloggers below . If you 've got a blog reader , be sure to add every single one of their sites to it so you can follow along with their travel adventures ! Some are nomads , some travel while working a ' normal ' job , some are teaching abroad , and others ( most of the experts ) are full time travel bloggers. 205744 @qwx1065744 205741 @qwx1065741 205742 @qwx1065742 <p> After looking at these photos I think I should wear a captains hat 24/7 .
