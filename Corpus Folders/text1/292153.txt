As we 've described previously , our focus is on individual work activities , which we believe to be a more useful way to examine automation potential than looking at entire jobs , since most occupations consist of a number of activities with differing potential to be automated . <p> In all , 1.2 billion full-time equivalents and $14.6 trillion in wages are associated with activities that are automatable with current technology .

Sector differences among economies sometimes lead to striking variations , as is the case with Japan and the United States , two advanced economies . Japan has an overall automation potential of 55% of hours worked , compared with 46% in the United States . Much of the difference is due to Japan 's manufacturing sector , which has a particularly high automation potential , at 71% ( versus 60% in the United States ) . Japanese manufacturing has a slightly larger concentration of work hours in production jobs ( 54% of hours versus the U.S. 's 50% ) and office and administrative support jobs ( 16% versus 9% ) . Both of these job titles comprise activities with a relatively high automation potential . By comparison , the United States has a higher proportion of work hours in management , architecture , and engineering jobs , which have a lower automation potential since they require application of specific expertise such as high-value engineering , which computers and robots currently are not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " China , India , Japan , and the United States " dominate the total , accounting for just over half of the wages and almost two-thirds the number of employees associated with activities that are technically automatable by adapting demonstrated technologies . Together , China and India may account for the largest potential employment impact " more than 700 million workers between them " because of the relative size of their labor forces . Technical automation potential is also large in Europe : According to our analysis , more than 60 million full-time employee equivalents and more than $1.9 trillion in wages are associated with automatable activities in the five largest economies ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) . <p> We also expect to see large differences among countries in the pace and extent of automation adoption . Numerous factors will determine automation adoption , of which technical feasibility is only one . Many of the other factors are economic and social , and include the cost of hardware or software solutions needed to integrate technologies into the workplace , labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some hardware solutions require significant capital expenditures and could be adopted faster in advanced economies than in emerging ones with lower wage levels , where it will be harder to make a business case for adoption because of low wages . But software solutions could be adopted rapidly around the world , particularly those deployed through the cloud , reducing the lag in adoption time . The pace of adoption will also depend on the benefits that countries expect automation to bring for things other than labor substitution , such as the potential to enhance productivity , raise throughput , and improve accuracy and regulatory and social acceptance . <p> Regardless of the timing , automation could be the shot in the arm that the global economy sorely needs in the decades ahead . Declining birthrates and the trend toward aging in countries from China to Germany mean that peak employment will occur in most countries within 50 years . The expected decline in the share of the working-age population will open an economic growth gap that automation could potentially fill . We estimate that automation could increase global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people replaced by automation rejoin the workforce and remain as productive as they were in 2014 . Considering the labor substitution effect alone , we calculate that , by 2065 , the productivity growth that automation could add to the largest economies in the world ( G19 plus Nigeria ) is the equivalent of an additional 1.1 billion to 2.2 billion full-time workers . <p> The productivity growth enabled by automation can ensure continued prosperity in aging nations and could provide an additional boost to fast-growing ones . However , automation on its own will not be sufficient to achieve long-term economic growth aspirations across the world . For that , additional productivity-boosting measures will be needed , including reworking business processes or developing new products , services , and business models . <p> How could automation play out among countries ?

These economies thus have a major interest in pursuing rapid automation development and adoption . <p> Emerging economies with aging populations . This category includes Argentina , Brazil , China , and Russia , which face economic growth gaps as a result of projected declines in the growth of their working population . For these economies , automation can provide the productivity injection needed to maintain current GDP per capita .

@@37681121 @6681121/ <h> When America Was Most Innovative , and Why <p> The competitiveness of the U.S. economy depends on technological progress , but recent data suggests that innovation is getting harder and the pace of growth is slowing down . A major challenge in business and policy spheres is to understand the environments that are most conducive to innovation . One way to do that is to look to history . In our research we focused on the golden age of invention : the late 19th and early 20th centuries , when America became the world 's preeminent industrial nation . <p> The golden age is associated with some of America 's leading technology pioneers , such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in electrical illumination and Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray in telephony . Our analysis goes beyond these well-known individuals . We built a systematic data set that contains millions of patented inventions and millions of individuals in Federal Censuses from 1880 to 1940 . We also linked patent data to state- and country-level information . By analyzing this data , we were able to she 'd light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context for technological development was very different a century ago . For instance , in 1880 most inventive activity was the result of inventors operating outside the boundaries of firms . Research laboratories , such as the famous one opened , in 1876 , by Thomas Edison in Menlo Park , New Jersey , were rare . From the middle of the 20th century , however , the modern corporation started to dominate patenting . By 2000 almost 80% of patents were assigned to inventors associated with firms . <p> Nevertheless , the impact of innovation on economic growth was typically large . The chart below illustrates a strong relationship between patenting activity and GDP per capita at the state level . It predicts that an innovative state like Massachusetts , which from 1900 to 2000 had four times as many patents as a less innovative state , like Wyoming , would become 30% richer in terms of GDP per capita by 2000 . <p> Innovation was more prevalent in some areas than others . The map below shows regions that today are declining , such as the Rust Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our research finds that innovation flourished in densely populated areas where people could interact with one another , where capital markets to finance innovation were strong , and where inventors had access to well-connected markets . States with a legacy of slavery were considerably less innovative , and religion had a negative effect , too , though to a lesser degree . Places that were economically and socially open to disruptive new ideas tended to be more innovative , and they subsequently grew faster . <p> Inventors in the golden age were overwhelmingly white and male . They were less likely to marry and they had fewer children , perhaps because of the time commitments associated with making technological discoveries . Inventors in U.S. history have tended to be highly educated , in contrast to the common portrait of the uneducated amateur . They typically invented in pursuit of profit , and the financial returns to innovation were large . The innovation sector was highly competitive . The best inventors survived . The worst exited quickly . <p> The family backgrounds of inventors were distinctive . Having a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps because fathers passed along their aspirations , or perhaps because it facilitated access to the right types of social networks . Fathers ' incomes were positively correlated with the probability of becoming an inventor . This means that talented individuals from low-income families were more likely to be excluded . ( This remains the case today . ) Much of the link between family income and invention appears to have been due to education . High-income families invested in the education of their children , and , in turn , educated inventors were more productive . <p> Our study also examined the relationship between innovation and income inequality . New innovation is a disruptive force , which may reduce inequality or perpetuate it . <p> We found that the relationship between innovation and inequality depends on the type of inequality we 're talking about . Innovation was negatively correlated to the Gini coefficient , a broad measure of inequality . On the other hand , innovation was higher in places where the share of income held by the top 1% was larger , including in states like New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extensive . <p> Our findings are consistent with two different approaches to thinking about inequality . If innovation is associated with financial rewards from patents and the associated monopoly rights , then we should see a positive association between innovation and inequality . But if innovation permits new entrants or small business owners to catch up with incumbent leaders , then innovation should lead to lower income inequality . <p> Our study is predicated on the idea that what made the United States an innovation powerhouse during the golden age is relevant to the way technological development progresses in the modern era . History matters because innovation and growth are largely about long-run changes . Creating an innovation sector that is both dynamic and inclusive was as challenging a century ago as it is today . <p> Ufuk Akcigit is an assistant professor of economics at The University of Chicago , and a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research . 
@@37681125 @6681125/ <h> Executive Summary <p> The populations of almost all western countries are getting older and are predicted to age even further . As the active labor force declines over time , so does GDP . This poses serious challenges for the health care systems , the pension schemes , or the public debt management of modern societies . Innovation could come to the rescue by boosting the productivity of the remaining labor force . But can we plausibly expect aging societies to be as innovative as they need to be ? We studied a panel of 33 OECD countries over the period 1960-2012 to find out the actual relationship between population aging and inventive activity across countries and time . It turns out to be hump-shaped . What explains such a pattern ? Other studies have shown that individuals tend to decrease in creativity as they age . Our hypothesis is that after a certain point , societies grow aware of the dire consequences of their aging populations and the resulting increase in willingness to innovate , as well as governments efforts to systematize innovation , lead to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries are getting older , as the Baby Boomers , born in the 1950s and 1960s , live longer and have fewer children than previous generations . Population aging of this dimension is possibly unique in world history . No surprise , then , that it poses serious challenges for the health care systems , pension schemes , and public debt management of modern societies . <p> More often than not , politicians see economic growth as a means to alleviate these problems . The arguments are simple : Faster growth means more income to be spent on medical treatments for the old . Higher wages increase the contributions to pay-as-you-go pension schemes , thus preventing pensions from falling . And growth reduces the government 's debt-to-GDP ratio , which facilitates and cheapens future government borrowing . <p> The problem is that population aging is itself a cause for a decline in both GDP and per-capita GDP . Due to a sustained decline in fertility , there are fewer young people entering the labor force than there are old workers leaving it . The active labor force declines over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity increases , a reduced labor force has to nourish more and more retirees and for longer . Accordingly , GDP per capita tends to fall . <p> Innovation could come to the rescue by boosting the productivity of the remaining labor force . If the more productive few can produce as much output as the less productive many , GDP will not fall . Similarly , with fewer but more productive workers in the population , per-capita GDP may stay constant . Innovation is the means ; economic growth is the end . <p> Can we plausibly expect aging societies to be as innovative as they need to be ? Sociologists , policy makers , and cultural researchers tend to stress the hypothesis that old societies lose the spirit of enterprise , favor security over risky dynamism , and become less forward-looking . If this is true , there is little hope . Population aging will lead societies into a state of stagnation with little inventive activity . <p> We studied a panel of 33 OECD countries in the period 1960 " 2012 to find out the actual relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We measured population aging by the old-age dependency ratio " people older than 64 to the working population ages 15 " 64 " and inventive activity by the number of patents per 1,000 residents . <p> The relationship between population aging and inventive activity turned out to be hump-shaped , with a peak occurring at a dependency ratio between 24 and 27 older people per 100 members of the working-age population . This is surprisingly old " such levels were reached in Japan from 1999 " 2003 and in Germany from 2001 " 2004 . Countries located to the left of the hump may age and see their inventive activity increase ; those to the right will inevitably see it fall as they age even further . <p> What explains such a pattern ? <p> Other studies provide some evidence that the decrease in inventive activity after a certain old-age dependency ratio can be explained by individuals ' tendency to grow less creative with age . <p> Our hypothesis is that on the left side of the hump necessity is the mother of invention . To solve their age-induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some level that their standard of living hinges on a rising labor productivity of the working young , and they know that innovations are the main drivers of productivity growth . <p> In another study , we looked at individual attitudes toward innovation in a cross-section of 18 OECD countries for which individual-level data is available . We found that the older people are , the less they appreciate innovation . However , in societies where the whole population is aging , this tendency is weaker . This suggests that the process of population aging may lead to a better understanding and a willingness to adapt one 's attitude toward innovative activity . <p> What can policy makers and entrepreneurs learn from these studies ? An aging society needs a strategy to foster inventive activity to secure its standard of living . <p> Germany and Japan are two aging countries grappling with this problem in systemic ways . Germany 's national innovation strategy , the so-called High-Tech Strategy 2020 , funds research and innovation at the national and state level , supporting investments in growth areas such as green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comprehensive Strategy on Science , Technology , and Innovation in 2013 . The focus of this strategy is the environment , energy , health and medical care , and social challenges . Opening to other Asian economies was also part of the strategy . <p> We recommend that policy makers work to raise awareness about the adverse effects of population aging , communicating to their citizens what aging means for their individual health care , the level of their pensions , and the economic functioning of their government . Awareness acts as a catalyst , changing attitudes and bringing about a societal climate more favorable to investment in innovation . <p> In sum , in countries that understand the consequences of their aging population , entrepreneurs are more likely to find profitable business opportunities .

@@37681126 @6681126/ <h> Why Do Employees Stay ? A Clear Career Path and Good Pay , for Starters <p> Employee turnover is expensive . Replacing an employee who quits costs , on average , 21% of their annual pay . While it 's tempting to dismiss turnover as a fact of life in today 's fast-moving job market , new research shows otherwise . Many reasons employees jump ship are surprisingly simple , and business leaders who do n't ask why workers want to go may be unnecessarily losing people who are pricey to replace . <p> At Glassdoor , we have ample data on workers ' job trajectories from millions of rTsumTs that people have shared on our site . Looking at those rTsumTs , we can gain insight into the reasons for employee turnover by comparing job transitions where workers stayed with their original employer with those where people left for another company . <p> In a new study , Glassdoor data scientist Morgan Smart and I looked at more than 5,000 job transitions from a sample of thousands of rTsumTs shared by job seekers on Glassdoor from 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new role but stayed at the same employer " for example , a junior accountant who switched into a job as accounting manager . Others were employees who moved to a new role and left for a new employer . <p> By combining the data on real-world job transitions with Glassdoor company ratings and salary information , we were able to pinpoint which statistical factors push workers out the door and which motivate employees to stay and grow in their existing organization . Although these patterns are correlational , we believe they reveal important clues to the HR puzzle of how to retain talent . In our study , we looked at how job turnover correlated with pay , company culture , how long an employee has been in their current job , what industry they 're in , and more . <h> Factors That Drive Turnover <p> One of the drivers of turnover is easy to overlook : allowing workers to stagnate in their current role . Even after controlling for pay , industry , job title , and many other factors , we find workers who stay longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to leave for another company for the next step in their career . Stagnating in a role for an additional 10 months raises the odds that employees will leave the company for their next role by about one percentage point , a statistically significant effect . <p> The likely reason is that workers who do n't see a clear progression from their current role to a better position in their company ultimately turn to opportunities elsewhere . And that suggests an easy solution . By providing clear paths for employees , moving them through job titles on a regular progression over time , employers can help boost perceived career opportunities and limit this type of harmful stagnation . <h> Pay Matters <p> However , our research finds that escalating workers through new job titles over time is n't enough ; making sure pay is competitive is also essential to retaining talent . We found that 10% higher base pay is associated with a 1.5-percentage-point increase in the likelihood that workers will stay at their current company the next time they move to a new role , a statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term , employees wo n't stay for new job titles alone . As they assume new responsibilities on their upward paths , compensation should rise along with career arc . If managers do not offer meaningful promotions , in both responsibilities and pay , our data suggests employees are more likely to look elsewhere for their next role . <h> Culture Matters <p> Aside from career progressions and pay , we found that workplace culture matters for employee retention . This will come as little surprise to leaders who are well aware of the research showing the benefits of positive company culture . When employees switch employers , we find they usually move to companies with higher Glassdoor ratings . <p> In particular , we found that raising a company 's overall rating on Glassdoor by one star ( on a one-to-five scale ) was associated with a four-percentage-point higher chance that employees would stay for their next role . Similarly , we found statistically significant links between two detailed measures of workplace culture : higher career opportunities ratings and higher culture and values ratings . In each case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions by one star ( out of five ) was associated with a five-percentage-point higher chance that workers would stay for their next role . It appears that employees who see clear career paths for themselves and who feel committed to a company with a positive value system are statistically less likely to leave for their next role . <h> What Does n't Seem to Matter <p> We found that some workplace factors do n't seem to matter for employee turnover . The first is the quality of a company 's senior leadership . This suggests to us that workers who are deciding whether to remain with an employer do so based on their own prospects for growth in a job , or perhaps based on their relationship with their manager . Even the most inspiring CEOs may not increase worker loyalty if individual employees feel that their careers have stagnated . <p> Second , we find that work-life balance does n't have any statistical link to whether employees stay or leave . Work-life balance certainly contributes to overall employee satisfaction , but does not seem to matter much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave an employer when their prospects for advancement are better elsewhere , and a job with great work-life balance is n't likely to change that decision much . <h> What It Means <p> From the perspective of employees , moving to a new role is something to look forward to . On average , we find workers earn a 5.2% raise in base pay each time they transition to a new role . But more often than not , employees find it necessary to leave for a new employer to achieve that career progression : Among the rTsumTs we examined , 73% of job transitions were workers leaving their employer , while just 27% stayed for their next role . <p> That high rate of employee attrition illustrates the challenges facing HR managers , but also suggests an opportunity . There is room in today 's labor market for greater reliance on internal transitions relative to external career moves . Addressing the drivers of employee turnover can have a profound impact on organizations over time . Even a 1% improvement in the odds that employees will stay for their next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000-person employer . <p> For recruiters , there is another side to the findings of our study . Our results suggest a variety of ways to target talent that may be ready for a move . Candidates who have stagnated in roles for a year or more are statistically more likely to be receptive to recruiter inquiries than candidates who are rapidly climbing their company 's career ladder . And candidates whose current employers have low culture ratings or who are underpriced relative to the market are statistically more likely to consider offers at new employers . <p> Employee turnover is a costly quandary for employers . Our research shows that employers are partly in control of turnover , and that there are clear solutions to reduce it . To better retain employees , set a clear career path for employees , pay them competitively , and cultivate a healthy workplace culture .

This accomplishment is only one example of how analytics could transform health care . <p> Photo by Matthew Payne <p> While debate drags on about legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care system , a new wave of analytics and technology could help dramatically cut costly and unnecessary hospitalizations while improving outcomes for patients . For example , by preventing hospitalizations in cases of just two widespread chronic illnesses " heart disease and diabetes " the United States could save billions of dollars a year . <p> Toward this end , my colleagues and I at Boston University 's Center for Information and Systems Engineering have been striving to bring the power of machine-learning algorithms to this critical problem . In an ongoing effort with Boston-area hospitals , including the Boston Medical Center and the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , we found that we could predict hospitalizations due to these two chronic diseases about a year in advance with an accuracy rate of as much as 82% . This will give care providers the chance to intervene much earlier and head off hospitalizations . Our team is also working with the Department of Surgery at the Boston Medical Center and can predict readmissions within 30 days of general surgery ; the hope is to guide postoperative care in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymized electronic health records ( EHRs ) that contain all of the information the hospital has about each patient , including demographics , diagnoses , admissions , procedures , vital signs taken at doctor visits , medications prescribed , and lab results . We then unleash our algorithms to predict who might have to be hospitalized . This gives the hospital opportunities to intervene , treat the disease more aggressively in an outpatient setting , and avoid a costly hospitalization while improving the patient 's condition . <h> Insight Center <p> The accuracy rates of these predictions surpass what is possible with well-accepted risk scoring systems such as the one that emerged from the famous Framingham Heart Study , the ongoing long-term cardiovascular cohort study that is now in its third generation of participants . Using that system , a doctor assesses the patient 's age , cholesterol , weight , blood pressure , and several other factors to arrive at the individual 's chances of developing cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years . Using the Framingham Study 10-year cardiovascular risk score , one can predict hospitalizations with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 82% rate we achieved . <p> In fact , we found that feeding the factors used in the Framingham 10-year risk score into more sophisticated machine-learning methods still leads to results inferior to ours ( an accuracy rate of about 69% ) . This suggests that using the entirety of a patient 's EHR ( which can contain as much as 200 factors ) instead of just a few key factors leads to superior prediction results . What 's more , an algorithmic approach can easily be scaled so it can be applied to a very large number of patients " something that is impossible with human monitors only . <p> The potential benefits from applying machine-learning analytics in health care are enormous . Based on a study of a year 's worth of hospital admissions , the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) estimated that 4.4 million of those admissions in the United States , totaling $30.8 billion in costs , could have been prevented . Of that $30.8 billion , $9 billion was for patients with heart diseases and $5.8 billion for patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary hospitalizations . <p> Just 5% of Medicaid 's 70 million beneficiaries account for 54% of Medicaid annual expenditures of more than $500 billion , and 1% account for 25% of the total . Of this 1% , 83% have at least three chronic conditions . Approaches like ours could reduce their use of hospital services and save Medicaid a large amount of money . <p> Ongoing U.S. reforms in health care that link payments with outcomes are forcing hospitals to assume more financial risks . In response , hospitals are increasingly making analytics and new technologies an integral part of hospital operations . Business analytics widely used in the transportation industry by airlines and shipping companies are beginning to be employed to schedule operating rooms and staffing . Other algorithms are being developed to assist physicians in making diagnoses . My team has developed methods to automatically titrate medications in intensive care units in response to the patient 's condition . <p> These advances are only the tip of the iceberg . We are on the cusp of major changes in health monitoring and care . Google and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data appear ready to step into this domain . A myriad of technologies , from implantable medical devices ( such as defibrillators and pacemakers ) to fit trackers , smart watches , and smartphones already capture our health data and lifestyle choices . Our credit-card and electronic-payment systems know our purchase history and the type of food we consume . The result is the emergence of a rich personal health record we carry in our pockets . <p> If we can now predict future hospitalizations with more than 80% accuracy using medical records alone , imagine what is possible if we can tap into this trove of personal data . Recommender systems could be used to nudge us to adopt healthier eating habits and behaviors . The holy grail of heading off the emergence of conditions by keeping people well could be realized . <p> Yes , analytics and data-driven personalized medicine and health monitoring present risks . Do we want our employers and health insurers to know the status of our health and the risks we face ? Privacy , security , and reliability of new systems and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new era , we should be working on how to strengthen our methods , institutions , laws , and regulatory framework to avoid those unintended consequences . Algorithms " the foundation of encryption methods , privacy-preserving data processing , and intrusion- and fraud detection systems " could help . <p> Yannis Paschalidis is a professor of engineering and the director of the Center for Information and Systems Engineering at Boston University . 
@@37681165 @6681165/ <h> How Manufacturers Can Get Faster , More Flexible , and Cheaper <p> Meeting customers ' expectations for personalization and customization requires flexibility . And such flexibility can provide a distinct competitive advantage " as long as costs are n't spiraling out of control . In a study of nearly 250 manufacturers over a 10-year period ( 2005 " 2015 ) , we found that 78% of firms had improved their ability to fill their total actual market demand but had lost control over costs . Apparently , chasing the often elusive customer came at a cost that many boards and shareholders had somehow overlooked ( or had discreetly discounted ) . We also found that 11% of the companies studied had suffered both a decrease in their demand fulfillment percentage and an increase in their conversion costs , the labor and overhead costs incurred when converting raw materials into finished goods . Hardly a desirable position . <p> All kinds of companies had failed at operational flexibility . There were companies in a wide range of industries , from automotive and industrial equipment manufacturers to oil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with revenues under $5 billion . There were Japanese manufacturers and Chinese manufacturers . There were companies that had more than doubled production levels during the 10-year period , and even those that had reduced production levels by 10% or more . In other words , we found no flexibility correlation with respect to industry , geography , size , or growth rate . <p> But here 's the interesting part . In our study 11% of the manufacturers were able to both increase their demand fulfillment and lower their costs . What were the secrets of these masters of manufacturing ? We found three common traits . <p> More products but fewer parts . The first is SKU proliferation , or a greater number of product variants , which was a natural response to the need for greater customer personalization . Over 80% of the master manufacturers believe that producing more ( not fewer ) SKUs per line has been a key success factor for them . In fact , more than half of those masters stated that they wanted to further increase their number of SKUs per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs in check , however , the SKU proliferation must involve fewer components . Toyota 's New Global Architecture ( TNGA ) is a case in point . The TNGA approach gives more choice to the customer , but on a simplified platform and with fewer components , all with the aim of cutting conversion costs . <p> Toyota 's goal is to make the transition from having 100 different platform variants to just five standardized platforms across all its models . These five vehicle platforms will cascade into a manageable selection of accompanying components and unique interior choices , helping retain design distinctions . Toyota expects TNGA to help cut factory investments by 40% and manpower by about 20% . In addition , design improvements to the standardized platforms are likely to improve the customers ' driving experience and increase vehicle fuel efficiency . <p> Faster , cheaper , and more flexible through digitization . The second common trait of many masters is digitization . The use of digital designs and 3D printing enables rapid prototyping , which more than 80% of the masters said was imperative for improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . <p> Consider a European automotive company , which has been successfully deploying rapid prototyping across its various businesses , using an effective combination of digitized designs and 3D printing . Such technologies have , for instance , enabled the company to slash the development time for a critical component from 20 weeks to only two weeks , with a cost savings of 92% . And the company is now deploying 3D printing not just for part prototypes but also for actual manufacturing tools . In the company 's truck division , 3D printing has helped reduce the tool manufacturing time from 36 days to two . Moreover , tools printed using a material called thermoplastic have helped slash the tooling costs by 99% . So far , the division has printed more than 30 different production tools , all with 100% accuracy . <p> Optimization through cross-training . The third trait that many masters share is the use of flexible plant designs and multiskilled , or cross-trained , machine operators . A great example of that is Honda 's Assembly Revolution Cell ( ARC ) line , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's new Prachinburi plant , in Thailand . <p> At the facility , each ARC unit consists of one rectangular platform sandwiched lengthwise between two circular platforms . The units are mounted on wheels , and each carries one vehicle body at the center as well as four operators , with a complete set of parts to be installed at the four sides of the vehicle . The entire production line consists of 50 such moving ARC units , one after another , with each capable of assembling a car from start to finish . Adding or removing the ARC units is relatively easy because there are no overhead conveyors and the units are not fixed to the plant floor . This allows flexibility to increase or decrease volume and SKUs at short notice without any major cost penalties . Equally important , the ARC operators learn to solve a broad range of production challenges , another boost to flexibility and efficiency . <p> There are a number of incremental efficiencies built into the design of the line . The curved shape of the circular platforms , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty boxes to be retrieved from the same position in a single trip . Also , operators are not required to walk back and forth between the moving line and the parts shelves , saving precious time . <p> In our study , more than 90% of the manufacturing masters said that cross-trained operators were instrumental to achieving flexibility . What 's more , those companies that failed to achieve master status tended to place less emphasis on employing such workers , with only 79% saying they were an important asset . <p> Reducing changeover times is not the only issue here . Cross-trained operators are better suited to optimize time and effort across multiple tasks while the line is operational . The strategy has helped Honda improve work efficiency by 10% , compared with a conventional line , and because each operator is responsible for a wider range of tasks , their feedback to the design and development teams has turned out to be more insightful . <p> Flexibility is not an end state . It is only relative , tied to how important a company 's need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed effectively , it can earn measurable financial returns even through times of uncertainty and upheaval . As companies continue grappling with the adoption and implementation of digital technologies , they may easily lose sight of flexibility . But the masters of manufacturing recognize flexibility as fundamental to their business . Like efficiency and productivity , it is becoming an increasingly important barometer for future success . 
@@37681191 @6681191/ <p> Most managers would agree that motivated , productive employees are crucial for organizational success , regardless of company size , industry , or corporate strategy . The question is how to motivate them . Offering employees performance-based incentive pay is one common approach , and it usually takes one of two forms : bonuses are offered to individuals based on assessments of their performance , or bonuses are offered as organization-wide incentives , such as profit-related pay or share ownership . <p> Sometimes , these incentives work in ways managers intended them to . But there are ways in which these methods of performance pay can backfire , causing contentious behaviors among employees , complaints about unfair pay distribution , or overwork and stress . Although these critical issues represent real problems for many businesses , little progress has been made in gathering evidence on how different incentive pay schemes " performance-related pay , profit-related pay , and share ownership " might affect employee well-being . <p> We wanted to learn more about this relationship . Our study , published in Human Resource Management Journal , examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' experience of well-being , as measured by job satisfaction , organizational commitment , and trust in management . It also explored the relationship between the schemes and employees ' experiences of high work intensity and how this might explain any undesirable influence of incentive pay on well-being . <p> We used data from face-to-face structured interviews conducted in 1,293 private-sector workplaces across the United Kingdom . The interviewees were senior managers with responsibility for employment relations , personnel management , human resources , or financial management . The main issues covered in the interviews related to workplace characteristics , recruitment and training initiatives , pay determination , payment systems , and workplace performance . We also gathered employee data through questionnaires distributed to a random selection of five to 20 employees in each workplace where the management interviews were conducted . This amounted to 13,657 employees . The survey provided information on working arrangements , working hours , work intensity , and well-being . Data from the management interviews were then matched with employees ' reports about their subjective experiences of work . <p> Our analysis showed that performance-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trust in management . Profit-related pay did not have similar positive effects ; in fact , some levels of profit-related pay resulted in employees being less committed and trusting management less . This contradicts previous studies , in which profit-sharing initiatives have been associated with positive employee outcomes . <p> Our analysis did reveal some important nuances about profit-related pay . Specifically , any positive effects are dependent on the extent to which profit-related pay is available to a large proportion of the workforce . At low to medium levels of employee participation in profit-related pay , we found lower levels of job satisfaction , organizational commitment , and trust in management . However , at high levels of employee participation , we found higher levels of employee well-being . <p> When it comes to share ownership , however , we found a direct negative relationship with job satisfaction and no significant relationships with employees ' commitment and trust in management . High employee uptake of share ownership also revealed no significant relationships with employee well-being . <p> Of the three incentive pay schemes examined , only performance-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intense . In many ways this makes sense : People may feel individual pressure to work harder in order to obtain an individual reward . But , on a concerning note , we found that experiencing this kind of pressure partially , but not completely , offset some of the positive influences performance-related pay can have on job satisfaction , organizational commitment , and trust in management . <p> What should managers keep in mind ? The positive relationship between performance-related pay and all three well-being outcomes indicates that employees may see increases in pay as a reasonable and even positive trade-off for contributing toward organizational success . Contrary to what many employers believe , organization-wide incentives such as profit-related pay and share-ownership may not generate such positive effects , as they were found to have negative relationships with employee well-being . The exception to this argument is the case of high employee participation in profit-related pay , where , if the mechanisms for distributing organizational profits are perceived to be equitable , more employees are likely to benefit and consequently experience job satisfaction , organizational commitment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity and individual-based incentive pay should give managers pause . In some circumstances , performance-related pay may be experienced as a burden that only provides extra pay for workers through an intensification of the work process . This raises critical questions regarding the extent to which individual-based incentives can influence employee well-being in a sustainable way . <p> Chidiebere Ogbonnaya is the Eastern ARC Research Fellow in Quantitative Social Science at University of East Anglia .

Maybe , like Arianna Huffington , it 's a personal crisis that convinces you . Or maybe it 's a key piece of research or two that opens your eyes , as it were , to the dangers of too little sleep : <p> As a choice of cause , you could do a lot worse . Getting sufficient sleep is a need that every human on the planet shares . And for many people , the ability to do that is increasingly under assault , as daily rhythms are disrupted by the changing nature of work and always-on technology . Your arguments for that cause would be helped along by a mountain of evidence about the incidence and costs of sleeplessness , and the efficacy of various interventions . You 'd have the advantage of a solid and accumulating knowledge base regarding what works . Yet you 'd still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your efforts because , for most people , sleep health " their own , their employees ' , their communities ' " has n't yet become a top-of-mind issue . In the three-legged stool of good health , nutrition and exercise are constantly discussed , while sleep has so far come up short . Put all this together , and it 's hard to imagine a cause that would offer you a greater chance to change so many lives for the better . <p> Even better , you 'd have access to a pretty good playbook for how to start a movement . The precedents are out there , and some of the most inspiring of them have been in the realm of public health . We 've seen movements succeed in getting people to quit smoking , getting health workers to wash their hands , and getting people to register as organ donors . Smart people are working to codify the best approaches and tools for raising awareness , changing minds , and inciting action . Even if you do n't have time to master the rules yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key piece of advice in that playbook would be to influence the influencers . Those include , for example , the entertainment industry : What would it take to get scriptwriters and directors to stop portraying people operating on no sleep as models of machismo and dedication ? A second major set of influencers to influence would be the tech community . What new apps , for example , could they create to nudge people toward more healthful behavior ? And then there are the healthcare and education sectors to influence . These are the trusted professionals with whom people already interact about health and informed behavior . What would it take to make sleep a topic of more of those interactions ? <p> But also note that , on top of all those usual influencers , there is another sector that should be recruited into the movement for better sleep health . That would be the corporate sector " and the rationale for targeting it in particular has four parts : <p> Selfish Interest .

They also have the power , through their policies , to change how employees work ( and how managers encourage them to ) . <p> Social Influence . As well as having internal , local influence over their own workers , large employers help to establish broader norms in society . It 's important to get them focused on the importance of sleep health , because the expectations they create about the keys to good work and success spill over to other realms . <p> Sense of Involvement .

That 's why HBR publishes books , interviews , articles , and blog posts on sleep research ( and for that matter , tries to save its own staff from evening and weekend work ) .

@@37681237 @6681237/ <h> Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale on How to Make Money <p> JUSTIN FOX : Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review . I 'm Justin Fox , and I 'm talking today with Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen . Jim and Marc used to work together back in the ' 90s , at this place called Netscape Communications . <p> Jim was the CEO , a former IBM salesman who had held top jobs at FedEx and AT&amp;T Wireless . Marc was a kid , just out of the University of Illinois , who had co-created the first widely-used web browser . They 've both done a lot since then , but at this point I should probably shut up and say hello . Jim and Marc , welcome to IdeaCast . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Hey , it 's great to be here . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : Good to be with you . <p> JUSTIN FOX : I 've brought these two gentlemen together , remotely , to discuss a saying of Jim 's that Marc has been repeating a few times lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Marc , first of all , Jim was kind of famous for his business sayings , right ? <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Oh , of course . I believe we could go for hours . <p> JUSTIN FOX : OK , well , we 'll hit some other ones at the end of this . But this particular one has to do with bundling and unbundling . How do you remember it going , Marc ? <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Jim would say " Jim , correct me if I 'm wrong " in business , there are two ways to make money . You can bundle , or you can unbundle . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : It actually was a quote at the end of a very long roadshow . When we were taking Netscape public , our trip through Europe ended in London . It was our last show , and we were in a big hurry to get the plane . We were at the Savoy Hotel , and the ballroom was full of all these British investment bankers . We gave our normal pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it . <p> We got through and took all their questions , and I said , all right , one last question , ' cause we were in a hurry . And this fella , he says , you know , how do you know if Microsoft is n't just going to bundle a browser into their product , something to that effect . And I said " really just to end the conversation " I said , well , gentlemen , there 's only two ways I know of to make money " bundling , and unbundling . And I said , we 've got an airplane to catch , and we left . <p> And Peter Currie was walking out the door , he said , those people are looking at you , Barksdale , like you 're crazy . He said , what did you just say ? <p> JUSTIN FOX : And what did you tell him ? <p> JIM BARKSDALE : I said , well best I can tell , most people spend half their time adding , and other people spend half their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : It also demonstrates the huge advantage to always be having to leave for a plane . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : That 's right . It also had the added advantage of being true . I do n't remember exactly enough to know if I said , all business . Somebody says that I said , all software . I do n't believe I said , all software . <p> I think I said , business , because I had worked for several businesses during my career , by that time , that had become conglomerates . Some fairly large , and then had divested themselves of various businesses . <p> So certainly , on a large corporate scale , many businesses " add , I 'm on the board of Time Warner , we have just parsed off our third major part , our original company Time , Inc. , which is the publishing arm of Time Warner . <p> We divested ourself of Time Warner Cable , as well as AOL . It 's not uncommon to add a bunch of companies together , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the shareholders think they have more value standing alone than standing together . You do it to get your stock price up . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Now as you said , Jim , bundling and unbundling have been around probably as long as businesses have been around . But especially at kind of the level of how you present a product to the consumer " whether you 're getting a whole bunch of things , like you do with cable TV , or whether you 're buying a song at a time " it just seems like the digital changes we 've been going through over the past 20 years have really made this this key strategic decision for a lot of companies , right ? <p> JIM BARKSDALE : It 's easier to do in the digital age . It 's easier to bundle and unbundle digital products , than it was previously hard products . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Music is obviously " in the internet age , was one of the things that , there was this very clear set of bundles in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big music companies , and for a lot of the artists . And that got completely pulled apart . But now , we 're getting new sorts of bundling in there , right ? <p> JIM BARKSDALE : You mean like with Pandora ? <p> JUSTIN FOX : Yeah . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : I think a lot of it is based on the underlying technology change . And I think this is part of what makes it hard to kind of track how it 's happening , is because the technology keeps changing . The way I think about it is " at least in the world that I work in , sort of tech and internet media " bundles sort of emerge as a consequence of the current technology . <p> So the newspaper bundle " of the idea of this kind of slug of news , and sports scores , and classifieds , and stock quotes that arrive once a day " was a consequence of the printing plant , of the distribution network for newspapers , using trucks , and newsstands , and newspaper vending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place . And when the distribution technology changed , with the internet , there was going to be kind of the great unwind . And then the great , you know , re-bundle " in the form of Google , and Facebook , and Twitter , and all these new bundles . <p> I think your music example is a great example of that . Which is , it made sense in the LP and CD era , to put 8 , or 10 , or 12 , or 15 songs on a disc , and press the disc , and ship it out , and have it sit in stores until somebody came along and bought it . It did n't really make sense to unbundle , given that technology . But when you have the ability , online , to download or stream individual tracks , then all of a sudden , that bundle just does n't make sense . And so it makes sense that it collapsed apart into individual mp3s . <p> And I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-bundling into things like streaming services " like Pandora and Spotify . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Because a lot of the , sort of , early rhetoric around the internet was all about unbundling . You know , we 're going to free all these things from these evil big corporations , and the consumers will be completely in control . I mean , there are elements that are true , but it 's clear that people , at some level , need bundles . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : I think we used the term , disintermediate , a lot more than we did , unbundle from these terrible corporations . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Right . <p> LAUGHTER <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : I do n't remember ever getting the message . <p> LAUGHTER <p> JUSTIN FOX : Bundling is often portrayed as being , somehow , customer unfriendly . I think the current bundle that probably gets the most flak is the cable bundle . But is it really customer unfriendly ? Or is there something actually useful about putting things together , even if the customer does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , being in the cable content business , and network business , I would say it 's probably the number-one debate these days . Not only within the cable companies , but it 's also within the FCC , and the other people who look at it , and customers , and consumers . It has more to do with the total price of the bundle , versus the value of the bundle . <p> And that bundles of any type start coming together " like Marc says " I think , now , because it 's technologically so much easier to do , and the technology allows you to it . Until they either tip over from their own weight , or the consumer says , I would rather have piece parts than the bundle . <p> That was exactly your music analysis . If you remember , the big hue and cry in the ' 90s was , with young people who were buying these expensive CDs , they said , I have to buy the whole CD to get one track . That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this track-by-track download system " I think they were the first , were n't they , Marc ? <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Yeah , that 's right . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : You had this big wave of people that went to it , because it seemed so easy and attractive . The fact that it was free and illegal did n't seem to bother them too much . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : The irony of that " I think we can talk about this now , because enough time has passed where we wo n't make people mad . The irony of that was , it turns out in retrospect , I think there 's a fair amount of evidence that CDs , at that point in the ' 90s , had become an oligopoly cartel . And there were , I believe , several price-fixing scandals , and cases , that have come out of that . <p> And so ironically , the bundlers of that era were operating " probably " illegally , in the way that they were forcing the bundle , and then price-fixing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as big a moral issue on the unbundling and the piracy that resulted is , I think , people felt " from a moral standpoint " like there was sin on both sides . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Right . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : One of the other things you see happening in music now , where actually the music industry 's getting reconfigured , and being split out in new ways . And there are now companies that are entirely online record labels that have started from scratch . Or there are companies that are entirely focused on merchandise sales . There 's companies entirely focused on touring . <p> The old record labels that are still bundled businesses , corresponding to a bundled product offerings , are still struggling to adapt to this new world , with lots of new competitors that are effectively unbundled . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Yeah , they 're unbundled , or they have new sorts of bundles that fit better with the new technology . Like the Spotifys , and Pandoras , and Rhapsodys , and all of them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable industry with these over-the-top systems that do n't spend a lot of time trying to bundle a lot of things . They just bring you a whole single play , like House of Cards , or Alpha Men , or whatever that was . And those are single-shot , unbundled offerings , that seem to do well . And compete with the bundled cable companies , <p> So much so that now , the cable companies are worried about this over-the-top method that goes directly through the internet , and does n't have to carry the overhead burden of bundling everything , trying to get some overhead paid for . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : And from the incumbent standpoint , it all looks very unfair . But from the consumer standpoint , it looks like new options , and new alternatives . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Clay Christensen has described this progression in technology , from the integrated product to the modular . <p> Jim , in your years in the computer industry , you lived that transition . From selling these big things at IBM , to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sounds sort of like unbundling . But we keep getting new bundles nonetheless , right ? <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : And one of the fascinating things , one of the patterns , Justin , I think that you see on that , is sort of this interesting thing . The companies that get taken down by these , kind of , new insurgents " the new insurgents often end up re-forming themselves into a version of the company they took down . <p> Famously , Sun Microsystems took down Deck by unbundling a lot of what it did when it was a huge company . And then Sun sort of re-formed itself into what you might call , a new Deck . A vertically-integrated company , which then got , you know , taken apart , to some extent , by Linux and Intel servers . <p> Or like Oracle , as an example , right ? Larry has spoken openly about his attempt to basically recreate IBM , by adding applications , and services , and hardware , to what had been an infrastructure software business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent through unbundling , then come back and try to do the re-bundle . <p> JIM BARKSDALE : Well , because it 's an effective growth strategy , once you try to grow the business . It 's an easier route to stay focused on your core , and then add things to it , and become a big bundle again . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Which then creates a new vulnerability that you did n't have when you were the insurgent . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Well that 's the wonderful thing about capitalism , that no one is invulnerable . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : Exactly . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Both of you have done a lot of investing , over the years . Marc , you 're one of the founders of the venture capital firm , Andreessen Horowitz . And Jim , you 're involved in a lot of philantrhopic activities . But you 're still doing investing too , right ? <p> JIM BARKSDALE : Oh yeah . I 've invested in a lot , and had a venture firm in the early 2000s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as active as Marc is , though . <p> JUSTIN FOX : In making investment decisions , is this sort of , are you bundling or unbundling theme something that comes up a lot , that you talk about companies with ? Just so they are clear which they 're doing ? <p> JIM BARKSDALE : Most companies , when they 're building strategies , do n't ever use the term bundling . They just think of adding strategic advantages to their products . If they can add it to their core , they add it , to try to be as efficient as they can be . Because there are efficiencies in bundling , and there 's synergies related to bundling . You do n't have to redo a lot of the core services , when you put products together . But I doubt most strategies were ever built using the word , let 's bundle . That 's not a strategic term , really , it 's just an observation . <p> MARC ANDREESSEN : We probably think about the unbundling part a lot more often than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in the new companies , the startups . The way we think about it is " sort of what I said before , about music and newspapers " we see that applied to many other industries , which is often a characteristic of large incumbents . <p> In any industry , often a key characteristic is , they have a bundle , and they have a bundle that has accumulated together over time , for the reasons that Jim described " for reasons that made total sense , at the time . What we look for is for something to have changed in the underlying technology . So the arrival of the internet was a big one , the arrival of mobile , distribution , the arrival of social networks . The arrival of Bitcoin is a current example . <p> So we look for something to change in the underlying technology . And then basically say , well , you know , gee , if you were to sit down today with a clean sheet of paper , and you knew that the technology was changing " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper form of the product , if you were starting from scratch ? <p> And that 's the question that 's always the hardest for an incumbent to ask , because that 's the classic innovator 's dilemma . And that 's the question that 's the easiest for the startup to ask , because the startup literally is , somebody sitting down with clean sheet of paper . All they have is the ability to think , you know , think from first principles , think from scratch . <p> So we look , actively , for the pattern of , large incumbent , established industry , bundled product or service offering , coupled with underlying technology change , coupled with idea for unbundled product that the customer might prefer . And then , of course , coupled with an entrepreneur who can actually build a business around that . <p> I think that 's a fairly common pattern . In fact , if you want to , you can kind of think about the evolution of the internet industry this way . <p> Once upon a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the information services that you use , all in one thing . And then Yahoo came along , and unbundled all the content from the access , because Yahoo did n't have an ISP , and did n't need one . <p> And then , you know , one of the features of Yahoo was search . Google came along and unbundled search . And then , you could even argue , Facebook came along and unbundled search for people . One of the things you could do on Google was search for people . Facebook gave people a much better way to search for other people . <p> And so you can kind of view the technology industry as this sort of family tree , of sort of progressive unbundling . To Jim 's point , a lot of this traces all the way back to IBM . But even , you know , giants of the last 10 or 20 years are in the process of getting unbundled . <p> I would argue , for example , Microsoft has been significantly unbundled , themselves , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what Apple 's done . So the process keeps playing out . <p> JUSTIN FOX : Marc and Jim , thank you again , so much , for talking with us.

But is this anxiety actually based in reality ? <p> Let 's be clear : People are afraid . According to the Job Seeker Nation Report released by Jobvite earlier this year , 55% of job seekers are at least a little worried about job automation . But it turns out that those actually in charge of hiring are n't there yet . Jobvite 's Recruiter Nation Report also says that just 10% of recruiters anticipate automating some jobs in the next 2 " 3 years ( compared to 2015 's 25% ) . <p> We are entering the second wave of the jobs automation process , Automation 2.0 . We 've seen predictable , repeatable , physical tasks ( think forklifts on the factory floor or assembly-line work ) be automated . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of cognitive work ( think diagnosing diseases or reviewing legal documents ) will prove much more difficult , slowing the process until we figure out how to do it . <h> Insight Center <p> We do n't need to fear this new wave , though " because humans occupy a space that machines probably never will . They manage each other , they take responsibility for actions , and they understand the dynamics of working relationships in a way that an algorithm simply ca n't ( at least for the foreseeable future ) . Automation 2.0 will undoubtedly change the labor market , but in a way we can adapt to . <p> The Realities of Automation 2.0 <p> We 're never going to automate every job out of existence . Human beings are relentless in their capacity to invent new ways to serve others , so we will always have new work . A recent McKinsey study shows that there really are tasks that only humans can do for the foreseeable future , particularly in areas such as education and health care . Among them are managing others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market or a knack for creative messaging " and interacting with key stakeholders . There are still aspects of many jobs that can not be automated away , so let 's all take a deep breath for a second . <p> It 's important to recognize that we will inevitably automate parts of almost every job . We 've seen it happen already across manufacturing , food service , and retail operations . As we move into the cognitive work arena , the idea will be the same : We 'll see automation of many predictable , scalable , and repeatable tasks . <p> But while computers can do the rote analysis , even they have limits . Instead of physical work , these tasks will be related to things such as data collection or the processing of algorithms . My own doctor does n't talk to me unless he 's sitting in front of a terminal . Much of what he used to do as a rote part of seeing patients is now automated . In education , many of the daily tasks that have beleaguered teachers can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educations can be delivered online . Does that mean we do n't need doctors or teachers ? No . <p> As this next wave of automation transpires , it will unveil the real value of human beings at work . Humans have an understanding of the dynamic nuances inherent in working relationships and the ability to respond and adapt to those nuances ; machines probably will not get there . This is where strong managers and mentors excel . Humans can provide judgment and hold each other accountable for their actions . This is why a single fatal accident with a self-driving car reminds us that machines , for all their excellent attributes , can not be blamed or accept responsibility . <p> While fears about Automation 2.0 are n't as founded as we thought , the movement will impact the labor market significantly . As technology enables experts to offload rote tasks and analysis , they gain time to tend to the other work that can not be automated " the work that makes them uniquely necessary . In that sense , people performing expert cognitive labor will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're seeing doctors who can effectively oversee the treatment of hundreds of patients because they have computers . We 're seeing lawyers who can effectively handle hundreds of clients because they have technology to assist in research and analysis . <p> But as people in these professions leverage technology to apply their expertise , we likely wo n't need as many of them . And those who succeed will have to be people who are extremely well prepared to function in a technological and automated work environment . In fact , they might not even need to go as far in their expert education to perform these jobs . With the right technology skills , and with automation in play , we 're learning that physician assistants and paralegals can do the same work with less investment . <p> These changes are n't negative , but people concerned about how the automation of cognitive work might impact their careers ca n't stick their heads in the sand . If we can continue to innovate and accept technology in the labor market and better incorporate technological skills into our education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lucrative opportunities that only humans can effectively seize . 
@@37681240 @6681240/ <h> Solving the Twin Crises of Energy and Water Scarcity <p> Few people realize the important role water plays in our daily energy use , or the energy required to heat , treat , and supply water . Powering one 60-watt bulb for 12 hours a day over the course of a year can require 3,000 to 6,000 gallons of water " enough to fill a large tanker truck . Meanwhile , the electricity used for water treatment can be as much as one-third of a city 's energy bill . <p> Most companies ' value chains are heavily dependent on water and energy resources . Automobile manufacturers , for example , create products that rely on metals , chemicals , oil , and gas , which are among the most energy- and water-intensive industries . Others , including technology and telecommunications companies , are major customers of " and suppliers to " those industries . Almost everyone has some skin in this game . <p> Looking ahead , the global population growing from 7 billion to 9 billion over the next 25 years will make the challenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Currently , more than 650 million people lack access to clean water , and a billion do not have electricity . <p> In a joint GE/WRI report , we highlight several countries and industries that are among the first to face the challenges of finding reliable supplies of water for energy production or supplies of energy for meeting water treatment needs . They include electric power producers in China and shale gas developers in the United States , who are looking at alternative options ( such as waterless technologies , water reuse , and brackish water ) that will allow them to be less dependent on increasingly stressed freshwater sources . The report also highlights efforts in the Middle East and North Africa to increase efficiencies and tap renewable energy sources in desalination plants . <p> Risks and solutions emerging in these regions suggest that we should be thinking creatively and collaboratively to meet future needs . Industries will have to overcome daunting commercial barriers . Water and energy are not typically priced to reflect their true scarcity , value , or costs . Coordination and investment across energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be needed . The report offers three ideas for catalyzing such partnerships to meet the water-energy challenge . <p> Focus first on cost-effective solutions that reduce or shift demand . Investing in a supply-side solution such as seawater desalination can be as much as four times as costly as water reuse or other resource productivity options . Rather than trying to increase the supply of limited freshwater or fossil fuel resources , energy and water utilities can work with energy- and water-intensive industries to test and prove partnerships that boost efficiency and scale alternatives . Collaborations among energy producers and users , for example , can help scale technologies such as solar PV and wind power that require only negligible amounts of water . When a large group of commercial energy users gets together and outlines the types of renewable energy products they want to buy , their energy suppliers will listen . Similarly , companies and cities can make better use of otherwise wasted water and energy . The energy content of municipal sewage can be two to four times greater than the energy required to treat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turning that waste into electricity " enough to power entire treatment plants . Similar wastewater projects in Chinese cities are showing that sludge can be converted into valuable products such as vehicle fuels and organic composts . <p> See water and energy through women 's eyes . Involving and empowering women will be essential to meeting the water and energy needs of 9 billion people . In developing countries , women spend 25% of their day collecting water and 40 hours per month collecting fuel for their families . They are in charge of water and energy decisions at the household level , and their views must be included at the resource planning level as well . Companies such as Unilever and Coca-Cola are already involved in gender-empowerment initiatives that support economic development and stewardship of local water supplies . Partnerships can help finance women entrepreneurs , create local centers to supply clean water , and inform communities via text messages when clean water is available .

Managing water and energy risks will benefit from a full view of their costs and value to the business . Factoring the cost of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into future investments is an increasingly common business practice . More than 1,000 companies report that they are pricing carbon internally or they plan to within the next few years . Some , including several major oil and gas companies , are coming together at an industry level to work with governments on carbon pricing approaches . However , oil and gas companies are among those lagging on transparency when it comes to water risk . Assessing water risk and valuing water can be more complex but just as important as anticipating future energy and carbon costs .

@@37681251 @6681251/ <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review . I 'm Amy Bernstein , and I 'm here today with Clayton Christensen , professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School , and co-author of Consultants on the Cusp of Disruption , a feature in the October issue of HBR . Joining us on the phone is Dominic Barton , Global Managing Director of McKinsey and Company . Dom , Clay , thanks for being here today . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Delighted to be with you <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Great to be here . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Clay , you 've documented the phenomenon of disruption for years across numerous industries , probably most famously in the steel business . What are you seeing in the world of general management consulting ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Well , I will say that I see disruption occurring there , but everybody needs to know that we 're not pointing the finger at everyone else , that the process of disruption is occurring against the Harvard Business School itself . So this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do see it happen , and disruption always occurs in ways that it emerges in parts of the market where you would n't even think to ask . <p> And in this case , what disrupts any business is somebody takes a piece of business that is not attractive to the leaders , and because it 's not attractive in the pursuit of profit , they go to bigger and bigger , and nicer and nicer pieces of business . And then the disruptor starts at the bottom and moves up . And what 's attractive in the consulting business is big clients who have big problems . And the more they can have more of those kinds of clients , the more profitable they become . <p> And what they leave behind are small pieces of business " small companies ; tangible , immediate projects that they do and then you leave . And those are the kinds of disruptive innovators in consulting that are taking root . And then they move up , going after bigger and bigger pieces of business . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing , and what you see in other industries ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Yeah . Really , disruption is a process . The theory itself is in evolution over time . So at the beginning , we thought that the vertical axis in the disruptive diagram was the quality of the product . <p> And then we realized that , no , that 's just what customers are more profitable versus less profitable . And when we understood that , just everything fell into place . So for example , if you think of the airline industry as being disrupted , what 's the vertical axis on that diagram ? I mean , once you have economy and first class , how do you go up market from first class ? It just does n't make sense . <p> But then we realized , oh my gosh , it 's the length of the route . Long routes are more profitable than short roots . And so the big majors are getting out of short routes , and turning that over to regional jet providers so that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . And once you understood that , it 's happening . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : So that 's your point about bigger problems , bigger clients ? That 's the top of the y-axis ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : That 's exactly right . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Dom , when did you know the world of consulting was changing , and that McKinsey had to change , as well ? <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Well , first of all , I think I 'd say that the consulting has been changing . For the last , I think , 20 or so years , there have been changes . And I think what was , if you will , an inflection point was " for me , at least " was in 2009 , when I took on this role , I had some work done , which we recommend . We typically have our clients do when a new CEO comes in " which was just , how 's the global context shifting ? And it was a work called global forces , which are , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 years as far as we can see out , recognizing that could be a difficult thing to do ? <p> And to cut a long story short , that work kind of said to me that we are in a time for some significant change in the world , and why should we think that we 're immune to that ? I try to see " Amy , as you know " two CEOs a day , and one of the things that always came through was technology 's moving five times faster than management . I do n't know whether to be paranoid or excited . I 'm typically both , with sort of a comment " this shift towards Asia and Africa , resource scarcity . Just a lot of big issues , and it just made me think , well , maybe we better think about what is that we 're doing . <p> And so as a result of that , we 've launched a kind of an internal strategy review , which basically was an 18 month process , again , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time talking with our clients , and also with people we do n't work with " clients we would like to serve , but companies that we 've never served , talking to people outside the industry , observers and so forth . And it suggested that , as Clay has written in the article , that change is afoot in many dimensions . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Can you talk a little bit about what you were hearing specifically from CEOs that made you think you needed to go back and challenge the orthodoxies of McKenzie ? <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Yes , there were a number of things . I think one was , why does every issue or opportunity or problem take a project manager plus two associates three months to solve it ? Surely , there are other ways , more efficient ways . Surely , sometimes we may just want data . If you guys had collected information on how hospitals work , and you had a large number of them , and looked at how often an operating table was used and so forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the data , not the people , if you will . <p> So there was a notion of be more flexible . What we really value is x versus y . Sometimes , you go into far too much analytical detail . We only need to go 60% of the way to be able to get it . <p> We value the judgment , not so much the analytics . And this obviously varied by situation and type of client . But there were a lot of questions on " or suggestions on " you could be a lot more flexible in terms of how you work with us " the type of people , the amount of time , and so forth . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Anything about this strike you , Clay ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Actually , no . McKinsey is doing all of the right things . And yet , by doing the right things , it sets in place the process of disruption , which you then have to account for . And so the descriptions of the work that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we would call sustaining innovations . It 's hard to do , and that 's why they do it so well . <p> And then , when they take low-value adding activity , and outsource that to somebody , if you listen to the people in that company about what do they do next and next and next , they will try to do more and more high-value adding work relative to where they started out . And so the process is " he 's described it exactly right . And dealing with that is the big innovator 's dilemma . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : So Dom , talk a little bit about McKinsey Solutions , if you would , if you could describe it . And tell us about the internal re-think that led to it . <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Sure . Well , as I mentioned , we did this " we called it a firm strategy review , which is n't a very exciting name , but that was the 2010 effort we launched where , again , we talked to a whole range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also alumni ; and in that , a number of ideas for how we could work differently with clients , and what we work on or put forward . And one of them was actually an idea that had already been lurking in the background . It had come in in 2007 , which was around taking data , if you will . And we sort of stumbled into it , and I 'll give an example . <p> One was around Chinese consumer insights . We found " when I was living in China , we could n't rely on a lot of the publicly available data , and what consumers were doing . So it just was n't reliable or it was n't accurate , so we started to develop our own . And we built a very large database of the Chinese consumer " the middle class consumer who 's changing at a very rapid rate , far more rapidly than we 've ever seen before . <p> And I wo n't bore you with all the detail of it , but we built that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something that actually clients wanted , and they wanted that " was the prime thing they wanted , as opposed to the McKinsey people around it , if you know what I mean . They said , we would actually like that data , and you 've been collecting it , and we 'll pay for that . We do n't really need a team . <p> And so , that was one of the early McKinsey Solutions . There were some things in health care and a number of other areas . And we were experimenting with this , but the firm strategy review really kind of popped that out . And people said , boy , if you had that type of thing , we 'd be very interested in that sort of information , and a new way of working with people , and so forth . <p> So that was the genesis of it . There had kind of been glimpses of it , or it was lurking in the organization . We were n't really aware of what we had . It was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I did on that one was put one of the most experienced senior people in the firm " actually , Michael Patsalos-Fox , who is a very close friend , and has been in the firm for 30 years . He used to run our Americas group . I had him lead our McKinsey Solutions . <p> And it was a bit of New Ventures Group , but McKinsey Solutions was a big part of it , because I knew he would stimulate it and he 'd protect it , because one of the things " I 'd be interested in Clay 's view " but when you try new things , it 's amazing the number of people and antibodies that are in the organization that try and kill it , because it 's different , and it 's why are we doing this ? And we 're cannibalizing something , this is n't right " all that sort of stuff . <p> So we needed a very strong leader to protect it , if you will , and nourish it . And he did . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were three of them , to I think we now have 18 . And it really was to help develop the model . <p> By the way , some of them have not worked . We 've had to shut them down . But fortunately , the vast number of them are working , but it meant we had to change our people processes , right ? A person who is running a McKinsey solution , which is more like a piece of software . So that 's sort of a bit of an overview . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : It 's really interesting . And Clay 's been taking notes . I wonder what you think of what Dom 's been describing . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : So you 're doing everything right that I can imagine you would do . And as a result of that , I worry about you . My wife said that she describes me as the Jewish mother of business , in that it does n't matter everything that is going right , a Jewish mother always worries about what 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred in the traditional department store business . In the early ' 60s , there were over 300 department stores . There are now only eight remaining . Macy 's is the largest . <p> And they were disrupted by discount retailers like Walmart and Target and Kmart . And the way the traditional department stores made their money is they generated gross margins of 40% . They turned their inventory over three times a year . So they got 40% times 3 equals 120% return on capital invested in inventory every year . And that 's the way they measured things . <p> When the disruptive retailers came in , they generated gross margins of 20% , and they turned their inventory over 6 times a year . So 20% times 6 equals 120% return on capital invested in inventory . And so their profitability " the bottom line was the same , but the method by which they generated that result was different . And that was the killer . <p> And so , the challenge " which will be a perpetual challenge " is that imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line is the same . The formula by which they generate the profitability will be different . <p> And so every day , somebody 's going to come in to senior management saying , that does n't make sense , because from their perspective , it does n't make sense . And I wish I could say from my studies that that will go away , but it 's just smart people in the core business trying to improve their profitability when they see resources being spent on something that , from their perspective , does n't make sense in their belief that they 're helping McKinsey ? treasury ? to stop doing what disruption says you should do . And so it 's a long way of saying congratulations , and oh my gosh , be careful . <p> DOMINIC BARTON : I think that 's very good caution . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : So Dom , how do you deal with those antibodies , the ones that you referred to , that Clay just described ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : And they 're not bad antibodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it they exist in the pursuit of profitability , but they 're antibodies nonetheless . <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Yeah . And also , I think it 's the " we do n't measure profitability like a department store in that sense where I know where it is . But it 's also tradition , right ? It 's kind of we 're here to work in a particular way . We 're not a software house . I mean what is this ? There 's that element that comes in , too . <p> One of the things I found , by the way , is history is just a good thing to look at in your own institution as to what 's worked and what has n't worked . And so one , believe it or not " this sounds very trite " was when we decided to move to Europe from the US in 1959 . There was a huge debate about it . I think the partnership with split as to whether this was a good idea or not to do it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Global Institute , right ? This was a research body that was actually set up purposely to do nothing to do with client work , if you will . It was a micro view of macro issues so as to help advance the state of management . But it explicitly could have not a direct link to clients . <p> And I thank God every day that we 've got that Institute up and running , but I know that there were so many people that tried to kill that thing for probably 8 , 9 years in McKinsey . We 're not a think tank . Why are we wasting this money ? How much are we paying these people ? Blah , blah , blah . <p> So in a minor way , I 'm fearful of the antibodies , because I 've seen them , and I know that just from some of the things we did do , it took extraordinary leadership of some of the people in those places to kind of " they 've probably got a lot of scars on their back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a bit to the organization is important , to say , you know , we actually have done some things differently . <p> One other story . I remember when we set up our operations practice . And I sometimes tease people about this in McKinsey . It was in , like , 1990 , I think , is when that started . And this is how to do lean , and how to take costs out of procurement and so forth . <p> And there was quite a raging debate in McKinsey about going into this . And this is n't , again , so much an innovation in how we work , but certainly was n't what we work , because we were seen as a strategy firm . And there were literally comments from some senior people in McKinsey , saying , we do n't want to do that type of work . That 's the work that knuckle-draggers do . I mean , really sort of rude statements were made to this group of partners that wanted to build this practice . <p> And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why that practice was able to grow and be successful , even though they did things in quite different ways . We hired quite different people because of how they worked with the organization , what they stood for , how committed they were , all this sort of stuff . So those are things that are going on . <p> But I 'm trying desperately to look as much as we can for wherever we 've had some innovation , to try and drive it , and then kind of relate that to people and say , you know what , guys , I know this may seem strange to you in where it is , but we have done this . My only worry is I think that the speed and pace of change that we 're going to have to go through is going to go faster , and be bigger given these global forces . And that 's where I think Clay 's Jewish mother analogy is a good one . A bit paranoid about that . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Good for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop jumping up and down here . <p> DOMINIC BARTON : One other thing , Amy . I was going to ask Clay this . To what extent do you think it 's normal " I 'm struck by that some of the changes that you need to go through are actually lying around in the organization , but we do n't recognize them . So sometimes I wonder , maybe we do n't know what we have , if you know what I mean , that could help us . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : It 's a great observation . And what you can predict is that all of these things are bubbling up , and the organization itself will only identify those things that help the organization make more money in the way it 's structured to make money . And if there 's an idea that is proven at a small level , if it does n't fit the way the organization makes its money , it will either languish , or the organization will force it to conform itself to the way it makes money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it in that it wo n't come up to the top as an interesting idea if the organization ca n't use it . And then b , even if they see it , they will make it conform itself to the way they make money . And to have something that truly is disruptive " and in this case , that deep understanding of how an area or an industry works " and use that in the context of McKinsey Solutions , which would be a disruption in disruption , is really hard to do . And if you could pull it off , my gosh , congratulations It just is really hard . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : So this last question is to both of you . Where is the consulting industry going ? What 's it going to look like in the next 10 to 20 years ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : So I would bet that the existing leaders are going to be very vibrant 20 from now . And what they 're going to be increasingly known for and good at are the complicated problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are projects that they can bill at higher prices for the world 's largest corporations . <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : So scale is an important factor in this complexity ? <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : That 's right . That 's right . But on the other hand , there will be new companies that begin to be more and more important . And things that today seem out of the ordinary , unique , judgment-filled , a generation from now these will be standardized and outsource-able . <p> And it 's those that hit the outsourcing balls from McKinsey . They then start doing the low-value adding stuff . And then always the next question is " next year , how can we provide more and more value adding ? And so , my bet is that 20 years from now , there will be people who today are n't significant now start to become more and more significant . <p> And I think we can predict that . And it 's not because I would n't ever attribute anything to McKinsey doing anything wrong . It 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : So from where you sit , Dom , does that seem to be where the industry is going ? <p> DOMINIC BARTON : Yeah , I think I would agree with Clay in the sense that I think there will be some new players . I 'm biased . I 'm determined that we 're going to be around and be leaders come hell or high water . But I think the way what we do and how we work will , I think , have changed pretty significantly . <p> And what I mean by that is if I " again , I go back to the kind of 70% of our work was in strategy , organization . Corporate finance is now 30% . I think we 're going to see at minimum that kind of a shift in terms of what we 're working on , but more importantly " as Clay said " is how we 're working on it . <p> And I think there will be any elements that can be disaggregated or outsourced will be out . And just to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first projects I did in McKinsey . This was in 1986 , was a consumer goods project we were trying to figure out . <p> It was for a fast food company , and what the size of a particular meal should be " how many pieces of chicken should be in the order , and so forth . And I think it took six months to come up with a recommendation . I think with today 's technology " the search technology , the amount of data that 's available " I 'd be surprised if that project would n't take two weeks , if you will . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Absolutely . <p> DOMINIC BARTON : And the last thing that sort of goes through my mind is the work that Foster did on looking at the average lifetime of an S&amp;P 500 company . And that one , if I had anything that 's over my office wall , that 's one " you know the average . I think the average lifetime was something like 90 years in the mid 1930s , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so I just think we have to have an assumption , a bit of a paranoid view of where we have no God given right to be here , so we better be spending some certain amount of resources or experiments going on . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : Amy , can I just add one other thing ? <p> AMY BERNSTEIN : Of course . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : I think in many ways , the business of the Harvard Business School is to develop useful theories about management that can be used . And in many ways , McKinsey and its competitors in the consulting business are a distribution channel for our ideas . And if they are n't vibrant , then we do n't have a way of getting our ideas to individual " individual people can read the Harvard Business Review . But for an idea to impact a company , we do n't have in academia a channel for that idea . It has to be people like McKinsey , who " I 'm sure that you wo n't be happy with my referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No . <p> CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN : You take an idea , you value add it , and you send it . And it 's just very important to us that we have a great relationship with you . And if I were going to be a Jewish mother for the Harvard Business School , I would say , ladies and gentleman , have you noticed that McKinsey is pulling in-house the development of the next generation business ideas ? <p> And when you see that happening , as the provider of the ideas , we got to say , we need to just look at the mirror in a very , very thoughtful way .

A new employees manager is one of the most important people in the onboarding experience , and winning this persons enthusiasm may directly support or undermine a new hires success : 17% of new hires leave within the first six months . New research finds that managers support new employees more when they the managers perceive that the employees are more committed . Managers should remember , though , that first impressions can be misleading , and energetically support the onboarding of all their new employees . <p> Nicholas Blechman for HBR <p> It used to be that onboarding was a process of just a few days , but new research shows that spending as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace is necessary to capitalize on the skills , knowledge , and excitement they bring to the organization . What 's more , companies with successful onboarding programs are not just more likely to retain their new hires but even report measurable profit growth . <p> The first three to six months " when new hires are particularly susceptible to turnover " are most critical . On average , companies lose 17% of their new hires during the first three months , one study found . <p> Effective onboarding programs have the dual purpose of supporting both new employees and hiring managers through socialization and professional support . For example , Google now uses an electronic checklist to remind managers to discuss roles and responsibilities with new hires , set up check-in meetings for the first six months , and match new hires with a peer buddy . Zappos offers new hires a five-week course that teaches them about the culture and values of Zappos .

Integrating into the social network matters , in part , because it brings greater access to information and resources . Another recent study we conducted found that among software engineers in India , new employees sought out more information when they felt connected to others in the organization . <p> A new employee 's manager is one of the most important people in the onboarding experience , and gaining this person 's support may directly improve or undermine a new hire 's chances of succeeding . In a study that followed 409 college graduates through their first two years on the job , the degree of supervisor support that new employees felt during that time period had implications for role clarity , job satisfaction , and even their salary over time . In another study we found that supervisors can promote or inhibit newcomer adjustment through their supportive or obstructive behaviors . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take into account not just the experience of the newcomer but also that of hiring managers . <p> We know that managers are busy and rarely have time built into their formal roles for the onboarding of new employees . So what motivates managers to support new employees in their onboarding ? <p> To answer this question , we conducted another field study of new software engineers in India , in which we surveyed new employees and their direct managers at different points in their onboarding experience . We focused our attention on why some employees received support from their managers while others did not . We found that because managers have limited time , they look for signals that new employees are committed to their own onboarding . In other words , new employees who are proactive about their own onboarding will likely receive attention and support from managers .

It is important to encourage managers to check in with new employees and make time to offer support . At the same time , new employees should be encouraged to do their part to engage in and take control of their own socialization and onboarding by asking questions , seeking out information , and taking advantage of opportunities to meet fellow coworkers . <p> Allison M.

Creativity and innovation are not among them . We know how some factors affect creativity and innovation , but we 're only just beginning to understand some of the more complex relationships . <h> You and Your Team <p> Creativity researchers usually make a distinction between creativity and innovation . Innovation involves two stages " the generation of new ideas and the implementation of the ideas . Creativity is considered to be the first stage of innovation . While we know a lot about both , there 's still not a lot of research to guide leaders . <p> A compelling vision . Teams are more innovative when members have a common understanding of team objectives and are also committed to them . Clear and valued objectives can create meaning and motivation for team members . <p> Goal interdependence . Goal interdependence is the extent to which team members can meet their goals only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Olympic gymnastics team has low goal interdependence ; team members can win individual medals even if the team wins no medal . An Olympic hockey team has high interdependence ; the goal is achieved only by the full team , not by individual members . Goal interdependence leads team members to act toward each other in a way that creates mutual benefit . You create goal interdependence by setting objectives that must be achieved collectively and by addressing issues , including feedback , as a team . <p> Support for innovation . Teams are more innovative when managers expect and approve of innovation , support members when their attempts to innovate are not successful , and recognize and reward new ideas and their implementation . This means encouraging risk and expecting failures . <p> A task orientation . This is a shared concern for excellence that stems from the compelling vision . Teams with a task orientation set high performance standards , monitor their performance and provide each other feedback . <p> A cohesive team . Cohesion represents commitment to the team and a desire to be part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe environment that enables members to challenge each other and the status quo . <p> Strong internal and external communication . Strong internal communication ( between team members ) allows for sharing knowledge and ideas , and creates a safe environment for providing feedback . External communication ( communication with those outside the team ) fosters innovation by learning from others and bringing new information into the team . <p> While these ideas may not be entirely surprising , do n't be misled by their familiarity ; creating these conditions is still challenging work . Some of the factors we 're just starting to learn about that affect innovation are not obvious , and can even be counterintuitive . Here are three : <p> What facilitates creativity can hinder innovation " and vice versa . Creativity and the second stage of innovation require different individual skills and team structures and processes . The idea generation stage is often referred to as divergent thinking or exploration . The implementation stage is often referred to as convergent thinking or exploitation .

Although it may seem intuitive that increasing team diversity increases creativity and innovation , the research shows mixed results . A recent meta-analysis to tease out the results found that cultural diversity increases creativity , but it also increases task conflict " that is , conflicts regarding the distribution of resources , procedures and policies , and interpretation of facts " and also reduces group cohesion . However , cultural diversity did not have any effect on team performance . Other research found that increasing the number of functional areas represented on a team created no significant difference in innovation . Still other research found that to gain a benefit from diversity within teams , team members need to take the perspective of those who differ from them . Just as the benefits of cultural diversity are not inevitable , neither are the costs . But avoiding these costs requires a commitment to understanding and intervening in the dynamics of diversity . <p> You need the right level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a key factor in creativity and innovation but , here too , the research has found mixed results . Attempting to tease out this puzzle , one study of project teams found a curvilinear relationship , with creativity highest at moderate levels of task conflict . But this relationship occurred only at the early phase of a team 's life cycle ; at later phases , task conflict was unrelated to team creativity . Here , the challenge for you and your team is to create a productive level of conflict . <p> The routes to team innovation are still being developed . There 's a lot that we know , and much more that researchers are striving to understand . To help maximize creativity on your own team , understand that the road to innovation is n't always as straightforward as we may have once thought . 
@@37681300 @6681300/ <h> Managers Need to Up Their Game with Social Media <p> Using social media to accomplish a meaningful purpose involves more than providing new technology and praying for success . Successful mass collaboration places new requirements on an organization , particularly its managers . While many organizations are technically ready for social media , they should question the readiness of managers to embrace new ways of working collaboratively to achieve social success . <p> Why ? Because social media and mass collaboration fundamentally challenge the relationship between responsibility , resources , and management . Normally , managers accept responsibility provided it comes with control of the resources required to deliver on that responsibility . The connection between responsibility and resources sits at the heart of management authority , control , accountability , and organizational design . Look at an organization chart and you will see the distribution of resources and responsibilities " the currency by which managers measure themselves and compare themselves to their peers . <p> Unfortunately , this control is the antithesis of collaboration . Relinquishing control to create space for collaboration challenges managers who rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . And managers who exercise their authority over a collaborative community will defeat the purpose of social media-based collaboration and turn energetic and innovative communities into just another form of corporate task force . <p> While it sounds obvious that managers can compromise collaboration with prescriptive control , the relationship between resources , responsibility , and management is one of the most frequently asked questions in organizations looking to apply social media to achieving meaningful business purposes . Collective responsibility is a thorny issue and it takes a different level of management maturity to break the idea that if there is n't one person responsible , then no one is responsible . <p> Manager as Guide Effective managers in social organizations embrace a different style of management and leadership . In our research for the book , The Social Organization , we found a style of management based on the manager/sponsor as guide rather than leader . In this role , the manager/sponsor works across three levels to drive three important outcomes : <p> Participation . Increased participation can be created when managers/sponsors work within a community to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions , plans etc . Participation is critical to community engagement and creativity , especially when pursuing a meaningful purpose means fostering and allowing a difference of opinion . <p> Purpose . Purpose requires the manager/sponsor to step outside the community and assess its progress toward achieving its overall goals and objectives . Purpose reflects the foundational idea behind the community . Managers/sponsors act as guides by knowing when to ask how a particular thread contributes to the community purpose . <p> Performance . Performance of the community requires that the manager/sponsor bridge collaborative innovation or ideas and the organization 's formal management structures and processes . Without a focus on performance , community-based ideas often stay within the community . In this regard , managers/sponsors are advocates for community ideas and insights across the enterprise . <p> Participation , purpose , and performance represent the goals for guiding management and the requirements for effective managers/sponsors in mass collaboration . However , it takes a particular type of manager and management team to foster the type of mass collaboration that taps into the collective genius of your customers and employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to lead mass collaboration ? Ask yourself or your managers the following questions to determine if you and they are ready for social media : <p> Do managers rely on their formal authority to deliver results and fulfill their obligations , or do they achieve results through influence , teamwork , and engaging the talents of their team ? <p> Do managers have to be the most senior , experienced , or knowledgeable person on their team ? Have they achieved the position based on being the best in their discipline ? Is their influence based on personal capability or interpersonal leadership ? <p> How does executive leadership respond to ideas , insights , or innovations that emerge from the organization rather than going through formal channels ? Does the executive team believe that the future of the organization is his or her responsibility alone or is it a shared responsibility of everyone in the organization ? <p> The criteria embodied in the questions above and discussed in greater length in The Social Organization appear steep , but they are not insurmountable if you match social-media purpose to management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting small and scaling based on the expanding capability of collaborative communities and growing management capacity provides a path for every organization to become a social organization .

What links the world together has changed fundamentally " and for many companies , succeeding in this new operating environment will require rethinking many past decisions and assumptions . <p> The 20th-century version of globalization was defined by rapidly growing trade in goods , as major multinationals created supply chains that spanned the world . Today growth in global trade has flattened , and it looks unlikely to regain its previous peak relative to world GDP anytime soon . The same is true for cross-border financial flows . <p> But globalization has n't gone into reverse . It 's gone digital . Cross-border data flows have grown by a factor of 45 over the past decade , and they 're projected to post another ninefold increase by 2020 . <p> Recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute explores this new era of digital globalization . We find that over the last decade , global flows of goods , services , finance , people , and data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7.8 trillion in 2014 alone . Perhaps most striking is the fact that data flows already accounted for $2.8 trillion of this value " exerting a larger economic impact than the global trade in physical goods . This is a watershed moment , given that the world 's trade networks formed over the course of centuries , while cross-border digital flows barely registered just 15 years ago . <p> What exactly makes up these cross-border digital flows ? Corporations generate a large share of internet traffic through private networks used to share information and manage their international operations . And consumers generate a significant portion as they communicate , search , shop , watch videos , and post their own content on social networks , online marketplaces , and digital media platforms . The biggest of these platforms can support hundreds of millions of users ; in fact , Facebook users now outnumber the population of China . MGI estimates that 914 million people have at least one international connection on social media , and 360 million take part in cross-border e-commerce . For businesses , these open platforms create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built-in ways to reach them . Already 12% of the global goods trade is cross-border e-commerce , and half of the world 's traded services are delivered digitally . These transformations enable small and medium-sized enterprises around the world to compete head to head with larger industry incumbents . <p> Companies now have unprecedented opportunities to achieve both global scale and efficiency . But to realize them , many will have to she 'd old assumptions , particularly in the five areas outlined below . <p> Rethink your global footprint and organizational structures . Multinationals once expanded by building a replica of their entire firm in each country where they operated . The result was often a global organization bogged down with redundancy , additional costs , and a fragmented corporate culture . But now digital technologies allow companies to globalize in a leaner and less capital-intensive way . By creating virtual teams that collaborate remotely , companies can expand into new markets without losing agility . They have greater flexibility to hire specialized talent and follow pockets of demand growth wherever they find them . Functions such as human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency on overarching issues while regional managers control decisions such as hiring . One option is to establish global hubs for some backbone operations in combination with smaller sales and marketing teams around the world . Companies that deliver digital goods and services can go even further , entering new international markets without establishing a physical presence at all . When Netflix created a subscription model for online streaming , it was able to add customers in 190 countries by using the public cloud . <p> Consider how global value chains are evolving . Companies have an opportunity to redraw supply chains and customer channels as digital globalization redraws industry value chains . Massive global platforms open up new possibilities for procurement , allowing a manufacturer in Tennessee to find the best deal on components from a small supplier in Thailand .

Some use control towers that look straight out of NASA mission control ; these systems synthesize information from sensors , actuators , RFID tags , GPS tracking , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some companies are emphasizing speed to market and are moving away from the complexity of long global supply chains altogether " and if 3D printing is adopted more widely , it could change the very definition of what constitutes an intermediate good . <p> Sharpen product strategies for a more digitally connected world . Some companies that sell into a range of global markets have deep product portfolios with tailored offerings that appeal to local consumer preferences and are sensitive to their price points . Digital tools can provide the kind of granular market insights needed to make this approach successful and manage the resulting operational complexity . But many companies , particularly in tech , take the one-world , one-product approach . Apple offers just three models of its iPhone and iPad , all with consistent design and branding no matter where they are sold . Google has search , mapping , and email products that are not designed with any particular set of regional customers in mind . Facebook , Uber , Airbnb , and various e-commerce marketplaces have simply scaled up their digital platforms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is now the era of global product launches , and Hollywood is at the forefront . For many years , studios waited until after a movie 's U.S. run to release it overseas , where the foreign box office could still compensate for domestic disappointments . The highest-grossing movie of 1995 , Die Hard : With a Vengeance , was screening in only three countries within ten days of its U.S. release date . In 2015 , Star Wars : The Force Awakens launched in 80 countries during its first week , and more than half of its record-breaking debut weekend box office came from overseas . The information transparency offered by the internet also means that consumers around the world can see reviews immediately . There is no longer an opportunity to tweak and remarket ; if a movie bombs in one place , it will be a global bomb . This kind of strategy increasingly applies beyond the multiplex . Companies in media , fashion , and trend-driven consumer industries are willing to bet big because the flip side of the risk is the ultimate prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global scale . <p> Understand the new competitive landscape . The competitive landscape is growing more unpredictable as digital platforms such as Amazon , Alibaba , and eBay are empowering companies of any size , from anywhere on earth , to roll out products quickly and deliver them to new markets . The internet is ramping up pricing pressures , shortening product cycles , and creating a more global labor market in which companies have to compete for scarce technical and managerial talent .

Indeed , on May 18 the Trump administration notified the U.S. Congress of its intent to begin the process . My firm , Frontier Strategy Group ( FSG ) , expects that formal talks will begin in late August or early September , after the required 90-day waiting period . Both Canada and Mexico are hoping that adjustments to the trade agreement will deepen integration rather than promote protectionist economic policies ; the Trump administration has provided conflicting signals over what kind of measures it will pursue . <p> The Trump administration may no longer be advocating for 25% tariffs on manufacturing imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trade policies that would severely cripple the benefits offered for multinationals under the current trade agreement . For example , a key source of concern for some companies is more-restrictive rules of origin , which would reduce the amount of materials allowed to be used tariff-free for products traded to and from NAFTA member countries . This would amount to higher tariffs for inputs or final goods , which , though unlikely to reach the 25% tariff levels suggested during Trump 's campaign , would still raise costs for multinationals and further inhibit cross-national supply chain integration . <p> However , new tariffs or more-restrictive rules of origin would likely only fall on a few industries , such as the automotive sector . More companies are concerned that their current supply chain would be more vulnerable to unilateral protectionist measures , such as lower standards for import safeguards . So , if a company manufactures products in Mexico to export to Canada and the U.S. ( and vice versa ) and can no longer take for granted continued and uninterrupted access to each other 's markets , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would likely lead to closing factories , seeking new sources for inputs , and raising prices to mitigate higher production cuts . <p> Multinationals are heavily pushing for either minor tweaking to the agreement or a modernization of NAFTA . Companies would like to see process improvements and better infrastructure at the border to reduce costs to import . Firms in innovation-driven industries , such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices , have long supported greater standardization across borders , with stronger intellectual property protections and enforcement of regulatory standards . Possibly the greatest improvement to the current trade agreement would come from incorporating industries that were relatively nascent when NAFTA was first negotiated ( such as e-commerce and the digital industry ) , industries that were nationalized at the time ( such as Mexico 's energy sector ) , or industries in the service sector ( such as the insurance , accounting , and express delivery industries ) . These changes would allow for greater standardization across borders , allowing for better access to each other 's markets and increased trade . A revamped NAFTA that incorporates even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most multinationals " but this would be somewhat counter to the protectionist rhetoric that the Trump administration has previously voiced . <p> An agreement that expands NAFTA is more likely to be negotiated and implemented relatively quickly , while an agreement that incorporates new protectionist measures , especially on discretionary import safeguards and tariffs , would likely be prolonged and contentious . FSG predicts that the renegotiation of NAFTA will incorporate at least some modernization measures mentioned before , particularly those that were previously negotiated under the Trans-Pacific Partnership , but that the Trump administration will push for new import controls , which would prolong a final agreement . The bottom line is , multinationals will not know what will be in the final agreement for years . <h> Growing Populist Movement in Mexico <p> Multinational executives are also paying attention to the country 's upcoming presidential elections . Mediocre growth , continued narco-related violence , and persistent corruption have crippled the electorate 's confidence in the status quo . The current government of Enrique Pea Nieto suffers from record-low approval ratings ( link in Spanish ) , making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency . <p> In mid-February FSG surveyed 25 Mexico country managers of multinationals and found that half of them expected the center-right 's candidate , which is likely to be either Margarita Zavala , the first lady during Felipe Calderon 's presidency ( from 2006 to 2012 ) , or Ricardo Anaya , the current president of center-right National Action Party ( PAN ) , to win the next presidential election in Mexico . <p> However , leftist candidate and former mayor of Mexico City AndrTs Manuel L=pez Obrador is considered the frontrunner in most recent polls , and his populist agenda is considered to be at least somewhat harmful by most of these same executives . Multinational executives fear that his populist programs ( such as to implement massive increases in social spending while eschewing tax increases ) would severely destabilize Mexico 's already fragile public finances , and that his opposition to the current administration 's structural reforms , particularly in energy and labor , will drive down investments in the market , cause further peso devaluations , and lead to greater confrontation with the Trump administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but companies should avoid panicking over his election . If he wins with only a narrow victory , as seems likely , his administration would have a limited mandate for populist reforms that would severely damage foreign investment flows and public finances . His MORENA party remains unlikely to win a clear majority in Mexico 's Congress , which would force him to either moderate his expansionary fiscal policy or face perpetual legislative gridlock from a more conservative Congress . Mexico 's economic performance is n't likely to significantly improve over the 2% YOY average of the last few decades , but this would not necessarily lead to a major economic downturn . <p> Of course , a narrow victory for L=pez Obrador is not guaranteed . If the center-right PAN candidate wins , whether it is Zavala or Anaya , it would likely help cement business 's confidence in the country 's economic and political stability . <h> Navigating the Next Two Years in Mexico <p> Many of the companies we work with that have operations in Mexico have taken up scenario planning to prepare for a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could affect their businesses . Most Mexico country managers believe one of the following scenarios is likely : <p> A long period of populist-driven uncertainty .

FSG expects that the Mexican peso would depreciate to 22 MXP/US$ over the next two years and that the economy would average growth of 1.8% YOY in 2017 " 2018 . Multinationals anticipating this scenario have delayed major capital investments ( including new factories and distribution centers ) , pursued a cautious approach to price increases ( despite rising pressure on margins from a stronger dollar ) , and increased investments in monitoring customer spending patterns and on lobbying and regulatory support in Mexico and the U.S. <p> The status quo persists . In this case , NAFTA negotiations remain undecided beyond Mexico 's 2018 elections , but the populist surge fails to materialize in the country and the center-right PAN narrowly defeats L=pez Obrador . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20.5 MXP/US$ over the next two years and the economy should grow closer to 2.1% YOY in 2017 " 2018 . Executives who are planning against this scenario are continuing to urge corporate headquarters to invest in the Mexican market , while monitoring the evolution of trade talks and resourcing lobbying efforts in Mexico and the United States . <p> Beyond these two scenarios , most multinationals want their teams to prepare for potential upside and downside scenarios : <p> A pro-business turn . If NAFTA is renegotiated relatively quickly and largely avoids protectionist measures , this would help shore up investments in Mexico and boost prospects for a center-right PAN candidacy to win next year 's elections . This would help keep the peso at an average 19.5 MXP/US$ , while economic growth could increase to an average of 2.7% YOY over the next two years . Under this scenario , multinationals would redouble on previously paused investments , increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity in Mexico in particular and integrating shared services across the border . Furthermore , sales and profitability targets would need to be raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in domestic demand were to occur . <p> A tit-for-tat trade war . If negotiations break down over NAFTA , it would create severe disruptions for the Mexican economy and open the door for populism to take hold . Economic growth would fall to -1.5% YOY in 2017 " 2018 , while the Mexican peso would fall to 25 MXP/US$ over the next two years . In this scenario , which most now deem highly unlikely , multinationals would require a full strategic reset for their short-term operating plans . Companies would have to reassess the weakness of their current supply chain structure , raise prices due to the higher cost of imported goods , and significantly reduce sales targets . If trade conflict persisted , multinationals would need to begin reducing head count and deprioritizing the Mexican market , not just as a manufacturing platform for the U.S. market but also as a priority market in their global portfolios . 
@@37681321 @6681321/ <h> What Companies Can Do When Work and Religion Conflict <p> Since 2007 , the number of complaints for religious discrimination filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) has risen significantly . It 's not hard to see why : An increase in immigrants of diverse faiths , greater workforce diversity , and the globalization of business all play a role in more workers from different religious backgrounds meeting on the job . For many employers , it is only a matter of time before they face conflicts between religion and work . <p> To resolve such conflicts , managers must frame the issues carefully and consider the long-term effects of their decisions . How they act can either improve morale by affirming an inclusive culture or it can suggest that religion is merely tolerated " and possibly invite litigation . <p> Consider what happened recently at a Cargill facility in Fort Morgan , Colorado . While some of the facts remain unknown , it appears that 11 Muslim workers of Somali descent wanted to pray at the same time in one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How exactly this request was handled is in dispute . According to one version , the workers ' supervisor asked them to go in smaller groups in order not to disrupt production on the assembly line . Another version claims that management had decided to cut down on prayer breaks . The workers prayed in small groups and at the end of their shift , 10 of the 11 quit . Ultimately , 150 Muslim workers missed work for three days in protest , and Cargill fired them for failing to inform the company that they would be absent . About 130 of the fired workers have filed a complaint with the EEOC . <p> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits , among other things , religious discrimination in any facet of employment . Not only must employers not treat workers differently based on their religion , but when a conflict arises between a religious practice and a workplace policy , employers must also try to accommodate the employee . <p> Employees have a responsibility to give their employer notice of an actual conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The burden on the employer is not very heavy : Any accommodation can not be unreasonably expensive , compromise workplace safety , decrease efficiency , or require other employees to do more than their share of dangerous or burdensome work . Moreover , an accommodation does not have to fit the employee 's ideal scenario or even match what the employee asked for . <p> Workers and employers alike have incentives to reach a compromise . Otherwise , they are both likely to suffer . In Fort Morgan , the once-tight-knit immigrant community is in turmoil as families and neighbors leave . And Cargill still has not been able to fill all of the Muslim workers ' vacant jobs . <p> To prevent disagreements over religious accommodations boiling over into conflict , companies can take several simple steps : <p> Make the equal treatment of all employees regardless of traits like religion a mandate . Of course , the law prohibits different treatment based on religion . But including the tenet of equal treatment and respect in the firm 's code of ethics demonstrates the company 's commitment to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of that tenet and consistently enforce it . Show employees that the code of ethics is not just something that lives on paper . <p> Review and refine policies for different religious practices .

The Cargill facility had specific staffing requirements on the assembly line . Other types of business can anticipate staffing and productivity issues , for example , during tax season , earnings reporting , or the holiday retail rush . <p> Conflict avoidance and ethics are n't the only reason to work toward solutions to religious accommodations . A recent study shows that workers who feel religiously comfortable in the workplace have higher job satisfaction .

Ask them if they are good coaches , and almost as many will say yes . Executives we talk to assume that if they 're good managers , then being a good coach is like your shadow on a sunny day . It just naturally follows . <p> This would be good news , if it were so , since more and more top executives are expecting managers to coach their subordinates . In fact one at Wells Fargo announced that he expects the bank 's managers to dedicate fully two-thirds of their time to coaching subordinates . <p> What 's more , employee surveys we 've conducted over the past decade show that subordinates want coaching . Our own empirical evidence echoes myriad studies in finding that effective coaching raises employee commitment and engagement , productivity , retention rates , customer loyalty , and subordinates ' perception of the strength of upper-level leadership . Responses we 've collected over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluating about 50,000 of their managers in 360 reviews , show just about a perfect correlation between the leaders ' effectiveness in developing others and the level of their subordinates ' engagement and discretionary effort : <p> Unfortunately , our long experience helping executives find and develop their strengths has taught us that coaching is not something that comes naturally to everyone . Nor is it a skill that is automatically acquired in the course of learning to manage . And done poorly , it can cause a lot of harm . <p> What 's more , before they can be taught coaching skills , leaders need to possess some fundamental attributes , many of which are not common managerial strengths . Indeed , some run counter to the behaviors and attributes that get people promoted to managerial positions in the first place . Here are a few of the attributes we have recently begun to measure in an effort to determine what might predict who would make the most effective coaches . You 'll quickly see the conflict between traditional management practices and good coaching traits : <p> Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groups they manage , of course , and the willingness to exert leadership is often why they get promoted . But the most effective managers who are also effective coaches learn to be selective about giving direction . Rather than use their conversations as an opportunity to exert a strong influence , make recommendations , and provide unambiguous direction , they take a step back , and try to draw out the views of their talented , experienced staff . <p> A desire to give advice or to aid in discovery . Subordinates frequently ask managers questions about how they should handle various issues or resolve specific problems . And managers are often promoted to their positions because they are exceptionally good at solving problems . So no one should be surprised to find that many are quick to give advice , rather than taking time to help colleagues or subordinates discover the best solution from within themselves . The best coaches do a little of both . <p> An inclination to act as the expert or as an equal . We 've all seen instances when the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisory or managerial position . Organizations want leaders to understand their technology . So , naturally , when coaching others , some managers behave as if they possess far greater wisdom than the person being coached . But in assuming the role of guru , the well-meaning manager may treat the person being coached as a novice , or even a child . Still , the excellent coach does not behave as a complete equal , with no special role , valued perspective , or responsibility in the conversation . <p> How effective is your approach to coaching ? We invite you take a coaching evaluation to see where you stand in comparison to outstanding business coaches . It will measure the how strongly you prefer to behave collaboratively or dictatorially , how prone you are to giving advice or enabling other people to discover answers for themselves , and how apt you are to exert your expertise or treat everyone as equals . While certainly the best coaches adjust their style to the particular person and situation at hand , we have found that there are ideal ranges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neuroscience is consistently reminding us that the brain is remarkably plastic . So even though we 've found a strong correlation between certain traits you may not already possess and the ability to be an effective coach , we have found that people can learn to acquire them " if they are willing to work at it . What that takes is a willingness to step outside your comfort zone and behave in ways that may not be familiar . It 's just like learning to play golf or tennis . What feels awkward at first begins to be more comfortable in time . <p> Leaders can learn to be more collaborative as opposed to always being directive . They can learn the skill of helping people to discover solutions rather than always first offering advice . They can learn how satisfying it is to treat others with consummate respect and to recognize that in today 's workforce , it is not unusual to have subordinates who are more comfortable with the latest technology than their leaders are . 
@@37681379 @6681379/ <h> Employees Perform Better When They Can Control Their Space <p> If you want to build a culture of high performance , start by taking a look at your office environment . It matters more than you may realize . <p> As co-CEO of the design and architectural firm Gensler , I 've spent my career designing workplaces and studying the link between design and business performance . Our firm 's four decades of collective experience and research indicate that an optimal physical environment can serve as a foundation for an effective workforce . <p> We wanted to take a deeper look at some of the more abstract aspects of workplace design that can impact employee performance . An emerging suite of literature and research " including our 2013 Workplace Survey " clearly points to the power of choice and autonomy to drive not only employee happiness , but also motivation and performance . We found that knowledge workers whose companies allow them to help decide when , where , and how they work were more likely to be satisfied with their jobs , performed better , and viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer such choices . <p> Our research also found that tech employees are also happier and more satisfied in their jobs and with their workplaces , than average . <p> Why are they so satisfied ? Choice was a key differentiator : Forty-one percent of the technology employee respondents reported having a say in when and where they work " which includes both in- and out-of-office mobility " compared to only 32 percent on average . <p> Facebook is a prime example . At their headquarters , employees have the ability to tailor the layout , height , and configuration of their own desks based on personal preference . Teams can also create whatever workspace layout best supports their project , moving desks into a circular break-out space or a long row of desks , for example . There are also vast arrays of meeting spaces across the campus available to all employees . And Facebook offers a range of options to employees for managing their personal lives and time , ranging from the transactional ( banks , cleaners ) to the social ( restaurants , arcades ) and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This additional layer of choice may not seem immediately work-related , but the ability to create and control one 's entire day as the needs of work dictate puts employees squarely in control of their own time management , productivity and processes . This has been shown to lead to greater organizational productivity and suggests that meeting an employee 's need for autonomy can influence motivation and performance . <p> Not every company can offer choice to employees on the same scale . But all organizations should carefully consider what they can do to give employees the spaces and tools that enhance and support their workday tasks as well as corporate goals . Choice is not a one-size-fits-all approach . Rather , it 's specific to the organization and its needs . <p> The recent Yahoo ! recall seems to indicate that the organization 's remote work policy was no longer a type of choice that supported Marissa Mayer 's stated goal of enhancing innovation .

The firm literally and figuratively brought the walls down to encourage collaboration across divisions , increase productivity , and enable their employees to work in a whole new way . <p> Workplace choice is just one part of a broader culture of autonomy .

Dramatic currency fluctuations , depressed prices on commodities such as oil and copper , and sluggish demand from China and Europe ( Africa 's largest trade partners ) have put pressure on the region 's economies . While SSA was predicted to grow above 5% year-over-year in 2015 at the beginning of the year , actual GDP growth is more likely to come in at around 3 " 4% year-over-year . Growth in 2016 is unlikely to be much higher . <p> However , although some of our clients have been facing difficulties resulting from the current environment , primarily because of currency pressures , many others are continuing to see strong growth , even in troubled markets such as South Africa and Angola .

Businesses will have to adapt to withstand slower and more variable growth across SSA . <p> To understand which markets will be more successful in weathering economic challenges and providing sustainable growth to multinational companies , my company , Frontier Strategy Group , developed a Sub-Saharan Africa Resilience to External Shocks Index ( RESI ) . It assesses SSA markets ' socioeconomic fundamentals and internal strength by looking at measures of political stability , trade exposure , economic diversification , wealth , and productivity . <p> In our index , countries receive a score from 0 to 100 , with 100 indicating highest relative resilience . Resilience is tied to a country 's ability to maintain economic and political stability despite external shocks , due to stronger fundamentals , internal buffers , and self-sufficiency . By incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analysis that looks at historical developments and our analysts ' projections , the RESI allows for a nuanced understanding of market resilience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Africa rank highly as a result of their comparatively sound political environments and strong human capital . East African markets perform well because their dependence on commodities is low and , as oil importers , they benefit from the low price of fuel . Francophone West African markets rank well because regional currencies are less volatile , as they are pegged to the Euro . <p> Even though Nigeria is the region 's largest oil exporter , it emerges as resilient because its economy is far more diversified than commonly assumed . The services , retail , transport , and construction sectors make up a large share of GDP , and the country 's vast film industry , Nollywood , is good for commercial activity in the country outside oil and gas . <p> However , Angola , the other large oil exporter in the region , ranks close to the bottom because its economy is not diversified .

They display robust growth across sectors and are benefiting from good governance , sound political reforms , and improving business environments . East African markets Kenya , Uganda , and Tanzania also enjoy strong trade integration with each other , which gives the region additional scale , as it allows businesses to easily operate across borders . <p> And despite subdued growth rates compared to historical levels , Nigeria remains by far the largest market across different industries and one of the most resilient markets .

On the other hand , while South Africa , one of the region 's more well-known markets , remains resilient , growth will disappoint over the next few years as a result of poor governance , subdued demand for its exports , and a decaying power infrastructure . <h> Businesses Have to Adapt Their Strategies to the New Normal <p> This new normal will require companies to adjust their execution strategies . Firms have to assess market resilience and opportunity with their products and industry in mind . Opportunity will look very different for a company selling medical devices and a consumer goods company selling chewing gum . The medical devices firm may decide to focus on South Africa , despite the low-growth environment , because the budget spent on health care is still considerably large there .

For example , because local businesses face financial pressure in less-resilient markets , there are attractive M&amp;A opportunities for companies willing to take on greater risk . However , if these investments are unlikely to yield the desired result , reallocating resources to other , more attractive opportunities may be a better option . <p> Smaller , less-attractive markets should be consolidated into clusters to cut costs and resources .

@@37681418 @6681418/ <h> When to Give Feedback in a Group and When to Do It One-on-One <p> If you 're like most leaders , you 're probably reluctant to give an individual feedback in a team meeting . You 've probably learned to praise in public and criticize in private . You may be concerned that if you give feedback in a group setting , you 'll put that person on the spot , get him or her defensive , make everyone else in the room uncomfortable , and strain the team 's working relationships . That 's why leaders tend to focus on the risks of giving feedback in a team , but miss the risks of inappropriately giving feedback one-on-one . <p> Giving feedback in the right setting is important . It affects your team 's performance , working relationships and well-being . Here are some guidelines and explanations for when to give feedback in a team setting , and when to offer it one-one one : <h> Give feedback in a team setting when : <p> One or more team members are experiencing negative consequences caused by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedback . <p> The issue involves most of the team . <p> People need feedback about their behavior directly from those who have first-hand information . Only these team members can validate the feedback and fully answer the inevitable questions about the effects of the behavior being discussed . For example , if you are giving feedback to your direct report Carla about how her teammates are n't able to meet their deadlines because she 's giving them low-quality work , you wo n't be able to answer Carla 's questions about her teammates concerns " only they will . <h> Further Reading <p> It 's even worse when you give feedback to Carla and do n't tell her who is concerned about the quality of her work . By granting Carla 's teammates confidentiality , you not only prevent her from getting answers that would help her to fully change her behavior , you also contribute to mistrust between team members who are unwilling to address their concerns with each other . <p> In either case , unless the problem is a simple one , you 'll likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if Carla does agree that the quality of her work is suffering , she may believe that it is due " at least in part " to other teammates . Remember that a team is a system of interdependent individuals working together to accomplish a task . Solving a team-level problem with only one or two team members will usually just create new problems . <p> Even if you are able to solve the performance problem by speaking only with Carla , you will still have contributed to strained working relationships . Carla and her teammates who privately complained to you about her will all know this open secret and it will undermine team trust . <h> Give feedback one-on-one when : <p> Other team members are not being affected by the behavior and have no information to provide . <p> You want to help the team member prepare for receiving team feedback or coach the team member after receiving feedback from other team members . <p> Giving feedback in a team setting when others are n't being affected or do n't have information to share will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wasted . The team member receiving the feedback will justifiably feel called out . If only one team member is directly experiencing the negative consequences of another 's behavior , it 's better to have those two people speak in private . <p> It 's appropriate to help prepare someone for a team feedback conversation . This enables you to explain your reasoning for addressing it in the team setting and to help the individual prepare for both receiving and giving feedback in the meeting . It 's also helpful to coach the person after the team meeting , identifying what he needs to do to create any change he agreed to in the team meeting . These meetings are in addition to " not a substitute for " feedback in the team setting . <p> Do not decide on the feedback setting based on how comfortable you or other team members are giving feedback in a team setting or how comfortable you assume the team member is receiving feedback in a team setting . Comfort is overrated . The job of leaders " whether team leaders or team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are feeling uncomfortable . <p> Underlying this approach is the principle that team members are accountable for giving feedback directly to those with whom they are interdependent . Apart from team members doing their own work , this is the most basic form of team accountability . Leaders are continually exhorting their employees to work as a team and to be accountable to the team . But , if you always provide the feedback , you take away the opportunity for your direct reports to develop this essential skill , and you undermine the accountability required to function as a team . <p> If you 're thinking that it makes sense to give feedback on team issues in a team setting , but you 're concerned that your team does n't have the skills to do this , you 're not alone . Many leaders share this concern . You can begin changing this by talking with your team about how you expect team members to be accountable to each other " not just to you or the larger organization . If you share your expectations for your direct reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give your team the skills to meet the agreed-upon expectation , you 'll find that problems get addressed sooner , fewer issues land on your own desk , and your team becomes a more productive , cohesive unit .

Sixteen years later , that dominance is looking threadbare . The reason is failed leadership , and Apple " currently the dominant tech firm for the mobile era " is at risk of making the same mistakes . <p> After running Microsoft for 25 years , Bill Gates handed the reins of CEO to Steve Ballmer in January 2000 . Ballmer went on to run Microsoft for the next 14 years . If you think the job of a CEO is to increase sales , then Ballmer did a spectacular job . He tripled Microsoft 's sales to $78 billion and profits more than doubled from $9 billion to $22 billion . The launch of the Xbox and Kinect , and the acquisitions of Skype and Yammer happened on his shift . If the Microsoft board was managing for quarter-to-quarter or even year-to year-revenue growth , Ballmer was as good as it gets as a CEO . But if the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make the argument that he was a failure as CEO , as he optimized short-term gains by squandering long-term opportunities . <p> Despite Microsoft 's remarkable financial performance , Ballmer failed to understand and execute on the five most important technology trends of the 21st century : in search " losing to Google ; in smartphones " losing to Apple ; in mobile operating systems " losing to Google/Apple ; in media " losing to Apple/Netflix ; and in the cloud " losing to Amazon . Microsoft ended the 20th century owning over 95% of the operating systems that ran on computers ( almost all on desktops ) . Fifteen years in to the 21st century , 2 billion smartphones had shipped , and Microsoft 's mobile OS share is 1% . These misses were n't in some tangential markets " search , mobile , and the cloud were where Microsoft users were heading . Yet a very smart CEO missed all of these . Why ? <p> It was n't that Microsoft did n't have smart engineers working on search , media , mobile , and cloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ballmer organized the company around execution of its current strengths , the Windows and Office businesses . Projects not directly related to those activities never got serious resource or management attention . <p> For Microsoft to have tackled the areas they missed " cloud , music , mobile , apps " would have required an organizational transformation into a services company . And services have a very different business model . They are hard to do in a company that excels at products . <p> Ballmer was a world-class executor ( a Harvard grad and world-class salesman ) of an existing business model trying to manage in a world of increasing change and disruption . Microsoft executed its 20th-century business model extremely well , but it missed the new and more important ones . The result ? Great short-term gains but long-term prospects that are far less compelling . <p> In 2014 , Microsoft finally announced that Ballmer would retire , and in early 2014 , Satya Nadella took charge . Nadella got Microsoft organized around mobile and the cloud ( Azure ) , freed the Office and Azure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a major release of Windows out without the usual trauma . He is moving the company into augmented reality and conversational AI . While they 'll likely never regain the market dominance they had in the 20th century , their legacy business model has continued to be extremely profitable , and Nadella has likely saved Microsoft from irrelevance . <p> And that brings us to Apple , Tim Cook and the Apple board . <p> One of the strengths of visionary CEOs is that they build an executive staff of world-class operating executives ( and that they unconsciously force out the world-class innovators among their direct reports ) . In a company driven by a visionary CEO , there is only one visionary . <p> While Steve Jobs ran Apple , he drove the vision but put strong operating execs in each domain " hardware , software , product design , supply chain , manufacturing " who translated his vision and impatience into plans , process , and procedures . Between 2001 to 2008 , Jobs reinvented the company three times . Each transformation " from a new computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the iPod and iTunes in 2001 ; to the iPhone in 2007 ; to the App Store in 2008 " drove revenues and profits to new heights . <p> When visionary founders depart , the operating executives who reported to them believe it 's their turn to run the company ( often with the blessing of the ex-CEO ) . At Microsoft , Bill Gates anointed Steve Ballmer , and at Apple , Steve Jobs made it clear that Tim Cook was to be his successor . <p> Once in charge , one of the first things these operations/execution CEOs do is to get rid of the chaos and turbulence in the organization . Execution CEOs value stability , process , and repeatable execution . That 's great for predictability , but it often starts a creative death spiral . Creative people start to leave , and other executors are put into more senior roles , hiring more process people , which in turn forces out the remaining creative talent . This culture shift ripples down from the top and what often felt like a company on a mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As process oriented as the new CEOs are , you get the sense that one of the things they do n't love are the products ( go look at the Apple Watch announcements and see who demos it ) . <p> Tim Cook has now run Apple for five years , long enough for it to be his company rather than Jobs 's . The parallel between Gates and Ballmer and Jobs and Cook is eerie . Apple under Cook has doubled its revenues to $200 billion while doubling profit and tripling the amount of cash it has in the bank ( now a quarter of a trillion dollars ) . The iPhone continues its annual upgrades of incremental improvements . Yet in five years the only new thing Apple managed to get out the door is the Watch . Apple has 115,000 employees yet can barely get annual updates out for their laptops and desktop computers . <p> But the world is about to disrupt Apple in the same way that Microsoft was disrupted under Ballmer . Apple brilliantly mastered user interface and product design to power the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the next of wave of computing products will be AI-directed services " machine intelligence driving apps and hardware .

@@37681455 @6681455/ <h> When Sensory Marketing Works and When it Backfires <p> If you 've ever picked up a product and took note of how it feels in your hand , you understand the power of sensory marketing . Manufacturers understand it too , which is why tactile information like the famous contour of a Coca-Cola bottle or the textured burlap packaging of Marfa brand soaps are unique and memorable . Some manufacturers also incorporate smell , as in the scratch-and-sniff packaging by Glade and Tide , while others rely on color , such as the trademark brown of UPS or the robin 's egg blue of Tiffany &amp; Co . <p> In each of these examples the brand 's sensory information means something to the consumer , and for many brands the combination of sight , touch , sound , smell , and taste is what creates and maintains the brand 's image or personality in a consumer 's mind . Some combinations evoke excitement " think of the ubiquitous Nike swoosh ; others emphasize a feeling of sincerity , as in the timeless style of L.L. Bean . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luna bars are for women , for example . <p> But brands are experimenting with sensory information in ways consumers might not expect . In the UK , McCain Foods ran a campaign where it released the aroma of baked potatoes in bus shelters . In South Korea , Dunkin Donuts used an atomizer to release a coffee aroma whenever the company 's jingle was played on municipal buses . These tactics are purportedly done to elicit surprise and engage the consumer in a context not normally associated with such aromas . Dunkin Donuts claimed it saw a 29% increase in sales during the experiment . <p> However , customers will not receive such tactics positively for all brands in all situations . So how do we know when people will accept situations with brand sensory information " and when they wo n't ? <p> There is very little research on this question , but we have begun to explore this idea and have theorized that consumers intuitively link a brand 's packaging and marketing tactics to their broader preconceptions of the brand 's personality . <p> We conducted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented people with products packaged in such a way that they either looked and felt textured , or they looked textured but felt like something else . On the whole , we found that people tended to prefer sincere brands ( Hallmark , Ford , Coca-Cola ) when the brand 's packaging or promotional accessories felt and looked the same , but they preferred exciting brands ( Mountain Dew , BMW , Pepsi ) when the brand 's packaging or promotional accessories did not feel and look the same . <p> In fact , our initial studies revealed that consumers actually punished sincere brands by expressing less desire to purchase the product , even when the sensory tactic revealed superior quality ( e.g. , the product 's packaging or promotional accessory looked plastic but was actually metal ) . Consumers rewarded exciting brands by expressing a greater desire to purchase the product , even when the sensory marketing tactic revealed inferior quality ( e.g. , the product packaging or promotional tactic looked metal but was actually plastic ) . <p> We wanted to understand why this happened . We dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensory marketing tactics but not when actual production materials were altered on the core product concept . <p> In our final study , we tested all top smartphone manufacturers and found that Apple was seen as the most exciting , whereas Nokia was seen as the most sincere . So we built a new smartphone that combined elements from the Apple iPhone 6 and the Nokia Lumia 925 ( which are very similar in design ) . We then marketed the phone as either an Apple product or a Nokia product , using each brand logo . We approached consumers in a mall and asked them to engage with the product as part of the promotional campaign . <p> The phone was designed so that it looked plastic . However , when consumers touched the new phone , they found that it was made of either metal , cardboard fiber , or ( as they expected ) plastic . We then did the same with the smartphones ' bumper case as a promotional piece , offering consumers the case as part of the incentive to purchase the phone . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find that it , too , was or was n't what they expected . <p> We found that when the phone looked and felt as expected ( plastic ) consumers focused on whether the promotional tactic matched their preconceptions of the brand . In the case of Apple ( our exciting brand ) , consumers wanted the phone more when its promotional bumper case violated their sensory expectations ( i.e. , when it was assumed to be plastic but turned out to be metal or cardboard , despite cardboard being seen as inferior ) . In the case of Nokia ( our sincere brand ) , consumers wanted the phone more when its promotional tactic delivered exactly what was expected ( a plastic bumper case ) , despite the metal bumper being seen as inferior . <p> When the phone itself was made out of metal , cardboard , or plastic , consumers did n't match the material to the brand . They intuitively liked the ( superior ) metal finish to the ( inferior ) cardboard finish , regardless of whether they were holding an Apple- or Nokia-branded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material would impact the product 's functionality . It seemed that only when sensory marketing was seen as a tactic done by the brand , as opposed to as an alteration in manufacturing , did consumers care more about whether the tactic felt right , given what they knew about the brand . <p> This suggests that companies like Apple , which carry a general perception of excitement and innovation , have far more latitude to play with tactics that surprise and engage the consumer , but companies like Nokia , which carry a general perception of consistency and dependability , may directly compromise these perceptions with such tactics . <p> Our research provides some of the first evidence that consumer preference can indeed be altered by sensory marketing tactics . At the same time , the effectiveness of a tactic is highly dependent on a brand 's personality . This suggests that marketers should n't take uniform positions on sensory marketing across a variety of product lines ; instead , each product must strategically consider its positioning in the marketplace . And marketers should not fall for the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For your packaging to evoke the right narrative , it must be designed intentionally . Consider how innovation in packaging would communicate to your consumer in the larger scheme of your brand 's perceived personality . Above all , remember to design accordingly .

@@37681463 @6681463/ <h> The Skills Doctors and Nurses Need to Be Effective Executives <p> We are witnessing an unprecedented transformation of the health care industry . There has been a rapid growth in jobs and an explosion in the number of start-ups . There are new types of insurance companies such as Oscar ; novel provider organizations such as OneMedical , IoraHealth , and ChenMed ; and new health information technology companies such as Castlight , Vital , and WellFrame that aim to use technology to improve care and value . Physicians and nurses are being called upon to lead these new health care enterprises " and are assuming a higher level of influence in the business of health care than ever before . <p> Maximizing the effectiveness of physicians and nurses in these new positions , however , will require different skills than the ones they developed during their clinical training . Having managed or worked with clinical leaders in care-delivery organizations , the pharmaceutical industry , and government , I have observed three skills that are critical to the success of doctors and nurses as they make the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians and nurses excel at operations management because it requires the same kind of detail and complexity that is required to effectively manage a large clinical load . In clinical work , we must constantly triage patients and parse significant amounts of low and high-level detail . Many clinicians manage a small operation in the form of their own clinical practice or ward before shifting to leading larger operations . <p> Still , many clinicians struggle with operations management because they fail to appropriately distinguish between urgent tasks and important , non-urgent tasks " often letting the latter fall by the wayside in favor of the former . Just as a first-year resident physician or a fresh nursing graduate must learn to manage his or her own workflows and develop a plan of attack to manage a patient 's issues , so too must a new clinician executive learn to act with urgency and ownership to build an organization 's workflows and address its problems . Clinician leaders should recognize this potential gap in perspective and work actively to make sure that tasks are appropriately triaged by priority level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership position , many clinicians have never hired or fired anyone in their life . The instincts crucial to deciding whom to hire and how to hire them managing others ' performance are often underdeveloped in clinical leaders . For example , many clinicians , by nature and by training , are kind and compassionate . While these qualities help engender loyalty , they often make some of the difficult conversations associated with managing people especially challenging . <p> To accelerate the development of their people-management skills , clinicians should partner closely with fellow business leaders and HR professionals . These colleagues can be instrumental in helping them surface their needs and identify tactics to build and manage high-performance teams . These colleagues can also serve as sounding boards when they must make hard decisions and hold inevitable hard conversations . <p> Setting and defining strategy . Many clinician leaders are drawn to roles in which they can actively work to define organizational structure and strategy . While strategy roles often tap the strengths and deep frontline knowledge of clinicians , executives with clinician backgrounds often forget that creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of activities is often a decision not to pursue another . Strategy guru and Michael Porter of Harvard Business School elegantly articulated this when he wrote that strategy is both what we choose to do " and what we choose not to do . Clinicians must work to develop organizational strategies with this simple and important maxim constantly in mind . <p> One CEO with whom I have worked remarked that physicians and nurses run the risk of losing their clinical identities as they develop into executives . It would be a shame if they did .

Her options were narrowing and there was a point at which she considered not moving forward at all with treatment . But then , Mary decided to contact a patient navigator for help , and what started as a counseling call became a new lifeline . Mary 's patient navigator helped her understand her treatment options , coordinated and attended her appointments and helped renew Mary 's will to move forward . <p> MetroHealth began its patient navigation program to help patients , especially underinsured ones , through the barriers that often impede their ability to obtain care . These barriers are not just financial ; they can also be logistical , emotional and even cultural . And in today 's healthcare environment , these barriers often go unaddressed . For instance , patients may not understand their course of treatment , where to go for treatment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may worry about who will watch their children and how they will pay for their prescriptions . Without answers to these basic questions , some patients give up . <p> With their expertise in handling patients ' needs and their understanding of the healthcare process , patient navigators can provide those answers and ensure that patients are getting the care they need . Navigators work directly with patients and their families , building a trust-based relationship rooted in an understanding of the patient 's community , culture , values and lifestyle . With that knowledge , patient navigators generally can assist patients with the logistics of their care : from managing appointments , completing medical forms and exploring funding options to making arrangements for transportation to appointments and securing childcare services during times of treatment . <p> MetroHealth patient navigators can be called upon to help patients in a variety of ways . They can do everything from reminding patients to take their prescriptions to providing even the most basic information , such as where to get their parking validated . In Mary 's case , her patient navigator not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her obtain furniture when she moved . <p> Patient navigation also helps to improve performance outcomes . When a patient misses an appointment , it is detrimental to his or her treatment plan . Additionally , every no-show or cancellation in the cancer specialty area costs money " for MetroHealth , it is nearly $1,500 per appointment . <p> In fact , a six-month Accenture-MetroHealth study shows that the patient navigator program is providing a positive return on investment in a number of ways : <p> Patient navigation support helped reduce no-show and cancellation rates by 3 percent compared to a control group of patients . <p> The revenue generated by the program paid for the salaries of two full-time patient navigators in just over three and a half months . <p> Extrapolating from these results , two full-time navigators across seven high-cost priority areas , such as head and neck cancers , colon cancer and diabetes , could yield approximately $2.1 million per year . <p> In addition to performance improvements , patient navigation can improve health outcomes . This is reflected in data from Dr. Harold Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades ago to improve cancer survival among disadvantaged populations in Harlem . With patient navigation and access to screening , the Harlem Hospital Center saw five-year survival rates in breast cancer increase from 39 percent to 70 percent . <p> These findings showcase the huge impact that patient-navigation support could have if implemented widely , especially in large health systems . For example , Accenture has partnered with Dr. Freeman and the Patient Navigation Institute ( PNI ) since 2009 to drive the capacity and scale of training patient navigators through online curriculum that arms them with the skills to succeed .

Our study found that organizations are using machine-reengineering to establish new forms of human-machine collaboration that break through the bottlenecks of complex digital processes . In some cases , such as interpreting images or writing reports , machine-reengineering directly helps workers perform digital tasks . In other cases , machine-reengineering helps people uncover insights that are buried in a mountain of data . Here are some examples of how companies are using the speed and smarts enabled by machine-reengineered processes . <h> Scanning Images , Voice and Text <p> As companies implement digital strategies , they introduce new labor-intensive tasks to sort through all the data they 're collecting .

@@37681500 @6681500/ <h> Sleep-Deprived People Are More Likely to Cheat <p> Good managers focus not only on bottom-line performance , but on the means by which their people achieve that high performance . Unethical behaviors can be damaging to a broad variety of stakeholders , and are often the cause of organizational crises . Ethical behavior not only keeps consciences clean ; it can boost the reputation and performance of your firm . More than ever , ethics must be a primary management concern . <p> A common opinion is that the way to avoid ethical lapses is to figure out how to hire good people . Good people do good things and bad people do bad things : it 's as simple as that . However , the behavioral ethics literature indicates that this is simply not the case ; like Dr. Jekyll , we all have a Mr. Hyde lurking within . The real question is how often we behave as Dr. Jekyll and how often we behave as Mr. Hyde . <p> The workplace has many temptations that employees must resist , from the petty impulse to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse of lying in a negotiation context , to the criminal act of misreporting financial numbers . Recent research indicates that self-control is a key determinant of whether or not people fall to or resist such temptations . When their ability to exert self-control is high , they can resist . When it is low , they cave . <p> As the Jekyll and Hyde analogy suggests , self-control varies over time within the same person . Physiologically , self-control occurs largely in the pre-frontal cortex region of the human brain , and uses glucose as a fuel . The act of using self-control draws upon this fuel , which exhausts the fuel . Thus , one 's ability to exert self-control can become depleted . And when self-control is depleted , people are more likely to cave to temptations to behave unethically . <p> Recent research indicates that sleep deprivation drains glucose in the prefrontal cortex . In other words , a lack of sleep robs the fuel for self-control from the region of the brain responsible for self-control , whereas sleep restores it . Building from this research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unethical behavior . Across a set of four studies in both laboratory and field contexts , we found that a lack of sleep led to high levels of unethical behavior . Moreover , we found that this was because a lack of sleep depleted self-control , which in turn led to unethical behavior . <p> It is important to underscore about this research that it was small amounts of lost sleep that produced noticeable effects on unethical behavior . For example , in one of the laboratory studies my colleagues and I conducted , there was a difference of only about 22 minutes of sleep between those who cheated and those who did not . In the field studies , naturally occurring variation in sleep ( with most nights ranging from 6.5-8.5 hours of sleep ) was sufficient to predict unethical behavior at work the next day . <p> Other researchers have found that a lack of sleep leads to deviant behavior at work , similarly because of decrements in self-control . They found that similarly small amounts of sleep matter ; those who slept six hours or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who slept more than six hours . Many of the deviant work behaviors they examined , such as falsifying receipts , would also be considered unethical behavior . Thus , their research findings support the idea that sleep is crucial for ethics in the workplace . <p> Unfortunately , employees have many demands on their time that compete with sleep , with sleep too often the activity that loses out . Indeed , almost the 30% of Americans get less than six hours of sleep per night , and sleep levels have been trending downward for decades . <p> This growing health crisis may very well have the side effect of creating an ethics crisis as well . And often , it is the people who are in the most important or most influential jobs in a given firm who are most sleep deprived . Consider that , in contrast to the 30% of Americans in general who get less than six hours of sleep , over 40% of managers sleep less than six hours per night . Thus , people entrusted with the most consequential decisions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles that cut into their sleep , which depletes their self-control and leaves them vulnerable to caving to temptations to behave unethically . <p> How can we address the problem of sleep deficits and the unethical behavior they promote ? Organizations need to give sleep more respect . Executives and managers should keep in mind that the more they push employees to work late , come to the office early , and answer emails and calls at all hours , the more they invite unethical behavior to creep in . Because leaders help to set norms by modeling behaviors , my recommendation is to prioritize sleep in your own life , while encouraging your team to do the same . Do what you can to support employees ' sleep health rather than disrupt it . The better rested we all are , the less likely the Mr. Hyde in any of us will come to define us . <p> Christopher M.

Not just those under attack for ethical lapses , accounting problems , or excessive compensation " retired college presidents are the latest to join corporate executives in the latter category . The trouble I 'm referring to is getting new ideas implemented and brought to scale . The leaders range from entrepreneurs with great ideas but a flaw preventing expansion ( Tesla ? ) to new CEOs with a vision their stakeholders wo n't rally behind that wo n't guarantee results anyway . <p> Much has been made of the distinction between leadership and management . Too many managers , not enough leaders , the critics say . Leadership is uplifting , they imply , while management is boring " just a bunch of rigid bureaucrats spinning red tape , or emphasizing efficiency over effectiveness . But my work with numerous top executives shows that this is a false choice . Great leaders also have managerial inclinations . They are practical as well as visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones to roll up their sleeves for the tasks of execution , but they know what to ask of those who do . These abilities grow with experience . <p> As the world now knows , U.S. President Obama has stumbled in the implementation of his signature health care reform idea , the Affordable Care Act . This time his problem is not politics ; it is management . The President and his aides failed to understand the basics of execution . Some of the same citizens who once supported a new-to-the-Senate outsider with fresh ideas now wonder about why they elected someone with no experience running anything . <p> It would be ironic indeed if a presidency that won because of information technology ( effective digital campaigning ) is laid low because of information technology ( a website that failed to work ) .

Bold strokes are decisions that can be made at the top , implemented pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases , layoffs . Long marches take time and the involvement of many people who must produce new elements and coordinate their actions before the change can be successful . In merger integration , for example , IT systems integration often takes the longest , sometimes years . And despite cautious execution , systems still often break down and must be fixed . Good managers know that switchovers to new systems sometimes require running the old and new in parallel for a while , until all conversions are secure . <p> And that is just IT .

@@37681582 @6681582/ <h> The Olympics and the Paradox of Commercialization <p> Regular as clockwork , every four years there are predictable lamentations in the media concerning the over-commercialization of the Olympics . The complaint has always struck me as paradoxical . <p> Look to any other realm of organized sport as we know it today , and it is clear that without private sector support , it could not exist . Spectators who pay to attend sport events and who are willing to absorb , in the price of goods and services , the investment by the private sector are the sine qua non of organized sport . <p> Governments have neither the resources nor the appetite for such endeavours . Indeed , this was a reality that plagued the first half century of the Games , when host cities sometimes balked at the costs and reneged on their commitments ( as when Rome , selected as the host for the 1908 Games , withdrew on the stated basis that the costs resulting from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius left it with insufficient resources ) , other Games were conducted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded the 1920 Games , largely in recognition of the damage suffered by Belgium at the hands of the Germans ) , and some were downright cancelled ( 1940 and 1944 , when World War II intervened ) . <p> Meanwhile , we know that , in professional and entertainment sports , spectators are happy to accommodate major commercial involvement . Stadia and media are filled with commercial messaging . Players wear patchworks of commercial logos and advertising . Commercial and public-relations machines turn out Brazilian rainforests ' worth of materials linking athletes and teams to commercial enterprises . <p> Considered in this context , the Olympics stand among the least commercial events in the world . No advertising of any sort is permitted within the competition venues . No athlete may wear any clothing or equipment with any commercial identification whatsoever , other than small indications as to the manufacturer of the clothing or equipment . Hence the paradox : the least commercialized sports event in the world is accused of over-commercialization while those most heavily commercialized receive no similar complaints . <p> How do we account for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very differentiation which the Olympics brand has been able to achieve in comparison with other sports events . As aspirational events for the youth of the world , the Games take on a cast of purity that many worry will be stained by commercial relationships , even though they may recognize the necessity for funding them . Indeed , this is a suspicion of which Olympic sponsors themselves are aware . Consumers , they have discovered , respond well to their sponsorship so long as it is clear that they are contributing to the organization of the Games or to the support of the athletes ' training . People are put off by sponsors who simply slap the five Olympic rings on packaging without indicating that the commitment goes beyond a financial transaction . <p> That the Olympic Games are held to a different standard also becomes evident in the inordinate disappointment expressed when something goes wrong . For many , the Games represent the ideal that peace and friendship can be possible on a global scale . If the Olympics can work , then maybe , just maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance attached to them , problems are taken as stinging rebukes by those who dare to hope . And no doubt the same sense informs the very different responses to doping , the use of prohibited performance-enhancing substances and methods . Evidence of rampant drug use in professional sports leagues is overwhelming , and fans have become inured . It appears that , the more that sport serves as mere entertainment , the more it is tolerated . Yet a case of doping at the Olympics is a huge scandal because the Games stand for triumph through fair play . We ca n't imagine the kind of hypocrisy we observe in professional leagues and their spokespersons being given a pass the Olympics . <p> All of this carries over to the wariness people feel about commercialization of the Games . But the fact is that the Olympics seem to have found a workable formula . The host country ( or city ) provides infrastructure which it can use following the Games . And the private sector , through television rights , sponsorships , licensing , and ticket sales , pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrastructure . This allows the Olympic Movement to focus on its proper role : maintaining and enhancing the fundamental elements of sport played in accordance with the rules ; engaging youth in the pursuit of aspirational goals through sport ; fostering international sport ; and ensuring that the goal of participating in the Olympic Games remains the highest objective for any athlete . <p> It all makes for a combined value proposition that is unique and powerful . Is it sustainable ? No doubt the continuing evolution , even revolutions , in communications technology will force changes to the economic model . The value of the related broadcast rights might be diminished . The ability to protect the value of copyright and trademarks might erode . Corporate governance changes could diminish sponsors ' ability to use the occasion of the Games for entertainment and showcase purposes , and thus reduce the value of sponsorship . <p> So the economic model of the Olympic Games will surely evolve . But it has always evolved , and the Games have become the stronger for the change . The Olympic Movement has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and economic shifts as the world has moved from the 19th Century to the Third Millennium . There is nothing to suggest that it will be any less adept when facing the new ones . 
@@37681689 @6681689/ <h> Spain , Scary Statistics , and Why the U.S. Dollar Remains the World 's Reserve Currency <p> The Spanish held some local elections yesterday and the ruling Socialist party took an expected drubbing . The item in the news commentaries that really jumped out at me , though , was the level of Spain 's unemployment . This country , a large European economy , has an unemployment rate of 21.3% and , more disturbingly , a youth unemployment rate above 40% . Two out of every five young workers do not have a job . It 's hardly surprising that the election was marked by large daily protests in Spain 's biggest cities that might mark the beginnings of a movement . <p> On its own , this would be scary . But consider the unemployment rates of the three European economies that the EU and IMF have been bailing out this past year . Ireland 's unemployment is around 14.6% and its youth rate about 29% . Portugal 's rates are 11.1% and 23% respectively , and for Greece , 14.2% and 35.6% . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hard not to conclude that that Spain is much worse off in employment terms than the three supposedly most vulnerable European states . <p> With a GDP of around $1.4 trillion , Spain 's economy is larger than Portugal 's ( $236 billion ) , Ireland 's ( $186 billion ) , and Greece 's ( $342 billion ) combined . The bailout packages , which may not yet be complete ( the EU and IMF are looking into another one for Greece ) amount to around $375 billion . With Spain 's economy looking as sick as it does , it 's not outside the realms of possibility that Spain will need a bailout as well . But how much longer can the EU and IMF keep on providing that kind of money ? <p> If the pressures on these countries continue , the Eurozone could well be faced by a series of debt restructurings of countries with a collective GDP amounting to over $2 trillion . That 's a lot of debt and fairly aggressive haircut for bondholders and other creditors to those countries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Euro currency zone since creditors over the last decade have rather assumed that any Euro currency country would be good for the money . <p> In the wake of a debt restructuring it 's not hard to imagine that the stronger economies " like Germany " might start to question whether it really made sense to share a currency with less fiscally dependable countries and equally those other countries might question whether Germany 's dominant economic needs were the same as theirs . <p> And that brings me to the dollar . There have been mutterings that the dollar 's days as the world 's reserve currency are numbered . Perhaps , but what are the alternatives if the Euro falls apart ? I 'm not sure that even the Chinese , for all their national pride , can claim to have capital markets that can credibly support a reserve currency .

You can spend ten minutes inching forward , or you cut out and take a circuitous route that will add 15 minutes to your drive , but it 'll be 15 minutes in which you 're moving . Which do you you choose ? <p> The logical answer , the rational economist 's answer , is to spend ten minutes inching forward since it will take you less time to get where you 're going . But if you 're like me , you 'd rather spend fifteen minutes actually driving than ten minutes staring at a bumper in front of you . It does n't really make sense that I 'd voluntarily choose to take longer to get where I 'm going , but it 's also proof of what I consider one of my personal failings : a severe lack of patience . <p> Lucky for me , then , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just two years ago , I found myself tapping my foot or tugging at my hair during traffic jams or any of life 's little waiting games . Bank queues . Lines for the bathroom . The wasted minutes at the start of meetings waiting for everyone to arrive . <p> Today , my iPhone ( any smartphone will do ; I happen to own the iPhone ) rescues me from all these micro-delays . A traffic jam becomes time to listen to a podcast . I check Twitter during a bank line-up . I can check Facebook while waiting for the loo and I can do email at the beginning of meetings . <p> Delays that would formerly have driven me into a frenzy pass very happily now . And if you 're looking at measurable outcomes " my willingness to wait for a delayed colleague , the courtesy with which I ( finally ! ) greet the bank teller , the number of hairs left on my head when traffic finally starts moving " then Alex-with-iPhone looks a lot like Alex-with-patience . <p> But it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patience is an internal state . It 's the ability to be present with the thoughts , emotions and anxieties in a vacant moment . It connects us with the inner voice that gets drowned out by the constant background noise of phone calls , e-mail and TV . And it 's important . Being truly patient helps us improve and solve problems . In patient moments , we suddenly see the solution to an engineering problem , or come up with that tag line for an ad campaign . We think about telling the boss what we really think " and find a constructive way to do just that . We may realize that we 've gone off-track and think of ways to get back on track . <p> Some people find this patience through exercise , meditation , church or other spiritual practices . Others " especially those of us attached to our smartphones " do whatever we can to avoid these moments and prevent them from finding us . <p> In fact , far from fostering patience , my now-reflexive reach for the iPhone is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rare occasion when my iPhone runs out of juice ( I 've got a backup battery .

My intolerance for waiting , for quiet , for nothingness is still there and I 'm forced to recognize that my iPhone is n't 16 gigabytes ' worth of patience : it 's 16 GB of distraction . <p> So I thought the phone was good for my personal failing , but now I think that it 's exacerbating it . The serendipitous gaps that used to be part of even the most hectic modern life can now be reduced to near zero .

And to the outside observer , compulsive smart phone users like me may look like the very picture of calm . With screens to fill our every waking moment , our lack of patience wo n't be betrayed by tapping feet or chewed nails . <p> But let 's not kid ourselves : filling your time checking your phone does n't make you more patient on the inside .

Since Michigan is at the epicenter of the Great Recession , there is no shortage of suggestions about what to do differently . The challenge is in what individuals will do to make a positive difference . <p> To me this question has relevance for leaders at every level , especially as we head into a new decade . And so I think it is worth asking , as you look at your job and the people for whom you are responsible , what will do you to make things better for them and for your organization ? <p> What you suggest will depend upon your level of responsibility . A CEO may consider initiatives that transform the way the company does business . A middle manager may come up with process improvements to optimize departmental efficiency . Or , a front line supervisor may offer ideas for improving the way employees work with customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon role and responsibility , there are some things you can do to increase the likelihood that your suggestions are implemented . <p> Be imaginative . Leaders are responsible for encouraging their followers to think big . Fostering aspiration is a leader 's role and so as you consider what you want people to do differently , think in broad terms . The challenge is to encourage employees to think creatively and allow them to implement ideas that merit attention . <p> Be relevant . Consider your company 's mission . Specifically , think about how it delivers value to customers and stakeholders . Ask yourself what you can do to deliver on that mission more effectively . Managers can deliver on relevancy in three ways . First , ensure that everyone knows how their jobs complement the organizational mission . Second , encourage them to find ways to do their jobs more efficiently . And third , recognize them for making positive contributions . <p> Be specific . While it is necessary to think big , it is also necessary to break the big idea into manageable parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the company 's desire to be an employer of choice might consider how the company recruits , how it fills new positions , and how it develops employees once they are hired . Making the aspiration specific is critical . <p> Be actionable . Specificity opens the door for turning aspirations into actions . This is your opportunity to implement the ideas as objectives . Assign people to carry out the ideas . Provide them with resources as well as timelines . Make certain you do not hand off all responsibility . You need to keep engaged in the change process . <p> There is one further consideration . As the leader , you need to hold yourself accountable . It is not enough to suggest how others change ; you must be ready for change yourself . This advice is something I learned from author and executive coach Mark Goulston . Mark , a psychiatrist by training , always asks senior leaders who push for change if they too are ready to change . It 's one thing to ask others to change ; it is another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability will add credibility to your suggestions for improvements this year . People take their cues from those in charge and when followers sense their leaders are willing to make changes , then such changes have a better chance of success . When a leader invests his credibility in his actions , the payoff can be significant . <p> What advice do you have for people seeking to make changes to their organizations in 2010
