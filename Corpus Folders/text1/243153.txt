What 's the fastest way to identify your gaps and weaknesses ? A Network and Application Layer Penetration Test simulates a real-world attack against your network infrastructure and information systems to identify vulnerabilities and risks which may impact the confidentiality , integrity or availability of your data . It 's imperative to conduct a penetration test regularly if your environment is processing and storing sensitive data ( like payment card data or protected health information ) and those same systems have access to the Internet . In fact , if you are subject to HIPAA , penetration testing is likely required in order to demonstrate that PHI data is well-protected . <p> Unlike a vulnerability assessment or automated vulnerability scan , security engineers performing penetration testing actively try to uncover vulnerabilities and then exploit them in order to breach your systems or obtain access to sensitive data .

As a result , your organization can gain full visibility and understanding of how malicious entities may be attacking your systems and to what extent they are at risk . <p> The engagement starts with an agreement between you and ControlScan on the scope of testing to be conducted , including the target environment and the various approaches to be taken . Depending on your needs , penetration testing can be performed from one or both of the following different perspectives : <p> An External Penetration Test adopts the approach of an anonymous attacker somewhere out on the Internet looking to breach your perimeter defenses and gain access to your environment . <p> An Internal Penetration Test shows you the risks posed to your information systems by an insider ( e.g. , an employee or contractor ) or an attacker that has already breached your perimeter . <p> Both types of testing provide insight into your organization 's risk exposure , but from different perspectives . <h> To become secure , expose your vulnerabilities . <p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify services and functions which may be vulnerable , followed by a discovery of vulnerabilities affecting in-scope targets and then finally attempt to exploit those vulnerabilities in order to compromise the exposed systems .

Conducting a PCI IT Risk Assessment is an ideal way to establish a complete picture of your organization 's overall security posture across administrative , physical , and technical safeguards . When conducted regularly ( at least annually ) , an IT Risk Assessment can help to prevent breaches , reduce the impact of a breach if one occurs , and provide a clear roadmap to achieving compliance with PCI-DSS Risk Assessment Guidelines as well as any other relevant data security regulations and mandates . It is especially useful if your organization is subject to multiple compliance standards " such as the combination of PCI and HIPAA-HITECH . <p> The ControlScan PCI IT Risk Assessment process is tailored to your specific organization , environment and circumstances .

During this phase of the process , ControlScan will also conduct a review of your organization 's documented processes and procedures with PCI risk assessment tools . Interviews , sampling and various technical tests are conducted in order to gauge the breadth and scope of IT vulnerabilities and threats . In-place controls , such as network security devices , separation of duties , access controls and password policies are also assessed for adequacy and resiliency at this stage . <p> The final step in our IT Risk Assessment process involves analyzing information on threats and in-place controls to determine composite risk levels of each functional area .

Now what ? <p> At a recent debt collection industry event I was asked numerous times : Do I really need to undergo an SSAE 16 audit ? <p> It 's a common request , especially if you work with financial institutions . However , the short answer to the question is , it depends . <p> All too often , misaligned business and/or compliance objectives drive a requirement from which neither the requester , nor the requested of , receives any actual benefit . In fact , a perception of compliance that does n't actually exist can create additional risk for the organization . The SSAE 16 is a prime example of this . <p> There 's one big question you need to ask prior to pursuing an SSAE 16 ... <h> What are you really being asked to verify and report on ? <p> An SSAE 16 , or SOC 1 as it is formally called , is an audit of internal controls over financial reporting at a service organization . In other words , this- audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As such , the SSAE 16 targets service providers that provide a financial service of some kind . This is particularly appropriate for those who offer debt collection services . <p> For example , if a user organization such as a lender needs third-party assurance that your agency 's financial reporting of its recovery activities is accurate , then the answer to our title question is yes . <h> Is the request for SSAE 16 information security related ? <p> Now if the lender is asking for an SSAE 16 in order to validate your agency 's information security controls , then they are doing so in error . Why ? Because the SSAE 16 is specifically designed NOT to report on information security controls . <p> Herein lies the rub . Virtually every conversation I have had with businesses in the Accounts Receivable Management ( ARM ) industry has revealed that the requested purpose of the SSAE 16 is to validate information security controls . <h> Why audits should be aligned with your risk profile . <p> The sad reality is that lenders and debt buyers regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSAE 16 is meant to replace ! But then they request an SSAE 16 for information security assurance , which it was never meant to provide . In this all-too-common scenario , service providers pay big bucks to receive an audit their user organizations do n't need , while the user organization checks a box for which they have no real assurance . <p> It 's time for service organizations and the user organizations they serve to take a fresh look at their respective assurance vehicles and mutually agree upon which third-party audit reports will actually meet their risk-reduction objectives . <p> For financial reporting , most consider SSAE 16 appropriate . However , nowhere in the legislation is SSAE 16 or any other audit report specifically called out . Rather , it is up to the user organization to determine which third-party audit is appropriate based on the unique risk the service provider poses , given the nature of the services they provide . <h> Now , about information security ... <p> If information security assurance is the actual goal , what are the appropriate third-party audit reports ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audits it 's conducting or undergoing to save valuable time and money ? - The answer is yes !
