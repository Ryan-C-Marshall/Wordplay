@@62704966 @2704966/ <h> Script Notes / Possible Spoilers From Vince McMahon Biopic <p> Note : These notes are from early versions of the screenplay , before Vince McMahon had any involvement and before WWE Studios joined on as partners . The final script will likely be way different and a lot of the " racier " / more controversial parts will probably be cut out , if I had to guess . <p> The script begins in 1970 with Vince , already married to Linda ( who is working as a waitress in a strip club ) , frustrated by his door to door job as a salesman . His frustration is increased when he visits his father ( Vince Sr. , who curses up a storm in every scene as he talks down to his son ) who 's WWWF is playing to half-empty buildings . Vince implores to his father that the audience does n't  care about the wrestling but really wants drama and theatrics . His father does n't  want to hear it and blows his son off , demanding he does n't  get involved in wrestling . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine to be the local promoter and is blown away after witnessing Led Zeppelin live in the building , realizing the lesson of how important lighting , music , flashy characters and audience engagement are to changing the pro wrestling presentation . <p> In a scene at the strip club Linda tells Vince she is pregnant ( with Shane McMahon ) and Vince declares the mother of his child " wont work in a place like this " and they leave . The manager tries to stop Linda from leaving before the end of her shift and ends up in a fist-fight with Vince , who hiptosses and clotheslines him . The script then makes it very , very clear that Linda is turned on by what Vince has done . There is also a line where Linda says that she and Vince could never be the political type but perhaps their kids will be one day . <p> Vince is brought in as an announcer after his father gets WWOR TV and does n't  want to pay his announcer a " national , union " wage , realizing Vince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes an announcer and eventually negotiates a one million dollar buyout of his father , keeping Gorilla Monsoon on as his number two . Monsoon is a big character in the film , being portrayed as what Pat Patterson was in the real-life version of WWE . In an early draft , Monsoon ends up on the stand during Vinces steroid trial , playing the role that Hulk Hogan did in real life , as the former McMahon confidante , now forced into a situation against him . A later draft of the script puts Hogan in that role . <p> A major change from real-life in all the drafts of the script is the idea that Vince Sr. passed away during the McMahon trial . McMahon Sr. passed away before the first Wrestlemania . In the script Vince and his father have a moment where they make amends before his passing , leading directly into a major scene where McMahon , on the stand in his defense , has a big dramatic monologue about how the government should n't be in the business of blue collar people , telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury sympathetic to him before he is cleared of all charges . <p> In a twist , over the course of the trial , Vinces infidelities are exposed , shocking his family . After he is found not guilty , there is a scene where Vince is in a limo with Linda , Stephanie and Shane and they all rail against him for the terrible person he is only for all of them to flip the switch on him and tell him that 's the making of their next great heel . Instead of the Montreal Screwjob the " Mr. McMahon character " in this version of the story was inspired by Vince being exposed for being a terrible person over the course of the trial . During the trial , there is a scene where Shane and Stephanie McMahon , still in High School , are bullied over their fathers legal issues , leading to the siblings beating up their bullies in a school hallway , sending them into lockers using wrestling moves and telling their classmates they should try to " Be A Star " and see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the infamous " Im in the Rassling Business " phone call that Vince McMahon has recounted over the years , but there 's no Eric Bischoff to be found in the script . Instead , in this version , Jim and David Crockett work for Turner and they go after Hogan for their weekly program . <p> The film portrays that Vince found Junkyard Dog as a construction worker , Roddy Piper drunk in a jail cell , Jimmy Snuka as a porn actor and transformed them into pro wrestlers . There is a scene where Vince drives Linda to Montreal for their anniversary and throws a fit in a French restaurant because he hated their food , leading to the owner coming out the owner being Andre the Giant and that all along , the trip was Vinces way of scouting this giant he has heard of . The idea is that Vince then brings Andre into the business and trains him to be a wrestler . There is also a scene of Vince stealing Hogan from the AWA , introducing him to steroids and teaching him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage and Roddy Piper on a plane . There is a scene where Hogan is dealing with steroid use hurting his sex drive and indeed , the size of his genitals . Hogan attempts to film his sexual encounter but ca n't figure out how to use the VHS Camcorder he bought . In a later scene , a female wrestler ( Stacy Kiebler ) propositions Vince backstage , leading to him instead telling Linda ( in front of Kiebler ) what was suggested so instead Linda leads Vince into the stands at MSG to do the deed herself with her husband while fans are distracted by WrestleMania 20 . <p> In the screenplay , Lindas one order to McMahon is that he can do whatever he wants to present his persona and the company to the public lie all he wants but between them there can only be truth . As their success builds , the two marvel that pro wrestling could sell out Madison Square Garden ( which it had for decades but that is not the story the film wants to tell ) and that Wrestlemania brings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sit there slack-jawed in happy shock over how the show did . During the movie Vince gets lost in the success ( and the sex and drugs and rock and roll that comes with it ) is played up while he realizes how badly he s hurt Linda when it all comes out . <p> One version of the script features a scene where Randy Savage and Vince have a conversation about how Savage is popular with young women the same age as Stephanie , leading to Savage telling Vince he would never think of touching her . That is the only time that oft-repeated rumor is mentioned , and you can pretty much guarantee that scene will never see the light of day for all the obvious reasons . <p> Here is an image from the beginning of the screenplay : 199526 @qwx609526 <p> Mike <p> Is this a porno ? <p> Mikey D <p> If this is the script drafted " pre-Vince " , one can only hope the script gets better with his involvement .

However , things may have gotten " too real " recently . <p> Mauro Ranallo recently won the 2016 Wrestling Observer Award for " Best Commentator " and posted a " thank you " message on Instagram : <p> However , there is apparently some sort of " unwritten rule " in wrestling where people are not supposed to mention awards that they won outside of their own promotion , and JBL , who apparently takes dumb things like that extremely seriously , seemed to really take issue with Mauro acknowledging the award . <p> On the WWE Network show " Bring It to the Table " ( the night before the first SmackDown Mauro missed ) , JBL went on a mean-spirited angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop culture non sequiturs and retweeting his fans a lot .

There 's also the possibility that JBL said something to Mauro personally ( via private messages on the internet or via text ) . <p> The next night was the first SmackDown he missed three weeks ago and Mauro has been out since , suffering from depression . <p> As mentioned yesterday , he tweeted out that he felt " stronger " and thanked fans for their support .

That 's supposed to be " fighting " ? <p> But yeah WWE is lost to the internet WWE-worshiping geeks , and is little boring guys and vanilla story-telling . 199528 @qwx609528 <p> WWE is so horribly mis-managed and out of touch it is n't even funny . <p> Well , actually it IS funny to me to be honest . 199528 @qwx609528 <p> Charlotte has been over-exposed. 199528 @qwx609528 <p> Um , its not freakin rocket science , and it does n't  take a genius . <p> Please , in Gods sweet name , explain to me WHAT about Bayley that a teenage girl would POSSIBLY think is cool . <p> And would cause them to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and switch to WWE to watch Mrs. Rocky Dennis ? <p> Dwell on that . 199528 @qwx609528 <p> I 'm not surprised by this . <p> I love this story cuz it validates me , <p> Much to the Universes chagrin . 199528 @qwx609528 <p> Furthermore , in Gods sweet name , <p> please explain to me WHAT about WWE that anyone over the age of TEN would think is cool . <p> Speaking of heels : WWE could make Emma into an uber-heel by having her brag about how other women wrestlers spent over a decade trying to get into WWE , while she just waltzed-in at a much younger age . <p> This would get heel heat because it reflects real life : People get stuck in career ruts and get surpassed by others who never faced stagnation . <p> Real-life example : The temporary worker who busts his carcass for years at jobs that have no seniority , while the fresh-faced kid only recently out of high school gets hired as full-time permanent employee , ends up with less seniority and few privileges than that person who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently a woman who had been hired under an " affirmative action plan , " had been chosen for " intangible reasons , " other than ones work experience and educational credentials . Emma seems like the type of person who would get preferential treatment during the selection process , despite lacking obvious skill . <p> And just like how WWE booked Ellsworth , i.e. as an undeserving winner who holds onto success by becoming a cowardly heel , Bayley can not credibly " hang with " established WWE performers except by a series of deux-ex-machina moments .

@@62705146 @2705146/ <h> Opinion : Paiges Future With WWE <p> As we all know by now , WWE performer Paige has had several photos and videos released of her that were sexual in nature . The videos included Paige ( real name Saraya-Jade Bevis ) having sexual intercourse with current wrestler Xavier Woods ( real name Austin Watson ) and former wrestler Brad Maddox ( real name Tyler Kluttz ) and well as a vibrator ( real name Dill E. Doe ) . It should be noted that both Xavier Woods and Brad Maddox are married , although I am not certain if either were married at the time the sexual acts were filmed . <p> The question on everyones mind for Paige is " What 's next " , in regards to her future . Paige was said to be on turbulent waves within WWE for dating Alberto Del Rio , requesting her release ( which was denied ) , being arrested for an altercation in Las Vegas after the 2016 Money In The Bank event and she has been out of action with a neck injury for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the latter of which includes a semen-drenched NXT Womens Title belt ? <p> I believe no action should be taken against Paige in this matter . What a person does in their own private time is their business . What happened between Paige , Woods and Maddox was between consenting adults . People have sex . Sex happens . So do leaks of tapes but should we punish individuals for having sex when the vast majority of the worlds population is " guilty " of the same nefarious act ? Most definitely not . The only questionable offense was drenching WWE property in semen . <p> Enough time has passed that Paige should not face any recourse in regards to the NXT Womens Title . It might be a wise decision for WWE Human Resources to send out a memo asking all talent to refrain from saturating Title Belts with bodily fluids in the future . We , as wrestling fans , can only imagine what Ric Flair , among countless others , have likely done with Title Belts in the past . <p> Lastly , WWE should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , " Fighting With My Family " . The film is being co-produced by WWE Studios and Seven Bucks Productions , which is owned by The Rock . " Fighting With My Family " is being directed by Stephen Merchant , who recently was seen by many movie-goers in the film " Logan " , where he played Caliban . Any punishment Paige received from the leaked photographs and videos would likely attach a negative stigma to her biopic , which is said to have a happy ending . <p> What are your thoughts on Paiges future ? Share them below in the comments section . 199526 @qwx609526 <p> Mike <p> If you punish her for that then you have to punish rollins ( penis pic ) , xavior woods ( he was in the video as well ) and anybody else that may get leaked here soon ( rumors of more women in wwe soon ) otherwise you open yourself up for a nice lawsuit based soley on a sex tape/nudity grounds . <p> Jono <p> I have to agree with you- the idea that flair did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting but hilarious . Paige is not going anywhere . You can not punish a female for the same thing men have done ( tom Phillips face fuck gate , anyone ? ) . I just hope the male fans who shared those videos are not the ones who always rag on wwe for their booking of women and for them not " respecting " women realize . This got so ridiculous and carried away . Great job Kenton ! <p> Calvin <p> Just let her contract run out so she can go to TNA . You know that bush league promotion would welcome her with open arms ( while she opens her legs ) . <p> You know they would give her their title on her first day due to her being an ex-WWE wrestler , so she can make a new video with it . <p> #LOLTNA <p> Mike <p> She better hurry there before alberto finds another piece of taco to shove his burrito in .

How could you not understand that ? <p> Noneya <p> Lol trust me , that was n't light reflecting . First off , there was no design .

As you can see by the photo , the panel of her dress is about 3-4 inches thick down the entire middle of the back . You can clearly see how it looks with light reflected on and off of it . No woman would continue to sit in a soiled dress &amp; allow cameraman to photograph her in it . <p> Steve Roth <p> Its Stephanie McMahon .

Bruce knows how to make wrestling great , and he certainly knows how to make an Impact . <p> They really played up the " old owners were idiots and ruined TNA " / " Make Impact Wrestling Great Again " angle at the tapings . <p> Bruce Prichard as Brother Love 199526 @qwx609526 199530 @qwx609530 <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand . Its not unprecedented . Capitol Sports = World Wide Wrestling Federation = World Wrestling Federation = World Wrestling Entertainment . 199528 @qwx609528 <p> I would n't say " rehabilitate " . That 's too disrespectful to the company to say.and quite unfair . <p> I have been watching for years and enjoy it more than WWE , as much as WWE is worshipped . <p> I think they have gotten as good of tv numbers as possible you are not gon na get 1 million on POP , but they DID get 1 million on SPIKE . <p> WWE unfortunately because of branding and when it USED to be good and its history is what the country thinks of when thinking pro wrestling . <p> What TNA and ROH get ? No one is gon na get much more . <p> In the days of the net , MMA , alternative methods of entertainment and media ? There is n't room for two wrestling companies to be getting 10 million combined anymore . Those days are over . <p> TNA has taken more abuse than deserved Idiots like you/TheX2C claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million viewers is ridiculous , and short-sighted and an easy way to insult something you do n't  like to begin with . That 's not gon na happen anymore . <p> Wrestling is a dead or dying industry , and WWE was the last one standing and they will always , unfortunately get dominant numbers in the industry .. <p> Thankfully they are dropping though . <p> biz <p> You should n't wish for wwe to fail man if you really like the industry . I may not like all of TNA or the way they have been run but I always hope they would do well cause its best for wrestling . <p> But just like TNA has faults I will be the first to say that WWE has many as well . I hate 3 hour raws and some of the storylines are more ridiculous then Matt Hardy giving his powers to his brother . But what WWE has that TNA has n't  ever is 1 person ultimately running the shots and keeping the company in his direction right or wrong . <p> TNA can gain their footing again if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise them on business decisions on how to make more money . Being on POP gives them the ability to start over with new guys and build people in different ways . My only concern is Alberto getting the title in his first match because although I am a fan of him becoming their big heel , I would of rather him feud with someone other then Lashley right away . Pushing a guy because he is known ( from his time in WWE ) is n't stupid , but it gives the perception that nothing has changed . Reading the tweet from JR of him hinting that he may join TNA might be really big if true . Although he was the voice of the WWE , and some are going to think its another WWE guy coming in , people need to understand that bringing JR on board allows a great match caller to also help out behind the scenes . And JR obviously knows his stuff .

Styles won his match on SmackDown to earn a shot at Wyatt , but later on , Orton said that he would in fact be facing Wyatt at WrestleMania . <p> Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan played up a " we have a lot to discuss " angle on Talking Smack , so well see what happens . <p> For now , the expectation is that Bray Wyatt will be taking on Randy Orton for the WWE title and AJ Styles will be taking on Shane McMahon . WWE has been continuously playing up tension between Styles and McMahon and it seems like a good way for it to " come to a head " would be Shane McMahon " screwing " Styles out of a title shot yet again .

Please note " smart money " tends to come in last minute , so these odds could change before the event . <p> Why would you have a betting line on something where the outcome is determined , and someone can fix a match and then bet the mint on it and win for sure , or some backstage insider can bet and cash in who knows the script ? ? ? <p> So crooked . 199531 @qwx609531 <p> I know in vegas they wont take bets for wrestling .
