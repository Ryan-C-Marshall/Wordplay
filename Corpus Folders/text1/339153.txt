Together with this 11th edition , the entire Radio Trek site has also been redesigned , as you can see here .

Taylor InterviewChristian ( 5:41 pm CST ) I ca n't believe I missed this when it was originally posted , but Michelle Erica Green at AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine has put up an interview with Mary Taylor , editor of the new ' clip show book ' ' Adventures in Time and Space .

Yet because it was put together by a fan , the book reflects a passion for characters and themes popular with many viewers , as opposed to more esoteric elements that have achieved critical attention . You wo n't find chapters on 24th-century feminism or on homoerotic subtext in Kirk/Spock stories , but you will find almost 600 pages of excerpts and annotation , plus a timeline placing all the novels within the Star Trek chronology . <p> Spock Vs .

Some of the things he 'd do would be fire all old writers and get some major sci-fi writers to write for the series , while he also talks about what he would do with the next Trek series . One of the series ideas he actually thinks have merit is the Starfleet Academy series : <p> Starfleet Academy : Not a weak Trek meets Top Gun retread , but instead a clever fusion of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's smart take on teen life , DS9 's ongoing plotlines and TNG 's adventure .

Anyway , lots more interesting thoughts on Trek 's future ( including a truly brilliant idea for a series starring Worf and Alexander ) , can be found in the full article . <p> " Ninety-five percent of the people who run this company are Trekkies , " says Maryann Metz , Starbase-1 vice president .

Dahl at GamePen has written a new review of ' Starfleet Command , ' Interplay 's new real-time strategy which can do no wrong .

This may be , initially , a little difficult to understand . SFC appears to be a very slow-paced RTS game involving dueling spaceships , many of which are unfamiliar to Star Trek fans . None of the beloved characters -- beyond Sulu , in a minor speaking role -- make an appearance . Even the races are a question mark -- who are the Lyrians ? Where 's the Borg ? Why is Qo'nos , the Klingon homeworld , named Klinzhai ? To top it all off , there 's a baroque interface and a learning curve to make flight-simulation fanatics quail . So far , it 's obvious that there 's nothing that screams " SUCCESS ! " here . <p> What SFC has is pedigree . It is heavily based on Star Fleet Battles ( or SFB ) , a boardgame that is in turn based on concepts from Star Trek 's original episodes , the animated series of the early 70 's , and the first two Star Trek movies . SFB itself has been around for about twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular , as well as complex , wargames ever . Dozens of rulebooks , supplements , and scenarios have fleshed-out a universe that diverges significantly from the " official " Star Trek as we know of it today . The " Star Fleet Universe " consists of several major races , and many more minor ones , engaged in a General War for galactic supremacy . Combat in SFB consists of individual starship actions , with each starship having detailed maneuverability , offensive , and defensive systems . <p> In the rest of the review , Dahl talks about the game 's complexity , its Dynaverse story engine , and the slightly disappointing interface .

Although we are still looking for the cure to the common cold , early versions of tricorders now exist . Indeed , even a PADD can now be found on the market . And of course , how can we forget our communicators .... I mean cell phones ? In one episode , Mr. Scott was quoted saying an ion drive was beyond the Federation 's technological expertise .

' Now , the series , which will be produced by Tribune Entertainment , has apparently undergone a name change : <p> Many readers have written in telling me actor Kevin Sorbo ( Hercules : The Legendary Journeys ) has announced ( in a very recent interview ) that he will play the captain in the new series Gene Roddenberry 's Andromeda . This is great news for me , as last week I posted Sorbo was interested in starring in one of three Gene Roddenberry posthumous series currently in development - whose titles were Phoenix Rising , Andromeda , Starship . Specifically , I indicated Sorbo was aiming towards either Phoenix Rising or Andromeda . <p> What many fans may not realize is that the Andromeda show with which Sorbo is now involved is actually Phoenix Rising , a series mentioned in the article linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hewitt Wolfe . That 's right : The Powers That Be have taken the name of one Roddenberry series-in-development and slapped it onto Phoenix Rising - a completely unrelated Roddenberry series-in-development . So , Phoenix Rising is now called Andromeda - and The Series Formerly Known as Andromeda now has no title at all ( for the moment ) . <p> According to AICN , the Gene Roddenberry CGI series ' Starship ' is still called ' Starship , ' while no title is yet known for what used to be ' Andromeda . ' Personally I believe that what used to be ' Andromeda ' simply does n't exist anymore - after all , Tribune originally announced they 'd only be doing two new Roddenberry series . I also wonder why they actually changed the title - personally I thought ' Phoenix Rising ' sounded rather good . Anyways , you can find the original AICN report by going here . <p> UPN Scores AgainChristian ( 10:31 am CST ) UPN 's new season actually seems to be rather successful - not only did their ' The Source Hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ratings last week , on Monday the network also achieved its highest Monday night ratings in over a year . UPN ( the station also showing ' Voyager ' ) managed to pull in so many viewers with the fall season premiere of ' Moesha , ' which achieved a 4.5 rating / 7 share , and a sneak preview of their new series ' Grown Ups , ' which even got a 4.9/8 rating . A full Monday night ratings report can be found here , thanks go out to TV Guide for pointing out UPN 's achievement . <p> Trek Bottled Water Label DesignChristian ( 10:31 am CST ) The Starbase-1 Coffee Company , which has already brought the world Star Trek coffee , tea and chocolates , has announced that its new Star Trek Bottled Water line will be launched in both the United States and Canada within the next 60 days . The beverage , which will be called ' Altair Water , ' will be offered in " a wide range of sizes from 12 ounces to 1.5 liter . " Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will have its own special label , a picture of which can now be found here .

Christian ( 10:31 am CST ) Yesterday was the 29th birthday of Jennifer Lien , who starred on Voyager during its first three seasons as Kes . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 10:30 am CST ) -This evening at 9:00pm , UPN will be repeating the rather great Voyager episode ' Timeless , ' which first aired on the 18th of November , 1998 . Take a look at how the official Continuum describes the episode : <p> Fifteen years after the Starship U.S.S. Voyager crashes into a desolate ice planet , Commander Chakotay and former Ensign Harry Kim , sole survivors of the tragedy , steal the Delta Flyer from a Federation shipyard and return to the U.S.S. Voyager 's frozen hull . Aided by Chakotay 's striking love interest , Lieutenant Tessa Omond , Chakotay and Kim are hotly pursued fugitives with hope that somewhere embedded beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe can change the fate of their long-dead fellow crew members . <p> Thanks go out to the Continuum for both the description and the image , which is of course copyrighted by Paramount Pictures . <p> -At 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing another episode in their ' Kirk 's Women ' theme week , namely ' Elaan of Troyius. ' 163809 @qwx573809 <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:30 am CST ) Incredibly , I 've actually found the time to do another update again , even if I 'm typing this from behind a public internet terminal in the library . Hopefully I should be able to update from home sometime soon again . Meanwhile , I 'd still very much appreciate it if the following people would contact me , as I lost their e-mail address in my hard disk crash : <p> Kathryn Keeter <p> Bradley Hastings <p> Dee <p> ' Atavachron ' <p> Steven Y. Petersen <p> Though I do think I 'll be able to do another update tomorrow , I 'm not 100% certain - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection at home up and running . <p> Monday August 23 , 1999 <p> Autograph Cards With German VideoChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) Our German partner site TrekZone.de is reporting that CIC Germany will be including a autograph card of Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) with every copy of ' Dark Frontier , ' or , as the Germans like to call it , ' Das ungewisse Dunkel . ' Apparently , buying the video will be the only possibly way for Germans to actually see the Voyager TV movie , as it has been banned from being on shown on German television for the near future . In this way , CIC will be able to make a large profit out of ' Dark Frontier ' - the video should sell extremely well , considering CIC will be spending close to DM 300.000 ( $150.000 ) on television spots and magazine ads . <p> New Starfleet Command ReviewChristian ( 3:01 pm CST ) The Antagonist Games Network ( who comes up with these names anyway ? ) has put up a review of Interplay 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 85% . Refreshingly , though , reviewer Johnny Law finds several nits which only a hardcore Trek fan would be able to find : <p> While the Starfleet Command 's graphics do n't do for Star Trek what X-Wing Alliance does for Star Wars , it comes reasonably close . The ships are pretty detailed at close range , but unfortunately , those details also reveal technical flaws . <p> For example , even though my ship might be called the U.S.S. Monitor ( NCC-5005 ) , zooming in unfortunately reveals an entirely different name and fleet callsign . Other little " cracks " rear their ugly heads too , including the fact that phasers do n't fire from the correct spot on a Light Cruiser ( think Reliant ) . While the " average " person might overlook these sorts of things , Trekkers are hardly average people . They 'll be all over this like Denebian Slime Devils on an Altarian mucous vent . <p> The full review can be found here . Thanks go out , as usual , to Federation HQ for this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocket Books editor John Ordover just updated his Q&amp;A board with several more answers to questions about his Star Trek novels . In one of his answers , he even provides a lot of info on several upcoming Trek books : <p> Query from : Antoine Okay . General questions now instead of the praises . FIRST , what is the GENERAL Synopsis of Peter David 's next NF books ? What will next year 's Series be , I heard something about a parallel universe thing going . Who from the Parllel universe will we see ? Maybe a return of Kira for that one was really left open . What other big things do we have to look foward to next year in Trek books ? And I know I asked you this before but is I , Q some sort of sequal to Q- Squared ? And what 's up with this Voyager and DS9 triology next year with the addition of Section 31 ? I 'm just asking so I can start getting into them now ! Thanks <p> Response from : John Ordover I 'm having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . The next NF books involve Si Cwan finally finding his sister and Calhoun finding his long-lost son . There is a two book series coming late 2000/2001 called DARK PASSIONS set in DS9 's mirror universe and starring the Intendant , Mirror-Deanna , Mirror-Annika Hansen , but that 's not next year 's crossover . You have lots of big things to look forward to. : ) I , Q is not a sequel to Q- Squared . The DS9 Milennium trilogy is Margaret 's . The Voyager trilogy is called DARK MATTERS and is by Christie Golden , and deals with minor matters like the end of the Universe . Not sure what you mean about the addition of S31 . <p> UPN Scores Highest Friday RatingChristian ( 3:00 pm CST ) TV Guide is reporting that UPN scored its highest-ever Friday night rating with its broadcast of ' The Source Hip Hop Music Awards . ' The show scored a 4.2 rating / 8 share , which not only gave the network its best-ever Friday ratings , but also the highest on any night since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , apparently . The full report on this can be found on TV Guide 's news page . <p> From the opening movie to my first battle , I knew this was going to be a lot of fun . The game features three modes of play : Campaign , Skirmish , and network/Internet play . With 6 empires from the Star Trek universe to play with - Federation , Klingon , Romulan , Gorn , Hydran , and Lyran , as well as the Orion Pirates tossed in for good measure - the game has a lot of things for the player to do . <p> The full review can be found here . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the link . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 2:59 pm CST ) -At 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing what many consider to be the Original Series ' best episode , ' The City On The Edge Of Forever . ' This is part of a special " Kirk 's Women " theme week on the Sci-Fi Channel . 163809 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads and more at the actual Trek BBS ! <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 2:58 pm CST ) Do you know what the worst feeling in the universe is ? The dawning realisation that together with the crash which wiped out your copy of Windows ' 98 , you also lost the past two years of e-mails ! For all that time , I treasured my mails , and could , if I wanted to , even re-read the very first e-mail I had ever sent . Unfortunately , since yesterday morning , all that is gone , and I can tell you - it sucks . <p> Unfortunately , what that also means is that I 've irretrievably lost the e-mail addresses of several people , the last two weeks of mailbag mails ( yes , I hate that too ) , several comics Q&amp;A questions , and of course also several e-mails I had n't answered yet . Therefore , could the following people please contact me as soon as possible : <p> Kathryn Keeter <p> Dee <p> ' Atavachron ' <p> Heather Jarman <p> Tamara Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list and did sometimes exchange e-mail with me , and are not on my ICQ contact list , please do also send me mail . <p> In other news which may surprise , tomorrow might be the first day in six months without a TrekToday update , as I myself am moving . Thanks to my new laptop ( which I actually mainly bought for situations such as this ) I do hope I 'll still be able to do a mini-update , but I 'm sure you 'll understand if I give precedence to getting my stuff unpacked instead : - ) <p> Sunday August 22 , 1999 <p> Interplay Open New ' New Worlds ' SiteChristian ( 3:34 pm CST ) David Tan just mailed me to let me know that Interplay have apparently opened a new version of their ' Star Trek : New World ' web site . In addition to the screenhots of the game they were already offering , they 've also released a 24.8 MB movie of the game - the same one which is also included with Interplay 's new ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out oon . You can find the new web site here . <p> When Mystery , Alaska 's amateur hockey team accepts a challenge to play against the New York Rangers , the entire population must put their petty differences aside and pull together as their small town becomes the center of a nationally televised event . <p> A preview of the film is now apparently being shown before the new film ' Mystery Men . ' Thanks go out to Eston Melton for this . <p> German Voyager Air ScheduleChristian ( 3:34 pm CST ) Besides the DS9 schedule which they already posted a few weeks ago , the German Star Trek Index has now also posted the official Sat.1 schedule for Voyager . The schedule shows all Voyager episodes which will be shown from the 28th of August until the 18th of September - five in total , as Sat.1 will stop broadcasting two Voyager episodes every Saturday when DS9 's 7th season starts . You can find the full German schedule here . <p> Brent Spiner Done On ' Gepetto'Christian ( 3:34 pm CST ) Welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data ) has finished work on the Disney made-for-tv musical ' Gepetto , ' in which he plays the evil puppeteer Stromboli . Presumably this means that RenT Auberjonois ( Odo ) and Scarlett Pomers ( Naomi Wildman ) , who also have a small part in the film , have finished filming as well . <p> ' Star Trek : New Worlds ' EditorialChristian ( 3:33 pm CST ) Steve Erhardt at Evil Avatar has posted a mini-editorial about ' New Worlds , ' the upcoming real-time strategy game by Interplay . Though Erhardt thinks Interplay 's ' Starfleet Command ' and ' Klingon Academy ' look pretty cool , he also believes ' New Worlds ' will prove to be a masive disappointment : <p> New Worlds is gon na flop , and it 's not necessarily because of a bad game design ( More like uninspired . ) . I think the most recent ads for the game explain it real well if you read between the lines : " We 've added the ultimate feature to real-time strategy ... Star Trek . " <p> Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games have we seen get flushed down the toilet because the best thing they had to offer was the Star Trek name , rather than good gameplay ? Adding a Star Trek veneer to an RTS game is no guarantee it 's gon na be good . In fact , with a GROUND-BASED RTS , you 've practically just shot yourself in the foot . <p> The full editorial , which I myself tend to agree with , can be found here . <p> Domain Broker Registers ' Flight Academy'Christian ( 3:32 pm CST ) Jut over a month ago , on the 12th of July , domain name company Keith Malley registered a domain which will surely interest a lot of you - **25;67;TOOLONG . According to the site 's For Sale list , this domain can actually be bought as part of a package including seven other domains such as TheGodfather4.com and TeachingMrsTingle.com , for the total price of $2,479.51 . The company is already describing ' Flight Academy ' as the ' next Star Trek series , ' even though nothing at all has been officially announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Trek series start popping up , other domain name brokers will be quick to register domain related to them . <p> Oh , and in case you were wondering , FlightAcademy.com belongs to a Dallas-based flight school , while FlightAcademy.net has also already been registered . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:32 pm CST ) Fate must be holding a grudge against me . Though most of you will not have realised it , today is actually a special day for TrekToday , as the site was officially opened precisely six months ago ! Naturally , that is cause for celebration , especially considering I have n't missed even one day of updating in that time , but , unfortunately , my computer chose precisely today to break down on me . In the middle of receiving my mail this morning , it suddenly went dead , and when it started up again , many crucial system files were actually corrupted . Fortunately , I still had my brand new laptop , but unfortunately no software has been installed on that yet - plus the extra external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which only seems to work after repeated slamming on it . <p> The results of this are that : <p> I have n't been able to answer any e-mail yet , nor will I be able to until I 've either managed to get my desktop PC running again or until I 've gotten around to setting up e-mail on my laptop . <p> Today 's TrekToday update will be dramatically shortened , and not at all what you would expect from an update on this milestone day . <p> Today 's update will presumably miss several ' s 's , due to that bloody external keyboard . <p> Furthermore , the Maniac is also reproting that the official Star Trek Fan Club now has their exclusive ' Captain Kirk as a Romulan ' ( from ' The Enterprise Incident ' ) available for order at the official Star Trek Store . More information on this figure ( and the reason for its rather high $69 price ) can be found at the Toy Maniac 's Trek news page . <p> New James Darren ArticleChristian ( 3:43 pm CST ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the new James Darren CD ' This One 's From The Heart . ' The article contains the rathr interesting news that Darren originally did n't even want to be on Deep Space Nine : <p> James Darren thought when he turned down the initial offer to play a Las Vegas-style lounge singer in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine that that would be the end of that . A 60s heartthrob as Moondoggie in Gidget movies and a contemporary of The Rat Pack , Darren had quietly stopped singing some 12 years ago when he started directing television . <p> " I did n't want to play a singer , " says Darren of his agent 's first call regarding Star Trek . " I 'd fallen into directing when I was doing T.J. Hooker and I loved not having to shave . But the Trek producers had called my agent back and asked if I would do a courtesy read of the script . Once I read ' His Way , ' it was me on the phone saying I wanted to meet these guys ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own musical career has even been relaunched thanks to Trek , as is also mentioned in the full Continuum article , together with a touching description of the final ' What You Leave Behind ' scene , a mention of the producers ' enthusiasms for Vic Fontaine , and info on the actual recording of the CD . Click here to read it . <p> Federation HQ Starfleet Command ReviewChristian ( 3:41 pm CST ) Trek gaming site Federation HQ has put up a new in-depth review of ' Starfleet Command , ' Interplay 's new real-time strategy game . Not surprisingly considering all the praise this game has already received , the Federation HQ reviewer rather liked the game : <p> Starfleet Command is not yet another space shooter , but a real-time tactical simulation that portrays starship combat in the Star Trek Universe based on a twenty year old board game called Starfleet Battles with rulebooks the size of your average telephone book . <p> Interplay 's translation of the board game is admirably well done . They 've basically eliminated the necessity of having to familiarize yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and made the game accessible to the casual gamer , yet retained the depth which one would expect of a good war game . <p> More On Braga Leaving RumoursChristian ( 3:41 pm CST ) Steve Krutzler at TrekWeb has posted the following update on yesterday 's story which mentioned that Voyager 's executive producer Brannon Braga would be leaving the show mid-season to work on Series V : <p> TrekWeb has been in contact with an additional source who says that Brannon Braga is planning to leave AFTER the end of the sixth season to work on the new series , not at midseason as reported by another source . It is for the final season of Voyager that Ken Biller would take over as Executive Producer . <p> As is also mentioned in the full TrekWeb report , please remember that none of this is official yet . <p> New Book On Trek 's ComputersChristian ( 3:41 pm CST ) Robert Weinberg , co-author of upcoming ' The Computers of Star Trek ' book , just sent in the following news announcement about his new unauthorized Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basic Books will be publishing THE COMPUTERS OF STAR TREK by Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg . While there have been numerous books published on the physics , the biology , the metaphysics , and the philosophy of STAR TREK , there 's never been a book solely devoted to the one subject that binds all the universe of Trek together - the computers . Our book covers in depth such topics as Data , Artificial Intelligence , the ship 's computer system , the Borg , the Holodeck , space war , and many other computer related topics . We compare today 's computer systems with those three hundred years from now and come up with some pretty astonishing ( and fun ) results . <p> ... <p> While the book is due out in November from Basic Books ( in hardcover , at $22.00 - you can pre-order it now from Amazon.com at 30% off ! ) , Lois and I are extremely anxious to publicize our book now so it does n't get lost among the many huge Christmas book promotions . Thus , Lois has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book that was deleted because of space limitations . There are over 4,000 words of non-fiction about our favorite computer-oriented episodes of STAR TREK and why we picked them . This is material that wo n't be found in the book , only on the Net . <p> As is mentioned in the above news submission , you can find this additional chapter by going here . <p> Star Trek Pizzas Are FreeChristian ( 3:40 pm CST ) As was already reported a few weeks ago , this weekend a Star Trek TNG marathon will be held in San Francisco by the KBHK television station , which will be accompanied by the first-ever experiment in ordering pizzas using your remote control . Now , the San Jose Mercury has a new article about this which mentions that all pizzas ordered during the marathon will actually be free : <p> This weekend , some Bay Area Star Trek ' ' fans will boldly go where no one has gone before , at least not from a recliner . During a Star Trek : The Next Generation ' ' marathon on KBHK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus set-top box will see interactive commercials for Domino 's that enable them to order pizzas via remote control . No need to budge -- they 'll just punch a few keys and a pizza will materialize at their doorstep . <p> Better yet , the pizzas are free . But that 's just because the event is a promotion for B3TV , the San Francisco-based start-up providing the technology that bridges the gap between science fiction and real-time pizza delivery . <p> The full article , which was written by Jon Healey , goes into a bit more detail about the pizza-ordering system , which will actually only be usable for WebTV users . You can find it all here . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:39 pm CST ) -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Sacrifice of Angels ' at 16:00 BST , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Initiations , ' according to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:39 pm CST ) I now know it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is staffed by people who are either dishonest or simply incompetent , and I 've got the statistical evidence to prove it . In total , I 've bought six computers in my life . Quite literally none of those actually worked when we actually arrived home with it . We 've had a computer store sell us a faulty monitor , another one deciding not to install Windows after still charging a standard $50 installation fee , and another one which forgot to plug in the processor ( I kid you not ) . <p> Last week , I bought a new laptop , and yesterday the store called to tell me it had arrived . Remembering my previous experiences with computer equipment , I asked them if I could see the laptop running and everything functioning in the store . I am so happy I did that , as , needless to say , everything did not function . The modem did n't function ( ' Oops , had n't tested that yet ' ) , the external mouse refused to immediately work , and all of Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took them no less than 3 hours to actually get everything working - why did n't they bother to actually test their equipment before they sold it to me ? Of course , if I 'd made the mistake of not asking to see it running before I took it home with me , I 'd probably have spent the entire weekend trying to make it work , and then later needing to fight with them to actually fix it - with two previous computers , I was actually accused of being the one who broke the computer . <p> Fortunately , everything is now working ( and the laptop is still pretty cool , running at no less than 366 lovely Megahertz and having a 13.3 " screen ) , but I do n't think I 'll ever be able to trust anyone who sells computers anymore . <p> ( BTW , before all the mails start pouring in again , yes , I 'm sure you are actually a salesman who does know something about computers : - ) <p> Friday August 20 , 1999 <p> New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TrekWeb has posted several new reports on Trek 's future which range from the very interesting to the truly bizarre . The first one deals with another staff change for ' Voyager , ' one which is not that surprising considering the upcoming new series : <p> " Here 's the deal : Biller left because he was steamed at Moore coming in above him . Moore gets forced out , Biller 's wooed back in with the promise that he 'll be show-runner when Braga moves over to series five . Multiple sources say the handoff happens at mid- season , which tracks well with how long it takes to get a series off the ground by fall 2000 . " <p> As TrekWeb also stresses , this is still just a rumour , but it 's certainly more than interesting . After that , TrekWeb has two more news items , one of which is yet another confirmation of the ' Flight Academy ' concept , which certainly seems to be looking more and more real . The last rumour is certainly very surprising , and deals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining Voyager ! This does n't really sound like something which would actually happen , but you can still read about it in the full TrekWeb update . Meanwhile , what are your thoughts on all this ? Please send them in to feedback@treknation.com so we can use them in this weekend 's mailbag ! <p> Eon Reviews TOS DVDsChristian ( 1:53 pm CST ) Jeff Bond at Eon Magazine has put up a review of the first two Original Series DVDs , which were released by Paramount just a few days ago . As most reviewers , Bond thinks the DVDs have been done pretty well : <p> For Trekkers who 've been slowly wearing out their overpriced Classic TREK videos , the DVDs are a dream come true , finally putting the episodes in mint , remastered form on a medium that wo n't wear out ( we think , anyway ) . And two episodes per disc might seem generous at $19.95 a pop ( $11.00 at amazon.com ) when you have to pay $12-$15 for one on video . But that still means we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... at which time Paramount will probably start rolling out STAR TREK : THE SPECIAL EDITION DVDs . <p> The full review , in which Bond awards the episode an A- , can be found here . <p> Brent Spiner Con TranscriptChristian ( 1:53 pm CST ) Welcome , Brent Spiner Fans ! has posted a transcript of the recent appearance by Brent Spiner ( Data ) at the Creation convention in San Francisco , on the 7th of August . The transcript is incredibly long , and has Spiner talking about being famous , his new TV movie ' Introducing Dorothy Dandridge , ' his role on TNG and , of course , Star Trek X : <p> Someone in the Audience : Is that true that the next Star Trek X will be the last one for you and Next Generation ? <p> Brent Spiner : Well , that 's an interesting question . He 's asking if Star Trek X will be the last movie that our group does . You know what ? To be completely honest with you , I 'm not even sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard anything about it . It 's not like , they call me ( BS : chuckling ) , they do n't call me and say , ah , we 're gon na be doing this in two years , and we really want you to do it . It really comes at the last second , they have this script and they say , ok , we 're going to do this , do you want to be in it ? Ah , so I have no idea if were even going to be in the next one . Hum , probably are , but we 're all happy to do one more . We 'd like to . A really good ( weird ? ) one . <p> SA : ( something about ST X being the movie where DS9 crew would take over the franchise ) <p> BS:That DS9 is going to be handed over to ? If the next one is the last one ? I seriously doubt that ( laughter ) but , I do n't know . Maybe . I think we could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from everything . I do n't know if they can afford that ( laugthter ) . But , you know we could do it , like ... It could be a desert motif , ( laughter ) ah , ( BS : chuckling ) the whole movie takes place in the desert and so , you know , they save a lot of money because they do n't have to build any sets ( laughter ) , and then . But I do n't know what 's going to happen . I really do n't . I hope we 're in one more . <p> SA : nothing lasts forever ... <p> BS : Yeah , exactly . Nothing lasts forever . But you know , I still feel that we have ... That if they ask us to do another one , we 're thrilled because we really want to do one more . But , if they do n't , we will have done something like 186 hours of Star Trek , and nobody got cheated , really . So , ah , it 'd be great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , that 's fine too . Yes , sir ... <p> The full transcript ( which , as I said , is HUGE and could easily take you a long time to read ) can be found here . <p> Oohlala 's earpiece . Here we finally explain what that contraption that hangs of Oohlala 's ear really is . <p> You can submit your punchlines here . Presumably you get bonus points if you also include a reason for Oohlala sitting on the wrong side of the bridge : - ) . <p> Lolita Fatjo Talks VoyagerChristian ( 1:52 pm CST ) Karen Bennett , newsletter editor of the Canadian Trek fan club U.S.S. Hudson Bay , just sent me a transcript of a speech Paramount 's Lolita Fatjo gave at the Toronto Trek convention in July . As the Hudson Bay is currently having troubles with its web site , they have n't yet been able to put it up at their web site , but fortunately you 'll be able to already find some of Fatjo 's most newsworthy answers from the con here below : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what projects the former DS9 writers are working on ? <p> A : Ira has another year of a development deal at Paramount , so I think he 's working on some pilots and some features . Right now , Ron Moore is taking a long-overdue vacation . RenT Echevarria went to New York to help run a new show called Now and Again or Now and Then , something like that it 's called Once and Again , and will run on ABC-Ed. , that was created by the people who did Moonlighting . Hans Beimler is working on The Profiler . <p> Q : There 's a rumour floating around the Internet that says that Paramount wants to make Harry Kim and Tom Paris more available , and that they 're going to break up Tom and B'Elanna . Is there any truth to this ? <p> A : That 's a total Internet rumour . Tom and Harry more available for each other ? No , Tom and B'Elanna are very much together right now . In the episode we 're doing right now , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge Torres episode . We learn a lot about her background , and Tom is right there with her . That 's just one of those things that people start on the Internet who have ' way too much time on their hands . <p> Q : I 'm glad you mentioned that you still have an open-script policy , because at a panel I attended yesterday , somebody said that because of some legal problems , Star Trek was n't doing this any more . <p> A : Who is that ?

At 17:00 , they 'll be showing Voyager 's ' The 37s . ' <p> Michael Iversen at the Universe has posted a rather large amount of spoilers for Voyager 's sixth season . The first one deals with the B'Elanna Torres episode ' Barge of the Dead , ' which is apparently undergoing reshoots : <p> Barge of the dead has been pushed back because it is not very good , and they are doing a ton of reshoots and recuts . This episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bryan Fuller . ( Fuller wrote the script ) RDM left Voyager 's production team a month ago without an official reason . <p> My source later added : Like I said , Barge of the dead has been pushed back , and no one has anything good to say about it so far . The script seemed pretty lame , and I guess the real thing is n't going much better . <p> The reshoot thing at least seems to be valid - only two days ago , internet spoiler provider Dangermouse posted a message to Usenet stating that ' Barge of the Dead ' is getting some reshoots , and has been pushed back to a few episodes later in the season . <p> Besides the ' Barge of the Dead ' info , the Universe also has new info on ' Survival Instinct , ' ' Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy ' and ' Alice , ' which will all probably air as part of the first five episodes or so .

The artists involved had full access to all of the sets and production drawings from the film . With the exception of reproducing various areas of the Enterprise E , they used these set drawings as launching points for the areas you 'll explore during the game . Hidden Evil will show new areas of the Ba'ku village , the aforementioned alien cities , Romulan facilities , and even areas of the Enterprise that were implied , but not shown , in the movie . <p> Find more on the game in the full preview , written by Allen Rausch .

I was invited to the big premiere of Insurrection and I got to go on the private plane they used to take people to Las Vegas . I did see him on the plane , but he was busy talking to Majel Roddenberry . I thought , ' Oh , I do n't want to disturb him . I 'll talk to him later . ' But after the movie , he got whisked right back to New York , because he was doing a play on Broadway . I was like , ' Ugh ! I totally missed him . ' I was so upset .

Thanks in advance ! <p> Tim Russ InterviewChristian ( 4:35 pm CST ) The new edition of Visual Imagination 's TV Zone includes an interview with Tim Russ , better known as Tuvok on ' Star Trek : Voyager . ' As usual , TV Zone has put up a short preview of the full interview , in which he talks about the effects of Seven of Nine joining the crew : <p> " The network generated a tremendous amount of promotion surrounding Seven 's coming onto the show , " explains Russ . " Subsequently , the writers were pressured to write stories favouring the character so that Seven was prominent in several episodes during the past two seasons . <p> " If there was any increase in viewership because of all this publicity then obviously that 's positive for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of forgot about the rest of the characters , including the captain . What they ended up doing a lot of times was pairing Janeway with Seven to make sure she was involved in the story . So for a while the ensemble element of the series suffered .

And , although I had what I 'm told is the standard " developer 's rash " of tiny things I should have caught at the last minute , it 's pretty much a beautiful , beautiful book -- it looks like Paramount Pictures hired Matt Jeffries to design an RPG book in 1968 -- and a more than serviceable game . <p> More info on the game ( which is actually completely new , not just a sourcebook for the TNG game ) , can be found in the full column . <p> ' Trek Monthly ' DeBoer InterviewChristian ( 4:25 pm CST ) NikkiDeBoer.com has put up an interview with Nicole deBoer ( Ezri Dax ) which first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monthly ' magazine .

It was a little bit daunting . I was nervous because I really wanted to do a good job and I hoped that the fans would like me because Jadzia had been a very well-loved character . It was kind of hard , but you do n't think about that once you 're on set with the director and your fellow actors actually working on scenes . Then it just becomes about the work . Everybody on the show was great and there are so many good actors there that made the jump a lot easier .

Carrying a Japanese-built instrument , NASA 's largest balloon -- 39 million cubic feet in volume -- lifted off from Lynn Lake , Manitoba , Canada , at 9:22 a.m . EDT Aug. 11 for a 38-hour flight more than 20 miles above Earth . The 5,000-pound instrument was recovered Aug. 12 and will be prepared for another flight next year . The BESS project ( Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Solenoidal magnet ) , led by Prof. Shuji Orito of the University of Tokyo , is sponsored in the U.S. by NASA and by Monbusho in Japan . <p> Antiparticles are rare forms of matter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister " particles . For example , a proton has a positive charge and an electron has a negative charge . An antiproton , though , has a negative charge and an antielectron has a positive charge . Scientists study antimatter to understand structure and energy processes in the Universe . <p> Besides this , antimatter can also be found in the engine rooms of all Starfleet vessels , as the ships are powered by combining matter and antimatter , releasing enourmous amounts of energy . Obviously , this is nowhere near reality , but it certainly is interesting to see these possible first steps towards it . According to NASA , they were able to collect several hundred anti-protons , which should give their scientists some extra study material . A complete report on their mission , plus some extra info on why this search for antimatter is so important for physicists , can be found in the full press release . <p> Frakes Stars In ' The Lot'Christian ( 4:14 pm CST ) A new article by David L. Beck of Knight Ridder Newspapers talks about a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' channel today , called ' The Lot . ' One of the stars is of the series is apparently Jonathan Frakes , best-known for his role as Commander Riker on the Next Generation . Take a look at what the role of Frakes is in the series : <p> The former No. 2 Guy on " Star Trek The Next Generation " has traded in his space jammies for a white suit and a black mustache on AMC 's " The Lot , " a satiric melodrama about Hollywood circa 1937 . Or maybe it 's a melodramatic satire ; AMC 's intentions are a little hard to divine . <p> Frakes plays Roland White , a rich sleazeball aircraft-maker who is dabbling in movies and in starlets but who is not , for purposes of this series , named Howard Hughes . It 's a key role , because White is always hovering around the fringes until he swoops in and scoops up all of the toys , but it 's hard to know if he 's supposed to be sinister or clownish . Frakes is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately I could n't find the original article on any official newspaper site , but fortunately ' Shawnster ' re-posted a copy of the article to the Coffee Nebula discussion board .

Christian ( 4:13 pm CST ) You may be wondering where this week 's " The Franchise 's Future " article is - unfortunately , I 'm wondering the same thing myself . Hopefully I should get this week 's installment very soon indeed , after which it 'll immediately go up . <p> Link of the Day : Take a look at the far-left top side of this week 's edition of The Onion , the satirical fake news site , for a small Trek reference . Thanks go out to Anarchos at the TrekWeb Message Board for this . <p> Recently , brief technical data has been released for the often seen Akira Class . For those who are not aware , this ship looks like a Galaxy Class vessel tossed into a trash compactor . Information about this vessel is routine , detailing crew size and the maximum available speed . However , I was stunned to learn this vessel has more weapons than any other ship before it , including the Defiant Class . Total , this vessel has over fifteen photon torpedo launchers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are a peace oriented group create such a weapon ? Is this an image of the dark side of the Star Trek force ? <p> Rick Berman was quoted saying , " Our goal with Deep Space Nine is to help portray the dark side of this universe . We want to bring it down to earth . " Looking at the legacy the show left behind , I have to say they were successful in their goal . Furthermore , as I have mentioned in previous weeks , they proceeded to turn Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets into a corrupt organization . The introduction of Section 31 , the military takeover of Earth , and the creation of such destructive ships as the Akira were successful in removing the innocence we had seen in the Original Series , Next Generation , and even to a point on Voyager . <p> In the rest of his column , Fred further examines this dark side , and wonders if the Dominion War had more far-lasting effects than any of us would like to think . You can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More information I received from Chris Taylor moments ago : ) The final " non-beta " version of the patch is approaching release ! Depending on internal testing , we could see the final version by the end of this week . Chris mentioned that a lot of fixes will be included , and that he 'll be posting a list of bugs that the team are aware of and working on , soon ! <p> The second report deals with the UK version of the game , which will apparently have the beta patch fixes built in already ! The UK and European version is handled by Virgin Interactive , but no final release date has been set yet . More info on the game 's patch status , plus almost anything else SFC-related , can be found at the Starfleet Universe ! <p> AICN Roddenbery Series ReportChristian ( 3:58 pm CST ) Glen Oliver has put up a new report dealing with the upcoming Tribune Entertainment series ' based on ' Gene Roddenberry concepts . The first report deals with Robert Hewitt Wolfe 's ' Phoenix Rising ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept for the show - Wolfe originally pitched it as a show set in the Star Trek universe : <p> FLASH BACK : Remember Roddenberry 's two series pilots from the ' 70s ( Genesis II and Planet Earth ) ? Both featured a man called Dylan Hunt being frozen in ( more or less ) modern day , then revived on an Earth that has fallen to great savagery and barbarism . The point of the proposed series would have been for Hunt and his sidekicks to work towards reuniting and re-unifying mankind . Remember this . <p> PRESENT DAY : Robert Hewitt Wolfe conceives of his " perfect " Star Trek series : a series set thousands of years in Star Trek 's future . The galaxy is in turmoil , all of the governments to which Trek fans are accustomed have crumbled and imploded . The galaxy is a really screwed up place : Vulcans have renounced their logic and are now savage enemies of anyone who crosses them . Homeless Klingons roam space in violent packs of attack ships . The Federation is long gone - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this untamed reality . <p> AICN then goes on to provide some more info on what could have been , had the series actually been accepted as the new Trek series , and provides us with some extrapolations on what ' Phoenix Rising ' might be . After that , the site reports on ' Starship , ' a CGI show dealing with a team of ' galactic troubleshooters . ' Lastly , the report deals with ' Andromeda , ' which is apparently a concept which was also toyed with . The full report about this can be found here . When you read it , do remember that Robert Hewitt Wolfe recently already confirmed that ' Phoenix Rising ' is actually in production , and that this will be the series featuring Kevin Sorbo ( from Hercules ) . <p> As with any science fiction show , the fans of Deep Space Nine are never shy about letting their opinions be heard . In particular , fans on the Internet have had a lot of venues with which to register their pleasure and displeasure with the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose reviews of Star Trek became the standard against which all other reviews were measured . But everywhere online , one could find discussions of the show , with fans weighing in on which episodes were the best and which were the worst . And , for finding a list of the most favorite and least favorite episodes , there was one poll that stood out . <p> The " Spoiler-Free Opinion " Summary , or SOS , is run by Joe Reiss at http : **30;94;TOOLONG , and it covers all of the Star Trek series . Reiss started the survey in the fall of 1992 via postings to the Star Trek newsgroups on the Internet , and he later developed it into a Web page . The SOS is probably the most comprehensive survey of the fans . About 3,000 different people have rated episodes on the SOS Web page from all the Star Trek series . Over the run of DS9 , an average of over 400 fans per episode have registered their ratings . <p> In the full article , SFE provides a list of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments on each episode .

This week , one of the questions deals with the Deep Space Nine stars , and what they will be doing now that DS9 is over . IGN Sci-Fi 's answer does n't really provide any new info , but it does sum up nicely what all the actors will be doing now : <p> Several of DS9 's regulars , including Brooks and Rene Auberjonois are planning on returning to the distant planetary system from which they came -- the theater . A few ( Nicole DeBoer , Alexander Siddig , Colm Meaney , Michael Dorn ) have movie projects in the pipeline . On the TV front , Cirroc Lofton can be seen on a new Showtime TV program called The Hoop Life , about a fictitious basketball team called the LA Legends . <p> Auberjonois will be featured in a Disney musical TV movie Gepetto ( with fellow Trek lifeform Brent Spiner ) , Terry Farrell stars opposite Ted Danson in the CBS sitcom Becker , and Armin Shimerman was last seen getting munched by a giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet announced her next project .

In his comprehensive review , Steve Tannehill says he rather likes the DVDs , even though they are a bit expensive : <p> Paramount is clearly packaging these discs with maximum profits in mind . Although a dual-layered ( DVD-9 ) disc could easily hold three episodes and probably four , we are only getting two episodes on a single-layered ( DVD-5 ) disc . The cost is US$20 a disc ( retail , with pre-order discounts taking the price down to the $12 range ) . I am not as much concerned about the price-per-episode ratio . I 'll pay $6 a show . My biggest concern is shelf space . Would n't it be great to get a double-sided , dual-layered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc ? Instead of taking up the shelf space for forty discs , it could be ten . And yes , I am sure these " super " discs would cost the same as separate two-episode discs . But frankly , part of the cost of the DVD is also in the two feet of shelf space required to store it . To take a favorite line from a classic movie , we 're going to need a bigger boat . <p> The first two discs in the Star Trek franchise street on Tuesday , August 17 . The next four discs are coming to DVD in the Fall of 1999 . The remaining discs are said to be coming in the new millennium . I 'll take that to mean the year 2000 ( does no one understand what " millennium " means ? ) I like Star Trek and I am glad to see the original series make it to DVD after I ignored the opportunity to buy the series on tape or laserdisc . I just wish that there had been an optional mono mix , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set . <p> The first disc in the set contains " Where No Man Has Gone Before " and " The Corbomite Maneuver , " while the second set contains " Mudd 's Women " and " The Enemy Within .

The Raving Toy Maniac has put up a new edition of Mara 's Corner , the monthly column where a Playmates employee answers fan question about their Trek action figures . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : Why has Playmates always produced Next Generation 5-inch figures that are supposed to have BLUE uniforms as GREEN instead ? For example : Tapestry II Picard and Deanna Troi in Duty Uniform . <p> A : Pantone color specs are called out and approved by Viacom consumer products . When given , these are the guidelines for product . Looking at real wardrobe , or photos or filmed episodes ( under various lights ) really gets confusing as to what a " real " color is . Many times they are vastly different than what you would " perceive " as the " right " color . It 's a subjective interpretation , and the final decision belongs to the licensor . <p> Q : Will there be Star Trek toys from Playmates in 2000 ? <p> A : Very likely , but exactly what kind , how or where - is still being discussed between Viacom and Playmates . <p> Two CCG Tournament WinnersChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) Now that this ComiCon , held this weekend in San Diego is over , Decipher has posted two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first report deals with the Invitation Tournament , which was apparently one of the most challenging tournaments held over the past few months : <p> San Diego Comic Con 's Star Trek CCG Invitational was the smallest championship qualifying event run so far , but it was arguably the most challenging . The field of 18 players who gathered on Friday , August 13 included seven who had competed in past Trek World Championships . <p> Two games into the tournament , just how difficult the remaining games would be was realized when not one player had succeeded in scoring full 2-point wins in their games . Halfway through the event , several players were heard to say , " this is harder than the Worlds ! " <p> In the end , this tournament was won by Chris De Jong , who already took part in the World Finals in 1998 , as you can read in the full Invitational Tournament Report . The second report deals with the team tournament held at the convention , which was won by the Borg team , on which De Jong also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team tournament here . <p> Visit The X-Men SetChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) UGO , the wonderful group of people who also help keep this site alive by providing the banners at the top of this page , just launched a rather great iniative - the X-Men Movie Sweepstakes !

According to the reviewer , this might well be considered the best Trek game ever : <p> Based loosely on the incredibly deep cult-favorite Starfleet Battles tabletop game , Starfleet Command models ship-to-ship combat Star Trek-style . The ships are huge , slow moving , and powerful ; combat is a delicate and complicated mix of energy management , tactics , and real-time strategy . And everything comes together seamlessly to provide not only the best Star Trek game ever , but probably the best naval simulation I 've ever played . <p> Starfleet Battles fans will be pleased to see many of their favorite rules and tactics implemented so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are balanced well here . Sure , it is n't a direct translation , but the development teams are obviously fans of the work . <p> You can find the full review by following this link . Thanks go out , as usual when there is Starfleet Command news to report , to the Starfleet Universe for this . <p> This article has spoilers for the seventh and final season ( and possibly seasons before ) of " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " . Proceed at your own risk . Hi there . One last time ... here we are . This review 's been more of an effort than usual to write--I 'm not sure whether it 's because it 's the last one , or whether that means it 's a good thing this is the last one . ( Possibly a bit of both . ) <p> Anyway , if you 've been reading my stuff for a year or two ( or ten ) , by now you know the drill . First , there 's an episode-by-episode recap , where I see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season 's end over the course of a little over a week , then there 's general commentary on trends , successes , and failures of the entire season .

Take a look at two of the most interesting questions he answered : <p> Query from : David I was a little let down when i looked at aventures in time and space tonight . I was hoping it was a guide book to the novels . like episode guide . a compendium if you will . anyways i think that would a dream come to to trek book fans . have you ever considered that ? <p> Response from : John Ordover The timeline in AITS is about as close as we 're going to get to that kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer Michael Bright 's question . Why does Shatner get away with writing novels that are so far off of the established Star Trek Universe ? There 's no question that they are event novels and as such will sell well , but Bright 's points were all very valid . If I sent in the novel " Dark Victory " today , without having Shatner already having written it , it would be rejecte <p> Response from : John Ordover Do you really have to ask why -William Shatner- gets to do things in Star Trek that others do n't get to do ? : ) <p> I have gotten a videoclip from Fed Con 7 , it 's of Robert Duncan McNeill singing " Its a Story ... " . It 's a special videoclip you can get nowhere else .

Christian ( 3:06 pm CST ) Unfortunately , it appears my e-mail problem still has n't been fully fixed - this morning , it was down again for at least four hours . If this is n't fixed very soon , I 'll be looking for a new web host , but , in the meantime , please try to resend your mails a few hours later if they were bounced back to you . Alternatively , if that does n't work either , please send your mail to trektoday@hotmail.com , which is a temporary address I set up for this purpose . <p> Would you like to wish Robert Picardo a very special " Happy Birthday " this year ? His birthday is October 27 . Every year the members of CARPE , the " Central Alliance of Robert Picardo Enthusiasts , " and other fans of Bob Picardo commemorate his birthday with cards and notes . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packet every year !

This is a wonderful charity , doing great work raising money for pediatric AIDS research . For more information on the Foundation , go to their web site at http : //www.pedaids.org . <p> If you want to participate , you should send birthday cards ( preferably in unsealed envelopes , placed inside a second mailing envelope ) AND/OR donation checks , made out to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation , to CARPE 's mailing address , which can be found on their web site . <p> Update , Sunday , 9:53 CET : CARPE 's President just sent out another mail , saying that you should only use the e-mail address to send in electronic greeting cards of the type offered by many Internet card companies , not to send in simple e-mail .

In the end , " Insurrection " finished 8th among the Trek films domestically , 3rd in overseas reciepts , and 5th overall . Insurrection will go down as the median Trek film -- falling right in the middle . As far as video and DVD goes , those numbers will always be in flux . As Insurrection left the top ten , it had earned 9.69 million dollars , but has easily surpassed 10 million by now . That will be the number I 'll keep for reference . DVD rentals and sales figures are not posted in any public forum that I 've been able to find , so we 'll have to do without . The video should be out for sale now or will be soon , and that data is sometimes available , so I 'll post as it comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The official William Shatner Connection is reporting that William Shatner ( James T.

On the show , the away teams were usually walking arround in very narrow hallways , with tubes and tentacles hanging everywhere . Are you also planning to feature this sort of environment ? <p> Chris Foster : We have reasons for them being more open at that point . They are story oriented reasons that I ca n't reveal right now , but in adition - we have to make allowances for gameplay . For the game to be playable and very fun in all areas , we are forced to widen certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas on the Borg levels that are cramped , as in the shows : including hanging tubes ... <p> TrekToday : I was reading the German PC Action article about the game , which mentioned that the in-game music would react to what was happening in the game , just like in the actual television series . What sort of music will you actually be using ? <p> Chris Foster : Most of the music will be created in a Trek vein by our in-studio musicians . We will be using sounds from the series as well . <p> Thanks go out to Chris Foster for answering my questions - he certainly helped save TrekToday from a day with almost no other ' real ' news : - ) . <p> Vidiot Voyager Cast BiographiesChristian ( 3:22 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has put up the official cast photos for all five seasons of ' Star Trek : Voyager , ' showing both group photos and individual photos of all the stars , plus detailed biographies of all the actors and producer Rick Berman .

Christian ( 3:21 pm CST ) Has anyone else noticed this Continuum news item about the new Starfleet Command game ' going gold before debuting in stores ' ? It certainly had me rolling over the floor - presumably the reporter mis-interpreted the computer industry term ' going gold ' ( indicating that a game is finished and will now be transported to stores ) for the sales term ' going gold ' ( indicating that a certain amount of copies has been sold ) . If this is indeed what happened , the Continuum 's report seems akin to excitedly reporting that an episode has finished filming before it was actually broadcast : - ) . <p> Friday August 13 , 1999 <p> New MailbagChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) Actually the mailbag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to announce it anywhere on the site : - ( .

Remember , keep on sending your thoughts on all things Trek to feedback@treknation.com so we can actually put them in our mailbag ! <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' StatusChristian ( 3:24 pm CST ) A few minutes ago , Raven 's Chris Foster , Lead Designer for ' Voyager : Elite Force , ' updated his . plan with some info on how the game is progressing : <p> Things on the design end of Elite Force are going well .

The full report can be found here , while a schedule of the Decipher happenings at ComiCon can be found here . <p> New ' Birth of the Federation ' ReviewChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) The game 's been out for about two months now , but a new review of Microprose 's turn-based strategy game ' Birth of the Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review was written by Steve Bilodeau , who liked the game , but did n't think it was a classic : <p> Only a Star Trek fan will think this is a great game , and some of those fans might not think so either . Though there have been valiant efforts at consistency with the show , the computer 's intelligence strays from what it should do to keep in character . My Romulan Empire was growing along , doing nothing to provoke my supposedly peace-loving Federation neighbour when suddenly the troop transports start invading my worlds . This is not only inconsistent with the shows , but it is also inconsistent with the description in the manual . <p> And that manual is woefully inadequate , given how complex the game is . In order to learn enough about the game to write this review , I had to fork out another $30 for the Strategy Guide . This is unacceptable . <p> All in all , Birth of the Federation gets a thumbs-up for being challenging and engaging . Star Trek fans will be rewarded for struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy gamer will find the defects and the skimpy manual too significant to overlook . <p> Personally I do believe the game is ' great , ' but then I 've always been a fan of hard-core strategy games . Bilodeau 's full review can be found here . <p> Nimoy Calls For More DramaChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) A report from AP talks about a recent plea from Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) and John deLancie ( Q ) , who called for more drama classes in California 's public schools : <p> You do n't need sets , costumes , or lighting , you do n't need a lot of money , ' ' Nimoy , who starred as the pointy-eared Mr. Spock , said Thursday . You just need interested students and teachers to make drama work in California 's schools . ' ' State law now requires students to take a year of arts or a foreign language . School districts can have higher requirements , but only about half now require one year each of art and foreign language . <p> Nimoy and actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Next Generation , ' ' suggested schools could bring drama classes back by acting out ' ' school subjects in short plays . <p> Nimoy and deLancie have been working together on the Alien Voices production company , which creates dramatizations of classic sci-fi works , for three years now . More on this can be found in the full article . <p> Six New ' Armada ' ScreenshotsChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) Strategy Gaming Online has posted no less than six new screenshots of the upcoming Activision real-time strategy game ' Armada . ' They all look extremely great , showing ships such as the Prometheus-class starship , several Romulan vessels , and even something which looks like a Borg ship . The screenshots can be found here . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the link . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:14 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective ( which is still down , I 'm getting this via ODN , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Empok Nor ' at 16:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be showing Voyager 's ' Elogium .

Major thanks go out to Robert Wolfe for confirming this to us ! <p> In related news , ' Dr. No ' tells me that one of the main plot points of ' Phoenix Rising ' will apparently be that the ship Sorbo is commanding is sentient , which certainly allows for a lot of interesting possibilities . Note that this plot tidbit certainly has n't been officially confirmed yet - treat it as you would any other rumour . <p> Lastly , Cinescape is reporting that Sony has bought Robert Wolfe 's sci-fi thriller screenplay ' Zero G. ' The film will be produced by Terrence Chang and John Woo , and will be set on an international space station . <p> Starfleet Command ReviewsChristian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new real-time strategy game ' Starfleet Command ' have started popping up on the net . Computer Games Online have already posted their ' Quick Take , ' a prelude to the real review . Their first impressions certainly seem to be positive : <p> Starfleet Command may change the Trek game curse . A brief examination reveals a game that offers an excellent premise , depth of gameplay , and striking visuals , all in one package . " Brief examination " is perhaps a bit of a misnomerthe sheer scale and complexity of the game makes it difficult to even superficially evaluate the game without spending , say , a week in utter seclusion with a computer and a steady supply of Twizzlers and Jolt . The manual is a slick and well written 164-page spiral-bound monster ( written by Senior Designer Chris Taylor , who was also responsible for the excellent Fallout manual ) , and the game itself boasts a learning curve steep enough to make the manual required reading before you get started . <p> The full Quick Take , as written by Benjamin E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More in-depth is the IGN PC review , which was written by Trent C. Ward . Awarding the game an 8.3 , he praises the game 's longevity : <p> In the end , Starfleet Command offers up one of the most innovative looks at the RTS game that I 've seen in a really long time . Just about every strategy fan who has the patience to learn all the controls ( and you have to read the manual here folks , the tutorials leave quite a bit of important stuff out ) will be happy with the purchase of this game . With that said , I did have quite a few stability issues with this title ( it kicked me out to Windows about a dozen times before I stopped counting ) and it 's frighteningly hard to learn if you 're not patient . With those caveats in place , I highly recommend this title to everyone . <p> IGN 's full review , which is almost as huge as the game 's manual , can be found here . Thanks go out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterly newsletter they announce that a series of " Stamps Of The Century " Christmas ornaments based on the ongoing postage stamp series will be released . One of these will be the Star Trek stamp . These ornaments are described as featuring " etched metal frames with ceramic stamp designs " . As they are pictured in my newsletter , each ornament has a pressed metal frame with the ceramic stamp suspended inside . <p> The artwork on the Star Trek stamp ( which is the same as will appear on the forthcoming Trek stamp and is a painted image of the original Enterprise by artist Keith Birdsong ) is very impressive . Each ornament will list for $9.95 and will join previously announced Trek 1999 ornaments Lt. Commander Worf($14.95) , USS Rio Grande runabout ( lighted and " talking " $24.00 ) , and USS Enterprise " Crown Reflections " ( $25.00 ) . <p> Info on the other ornaments based on the staps can be found in the full report . <p> I am now currently working on re-implementing our NPC 's and enemies into the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just incredible . It 's amazing to see the super high quality models and skins our artists come up with in this new lighting- to see one of our NPC 's nose cast a shadow on his face is just , well , cool as hell . <p> The shadowing and lighting really helps round out our models a lot . Seven of Nine looked great before ( because we have excellent modellers and animators and our skin artists are magicians when it comes to making skin textures that round off the model ) , but now she has even more depth and her curves and shadows look almost eerily lifelike to me ( there are issues with some shadow lines being too sharp , but we have a couple ideas about that ) . The new externalization of data ideas we 're starting to implement seem like they 'll work well and save us a lot of hassle . <p> More info on the game 's artificial intelligence system can be found in the full update . <p> New Comics Q&amp;AChristian ( 4:00 pm CST ) Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doubly hampered by my e-mail problems : first when people sent in questions , and then when Jeff sent back his answers . In any case , we 've now finally got a new edition of the Comics Q&amp;A , where Wildstorm editor Jeff Mariotte answers your every question about the Star Trek comics . Take a look at two of the most interesting questions : <p> Query From : Captain Jim This is n't a question , but an answer . Roy Gales wrote to you wanting to obtain a copy of the " Ashes of Eden " comic book adaption . This book is available at Amazon.com . <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte As the owner of a specialty science fiction/mystery/horror bookstore , it 's against my principles to recommend Amazon for anything . I 'm sure , if it 's available there , it 's also available at various comic book stores around -- but at least , it 's available . Happy hunting ! <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte It 's been my contention all along that , considering the limited number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , most fans would get more enjoyment from seeing new stories rather than old stories re-told in a different medium . So we 're focusing on that -- creating exciting new Star Trek stories that help expand on the dynamic universe of Star Trek . <p> More questions and answers can be found at the Q&amp;A Board , where you 'll also be able to ask questions yourself ! <p> It was one of the few times I ever worked with a star who was also a director -- with Jonathan Frakes . It 's sort of a strange thing . You 're sitting with the person you 're working with and you 're seeing him on the screen at the same time . The last RAMBO , Stallone was in charge of post-production , and I spotted the picture with him . He was fine . He 's a good filmmaker actually . <p> STAR TREK is such an international phenomenon now . In a recent concert I gave in Aberdeen , 40 people came in full STAR TREK regalia . In Budapest , the fan club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote off the foreign on it , but now it 's growing and growing all over . <p> More on his huge career can be found in the full interview . Thanks go out to Adam Bailey for this ! <p> Just a quick note to update you on how the shipping of pre-orders is going etc .. Some people have received their copies of Starfleet Command however I did get one email yesterday from someone who said that the comapny they pre-ordered from ran out of stock so some pre-orders are on " back order " right now . No details on which company however : <p> I also got news that Interplay has run out of Bonus CD 's so if you ordered direct from Interplay do n't be surprised to find no Bonus CD , it 'll be forwarded to you when they get another shipment in . <p> More news of this will undoubtedly be made available at the Starfleet Universe as it gets out .

An hour earlier , ' Seven Days ' managed to get a 2.5 rating / 4 share . As usual , UPN came in sixth among the big networks . On Monday and Tuesday , UPN shows which got higher ratings than Voyager included ' Moesha ' and ' Clueless . ' The full Wednesday report can be found here at UltimateTV . <p> Happy Birthday !

Christian ( 3:57 pm CST ) For some reason , the ' alt-tab ' key combination stopped working while I was compiling news for today 's update - I 've never experienced a more annoying thing . Every time I 'd try to switch between my site list , a specific site and my list of news , I 'd try to alt-tab , only to notice that it did n't work . I certainly hope this is only a temporary thing - I do n't think I could live with a PC without alt-tab ... <p> Wednesday August 11 , 1999 <p> WWF Wrestler News ConfirmedChristian ( 4:32 pm CST ) Unfortunately , the ' wrestlers on Voyager ' rumour does appear to be true . After this week 's edition of a WWF newsletter called the Ross Report first mentioned it , it was also mentioned in an online news show at the WWF web site , presented by a guy named Lucas . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager news : <p> Let 's move on to the rumours ... we 've got a good question Bradley Hastings : " Are the Big Boss Manna and other WWF superstars going to appear on ' Star Trek : Voyager ' in the near future ? " Well , Bradley , I was talking with the Boss Man last week , we had a couple of days off , and he told me that , you know , he recently got a letter from the producers of the show to appear on it . And he is a huge fan of ' Star Trek : Voyager , ' and he told me he 's psyched about the project . <p> But the cool thing is , Boss Man is also going to help us out with this auction we 're doing online . ... Boss Man told me he is going to sign this letter and let you bid on it . So you can actually own the letter from the Star Trek Voyager producers to the Big Boss Man , you know . Anyway , yes , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original report can still be found by clicking this link , which should open RealPlayer and run the show - the Voyager comments can be heard after approximately two minutes . This does absolutely confirm that the producers are planning to feature wrestlers on the show - I know many people went into understandable denial over this , but this latest report makes the news look even more real . Very major thanks go out to Jose Gonzalez for pointing me to this . <p> The final rating for Drone is in , and it did a lot better than I first thought . Star Trek : Voyager was nr. 104 and got a 1.9 . ... Other UPN ratings are " Malcolm and Eddie " and " UPN special presents " with a 1.8 , " Clueless " and " The Sentinel " with a 1.7 , " Moesha " and " 7 Days " with a 1.6 and a second " 7 Days with a 1.5 . <p> More GenCon CCG ReportsChristian ( 4:19 pm CST ) Decipher , the official publisher of the Star Trek Customizable Card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent GenCon convention .

Take a look at three of the most interesting ones : <p> Query from : eight of nine I know there is an intended novelization of Voy season 5-6 cliffhanger/premier . How far in advance do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming did n't begin until June . Will you have another book for whatever EVENT comes to the screen on sweeps week ? Will there be anything significant in these books that is not on the screen ? <p> Response from : John Ordover We like to think we flesh out the stories in the novelizations at least to the extent of giving the interior thoughts and feelings of the chracters . We work from scripts , not from the filmed episodes . There 's nothing planned for sweeps week at this point . <p> Query from : Thunderbyte Is there a planned number of NF books that you are going to write or is it going to be ongoing ? Also , what is " Preserver " going to be about ? Thanks ( sorry to ask so many questions ) : - ) <p> Response from : John Ordover Preserver will pick up the storyline from Dark Victory . NF is ongoing . <p> Query from : Rick Is there any truth to the rumor that a novelization of ELITE FORCE is in the works ? <p> Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IGN Sci-Fi has put up an interview with Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) , who directed the last two TNG movies . In the interview , he talks about his experiences filming ' Insurrection , ' his new movie ' Total Recall 2000 ' and his new series ' Roswell , ' and he even reveals some of his other plans for the future : <p> Frakes also filled us in on his other projects. : " We just sold a film to Sony called ' Steve Was Here , which is a black comedy , " he says . " It also happens to have an alien . It was written by Norman Steinberg , the man who wrote My Favorite Year . And we had a UPN movie called Dying to Live which did very well . We produced that for my company and we 're hoping to turn it into a series . So things are good . " <p> He also plans to collaborate professionally with wife Genie Francis of General Hospital fame . " We are working on two projects , " Frakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hoping she can act in if she could bring herself from General Hospital , and we actually talked about some other projects that we might develop together . So we will be working together . " <p> As for Frakes himself , currently you can catch him in a starring role in the new AMC series The Lot . " I love television , " insists Frakes . " I 'm glad to be back in it . " <p> Voyager Top-Rated UPN Show AgainChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) According to a report by Reuters , ' Star Trek : Voyager ' finally returned as UPN 's top-rated show last week with a repeat of ' Drone , ' even though it had to share that position with ' Between Brothers .

Kirk ) found his wife dead in the swimming pool of their home . According to a report by CNN , she was the victim of an apparent drowning that authorities said they were treating as an accident : <p> Nerine Kidd , 40 , was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics .

" <p> When paramedics arrived at the scene about 10:30 p.m. , Kidd was lying by the side of the pool . Shatner told fire officials that the last time he saw his wife alive was early Monday morning . Foul play apparently did not play a role in her death , Bercovici said . " She was home alone for a short period of time and accidentally drowned while swimming , " he said . <p> Kidd and Shatner had been married since November 1997 . The official William Shatner fan club has put up a special memorial page which includes info on where to send condolences to . We at TrekToday would also like to extend our condolences to the family and friends of Ms Kidd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , another recent question this somewhat reminds me of is , " How much impact will the Y2K computer crisis have on us ? " It 's impossible to know for certain ; we can make our own educated guesses , but in most ways it relies upon the actions of others , outside our own control . <p> But just as I can be reasonably sure we wo n't see society grind to a halt come January 1 , 2000 ( as a result of Y2K or otherwise ) , I can also be reasonably sure that Trek does have a future--both in the long term and the short . <p> Blaze Of Glory Pre-Release EventChristian ( 4:20 pm CST ) An article by Evan Lorentz on the Decipher web site talks about the tremendous interest in their new Blaze of Glory expansion pack for the Star Trek Customizable Card Game . The game was shown this weekend at the GenCon gaming convention , during a special pre-release tournament , and apparently many fans showed up for the event : <p> 100 - yes , that 's 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion . Sadly , due to a limited quantity of expansion packs and an even more limited tournament space , we had to turn several players away from what would have been the game 's largest tournament of all time . <p> ... <p> People seemed unanimously enthusiastic about Blaze of Glory . As the tournament ran , the Decipher booth upstairs was jammed from open to close with people looking for demos of the game from Ambassadors Kate DeStephen , Neil Kirby , and Mick Reese . Some were returning to the game after periods of waning interest . Others were picking it up for the first time . All were eager to explore the possibilities offered by the new cards . <p> A full report of the tournament ( which was won by Dan Allman can be found here . <p> Brooks Punches AgainChristian ( 4:20 pm CST ) What 's it with Avery Brooks ( Benjamin Sisko ) ?

" In the first take , Avery pushed Kelsey hard , " a witness on the set tells the New York Daily News . " The second take was even worse . He ripped Kelsey 's blazer . " By the third take Grammer was fed up . " When Avery went to shove him , Kelsey practically picked him up . His adrenaline was pumping . It was like a boxing match .

The newsletter may not yet have reached you , but here is what you will be able to expect from it : <p> We have the official word about the new Star Trek PlayStation game , which looks like it 'll be quite a blast ( not that I 'll ever know , as I have n't owned a console game system since my Coleco ) . And Star Trek : Starfleet Command ( not to be confused with Starfleet Command : An International Role-Playing Organization -- ODN 's publisher , which has been getting tons of misdirected mail in the past couple months ) has gone gold , and should be in stores next week .

Which time period of the Star Trek timeline does it take place in ? <p> Dan Kingdom : Interplay currently holds the license for the original series of Star Trek , as well as the first six movies .

PhilharmonicChristian ( 4:10 pm CST ) Variety 's Jon Burlingame has written a report about a recent special concert of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , which was conducted by none other than Jerry Goldsmith , the composer of the famous TNG theme . It had apparently been a long-time wish of Goldsmith to conduct an orchestra in his hometown , and now he finally got his chance in a two-night stand at the Hollywood Bowl . Apparently the concert even featured a few Star Trek pieces : <p> Goldsmith , who turned 70 in February , finally got his wish , conducting the L.A. Phil in a two-night stand at the Hollywood Bowl . The 2-1/2-hour program showcased two dozen of his themes for movies and TV from the past 40 years , mixing scores for celebrated films ( Chinatown , ' ' Patton ' ' ) with memorable music from nearly forgotten ones ( The Wind and the Lion ' ' ) and recent commercial hits ( The Mummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Star Trek ' ' franchise via scores for four of the movies and themes for two of the TV series , even had a Klingon deliver his baton at the top of the show . ( Later on , more costumed characters appeared : Disney 's Mickey Mouse and Mulan led the audience in a surprise Happy Birthday ' ' singalong to the maestro . ) <p> The Philharmonic shone on Goldsmith 's more lyrical compositions such as the love themes from Chinatown ' ' and The Russia House , ' ' but demonstrated a decided lack of energy in the more aggressive material , notably the opening Star Trek ' ' music . Highlights were two long medleys of classic themes that , for families present , bridged the generations ( the 1960s ' Sand Pebbles ' ' with the 1980s ' Basic Instinct ' ' in the film medley ; Dr. Kildare ' ' with Star Trek : Voyager ' ' in the TV medley ) . <p> Wired Trek Convention ReportsChristian ( 4:10 pm CST ) Lindsey Are n't  at Wired has written not one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place last Saturday . The report seems to be almost exactly like any other mainstream con report - first it describes all the merchandise on sale , then it includes a few quotes from Trek actors who attended the convention ( in this case Grace Lee Whitney and Brent Spiner ) , and then it gives us a few paragraphs about some of the more exotic Trek fans ( including Klingons and an Orion Slave Girl ) . Grace Lee Whitney ( Yeoman Janice Rand ) apparently rather enjoyed this particular con : <p> While she does not get paid to show up , Whitney gets a free booth on the convention floor where she can sell autographs for US$10 apiece , along with photographs and other merchandise . All told , Whitney said she usually clears about $3,000 per convention . <p> It 's not just the money , she said . " I love the contact with the fans , being able to speak about my role in Star Trek , and my whole life , " she said . " You get to a certain age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very fortunate to be able to have a career spanning 35 years with Star Trek . " <p> Playstation Game Not ' Red Squad'Christian ( 4:10 pm CST ) Contrary to what was recently reported in a GameFan article , Activision 's Star Trek game for the Playstation will not be called ' Red Squad . ' According to Activision 's Laird Malamed , that was only " an internal title that was probably reported from our European press event . The game is still officially unnamed . It wo n't be Red Squad . " <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' InterviewChristian ( 4:09 pm CST ) Lowtax at PlanetQuake has put up an interview with Jake Simpson , one of the programmers behind Raven 's upcoming ' Voyager : Elite Force ' shooter . This interview was conducted at the QuakeCon tournament , which took place this past weekend . Take a look at why Simpson thinks Voyager will break the supposed ' bad Trek game ' curse : <p> Lowtax : " When you showed off Voyager , the levels looked incredibly detailed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days that will amaze you the first 15 minutes or so , but become incredibly tedious and boring after a while . How are you making sure Voyager does n't fall into this category ? " <p> Simpson : " Yeah , you start seeing the same textures over and over again . You see the same scientists over and over again , like in Half Life . I 'm not dissing Half Life , Half Life is an excellent , excellent product , but they ran up against the walls of their day , the multiple characters , stuff like that . They did what they did , and still managed to make a great game . We 're lucky ; we have Quake 3 , we 're a year on in technology . I think the combination of all the great things in this game ; the engine , models , scripting , effects , all of this coupled with the fact that it 's based off Star Trek : Voyager will make this an incredibly fascinating game . " <p> In the full interview , Simpson talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 : Arena ' engine , and about Paramount 's participation in the game design process . Perhaps more interesting than the interview , though , is a report of a ' Voyager : Elite Force ' workshop Simpson gave while at QuakeCon , during which he talked about the new characters created especially for the game : <p> The Voyager game introduces a new team of people to the universe ( this was first discussed and then finally cleared with Paramount . Jake even mentioned that there may be a book , and there 's a vague possibility of an actual episode , that features this team ) . You 're the leader of this team , who 're basically kept around in case of emergency . You 're a group of top special agents trained in a variety of skills , ranging from gunning down Borg to infiltrating enemy ships . Jake was quick to mention that while you 'll be wandering around in a team , you do n't have to control them personally . The AI is excellent , and will react automatically to most situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of game you want , or you can ignore them and let them do their thing if you 're just into blasting the badguys . <p> A *lot* more info on the actual game ( which I 'm beginning to really look forward to , btw ) can be found in the full report . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the interview link . <p> -Miraculously , the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective has been resurrected , which means that I 'll be able to provide UK episode info again for at least the next two weeks .

Christian ( 4:44 pm CST ) What is it with the news over the past few days ? First SFX Magazine reports we 'll be getting more Seven of Nine next year , then the WWF reports we may be seeing wrestlers on Voyager , and now this news item seems intent on giving us all a heart attack . Over the past day or so , two separate sources posted reports about the new Star Trek series , which might well be ' Starfleet Academy . ' First , Derek Wry , former webmaster of the Vulcan CafT , posted the following to the TrekWeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact going to be a " Starfleet Academy " show ( only it will be called something different ) and will begin next season for a one year overlap with Voyager . <p> A few hours after this post , Dangermouse , well-known internet spoiler provider , posted the following to the alt.tv.star-trek.voyager newsgroup : <p> I find this difficult to believe , considering the number of times Rick Berman has said " no it will never happen " , but according to the memos floating around there will be an Academy series running alongside Voyager season 7 ( though it wo n't be called Starfleet Academy ) ... <p> However , given the amount of deliberate , leak-hunting misinformation put about from the office , I 'd believe this when I see it . ( or more accurately when I see it listed in TV Guide and decide to watch a different channel instead . ) <p> This definitely makes the ' Starfleet Academy ' concept look more real . As you may recall , a few weeks ago Mr. Showbiz seemed very certain about his ' Flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another source that the concept has at least been discussed . Personally I would n't be at all surprised if Series V does indeed turn out to be Starfleet Academy-based , though , of course , nothing at all has been officially confirmed yet . <p> Now that the ' Flight Academy ' thing is a bit more topical again , you might want to re-read Valentine Winter 's Defending Flight Academy article , which we published at the Trek Nation about a month ago .

Most of the interview deals with Deep Space Nine ( and its possible future ) , Voyager , and ' Insurrection , ' though he also talks a bit about the future of the franchise : <p> Berman is loathe to discuss plans for Star Trek X. " My conversations with Paramount about a future film have been very preliminary , " he reveals . " There certainly wo n't be any film in 1999 or 2000 . At the earliest , the next Star Trek film would be out in 2001 . The Star Trek IMAX film is on a very distant back burner . It 's not dead like a dead crushed cockroach , but it 's not an immediate possibility either . It has nothing to do with creative elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation comes to a close , Berman turns to the subject of his own company , Rick Berman Productions , and any upcoming projects that we can expect to hear about soon . " Hopefully , we 'll start to see things very soon , " he says . " We 've has things in the works , but I needed to concentrate on Insurrection , finish out DS9 and wrap Voyager for the season . We 've got some very interesting projects that we 'll be starting up , but I ca n't talk about them yet . Maybe the next time we speak I 'll be able to give you more information .

A new article in the New York Post talks about Star Trek 's success after Star Trek , and talks about how little he actually got from his actual participation on Star Trek : <p> The " Star Trek " phenomenon is a $9 billion business , but little has gone into the pockets of its first star , William Shatner . Despite the short-changing , the 68-year-old actor has still managed to build a personal fortune in excess of $20 million . <p> Correct me if I 'm wrong here , but I 'm almost 100% certain Shatner does have a deal which grants him a set percentage of all Trek merchandise sales . At least one of the behind-the-scenes books I own ( probably ' Inside Star Trek ' ) mentions this . The article also mentions Shatner 's Star Trek books : <p> Shatner has earned more than an estimated $9 million from the 4.7 million copies of his books and is finishing up the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Trek Science .

Christian ( 4:41 pm CST ) For this ' Hello World ! , ' I 'm going to assume you 've already read the news report about Starfleet Academy becoming a possibility for Series V again . Personally I think this will either be one of the best Star Trek series ever done , or the complete destruction of the Star Trek franchise - there is n't a middle road for a concept such as ' Starfleet Academy . ' <p> On the one hand , ' Flight Academy ' could be the series Valentine Winter pictured in his Defending Flight Academy series . It could offer us a unique look at how Earth ( and the rest of the Solar System ) really looks like in the Star Trek universe , as we 've never gotten a good look at that . Finally , we 'd be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those select few in Star Trek . We 'd even be able to get some great DS9-style political stories , but then dealing with the politics of the Federation . The cadets would n't even need to be all teens - because of the exclusivity of Starfleet Academy , even the human cadets would be at least in their mid-twenties , while we could also have aliens and non-coms enter the Academy for an even more mixed age division . If they go for this kind of series , I 'm sure I 'll love it even more than Deep Space Nine . <p> On the other hand , we could get ' Starfleet Academy 90120 , ' dealing with the problems of a bunch of teen cadets . Instead of meaningful episodes exploring various aspects of humanity , we 'd get to hear about Bolian Cadet Brok not being able to get human Cadet Jones because she does n't like blue . All long-time Trek fans would hate the series , and it would be the end of the franchise . <p> Unfortunately , as we have n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , we do n't even know for sure yet that the series will actually be set on Starfleet Academy ) , I really do n't know if the producers will go for the first or the second option . Certainly , recent events ( such as the WWF news ) have made me a lot less optimistic , but I still prefer to give Rick Berman the benefit of the doubt - he did , after all , also create Deep Space Nine and keep the franchise running for the past decade , which certainly deserves some respect . For now , I 'll give Paramount the benefit of the doubt , and say that I think Starfleet Academy might actually be a good concept for Star Trek . Now let 's just wait and see what actually happens and if the new series will really be Starfleet Academy - unfortunately , that 's all we can do . <p> Wrestlers To Appear On VoyagerChristian ( 4:07 pm CST ) No , I did n't want to believe it either when I first heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The August 6 edition of the Ross Report , apparently a weekly Wrestling newsletter , contains the following news bit : <p> UPN 's " Star Trek : Voyager " is interested in featuring several WWF Superstars in upcoming episodes this season . Apparently , producers already have a solid concept that would feature the Big Boss Man . <p> ' Big Boss Man ' is the nice gentleman you see here above , who , as his official bio informs me , weighs 315 pounds , originates from Georgia , and has a ' finishing move ' called the ' Boss Man Slam . ' Strangely enough , his acting abilities are n't mentioned anywhere on the page . What are your thoughts on this ? Will The Man be able to return Voyager to meaningful character episodes , or is this just another cheap ploy to get higher ratings ? Let us know at feedback@treknation.com ! Major thanks go out to Jose Gonzalez for pointing me to this ! <p> Three Trek Convention ReportsChristian ( 4:07 pm CST ) Jason Davidson'sStar Trek News has put up three reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most interesting report deals with an appearance by Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) , who talked about the reason for Terry Farrell 's departure from DS9 : <p> He seems happier about DS9 now . When I saw him a few years ago he was not very happy . Then he mentoned the raise he got for season seven ( mystery solved ! ) . <p> The most interesting tibit he had was that Terry Farrell got the smallest raise for season seven . And that was why she left . Also , Terry did not want ANY footage of her in the finale since Paramount used footage of her WITHOUT her permission in a earlier episode . ( " Penumbra " ) . <p> ' Computer Graphics ' ReviewChristian ( 4:06 pm CST ) Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga just let me know that the Wednesday , August 4th issue of the Hollywood Reporter contains a review of ' Computer Graphics , ' the new documentary narrated by Leonard Nimoy . Reviewer Michael Rechtshaffen had this to say about Nimoy 's participation : <p> Given the target audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little heavy for non-pros , but the vivid pictures speak a thousand words . Leonard Nimoy 's narration lends the documentary a nice sense of authority . <p> The full review is also available online , but you 'll only be able to access it if you already subscribe to the paper . <p> ' Dorothy Dandridge ' ReviewChristian ( 4:06 pm CST ) Rooted has put up what is probably the first online review of ' Introducing Dorothy Dandridge , ' the new HBO movie starring Halle Berry and Brent Spiner ( Data ) . As Rooted is apparently based in Houston ( Spiner 's home ) , the review talks a lot about Spiner 's role in the film : <p> Portraying Dandridge 's manager Mills is actor Brent Spiner , a native of the Houston area . A youthful-looking 50 , Spiner plays Mills from approximately his mid-thirties into nearly his fifties , when he managed Dandridge 's career for 11 of the last 14 years of her life . <p> While you would normally anticipate an actor receiving second billing in a film to jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on his role with a good deal of subtlety , presenting Mills as an important element in Dandridge 's life without trying to overwhelm Berry the actress . <p> Trek Toy NewsChristian ( 4:06 pm CST ) For some reason I do n't seem to be able to come up with original headlines for Trek action figure news items . Anyway , the Raving Toy Maniac is reporting about a new promotion campaign by New Force Comics : <p> New Force Comics &amp; Collectibles is about to go live with the full-page ad for their upcoming exclusive Captain Kathryn Janeway as seen in the episode " Flashback " 4.5-inch action figure from Playmates . You can catch it in September issues of ToyShop ( 9/10 issue ) , Tomart 's Action Figure Digest ( issue #69 ) , Action Figure News &amp; Toy Review ( issue #84 ) , and the November issue of ToyFare ( #27 , November released issue ) , or simply click on the photo to the right . <p> The ad confirms that Janeway will be available in October and will retail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A chance to order the figure online can still be found at the top of the Toy Maniac 's news page . In related news , the Maniac is also reporting that Target has reduced the prices of the 12 " Insurrection and Wave 1 figures to just $23.90 . <p> In the past thirty-plus years , we have seen about 500 Star Trek episodes whose titles use over 1,400 words with an abundance of evocative words and phrases ranging from the trite ( " The Thaw ) to the poetic ( " Treachery , Faith And The Great River " ) to the bizarre ( " Spock 's Brain " ) . It would be fun to mix them together to form whole new ideas and expressions . And I hope they inspire some great fanfic stories . <p> Full details on this game , which was created by Stephen Mendenhall , can be found here . <p> If her plans work out , she will be on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn on Monday , October 4 .

More certain is that we 'll be seeing a re-borgified Seven-of-nine , and Jeri Ryan in a lot more leather . In fact , it seems the producers are going to moving Seven even more centre stage . <p> Great , just what Voyager needed - even more Seven of Nine . What do you think about this ?

Stars and admirers had the opportunity to mingle during various events , such as autograph sessions , panel discussions and the gala awards dinner .

" The important thing for me is that the fans who come and the stars who appear have a good time , and also that they feel good about themselves having been here .

Find it all here . <p> I reported that the full manual was up rather than the quickstart manual . I saw no reason for this mistake to supply pirates with a full copy of the manual .

The action drama revolves around a trio of covert agents working for a shadowy organization known as P.O.I.S.E. , whose mission is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One reason for the delay was that a pilot for " Secret Agent Man " was never produced ; UPN picked up the show on the strength of a short presentation reel . <p> As reported yesterday , Secret Agent Man 's Tuesday 9:00pm time slot will be filled by the casino-and-cops drama ' The Strip , ' but , as that series is n't ready yet , UPN will be showing extra Voyager re-runs from September the 14th until October the 5th . Full details on ' The Strip ' can be found in the full article . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:42 pm CST ) Several people wrote in to ask about the sudden disappearance of ' Today On TV ' from TrekToday yesterday . I 'm surprised that that many people actually cared about it , but the explanation is quite simple - I simply forgot to post it yesterday . I can assure you this was just a one-time occurence , and it 's back today again . <p> Want to Visit Star Trek : The Experience In Las Vegas ? Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me mailing you plane and admission tickets . I have created a media section on my site dedicated to the attraction in Vegas . It includes over 15 video from the ride , opening and interviews with Star Trek stars and over 25 pictures from the attraction including many CGI shots from the actual ride . It was my idea to make this section for the many Trek fans how can not afford the travel to Vegas and for thoughs out of the USA who will probably not have the chance to see it in there life time . <p> it seems that a number of people at NASA have taken to refering to STS-93 commander Eileen Collins as " Janeway " - as in Katherine Janeway , commander of the starship " Voyager " . The nickname is meant in a most complimentary way for the cool manner with which Collins handled her technically challenging ascent into orbit on STS-93 . <p> Well , apparently Star Trek is still an influence at NASA : - ) . Thanks go out to Katy Quinn for pointing me to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it 's late , and unfortunately it 's also rather short - several article writers were n't yet able to respond to mails about their articles , unfortunately .

Find all that and more here ! <p> Unsung Heroes : Mr. HoganChristian ( 4:01 pm CST ) Who ? That wrestler ? No , Mr. Hogan , one of Voyager 's Maquis crew members , who appeared in about half a dozen episodes and whose skull was mentioned in one other . In a new installment of her ' Unsung Heroes ' series of articles , Julia Houston at Star Trek Fans tells us why his loss was especially tragic : <p> It all started with those red-shirted guys in TOS . Kirk , Spock , McCoy , Uhura and two guys in red shirts would beam down to some planet . Kirk might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a scratch . McCoy would get to say , at least once , " He 's dead , Jim . " And there would be two dead guys in red shirts . <p> The lesson , boys and girls ? Do n't get attached to the guys in the red shirts . TNG was more subtle , if not sneaky , about the body-count thing . The " red shirts " no longer wore red , and they often got lines and names before their console exploded or the cross-fire picked them off . DS9 expanded on that by giving us " red shirts " who showed up in a few episodes before they were whacked . <p> But it was Voyager who truly raised the stakes , not simply displaying minor characters with a few lines over a few shows , but actually developing them , making us like them and care about them , and then mercilessly killing them off . <p> Personally I must admit to never really caring that much about Mr. Hogan , but without any doubt there are many fans of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommend you check out the full article ! <p> Farrell One Of TV 's Sexiest 16Christian ( 4:00 pm CST ) The new edition of TV Guide contains a listing of TV 's 16 sexiest stars , which TV Guide chose together with Entertainment Tonight .

If there 's really nothing better to do ( the Home Shopping Network would be more entertaining ) then consider What You Leave Behind as time-killing fodder , but it 's not recommended . <p> More can be found in the full review . I do have to wonder why Davidson decided to start reviewing Trek novels for IGN Sci-Fi - in most of his reviews , he has been telling us about his dislike for novel versions of Star Trek , so why does he insist on reviewing them ? <p> No Secret Agent On UPNChristian ( 4:00 pm CST ) According to TV Guide , UPN 's wacky new spy drama ' Secret Agent Man ' has been shelved until midseason . The show was hailed as one of UPN 's saviours for next season , but apparently it still had a few problems to sort out . Instead of ' Secret Agent Man , ' TV Guide says UPN will now be running casino-and-cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot . <p> The three games are all based on Activision 's Star Trek license and appear to cover the major genres .

Those attending the fair can drop by Booth no. 917 for a look at these games . <p> GenCon should certainly be interesting for Star Trek fans , considering Decipher will also be organising Customizable Card Game tournaments . Again , if anyone is actually going to the con , I 'd really appreciate receiving a report when you get back ! <p> ' Drone ' Overnight RatingsChristian ( 3:59 pm CST ) Ultimate TV just posted the Wednesday overnight ratings report for the six ' big ' networks .

Voyager got a 1.7 and was nr. 107. 1.7 is the lowest rating ever for a Voyager episode , but not the first time , because both a first run ( Juggernaut ) and a rerun have also gotten a 1.7 . ( Bride of Chaotica ) <p> UPNs highest rated show was Moesha with a 1.9 . Malcome And Eddie and Between Brothers also got a 1.7 . <p> TrekWeb has posted a report about a new episode called ' Alice , ' which is apparently filming this week . Take a look at how they describe the episode : <p> An Alien Spacecraft that is possesed tries to manipulate Paris . Paris dumps B'Elanna to go deal with this spaceship . However , this is not the end of the Paris/Torres relationship !

Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions were n't what they used to be - interest in Star Trek on the whole is declining , and many fans prefer the online Trek community over real conventions . Kuhn decided to visit a convention again , to see if they 're still worth visiting . According to her it is , citing as one of the main attractions of a convention the chance to actually meet some of the Trek actors : <p> Yes , friends , a big draw for con-goers is still the thrill of seeing your favorite Trek icons up close and personal and hearing their behind-the-scenes dish . The Portland con featured this tidbit from DS9 's now-blonde Nana Visitor : " Louise Fletcher ( Kai Winn ) is one of the sweetest women . And she has the most girlish giggle . " Ca n't you all just picture that faux goody-goody portrait of evil , Kai Winn , getting all silly over some wacky prank pulled during the Vedek Assembly meeting ? Now you can . <p> It 's also fun to watch your favorite folks unwittingly morph into their characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Kira to get together with Gul Dukat , " Nana related , suddenly sounding very stern and Kira-ish .

Similarly , Rene Auberjonois greeted the crowd with his trademark Odo growl : " Settle down out there . What do you think this is ... Quark 's ? " <p> Other reasons for going to conventions include the merchandise sections and the chance to actually meet fellow Trekkers , as Kuhn tells us in the full article , together with a few tips on how to make going to conventions even more pleasant . <p> GenCon Decipher ScheduleChristian ( 3:56 pm CST ) Decipher , the publisher of the official Star Trek Customizable Card Game , has put up a complete schedule of Decipher events being held at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee .

' In the interview , Lauren also talks a bit about working with Ryan : <p> " She 's insane - I 'm troubled , but she 's insane , " laughed Lauren of Ryan 's character . " She plays a woman who calls herself a debutante . Are n't debutantes supposed to be 17 ? There 's something Glass Menagerie going on there ! " Describing Lydia as " just this prettier-than-thou perky little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is so much better in this film than it is for Seven of Nine . I do n't fault her for Star Trek , but there 's only so much you can do when you 're playing a Borg robot . " <p> " Jeri Ryan is completely different in this film than in anything she 's ever done , " Lauren added , noting that " too much of Hollywood is about breasts , or the big blonde thing . Lynn - her name is Jeri Lynn , I always called her Lynn - is really a great actress . I was blown away by her work . We had a real mutual respect for each other , and we got along really well . She 's so funny in this film , I had nothing but a good time talking to her and I think we helped each other .

GameFan has put up a short preview of Activision 's new Star Trek game for the Playstation , which will be called ' Red Squad . ' In the preview , they tell us a bit more about the premise and the graphics : <p> Red Squad is still very early in development - the project was initated some six months ago , but the game already looks very promising . The Trek license obviously brings a unique richness and atmosphere to the game , as well as a solid backstory ... something that Colony Wars lacked . The player does n't get to control the U.S.S. Enterprise ; instead , you 'll control a small starfighter in a series of campaigns against the Borg , Romulans etc ... The missions look far cooler than anything found in Colony Wars , with a much more forgiving learning curve . <p> Since that 's pretty much all that is known about the gameplay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) lay some technobabble on you . Red Squad will run at 30fps , with over ten ships battling at the same time , all highlighted by dynamic lighting from multiple light-sources . A lot of attention has been paid to the size of the ships , so the Romulan Warbirds are truly massive ( and the cloaking effect is smoking ! ) when compared to the player 's puny starfighter . Just imagine the enormous Borg cube ! <p> A bit more on the developer can be found in the full preview . ' Red Squad ' definitely has potential - just think about it : Activision could get both Wesley Crusher and Nog to make guest appearances ! <p> UPN Fall ScheduleChristian ( 3:54 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has put up the official UPN Fall 1999 Schedule , listing all the shows which struggling network UPN will be showing next season .

All the shows are presented with the official press picture and the press release description , and they can be found here . <p> You will probably receive it early next week , we have gone gold ( finaled ) but it still takes some time to replicate the disks put them in jewel cases , put them in a box with all the other components - manual , ref card , ref poster , etc. then put those in a master carton that goes on a truck or in some case on a plane then it goes to Digital River and to our retailers ... well you get the picture : ) We conservatively allow 10 days for this entire process but you should receive it soon . <p> The original announcement can be found here .

All around me , the whole country is getting crazy about the full solar eclipse which will be taking place in England , France and a few other countries in Europe next week . Tens of millions of people will probably flock to the strip of land where the eclipse will actually be visible ( or rather : not visible ) , but I 'm not nearly as excited as everyone else seems to be . <p> My brother , on the other hand , has been wildly excited about it for months now . He 's even planning to travel to North France to see the event next week . As is quite usual in our family , he also forgot to plan anything , so now it 's extremely hard to even get there , let alone find a hotel which still has room . Things will presumably be even worse when the event is over , and millions of people will want to get back at the same time . <p> I really ca n't understand why anyone would want to spend two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two minutes .

This week 's installment was written by David E. Sluss , who has been providing the net with the world 's most biting ( and entertaining ) reviews of Star Trek episodes at the Cynics Corner . As could be expected from him , he 's not all that positive about Star Trek 's future : <p> Star Trek is in serious trouble , folks .

The Starbase-1 Coffee Company has sent out a press release about its upcoming Star Trek bottled water , which will go by the name of ' Altair Water .

The main features of the magazine are interviews with Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) and Wil Wheaton , though it also contains an interview with Voyager 's Executive Producer Brannon Braga . The interview was conducted quite a while ago , apparently , as is evidenced by the following quote : <p> Ron is a very talented writer , and I do n't know exactly what he 'll bring . He is probably , in my opinion , the best Star Trek writer of all . He just has a passion for the franchise . He is able to take an ordinary star trek story and bring a unique spin to it . I could n't ask for anyone better than Ron . I think he 's very , very good with character . I 'm looking forward to seeing what he does with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month 's edition of the magazine include a feature on the creation of Deep Space Nine , plus ' technical briefings ' on the various Trek ships .

Take a look at what Dark Horizons has to report : <p> Some more names have been revealed to have joined the cast of the mountain climbing thriller " Vertical Limit " . Robin Tunney ( " The Craft " ) , Scott Glenn ( " The Silence of the Lambs " ) and Temeura Morrison ( " Once Were Warriors " ) will all be joining Chris O'Donnell , Bill Paxton , Isabella Scorpuro ( " Goldeneye " ) , Alexander Siddig ( TV 's " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) on the film which is about to begin shooting on New Zealand 's South Island . Under the helm of Director Martin Campbell ( " The Mask of Zorro " ) , shooting is expected to wrap around January-February next year for release mid-2000 . NZ 's famous Mt . Cook and its surrounding peaks will be doubling for the Hindu Kush in Pakistan . Morrison is playing the role of a Pakistani helicopter pilot . Thanks to ' Shaun ' . <p> The original report can be found at the Dark Horizons news page . Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for this . <p> It is perhaps the greatest of all ironies that one of DS9 's biggest criticisms when it launched in 1993 was that the setting was " too static . " Now , more than six years later , DS9 has ended as the Trek series to have supplied the most ongoing changes in story and setting , while Voyager is still essentially doing the same things it always has--wandering a Delta Quadrant that offers little in terms of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just have lots of " space . " But what 's in this space ? As of now , I 'm inclined to call it a static , primarily empty area of space--traveled by a starship that covers a lot less ground than a certain space station sitting stationery at the mouth of a certain wormhole . <p> It 's too bad Voyager ca n't hold up when one steps back and looks at everything , because the paradox is that I find the series still supplies reasonable , enjoyable entertainment in short bursts . The indictment , I think , is that it could and should supply a lot more than that . See you in the fall . <p> The full analysis , which I personally tend to agree with , can be found here . <p> When a person talks about the Star Trek Franchise , most of the time they are referring to the television shows and theatrical releases .

The paper contained an article by Maryjean Wall , looking at his recent selling of 25 American saddlebred horses : <p> Shatner recently sold one farm and bought another in Woodford County with longtime saddlebred owner and trainer Donna Moore . The new property , fronting Versailles Road and Blue Grass Parkway , is larger than his previous farm , Belle reve on Shannon Run Road , but has fewer stalls for horses . <p> The sale ' was an effort to reduce the size of my stock to fit in 19 stalls , ' said Shatner .

One of the things he 's praised for is his diversity : <p> Goldsmith 's refusal to repeat himself is admirable , says writer-director Michael Crichton , who 's worked with the composer on six films , including " Coma " and " The Great Train Robbery . " But it makes it harder to identify his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and he was desperately seeking alternatives . <p> " I watched the video of ' Air Force One ' and said , ' That 's terrific--maybe I hold Jerry in too high esteem , ' " recalls Crichton , whose " 13th Warrior " is due out in August . " The credits rolled : ' Jerry Goldsmith . ' I look at Anthony Hopkins in ' The Edge . ' ' Pretty good music , ' I said to myself . The credits rolled : ' Jerry Goldsmith . ' Jerry is the most varied and inventive film composer of our time--a real pro who does what the picture calls for , which is a vanishing breed in Hollywood .

Bub at GamePen has written a new feature dedicated to 3 of the upcoming Star Trek games - ' Voyager : Elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil . ' Take a look at what the feature tells us about ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil : ' <p> Unlike most adventure games , do not expect full response dialogue trees . Instead , characters may or may not talk to you depending on what you are carrying . An item may gain a good reaction , while holding a phaser just is n't friendly . Tricordors will be an essential puzzle-solving tool and communicators will be used so you can keep tabs on Data and Picard to see what they are up to , gain advice , or coordinate exploration . <p> Of course , the brand new Enterprise E will appear towards the end . Ship-to-ship combat may not be in the cards , but a rendered starship interior should please fans and provide a compelling backdrop against whatever the developers have in store . We 'll see just how compelling a digital sequel to the film is when it is released sometime before Christmas . <p> The full article can be found here . Thanks go out to Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Voyager season 5 report , which , as could be expected , was n't all that positive : <p> This season was certainly looking promising for a time , turning very strong November , December , January , and February performances . The show , for a time , seemed to be overcoming its huge coverage deficit . " Timeless , " " Thirty Days , " " Nothing Human , " and " Dark Frontier " turned in the strongest showings of the season , each propelling themselves over a 4.0 . In March and April , however , the show suffered a complete nervous breakdown . No episode after " Dark Frontier " topped the 4.0 mark and only a handfull even managed to get over the 3.5 mark . " The Fight " is the standing champion as far as low Voyager ratings go , earning only a 2.9 . " Juggernaut " aired on a special night , so it does n't get counted into most of the calculations for Voyager 's season , but did set the standing all-time low mark Voyager has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That mark has since been tied by one hiatus episode this summer . The season also ended on a surprisingly weak note , seeing " Equinox " rate lower than both " Warhead " and " Relativity . " <p> As far as the explanation for the late season drop goes , the prime suspect is baseball . UPN 's affiliates are so weakly tied to the network that the stations ( of which many own contracts to show the local baseball games ) have no problem pre-empting UPN 's lineup to show their local games . This can bump Voyager out of its 9:00 timeslot which means that the number of homes watching Voyager in that city goes into the books as a zero . There is also some evidence that UPN 's coverage has slipped even more and that it is probably only now airing in about 65 percent of the nation . <p> After that came the final DS9 season report , which was a lot more positive : <p> DS9 's final season was the first to buck DS9 's typical trend of starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks to the publicity of DS9 's end , the final 8 weeks of the season proved to be just as strong as the earlier parts of the season . This year was also the first time that a May Sweeps period averaged a higher rating than the February Sweeps period three months earlier . This only proves what many have suspected : had DS9 recieved the full support of Paramount as it did during the Final Chapter , it may have fared better over the years . Even comparing this season to DS9 's previous years , the show did fairly well , better than it had ever done before in comparison to the previous season . <p> The full Voyager Report and the full DS9 report contain a more detailed analysis , plus a comparison of the previous seasons ' statistics with the most recent season . <p> New Starfleet Journal AppearsChristian ( 3:34 pm CST ) Volume 2 , Issue 8 , of the Starfleet Journal , the only monthly Star Trek online magazine has just appeared .

At 20:00 BST tomorrow , they 'll be showing the two-hour telemovie ' Dark Frontier . ' <p> For this ' Hello World ! , ' I assume you will have read the news update about Viacom complaining to a site which was hosting a digitized version of the DS9 finale . <p> As I also said when the ' What You Leave Behind ' video first appeared on this site , I do not at all find it surprising that Paramount objected to this . The site in question claims to have been just linking to the video , but this certainly was not how the video was presented - it was embedded inside a page hosted on this one site , and every site which mentioned the appearance of the news video linked to this specific page . The impression was strongly created that the video clip was actually part of this site , even though the video clip was hosted on a mirror Geocities site . In the same way , if I would include an ' adult ' picture here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web host would still shut me down , as the picture would appear to be part of TrekToday . <p> Personally I strongly support Paramount taking steps against this - not only was it a blatant violation of copyright , it was also extremely bad for the Star Trek franchise , as this meant less income through foreign tape sales . This is something Star Trek fans should consider when watching the episodes online - if this means less Star Trek videos will be bought , it will also decrease Star Trek 's chances for the future , as less money is brought in . I find the posting of complete Star Trek episodes on the net highly objectionable , and I would like to ask all webmasters to refrain from doing this . <p> What are your thoughts on this ? Please let me know at feedback@treknation.com , so we can use it in the mailbag - I 'm extremely interested to hear what you all think about this . <p> Saturday July 31 , 1999 <p> Keith R.A DeCandido InterviewChristian ( 4:10 pm CST ) I promised this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - our interview with Keith R.A.

This week 's article was written by Steve Perry , who regularly reviews Star Trek episodes for TrekWeb.com . Steve is rather positive about the future of the franchise , though he also signals a few problems : <p> Is Trek dead ? No . Is it dying ? No . <p> Trek has a base fandom that I think can be preserved . Through thick and thin , DS9 remained the top rated drama in syndication . In a crowded syndication market , that 's good . <p> But that does n't mean Trek 's future is by any means guaranteed . The ratings remain good , but the big problem has n't hit yet . As De Kelley 's recent death reminded us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer of us can tell which TOS episodes the actress Diana Muldaur , who would go on to play Dr. Pulaski , was in . I 'm not saying that we 're all about to die off , just that a lot of the old reliable fans are getting to be older and somewhat less reliable . That 's a demographic CBS wants , not one Trek needs . <p> As ever , read the full article by going here . If , after that , you have any comments to make , please send them in to feedback@treknation.com so we can print them in the mailbag ! Next week 's article is probably going to be a lot less positive , as it will be written by David E. Sluss of the Cynics Corner - I 'm already looking forward to it ! <p> New Voyager Syndication PromosChristian ( 3:43 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions , who just moved his server to his own home in order to limit the site 's downtime , has just uploaded several new Voyager syndication promos .

Thanks go out to Tim Callahan for the link . <p> Play ' Blaze of Glory ' FirstChristian ( 3:43 pm CST ) According to the Decipher web site , the introduction of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game expansion pack ' Blaze of Glory ' has been delayed until August 18th . Though this may sound bad , there is actually a good side to it for active CCG tournament players : <p> Please note these important changes to tournaments at the two big upcoming conventions : GenCon August 5 - 8 in Milwaukee , and Comicon in San Diego , August 13 - 15 . Since the release date of Blaze of Glory has been delayed until August 18th , the Star Trek Customizable Card Game sealed deck events at these conventions will now be pre-release events . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to play with these exciting new cards . ... Players who enter these tournaments will be given a pre-constructed battle side deck along with one Star Trek Starter Deck II and 4 Blaze of Glory booster packs . <p> STRANGE NEW WORLDS II features a plethora of time travel stories ( always my favorite sci-fi narrative device ) and quite a few familiar faces , from Gillian of STAR TREK IV to temporal investigators Dulmer and Lucsley from DS9 's " Trials and Tribble-ations . " Of note are the top three prize-winners ( the book awards top honors to the best of the selected stories for each volume ) , " I Am Klingon , " " Triptych , " and the first prize winner , " A Ribbon for Rosie . " While DS9 is under-represented , perhaps it will be better served in the third collection , which I certainly hope will be on its way soon . Get to those PADDs and get writing , Trekkies ! It 's time to chart a course for some new voyages of your own . <p> Klingon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onion just posted a rather amusing new story , dealing with the Klingon Language phenomenon . The story is based on a report which was supposedly released by the Modern Language Society on Monday , which stated that speakers of the Star Trek-based Klingon language outnumber individuals fluent in Navajo by a margin of more than seven-to-one : <p> " Navajo , a 3,000-year-old Native American tonal language belonging to the Athabaskan/Na-DenT group of tongues , is clearly dying and will likely be extinct by 2010 , " MLA president Frederick Toback said . " Fortunately , though , the sad , steady decline of this once-proud Native American tongue has been more than offset by a rising interest in Klingon culture . " <p> Klingon speakers said they are pleased with the report . " Every day , more and more people are discovering the excitement and challenge of Klingon , or , as it 's called by native speakers , tlhIngan-Hol , " said Doug " HoD trI'Qal " Petersen , an official grammarian at the Klingon Language Institute . " After just a few weeks of studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mey poSmoH Hol ! ' " <p> The hilarious full article can be found here . Just to avoid all confusion - this is a satire , and should not at all be taken as fact . Rather amusingly , I see several people on the net who do n't seem to be getting that : - ) .

More specifically , she owns an iMac and she 's excited about the iBook , she said . <p> More mentions of Macs can be found in the full article . Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for ponting me to this . <p> Captain Riker just sent a report about a recent science-fiction convention he visited , which had Eric Pierpont ( from the ' Alien Nation ' show ) as one of its main guests . At the con , Pierpoint mentioned he 'll be making an appearance on Voyager next season , as a Klingon . This Klingon is apparently a doomed individual who has been put in charge of taking the Klingons who died a dishonourable death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to hell on the ' Barge of the Dead , ' hence the name of the episode . Major thanks go out to Captain Riker for sending this in ! <p> Michael Dorn In ' Shadow Hours'Christian ( 3:40 pm CST ) Cinescape is reporting about a new film called ' Shadow Hours , ' which will feature Peter Weller ( from Buckaroo Banzai ) as the Devil . The film is written and directed by Isaac Eaton , and one of the other stars in the movie is Michael Dorn ( Worf ) . <p> Leonard Nimoy Y2K VideoChristian ( 3:40 pm CST ) ZDNe has a new article by Bob Strauss , looking at the new ' Y2K Family Survival Guide ' video , narrated by Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) . In the article , Nimoy talks about what he thinks will happen on the 1st of January , 2000 : <p> " I 'm not an alarmist , and I do n't have time to be negative , " Nimoy says . But shooting the video did alert him to some important Y2K issues : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country at that time , and if I were a farmer in Montana , I 'd want to have a butane supply . My biggest concern is the effect Y2K might have on important facilities , such as atomic generators , power plants , and hospitals . And if you 're a person who relies on medication , you should get a supply in advance . " <p> Of course , Nimoy is well aware that much of his authority in the public 's mind comes from his stint as chief science officer on the starship Enterprise . " I 'm identified with technology and future science , and I like to keep up with new developments , " he says . " People tend to believe me , and I have tried to protect that credibility . " Still , Nimoy does n't consider himself much of a PC wonk , though the high-tech gizmos in his office a Palm III organizer , a Sony VAIO laptop , and a digital video camera belie his modesty . <p> Some thoughts from Nimoy on how this ties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are few words more famous in the history of television than those that began the opening sequence for Gene Roddenberry 's Star Trek . Despite being an early flop , the adventures of James T. Kirk and his starship , Enterprise , have become an eminently recognizable facet of science fiction the world over . The show ran for many seasons , even longer in syndication , and spawned six movies and countless novels revolving around its characters . In the 1990 's , the legacy of Star Trek has continued to grow with the creation of the wildly popular " sequel " series Star Trek : The Next Generation ( which itself ended up on the silver screen and bookshelves everywhere ) and its spinoffs , Deep Space Nine and Voyager . All in all , Roddenberry 's vision of a future in which mankind can put the violent past behind and reach for the stars has captivated the imagination of the public at large for years , and shows little sign of slowing down . <p> And the computer game industry is coming along for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in the market , releases bearing the venerable license have generally been few and far between ; almost events in and of themselves . The coming year , however , will see a veritable explosion of Trek titles hitting the shelves , as the splitting of the license by Paramount into different timelines ( classic series , Next Generation , etc. ) has left several design houses in possession of the rights to one aspect of Trek or another . But what 's great about this flood of transporters and tribbles onto computers everywhere is that , whereas once Trek titles were restricted to one or two genres , there can truly be said to be something coming for everyone . <p> The full feature has previews of every Trek game currently in development , and is definitely worth checking out - if you only want to read one Trek gaming preview , make sure it 's this one !

Christian ( 3:36 pm CST ) For some reason the temperature seems to have made an incredible jump here since yesterday . Fortunately the room I 'm currently in is located on the North side of the building - otherwise I would really have fainted while doing this update . <p> Hello there , and welcome to the first in what I 'm planning as a series of articles on the " Unsung Heroes " of Star Trek . This idea comes from a recent winner of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in their own articles . <p> Nyota Uhura ( her first name is n't 100% canon and means " star " in Swahili , her last name means " freedom " ) served as a lieutenant aboard the Enterprise , a lieutenant-commander about the Enterprise-A , and was last seen with a commander 's rank . Her specialty is communications , and although TOS usually gave her nothing more to do than say " Hailing frequencies open , sir , " she sometimes got out her Starfleet-issue toolbox and fixed up the wires and lights of her communications board . <p> It 's difficult to know what to think of Uhura now , looking back on TOS from a perspective of over thirty years . If she were a character on television today , the show would n't get boycotted , but it would hardly be praised for furthering female roles . In its own time , however , there 's no question that it was revolutionary . <p> ' Birth of the Federation ' PatchChristian ( 3:02 pm CST ) Microprose has just released the official version 1.02 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new turn-based strategy game .

Kill me ? Both WebTrek and the Universe put up new info on the last Voyager episodes of this season . First of all , the Universe received the following info from insider 007 : <p> It deals with Janeway having this facination about an ancestor of hers that inspired her to join starfleet . Janeway has always been told great tales about this woman ( Shannon O'Donnel ) and how she worked on all of the Mars projects , and in particular one project called the millineum gate that was very controversial , and had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the show , Paris informs her that he knows all there is to know about Mars history , and her ancestor had nothing to do with it .

Mulgrew plays the part of her ancestor . <p> In the end , we find out that it was passed down in her family over the generations , and that her ancestor was nobody who did n't  do much of anything except consult on the millineum gate , and the whole town actually WANTED the gate built . <p> In the episode , Janeway also has a love interested played by Kevin Tighe . The great WebTrek posted a picture of him , which I decided to reprint above .

In the process , this Federation ship kidnaps a couple of our crew members . Will Janeway be able to rescue them ? <p> Lastly , the Universe also posted some new info on the Equinox reshoots : <p> What is done is about 39 minutes worth of the final show , the rest is still being shot .

" I had a lot of huge storylines . She was a new character and I had to quickly tie her in with everyone else 's storylines , introduce her backstory and figure out her place in the crew .

Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations , in Tuvok 's book - and Chakotay 's , and Janeway 's - seems to be limited to races whose behaviors fit their own personal codes of proper comportment . <p> Yes , Torres was very naughty to break Doc 's camera , but considering that she has a job to do in engineering making sure the ship runs properly and does n't blow up , it 's understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at least she did n't break his nose . She 's obviously a vastly better engineer than anyone else on board ( well , except Seven , and Tom , and Neelix , but let 's just block all those past episodes out for now ) , so like the exceptions Picard made for Worf to do things his way , Janeway should be doing the same for her Klingon Terrible . <p> ' In Defense Of B'Elanna ' continues in the full review , which also includes a detailed synopsis of the episode .

More can be found in the full article , but also at the official ' Building Virtual Worlds ' web site . <p> Voyager Game Creators InterviewedChristian ( 12:20 pm CST ) Geoff Keighley at GamePen just put up an interview with Kenn Hoekstra , Brian Raffel and Brian Pelletier , top dogs at Raven Software . In the interview , they mostly talk about their upcoming ' Soldier of Fortune ' game , though some info on ' Star Trek : Voyager ' is also presented : <p> Geoff : Let 's talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games have never really been successful . The last Star Trek action game , Klingon Honor Guard , was a complete disgrace to the franchise . So , what is Raven going to do to patch up Star Trek 's reputation in the gaming arena ? Are you looking at another 3D shooter in the Star Trek universe , or something more ? <p> Brian Pelletier : There are a lot of Star Trek fans at Raven and all of them are putting their input into the Voyager project . We know that Honor Guard missed the mark and we are working very closely with Paramount to ensure that the game is authentic and fun with an intriguing story . Raven is taking this very seriously and we are confident that we can make a compelling game that is true both to Star Trek and to action gaming . You can be assured that the Voyager game wo n't be " just another 3D shooter in the Star Trek universe . " It will be much more . <p> A little bit more info can be found in the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Kenn Hoekstra for mentioning this in his . plan file . <p> Cinescape Spoils ' The Changing Face ... ' Christian ( 12:19 pm CST ) As every week , Cinescape'sMichael Marek has put up his spoiler-packed report of this week 's new Deep Space Nine episode , ' The Changing Face Of Evil . ' Some pretty major things happen in this episode ( including several things that were floating around on the net as Very Major Spoilers ) , so if you still want to be surprised by the episode you would be advises not to read the Cinescape report . If you do want to read it , you can do so by going here . <p> Janeway &amp; Seven To Leave Voyager ? Christian ( 12:19 pm CST ) Backstage Pass finally fixed the link to its Voyager report , so I was able to see what news they posted a few days ago . First of all , they 're confirming the reshoots for ' Equinox , ' which has apparently been dubbed ' The Episode That Would n't Die ' by Voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the following tidbit : <p> Other scuttlebut coming out of the Voyager camp has Kate Mulgrew grumbling about leaving the series ( again ) . The interesting twist this time is that Jeri Ryan appears to be interested in leaving the series as well ( which would probably hurt the show more than Mulgrew 's departure ) . <p> Hopefully this is just a rumour - certainly Jeri Ryan wanting to leave is completely unexpected . <p> Backstage Pass is also reporting on transfers by several members of the DS9 production crew . Apparently Michael and Denise Okuda have already agreed to move over , while other members of the DS9 writing and production staff have also been asked to transfer . Find more in the full report . <p> Update , 20:50 CET : Heather Jarman , columnist at the Starfleet Journal just sent me some more info on the matter : <p> A couple of months back in Jeri Ryan 's chat on ST Contin. , Jeri mentioned that she and Kate are both contracted through the end of the 6th season . That may be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kate to both leave and not just Kate . Apparently , both actresses would need to re-negotiate contracts . <p> In all possibility , then , Mulgrew and Ryan are leaking some rumours to the press in order to have a stronger bargaining position with the producers , who have stated several times they want to go for the full seven seasons . Major thanks go out to Heather for reporting this ! <p> ' It 's Green'Christian ( 12:18 pm CST ) Gail Appleson , one of the writers at Yahoo 's Daily News , had a lot of fun describing ' Blavod , ' a new *black* variety of Vodka . In his article , he makes no less than three Star Trek references , concluding even with a recipe for creating a Star Trek drink : <p> To make a drink that looks like it came right out of Star Trek , try pouring cranberry juice into a glass and topping it with a layer of Blavod . The effect is even more spectacular when the two are mixed , resulting in a royal purple liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ' for that combination . <p> You can find more about this rather aggressive drink by visiting BlackVodka.com , or you can just read the actual article by going here . <p> -In the UK , Sky One will be showing the not-so-good first-season DS9 episode ' Vortext ' at 17:00 BST and at 23:30 BST . <p> -Tomorrow at 02:00 CET , German station Sat.1 will be repeating TNG 's ' In der Hand von Terroristen ' ( Starship Mine ) . Tomorrow at 15:00 CET they 'll be showing ' Der Feuersturm ' ( Lessons ) , which is worth watching for the ' Inner Light ' music alone . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 12:17 pm CST ) The Trek BBS now has more than 90 registered members , almost guaranteeing a constant stream of interesting threads . Take a look at three of the discussions that are currently going on : <p> -Continuing the ' The Best ...

Unfortunately , one of those did n't include a valid URl , another one was n't a Star Trek site , and yet another site was already listed in our database , so we actually just had two new sites yesterday . One of those is the following : <p> Some of the other sites that were added over the past week to our database of 1025 Star Trek sites can be found by going here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 12:16 pm CST ) For close to a decade now , I 've been a huge fan of Roxette , the Swedish pop group . I own all their records , have spent thousands of guilders on completing my collection , and usually have one of their latest CDs on while updating TrekToday . <p> As you can imagine , I was rather happy when I heard on the Roxette mailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxette Weekend ' next weekend . However , I was absolutely amazed when I saw on MTV itself that the preview for that weekend was based on Star Trek ! In the preview , you see a transporter room , on the walls of which several Roxette clips are shown . Then , Roxette appear via transporter beam , and a voice-over says that , this weekend , ' MTV will be beaming the best Roxette videos to your home . ' <p> Is that a coincidence or what ? I 'd almost think something more is at work here than mere human powers .... ; - ) <p> After the previous week 's abysmal performance , it was good to see a slight recovery for Star Trek on BBC2 . TNG 's " Time 's Arrow , Part 2 " gave the series a boost by 6 places to #13 , although the number of viewers , at 2.79m , was still quite low compared to ratings earlier in the year . Meanwhile , Voyager did well considering the very intermittent schedule it 's had - " Concerning Flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The viewing figure of 2.58m was lower than offerings earlier in the year , but for Voyager 's Sunday timeslot was respectable . <p> However , DS9 first season reruns continued the appalling performance from the week before - this week 's " Vortex " was not in the top 30 programmes , and so no actual viewing figures were available . <p> Actual ratings , plus a historic rundown of the past several months , can be found by going here . <p> FocalPoint Issue 4 AppearsChristian ( 1:28 pm CST ) Finally , after more than two months , a new edition of FocalPoint has been sent out . FocalPoint is the newsletter published by Star Trek Central , and provides subscribers with a round-up of all the latest Star Trek news : <p> This " beginning of the end " four-parter of DS9 is starting to take a somewhat strange shape . While the powers that be are clearly aiming for a lot of twists and turns before we reach the series ' end , the twists themselves seem to alternate between the interesting , well-placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two major stories in " Strange Bedfellows " , one had a twist of the first variety , and one of the second . I 'm still engaged enough to be quite curious about what lies ahead , but some of the fervor from " ' Til Death Do Us Part " has faded . <p> More can be found in Tim Lynch 's full review , which was just put up at Psi Phi , and in which Lynch awards the episode a 7,5 . Find it all here . <p> Ezri In BikiniChristian ( 1:12 pm CST ) As you may already know , the May 1999 issue of Bikini Magazine contains an interview with Nicole DeBoer ( Ezri Dax ) . For those of you who have n't been able to find the actual magazine , wonderful Nicole DeBoer site Obsessive Attitudes put up a transcript of the article on the web . Take a look at a small quote from the article : <p> They say animals know when a disaster is coming . So if you live near Toronto and notice the cows getting nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town . While she claims her only attempt at cow tipping was ill-fated , she recalls the incident with a longing in her voice . Thought the Canadian-born actress has started eating meat again ( " I did n't for like 10 years " ) , she insists her days of bullying bovines is long behind her . Apparently there 's little time for livestock wrestling when you 're playing space shrink Ezri Dax on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . <p> " Yesterday we had to do a scene where we were hanging upside down , " she says . " Sometimes we do the weirdest things . I 'm hanging upside down while they 're fixing a light , and I 'm thinking , ' This is what I do for a living .

Some walk ' n talk in a corridor and Astrometrics <p> Who is in these scenes ? Jeri Ryan , Robert Picardo and some Equinox folks <p> According to what was previously reported , the reshoots became necessary after it was the decided that the show 's b-plot was too similar to one from the previous episode , ' Warhead . ' More info on this might later on be appearing at the Vulcan Cafe , thanks go out to Warp Eleven for pointing me to this . <p> TrekWeb Giveaway ExpandsChristian ( 1:11 pm CST ) For about a month now , TrekWeb has been running a special Autograph GiveAway , in which you could win autographed photos of James Doohan ( Scotty ) , Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) , Roxann Dawson ( B'Elanna Torres ) and Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) . The Doohan autograph has since been given away , but fortunately TrekWeb just added two additional items to the giveaway list : <p> An autographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Star Trek : First Contact ) , and to celebrate the end of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine this summer , one of the original 10,000 show bibles , written by creators Rick Berman and Michael Piller prior to the show 's premiere and completed on June 29th , 1992 !

Basically you 'll have to download a test version of @Backup , which , according to TrekWeb , is all you have to do . They conveniently forget to mention the fact that @Backup will be spamming you for the next month at least , but I guess that 's something a real fan will gladly go through to win those items . <p> " We wanted to introduce Naomi in ' Once Upon a Time .

She 's advanced far beyond a normal six-year-old from today , but is still deeply neurotic , and although she 's an enlightened little girl she has irrational fears as well , so she 's hopefully a textured little child . We just wanted to show an interesting child character . " <p> He says more in the full interview .

If you 're really anxious to see the trailers , they 've also been put up at Star Trek Interactive ! , though the image quality of those trailers is slightly lower than Vidiot 's . <p> Besides the ' When It Rains ... ' trailer , Vidiot also put up a special two-minute ' May Sweeps Program Filler , ' with which Paramount hopes to make lots of people watch the Final Chapter . At 21 MB , it 's a hefty download , but it does provide some very interesting teasers for the upcoming Final Chapter episodes .

The movie is a spoof that follows two would-be filmmakers and science fiction fans who get to meet Shatner , their TV idol , only to learn that he 's a hard-drinking woman chaser . <p> Free Enterprise earned awards for best picture and best screenplay at the 1998 AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival . It is scheduled to play at the Cannes Film Festival on May 15 before opening in Los Angeles on June 4 . <p> This is definitely a film I want to see - hopefully the film will also make it to the Netherlands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chakotay , now his chances are forever gone . AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz ( and a couple of thousand other sources ) are reporting that Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) married on Monday : <p> Kate Mulgrew , who plays Captain Kathryn Janeway on Star Trek Voyager , married Ohio politician Tim Hagan on Monday in Florida . The ceremony reportedly included only the couple and a friend of Mulgrew 's . <p> Mulgrew - who is expected to return next season to the series - has two sons from a previous marriage . Hagan - who did not seek reelection as Cuyahoga County Commissioner , and is currently on staff at Cleveland State University - has two daughters . <p> Congratulations to Kate Mulgrew , but let 's hope her marriage wo n't cause her to leave the series before the end of the seventh season . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 1:06 pm CST ) -Tonight at 9:00pm , UPN will be airing a new Star Trek Voyager episode in a special Monday night showing .

Voyager rescues two crewmen from an abandoned , out of control Malon freighter that 's about to unleash a theta radiation blast into the sector . Soon , Lieutenant Torres leads an away team to board the freighter and contain the poison - despite warnings from its crewman , Fesek and Pelk , about the Angel of Decay that wreaks havoc aboard the cargo ship . <p> Note that the above picture is , of course , copyrighted by Paramount . While we 're on the subject , let me just applaud UPN for temporarily replacing their main site with a page ' honoring the memory of those lost in the Columbine High School tragedy ' - this is truly styleful and I respect UPN for this . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 1:06 pm CST ) The difficulty with doing this ' Trek BBS Today ' is that , as I write this , the American day is n't even halfway through , so the listing of Today 's Active Topics also just lists a few current discussions . Still , even though most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting discussions have already been going on over the past few hours , including : <p> -After the ' Favourite Episode ' thread , board regular Spaceburger started a new thread , asking you what your favourite DS9 character is - make your choices known here . <p> -A very interesting new thread in the Voyager forum deals with the question of Star Trek and Homosexuality . In this thread , you can voice your support for a possible gay character on Trek , and hopefully someday the producers will actually include such a character in the show . ( BTW , related to this , does anyone know what happened to the Voyager Visibility Project , which also campaigned for this ? You heard a lot from them a few years ago , but now it seems they 've completely disappeared ) <p> And , as usual , many more discussions are taking place at the Trek BBS , and we 'd all absolutely love to hear from you ! Please feel free to add your thoughts to the current discussions , or perhaps even start a new thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just go ahead and open a channel ! <p> -TheTrek.Net is currently in beta , but when it opens it 'll provide you with up to the minute Trek news , database , episode libraries , and more . <p> For a look at all the other new Star Trek sites that were added to TrekSeek yesterday , take a look here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:05 pm CST ) Inspired by a recent discussion topic at the Trek BBS , today I watched DS9 's ' The Visitor ' again . Just like the first time I saw it , I was deeply moved by the episode , and it made me see again precisely why I love Star Trek so much . ' The Visitor ' had everything a good show should have , and it told its tale in an even more compelling way than TNG 's ' The Inner Light . ' ' The Visitor ' is also one of those rare shows you can show non-Trek fans , and be absolutely certain they 're going to like it . But , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by focusing on its one major strength - characters , instead of action . Really , ' The Visitor ' was the perfect example of how I think Star Trek should be . <p> First up is a news report about the ' Star Trek World Tour , ' which will beam down to Vienna on the 29th of June . The event will last until the 8th of August , giving Austrian Star Trek fans nearly six weeks to be terribly disappointed . More info on this can be found ( in German ) by going here , but if I were you , I 'd just skip the World Tour and use the money to buy a few Star Trek tapes - in Germany it was a major disappointment when I visited , and it probably wo n't be much better in Austria . <p> Secondly , the German Star Trek Index received a letter from television station Sat.1 , telling them about the new Voyager airdates . As you may recall , a few months ago Sat.1 was considering cancelling Voyager altogether because of bad ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show from the Friday to the Saturday . The current plan is to show the two remaining new episodes from the fourth season , then Sat.1 will repeat three older fourth-season episodes , and , starting the 12th of June , they 'll be showing third-season episodes on Saturdays . A detailed schedule can be found by going here . <p> Lastly , a new edition of Radio Trek 's TREKminds show is available . The current edition of this ( German ) internet radio show mostly deals with the aforementioned Sat.1 troubles , including editorial commentaries and a reader phone-in . You can find the current edition of the program by going here . <p> Most Trek fans on-line know that Strange Bedfellows was originally titled Eclipse , and ' Til Death Do Us Part was to have been Umbra . With Penumbra , the three titles would have gone through the stages of an eclipse , and I 'm disappointed they were changed . The Eclipse sequence of titles would have had a much higher C.Q. ( Coolness Quotient ) than the ones they replaced them with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series ' strong suit : my favorite DS9 episode titles probably Rocks and Shoals , and that one by default . <p> It 's nearly been one year to the day since this newsletter started publishing . In that time we 've seen the Behaviour Group come and go , lost members and recieved new ones , and we 've made many new friends . Through all of this TSCN has kept growing .

" On the Nielson ratings ( the top 120 shows on American television ) we are consistently at the 80 - 90 level , so there are a lot of shows doing better than us , but most of them are on a network that is not just starting to get off the ground ... The Next Generation and DS9 were syndicated , which means they were seen by every market in the country . We 're only seen on UPN , which only covers 80% of the market . So it 's hard to get a sense of how many people are really watching . But we 've lasted five years and we 've beaten everybody who was supposed to knock us off the air . I still get wonderful support from German fans , English - all the British fans are wonderful - so it has a world-wide following , unlike many shows on American TV who get better ratings than us .

You probably will want to read the below update anyway , but if you really do not want to hear anything at all about the DS9 finale , just click here to move on to the next update . Backstage Pass , which is rapidly turning out to be a superb Star Trek news source , just posted another update to its DS9 news page , talking about the series wrap parties : <p> Well , it 's all over but for the shouting . There was a small wrap party on Friday for just the cast and crew ( there was a larger wrap party on Thursday night with the press in attendance ) and a lunch last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crew . Michael Dorn , when asked if he was ready for a long vacation , gave an enthusiastic , " Oh God YES ! " <p> The good news is that there may still be a future for Deep Space Nine : <p> One bit of good news - the Defiant sets are being stored for possible future use ( even though the last time we see the Defiant it 's definitely in need of a good paint and body guy ) . <p> A piece of speculation which is purely me doing some wishful thinking : maybe in the final episode of Deep Space Nine they 'll blow up the station , which is the reason the Promenade sets are already being destroyed . As you may recall , Ai n't It Cool News recently reported DS9 's final episode was rather similar to ' Sleeping In Light , ' Babylon 5 's final episode , and in there the station also blows up . Perhaps Paramount still wants there to be a future for the DS9 cast , and maybe that 's the reason why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , this certainly has n't been confirmed anywhere yet - perhaps there wo n't be a future for DS9 at all , but I certainly hope there will be one ! <p> Response from : John Ordover Yes , and because Mike 's schedule was so filled up that he just was n't going to have the time to write the book all on his own . Rather than miss a deadline , he asked if he could bring in a collaborator , and of course we said yes. : ) <p> Ordover also gave a slight hint about the future of the DS9 novel line , which could perhaps even be non-existent after the DS9 finale has aired : <p> Query from : Andrew John:The Rebels trilogy takes place in the fourth season . When you start up the DS9 line again , will you also start writing novels that take place in the 5th 6th &amp; 7th seasons ? Like the REBELS trilogy takes place in the fourth season ?

The four new items include a 1960 's Star Trek lunch box ( or at least that 's what it looks like ) , a Classic Trek U.S.S. Enterprise ornament , and the previously announced Rio Grande model . I 'd give you a direct link to the Star Trek page , but unfortunately Hallmark 's web server does n't allow that .

This is that new site : <p> Star Trek - The Lost CommentaryChristian ( 4:26 pm CST ) As you probably know , the SciFi Channel recently stopped airing the uncut ' Star Trek - Special Edition ' episodes , and reduced Star Trek 's timeslot from 90 to 60 minutes .

So , I will post the scripts for all of the episodes that did n't air to the board . <p> You can find the transcripts by going here and clicking on the episode titles . However , if you want to read this in a more convenient way , the Leonard Nimoy Club put up a special mini-site for the transcripts - you can find that by going here .

This chat will be held at 11:30pm GMT ( 6:30pm EST , 3:30pm PST ) . <p> Last I heard , there was a chance Jeff Holzhauer might show up , so this could turn out to be interesting . <p> As part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on Star Trek ) and John de Lancie ( " Q " on ST:TNG , ST:DS9 , ST:VOY ) will be signing copies of their Alien Voices productions on video and audio tape from 3-5 p.m. this Saturday , April 24 . Look for Nimoy and deLancie , whose radio-style stagings of classic sci-fi have been seen live on the Sci-Fi Channel , at the Border Books booth . <p> We just returned from Interplay 's Star Trek headquarters in lovely Orange County California and we managed to snag a couple of flicks on our way out the door . The first short gives you a quick peek at the company 's upcoming Klingon Academy ( read our preview here ) , a space fighter with some unbelievable graphics . Better still , you 'll finally get a chance to show those smug Federation bastards that sitting in easy chairs talking diplomacy all day is n't the best way to get ready for a fight . <p> Once you 've finished basking in the glow of burning Federation starships you 'll be ready to tackle our next feature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Worlds . In this film you 'll get a good look at how the newest title in the Star Trek line-up actually moves . As always , if you want a big dose of IGNPC 's patented hinkfo , you can check out our preview as well . <p> New Radio Free Decipher BroadcastChristian ( 4:04 pm CST ) The latest edition of Decipher 's ' Radio Free Trek ' show focuses exclusively on ' Blaze of Glory , ' the new Star Trek Customizable Card Game expansion pack . During the show , host Carol Wisely chats with Sandy Wible and Tim Ellington about the new expansio pack , which should appear in about 8 weeks . You can listen to the show by going here . Major thanks go out to Mark P for reporting this ! <p> Suren Seron : Welcome everyone to tonight 's chat ! Guests are starting to arrive right now at the ST:DS9 series final wrap party . As we have a chance to interview them , questions and answers will be posted as soon as they arrive . <p> Alexander Siddig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rene Auberjonois , Ira Steven Behr , Dan Curry , David Stipes , and Karen Westerfields have all arrived . We had some rain earlier , but it seems to have gone away as the stars are arriving . <p> ... <p> Ben : Marc ..... can you tell where you are at in Hollywood ? and can I join you there ? <p> Marc Wade : I do n't think that would be a good idea , Ben . Too many fans here in L.A. might figure out where we are . Let me just say that we are at an elegant hotel with a beautiful bar and patio It is just getting dark here now . Actually quite dark . In spite of the mild weather , there are space heaters set up outside to keep the guests warm . There is plenty of elegant food and drink available . THe arrivals are right outside our window , Terry Farrell is here . <p> Question : What will you miss the most about working on this show ? <p> Terry Farrell : Well , I 've already missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish person ... and I do n't like sharing my worm with just anyone . But I would have to say I will miss sounding so intelligent on a daily basis . And being a great pilot . <p> ... <p> Question : Do you feel that DS9 followed the direction that Gene set for Star Trek ? <p> Majel Barrett Roddenberry : I think they 're entirely different and come out of the minds of two different people . I feel it was done to its capacity very well . Very exciting , and probably not the way Gene would have done it at all . But Viva le difference . I think Rick Berman did a fantastic job . <p> Note that these quite probably are n't the most interesting quotes in the transcript , but I 'm afraid I 'm not really operating at full capacity at the moment . I have to say I find it funny that Marc Wade did n't want to disclose the location of the wrap party , though , considering this was broadcasted to the whole world in a recent press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention , as Marc Wade also said that besides startrek.com , only Daily Variety was present , so I guess we wo n't be hearing too much about this event . <p> You can find the full transcript here , which is also where you 'll be able to find a few pictures of the event ( including the one I put up above , which is , of course , copyrighted by Paramount ) . <p> GamePen Previews Starfleet CommandChristian ( 4:03 pm CST ) Gregg Charlton at GamePen put up a new preview of Interplay 's upcoming strategy game , Starfleet Command . The preview starts with the obligatory paragraph about how all other Star Trek games failed , but then they actually go on to provide some interesting info on the game 's graphics : <p> Graphically , Starfleet Command is just about the best strategy game I 've laid eyes on . The only other game that 's in the same ball park would be Myth . The ships are accurate representations of those that appeared in the TV series while the special effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Kirk era ships . Particle and lighting effects verge on spectacular especially when a shielded ship is hit with a simultaneous barrage of phasers and photon torpedoes . Similarly , background items like space stations , asteroids and planets are also beautifully rendered . Sound effect are equally outstanding as I found myself believing I was watching the show itself . Clearly , Interplay and Quick Silver have spent a great deal of time on the presentation end of the game . <p> This is not to say that the basic game engine has been ignored . Turn radii , relative vessel speeds , firepower , shield strength etc. all feel " right " . By that I mean that the game plays like the epic space battles seen in the series . Frustrated Trekkies who could n't stand controlling a starship with a joystick in Starfleet Academy will find that the combat in Starfleet Command is fought as though space-age battleships are pounding away at one another . Now the Enterprise behaves like the heavy cruiser it is rather than as an X-Wing on growth hormones ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappointingly , does n't contain any screenshots . Still , it 's an interesting read , and Trek strategy fans should probably check it out . Thanks go out to Star Trek Gaming Central for this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 4:02 pm CST ) -Tomorrow at 09:45 CET , German television station Sat.1 will be repeating Voyager 's ' DSmon ' ( Demon ) <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 4:02 pm CST ) Though I have n't actually been able to post at the site myself today , the list of active topics tells me it 's getting more and more popular every day . Take a look at what some of the most interesting discussions are currently dealing with : <p> -This thread was first dealing with a question dealing with Voyager 's return to the Alpha Quadrant , but now mainly deals with Star Trek books .

I really love those happenings , but they sure make one very tired .

Star Trek actually did pretty well , in most categories . Take a look at some of the main Trek highlights : <p> Best SF/Fantasy TV Actor 1 - Avery Brooks 9 - Marc Alaimo " .... a few years ago Brooks would have been a contender for worst actor . But the new , bullying , blustering , vision-driven , bald-driven , ' I 'll wear an apron if I like so want to make something of it ' Captain of DS9 seems to be a development which has given Brooks the chance to show what he 's really capable of . It 's also good to see someone who 's essentially only a bit-parter , Marc Alaimo , doing so well . " <p> The full list also contains the ' Best Actresses ' list with no less than 4 Trek stars , a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media Tie-in Novel ' category , and lots , lots more . Find it all here . <p> Chase MastersonAs the science fiction saga draws to a conclusion , Chase Masterson looks back on her happy years with the Star Trek series as Dabo girl Leeta , considers the character 's rapid development into a key figure on the show , and reveals her own ambitious future projects <p> The actual issue also contains a book review of Voyager 's ' Death of a Neutron Star , ' the latest TNG , DS9 and Voyager videos , and news of the season finales for both current Trek series . The issue is on sale now in the UK for a price of 2.99 UKP , $6.95 . Thanks go out to DreamWatch 's assistant editor Rod Edgar for posting this to the alt.tv.star-trek.voyager newsgroup . <p> Trek Toy NewsChristian ( 1:38 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac just updated again , providing us with lots of new action figure info . First of all , the Toy Maniac is reporting there probably wo n't be a 6 " Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven of Nine , previously scheduled as a Diamond Comics Exclusive for March , has been put on hold , with no forseeable release date at this time . <p> Fortunately , that is about the only bad news to be found at the Toy Maniac , as the site is also reporting about several action figure price drops : <p> With Playmates ' mail order Latinum Gallery program apparently a failure , the remaining stock has been sold off to Diamond Comics and other small retailers who order directly from Playmates . The 12 " Captain Kirk from " Where No Man Has Gone Before " and the 12 " Seven of Nine statues are being solicited in the March issue of Previews . You may also be able to shop around for lower prices from other mail order dealers . <p> On top of that comes the news that Target has drastically lowered the prices of most of its 9 " exclusives , which can now be found for as low as $16.70 .

' In the BotF preview , producer Jeff Holzhauer provides us with some very interesting info on how the various races will play : <p> The race you choose to lead affects how you should act when you encounter other races , and the computer AI will play the other races appropriately . " If you 're not playing the Klingons , " said Holzhauer , " you know that there 's gon na be a day when they will declare war on you at the drop of a hat . <p> " As for you playing the races , " he continues , " you 'll see big differences ( between them ) . " When you play the Federation , for example , people will be very , very unhappy when you go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it , so you can invade Vulcan and set up a military government there , but you 'll take a morale hit on all your worlds because the Federation does n't like to act that way . " <p> The Starfleet Command preview focuses more on how the missions will play out : <p> As you work your way up through the ranks , the game gradually departs from the Dynaverse engine into a much deeper level of intrigue--scripted by none other than Scott Bennie , made famous for his design work on the incredible Star Trek : Judgement Rites ! <p> Between the Scott Bennie missions and the Dynaverse missions , Starfleet Command offers an impressive range of gameplay . While Starfleet Command focuses on the militaristic aspects of being a starship captain , there 's a taste of the classic , moralistic Trek lurking within . " On the Dynaverse missions , " says Bethke , " the player builds up his military career , and then on the ( later ) missions , that 's where he has some significant choices to make as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautions , Starfleet Command " is not an adventure game . You 're going to have to show you 're military skills . " <p> In case you 're interested in hearing more , the ' Birth of the Federation ' preview can be found here , while the ' Starfleet Command ' preview can be found here . Thanks go out to Serfer at the Trekweb Bulletin Board for pointing me to this . <p> TrekWeb Announces Voyager Writer ChatChristian ( 1:20 pm CST ) Steve Krutzler at TrekWeb just announced a new upcoming chat with Voyager writers Bryan Fuller and Michael Taylor . The chat will take place on the 4th of May at 6:00pm PDT , and hopefully they 'll be able to provide us with some extra info on the reported Voyager writer shake-up . If you wish to ask them about that , you can already do so now , as advance questions are currently being accepted . More info on this can be found by going here . <p> Meanwhile , some more info on the possible writer transfer has appeared on WebTrek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from for this update ) : <p> Not true about Ron Moore at least - he 's said it is n't . Have to ask about the others . About Kenneth Biller 's departure he said , Du n no about that - I 've been away on vacation for a couple of weeks , remember . But since he has previously been retired from producer to story editor , it perhaps would n't be surprising . <p> Thanks go out to insider Dangermouse for actually posting this to Usenet in the first place , and to Leonard Schuurmans for pointing me to this . <p> Again , ' Equinox , ' the last Voyager episode of this season , is heavily spoiled in this update . Click here to avoid these spoilers . <p> The Star Trek Universe just received some interesting information from a new source on the Voyager finale : <p> The evil doctor IS in the show , contrary to what was said to be ..... The evil doc knocks off the good doc , takes the mobile emitter , and uses it to spring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the ep , the Equinox steals a security grid generator from Voyager ( leaving them defenseless from the alien fissures ) and takes off . Seven is unconscious on the Equinox and there is a possibility that the evil doc has remained on Voyager ... <p> The original rumor said that they would make another B plot , because the old one looked to much like the previous episode . My source has seen the episode with the old B plot in it . <p> A few days ago it became known that reshoots were currently taking place for the DS9 finale , in which the doctor 's B-plot would be replaced by a Tom Paris plot . Apparently , the Universe 's source saw the episode with the old B-plot in it yesterday , so that would seem to indicate the old story is still in . More can be found in the full report . <p> Thanks go out to Michael at the Star Trek Universe for this , but do please remember that this info , too , should be seen as a rumour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , you want to hear more about this you should probably also check out this thread at the Trek BBS , which deals with precisely this . <p> This episode rocked , and I 'll tell you why . It 's all about Kai Winn . In the span of an hour , she goes from being an easily manipulated pawn to a sobbing lost soul begging for salvation to flat out pissed . Louise Fletcher makes these transitions completely believable , and the levels of complexity and ambiguity that she and the writers have brought to this role are really quite amazing . She even gets a total " Melrose " moment when she slaps Dukat . Go girl . <p> With five stars out of five , it is made very clear what Kuhn thought about the episode . Find her complete review here . <p> A Blaze Of GloryChristian ( 12:57 pm CST ) Decipher , the company producing the Star Trek Customizable Card Game , just put up a Q&amp;A with Bill Martinson , Sandy Wible and Tim Ellington , the creators of the upcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are n't able to provide us with a release date , they do give us the lowdown on what the pack will contain : <p> Q : What are the gameplay innovations Star Trek CCG players should be on the lookout for ? Sandy : A new battle-related side deck , enhanced capturing rules and cards , theme cards for the Jem'Hadar and infiltrators , and plenty of battle-related cards . <p> In the full review they go on to talk about how this expansion pack will affect the earlier ones , and about the special battle-related cards they 're putting in . Find it all here . <p> Most of the sets are still intact .. but the Defiant is slowly starting to get taken down . There was the Klingon Warbird set there also .. but 's it also been taken down . Stage 18 was extremely cramped . <p> Unfortunately , what is going to happen to the sets makes me even more sad : <p> I talked to one of the people involved in the production while they were scrapping the deflector dish from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished by this and mentioned it to this individual . He noted to me that there were so many complications in trying to do something decent with it ( and I do n't have the time to go into detail ) that it just was n't worth it . It would have been cost prohibitive just to get an agreement to do something decent with it and then cut it into pieces . <p> Remember there are just so many unions in the studio that that kind of thing gets very VERY complicated and the unions are as shiity about that kind of thing as Viacom can be .. the fans are perpetually the loosers . Let me put it another way ... someone from the studio sent a small piece of some broken plastic to a convention to be actioned off for charity .... he was then met by several VP 's that explained to him that next time it happened his rear end would be out the door in no time . <p> This really is such a terrible waste - why did n't Viacom invest some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ? Surely they would have been a great added attraction at , for instance , the ' Star Trek Experience ? ' Someone should have thought of a ' Save the Sets ' campaign several months ago - hell , *I* should have thought of that . It truly feels like a loss to hear that their being taken down in this way . <p> In any case , if you really , really want to read more about this , click here . Also , if you want to talk about this , a thread has been created at the Trek BBS dealing with this - you can find it by going here . <p> CGO Previews ' DS9 - The Fallen'Christian ( 12:56 pm CST ) The absolutely wonderful Computer Games Online just put up the very first preview ever of ' Deep Space Nine - The Fallen , ' the game previously known as ' Millennium . ' The preview is certainly interesting , as it mentions , together with a few other things , that a sequel has already been decided upon and will arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *this* game is also available : <p> In the game , you 'll play one of three Deep Space 9 characters : Sisko , Worf , or Kira . Hare and Gordon both make pains to point out that these are n't just different skins used to play through the same exact mission , but are fully realized characters which will offer a different version of the story and gameplay when you play them through . The game is played out across 12 missions , although perhaps " chapters " is a better term , as Hare says these are really , really large gameplay areas , with muliple objectives per area . <p> You 'll move from mission area to mission area in a linear fashion ( Hare says , " As much as it 's an attractive idea sometimes to think of nonlinearity , it really is kind of a bitch when it comes to story telling " ) , but activities within each mission area are n't necessarily linear . Many of the missions will be duplicative in the sense that each of the three characters will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed and actions done will be different for each character . At times all three might meet during a mission and a non-interactive sequence will ensue , but beyond that characters ' actions ( and your gameplay ) will be different . Additionally , each character will have three of his or her own mini-missions he or she might go on . <p> The preview goes on to talk about the game 's graphics , and then provides us with some info about something that could very well turn out to be the main selling point of the game : <p> In a final Trek touch , and one that may be a nice diversion for non-Trekkers tired of normal between mission text or video briefings , when you 're not on a mission you 'll get to wander about the virtual station , visiting locales and talking with characters from the show . While never necessary for gameplay , in some cases this will give you information about the story or upcoming missions that may be helpful , and in others it 'll be sightseeing for the Trek fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all visiting this station way out in deep space , right ? <p> Lots more can be found in the full preview - it 's really very interesting ! Thanks go out to David Henderson , Blue , Jim Wethy , Evil Avatar and Star Trek Gaming Central for pointing me to this , in that order . I guess everyone is really looking forward to the game - I 've never ever had so many sources pointing to this ! <p> Insurrection Nominated For Hugo AwardChristian ( 12:56 pm CST ) A new report at Sci-Fi Wire lists the nominees for this year 's Hugo awards , which will be voted upon by the members of the World Science Fiction Society . ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' is listed as one of the nominees for Best Dramatic Presentation : <p> It 's a pity none of the episodes from the television series have been nominated , but still , hopefully ' Insurrection ' will win . I would have hoped they would Another slightly Trek-related nominee is Kristine Kathryn Rusch , whose novelette ' Echea ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurrection On US Airways ' FlightsChristian ( 12:55 pm CST ) A press release from airline company ' US Airways ' is saying that , as of now , passengers on their transatlantic flights will be able to see ' Insurrection , ' the ninth Star Trek feature , starring ' Patrick Stewart and LeVar Burton . ' I wonder who thought of that cast list : - ) ? The full press release can be found here . <p> Eon Reviews ' Spectre'Christian ( 12:54 pm CST ) The latest edition of Eon Magazine contains a review of the pocket book edition of ' Spectre , ' last year 's William Shatner novel . Precisely why they did n't choose to review his new ' Dark Victory ' instead is beyond me - I guess they must have some financial difficulties and could n't affor the hardcover , or something like that ; - ) . In any case , the reviewer rather liked the novel : <p> big draw is the mystery of Kirk 's double , " Tiberius , " emperor of the mirror universe . Tiberius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECTRE , leaving a sizzling cliff-hanger lead-in to the next novel , DARK VICTORY . SPECTRE is a fast read , perhaps less satisfying than the earlier THE RETURN , but benefiting greatly from Shatner 's intimate knowledge of his hero . While the past decade 's STAR TREK novels have largely been antiseptic and lacking in depth of character , Shatner and the Reeves-Stevens duo have seemingly been given the freedom to write in a more adult style by Pocket Books ' editors . More power to them . <p> More can be found in the full review , where the book receives a B- . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for pointing me to this . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 12:53 pm CST ) The Trek BBS now has more than 70 registered members , and many more unregistered members , making it one of the most popular Trek forums on the net ! Of course , that also means lots of interesting discussions are developing at the BBS . Take a look at a few of the topics that are currently being discussed : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this thread , the merits of the series are being discussed . <p> -The original spoilers for the Voyager season finale mentioned that the episode would feature Species 8472 . Now , it seems they have been left out of the episode . What do you think about this ? <p> -Most reviewers seem to think that ' Strange Bedfellows ' is one of the greatest DS9 episodes ever produced . Do you also think so ? Here 's your chance to let the world know what you think ! <p> Ten more topics are currently being talked about , but , of course , you 're more than welcome to add your topics to that ! Head on over to the Trek BBS to meet your fellow fans - remember , you do n't even need to register to post ! We 're looking forward to hearing from you ! <p> New at TrekSeek.comChristian ( 12:52 pm CST ) Well , it was a very quiet day at TrekSeek yesterday , with just two site submissions . Still , we 're up to 1009 sites , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one of those two sites : <p> -The Borg Collective is the online source for all that is Borg , plus extensive information , multimedia and more for all the Star Trek series and feature films . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 12:52 pm CST ) As I 'll be away for most of the day tomorrow , and probably wo n't be returning until late in the evening , tomorrow 's TrekToday update will also arrive somewhat later than usual . Tomorrow 's update will probably be appearing about 4 hours later than usual , at 22:00 CET / 3:00pm CST . Sorry ! <p> Voyager did better than last week , but not as good as expected . Voyager got a 3.4/5 for the 9pm hour , that 's up 0.6 from last week . Voyager was 6th for the hour behind " Charmed " that got a 4.0/6. 7 Days that aire a new episode at 8 pm did not do well , it got a 2.6/4 that was only up 0.3 from last weeks rerun . Expect a final rating for Voyager around 2.8 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) rating for " Strange Bedfellows " is currently 9.4 , the highest rating for the season , and third highest for DS9 overall behind " In the Pale Moonlight " and " Duet " ) . The rating usually decreases a little as more people vote throughout the week and over the weekend , but this is still a very strong position so far . <p> The exact fan ratings can be found by going here , from where you 'll also be able to vote . Thanks go out to David Henderson for reporting this . <p> Is Sky Dumping Star Trek ? Christian ( 1:20 pm CST ) A few days ago we reported that British television station Sky One may be dumping Star Trek in summer , in order to give the franchise a one-year break . Yesterday , Paul Weaver forwarded me a mail he received a few days ago , which dealt with exactly this : <p> What you may not yet be aware of is that Viacom , the Jekyll and Hyde of US TV , has decided to launch an SF channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have started pulling all the licenses for their shows , including Trek . <p> It may well be the case that Sky has just lost some of its rerun rights to TNG , as have many US TV stations . Indeed , many stations here have even had DS9 SEASON 7 itself pulled out from under them , and a lot of US fans are disenfranchised because of it . Those of us who still have it are copying episodes as fast as they can be run off and bouncing them around all over the US . <p> Considering that Sky is not a US channel , Sky currently is n't even showing TNG , and Sky apparently has three rerun rights for every Trek series it owns , I 'm not sure how reliable this is . Furthermore , the letter ended with the following passage , so quite probably the only reason behind it was just to sell more episodes : <p> If you want episodes direct from us ( DS9 is only 5 episodes from the finale at the moment , so we already have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . We DO N'T charge for episodes . We consider that to be unethical , both from the viewpoint of copyright legality and because we believe that fans should help each other . All you would need to pay for is the cost of tapes and postage . <p> Even when this probably has n't any impact on the United Kingdom , it 's still interesting to hear that Viacom is pulling all the Trek licenses for their own SF channel . Perhaps this means Viacom really *is* serious about it . In any case , thanks go out to Paul Weaver for forwarding this mail to me . <p> The first AUDIO Sev Trek ! ! ! This week , we 're experimenting with a different format . The voices of Quirk and Spook have been supplied by the very talented Wally Fields . You write Quirk 's response and Wally will add the winning punchline to the audio file at the end of the week . <p> ... <p> I 'm not sure where we 're going with this - we might combine the audio with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to go about doing that . If anyone with the software/skills to do web animations wants to volunteer their help , please email me ! <p> Please email him , indeed , as a Sev Trek animated cartoon would no doubt be absolutely amazing ! More info on the cartoon can be found by going here , which is also where you 'll be able to find a text version of the cartoon and submit your own punchlines . <p> In other Sev Trek news , as of today you will be able to create your very own Enterforaprize : <p> Firstly , you can download a FREE electronic paper model of the Enterforaprize , complete with pizza saucer section , cigarette nacelles and beer can engineering section ! The paper model was designed by Erwin de Jong and definitely worth looking at . You can also buy the Enterforaprize D paper model . <p> The Enterforaprize model can be found here , while the Enterforaprize-D can be found here . They 're pretty cool , and they were designed by a fellow Dutchman , so I suggest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Counterpoint " did surprisingly well , staying flat from last week 's 2.6 rating , ranking 101st . That 's right about on the season average for reruns and well below last year 's firstrun episode that aired this week , " Unforgettable . " <p> ... <p> All in all , Voyager has survived its weakest stint of reruns this year fairly unscathed . Both only dipped slightly below the previous season average of 2.7 despite scoring well below the season average in their firstrun attempts . Next week should come back up with a stronger rerun . <p> DS9 's ratings , although not stellar , still showed some promise : <p> " Once More Unto the Breach " performed slightly above expectations , taking a 3.6 rating , ranking 25th . Although below average for the season , that is slightly up from the last two weeks of reruns . It is , however , down quite a bit from last year 's " You Are Cordially Invited . " <p> ... <p> This performance is heartening as there is some improvement , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should improve on this slightly as well , leading into DS9 's final stretch . This episode did not perform well compared to the rest of this season , but week-to-week improvement is always a good thing to see . <p> This was a transition episode and felt like one , though it had some truly classic moments - Demar howling in amusement when Worf killed Weyoun , Julian realizing he 's in love with Ezri as opposed to Dax , Winn pulling a Trek V Kirk and discovering her own ego is too big to share the universe with any gods . The Worf/Dax storyline dragged somewhat but I liked its resolution these two were NOT meant to be together , but it was much more satisfying to have them find that out through trial and error than it have been had they never made the effort . <p> I have gotten a real kick out of Ezri 's confirmation of Jadzia 's promiscuity , hinted at but never made explicit during the previous six years ; it 's nice to know that , Voyager 's female crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy it and do n't have any problem fulfilling their professional duties . I was not a big fan of either Ezri or Worf prior to this mini-arc , but they 've both done a superb job owning up to their shortcomings and attempting to move past them . I 'm just sorry they did n't do it when there was more time left in the series for us to enjoy them . <p> A full synopsis and a detailed analysis can , of course , be found in the full review . <p> Juggernaut Press ReleaseChristian ( 12:34 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains major spoilers for this Monday 's new Voyager episode , ' Juggernaut . ' In case you want to avoid being spoiled , click here to move on to the next post . <p> AGAIN , below you can find a synopsis of the upcoming ' Juggernaut ' episode . Click here to avoid them . <p> David Henderson at Psi Phi just put up the official press release for Voyager 's ' Juggernaut . ' As usual , the press release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S.S. Voyager rescues two crewmen from an abandoned , out-of-control Malon freighter that 's about to unleash a theta radiation blast into the sector . Soon , Lieutenant Torres leads an away team to board the freighter and contain the poison--despite warnings from its crewman , Fesek and Pelk , about the Angel of Decay that wreaks havoc aboard the cargo ship . <p> A lot more ( including info on the guest cast ) can be found by going here . <p> QuakeCity Interviews Rob GeeChristian ( 12:33 pm CST ) The absolutely wonderful people at QuakeCity just put up an interview with Rob Gee , one of the artists currently working on the Voyager game at Raven . In the interview , we get to hear more about the game than ever before , including some new information on the atmosphere of the game : <p> Since I ca n't discuss game play issues at this time ( again , wait till E3 ) I 'll focus on what I can talk about that will separate our game from the rest of the pack : authenticity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to this game 's signature . It will be our first Star Trek title out of the gates so you know we 're going to make it shine . Our designers are working hard on creating the most exact virtual duplicate of Voyager 's layout possible . We 're using photos , illustrations and blueprints for the many different locales seen in the Voyager episodes . Many of our current screenshots have been mistaken for scanned reference photos by other Ravenites . <p> I 'm sure Star Trek fans will be very satisfied with the amount of quality art and detailed design they 'll find aboard our Voyager . Rest assured , there will be many various locales other than the Voyager to explore the majority of which will be extremely dangerous and challenging . I 'm sure gamers , hardcore and casual alike , will find this game extremely enjoyable to play and find appreciation for the finer points of game design we 're achieving on this title . <p> In short , this episode is a great continuation and growth on the last two . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see the Dominion Breen plan brought to fruition , we get ( finally ) some resolution to the Ezri/Worf angle , and we get what will surely be Damar 's redemtion arc begin . It did NOT feel forced or unnatural ... the story developed with emotion and power . But it does n't end here ... the momentum is clearly driving the story on ... I want to see just what the specifics of Dukat and Winn 's unholy alliance , these strange bedfellows , will bring about--who and how those that stand in their way will fall brushed away like dry leaves in a powerful Winn ( wind ! ) . I want to see just what this newly reinvigorated Dominion/Breen alliance will have-- " you must understand , of course , that we all serve the founders : Vorta , Jem'Hadar , Cardassians , and Breen . " I want to see Damar lead his people away from doom . The prophets vs. the Pagh wraiths . Sisko 's sorrows . In short , I want to see more--and I think that is what a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party Chat TodayChristian ( 12:04 pm CST ) As a reminder , the Star Trek Continuum will be hosting a live chat at the DS9 wrap party . Most cast members will be attending , plus several of the show 's creators . Advance questions can currently be submitted here , while instructions on how to participate can be found here . <p> Well , we 're going to be showing Soldier of Fortune and Star Trek : Voyager at the Activision booth this year and we 're really excited about it . I think a lot of people are going to be shocked by what they see from both games . Unveiling them for the world to see is going to be a blast . <p> In addition , he also talks about the infamous Raven . plan files , which regular users of our TrekFinger service already know about : <p> The personal attacks in our . plan files are all meant in good fun . Bob Love and I like to take shots at each other and recently MRJ , Bobby and Rob have jumped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I assure them that we 're just joking around .

It may have cost a little more , but at least it would 've guaranteed an audience . The latest in the network 's lamentable Thursday-night film series is a tedious , unfocused , secular version of those old religious movies which provided unconvincing re-enactments of teen life while attempting to warn young viewers of the dire consequences of their benignly evil ways . <p> Jonathan Frakes of Star Trek : The Next Generation ' ' does some serious slumming here , playing a guardian angel who basically pops up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of teenagers with a kind of beatific dismay . His role here is n't even explained until about 45 minutes into the film , when freshly scrubbed aspiring marine biologist Rachel ( Hayley DuMond ) dies . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 12:03 pm CST ) -In the US , UPN will be showing the new television film ' Dying To Live ' at 8:00pm . The movie stars Jonathan Frakes as a ' guardian angel , ' and was also co-produced by him . <p> -According to TV Quest , Marc Alaimo ( Gul Dukat ) will be guest-starring on tonight 's episode of " Diagnosis : Murder " on CBS in the US . The episode also airs at 8:00pm , so you 're going to have to choose between Riker and Dukat . Thanks go out to Psi Phi'sDavid Henderson for this . <p> -Today at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the third-season episode ' The Cloud Minders , ' again not one of those episodes you 'd really want to watch . <p> -In the UK , Sky One will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at 23:30 GMT .

Take a look at some of the discussions that are currently taking place : <p> -Do you live in Australia ? Are you a Star Trek fan ? Well , strange as it may sound , you 're not alone ! Take a look at this thread to talk to some fellow Australians ! <p> -With some very interesting posts today , the New Series thread is still going strong .

According to the TrekWeb reports , DS9 writers Ron Moore and Rene Echevarria will be moving over to Voyager , a move which Brannon Braga later seemed to comfirm . The Daily Sci-Fi has some ideas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also leads to some interesting speculations about next season 's Trek prospects . It seems that Paramount and possibly Rick Berman seems more interested in consolidating what 's good out of the Star Trek universe rather than diluting the mix with a new Star Trek series , at least for this season . With a new team and some strong veterans , it 's possible to improve Voyager to the point where it could become more than filler for UPN 's Wednesday 9-10 slot , and if its ratings improve , could set the stage for a possible new series in late 2000-2001 . But we 'll wait until we see what these guys can do with these characters first before speculating . <p> Really , some pretty detailed spoilers about ' 11:59 ' can be found in this update . Click here to move on to the next update and avoid these spoilers . <p> Yesterday , we reprinted the following information from this report at the Daily Buzz : <p> In " 11:59 , " Kate Mulgrew plays an ancestor of Captain Kathryn Janeway who helped build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's Eve 1999 as another of Janeway 's ancestors resists the creation of a massive Millennium Gate , a model for the first colony on Mars . <p> The ancestor 's name is Shannon O'Donnel . She is a cousin who is 15 times ( or something like that ) removed . She supposedly was this big scientist who worked on all the Mars projects , but we find out she was a nobody , who did nothing except marry a guy twice her age who was afraid of the real world , lived in book store , and who should 've been left there . <p> A thread dealing with this topic is still available at the Trek BBS - you can find it here . <p> Jeff Holzhauer Interview OnlineChristian ( 12:59 pm CST ) The Trek Gaming Alliance just put up an interview with Jeff Holzhauer , the man behind Microprose 's upcoming turn-based strategy game ' Birth of the Federation .

( i.e. did you leave it open so that people could hack into the game ? ) Jeff : Hacking the game files is not going to be easy . But it is possible with some time and effort . <p> TDawg : In your opinion , what makes BotF so great ? Jeff : Well , the thing that makes it so great in my mind is the whole Star Trek thing . And also the Minor Races . The minor races throw in so many variables into it , it makes it interesting . Also I like the look and feel of it , as well as the balance . <p> TDawg : Exactly , what does " Ruthlessly Efficient " mean ? Jeff : Well , it means that Cardiassian 's get a few more structures . Like for Sub-Races , you can build a War Camp on their planets to give you extra industry . Basically like Bajor , and yes , you can get kicked off the planet by a revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American release date has now been set to the 25th of May - find this and a lot more by going here . <p> This issue has a heavy dose of NewsBits : with an inordinate number of independent films and game previews .

With the way your schedules are constantly getting shifted , it 's a wonder those of you in the UK can find *anything* . Luckily , David stays on top of things , so we 've got that covered , at least on the Trek front . <p> We 've also got a larger-than-usual set of letters , with both information and opinion ( including the one I referred to last issue , but neglected to include ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest album from S.P.O.C.K. from their number one fan : Anders Krampell .

Click here to move on to the next article . <p> I just noticed Backstage Pass ( who also recently reported on the Voyager hacking ) just put up new info on DS9 's Final Chapter . First up is a confirmation of what was already suspected for a long time - the Klingon Empire will soon need to start looking for a new Chancellor : <p> Forget the rumors - Gowron definitely buys the farm . In a press release sent out to the stations running the series , Paramount confirms his death after he double crosses Martok . Look for Worf to do the deed ( I do n't count that as a spoiler because anyone who 's been watching the series knows that Worf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Secondly , Backstage Pass received a report dealing with the ' Weekend at the Promenade ' meeting , at which some interesting new tidbits were overheard : <p> The Enquirer " spoiler " piece is way off the mark . Take anything you 've read there with a huge grain of salt . <p> There is still about a week 's worth of shooting left on the finale but the Promenade has already been torn down . The finality of things is begining to set in . <p> During Andrew ( Garak ) Robinson 's recent guest spot on the " X-Files " , he discovered that David Duchovny was quite fan . Duchovny supposedly kept quoting dialogue from movies that Robinson had been in that even he 'd forgotten ! <p> A charity auction was held during the convention . Some of the notable items sold : The 7th Season " Defiant " construction plaque ( which says " Assimilate This ! " ) went for $1,200 and a " House of Martok " lapel pin sold for $450.00 <p> The report also has some confirmations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night Tremors ' to ' Extreme Measures ' and the Gul Dukat fall .

You can find the preview by going here . <p> Unfortunately , as I write this Vidiot 's site is down , so if you really want to see the trailer I suggest you check out Star Trek Interactive ! , where the trailer can also be found . It 's a very interesting one , so I do recommend actually downloading it . <p> There 's Kai Winn , slithering about as usual , all nicey-nice platitudes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unavailable , " she notes , upon learning that Sisko has asked someone else to perform his wedding ceremony . " But since I 'm here , I think you 'll agree it would be more appropriate for me to do it . " Uh , no . <p> I know Winn 's become a bit more sympathetic over the years , and that makes her all the more interesting . I , however , have a hard time feeling at all bad for her -- even as she is duped by an ever-wiley Dukat -- since she was partially responsible for the death of one of my favorite characters ever , Vedek Bareil . But that 's another rant . <p> Of course , Kuhn also thought the return of Dukat to be very interesting - read more in the full review , where she awards the episode 4 out of 5 stars . <p> Cinescape Online contributor Michael Marek recently had the opportunity to catch the next episode of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , " Strange Bedfellows " .

It 's absolutely hilarious - it had me rolling on the floor when I first found it ! <p> Tuesday April 20 , 1999 <p> ' Night Tremors ' Title ChangesChristian ( 1:20 pm CST ) I do n't know precisely where this info came from , but several web sites ( including WebTrek and Warp Eleven ) are reporting that the title for the 7th Final Chapter episode has changed . The episode , which deals with Bashir/O'Brien and Section 31 , used to be called ' Night Tremors , ' but is now apparently called ' Extreme Measures . ' <p> Update : Timothy Verheecke , webmaster of WebTrek , just sent me a mail informing that the title change was first reported at Psi Phi . After taking a look , I noticed it was already reported there on the 15th of April - 5 days ago ! I bow my head in shame . <p> Robert Duncan McNeill NewsChristian ( 1:17 pm CST ) Thanks to Becky , about a week ago , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guest starring on an episode of ' Early Edition .

' Click here to move on to the next post . <p> Again , some new ' What You Leave Behind ' info is contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coordinator of the Official Marc Alaimo Fan Club , sent me another mail about the Marc Alaimo nose issue . As you may recall , a few days ago he was accidentally punched in the nose by Avery Brooks , and had to be taken to ER : <p> Apparently Marc was in full Cardassian make-up when he got hit ! Dukat goes away for awhile sometime during the episode and comes back as himself and fights Sisko . They rushed him to the ER in full make-up , too ! <p> One of the OMAFC members , Janet Ervin , somehow managaed to be at the DS9 wrap party and spoke with Andy Robinson . Andy saw the hit and said that Marc really bled . There " was blood everywhere ! " ( Which is not surprising . Some areas of the head and face bleed like a facet when cut . Simply because the veins are so close the surface of the skin . ) <p> As Holly Kim also said , can you imagine the looks of the nurses and doctors when faced with a bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certainly a Bajoran nose is nothing compared to full Cardassian make-up . <p> In any case , this does tell us that Dukat will be turned into a Cardassian again before or during the DS9 finale , just in time for the last fight with Sisko . Just like yesterday , major thanks go out to Holly Kim Wilson , who can not be thanked enough for continuing to bring us the latest reports on this ! <p> Yesterday 's Trek BBS topic dealing with exactly this is still available , in case you want to let the world know what you think about this . <p> Just back from their triumphant Brazilian tour , Neil Norman and His Cosmic Orchestra will bring their unique Sci-Fi sound to the Creation Annual Grand Slam Convention in Pasadena , California on April 23 - 25 .

He also told us that Garrett claims he ca n't sing and will be acting as the master of ceremonies ! <p> Birth of the Federation Not GoldChristian ( 11:26 am CST ) The Trek Gaming Alliance is reporting that Microprose 's upcoming Trek game ' Birth of the Federation ' did not actually go gold on the 15th of April , as Microprose originally assured everyone it would . Take a look at what project leader Jeff Holzhauer had to say : <p> We are still doing the localizations and fixing some multiplayer problems and Paramount issues . <p> Even though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game 's release date - just a few weeks ago Holzhauer said that , after the game would be finished , they 'd still have to wait several weeks for the marketing people to begin their advertising campaigns . Now they should just be able to finish the actual game during the first stages of the advertising campaign . <p> Shatner Taping CNBC InterviewChristian ( 11:25 am CST ) The William Shatner Connection is reporting that William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) will be taping an interview for CNBC 's ' In Profile ' series . The show he 's taping for will focus especially on Star Trek , so presumably some other actors are being interviewed as well for this . Info on when the show actually airs will be posted here as soon as I hear about it . <p> The key word , I think , in these early " Final Chapter " episodes is " suspense " --a suspense whose momentum builds slowly and steadily , like an accelerating freight train . The payoff is being deferred , but we sense that payoff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Til Death Do Us Part " is a lot like its predecessor , " Penumbra , " in that it establishes the groundwork for a lot of what 's yet to come . It leaves us dangling on the edge , thirsting for more . <p> On that level , for that purpose , this episode is effective . But , again , it 's somewhat difficult to analyze a story that 's based almost completely on setup--especially considering there 's at least four plot lines running concurrently through the episode . I 'll say this : We 're definitely getting somewhere . Or everywhere . I 'd probably also say " ' Til Death " had me more wrapped up in the overall story than " Penumbra " did--now that I know what to expect in terms of plotting structure . They both have their shining moments as well as weaknesses , but overall I got a sense that " ' Til Death " was a little more cohesive . <p> In the end , he awards the episode 3 out of 4 stars - find a detailed analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:24 am CST ) Decipher , the creators of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game , have announced an update to the official Trek CCG rules . These rules especially have a huge impact on how ' stopped ' cards work , and therefore Decipher put up an article written by Kathy McCracken looking at precisely this : <p> Since the beginning , Star Trek CCG has included the basic concept of cards becoming " stopped " by participating in battle or failing to overcome dilemmas . Stopped cards were prohibited from performing any further actions , such as moving , attempting missions or initiating battle , for the remainder of the turn . More recently , this was clarified to state that stopped cards could not contribute any skills or traits for any purpose . <p> This rule has raised concerns over a number of cards with important end-of-turn effects that may be enabled or modified by a personnel 's skills or traits . For example , stopping a ship 's crew with a well-timed Rogue Borg battle prevents them from " using " their Navigation skills to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Countermeasure Drone who is stopped by a dilemma ca n't download , at the end of your turn , the Adapt : Negate Obstruction needed to pass the dilemma next turn . And of course , a stopped Vorta could not ( until last month 's interim ruling ) ration Ketracel-White , forcing the premature countdown of all your Ketracel-White cards . <p> More can be found in the full article - I hope you will actually understand it , unlike me . <p> AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz is reporting that Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) will promote the ' Mars Milennium Project ' in a public service announcement airing on Wednesday , May 5 , which is also when Voyager 's ' 11:59 ' will air . <p> " I had the idea to do the PSA because of the striking connection between this important educational challenge for kids and one of our upcoming Voyager episodes , " said Picardo .

Besides info on this project , the news item also contains pretty detailed new spoilers for ' 11:59 ' itself : <p> The announcement was filmed on the last shooting day for this Voyager season . In the May 5th episode , " 11:59 , " Kate Mulgrew plays an ancestor of Captain Kathryn Janeway who helped build the Millennium Gate on Earth . The episode is set on New Year 's Eve 1999 as another of Janeway 's ancestors resists the creation of a massive Millennium Gate , a model for the first colony on Mars . <p> Read more about this in the full report at the Daily Buzz . Also , a special thread has been created at the Trek BBS where you can discuss this news - you can find it here . <p> Birth of the Federation has a large number of play options . Besides picking the starting technology levels of the five possible races ( Human , Klingon , Ferengi , Cardassian , and Romulan ) , you pick the size and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty level , and victory conditions . For this game I started at the lowest technology for all races , chose normal difficulty and a small elliptical galaxy , and set domination as the victory condition ( in domination you must attempt to control most of the galaxy ) . <p> The Klingons are poor diplomats and spies but they are great at combat . Their motto is : " If we do not have enemies to fight then we will fight our friends ! " Not as friendly as tribbles but at least you know where you stand with the Klingons . Since the Klingon advantage is in war I will emphasize a large fleet and high technology in weapons , propulsion , energy and construction . I 'll have to minimize biotech and make computer research somewhere in the middle . I 'll attempt to expand rapidly until I contact the other races , consolidate my power , and then eliminate the others one by one . <p> Berger then describes the next 200 turns of gameplay , so it 's definitely worth checking out if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> Voyager Effects CommotionChristian ( 11:19 am CST ) A company press release from ' Puffin Designs ' mentions that they 'll soon be releasing their visual effects program ' Commotion ' for Windows NT . Once the program has shipped , it will also be used on ' Star Trek : Voyager , ' according to this quote : <p> Ever since I first heard about Commotion , I 've been waiting for it to come out for NT . There are so many NT-based post houses with the rising popularity of NT as a predominant 3D platform , and there is a great need for a complimentary paint &amp; effects application like Commotion . We work on demanding visual effects shots for shows like ' Star Trek Voyager ' and Commotion on NT will be an integral part of our production pipeline , ' ' commented Sherry Hitch , Visual Effects Compositing Supervisor , Foundation Imaging . <p> Happy Birthday George Takei !

In a surprise move , the article suddenly decides the Sci-Fi Channel 's Star Trek page is one of the two official Star Trek sites : <p> Although Trek 's official master home is over at Paramount 's Star Trek Continuum site , The Sci-Fi Channel has a comprehensive , dedicated section ( www.scifi.com/startrek ) just for the original series , which began airing last year on the network in specially cut and remastered editions . The aesthetically designed site aims for consistency , using the episode , biographical , and character data from the Continuum site ; for added synergy , there 's a link to the Continuum site from the main page . Also on the main page is quick-link to the next episode scheduled to be aired , which gives most visitors a chance to still run and set the VCR if need be . Interviews with original cast members is a component of the Sci-Fi Channel Special Edition airings of Trek , and accordingly , you can download the most recently aired interviews as QuickTime movies . B+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Perenson saw the web site as it was before the Sci-Fi Channel decided to stop airing the Special Edition episodes ... In any case , if you 'd also like to read a review of the Star Trek Continuum , the ' real ' official site , check out the full article . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for pointing me to this . <p> This week , Star Trek had an extremely bad time ... on BBC2 , TNG reruns have been losing momentum over the past few weeks , and the week 's run of " Time 's Arrow , Part 1 " gave the lowest ranking so far this year for TNG ( 19 ) , and the lowest viewing figures , at 2.32 million . Meanwhile , DS9 fared even worse , with their rerun offering ( " The Nagus " ) not even making it into the top 30 on BBC2 ( and so no actual ratings figures were available ) . This also was DS9 's worst rating of the season . One of the main reasons may have been the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the #1 ranking on Sunday , with the tennis cancelling other programs by several hours . Voyager , however , was not on that Sunday ( not a great shock ) . <p> Official ' Someone To Watch ...

Yesterday , Fan Club president Jeanne Fudala spoke to Marc Alaimo about the accident , and this is what she learned : <p> Yes , Avery DID ACCIDENTALLY knock Marc in the nose while filming a fight scene ! Marc said that Avery felt really bad about it ! They did take Marc to the ER , but he 's mostly fine . No " nose cast " as Jeanne put it .

The transcript is probably the most bandwidth-economical , as it lists everything there is to see and hear in the trailer . You can find the full transcript by going here , while the actual video trailers can still be found here at Vidiot 's site . <p> PLOT TWIST OF THE WEEK : I guess we are supposed to be impressed , alarmed -- something -- over the Breen joining the Dominion .

There 's certainly never been any indication before now that they are heavy hitters , but this week Worf tells us they are Very Dangerous , and that means that we the viewers should be Changing Our Shorts when we learn they 've sided with the Dominion . <p> It would have been a lot more interesting if the Tholians had turned up as Dominion allies . Sure , they were a one-shot race , but they were shown to be genuinely dangerous in TOS 's " The Tholian Web , " and they have an air of mystery about them that the Breen , who are just schmucks wearing helmets , ca n't touch . In addition , New Trek has been dropping the Tholian name on a regular basis for ten years or more , and it would be nice to have it finally pay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year and a half , DS9 has had a maddeningly erratic track record when it came to combining multiple stories in one episode . In some cases , such as last year 's " Rocks and Shoals " , it 's worked beautifully ; in others , such as last year 's finale " Tears of the Prophets " , it 's wound up feeling needlessly cluttered and scattershot rather than integrated and interesting . Given some of what I saw as filler last week ( particularly the Worf/Ezri stuff ) , then , I had a few qualms about its sequel going in . <p> Fortunately , I need n't have worried . " ' Til Death Do Us Part " is n't quite perfect , but it hits the mark in so many places that I 'd be quite happy if the rest of the year runs on this level . " ' Til Death Do Us Part " covers a huge amount of ground , involving characters as disparate as Admiral Ross , Kai Winn , and the female Founder , and actually makes sense out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close . <p> William Shatner is selling Belle Reve . He is downsizing his holdings but will retain some of his best Saddlebreds . He will , of course , continue to ride in competitions . BELLE REVE means " beautiful dream " in French .

Book signing appearances will soon be announced at the William Shatner Connection . <p> Mania Gossips About TrekChristian ( 11:13 am CST ) Michelle Erica Green apparently also visits Trek spoiler sites , as she just put up a summary of the latest Trek gossip at AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz .

It was easy to justify owning several Rikers - original ripped uniform , first-season uniform , altered to look like an alien , as his clone Tom , etc. - when each one cost a mere $5 , but how many of the $25-$35 variety does one really need ? <p> Well , in the case of the Star Trek : Insurrection action figures , the answer is : both . The 9-inch Insurrection figure is the first plastic Riker to appear without a beard , while the 12 " variety is wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film . I had hoped to find the 9-inch model compelling because I love the way Jonathan Frakes looks without a beard , but this boy wonder does n't look a thing like him - in fact , stick a Classic Trek uniform on the figure and you 'd think it was Dr. McCoy when he was young . <p> On the other hand , the 12-inch model is the best likeness of Riker we 've yet seen . When I heard Playmates was planning an ongoing 12-inch figure line , I expected them to be oversized , overpriced versions of the 9-inch models , but I have to admit that they 're extremely impressive-looking . If you 're only going to collect one size , I 'm sorry to tell your checkbook that it 's worth paying for the big ones . <p> If you 're very attached to that checkbook , you probably should n't click here , as Michelle Erica Green is extremely positive about most of the toys . If you do go there , though , the altruistic people at Mania also offer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web store - now , is n't that nice of them ? <p> -Today at 17:00 GMT , British station Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Captive Pursuit , ' which is also repeated at 23:30 GMT .

' As usual , click here to move on to the next update . <p> Alex Peckover at Sci-Fi World just posted an interesting tidbit about the DS9 finale , which is in direct contrast with some of the rumours that have been floating around earlier : <p> Some news from the National Enquirer has been floating around the various spoiler sites on the net . These sites state that Sisko will die in the finale , only to join the Prophets in the wormhole . Is this true ? No . Sisko does not die in the finale . <p> As usual , do keep in mind that this , too , has n't been officially confirmed yet - it could still very well be that Paramount will blow up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew live on happily ever after . <p> Rumors that circulated yesterday of Rene Auberjonois stating while at a convention that a DS9 movie is " absolutely certain " and that ways to preserve the set(s) were being looked into for this purpose , are unreliable . TrekWeb 's sources say that the Promenade set has already been torn down . Sources say that although rebuilding the set(s) is possible yet expensive , the destruction of the set decreases the likelihood of a DS9 movie anytime soon . <p> This certainly is sad news - the Promenade always had a special place in my heart , and I wish they would have been able to preserve the set . <p> ' Tacking Into The Wind ' Press ReleaseChristian ( 12:49 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains rather major spoilers for the upcoming DS9 episode ' Tacking Into The Wind , ' the 6th Final Chapter episode .

At the station , Bashir works through the night , trying to find a cure for Odo , while Sisko reproves Chancellor Gowron for reckless attacks which left General Martok injured . Back at the revel headquarters , Kira , eager to discover why the Federation 's Klingon ships are n't damaged by Breen-Dominion technology , proposes stealing the enemy 's weaponry so that the Federation can engineer a countermeasure . <p> Steve Krutzler at TrekWeb is reporting that the shooting of the DS9 finale has been delayed for a few days because of one of the most silly reasons imaginable : <p> TrekWeb.COM has learned that production has been extended for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marc Alaimo during a stunt fight scene . Avery Brooks threw a punch a little too deep and Marc 's timing was off ; Marc was hit in the nose by Avery . Marc 's appearance is vital to the scenes in question , so those scenes will be filmed after he 's had a few days to recover from his injuries . The final day of shooting now looks like April 27th , 1999 . <p> Thanks go out to Warp 11 and Holly Kim Wilson for pointing me to this . <p> Warp 11 Reviews ' Til Death Do Us Part'Christian ( 12:27 pm CST ) Warp Eleven just put up Curt Holman 's review of DS9 's ' Til Death Do Us Part , ' the second episode of the Final Chapter . The review mostly focuses on Gul Dukat , who Holman thinks is one of the most interesting characters of the entire series : <p> I find Dukat fascinating -- he might be the most complicated character in the entire Star Trek franchise , and Marc Alaimo 's always been bold and witty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure evil " at the end of Waltz always struck me as an oversimplification , since Dukat proved himself to be capable of doing good deeds ( albeit for selfish motives ) and for genuinely loving his daughter Ziyal . On " Do Us Part , " he even gives Damar a pep-talk without ulterior motive ( although I 've always marveled at Dukat 's ability to forgive the man who gunned down his daughter . ) Dukat 's character has gone through so many permutations over Deep Space Nine 's run that he 's hard to sum up quickly , but my take on him is this : he does n't just want to be feared as a powerful man , but be loved as a great one . But he knows he ca n't be a great man without being a good one -- and he is n't . <p> Of course , ' Til Death Do Us Part ' provided Holman with lots of opportunities to talk about Dukat , and that is precisely what he does in the full review . Go check it out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:21 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions just posted the trailers for the upcoming DS9 episode ' The Changing Face Of Evil .

' Today , he received confirmation from lead designer Chris Taylor informing him that he could provide the world with daily beta test reports : <p> Since Interplay was kind enough to let me in on their beta test of Starfleet Command , I thought you all would be interested in seeing some of my reactions to what I 'm seeing . Thankfully , the beta team is n't under a " gag order " , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please note that I will not post any information about plot points or anything that will make you feel " spoiled " . Rather , this is only going to be sort of a " diary " which chronicles gameplay , interface , graphics , sound , and realism issues . <p> Also note that this is only a beta version , and some aspects of the game will undoubtedly change . One final note : I am in what Interplay is calling the " control group " , or " people who have never played a game of Star Fleet Battles in their lives " . The opinions and notes herein are simply those of an old-school Trek fan . My main goal ( and that of Interplay ) is to see how regular Star Trek fans will react to this game . I will closely monitor its accuracy to established Star Trek precedents . I hope you find these notes exciting and informative . My sincere thanks to the Starfleet Command design team for offering me this opportunity ! <p> Voyager production starts on June 8th .

RenT had never believed in it but a big shot from Paramount told him recently that it is absolutely sure . It seems there are also discussions going on how to preserve the DS9 station set for future use . <p> This certainly is good news ! Let 's hope RenT Auberjonois is actually right about this .

For months now , the BBC Voyager schedule has been extremely erratic , and at the rate they 're currently progressing they wo n't even be able to finish season four before the millennium is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arquati at the Star Trek Collective has launced the ' Treat Trek Fairly ' campaign in the form of a petition you can sign online : <p> A letter will be sent to the BBC , by email and by post . Hopefully , we 'll send it to Viewer and Listener Comments , and Points of View . Who knows , we could even get a newspaper to say something about the petition ! But whatever happens , we 'd like your name and email address on the letter as support for the cause . I 've made it especially easy to send in your name and email address for inclusion - there 's a form below . That 's all we require - any additional information to send in is optional . <p> Currently more than 60 people have signed up for the petition , but they can always use more - go here to read more about it and sign up . <p> Unfortunately , this is n't the only problem British Trek fans will have to face , as today Jonathan Davies posted the following alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Subject : SKY dumps Star Trek for a year gap ! In response to Majel Barret , and the general concensus towards the " there 's too much Trek " opinion SKY 1 is droping Star Trek from it 's screens this summer for a 1 Year gap ! <p> After I e-mailed Jonathan about this , he mentioned ' a friend told him this over the phone ' - he 's currently trying to find out where this info came from . Thanks , Jonathan ! The Majel Barret thing is apparently referring to a letter she recently sent to a sci-fi magazine about the current state of Star Trek , if anyone knows precisely which magazine this is reffering to , please let me know . More on the Sky One news will be reported here as soon as I hear about it . <p> Shatner 's ' Dark Victory ' A BestsellerChristian ( 11:22 am CST ) A news article from Reuters just appeared at Yahoo ! , listing the current top 15 hardcover fiction bestsellers , according to the April 19 edition of ' Publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourites such as Steven King , Danielle Steel and John Grisham , but I was happy to notice that William Shatner 's new novel ' Dark Victory ' also made it to the top 15 , albeit just at place 15 . The full top 15 can be found by going here . <p> We are working very very hard on getting the first beta ( let 's call it alpha ) in shape . So many things are getting in , finalized , looking cool - it is really a big morale push . The whole team is working on Sunday to help get this alpha out as soon as possible . We are still actively creating features and will continue through to about 5/15/99 . Thus the alpha and early beta may have not include some features . For example , the Gorn interface is only about 15% complete , and fighters as a complete feature is about 30% complete . <p> In the full update he talks about some of the things the team is still working on , but also mentions a new preview that just appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molstad talks to the aforementioned Erik Bethke about the special features that will make the game worth buying : <p> " The game offers a highly accurate representation of the Star Trek universe in an exciting real-time setting . It will combine in-depth strategic planning with cinematic , head-to-head action for up to six players via LAN , modem to modem , null modem cable and Interplay 's Internet matching service . STAR TREK : Starfleet Command will feature classic Star Trek television and movie footage in its introduction plus engaging audio clips throughout the game . " <p> " STAR TREK : Starfleet Command will allow the gamer to play one of several races including the most popular : Federation , Klingon , Romulan , and even some new races . There will also be a random campaign game generator featuring the new Dynaverse scenario engine so the gamer can truly create his or her own unique destiny . The missions the player receives will be a direct result of , and have a direct impact upon , the current state of galactic affairs in an ever-changing galaxy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jonathan Frakes : It 's still doing well . I just returned from opening it in Spain and Brussels , where everyone had gone to Germany to see it . Months before . <p> Jordan G asks : What is this DS9 Final Chapter thing ? Is the show going off air ? <p> Jonathan Frakes : They 've already ripped the sets down on Stage 17 . <p> Katja asks : We all know that the whole TNG cast really likes each other . Can you describe the very first day where you met your " crewmembers " at the set ? <p> Jonathan Frakes : I remember meeting Patrick Stewart outside the make up trailer for our first day of make-up tests . I almost said make-up and hair tests ... but only some of us went to the hair trailer . He and I discussed the relative merits of cricket vs. baseball . <p> Read lots more ( including a confirmation of the rumour which said that Frakes wanted to wait until after Star Wars with the next Trek movie ) by clicking here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , Sky One is showing DS9 's ' For The Cause ' today at 16:00 GMT , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Worst Case Scenario .

Take a look at one of those new sites : <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:20 am CST ) I just noticed on my ' Stardate Calendar ' that tomorrow is listed as Avery Brooks ' ' un-birthday . ' Looks like the people at Pocket Books also liked ' Alice in Wonderland . ' ; - ) <p> The writers are all back , scribbling like mad trying to tie up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the B plot , the show is about 5 mins short . So , the writers are currently trying to write scenes based on the actors that are available . Most are out of the country , so they have to use the others . I am not sure who all is around right now . I know Jeri is , because we just looped her for ' Relativity ' this past week . I think Bob Picardo is in town , and Robbie also . I 'm not sure who else is available . It should be interesting . <p> More news on this will of course be reported here as it becomes available . Thanks go out again to Warp 11 for pointing me to this . <p> Voyager Episode SpoilersChristian ( 2:24 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains major spoilers for several upcoming episodes from Voyager 's fifth season . If you want to avoid reading these spoilers , click here to move on to the next article . <p> Warning - Most of the remaining fifth season episodes are thoroughly spoiled in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WebTrek has posted lots of new info on several upcoming Voyager episodes . I 've listed the most important info here below : <p> In ' Juggernaut , ' which airs on the 26th of March , we 'll see for the first time ever a sonic shower in action . Some lovely pictures that show *why* the characters actually need a shower can be found here . <p> A large portion of ' 11:59 , ' which airs on the 5th of May , actually takes place on Earth , even if it is the Earth of several centuries before Voyager . Also , Janeway 's ancestor has a love interest played by Kevin Tighe ( DeSoto from " Emergency " ) . <p> It is now confirmed that ' Warhead , ' the episode airing on the 19th of May , does n't have anything to do with the season finale . In the episode , ' Voyager responds to an automated distress signal , and it turns out to be the bomb , which is " sentient " and feels it can only be satisfied if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can implant the personality of the bomb into the Doctor : they try to give the intelligence a body . It takes over the Doctor , holds Torres and Kim hostage , and threatens to destroy the ship if Janeway does n't help him complete his mission to blow up some alien thing . Kim finds out that the launch was a mistake , but the bomb does n't want to hear about it . He just wants to blow up his target . <p> Lastly , the season finale ( ' Equinox ' ) is currently undergoing some reshoots . ' The B plot -- involving the Doctor being replaced by the Equinox ' EMH who 's ethical sub-routines have been removed to figure out a way to suck the energy out of the aliens -- is being dumped since it was believed to be too similar to " Warhead . " The new scenes will , for the most part , center around Tom Paris . ' Equinox is scheduled to air on the 26th of May . <p> More can be found at WebTrek 's news page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 for pointing me to them , and for providing me with the airdates . <p> Trek CCG Creators InterviewChristian ( 2:04 pm CST ) The Decipher web site is reporting that this week 's edition of Radio Free Decipher contains an exclusive interview with Tom Braunlich and Rollie Tesh , game creators for Decipher . Fortunately , the people at Decipher also put up a transcript online , which includes the following quote of them talking about their early Decipher days : <p> Q : What Decipher products have you contributed to ? TOM : Decipher has done a lot of our games . Besides Pente , ( which Decipher now sells ) , they did No Dice ( a nice strategy game ) , Scratchees ( scratch-off games ) , How To Host A Scavenger Hunt , plus the Star Trek and Star Wars CCGs . This past year we have done some more projects with them , including Girl Power , Animorphs , and some other stuff I guess we ca n't discuss yet . ROLLIE : We also co-designed the Star Trek VCR game , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More can be found in the full transcript , though they 're mostly talking about their upcoming ' Young Jedi ' Customizable Card Game . <p> It 's official - we 're knee deep in arc . I wish we had more of it this season , because Penumbra was surprisingly involving . This is good stuff . Babylon 5 for awhile did this well , too ... I 'd argue that DS9 has the potential to do more , because it has so many things that need to be done that it 's bound to make involving TV . <p> In the end , Perry awards the episode a ' B+/A- ' - find his full reasons for that here . <p> ' Relativity ' Synopsis UpdatedChristian ( 1:16 pm CST ) You may recall that several days ago TrekToday ( and several other Trek news sites ) posted a synopsis of the upcoming Voyager episode ' Relativity , ' which was sent to us by an anonymous source . Today , Timothy Verheecke , webmaster of Web Trek , posted some extra info on the episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insider at Paramount . <p> ' 415Man ' makes some corrections to the already-known Relativity Synopsis , provides some extra information , and denies a few of the things happening in the old synopsis . You can read it all by going here and viewing the Web Trek synopsis , though a local copy is also available here at TrekToday . <p> This week , the competition deals with the mysterious disappearance of Lieutenant Joe Carey : <p> The disappearing Lieutenant Carey ! Voyager watches have surely noticed the mysterious disappearance of Lieutenant Carey after a recurring role in Season 1 . He was n't killed on an away mission or destroyed in a transporter accident . He just plain disappeared ! Also , if you have a suggestion for a sevname for Lieutenant Joseph Carey , suggest it on the Ideas Board . <p> Considering Joe Carey will actually be returning on the 12th of May in the upcoming Voyager episode ' Relativity , ' I 'd say this is n't actually an example of great timing . As usual , if you think of any great punchlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " proved to be less than stellar in its second airing , falling to a 2.8 rating , 4 share . That should place the episode right at , or possibly below the lowest rating of the year to date , " Unforgettable " ' s rerun , which earned a 2.2 . That 2.8 overnight is down half a point from last week 's " Infinite Regress " ( 3.3 ) . <p> ... <p> Again , this is a pretty bad rating , but it does n't mean a whole lot . This episode , like " Infinite Regress " last week performed poorly in its first airing , and it looks to do so again . Next week , the ratings and the signifigance factor come back up with the rerun of " Timeless . " National numbers will be posted when I recieve them . <p> More on this can be found in the full report , though it wo n't make you much happier . <p> In DS9 ratings news , the Nielsen Ratings Info Database is mentioning that the repeat of DS9 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top 25 , so ratings data for that episode wo n't come out until next Wednesday . <p> ' Lives of Dax ' Anthology InfoChristian ( 1:14 pm CST ) At the Star Trek Books bulletin board on the Pocket Books site , editor Marco Palmieri just gave some extra info on the upcoming ' Lives of Dax ' anthology . ' Lives of Dax ' will be a book with short stories dealing with each of Dax ' nine hosts , and this is what Palmieri just announced : <p> The following is the author lineup for THE LIVES OF DAX anthology , by order of host : <p> Quite probably this will mean that the ' Lives of Dax ' anthology will be the first Trek novel to feature an original story dealing with Ezri Dax . Later on , Palmieri also said the following about the novel : <p> The stories will stand alone , being episodes from the life of each host , but together they weave the tapestry of Dax 's life across 357 years of Star Trek history . And yes , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> People who are interested in hearing more about this should probably visit the Books BBS . <p> GameSpot Previews Starfleet CommandChristian ( 1:14 pm CST ) Denny Atkin at GameSpot has just put up a new preview of the upcoming Interplay game Starfleet Command . The preview is pretty in-depth , and even provides us with some information on the game 's storyline : <p> The overlying storyline focuses on the disappearance of the Organians , the all-powerful race that forced a treaty on the Klingons and Federation in the original Trek series . Not only does the Organians ' disappearance open the door to lots of aggressive behavior throughout the galaxy , but it also causes some very weird occurrences , including rifts opening into other universes and the appearance of some big , mean space monsters . <p> The campaign is broken into six segments , one for each race . While each plays out individually , by the time you 've finished , they 'll form a coherent story that ties into the Organian disappearance . The version we played included only a few sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising . Trek fans , for instance , will appreciate the Federation sequence , which combines elements of two of the best episodes of the original series : Mirror , Mirror and The Doomsday Machine . It seems that , in the mirror universe , Commodore Decker survived his run-in with the Planet Killer . Escaping from that universe 's Spock , he travels to our universe , where he hopes to take control of the Planet Killers and conquer the Federation . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 1:12 pm CST ) Even with the site being down for most of the day , we still had one site submission at TrekSeek yesterday , namely : -The Borg Collective , which is a site pertaining to all things Borg . Contains pics , lists , an extensive history of the Borg , and more . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:10 pm CST ) Phew . It 's certainly been a busy few hours for us . This afternoon , I logged on to the net and wanted to visit our Trek search engine TrekSeek . I was greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I nearly fainted , thinking about all the other people who had visited the site for nothing . <p> After doing some investigating , it turned out TrekSeek had been temporarily taken down because of the last problems I had ever expected - the site was too popular ! Apparently , our ' jump.cgi ' script , which actually sends you on to the sites you want to visit from TrekSeek , was being used so many times it used up nearly all the CPU resources of the server TrekSeek resides on , so the site had to be taken down . <p> Naturally , we were n't too thrilled with this , so we quickly put up a temporary fix and were able to get the site re-opened . Our sincere apologies for all of you who tried to visit the site over the past 12 hours or so - hopefully it wo n't be happening again . An extra apology should also go out to Jamahl Epsicokhan , whose Star Trek Hypertext is hosted at TrekSeek , and therefore was also down today . <p> Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're almost completely certain it wo n't be happening again , so go pay the site a visit ! <p> Those unacquainted ( or out of sympathy ) with the five-year mission of the U.S.S. Enterprise will find little to interest them in Horatius , a baldly written narrative of one of Captain Kirk 's less-gripping adventures . Fans of Trek fiction , too , may be disappointed , since there is none of the deep examination of these well-known characters that can be found in the countless novels written in recent years . <p> Horatius was the first Trek novel , preceding James Blish 's Spock Must Die by two years . Originally part of a series of juvenile books based on popular TV series , it was out of print for 30 years before being " rescued " by Pocket Books in a collector 's edition that closely reproduces the original . Just as the typography reflects this book as it existed in 1968 , so the story reflects Star Trek at that time--and therein lies its interest . Star Trek is shown young but in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Horatius explores what it would be like to serve on the cramped original Enterprise--below decks as well as among the officers on the bridge--as the missions blur together . <p> In the end , reviewer Mark Wilson recommends the book for ' completists ' - his reasons for that , plus a full synopsis of the novel , can be found by going here . <p> TV Zone Features Trek CounselorsChristian ( 1:42 pm CST ) The May issue of cult television magazine TV Zone features interviews with the actresses playing the two counselors in Star Trek - Marina Sirtis ( Deanna Troi ) and Nicole deBoer ( Ezri Dax ) . Unfortunately , only a short description is available of what the deBoer interview has to offer you : <p> New girl Nicole de Boer chats about joining the show for its seventh and final season , and why she was so amazed at the fan reaction to her getting the job . <p> Fortunately , there is a short preview available of the interview with Marina Sirtis , in which she talks about her experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had been in the States for around only seven months when we began filming the pilot . When I came over here I wanted to learn more about the American method of acting because all of my favourite actors are heavy-duty method actors . So I went to this class and tried to grasp this in the time I had before we began shooting . What I 'd done , literally , was the ' Dummies ' approach to method acting . <p> " I took what I thought I 'd learned and tried to apply it in the pilot and it was horrible , " laughs Sirtis . " I remember watching the episode through my fingers because I had my hands over my face . I was amazed that I still had my job by the end of it ... " <p> Although I liked this episode , I do n't feel that it was as good or as interesting as Penumbra . Its main flaw is that it seemed much more choppy with too many short scenes and too many secondary characters getting the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suspense , build up , and emotional wallop that last week began . That 's not to say it was n't interesting and did n't have its moments--but , in a single word , the episode was " fragmented . " I fear that the writers of DS9 have done such a marvellous job of adding layer upon layer to an epic story , allowing them to build , change , develop , and surprise successfully over the last seven years , that now , as everything is coming to an end , they have too many layers to deal with . <p> Find more in the full review . Thanks go out to Psi Phi for pointing me to this , even if their link is still pointing to the old ' Penumbra ' review . <p> SCIFI HQ Penumbra Clips AvailableChristian ( 11:04 am CST ) SCIFI Headquarters has just put up six new clips from DS9 's ' Penumbra , ' the first episode of the Final Chapter . I 'm not sure about the legality of this , but they offer you the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Sisko choosing Jake as best man and Ezri leaving to search for Worf .

In case you want to avoid reading these spoilers , click here to move on to the next article and still be able to enjoy the episode without knowing anything about it . <p> Again , click here to be transported to the next update - there really are some major spoilers to be found below . <p> Glen at Ai n't It Cool News has posted some extra info on the DS9 finale . First of all , he mentions the TrekWeb reprint of the National Enquirer 's finale preview , and Glen adds to this that the finale probably wo n't appeal to everyone : <p> I believe many Babylon 5 fans will draw strong parallels to that series ' closing episode ( " Sleeping in Light " ) . Also , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see an apocalyptic attack on DS9 . There is a gigantic , balls-to-the-wall space battle in the finale , but it takes place no where close to DS9 . <p> Does " What You Leave Behind " anihilate the possibility of following-up the series with TV movies or a feature film ? No . It 's a solid script with some magnificent moments , but this last show might be characterized as a bit too " safe " when all is said and done - by viewers expecting a little more " oomph " . And - to dispel another rumor which has been hanging out there lately - no , Worf does not go back to the Enterprise E in the series ' finale . He &amp; O'Brien get new ( unrelated ) jobs though , but neither is on Enterprise . They are jobs which could ... reasonably ... re-insert them into the Next Generation or Deep Space Nine mythos if needed at a later Date . <p> On top of that , Glen also provides some extra info on what will happen to the various characters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disenfranchised , action-seeking , lonely young doctor finds love , action , and home on DS9 in the series ' finale . Kira 's previously genocidal hatred of Cardassians has now evolved into an admission and understanding that Bajor ( her world ) and Cardassia ( the world of her enemies ) are actually critically connected &amp; entwined . Odo discovers that even though he is more or less detached from The Great Link , he still has incredible value and significance to them ( making him feel much better about who he is ) , and has the capacity to make all the difference when the chips are down . <p> Later on , in the Talk Back section of the site , Glen also revealed that the last line of the finale belongs to none other than Quark , who says : ' the more things change , the more they stay the same .

Foundation Imaging , a computer graphics/effects company , which has done work for shows like Voyager and Babylon 5 , is looking for people to model and animate the new Starship Troopers TV series . <p> Perhaps , if you 're real good , you might even be allowed to move over to their Voyager team after a while .

The preview is basically a ' first look ' at the game , and does n't seem to be held back by any actual knowledge of the game itself : <p> In BOF , players can choose to play one of five major powers : the Federation , Romulans , Klingons , Ferengi , or Cardassians .

Who knows ? In your hands , the Romulans might actually be trustworthy . <p> Still , there are a few nice screenshots in the full preview , so you still might want to check it out .

There are roughly 50 hull types and hundreds of variants that can be selected , allowing for the creation of a huge variety of ships .

There 's a bunch of new overlays , background histories ( a whole section on the UFP Merchant Marine ) , 15 new ships , tech , stuff on the Son'a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trekly fun . <p> Although this is all he says on the TNG RPG , some news on the TOS RPG he 's currently working on can be found in the full column , together with reviews of more than a dozen other RPG books . <p> Jeff Mariotte Interview UpdatedChristian ( 11:14 am CST ) Because we liked it so much , we 've given Monday 's interview with Jeff Mariotte a permanent place in the Longer Articles section . Even if you 've already read it , it 's still worth checking out again , as I 've added a few extra comments from Jeff to the interview , including this ' current progress report : ' <p> I 'm already soliciting stories from a variety of writers , and reading unsolicited stories from others . These will go through our approval process ( assuming I approve them , of course ) . Once approved , I 'll be lining up art teams to draw them , arranging for productions and shepherding them through to the printing process . <p> In the full interview , he goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appearing , WildStorm 's focus on ' quality over quantity , ' and the ' Early Voyages ' series .

According to CARPE , the Central Alliance of Robert Picardo Enthusiasts , Robert Picardo ( The Doctor ) recently joined the Advisiory Council of the Planetary Society : <p> Robert Picardo recently received ( and accepted ! ) an invitation to become a member of the Advisory Council of the Planetary Society . The Society was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan , Bruce Murray , and Louis Friedman to encourage the exploration of our solar system and the search for extraterrestrial life . It 's a nonprofit , nongovernmental organization , funded by dues and donations from individuals around the world . The Society encourages all spacefaring nations to explore other worlds , supports educational activities about the exploration of the solar system and the search for extraterrestrial life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can seed future projects of planetary exploration . <p> According to the press release from the Planetary Society , Robert Picardo has already been very active in this new role : <p> Robert Picardo has quickly become active participants during their short tenure . Picardo recently served as MC for the official burning of the mortgage on the Society 's headquarters in Pasadena , California . Nye will co-chair , with Buzz Aldrin , the Society 's upcoming festival , Planetfest ' 99 , on December 3-5 as the Mars Polar Lander arrives at the Red Planet . <p> Kristine Kathryn Rusch ChatChristian ( 11:08 am CST ) The Sci-Fi Channel will soon be organising a panel discussion with some of the nominees for the prestigious Nebula awards . One of the participants will be Kristine Kathryn Rusch , who was nominated for her novelette ' Echea . ' For us Trek fans , she might perhaps be more familiar as the co-author of more than a dozen Trek novels , together with her husband Dean Wesley Smith . For more on what the chat will bring you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a live chat with , among others , Vonda N. McIntyre , who has also published several Trek novels . Sorry for not reporting this in time , but fortunately a transcript will be up in a few days here . <p> CHEMISTRY OF THE WEEK : None that I can find , either in the Ezri/Worf tryst , or the Sisko/Yates engagement . The latter relationship has never really worked , in my opinion , largely due to acting on the part of both Brooks and Johnson , and although this episode was better than many in this regard , it still does n't play . Just look at that kiss ; they act like they ca n't stand each other ! <p> Even so , he still awards the episode with a 7,5 - more , erm , arguments against that rating can be found by reading the full review . <p> " Infinite Regress " did not perform as poorly as I suspected it would from the overnight ratings , earning a 2.6 rating , 5 share . That places it just below the average rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't place it below the lowest-rated rerun this year , " Unforgettable , " which only mustered up a 2.2 . This 2.6 rating is down from last year 's first-run " Vis a Vis , " which managed a 3.1 , and also down from the last stint of reruns in which both episodes turned in a 2.7 . <p> ... <p> As indicated in the overnight ratings post for this episode , these ratings do n't mean a whole lot for the rest of the season . Next week is slightly more important and " Timeless " ' s rerun will be quite signifigant . If anything , this rerun of " Infinite Regress " shows that the audience as far as reruns goes has n't fallen off much , if at all , this season . Considering the fact that " Infinite Regress " was one of this years ' worst performances in its first airing , this rating is decent . <p> It is Real Video G2 and since it was a long interview ( 8 minutes ) I made it at 80KBPS , 160x120 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my regular quality the file size would have been about 12 MB or more . <p> Alternatively , if you just want to see pictures of Jeri Ryan , the Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage has just put up twenty-three images of her appearance at the show . According to the site , she talked about ' her recent TV Guide cover , Duran Duran and the very early days of the official Jeri Lynn Ryan homepage . ' You can find the images by going here . <p> Ordover Posts Q&amp;A At Trek ForumsChristian ( 11:05 am CST ) Because of technical difficulties , John Ordover'sQ&amp;A page is currently not functioning . Fortunately , the Star Trek novel editor at Pocket Books just posted a whole series of responses at Pocket 's Star Trek Books forum , answering all the questions that were asked over the past week or so . Take a look at some of the highlights : <p> Question : The producers of DS9 have stated that the series finale will have a finality to it that TNG did not . ( Nothing really " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Do you already have access to the series finale story ? 2 ) Will you be allowed to continue the story of the DS9 characters and situations no matter what the ending brings us ? <p> Answer : I can answer two but not one : We will be allowed to continue the story of DS9 after the finale , just like we were for TNG . But how we will deal with the situation we 're left with at the end remains to be decided . <p> Question : I 've noticed there 's seems to be a pool of writers that you seem to draw from . Is this because these are proven writers with good track records or are there very few good product as far as writing goes ? <p> Answer : It takes a special talent to write well within a shared universe . We 're always looking for new voices , but we 'll keep going back to those who can handle it well . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 11:05 am CST ) -In the US , UPN will be repeating Voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time . Take a look at what the episode has in store for you , courtesy of the official Star Trek Continuum : <p> As the U.S.S. Voyager rescues two families of telepathic alien refugees from the Devore Imperium , they are intercepted by a Devore squadron and boarded by inspectors searching for the defectors . Soon Kashyk , the lead Devore officer pleads with Janeway to grant him asylum . <p> -Tonight , the Sci-Fi Channel will be broadcasting TNG 's ' Mark of Gideon ' at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time . <p> -Today at 17:00 GMT , British station Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Past Prologue , ' the first regular episode of the first season . The episode also repeats at 23:30 , in case you miss it . At 18:00 GMT , BBC 2 will be showing TNG 's ' Time 's Arrow , Part Two , ' the conclusion to yesterday 's Part One . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 11:04 am CST ) Unfortunately , no more than 3 sites were added to TrekSeek yesterday , still bringing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at what two of those new sites promise to bring you : <p> -The Tom Paris Adjective Page is made by some seriously obsessive people - here you 'll find descriptions of all of Tom Paris ' bodyparts , as well as lots of Tom Paris pictures . -Fondazione Vulcaniana tells you all you will ever need to know about Vulcan and the Vulcans . The site is in Italian , though , so most of us probably wo n't find it very useful . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:03 am CST ) I just noticed this story at the Sci-Fi Channel 's news service which made me very excited - apparently Ridley Scott will be directing the movie version of Isaac Asimov 's novel ' The End of Eternity . ' I *so* desperately want to see that movie - ' Blade Runner ' is still my all-time favourite movie , and ' The End of Eternity ' was one of the best books Asimov ever wrote . Let 's hope the movie will be finished soon - I ca n't wait to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting comments at the convention . First of all , he said he ' had a feeling ' Voyager would be returning to the Alpha Quadrant ' sometime next season . ' Secondly , he said that since DS9 will be ending soon , Paramount will ' probably ' launch a new Trek series in 2000 . Even though Picardo obviously has n't been told everything , as an actor he has probably picked up a few hints from the writers , so this is still rather interesting . <p> A more appropriate title for " Penumbra " might be " A Tale of Two Romances " ; the three successors to " Penumbra " were supposed to be titled " Umbra " , " Eclipse " , and " Emergence " , but since those three have changed " Penumbra " itself is a somewhat meaningless title . " A Tale of Two Romances " neatly sums up most of the episode , dealing as it does with the continuance of the Sisko/Kasidy romance and the probable beginnings of a Worf/Ezri one . Both have their charms , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was said and done . <p> To find out which one came off as the most real romance , take a look at the full review . <p> Hollywood Museum Honours Star TrekChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) This comes from the last source I would ever have expected to get Star Trek news from , but the ' General Daily , ' my local Dutch newspaper , is reporting that the new ' Hollywood Entertainment Museum ' currently has a special Star Trek attraction . Take a look at a translation of part of the article : <p> Star Trek 's special effects are n't just explained in a very clear way , they are also made visible in a very imaginative way . If you wish , you can be ' beamed ' to the cockpit of the U.S.S. Enterprise , where you can then set a course for the ship . It is surprising to experience how something that looks cheap in the studio , can be made to look completely natural using the camera and the right lighting . <p> This new attraction is locatet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in Hollywood . If anyone knows more about this , I 'd love to hear something about it . <p> New Playmates Schedule AvailableChristian ( 12:26 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac has just received an updated toy release schedule from the people at Playmates , who actually produce the toys . For the most , the release dates for the 9 " and 12 " figures remain pretty much the same , though some of them have been delayed by a few weeks . There is a piece of sad news included in it , though : <p> The 12 " Electronic Profiles figures have been put on " hold . " Presumably , Playmates is seeking out additional retailer support for this line before going forward with it . <p> Take a look at all the changes by going here , or just read the full release date schedule by going here . <p> As we head into the final stretch of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , the commonly adopted name for this major story arc , " Deep Space Nine : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With " Penumbra , " we can see the latest of the groundwork being paved . <p> And if " Penumbra " is any indication , it 's going to be tough to judge these early episodes as individuals until we know more--maybe a lot more . I liked " Penumbra . " I was n't riveted by a lot of it , but I 'm more than intrigued about where these elements will take us . <p> In the end , he awards the episode 3 out of 4 stars , as you can read in the full review . <p> It 's interesting to see how all the wild rumours that appeared on the net over the past few weeks all appear in these headlines - they are also all unconfirmed or even blatantly untrue , a fact the people organising this obviously chose to ignore . As usual , do n't believe any of these headlines until they are confirmed elsewhere - the only reason the page exists is to let people call an expensive phone number . <p> Psi Phi is pleased to announce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 , the fifth and probably final annual Netquisition contest will be accepting entries . Prizes , including copies of the " DS9 Technical Manual " , " Legends of the Ferengi " , and " The 34th Rule " will be awarded to the top three winners . <p> Rules will be accepted through May 1 , 1999 , and voting by visitors to Psi Phi will take place between May 3 and May 30 , 1999 . <p> Digital Streams Creates New Trek CGIChristian ( 12:07 pm CST ) The people at Digital Streams have just put up a new , completely re-worked version of the Original Series ' famous opening sequence . The opening sequence is part of their re-worked version of ' The Doomsday Machine , ' in its original version one of Classic Trek 's most famous episodes : <p> " The Doomsday Machine " is one of the classic episodes of the original Star Trek series . As part of our 1994 demo presentation to Paramount , we enhanced that treasured episode with state-of-the art special effects . <p> According to The Lensman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this ) , this opening clip was actually created last year , when Digital Streams re-did the full episode . You can download the picture at the Digital Streams download area , which is where you 'll also find some other clips from ' The Doomsday Machine ' which were already put up earlier . <p> After downloading the video , I have to say it is indeed looking impressive , though not as good as it could have been - what happened , for instance , to the bright colours of the planets ? Why did Digital Streams have to use boring grey ? In any case , you can see for yourself how the new opening sequence turned out by going here . <p> Jonathan Frakes Chat On ThursdayChristian ( 12:06 pm CST ) This Thursday , the Continuum will be hosting a live chat with Jonathan Frakes ( William T.

Check out the Continuum 's Auditorium for more . <p> James Darren Goes To HollywoodChristian ( 12:06 pm CST ) Or Planet Hollywood , at least . According to the Continuum , actor James Darren ( DS9 , Vic Fontaine ) will be attending a press event at the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Atlantic City . The event will take place this Thursday , April 15 , at 1:00pm Eastern Time . I have n't got a clue why exactly he 'll be there , but as soon as I hear more I 'll be reporting about it here . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 12:05 pm CST ) Incredibly , we 're now up to 974 Star Trek links at TrekSeek - we might still reach the magic 1000 before the weekend !

Sorry ! Anyways , this is what Warp 11 had to report : <p> Jerry Mannor posted a message on TrekWeb 's messageboard saying he just came from a convention in Southfield Michigan with Marc Alaimo Dukat . Marc Alaimo hinted that in the final episode Dukat and Sisko have a fight scene , and that they left Dukat 's death an iffy thing so that it might look like he 's dead but he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond that . <p> Wildstorm Comics Editor Speaks OutChristian ( 12:53 pm CST ) As you may know , a few months ago WildStorm obtained the Trek comics license via its parent company DC Comics . Recently , WildStorm 's Trek editor Jeff Mariotte was kind enough to answer a few questions about WildStorm 's plans with its Trek line . <p> First of all , I asked him about the frequency at which WildStorm will be publishing their Trek comics : <p> The plan is to have something out every month -- either a Prestige Format one-shot or an issue of a miniseries . Also , the minis will be collected into Trade paperbacks after a while . Some months there will be more than one Trek book , but there should n't be any month after November in which there are none . <p> As I myself rather liked Marvel 's ' Early Voyages ' series , which chronicled the adventures of Captain Pike and his crew , I also asked Jeff if WildStorm was considering publishing these stories as well . Unfortunately , it seems that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future : <p> We only have a couple of years and a limited number of issues to work with , and at this point it 's our sense that people would rather see adventures of the better-known crews than anything that had been created just for comics . that could change , of course , if we hear a groundswell or interest for more " Early Voyages " tales , but nothing 's in our plans right now . <p> Although this certainly is disappointing news , I have no doubt that in the capable hands of Jeff Mariotte the comics will turn out to be absolutely wonderful . He certainly is experienced enough to handle the task : <p> I own a specialty science fiction/mystery/horror bookstore , Mysterious Galaxy , here in San Diego . I have been selling books for almost 20 years , and know most of the authors in the field . I also am a writer , and have published short science fiction . I have not been a die-hard Trekker , but I 've had dinner with Nichelle Nichols ( ! ) and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to educate myself further with regards to all things Star Trek , though . <p> Major thanks go out to Jeff for answering my questions - I truly appreciate it .

The reason for this is probably that I posted about the problems at a few Trek forums , which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ever . Maybe we should be switching IP addresses every week or so ...

A little fearful , but very excited none the less . Seven years of watching what is definately my favorite version of Star Trek and Sci fi in general , with all the twists , turns , arcs , and developments--coupled with the characters that are definately interesting , Roddenbery 's heart still present , and the exploration of the darker side of human nature looks to pay off BIG . There is a LOT of anticipation for this final chapter , perhaps rivaled ONLY by the Phantom Menace . But I am definately excited for the next installment of the final chapter . <p> 11:59 Spoilers AvailableChristian ( 12:31 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains spoilers for the upcoming Voyager episode ' 11:59 . ' In case you want to avoid reading these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article . <p> The Great Link has posted some new information on Voyager 's ' 11:59 , ' which will air on the 24th of March .

This might actually be the last time you 'll be visiting the Great Link in the next two weeks , as the Great Link 's webmaster , Chris Howell just announced the following : <p> This will probably be the last TGL update for a while , probably the last update for the next 10-14 days .

Still , I 'll have some work to do on the house , and I 'm not sure how long it will take me to do that work . If I ( somehow ) find time to update TGL in the next 2 weeks , I will . But until then .... <p> Sev Trek Picard Cartoon OnlineChristian ( 12:31 pm CST ) Due to a problem with his scanner , Sev Trek'sJohn Cook was n't able to post new cartoons for a while .

It will , however , have a " brief featurette " on the making of the film , trailer(s) , and web links that can be used by DVD-ROM owners like myself . The disc will be THX-certified , 16x9 enhanced , and have English soundtracks in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 . There will also be Spanish subtitles and English closed-captioning . I do n't know if this is the final info on the subject--I 'll keep checking . <p> This is the first in a serie of nine reviews of the last nine episodes of Deep Space 9 's Final Chapter , exclusively written by Curt Holman for Warp Eleven . Curt Holman is a freelance writer in Atlanta , Georgia , who reviews television , theater , film and books for Creative Loafing and restaurants for CitySearch Atlanta . Mr. Holman has limited the amount of spoilers to a minimum . Enjoy ! <p> ' Enjoy ' is also something Curt Holman did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot : <p> Who is going to die ? What is the origin of the Founders ' disease ? Will we see " Benny Russell " again ? How about those " locusts " Sisko spoke of in Rapture ? <p> These and other questions are on the minds of DS9 fans going in to the long-awaited " Final Chapter , " for which Penumbra is a sort of overture and first movement . The final arc promises all manner of interstellar upheaval and major shifts in the quadrant 's balance of power , so it 's sort of ironic that " Penumbra 's " main concern proved to be marriage . <p> In the end he awards the episode with a ' B , ' as you can read in the full review . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 12:30 pm CST ) -In the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The Muse ' at 16:00 GMT , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Displaced .

It is explained that Sisko is now one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to his wife in one last vision and tell her what has happened . <p> This certainly is a rather shocking end , though it has already been reported that Sisko will be joining the Prophets by a few other sources .

' The film , which is currently on the Home Box Office schedule for August , is based on Earl Mills ' biography ' Dorothy Dandridge . ' Brent Spiner was actually cast as this Earl Mill , who was the manager of Dorothy Dandridge . Take a look at what the film is about , according to the official press release : <p> DOROTHY DANDRIDGE traces the true story of the legendary black actress ( Berry ) from her youth to her tragic early death . Dandridge achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen Jones , " making history by becoming the first black woman ever nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. Along with her accomplishments came heartache and despair over two high-profile failed marriages , a love affair with Otto Preminger ( Brandauer ) , the institutionalization of her only daughter , and drug dependency . <p> First ' Trekminds ' Broadcast AvailableChristian ( 1:09 pm CST ) The German Star Trek Index is reporting that the very first edition of Radio Trek 's ' Trekminds ' program is now available for your listening pleasure . Trekminds is a bi-weekly radio show in which certain themes will be discussed with listeners via telephone , fax or e-mail .

As you can probably see from the picture this is the episode where the Doctor falls in love with Seven of Nine and takes Seven on her first date . More info on the episode itself and another picture can be found by going here . <p> For a while now , we 've heard rumors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no one could say for sure . Well , I just checked Chris 's DVD Release List on SurroundFreak 's Home-theater Site and discovered that the disc will have both trailers and extras , but not commentary ( no surprise there ) . I 've been checking Chris 's list for a year now , and have n't been led wrong yet . There 's no word , though , on what those extras will be . . . but a good guess is that they 'll be the scenes cut from the film . <p> As soon as more info on this gets out we 'll , of course , be reporting on it . <p> Star Trek Monthly Interviews John EavesChristian ( 11:41 am CST ) The May 1999 issue of the British ' Star Trek Monthly Magazine ' contains an interview with TNG and DS9 Illustrator / Designer John Eaves , and the Great Link was kind enough to post the interview to the net . In it , he speaks about the Insurrection ships ( which he helped design ) , his work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series : <p> We keep hoping for a new Star Trek series , but we 're pretty much realising day by day that it 's just not going to happen right now , at least not while we 're all still here . So , everybody is a little melancholy about what to do next . I mean , do you go on to something else ? Do we starve ? Nobody knows for sure . So , we 're all kind of biting our nails . It 's kind of sad . I 've been here for four years and the family aspect of it is what I 've enjoyed the most . The show itself has been fun , too , but I 've rarely seen Deep Space Nine on the screen . We see episodes or parts of episodes eight or nine times in rough cut before you see them on television , and they always look pretty good . But , really , I 'll miss the guys the most . It 's kind of like the breaking up of a family . <p> Nana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Link has published an interview with Nana Visitor ( Kira Nerys ) that previously appeared in the May issue of the British ' Star Trek Monthly ' Magazine . In it , she admits she does n't really like the way the Odo/Kira relationship is developing : <p> Well , frankly , I do n't love the whole storyline . I kind of like the idea of a strong friendship remaining a friendship . Having us get together just reinforces the old idea that men and women ca n't be friends without something else happening . Kira and Odo were really deep friends . I think they probably could have remained just friends . Maybe deep friends ca n't just be friends , and maybe that 's the point the writers are trying to make and I 'm mistaken . After all , I married Sid , and he was my best friend . So , there you go ! <p> Even when she does n't like this particular plot development , she 's still very fond of the show , and is very sad to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uniform for the last show , the last scene , that that will be it , I assume that I 'll cry very hard and say good-bye to this character . I 've heard rumblings , as I 'm sure everyone else has , that some of us from Deep Space Nine might be involved in the next Next Generation movie or that we might eventually have a movie of our own . I just do n't see Deep Space Nine movies as a reality , but , if it actually happened , I would be thrilled . I think our entire company could rock on the big screen . I think we could really kick some butt . <p> In the full interview Nana Visitor goes on to talk about her experiences over the past 7 years , what she would have done had she been a writer for the show , and she discusses some memorable episodes . Go check it out ! <p> I had the opportunity to speak with Brannon Braga ( executive producer , Star Trek : Voyager ) about the rumored changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any comment on the record , I can say that he conceded that some changes are in store for Voyager 's writing staff . What exactly the nature of those changes are at this point , he is not able to make any comment . <p> TrekWeb 's report goes on to say they 've received some confirmations of the Ron Moore transfer , as well as a hint that his DS9 colleague Rene Echevarria may be moving over as well . Read more in the full report . <p> Daily Sci-Fi Previews Weekly Sci-FiChristian ( 11:15 am CST ) The Den 's Daily Sci-Fi has put up its weekly look at next week 's science-fiction television shows , including the new Voyager and Deep Space Nine offerings , ' Counterpoint ' and ' Til Death Do Us Part ' respectively . Teasers for these episodes , plus info on all the other major SF shows are also included in the preview , which can be found here . <p> T'Pel asks : I heard on the internet that recently Robbie McNeill had a little accident on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prop ? Did that really happen ? <p> Tim Russ : Yes , it did . It was a jet pack strapped to his back during the " Chaotica " episode . The special effects coordinator has often singed us in striving to create excitement in the scenes . Robbie is fine , but he will be , I 'm sure , a little more wary about doing that bit again . I think his words were " Never Again " <p> 3 of 5 asks : How do you feel about the cancelation of DS9 ? Do you think it will affect Voyager in any way ? <p> Tim Russ : I think a lot of the focus from the studios , networks and fans will be on our show as a result of DS9 's cancellation . Each one of these shows is planned to go a certain number of years and ours will probably run about the same time . I think it 's probably a good idea for the shows to end their run when they are the strongest . <p> Ruzena , Czech Republic asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed and it does not fit to your " vulcanese " face any longer . Why there does not exist a rule not to change dubbing , or does it ? <p> Tim Russ : Once the show has been completed , here at the studio and is sold ... overseas , it is completely out of out hands . That is the responsibility of the distributors in each country . I have seen only one other version of my character ... dubbed , and that was in Germany ... and it was very strange to see me with someone else 's voice coming out of my mouth . But these actors are hired to replace the dialogue very quickly and inexpensively ... they do no spend a great deal of time on the artistic aspect of portraying these characters . <p> Tim Russ certainly is right about the dubbing - when I 'm in Germany , I always try to catch a few Trek episodes , and there are few things more hilarious than hearing some of the German voices . Lots and lots more can be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UpChristian ( 11:14 am CST ) NOTE : This post contains minor spoilers for some of the DS9 episodes in the Final Chapter . If you want to avoid these spoilers , click here to move on to the next article . Nearly a month after the actual chat took place , the Continuum has finally put up the transcript of the chat with DS9 Visual Effects Producer Gary Hutzel . Looking at the transcript , it is fairly obvious why it was held back so long , as Hutzel provides us with some spoilers of Final Chapter plot elements . All of these have now already been officially confirmed by Paramount , so I guess they decided they could post this transcript as well . Take a look at some of the highlights from the chat : <p> Jonny asks : How do you create the calendar pictures in each year 's Star Trek offerings ? <p> Gary Hutzel : The calendar photos are photographed as four by five inch original transparencies elements and composited electronically in Photoshop . The high resolution output is used for the calendars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of buildings in Hollywood . No one was more surprised than me when it showed up on the side of a building . No one had said a word about it to me . When I photograph the miniature ships they must be shot as separate elements in order to appear as they do in the television series . A single photograph might have as many as seven separate elements . For instance , the so-called beauty pass is actually only the key light and fill light on the ship . With no additional lights . I will then photograph separately the engines , windows , nacelles , etc . This is so that each element will be correctly exposed and color-corrected for printing in the final composite . <p> Crom asks : Do you still film models or use al CGI ? <p> Gary Hutzel : Until the end of last season , I had exclusively photographed models for the show . At that time I began to develop an infrastructure for doing photographic quality computer generated ships . We are at this time just reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those techniques for the final battle sequences which will most certainly appear in our final episodes . <p> Just been confirming some things with Jeff Holzhauer . The game is still going gold on April 15th , and final work will be finished by 6PM on Wednesday . The master will then be made and sent to be duplicated on the 15th onwards . Everything 's going on scedule . The new official release date is the 25th of May , for the USA . Originally the UK and USA releases were meant to be simultaneous , but the US release date for the USA has been put back a week , so it may be out in the UK slightly earlier than the USA . <p> According to FedCom , the reason for this delay is to give publisher Hasbro the time to market the game . More on this can be found at FedCom , where you 'll also find info on what the development team is currently doing and some news on the Hotseat play option ( which does not exist ) . <p> The show 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirk actor to be the leader that has spoken through Harry for three and a half seasons . <p> In the hour-long episode , Shatner visits Earth to check on the progress of the aliens ' mission , only to wind up drinking to excess , trying to pick up chicks ( including Jane Curtin 's Mary ) , and demoting High Commander Dick Solomon ( John Lithgow ) . <p> In the full report members of the production crew go on to mention how extremely nice and down-to-earth Shatner was . You can find the full report here . <p> Wildstorm 's Trek Comics PlansChristian ( 11:12 am CST ) Michael Doran at AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine has put up an article looking at the plans of Wildstorm for the Star Trek comics line . Wildstorm recently obtained the Trek comic license through its parent company DC Comics , and currently plans to publish its first Trek comic in November . Readers may expect a slightly different format than before , according to the Mania article : <p> As to their early plans for the vast Trek universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarnations that have come before . " First off , we 're not planning to do any ongoing series , " explained the editor . " Star Trek episodes on TV have always been fairly well self-contained , although individual episodes reflect events from other episodes . So instead of having a long-running ongoing , we 're going to do a series of minis and prestige format one-shots , so no individual storyline will run more than 4 issues . " <p> The article also contains good news for fans of Pocket Books ' New Frontier series , as Wildstorm is actually considering publishing New Frontier comics as well : <p> Asked if fan-favorite Star Trek comics writer and novelist Peter David ( who is on public record as saying he 'd only probably be interested in comics based on his New Frontier series of novels ) would be considered , Mariotte responded , " Absolutely . Peter and I are talking . " <p> The full article goes on to talk about the writers that will be contacted and about possible tie-ins with Pocket Books - find it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CST ) Within a few days we 'll be putting in another re-design of the TrekToday main page . This time around , we 'll be removing some of the graphics at the top of the page to make room for more news , so that the page will load faster and you 'll be able to see the news a few seconds sooner . We do n't know how the site is going to look in the end , but I can guarantee you one thing - it 's going to look absolutely fantastic : - ) ! <p> Playmates has been teasing collectors for a year with a few photos of some beautiful 12 inch Classic STAR TREK alien figures , but up to now we 've had to settle with the ridiculously over-priced and somewhat unimpressive " Masterpiece Editions " of the original series 's Captain Kirk and TNG 's Jean Luc Picard . Now it looks like Playmates will actually be devoting most of their resources to a new line of 12 " action figures , with four sets of four standard release figures and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the STAR TREK fan club COMMUNICATOR magazine later this year . <p> If the first releases are any indicator , these figures should easily prove as popular among fans and collectors as Playmates ' nine inch line , which appears to be coming to an end this year . <p> Read more in the full review , in which Bond awards the figures with an ' A ' grade . <p> I 'm told that Paramount is considering a " wide " opening hundreds of theaters , as opposed to the usual dozen or so in major cities that would be appropriate for a documentary . Paramount publicity is telling me that nothing has been decided . <p> ... <p> The doc has played the festival circuit and was well-reviewed by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter . I do n't know how many disappointed Star Wars fans who ca n't get into showings of The Phantom Menace will be that anxious to see Trekkies , but Paramount 's ( alleged ) plan to open it in this fashion seems reasonably canny . <p> Reports are surfacing which say that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other things and Ron Moore was asked to transfer to Voyager - a move which Ron has denied online for months . But rumors place a Ron Moore/Voyager deal already in motion . Status of others ( Bryan Fuller , Joe Menosky , Rene Echevarria ( DS9 ) ) is still to be determined ( except Brannon Braga and Michael Taylor who will remain for sure ) . <p> For a while another paragraph was attached to this report , which mentioned that Brannon Braga had apparently said something at AOL along the lines of ' Good to have him aboard . ' This paragraph has now been removed , so I do n't know if Braga really said this . <p> Robbie 's short film , " The Battery , " was shown during the recent 1999 Newport Beach Film Festival and has been accepted at the Canyonlands Film Festival , which will be held in Moab , Utah , on the weekend of April 15 - April 19 , 1999 . While Robbie wo n't be able to attend the Canyonlands festival due to his previous commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Battery " will be shown during the festival and will compete for the festival prizes . For more information and ticketing , visit the festival website . <p> According to the fan club 's web site , ' The Battery ' was directed and co-written by Robert Duncan McNeill himself , who has been more and more active on the directorial front . More news on McNeill , including some upcoming convention dates , can be found at the RanDoM Flight news page . <p> I do n't know . Hollywood USA is a business . Star Trek is very big business for Paramount Pictures . So if the film is successful , then there will be another one . It is approaching that we 're all getting a bit long in the tooth to keep doing these . I wish we were all 15 years younger and could keep doing a whole slew of them . But we did do a whole slew of them on television . <p> I do n't think we have much time left . I do n't . I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotient is out the window . I do n't think I would be believable in the character . for very much longer . <p> I actually called Rick Berman before they wrote the script and asked him , Why do n't we kill Data off in this one ? He said why ? I said well one , it 's bound to make an interesting scene in the movie . It will have value on that level . Two , Paramount does n't have to negotiate with me anymore . Which I 'm sure would make them happy . Because it does get increasingly difficult . It ' s always about establishing what you think you 're value is as opposed to what they think your value is . You push it as far as you can and their idea of what your value is changes . But it 's a necessary evil of this kind of deal . It 's not fun for anyone . So I said they wo n't have to go through that again . Thirdly , you wo n't get into a situation where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to do it then your stuck having to rewrite . <p> Well he said that he was going into a meeting with the executives from Paramount and the writer . I ' ll let you know . A few weeks later , I get a script in the mail . On the script there is a card with Rick Berman on it and it said , " Sorry , Kill you next time . " <p> There 's a lot more in the full interview , in which Spiner goes on to mention that he 'd love to be able to do more movies , but that it simply would n't be believable anymore . Fascinating reading . Major thanks go out to Welcome , Brent Spiner Fans ! for pointing me to this . <p> Minor Nog SpoilersChristian ( 1:33 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains very minor spoilers about the character of Nog on Deep Space Nine . Personally I 'd say you can probably read these spoilers , but if you really want to avoid it click here to be transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting news from Jason Chappel about a possible promotion for Nog : <p> I received word from my cousin who is working on a new paramount movie , that Nog will be made a Lieutenant . My uncle was walking around the Paramount lot on his lunch break , when he saw Aron Eisenberg standing outside Stage 18 , wearing his " ears " and wearing a new set of pips . <p> Considering the size of these pips , I do wonder how he was actually able to see this ... let 's hope for Nog he had his glasses on . <p> " Think Tank " is a fairly enjoyable hour that 's halfway effective , but shows Voyager making compromises with itself . It reveals a surprising amount about what works about this series and what does n't . <p> This episode works as a reasonable TOS-like entertainment that pushes the buttons on the control panel labeled " ESTABLISHED PLOTTING LORE , " and comes off as something watchable . Where the episode suffers is in its use of so many plot elements that are n't developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper for something more challenging , which is ironic considering one of the episode 's main themes is about seeking out challenges . <p> In the end , he awards the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars - find his full reasons for that here . <p> A new edition of the weekly Sev Trek competition has just gone up at the Sev Wide Web : <p> The Fungi Rules of Acquisition This week is a little different - there will be multiple winners as YOU write the Fungi Rules of Acquisition !

' Even though she finds some parts of the episode rather hard to believe , in general she really likes the episode : <p> So , right off : about Worf and Ezri . I do n't buy it . Not in this galaxy or any other one , not for a second . I want to . But I do n't . <p> That said , let 's rewind . Here we have the beginning of what is to be " DS9 's " last arc , and it drops plenty of excellent hints ( well , maybe not " hints " if you 've read the spoilers ) as to what 's going to happen . I appreciate that they 're allowing the story to unfold slowly , in the grandiose style of one of my favorite arcs of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots more can be found in the full review , in which Kuhn awards the episode 4 out of 5 stars . <p> Robert Picardo Real VideoChristian ( 11:25 am CST ) The Star Trek Universe is reporting that the ' Air and Space Channel ' have a video interview with Robert Picardo ( Holodoc ) online . The Real Video interview ( which is only available live , and not for download ) is split into two parts - in one he 's talking to the audience , and in the other he 's being interviewed . In the videos , Picardo talks about his role on Voyager and about some of the technology Star Trek is using . More on this , including links to the 56k6 versions of the videos , can be found by going here and scrolling down somewhat . <p> Viacom Launching Science-Fiction ChannelChristian ( 11:25 am CST ) A Reuters/Variety report written by Richard Katz and Laura Freeman mentions that Viacom , parent company of Paramount , will soon be launching its own science-fiction television channel : <p> Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise , Thursday mentioned plans to launch a cable network to compete against the Sci-Fi Channel . Our sci-fi channel will consist of real , true sci-fi , not horror , ' ' Redstone said , a jab at Sci-Fi , which also airs fantasy and horror fare . <p> Viacom 's Paramount division certainly has produced plenty of attractive sci-fi programming . However , its original Star Trek ' ' as well as The Twilight Zone ' ' have been sold to Sci-Fi Channel until at least 2004 . Viacom , however , has not sold the rerun rights to its three newer Star Trek ' ' spinoffs , The Next Generation , ' ' Deep Space Nine ' ' and Voyager . ' ' <p> Redstone also said that contractual obligations forbid them from launching a sci-fi service until after fall of 2001 , but that they would introduce their sci-fi station within the next few years . Coincidentally , Voyager will probably end its run early 2001 , so perhaps Viacom 's new sci-fi service will be launched together with a Trek Series V. <p> More on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some comments from a Viacom spokesperson who denies that the company has any definite plans yet , and some statements from the Sci-Fi Channel 's management . <p> " Chrysalis " started this run of reruns in less than convincing fashion , earning a 3.5 rating , tying with " Image In the Sand " as the lowest rerun rating of the year . That 's also down quite a bit from last year 's 4.6 rerun rating for " Favor the Bold . " Xena and Hercules , also in reruns , both defeated DS9 on the week . Xena was the top syndie drama with a 3.9 , Hercules trailed with a 3.7 . <p> The ratings for ' Treachery , Faith and the Great River ' were more of a surprise - and not a good one : <p> " Treachery , Faith , and the Great River " stayed flat from last week , equaling the mark of " Chrysalis , " a 3.5 . That ties with " Image in the Sand " and " Chrysalis " as the lowest-rated rerun of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sacrifice of Angels , " which nabbed a 4.6 . <p> ... <p> This mark could have been higher , especially considering the fact that " Treachery ... " was the highest-rated firstrun episode this year . However , the 3.5 mark is n't a disaster , and the next two episodes should at least hold that mark , perhaps improve it . <p> " Infinite Regress " started this next burst of reruns with a whimper , earning a 3.3 rating , 5 share . That 's one of the lowest overnight ratings this season and a bit lower than the last couple reruns . <p> As would be expected , Voyager finished 6th in its timeslot , behind the other networks ' mostly firstrun episodes . The WB 's " Charmed " was the closest at a 6.4/10 . It is possible that Fox 's special on sexy commercials ( 9.1/14 ) drained some of Voyager 's audience -- they do target the same demographic . <p> Fortunately , according to the full report , not all hope may yet be lost . Find out why in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am CST ) -At 17:00 GMT , British television station Sky One will be showing Voyager 's ' Before &amp; After .

No less than 8 new sites were submitted yesterday , including the following three sites : <p> -The Julian/Ezri Relationshippers is the first site dedicated to the relationship of Dr. Julian Bashir and Lt. Ezri Dax of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . -The Starship Design Bureau is a web site with information on how to edit Birth of the Federation , Microprose 's upcoming turn-based strategy game . -Pete 's Star Trek for Dummies is a Trek site containing the history of each series and movie . With pics , sounds , and a starship registry . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:23 am CST ) Well , I indeed was n't able to complete yesterday 's news update , but the reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my ISP simply decided to break down in the middle of my update . As promised , today I 'll be posting all the news I was n't able to post yesterday , so you wo n't be missing out on anything : - ) . <p> Thursday April 8 , 1999 <p> Tim Russ Chat TonightChristian ( 1:40 pm CST ) As a reminder , the Continuum will be hosting a chat with Tim Russ ( Tuvok ) this evening at 06:30pm Pacific Time . In the chat , you 'll be able to ask him questions about ' life as a Vulcan on Star Trek:Voyager , ' but he 'll probably answer other questions as well . Detailed info on how to participate can be found here , while you also have the chance to submit advance questions . <p> Delta Blues Not Shutting DownChristian ( 1:36 pm CST ) A few days ago , the April issue of the Starfleet Journal newsletter was published . The newsletter also contained a new edition of ' Notes from Sandrine 's Bar , ' the column of Jim Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached by a Paramount representative ( April Poole ) , who had ordered him to remove his reviews from his Delta Blues web site . <p> If you did n't get that this was an April Fools joke ( perhaps because the column did n't go online until a few days after the 1st of April ) , a few days ago Jim put up the following notice at the Delta Blues site : <p> Yes , it is an April Fools column . Do not send outraged letters to Paramount , UPN , Viacom , or anyone associated with the letters TPTB . I am NOT being shut down . Direct all flames my way . Chalk it up to my 35th birthday , a nasty flu and a 24-hour case of terminal adolescence . All the same , I 'm pretty darn pleased with how it turned out . ( Reaction has ranged from " Not Funny " to " one of the best pranks I 've ever seen . " Take a look and decide for yourself . ) <p> No less than 3 people sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also post this explanation here on the site . Meanwhile , the original column that caused all the trouble can be found by going here , while Delta Blues can still be found here . <p> UPN Hacks OnChristian ( 1:00 pm CST ) Apparently UPN does n't seem to mind all the publicity , as the station is still continuing their Voyager hack job - yesterday 's repeat of ' Infinite Regress ' had another few minutes removed , according to Vidiot 's report : <p> Note : the original airing was only 45:20 in length . It was 30 seconds shorter because of the Star Trek : Insurrection behind-the-scenes piece . This was a tough one to figure out , because of pieces that were restored and the pieces that were removed . My guess is that they actually edited a full 45:50 version . UPN had a chance to restore the original length , but instead they $#% ( @ it . The fans get screwed yet a second time with this episode . <p> In the end , UPN removed 1 minute and 45 seconds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 seconds . A detailed breakdown can be found in Vidiot 's full report . <p> First up , I have ( literally ) just received the script to the final episode of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . <p> Glen goes on to say that he has n't actually read the script yet , but that he can provide us with some info on what *won't* be in the DS9 finale : <p> No Enterprise-E appears in the finale . There is a space battle which could , in theory , incorporate the ship - but no Enterprise-E characters ( other than DS9 series regular Worf ) appear in the script , and there is no specification that the Enterprise-E makes an appearance in any way . <p> No Gowron . <p> No Spock . <p> No Sloane ( although there is a reference to Section 31 ) . <p> Considering that , according to what is currently thought to happen , Gowron and Sloane will be dealt with in episodes taking place before the finale , some of this is n't all that surprising . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have liked a small cameo appearance . The full report also contains a list of characters who *will* be in the DS9 finale ( including Morn ! Hurrah ! ) - find it all here . <p> 1 . From the IE 5.0 menu , select Tools , Internet Options , General , then click the Languages button . 2 . Click the Add button . 3 .

Click the Search button on the tool bar and examine the new options in the Search pane . 7 . Click the radio button next to " Find Yourself " and then perform a search . <p> I 'm not telling you exactly what the easter egg is , you 'll have to find that out for yourself . I *can* say , however , that it 's absolutely wonderful and you definitely have to give it a try ! <p> ' Dr. Soran ' Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reporting that Malcolm McDowell ( Dr. Tolian Soran , ' Generations ' ) has joined the cast of ' The Visitors , ' a remake of the French science fiction film Les Visiteurs . In the movie , McDowell will play the part of a wizard , according to the article . The movie will start shooting later this month in Chicago and in the United Kingdom . <p> As a former Paramount employee , I was there when Voyager and ST:First Contact were launched and saw first-hand the confusion at how something that premieres with such powerful numbers can drop so far so fast . The simple truth is two-fold : <p> 1 . The once " Holy Franchise " is not itself tired . However , those who run the show are creatively burnt out and are also no longer on the cutting-edge of Sci-fi . Furthermore , they have lost touch with their core audience and have failed to recognize that this same audience has not only become increasingly sophisticated , but has ever-rising expectations . The problem with replacing them is that the forces behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration at the studio that replacing them is very , very difficult . After all , it 's not easy to fire your friends , people whose kid 's birthday parties you bring your kids to on a regular basis . <p> This ' insider ' also goes on to mention that the producers fail to see they 're quickly becoming an anachronism , as , in a few years , ' 3 kids working out of their parents garage ' will be able to take over from them and produce the next high-quality science-fiction epic . A bit more from this obviously unbiased *former* Paramount employee can be found by going here . <p> I watched this show with a sense of foreboding and loss , knowing that it 's the beginning of the end for this series and probably for some of these characters . It was superb : considering that my favorite DS9 characters are Kira and Odo and we barely saw them for a minute , I was surprised at how powerful I found " Penumbra . " <p> The full review contains mroe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a detailed synopsis of the episode . <p> What do you get when you cross Master of Orion II and Star Trek ? Thankfully , not a disappointing muddle like Star Trek Generations , MicroProse 's last foray into the Star Trek universe . On this voyage , the developer has steered the right course ; players can look forward to its promising turn-based strategy game Star Trek : The Next Generation--Birth of the Federation , shipping late this May for the PC and in June for the Mac . <p> Admirably , after weathering a two-year development cycle and MicroProse 's buyout by Hasbro Interactive , Birth of the Federation has not lost its focus . We recently put a late beta to the test , and we can safely say it still promises Next Generation fans a dose of deep strategy in the context of their favorite universe . <p> Official DS9 Finale Press ReleaseChristian ( 11:24 am CST ) Paramount has just issued an official press release which talks about the upcoming end of DS9 , and also confirms ' What You Leave Behind ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : DEEP SPACE NINE , the #1 first-run drama series in national syndication , ends its highly successful seven-year run with the filming of a two-hour final episode entitled What You Leave Behind .

What You Leave Behind , ' ' written by Ira Steven Behr and Hans Beimler and directed by Allan Kroeker , will air the week of May 31 , 1999 . <p> ... <p> Executive Producer Ira Steven Behr says , There will be closure of the story arcs for all nine main characters , as well as for the over 20 guest stars that will appear in the episode . Additionally , viewers can expect one of the biggest special effects sequences the show has ever done . ' ' <p> The rest of the press release goes on to talk about the show 's history , and also has a remarkable quote from Rick Berman in which he says that they ' had always intended to tell the story of DEEP SPACE NINE in the span of seven years ' - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:23 am CST ) Sorry for the rather late start - I do n't have much time today , and I 'm not even sure if I 'll be able to finish a complete update . If not , I 'll see if I have the time to add another short update tomorrow morning , if not , I 'll make it up in tomorrow 's regular update again . <p> Wednesday April 7 , 1999 <p> DS9 Final Chapter Spoilers At SF WorldChristian ( 1:10 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains huge ( *H*U*G*E* ) spoilers for DS9 's Final Chapter - you probably want to avoid them and still be able to enjoy the episode . Click here to do exactly that and move on to the next article . <p> Final warning - click here to be transported to the next news item and avoid these spoilers . <p> Once again , Sci-Fi World has posted very major spoilers for most of the episodes in DS9 's Final Chapter . As there are simply so immensely many spoilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important ones : <p> In ' Eclipse , ' the third Final Chapter episode , the leader of the Breen ( ' Thot Gor ' ) and the Female Changeling begin preparations to sign an alliance . Damar objects to this , as concessions made to the Breen may end up harming Cardassia . Meanwhile , Kai Winn and Anjhol ( Dukat in disguise ) pledge to restore Bajor , even if the Emissary stands in their way . <p> In ' Tacking Into the Wind , ' the sixth Final Chapter episode , Gowron and Martok get into an argument , as Martok believes Gowron 's strategies are too risky . Worf agrees with Martok , and challenges Gowron to a fight , after which Martok is named Chancellor . Meanwhile , Kira and Garak are helping Damar with his resistance movement , while Odo is suffering more and more from the Changeling disease ( though he tries to keep it hidden from his friends ) . <p> In ' Night Tremors , ' the 7th Final Chapter episode , Bashir and O'Brien lure Section 31 director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a cure for the Changeling disease for Odo . <p> In the penultimate Final Chapter episode , ' The Dogs Of War , ' the new Defiant arrives ( the old one was destroyed by the Breen . ) The Cardassian resistance movement grows in support , though they 're being hunted by the Dominion and the Breen . Sisko is plagued in many ways - he learns that Kassidy Yates is pregnant , and he has to launch a major offensive against the Dominion . <p> As I said , this is just a tiny portion of what 's available - get all the info at Sci-Fi World . <p> Trek Gaming Alliance OpensChristian ( 12:52 pm CST ) TDawg sends along word that the Trek Gaming Alliance has finally opened . The site is aiming to be the only Trek gaming site you 'll ever need to visit , offering discussion boards , a Trek store , and daily updated news on everything dealing with Trek gaming news . I can certainly recommend the site to everyone - the Trek Gaming Alliance is probably going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clicking here - you wo n't be disappointed ! <p> " It 's pretty dismal around here , " one UPN staffer anonymously confided in me a few weeks ago . " We do n't know if we 'll have a job for much longer . " This feeling was n't helped recently when producer Colombia / Tristar asked UPN for a guarantee that the network would stay in business . The network refused and everyone started talking . It 's not unusual for a network to ask for a guarantee from a producer but the opposite is virtually unheard of . UPN has said that the request was n't necessary . <p> ... <p> Affiliates are moving or dropping UPN programming in favor of higher rated syndicated fare such as Xena or even Baywatch . With rival network The WB and Bud Paxson 's new PaxNet making offers to independent stations as well , it 's become time for UPN to put up to shut up , literally . <p> Of course , as the article mentions , the Voyager hacking is n't a sign of a healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . Thanks go out to Vidiot 's site itself for the link . <p> " Think Tank " rebounded from last week 's disaster , bringing Voyager back to right around its season average , earning a 3.7 rating , 6 share . That 's up 22% from last week 's " The Fight , " Voyager 's lowest-rated episode ever to air . Last year 's episode airing this week was a rerun , but " Think Tank " easily defeated the episode from last season airing nearest to this week , " Vis a Vis , " which only mustered up a 3.1 . <p> Of course , this might have something to do with the Jason Alexander guest appearance , but these ratings are still encouraging . Find more in the full report . <p> Unsuprisingly , every episode in this period was off from the previous year , some by quite a bit . The closest DS9 came to a season 6 mark was " Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang , " which was off by a still fairly hefty 11% . The top episode of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which like " Who Mourns for Morn ? " last year , opened the month with a strong comedy performance . <p> ... <p> On the season , DS9 has taken a lead of .05 of a rating point over Xena , with Hercules trailing far more , down in third . Despite the lead , this month did have quite a few dark spots . Both " Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang , " and " Field of Fire " tied the all-time low mark for DS9 set by " The Sound of Her Voice " and " Tears of the Prophets " last year . <p> Deep Space Nine did take over the #1 syndicated drama spot , but , unfortunately , the only reason for this is that its two main competitors did even worse than DS9 . In any case , a full analysis of DS9 's ratings , including detailed comparisons with last year , can be found by clicking here . <p> Star Trek : Thirty Years and Beyond , the 1996 TV special hosted by Ted Danson with the largest assembly of Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek : The Real Story are both available on that date for $14.95 suggested retail .

According to the article , she certainly has been keeping herself busy since her role on Voyager ended : <p> The actress has been very busy in the months since she last appeared on the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. 's prestigious Arena Stage , playing a role in the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy Never Been Kissed , which opens this month - not to mention taking care of the baby with whom she was pregnant when she appeared on the show . <p> Even though all these roles have been a lot of fun for her , in the interview she says that she 'd love to come back on Voyager . As a matter of fact , until a few days before the episode where she died started filiming , she nearly would n't have had to leave at all ! <p> In the original draft of " Basics " - the two-part episode which ended the second season of Voyager and launched the third - the plan was to keep Seska around while Kazon nemesis Culluh paid the ultimate price for challenging Janeway . But during the transition over hiatus , when executive producer Michael Piller stepped down and Jeri Taylor took over his role , a decision was made to take the series in another direction . Seska was killed when Janeway 's allies reclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series was finished . <p> ... <p> The rumor from Paramount at the time was that Taylor wanted to get rid of Piller 's Kazon arc as quickly as possible because it was n't popular with viewers , but in doing so , much of the drama which had been built during the second season was erased . <p> This is n't the only problem Hackett sees with Voyager , but to hear more about that , you 'll have to read the full article , written by Michelle Erica Green In it , Hackett also talks about her experiences in the first several Voyager seasons , her more recent projects , and her fans . Check it out here . <p> The actual tactical play was great . The few SFB grognards I discussed this with looked askance at me when I told them it had been converted to real-time . But it works , in my opinion . They 've worked hard to hold onto the SFB " feel " and the conversion to real-time only improves the game by eliminating the " end of turn fire everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boardgame ) - something that might surprise some given the ability of a computer to handle the mathematical chores . However , the SFB system is complex enough to be entertaining without this additional difficult " chrome " . Anyone who played the boardgame probably tried some kludgy house rule to play in the 3rd dimension , and more frequently than not , it ended with people getting bored without any real addition to gameplay . ( For that matter , in the media they really only remembered the Z-axis once anyway in the Wrath of Khan . So it 's no big loss ! ) <p> The rest of the preview contains a look at the game 's history , its graphics , and even has several screenshots for you to look at . You can find it all here , and thanks go out to Evil Avatar for pointing me to this . <p> ' Christmas Carol ' Cast Christian ( 11:17 am CST ) Cinescape Online has just put up a short article in which details of the ' Christmas Carol ' cast are presented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater show wrapped several weeks ago , only now do we get to hear who 's actually in it : <p> In addition to Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge , Richard E.

Christian ( 11:15 am CST ) Yesterday , I put up a small report about Mr. Vidiot 's ' Till Death Do Us Part ' trailer , which he 'd just made available . In the report , I said that ' even though the trailer was available at Star Trek Interactive ! a few days ago already , Vidiot 's trailers are usually of a somewhat higher quality . <p> A few hours later , I received an e-mail from David , the Star Trek Interactive ! webmaster , who asked me what I found wrong with his videos . After giving the matter some thought , I think I owe David an apology , as I also think his site is an excellent one . Even though the image quality of Vidiot 's trailers is , in my opinion , slightly higher , STI 's trailers are definitily worth checking out as well . For one thing , they 're usually available a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interactive ! can certainly be accessed more often than Vidiot 's site , which seems to be down more than half of the time . <p> In the end , both are excellent sites , and I recommend visiting them both . If your goal is to see the new trailers as soon as possible , I 'd say Star Trek Interactive ! is your best bet , while if you can wait a few days and would like to get videos with a somewhat higher quality , you probably should go for Vidiot . <p> UPN is boldly going into " Star Trek : Voyager " and slashing two minutes from each episode - in order to appease angry advertisers , a " Voyager " Internet website is charging . <p> Vidiot.com , devoted to all things " Voyager , " says it assumes that UPN is using those two minutes to air free commercials owed to advertisers because " Voyager " has failed to reach certain promised ratings levels - a practice known in advertising circles as " make-goods . " <p> In the rest of the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discovery , while UPN also comments on the matter : <p> " We have no more commercial inventory than any other network , " said a UPN spokesman . One insider said the missing footage is due to shows " that come in short " and fail to meet their 45-minute length - a common problem for all six broadcast networks . <p> As the full article already mentions , this obviously does not apply to Voyager repeats , which have also been cut down . Thanks go out to Mr. Video Productions for pointing me to this - I 'm sure Mr. Vidiot will soon post extra info on this as well . <p> I really need to create some kind of macro for these spoiler posts ... it seems as if not a day goes by without one . Anyways , click here to move on to the next news item and avoid the spoilers . <p> Mr. Video Productions has just posted the official Paramount press release for the upcoming DS9 episode ' The Changing Face of Evil . ' The press release contains a *very* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ezri 's safe return is tempered by reports that the Breen have attacked Starfleet Headquarters on Earth . While Dominion and Breen commanders exult in their sneak attack , their supposed ally - Cardassian leader Damar - secretly plots to free his homeland from Dominion occupation .

Apparently the people at the Den 's Daily Sci-Fi also read about that news tidbit , as they 've just published a small article looking at the chances of the next Trek movie : <p> If we go by the timeline , the earliest possible date to start a movie would be around 2001 , once Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two for filming and post-production , and we 're in 2003 before you see the Enterprise-E on the big screen again ( if rumors are true , you will be seeing it again for the last episode of Deep Space Nine ) . If the Trek crew must be delayed even further , then we may not see another Trek film until after 2005 , after the last Star Wars movie comes out ( that is , if the new Star Wars films are as good as we hope they are ) . <p> Maybe it 's all for the best . If absence makes the heart grow fonder , then a couple years absence from the box office could make fans all the more rabid to see it when it finally arrives . <p> More on this ( including the original Frakes statements ) can be found by going here and reading the full article . <p> Trek CCG Tournament Dates AnnouncedChristian ( 11:10 am CST ) Decipher , the company behind the Star Trek Customizable Card Game , has just announced the approximate dates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Invitational championships are actually a new thing this year , according to the Decipher site : <p> New to this year 's qualification system are the Invitational Championships .

The episode airs at 7:00pm GMT Eastern Time , and is repeated at 11:00pm . <p> -British television station Sky One will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 23:30 GMT . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 11:03 am CST ) Absolutely incredible for a Monday , we had no less than 6 site submissions yesterday at TrekSeek , bringing us to a total of 931 Star Trek links . A small selection of those new sites : <p> -The Sci-Fi Mall is the center of the Science Fiction Shopping Universe . It sells Star Trek &amp; Star Wars collectibles , and has Sci-Fi news and links . -The USS Justice NCC-556 is a Star Trek and sci-fi fan club located in the Morris County , New Jersey area . Their chapter is a part of the organization known as Starfleet International . Their membership partakes in many different sci-fi and fantasy events , as well as other completely non-related events that they find enjoyable . -Trekkies Mail offers a free @trekkies.zzn.com Email account for Star Trek fans . <p> All the other new sites that were added yesterday can , of course , be found here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:03 am CST ) As of today , I 'll start posting the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / 11:00pm CST . The reason for this is *not* that I 'm a lazy bum and want to play SimCity 3000 for an extra hour , but rather that several people have been complaining about visiting the site only to see ' Hello World ! ' and nothing else . After giving the matter some thought , I 've realized that you people are actually very much right about this , so I 've decided to first gather some news , and then post several updates in a row . This should make sure that you will always be greeted by a healthy amount of news , making sure your TrekToday visit is never a pointless one anymore : - ) ! <p> Please remember that these rumors are just that - rumors . A lot of them have been fabricated so viewers phone a premium rate phone line . We recommend checking TrekToday peridoically ( how about every day ? : - ) ) for confirmed news . <p> Takei Starring In Simpsons Season EnderChristian ( 1:49 pm CST ) AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz is reporting that George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finale of ' The Simpsons . ' In the episode , the Simpsons family travels to Tokyo , where they 'll undoubtedly be greeted by Takei 's character . The episode airs on May 16 at Fox , the same day the current X-Files season will end . Take a look at the original article for more on this . <p> Regular Cinescape contributor Michael Marek returns with his detailed , SPOILER-packed looks at an upcoming episode of Star Trek : DS9 , this time for " Penumbra . " Mike does n't hold back on the specifics of what 's coming , so if you would rather not know what lies ahead on DS9 , move on to the next story . For those of you who ca n't wait , click here . You have been warned ! <p> What more can I add to this ? A detailed synopsis of the episode can be found here , usual spoiler warnings apply . <p> Another warning : the below post summarizes the events in DS9 's Penumbra - there wo n't be many surprises left if you continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . Arman re-posted a first review of DS9 's ' Penumbra ' to the Trekweb Message Board . The review was originally posted by ' STFC WAH ' at AOL , and describes what happens in this first episode of DS9 's Final Chapter : <p> 1 . This is obviously a set-up for the episodes to follow with several major storylines developing at the same time . Maybe it is just me , but I like that . : ) <p> 2 . Worf disappears when the ship he is commanding is attacked . We get to hear Jadzia 's voice as Ezri walks around Worf 's quarters and she remembers several conversations between Ezri and Jadzia . Ezri decides to take a runabout and search for Worf when the Jem'Hadar force the Defiant to cut off the search . She uses pretty good logic to find him , and there are tense moments as the two of them FINALLY have to share the same space together . When the Jem'Hadar locate the runabout on its way home and attacks , Worf beams the two of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart " ) and they must spend the night together in the jungle . True to Worf , the two get into an argument , the embrace and kiss each other . They wake up the next morning with Worf 's hands on her shoulders . As they begin to wake up , they are surprised by two Breens , who shoot them with their weapons , knocking them unconscious . They wake up in a cell on a Breen ship , their future uncertain . Hey , it 's not easy bein ' Breen ... <p> Undoubtedly you 're wondering what the rest of the episode contains , and you 'll be able to read this in the full review . <p> Query from : Jim McCain How about some hints for 2000 and 2001 since that is what you are working on ? <p> Response from : John Ordover The only thing I can totally confirm for 2000 is the Dark Matters Voyager trilogy by Christie Golden -- three book series that deals with the return of the Romluan scientist from EYE OF THE NEEDLE - and oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From the initial reaction , I think I might be in the minority on this one . I thought it was potentially pretty interesting , but the execution did n't do much for me . <p> I had the same problem with this that I had with " Bliss . " The teaser killed the suspense for me . We learned at the outset what the Think Tank is capable of , so when Kurros came to Janeway knowing as much as he did about the Hazari Paradox , my first suspicion was that Kurros had hired the Hazari . Nothing in the interim caused me to question that , and nothing prompted me to feel any better about Kurros or his motley band of traveling problem-solvers . All in all , I found the episode interesting , but I had virtually no emotional connection with it . <p> As usual , an enourmous synopsis and a lengthy analysis of the episode can be found in the full review . <p> The end of Star Trek : The Next Generation was kind of bogus , because it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies . This is an END . Obviously , Deep Space Nine has evolved over the years . The characters have deepened , the relationships have deepened , the story arcs have deepened . But I think what we 're proudest of is that there was a two-hour pilot called " Emissary " which laid out a lot of pipe , a lot of possibilities , for the audience and the people working on the show . <p> ... <p> So I think the show has evolved from the pilot . And the last episode will be , in some ways - with all the zig-zagging we 've done - a direct arrow 's flight from the pilot to the finale . That gives us joy . We 're definitely connecting the dots . In fact , I 've got to keep rubbing my eyes from the strain of connecting all of these dots . <p> A little bit more of the interview can be found by going here . Thanks go out to Warp 11 for the above picture . <p> #14 Star Trek : The Next Generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SF " ) <p> Unfortunately , Voyager did not make it into the top 50 , but the magazine did award Gene Roddenberry 's ' Earth : Final Conflict ' with a 40th place .

Inside the magazine , there 's a huge ' Wonder Women ' feature , a very large excerpt of which is also available on the TV Guide web site : <p> What happens when the Queen of Sword and Sorcery meets the Queen of Outer Space ? It turns out that Lucy Lawless , who plays the title role in the syndicated hit Xena : Warrior Princess , and Jeri Ryan , the part-Borg , part-human Seven of Nine on UPN 's Star Trek : Voyager , have more in common than their bodacious , butt-kicking characters : Both are strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix work and motherhood . <p> This is followed by a large interview in which , as TV Guide says , the two women talk about ' sex , feminism and their lesbian fans : ' <p> Ryan : There was a big petition on the Internet to have Seven be the first lesbian regular on Star Trek . Then somebody issued a fake press release announcing it was going to happen . Then all the fans got disappointed when it did n't . Well , not everyone . I do n't know that mainstream America is ready for it . But who knows ? My character is exploring all aspects of humanityand sexuality is certainly one of those aspectsso it would n't surprise me if lesbianism is touched on . Seven would be the obvious character to explore it with . Our show is about acceptance and shedding prejudice . <p> From the first time I saw it , I thought the Star Wars Monopoly game was a great idea . ... However , I felt a frisson of fear at the discovery of the Star Trek : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practically the antithesis of the Federation ! Could a TNG player be reduced to paying cash to the Cardassians in order to keep Bajor free ? Would one have to choose between buying Vulcan or saving the money to build hotels on Risa ? The horror ! Then again , the idea of owning Angel One - that planet where women rule over scantily-clad men - does have a certain appeal . <p> In the end , she concludes that the Monopoly game is actually worth the $50 you 'll have to pay for it , especially if you 're a die-hard Trek fan . Her full description and review of the Monopoly game can be found by going here , which is , of course , where you 'll also be able to buy it directly from Mania .

Christian ( 10:42 am CST ) This week , the first Final Chapter episode ( ' Penumbra ' ) will be shown , and has been shown in some places already . Even though it 'll still be another year or so before I finally get to see the episode ( as I live in Europe ) , this does make me very sad . I 've always considered DS9 to be the best Trek series around , and I 'll certainly miss it when it 's gone . Let 's hope the Final Chapter turns out to be absolutely wonderful - the series deserves no less . <p> Sunday April 4 , 1999 <p> New DS9 Final Chapter SpoilersChristian ( 1:37 pm CST ) NOTE : This post contains spoilers for DS9 's Final Chapter . If you do not want to have your viewing pleasure spoiled , or if you are simply fed up with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next article . <p> Over the past few days , several sources ( including Trekweb and Sci-Fi World ) have been reporting that the Defiant will be destroyed at some point in DS9 's Final Chapter , probably in the episode ' The Dogs Of War . ' However , according to the latest edition of the Secured Channel , this may actually be untrue : <p> A source of TSCN 's has informed me that the Defiant wo n't actually be destroyed ! But , she will be hurt . There 's been a rumor floating around on the internet for awhile regarding the possible destruction of the Defiant in one of the final episodes of DS9 . A source of TSCN who does some work for Paramount told me the following : ' The Defiant was going to be heavily damaged with the possibility of major repairs , maybe even a slightly uprated model ' . <p> More can be found in the full issue , but , once again , this is also just a rumour , and has n't been officially confirmed yet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About a week ago we reported on the chances of a DS9 finale novelization , which did n't seem to be very good . Last week Friday , the people at Pocket Books had n't yet received a final shooting script , and , with the deadline of the novelization approaching , it seemed as if writer Diane Carey would n't be able to finish the novelization in time . Fortunately , today Pocket Books editor John Ordover said the following at his Q&amp;A Board : <p> As of this writing , things are looking up for being able to publish the DS9 finale novelization ( which was always a scheduling question , not a motivation question ) , but that 's as much as I can say at the moment . <p> In the full update Ordover also talks about the upcoming Double Helix six-parter , which will be published this summer . <p> The Secured Channel Issue 17 AppearsChristian ( 11:49 am CST ) Daryus Aden has just sent out issue 17 of the Secured Channel , the bi-weekly Star Trek newsletter , and , as of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Hi all , The upgrade to our new mail server is complete - TSCN is now using the majordomo hosted at Trekzone.net .

If you do not want to read these spoilers , click here to avoid them and scroll down to the next news item . <p> Sci-Fi World has received new info on most of the Final Chapter episodes . Take a look : <p> In ' Umbra , ' the second episode of the Final Chapter , Ezri Dax admits that she really loves Julian Bashir , and not Worf .

Moreover , the Defiant is destroyed by the Breen , and Damar declares Cardassia to be under Dominion occupation . <p> In ' When It Rains ...

They 're presumably still busy with that in ' Night Tremors , ' the next episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The site also mentions that in the 8th episode of the Final Chapter , ' The Dogs Of War , ' the new Defiant will arrive at Deep Space Nine , which will undoubtedly help to achieve victory over the Dominion .

Do still keep in mind , though , that these are still rumours , and they have n't been officially confirmed yet . <p> German Trek Index NewsChristian ( 11:06 am CST ) The German Star Trek Index has a new edition up of ' DSi Aktuell , ' the information bulletin about the Index itself .

Only proceed if you actually want to read these spoilers , if not , click here to go on to the next news item . <p> Yesterday , Alex Peckover at the Sci-Fi World posted some new info on DS9 's Final Chapter . Alex notes that , even though he received the info on April Fools Day , they arrived from a reliable source , so they could very well be true . Take a look at the new info : <p> In the sixth episode of the Final Chapter , ' Tacking Into the Wind , ' Worf challenges Gowron to a fight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the official Robert O'Reilly ( Gowron ) fan club , although they mentioned Gowron would be killed in the series finale . <p> In the 7th episode of the Final Chapter , ' Night Tremors , ' Kira and Garak are assigned to aid Damar in creating an anti-Dominion Cardassian resistance movement . <p> In the final episode , ' What You Leave Behind , ' the Breen do indeed join the Dominion , and destroy the Defiant with a powerful new weapon . However , DS9 is assigned the USS Defiant NCC-74205-A . <p> Most of these news bits seem to confirm other rumours already floating around the Net , so they appear to be reliable ( or a very elaborate fabrication , that would also be possible , of course : - ) . Take a look at the full update for more , but do keep in mind that these are still just rumours , and they have n't been officially confirmed yet . <p> Do n't hold your breath ( or start lining up ) for the next Star Trek flick . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise , " Jonathan Frakes ( Riker ) tells The New York Daily News . " Patrick Stewart ( Picard ) does n't want to do one for about three years , and the studio wisely believes we should let the Star Wars films come and go before we get back on the ship . We want to stay out of their way . But you know we will be back . " <p> If this is true , it would mean we 'd have to wait until the year 2003 to actually see Star Trek 10 , unless Paramount decides to bring out the movie between two of the Star Wars films . Thanks go out to earl at the TrekWeb Bulletin Board for pointing me to this . <p> ET Online Features Jeri RyanChristian ( 12:15 pm CST ) Yesterday evening , Entertainment Tonight had an item about the new TV Guide issue , which will include a photo shoot with Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) and Lucy Lawless ( from ' Xena ' ) . A report about this has been posted on the Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breastplate and leather for sophisticated elegance , LUCY LAWLESS mounts a pedestal and plays goddess for the cover of TV Guide . Plus , she 's sharing the coveted cover with " Star Trek : Voyager 's " JERI RYAN , who gets to ditch her character 's half-Borg , half-human facade to play glamour girl . These two TV superwomen bonded quickly while sharing some tricks of their trade . On location at the photoshoot , we sat down with each of the sexy stars and captured some behind-the-scenes pictures . Take a look ! <p> The full article contains interviews with the two actresses , as well as pictures from the photo shoot and two short biographies . Also featured is a poll where you can ' vote on who 's the sexiest ' - currently Lucy Lawless is winning with 51% of the votes against Jeri Ryan 's 48% . <p> " Think Tank , " no doubt assisted by the appearance of Jason Alexander , cruised to Voyager 's best overnight mark since " Dark Frontier , " earning a 5.3 , 8 share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . That rating should assure the episode at least an average final rating . <p> The news in the timeslot competition was also quite good , seeing the show finish 4th in its timeslot , ahead of the WB 's " Charmed " ( 4.4/7 ) and Fox 's " Party of Five " ( 4.3/7 ) . Both of those shows were in repeats . With " Seven Days " ' above-average 3.8/6 performance and Voyager 's good mark , UPN was actually able to overtake the WB , a feat that UPN has only managed a few other times this year . <p> As I watched this week 's installment , I could n't help but feel a certain sense of deja vu , yet not in that LONG ... kind of way . Finally , I noticed that I kept expecting Keri Russell or Katie Holmes or whoever the It Girl of the moment is to show up . Suddenly , it dawned on me ... this week 's " Voyager " actually has many elements of both the classic and current teensploitation genre to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual fare . <p> Often been proposed , but never fully implimented , a database of everyone who comes to FedCom is now ready for you to fill in . All fields are optional except for one of the name fields ( obviously this is needed ) . <p> I 'm not sure where the actual database itself can be found , but you can now actually fill in the forms by going here . <p> Sev Trek : The Motionless Picture The imagination runs wild when one thinks of what Captain Quirk thought of Ilia ( you can suggest sevnames on the Ideas Board ) , the balding , sexually advanced supermodel . <p> As usual , punchlines can be submitted by going here , while the funniest entries will be listed here . The ' Pickhard 's fear of kids ' cartoon will probably be posted around Sunday , but I wonder - why has n't the Saavik cartoon from two weeks ago been posted yet ? <p> Gary Morton DiesChristian ( 9:48 am CST ) An article at CNN is reporting that Gary Morton recently died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband of Lucille Ball , and he was the manager of her production company Desilu for several years . In this capacity , he also oversaw the production of the Original Series , even though most of the work was done by Herb Solo , the ' executive in charge of production . ' Before that , however , he had a long and successful career as comedian , as you can read in this article at CNN . Thanks go out to Jason Ellis for pointing me to this . <p> Hosted by Sylvester McCoy , the long Easter weekend has a treat in store for fans of Star Trek as each day features two hours of their favourite episodes from Star Trek : Voyager and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . In between the specially selected episodes Trekkies compete for the ultimate accolade - to become ' Trek Master ' . <p> The first ' specially selected ' episode is DS9 's ' Doctor Bashir , I Presume , ' which airs at 16:00 GMT , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Distant Origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 9:37 am CST ) Yesterday we added five new sites to the TrekSeek database , bringing us to no less than 903 Star Trek links . Check out some of those new sites : <p> -The U.S.S. Kelly NCC-73400 is the flagship of the 7th Fleet , and also the largest Star Trek fan club in the state of Utah . They encourage invdividual development in the areas of : service , leadership , participation , team effort , and Star Trek knowledge . A lot of effort has gone into their web site - I certainly recommend visiting it . -Treknology has a database on Star Trek 's technology and physics . Also some real science and a web directory . -I often use the Universe as a source for TrekToday , so I was rather surprised to see that it was n't in our database yet . The site contains updated news on Voyager and Deep Space Nine , and the latest episode trailers . <p> All the other new sites that were added yesterday can be found at this page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , I managed to avoid posting any April Fool jokes , though that was only through sheer luck . Cinescape 's report of a Star Wars television series ( Jedi Academy ) sounded very believable to me , while I very nearly had a heart attack when ' John Ordover ' announced Pocket Books would stop publishing Trek books . Fortunately I realized the Pocket Books announcement was a misguided attempt at a joke before actually making an update about it , or I would have had to suffer through ten thousand mails ridiculing me this morning : - ) . <p> Update 20:17 CET : Sigh . Remember yesterday 's report in which I told you the German Star Trek Index was saying Sat.1 would start showing Voyager 's fifth season in May already ? Today they 're saying it was , ' of course , ' an April Fools Joke . I think I 'll go hit myself on the head now . <p> Thursday April 1 , 1999 <p> Games Zone Previews BotFChristian ( 1:52 pm CST ) The German Games Zone web site has published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Birth of the Federation . ' The preview takes a look at some of the features of the game , and also includes an interview with Kyle Brink , long-time member of the ' Birth of the Federation ' development team . <p> Even though the preview itself is in German , it also includes 7 new screenshots and several unique photographs taken at the Microprose buildings , so it should be worth checking out for non-Germans as well . In case you 're really desperate to read the article itself , there is a *very* rough ( and hilarious ) translation available via the Babelfish translator . Thanks go out to FedCom for pointing me to this . <p> Sat.1 Showing Fifth Season In MayChristian ( 12:30 pm CST ) The German Star Trek Index has a short newsflash up stating that the German television station Sat.1 will start showing Voyager 's fifth season in May already . As you may recall , a few weeks ago the station was considering cancelling the whole series , but after a huge wave of protests they decided to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become available tomorrow at the German Star Trek Index , which is when we 'll be reporting about it as well . <p> Trek Toy NewsChristian ( 12:27 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac has updated again , bringing us news on higher toy prices , toy sales figures , and a new column by Playmates ' Consumer Representative Mara Hart . The sales figures info is possibly the most important , as this will play a major role in determining the future of the Trek line . Fortunately , the news is good : <p> The currently available 4.5 " and 9 " figures are selling quite well , with the 9 " figures pretty close to sell-out already . Target 's order for the second wave of 4.5 " figures , Data and Seven of Nine , has already been confirmed and they are on track for their intended April release date . All other planned Target Exclusives are still on the schedule as originally reported . <p> Furtermore , a new edition of ' Mara 's Corner ' is online , in which a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I was just curious to know if Playmates is planning an Ezri Dax figure of any kind ? With DS9 leaving the air this year , I believe this would be a great figure ( 5 " or 9 " ) to add to our collections . <p> 14 more questions ( and their answers , of course ) can be found at the new edition of Mara 's Corner , while more Trek toy news can be found at the Raving Toy Maniac 's news page . <p> Jammer Reviews ' The Fight'Christian ( 12:08 pm CST ) Jamahl Epsicokhan just put up his review of Voyager 's ' The Fight . ' Just as most other reviewers , Jamahl was n't too excited about the episode : <p> All in all , this is mediocre Voyager . I was somewhat entertained by the visual ambition of " The Fight , " but the underlying story simply did not engage me . At the end , we 've faced and escaped another anomaly and logged another day at the office . Chakotay goes back into the holodeck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing interesting about it either . <p> More can be found in the full review , in which he awards the episode 2 out of 4 stars . <p> One of the Cinefex writers--who was kind enough to write me about some stuff last year--just wrote again to say that the April Cinefex should be in stores right now ( or , if not , it will be very soon ) .

With Deep Space Nine ending this season and Voyager losing credibility with fans , the Federation faces a problem more serious than the Borg or the Dominion : obsolescence . Despite rumors of another Trek series in development , there 's been no formal announcement , which leaves the Voyager as the only Trek presence for at least the next two years , and they 're still stuck in the Delta quadrant . Berman , executive producer for all things Star Trek , may need the positive buzz of a film to keep fans from defecting to Star Wars and other TV networks . <p> The rest of the article talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Enterprise-E . <p> Hang A Runabout In Your Christmas TreeChristian ( 10:20 am CST ) This year 's Hallmark Star Trek Christmas ornament vehicle will be one of DS9 's runabouts , namely the ' Rio Grande . ' The ornament will feature the voice of Michael Dorn ( Worf ) , and will presumably go on sale sometime before Christmas . Thanks go out to Mania 's Daily Buzz for reporting this . <p> What in heck is the point of having Jason Alexander play an alien who 's not even remotely funny ? I 'm sorry if that 's a shallow question , but I figured that if we were going to get a big-name guest star , the least Voyager 's own think tank could do is give us a big story to go with him . This was n't a dreadful episode - at least Kuros wanted Seven for her brains rather than her Borg assets like the folk in " Retrospect , " her guts like the Hirogen in " Hunters , " or her most obvious assets like the creep in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Seven-in-jeopardy stories before starting to wonder why in hell Janeway does n't just jettison her pet Borg for the safety of the rest of the crew ? <p> In the full review , Michelle Erica Green provides a detailed synopsis of the episode , and goes on to give a more in-depth analysis . Find it all here . <p> Every once in a while , a game design comes along and your initial impression is , " What are they thinking ? " Such was the case when we first heard about Interplay 's upcoming Star Trek : New Worlds , a real-time Star Trek strategy game in the general Command &amp; Conquer mold . What 's this ? Set on the ground ? ! The only time the Star Trek goes to ground is when the crew beams down to investigate something ; that makes it territory for an adventure game like ( ahem ) Vulcan Fury , not a strategy game right ? <p> Well , the folks at Interplay , their new strategy game division 14 East , and developer Binary Asylum certainly do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've actually got underway , they may have something here . They key issues , of course , are how to differentiate themselves from all the other Command &amp; Conquer-style ( versus Myth-style ) real-time strategy ( RTS ) games in terms of game design and how to bring Star Trek down to , err , " planets " in a way that fans will accept . Two tough crowds , RTS gamers and Trekers ; let 's look at Interplay 's plans for assuaging both . <p> Not only does the full preview give you a look at Interplay 's plans , it also gives you some beautiful screenshots you simply *have* to see . Check the preview out here . Thanks go out to Star Trek Gaming Central for pointing me to this . <p> Apologies for the lack of " Insurrection " data , but there 's a very good reason for it : there is virtually no " Insurrection " data . The movie just completed what is almost certain to be its last week in American theaters with an insignifigant 26,000 . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ som adjustment of the total gross in the numbers , that money will not be figured into the total gross . <p> It is very safe to assume that the number listed at the bottom of the Domestic chart is " Insurrection " ' s final domestic gross , plus or minus a few thousand . So , when it 's reported from now on , the final gross for " Insurrection " will be $70.1 million . That 's the second-lowest grossing Trek film , defeating only " The Final Frontier . " <p> The cumulative worldwide gross is now about $107 million , a figure which will also probably stay the same . Detailed analyses can be found at the Box Office Report . <p> In the end , " The Fight " packed very , very little punch ( Ha ha ! Sorry ) . The episode crashed to an awful 2.9 rating , 5 share . That abysmal performance places it even below " Vis a Vis " as the lowest-rated Voyager episode ever to air . Thankfully , the episode at least outpaced the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Fight " also finished 6th in its timeslot ( no surprise there ) behind a rerun of " Charmed , " which earned a 3.0 to land the #5 spot . Everything else was far , far away . <p> Even with these horrendous ratings , Voyager was still the top-rated UPN show last week , according to this report from Nielsen Media Research . ' Voyager ' tied at No. 96 with a rerun of the WB 's ' The Jamie Foxx Show ' and the WB 's ' Rescue 77 .

Christian ( 4:19 pm CST ) Over the past few years , we 've all heard about Star Trek 's declining Nielsen Ratings , and that this decline is not good . However , what precisely are these Nielsen ratings ? A new featured article at the Trek Nation attempts to explain exactly this : <p> Over time , the Nielsen system of determining who 's watching what on TV has become one of the most important aspects of the television business . Nielsens play a part in determining what companies advertise on certain shows , what shows should air in each timeslot , what shows are going to be kept on the air for a long time , and what shows are about to die . <p> It was Star Trek 's low Nielsen ratings that led NBC to nearly cancel the series after one season and eventually cut the show 's run at three years . By the same token , it was TNG 's outstanding Nielsens that persuaded Paramount to give DS9 and Voyager the green light . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that is easy to understand .

Fortunately , now we finally get to hear who he actually is : <p> Erik , could you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you came to be involved with Starfleet Command ? <p> I am an aerospace engineer by training but after only a couple of years at JPL , I found a way into game development . A few years and companies go by and I am working at Interplay . I was asked to take the lead on SFC last May and now here we are . <p> The full interview can be found here . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sarek , were married on the second day of the month of Sharveen at sacred wedding grounds belonging to the family of the groom . T'Pau of Vulcan , former leader of the planet , presided over the ceremony . The bride , Commander Saavik , is a starfleet officer in good standing , late of the original Starship Enterprise but most recently assigned as first officer aboard the U.S.S. Armstrong . The groom , Ambassador Spock , is also formerly of the first Starship Enterprise but is currently an Amabassador-at-Large , representing Federation interests throughout the galaxy . The couple met while the bride was a student at Starfleet Academy and the groom was assigned there as an instructor . Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan , father of the groom , was in attendance . Amanda , the mother of the groom , is deceased , as are the parents of the bride . The bride wore embroidered silver robes that have been in the groom 's family for over a thousand years . Among the guests were Dr. Leonard McCoy , an admiral in Starfleet , Lieutenant Jean-Luc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.S. Armstrong , and many members of the Armstrong crew . <p> A more detailed report on the wedding , the press release says , can be found in the Pocket Books novel Star Trek : Vulcan 's Heart by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz , on sale now . <p> More Foreign ' Insurrection'Christian ( 3:29 pm CST ) Gustavo Leao just mailed me about two official ' Insurrection ' sites which have been opened abroad - an Italian site by distributor UIP , and a Swedish site , also by UIP . Futhermore , the Swiss Daily Trekkies is reporting that the movie will be released on video in Switzerland in ' early July . ' <p> DS9 Finale Soundtrack Confirmed ? Christian ( 3:28 pm CST ) It looks like the recent mini-campaign to convince GNP Crescendo to release the ' What You Leave Behind ' soundtrack has been successful ! Patrick D. Clarke and John Watker just let me know that Crescendo is now saying " We are currently working on a release hopefully in a few months " in response to mails about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently assassinated Klingon chancellor Gowron for over seven years on ST:TNG and ST:DS9 , is the guest of honor for Empire Union charity event in the Detroit metro area June 25-27 . <p> Robert asked us to let you know that the event , at the Clarion Hotel near the Detroit airport in Troy , Mich. , is a benefit for the Motion Picture and Television Fund . As an extra guest , William Campbell ( " Koloth , " ST:DS9 ) will also be on hand . <p> There will be two versions of the demo . There 's the 49MB demo , which will have all the sound effects , including speech . Then there 's the 21.4MB demo . Same stuff , no sound . <p> According to the story , the demo will be made available at 6:15pm , no time zone specified . Thanks go out to Blue 's News for the link . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later by Voyager 's ' Tuvix . ' <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) The Trek BBS now also has a new design , which is based on this TrekToday design . At the moment there is still a slight bug which causes the menu to fall off the screen is 640*480 screen resolutions , but that should be resolved soon . Take a look at some of the current active discussions : <p> -The visitors of the Trek BBS are currently writing up their own original Voyager script - why not participate ? <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:26 pm CST ) So , what do you all think ? Welcome to the new-style TrekToday ! Together with the new design , there have also been several major changes - the most important of which being that I 'm no longer part of the TrekZone Network . Sadly , Saleel Majeed and I had several major differences of opinion , so in the end we each went our separate ways . Unfortunately , this also means I 've had to leave behind TrekSeek , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm especially sorry to have to leave TrekSeek , as that is actually what I first spent time on when I started working with Saleel . Of course , I will be forever grateful for him for welcoming me into the online Trek world , but now it is time for us to move on . <p> Instead of the TrekZone Network , however , TrekToday is now part of the Trek Nation , which will open in a few days . It was originally scheduled to open today , but unfortunately the move caused a few complications which I first had to deal with . Also still with us are the Trek BBS , and , at new locations , Star Trek : Hypertext and Warp Eleven . <p> More news about all of this should hopefully be coming over the next couple of days : - ) . Meanwhile , if you have any comments about the new design , do let me know . <p> John Cook at Sev Trek just put up a new ' Write Your Own Sev Trek Competition : ' <p> Bald captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier strips but have never tackled head on ( pardon the pun ) until now . The idea was actually developed during a comic workshop I ran at the FSF Presents Nog Convention . <p> The independent film Trekkies finally came down here to New Orleans , and I finally saw it at Movie Pitchers , this place where you can buy beer and flop into an armchair in front of the screen . There were four other people in the theatre with me , and I assumed they were fellow Star Trek fans ... that is , before I saw the film . <p> After the film , I knew we could n't be Star Trek fans , because we did n't belong in a mental institution . <p> Okay , okay . I guess that 's a little unfair . But still , as much as I did enjoy parts of the film , the message of Trekkies is really nothing more than , " Ooooh . Look at the weirdos ! " There are no real insights into the fandom , no theories about the appeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just nerds on parade . <p> In the rest of the review she analyzes some of the film 's worst scenes , as you can read here . <p> On June 30th , Sid leaves for New Zealand to begin work on a feature film called " The Vertical Limit . " This film also stars Chris O'Donnell and features mountain climbing and the rescue of some climbers that get into trouble . Sid 's character heads the team of rescuers . The job involves one month of intensive training in mountain climbing that precedes the actual filming . <p> The site is also reporting that Siddig 's voice can be found on the audio collection ' More of the Best of Science Fiction and Fantasy , ' where he reads two stories . Thanks go out to Cathy Thomson for reporting this ! <p> Ron Moore To Leave Voyager ? Christian ( 3:29 pm CST ) TrekWeb is reporting some extremely bad Voyager news - apparently Ronald D. Moore will be leaving ' Star Trek : Voyager ' again . Moore served as co-executive producer on Deep Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager . Take a look at the apparent reasons for his move : <p> The startling news comes as a surprise to many who were expecting Ron to lend , among other talents , his extraordinary character writing ability to Voyager . Although reasons for the move are not known , many speculate that it may have involved unreconcilable differences with the show 's executive producer , Brannon Braga . The two won a Hugo Award for their collaborative work on The Next Generation 's finale , " All Good Things ... , " and co-wrote the films Star Trek : Generations and Star Trek : First Contact . It is unknown at this time what Ron 's reasons for leaving are . <p> This certainly is very bad news for Voyager - many viewed Ron Moore as the person who could finally turn around Voyager and give it some high-quality stories . About a week ago it was rumoured that one of Moore 's scripts was torn apart by the writing staff - I certainly hope that was n't the reason for his leaving ? You can find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be releasing an official press release in a few days . <p> Also , if you have anything to say about this surprising turn of events , a special thread has been created about it at the Trek BBS . Let the world know what you think here ! <p> Armin Shimerman Play CancelledChristian ( 3:28 pm CST ) The Continuum has a very short report up stating that " the Los Angeles production of the play " Servant of Two Masters " has been cancelled . " Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) would have starred in the play , together with , if I recall correctly , his wife . Info about ticket refunding can be found here . <p> In conclusion , Birth of the Federation does n't come anywhere near breaking the curse over all Star Trek games to date . This game is nearly impossible to play , until they get a patch out for it . The only way I would recommend this game is if you are a die-hard Trek fan . This game has a lot of promise , and it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slow and buggy . Maybe a patch will fix it , but a company should n't have to patch a game simply to make it playable . I find it impossible that Microprose 's QA department did not find these problems . Chalk BoF up to another game rushed out the door incomplete , with the programmers already working on a patch . Shame on you , Microprose . You could have done so much better . <p> The day has finally come ; DS9 has seen its end . And while things looked bleak last week , this ending is a bright one . " What You Leave Behind " capped Trek 's third series with a 5.4 rating , ranking 7th . That 's DS9 's best rating since the first week of March last year when " Change of Heart " earned a 5.5 . " What You Leave Behind " rated higher than both " Tears of the Prophets " and " Call to Arms , " making itself the top season finale since 1996 . The show was the highest rated episode of season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season low , " The Dogs of War " ( 3.7 ) . <p> Despite DS9 's slip on the competitive front in these last two seasons , DS9 ended its final year right where it began -- on top . DS9 was the highest-rated first-run syndicated drama in the ' 98-99 television season and " What You Leave Behind " outpaced every other syndicated drama on television , including the off-network reruns of " The X-Files , " which finished the week with a 4.6 . " What You Leave Behind " ' s 7th place overall rank among syndicated shows is DS9 's highest rank since " Trials and Tribble-ations , " in November of 1996 . <p> Foreign Insurrection NewsChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) I just received two reports about Insurrection happenings abroad . First of all , Christopher Yow mailed me to let me know that ' Insurrection ' will be released on video on the 23rd of July in Australia . Secondly , Sandro just let me know that ' Insurrection ' premiered in Italian cinemas last week , and it 's now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelley MemorialChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) The Continuum has now also put up a report of the private DeForest Kelley memorial which was held at Paramount on Tuesday . The event was hosted by producer A.C. Lyles , a long-time friend of Kelley : <p> Lyles , a friend of Mr. Kelley since 1940 , spoke of his accomplishments and early life , including his boyhood in Georgia , his move as a young man to California , his World War II military service , and his early screen tests for Paramount . A highlight of the memorial was a video tribute , edited by ST:VOY Supervising Producer Peter Lauritson , following Mr. Kelley 's career through his first screen appearance in " Fear in the Night " through Westerns with the likes of Henry Fonda and Richard Widmark --- and eventually his most special moments as " Bones " McCoy in TV and film . <p> Many of Mr. Kelley 's long time co-stars were in attendance , as well as members of the Star Trek family from other series and projects who knew him by reputation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow Carolyn , who is recuperating from a leg injury and was unable to attend . <p> Ira Steven Behr ( Executive Producer on ST:DS9 ) will be joining us to talk about all 7 seasons of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ! Here 's your chance to ask a question of one of the " movers and shakers " in the Star Trek universe . Ira Steven Behr was involved with ST:DS9 for its entire seven-year run . He helped define many of your favorite characters , species , relationships and storylines . Now you can ask him where the idea for " Vic Fontaine " came from , why he chose to cast rock star Iggy Pop as a Vorta , how he came to write the book The Rules of Acquisition , or why three different actresses played " Ziyal . " <p> Mr. Behr wrote three episodes of ST:TNG including fan-favorite " Yesterday 's Enterprise " along with an amazing 54 episodes of ST:DS9 . Look them up with your PADD , and ask him about your favorites ! <p> New Trek RPG ProductsChristian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box column at Mania , Star Trek RPG creator Kenneth Hite mentions two new Star Trek role-playing game books which just came out .

There 's maps of the key Federation members -- Alpha Centauri IV , Andoria , Betazed , Bolarus IX , Earth , Tellar , and Vulcan , and system maps of most of the other worlds in the list . Each planet gets the full treatment : planetary ( and sometimes system ) templates , ecology ( including several creature writeups ) , story hooks , geography , strategic value , and so forth . There 's even a writeup on the Ba'ku planet from Star Trek : Insurrection , should you want such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be over , but the story continues with Simon and Schuster 's action-adventure game Star Trek Deep Space Nine : The Fallen . Players take on the roles of Sisko , Worf , or Kira in a race to find the three orbs of power needed to stop the return of the Pah Wraiths . Of course , there are other forces in the Alpha Quadrant who seek the same thing and will try to stop you . Each character has his or her own story line and objectives , and players can expect to run into such familiar races as the Cardassians , Klingons , and Jem'Hadar--plus a new race unique to this game , the Grigari . The game will take place in over 30 environments , including the DS9 station itself and the USS Defiant . Multiplay options are also available . <p> You can find the full preview here .

I just spent over two hours at the City Hall here in Leiden getting a new passport . Fortunately , I can now confidently report that : a ) The ceiling of our passport office consists of 158 separate panels . b ) That 's about half of the amount of people waiting in line with me. c ) The coffee is undrinkable . <p> Out of necessity , today 's update will be somewhat smaller than usual - fortunately tomorrow 's update will more than make up for that , as you 'll be able to see the new design for the first time !

He received the following reply from GNP 's Mark Banning : <p> We have received several letters and e-mails concerning the final episode score . It is under strong consideration for a fall release . If you know anyone else who want to see this album come out , please encourage them to write us . <p> Please send mail to GNP Crescendo to ask them about the ' What You Leave Behind ' soundtrack ! And , while you 're at it , you might perhaps also want to ask about the ' Scorpion ' soundtrack , which certainly most of us would like to see as well .

Since about February , UPN has been cutting two minutes from each Voyager episode in order to show extra commercials , which resulted in two versions of each episode existing . Now each episode produced at Paramount will just last 42 minutes . <p> Margaret Clark 's Back ! Christian ( 3:21 pm CST ) It 's almost a miracle !

Voyager got a 1.8 and was nr. 107 . Voyager was 6th for the hour behind " Charmed " that got 2.7 . It was Voyager lowest rerun ever , falling behind last years 1.9 . But it was n't the lowest episode ever , because this years first run episode " Juggernaut " got a 1.7 . <p> ... <p> UPn 's highest rated show wasent Voyager , but " Moesha " with a 2.1 ! <p> Somehow I 've got the feeling the ratings might well sink even further over the coming months .

Christian ( 3:17 pm CST ) Sorry for the late start today - unfortunately my ISP seems on the verge of breaking down , and I had no web access at all for about two hears earlier this evening .

When this magazine 's editors learned that I had kept a diary of the Herculean efforts to make " Trekkies , " a film about the legions of obsessive " Star Trek " fans , they asked if they could publish it . What follows is an edited and updated version . <p> Wednesday , May 19 , 1999 , North America At midnight , George Lucas opened his " Star Wars " prequel , " Episode I : The Phantom Menace .

Thanks go out to Captain.net for the link . <p> Where are you in the process of making another Next Generation feature film ? All I can say is that we do not have a film planned for the fall of 2000 , which would be a two-year hiatus like the last two were . As to whether there will be a film the year after that and what it will be about and who it will feature is all in discussion right now . The next film has not been planned significantly enough to say that it will definately not be a Next Generation movie . I ca n't imagine that it will take more than a couple of years to get another film in production . I do n't think the fans have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get another Star Trek series in the couple of years . We are in development on it now .

My instincts tell me that the new series will come before the next film . <p> Excerpt from response to , " How is this time a turning point for Star Trek ? " I think that the next steps we take , which are steps that I am involved with now , are very important . We have to give our audience something new and fresh but , at the same time , give them something that is Star Trek . <p> A research team at Ris National Laboratory in Roskilde , Denmark , has invented a new instant system for taking holographic snapshots that could result in the first 3-D movies not requiring special glasses , Business Week reports in its current issue .

While the English-speaking response was predictably strong , I was amazed at the number of non-English responses that I received , especially from Germany and Brazil . <p> The places were occasionally difficult to deal with , as many used non-English characters that my tools did n't always recognize . For the German-ish cities , ich machte was ich konnte , and it helped that I 've actually been to many of the represented cities ( although no two of you spelled " Luebbeck " the same way , strangely ) . For the others , well , it 's kind of hard to get " Sao Paulo " wrong , and I gave it my best guess the rest of the time . With the sheer volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence .

Christian ( 2:29 pm CST ) At the Sci-Fi Channel 's Sci Fi Wire , they 've launched an online poll which asks " Which was the better space station SF show - DS9 or Babylon 5 ? " Unfortunately , after 338 votes have been cast , only 37% of all people voted for DS9 - please head over to the Sci-Fi Wire and give our favourite series some extra votes ! <p> Worst-Ever BotF ReviewChristian ( 2:29 pm CST ) Ugh . Kevin Jenkins at MPOG.COM has written a review of ' Birth of the Federation , ' the game which , according to Jenkins , ' boldly sucks like no game has sucked before . ' The review is filled with criticisms of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federation is even worse than M.A.X. 2 and that 's saying something . Even hours later , I still feel a vague sense of irritation and a slight urge to vomit resulting from torturing myself long enough to give a fair review . Sadomasochists should go right out and buy Birth of the Federation . Everyone else should avoid computer game stores for the next week lest they gaze upon this basilisk . After that , just give the bargain bins a wide berth . <p> Booklist " Vulcan 's Heart " ReviewChristian ( 2:29 pm CST ) The new edition of Booklist , the official review magazine of the American Library Association , contains a review of the new " Vulcan 's Heart " novel . Reviewer Roland Green is rather positive about the new Josepha Sherman / Susan Shwartz book : <p> Opening some years after Sherman and Shwartz 's superb Vulcan 's Forge ( 1997 ) concluded , this sequel is even better . Sherman and Shwartz develop familiar Star Trek characters and background in realistic detail while remaining faithful to the underlying concepts and values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract non-Trekkers in appreciable numbers and , of course , Trekkers in swarms and hordes . <p> Major thanks go out to John Ordover for sending this in ! <p> Decipher HappeningsChristian ( 2:29 pm CST ) Lots of new stuff is available at the site of Decipher , the official Star Trek Customizable Card Game publisher . First of all , ' Major Rakal ' has written an extensive article on how to use the official Star Trek CCG message board , using a special board system . Besides that , Decipher has a list of the winners of the recent Return to Farpoint tournaments , an updated version of the current rulings and updated Where to Buy pages for the Trek CCG game . <p> GamePen BotF ReviewChristian ( 2:28 pm CST ) At GamePen , a rather extensive new ' Birth of the Federation ' review is available , looking at MicroProse 's new turn-based strategy game . Reviewer Andrew S. Bub is n't that enthusiastic about the game , awarding it just 2 out of 5 stars : <p> Star Trek meets Civilization ( Civ ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Microprose 's ambitious ST:TNG Birth of the Federation . The sad truth is that Star Trek games almost universally stink . This is hard to bear for any Trek fan like me , or the thousands of others waiting to get their paws on this game . Since Microprose knows this style of game , having had much success with its Civ series and its MOO series , the logical conclusion seemed to indicate great things for this game . However , it seems the developers were either drunk on too much Romulan ale , or out of their Vulcan minds <p> Voyager News and Reviews Weekly brings together some of the ' net 's best-known and most respected Trek reviewers for the 1999 VNRW Critic 's Choice Awards , which celebrate the best elements of Star Trek : Voyager 's fifth season . Categories include Best Actor , Best Actress , and Best Episode of Season 5 . <p> The reviewers include people such as Steve Perry , Michelle Erica Green and David E. Sluss , so the awards should certainly turn out to be interesting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little confusion over which days a weeks ' figures apply to , I can bring you the 30 May - 06 June figures . On BBC2 , it was a pretty good week . TNG ranked a respectable #12 , with 2.68m viewers for its double bill - a substantial improvement over the previous week . <p> DS9 jumped back into the charts for the first time in weeks ( just when the season ended , though ... ) , with the double bill rounding up Season 1 reruns - #24 , 1.8m viewers . Not brilliant but a definite improvement . Voyager 's continuation of the Hirogen story arc , " Prey " , dropped from last week in viewers but increased in rank - it was up from #20 to #15 , but down by 0.23m viewers . <p> Meanwhile , on Sky , Voyager was continuing to show its popularity - it ranked #4 with the 100th episode , " Timeless " . We can expect a steady increase in viewers on Sky for Voyager as more people take advantage of the current offers for ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what exactly is Starfleet Command ? Well it 's a realtime tactical combat simulator using ships from the Star Trek Universe . This differs from realtime strategy games in that you have a set number of ships and resources in a particular mission . There is no gathering resources or building units . This is actually a strength to the game . Since you control so few ships ( 1-3 , in multiplayer , 1-6 in single player ) each ship is vital . You really feel like you are a captain of a ship . Each decision you make is important . <p> The full preview starts with a 3-page original story , based on actual events in the game , which certainly is an original way to start a preview !

Wedlan at the LA Times has written an interview with LeVar Burton , who 's described as being extremely busy with lots of projects at the same time . Take a look at a short quote from the interview : <p> Question : Why do you think you 're so industrious ? <p> Answer : I guess I 'm one of those people who suffers from the delusion that unless I keep doing things , I 'll cease to have value in the world--you know what I mean . I believe very strongly that everybody is here for a very specific purpose and that one of the keys to living here successfully , in this realm , is to discern what your purpose is , align yourself to that and pursue it with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full article . Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for pointing me to this . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 2:15 pm CST ) This morning , I spent some time implementing a few new hacks at the Trek BBS , with the help of TDawg , the great webmaster of the Trek Gaming Alliance . Thanks to these hacks , you 'll now be able to see how many times each thread has been read , and the ranking system has been updated as well . Take a look at some of the threads currently taking place on the new , improved Trek BBS : <p> It seems that DeForest Kelley was unable to participate in the Secret of Vulcan Fury project due to health concerns . Instead , they were using a voice actor to play the part of Bones in the game . Apparently , he did a good impression of the doctor . So , all of our propaganda about " doing it for Bones " is kind of pointless . This is not anybody 's fault , so do n't get pissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be used in a mind-meld sequence in the latter part of the game ( as an " older " Dr. McCoy ) , but it just did n't happen . If the game had continued on schedule , we may have been able to see Mr. Kelley as Dr. McCoy , even if only some small way . Unfortunately , things did not progress on schedule . <p> If this is the case , I do find it rather strange that the IMDB listing of the game includes DeForest Kelley as one of the game 's stars . Still , no matter if this is true or not , the campaign is still open , as of course this game still deserves to be saved ! <p> LeVar Burton , who hopes to return to series television with the show he 's developed for Paramount , says the flack the networks are getting because of their white-bread programming can only help his chances . <p> As I look at the landscape of TV for the fall season , it seems absolutely and totally devoid of color , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith ' ' drama to the networks as a midseason replacement that he would headline and exec-produce . <p> He describes John Smith ' ' as being about an amnesiac searching the country trying to find clues to his identity . ' ' He notes that he would also helm at least a segment a month . <p> The full article also contains a short mention of ' Smart House , ' a comedy directed by Burton which will premiere next week on the Disney Channel . <p> Join The Starfleet Command BetaChristian ( 1:34 pm CST ) The people at Interplay seem to want to make ' Starfleet Command ' the game with the most widely open beta test in the history of video gaming - IGN PC has just announced a special contest in which you 'll be able to win a place in the beta testing team : <p> Okay , we thought we 'd give you a heads up for a kick-ass contest that 'll be going up next week .

What do you have to so ? Just drop back in at about 6:00pm on this coming Monday ( I said about , if it 's not up by 6:00 we do n't want any letters ) and look for the contest story . How easy is that ? <p> New ' Trekminds ' AvailableChristian ( 1:33 pm CST ) The people at the German Radio Trek have put up a new edition of TREKMinds , their bi-weekly online radio show . This time , the show has features dealing with the passing of DeForest Kelley , the end of Deep Space Nine , Gene Roddenberry 's ' Earth : Final Conflict , ' and several other Trek discussion topics . You can listen to the new edition by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand German . <p> Jeri Ryan On DilbertChristian ( 1:33 pm CST ) The Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage is reporting that next season , UPN 's ' Dilbert ' will feature Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) as Dilbert 's Seven of Nine alarm clock ! The airdate of the episode is currently not yet known , though it 'll of course be somewhere early in the season . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for this . <p> GA-Source:Could you tell me something about your in-game scripting system ICARUS ? How will the ICARUS system meet or exceed the amount of interactivity that games in the past have displayed ? <p> Josh Weier:As we went into the project , our design goals called for a living , breathing environment . One of our main goals being to make the player feel like he or she was part of the crew of the starship Voyager . That meant interacting with the other members of the ship , as well as having those other members interacting with each other and their surroundings . They needed to walk around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . Trying to achieve these sort of goals with a normal AI setup would have been next to impossible . Instead , we decided to focus our efforts on a scripting system that would not only allow control to this degree , but was also intuitive to work with . Thus , ICARUS ( Interpreted Command An ReUsable Script ) was born . The main focus of ICARUS was to meet these needs in a simple , but flexible manner . The system was named ICARUS as a reminder of this focus . <p> The full interview , written by John Bergerud , examines the ICARUS system in some more detail , and also has info on the other enhancements made to the game engine . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for pointing me to this . <p> Future Gamer BotF ReviewChristian ( 1:32 pm CST ) Ben Morris at the British online gaming zine Future Gamer has written a small review of ' Birth of the Federation , ' Microprose 's new turn-based strategy game . Morris is rather positive about BotF : <p> Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has great depth . The random nature of the map allows for infinitely different games , the opponents are suitably challenging and all the action is fronted by stylish presentation . ST : BotF is a welcome addition to the strategy halls of fame . <p> In the end Morris awards the game 84% , as you can read in the full mini-review . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 1:31 pm CST ) -Unfortunately the UK television info will be suspended for the next few days , at least until the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective updates again . <p> Hello World !

If so , please send me a mail , as I 'm currently testing out the new TrekToday design , and I 'm really wondering how it 'll look in such browsers . <p> Saturday June 19 , 1999 <p> ' Rules of Netquisition ' ResultsChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) Psi Phi has the results available of the fifth annual Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could submit their own Rules of Acquisition . Take a look at the Grand Place Winner : <p> TOS DVDs SoonChristian ( 3:13 pm CST ) Paula Nash just informed me that , according to DVD Express , the first two TOS DVDs will ship on the 17th of August . Volume 1 and 2 of the Original Series DVDs will store ' Where No Man Has Gone Before / The Corbomite Maneuver ' and ' Mudd 's Women / The Enemy Within , ' and come with a suggested retail price of $19.95 . Thanks go out to Paula Nash for reporting this ! <p> DeForest Kelley ClipsChristian ( 3:08 pm CST ) For once , the people at the Sci-Fi Channel have done something decent -in memory of DeForest Kelley , they 've put up three video clips of him talking about technology , Gene Roddenberry , and Leonard McCoy . Presumably these come from the third series of Sci-Fi Channel TOS showings , which would originally have featured introductions by DeForest Kelley . You can find the three QuickTime clips by going here . <p> Alice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike Walter she is as equally vibrant in real life as she is in her fantasy world . Alice could easily slip in to a world of her own making if it was n't for her anchor to reality , her best friend , Dot . <p> This week she 's apparently slipped away to Voyager , as you can read in the ' Alice ' installments of Wednesday , Thursday , Friday and today . They 're really rather good , and I recommend you check them out ! <p> Brent Spiner At South Park PremiereChristian ( 2:54 pm CST ) According to a press release from Paramount , Brent Spiner ( Data ) will be attending the world premiere of ' South Park : Bigger , Longer &amp; Uncut , ' to which he lent his voice . The premiere will take place at the Mann Chinese Theater on Wednesday the 23rd of June , and will also be attended by all the South Park members . You can find the full press release here . Thanks go out to Welcome , Brent Spiner Fans ! for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time to provide us with some details on the second episode of the season , apparently written by Ron Moore : <p> The show begins with at a huge space station which hosts a bunch of aliens . Soon Voyager discovers three ex-Borg who are trying to separate from each other but ca n't , their only hope for sanity is to be re-joined to the collective . Eight years prior these three Borg and 7 of 9 were separated from the collective , and she 's the one who forced them all to rejoin the Borg when they were thinking of leaving . Interesting Tidbits : Paris and Kim play a game with some aliens and misinterpret the rules and get in a bar fight ... Seven and Naomi bond more ... Chakotay and 7 have some good dialogue ... <p> Scarlett is back on the set of Voyager this week working as Naomi Wildman on what will be the second episode of the new season . It 's called Survival Instinct . That 's all I can say for now . Hope that answers everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hack ReportChristian ( 2:53 pm CST ) Vidiot has finally updated his Voyager Hack Job again , this time informing us which scenes were cut from Wednesday 's ' Latent Image .

Saturday is already a quiet day usually , and I suppose a Saturday during hiatus is even worse . Let 's hope there 'll be a little more news over the coming months . <p> Naturally , if you 're disappointed about the lack of new stuff to be found here , you can of course do something about it yourself . I 'm always open for convention reports , book , toy , or game reviews , or articles on whatever you want that 's related to Star Trek . Please feel free to contact me if you have any great article ideas : - ) . <p> Friday June 18 , 1999 <p> First " Vulcan 's Heart " ReviewChristian ( 3:20 pm CST ) Recently , Pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vulcan 's Heart " novel to the Pocket Books message boards . This review first appeared in ' Amazing Stories , ' and was written by John C. Bunnel , who rather liked the novel : <p> Star Trek fans should consider VULCAN 'S HEART a book not to be missed . But while the novel is perhaps a bit less accessible to non-Trek audiences than was VULCAN 'S FORGE , it is by any measure a skillfully told tale with enough sheer power to deserve the widest possible readership . <p> Comparisons are fun , as long as everyone 's polite , and so for a few months now I 've been planning to do a little comparative article on the latest Trek films and The Phantom Menace . <p> Those plans changed somewhat , however , after I actually saw Phantom Menace . Sorry , ... but I was severely unimpressed with the movie . I think it takes all the bad stuff from the first three films and amplifies it while abandoning the things that make Star Wars : A New Hope my favorite film of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here complaining about Phantom Menace , I 'm going to have some fun with a more general comparison . Does Star Trek still come out on top ? You bet ! But Star Wars still rocks . <p> TV Zone Trek FeaturesChristian ( 1:32 pm CST ) The latest issue of the British TV Zone magazine features an interview with Ethan Phillips , who stars on Voyager as Neelix : <p> Delta Quadrant denizen Neelix has been a guide , a cook and an ambassador for Capt . Janeway . Star Ethan Phillips talks about the one-lung wonder he loves to play : " Without a doubt Neelix has had some intense experiences " <p> The actual interview can unfortunately only be read by actually buying the magazine . The TV Zone web site does feature a new review of the ' Strange New Worlds II ' book , which reviewer Megan O'Neill was really impressed with : <p> It 's no surprise this is superior fan fiction . If they are n't all quite as good collectively as SNW I 's stories , well , I 'm not complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Nine , I 'm glad for any new Trek . That this collection includes some excellent bits is just icing . <p> Ten of the 17 stories deal with some element of Time travel , obviously a highly attractive plot device . The three best : both stories in which the wonderful pair of Kirk-hating ' temporal investigators , ' who first visited DS9 during Trials and Tribble-ations , appear , and the second prize winner , a TOS story titled Triptych , which plays with the possible time lines evolving from the Edith Keeler incident . It 's an outstanding piece , by the way , worth the purchase price of the book and clearly deserving of the Grand Prize , which goes instead to a touching little Seven of Nine story , A Ribbon for Rosie . <p> Tim Lynch ' Jeopardy ! ' AppearanceChristian ( 1:31 pm CST ) Psi Phi has put up a review of Tim Lynch 's appearance on the ' Jeopardy ! ' game show , last Wednesday . The review is written by Thomas Y. Galloway , and almost exactly follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Jeopardy ! 6/16/99 ' was the long awaited Tim Lynch episode . Something of a sequel to " Win Ben Stein 's Money with Tim Lynch " , it was a marked improvement as it showed that while Tim continues to have buzzer problems in the first act , if he can make it to the second act he 'll improve significantly . <p> However , the first act was noted by the sort of golden moment everyone hopes would happen to them if they get on Jeopardy ! . Namely , you get a Daily Double , make it a true Daily Double by risking it all ... and the answer is one that is so up your alley that you 'd have to have a stroke forcing you to uncontrollably remember every Ferengi focused episode of DS9 followed by Voyager 's " evolution " episode before you 'd miss it . Asking a former Caltech physics grad student who came up with E=MC2 is about as much as one could hope for barring getting asked who did various Star Trek reviews on Usenet from 1988-1999 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game show a 7 , as you can read in the full review . Another review of Tim Lynch 's appearance , written by Chuck Cohen , is now also available at Psi Phi - you can find that here .

Are you referring to " Equinox " ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Yes <p> Later on he also announced the novelization will be written by Diane Carey , who also novelized ' What We Leave Behind ' and several other Trek episodes . <p> James Cromwell Chat TranscriptChristian ( 1:30 pm CST ) On Wednesday , Entertainment Tonight Online hosted a live chat with James Cromwell ( Zefram Cochrane ) . In their incredibly wisdom , the ET people decided to split up the transcript over a dozen separate pages , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found on the last page of the transcript : <p> JimmyD says : How did you like becoming a part of the Star Trek universe ? <p> James : It was interesting . I had worked on the television show a couple times , so I knew everybody . So actually making the film was effortless and a lot of fun . I thought it was a good script and I enjoyed my character immensely . What was interesting was I had just begun to become interested in extra-terrestrials as a real possibility . I was associated with an organization called CSETI Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence , and I was beginning to develop a story idea for a novel that I 'm writing , which is about contact . I believe personally that contact has occurred . I believe that the federal government has not told us what the truth is . <p> The full transcript can be found here , while more from Cromwell about Star Trek can be found here . <p> New LeVar Burton SeriesChristian ( 1:30 pm CST ) TV Guide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a new television series for Paramount , enitled ' John Smith .

According to TV Guide , the series is " about an amnesiac searching the country to find clues to his identity , ' and Burton is hoping to launch it as a midseason replacement . <p> STAR TREK MAGAZINE reports that Ronald Moore , famous for writing some of STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION 's best episodes , will take over as executive producer on STAR TREK:VOYAGER . Moore co-wrote the first two TNG films with current VOYAGER producer Brannon Braga , and was co-executive producer on STAR TREK : DEEP SPACE NINE ( which ended last week ) . His first work on the show will be seen this fall when VOYAGER returns for its sixth season . <p> Does this mean Ron Moore will be at the same level as Brannon Braga next year ? <p> McIntyre Goes To HollywoodChristian ( 1:29 pm CST ) Eon Magazine is reporting that Jim Henson Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , ' Vonda N. McIntyre 's Nebula Award-winning fantasy novel . For Trek fans , she is probably most famous for being the writer of many of the early TOS movies , and for writing the first-ever TOS hardcover , ' Enterprise . ' <p> Sadly , things begin to go downhill the further one progresses into the game . While BotF makes several overtures at greatness , it contains a number of thematic and technical flaws that damage its appeal . The most immediately noticeable is that , after an auspiciously pleasing opening , the gameplay begins to narrow itself until combat becomes the central factor . This would not be such a big deal in and of itself if it were n't for the fact that players to whom this development is not immediately apparent could be spending a large portion of their time focusing on other aspects , all the while falling irrecoverably behind the curve . Not to mention the fact that Star Trek fans have always prided themselves on the notion that their sci-fi universe of choice is not devoted to warfare , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pale in comparison to the technical bugs that , when they do appear , have the potential to totally ruin any enjoyment there is to be had . Both of these problems are the worst variety of bugaboo , because they only reveal themselves after extended play and add a large degree of frustration to what would otherwise be a stand-up product . <p> In the full review , he still ends up awarding the game 3 stars , as you can read here . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the link . <p> Insurrection Drops To No.9Christian ( 1:28 pm CST ) On the Billboard video rental top 10 , ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' has dropped to the ninth place , which presumably means this will be its last week on the Billboard charts . The video has already dropped out of the top 10 from the Video Software Dealers Association , which is the one I 've mostly been reporting about over the past few weeks . <p> Happy Birthday Mr. PresidentChristian ( 1:28 pm CST ) Today is the 76th birthday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Voyage Home ' as the Federation president . Besides that , he 's also appeared on The Next Generation as Steven Miller in the episode ' Haven .

The official Sky web site has n't been updated in weeks , and neither has the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . Still , according to the Collective 's unconfirmed list , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Improbable Cause ' tomorrow at 16:00 BST , and Voyager 's ' Innocence ' at 17:00 BST . <p> -German Sat.1 is also causing me trouble , as their site currently appears to be down . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 1:27 pm CST ) Below you 'll find some of the current most active discussions at the Trek BBS , the fastest-growing online Trek community : <p> -In ' The Phantom Menace , ' Yodo says that Anakin is too old to be trained as a Jedi .

First of all , a lead designer Chris Foster just sent along some info about which parts of Voyager you 'll be able to explore in the game : <p> While exploring Voyager , you as Munro will basically be able to explore areas of a deck at a time - ones that are relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . We have many of the main areas of Voyager built , and they include : the bridge , engineering , the mess hall , astrometrics , sickbay , transporter rooms , the cargo bays and the shuttlebay . Most of these will be separate ' levels ' to keep the loading times down . <p> Our current plan is to use the turbolifts as a story element which take you to the specific deck you need to go to ( level ) to continue gameplay . Level loads would most likely take place in them . <p> Major thanks go out to Chris Foster for answering my questions about the game ! Furthermore , Raven programmer Mike Gummelt gave some extra info about the game 's characters in his . plan file : <p> In remembrance of Deforest Kelley . This week 's comic strip is a tribute to the late Dr McCoy . It requires two punchlines - Quirk 's speech bubble , and the last word of McCorduroy 's famous " I 'm a doctor " line . <p> Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television series , Star Trek : Voyager . The title , being developed by Raven Software , will also be the first game to be released after Quake III : Arena itself that will make use of i 'd Software 's latest 3D Quake engine . <p> ' Latent Image ' Overnight RatingsChristian ( 5:18 pm CST ) The Star Trek Universe has put up the overnight ratings of yesterday 's rerun of ' Latent Image . ' Voyager was down 0.6 from last week , receiving a 3.2/5 , which of course did n't give it more than a 6th position . Besides that , the Universe has some alarming news on UPN 's current reach : <p> UPN has lost more affiliates last season ( even though it got some new ones ) and it ca n't be seen in 73% of the US anymore ! The percentage is weigh below that , I would estimate about 65 % . UPN still covers most of the overnight metered markets , so Voyager does ok , but it lost many affiliates and that hurts the national ratings a lot ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball ( yeah , it 's baseball season ) so Voyager did n't run in it 's usual timeslot or did n't air at all ! You can blame UPN for all that . It 's not like Voyager loses more and more viewers because they do n't like the show ! They just are n't able to see it anymore ! Expect future ratings to be lower than last season ( business as usual ) . <p> I 'm not sure what to say in this report -- when I found the ratings for " The Dogs of War , " I thought there might have been a misprint , but alas , these seem to be correct . Unbelievably , " Dogs " fell to a series-low 3.7 rating , ranking 14th . That 's a huge crash from the great ratings of the last two months , falling 16% from last week 's " Extreme Measures " and 10% from last week 's most comparable show , " The Sound of Her Voice , " which was tied for DS9 's former all-time low mark of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddening showing , the outlook for DS9 's finale has gone from wonderful to pretty bad . Even if the show spikes a full point from this awful episode , it would still fall below even this season 's highest mark . I hope I 'm wrong and " What You Leave Behind " performs wonderfully , but I guess we 'll find out next week . As for why this show performed so badly , I can only assume it had to do with the smaller summer TV viewership and a few untimely preemptions ( the episode seemed to get preempted in more areas than average ) . Only one more week of DS9 ratings , hopefully it 'll be a good one . <p> Did n't ' The Dogs Of War ' air during the week of the Star Wars premiere ? In any case , find out the full report here . <p> Nicole DeBoer , who played Dax for the final season of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , has signed on to two film projects .

She lent her singing and dancing talents to one of the movies musical numbers . In the scene , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine star Rene Auberjonis stars as the creator of a group of perfect children . Scarlett is one of the children . Scarlett says that her experience working on this film was " a lot of work , but a lot of fun !

Expect more tomorrow , when I probably wo n't be in constant danger of falling asleep over my keyboard : - ) . <p> Gene Roddenberry 's " Star Trek " is more than a television series ; it is a phenomenon that has spanned generations . With nine major motion pictures and four television dramas , the appeal of " Star Trek " is as strong as ever . The prime directive of this ambitious special is to boldly relive the greatest adventures of our intrepid captains Kirk , Picard , Sisko and Janeway as they continue to go where no one has gone before . <p> Our new anonymous source , calling himself ' Admiral Leighton , ' has chimed in with what he claims to be a report on some of the stories for the new season currently being developed . <p> Admiral Leighton is apparently the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two ' script .

Lead designer Chris Foster provides us with some new information on the character you 'll be playing as : <p> First off ... you play the Game as Alexander Munro , a security specialist aboard the Voyager . A member of an elite force of away team operatives , Munro will be called upon to defend the ship and its crew from the dangers in a hostile environment . Trapped in an artificial pocket of space by alien beings , Voyaer is disabled and beset on all sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them trapped . <p> He will explore many areas on Voyager , ( yes even the mess hall ... ) , as well as numerous alien craft also trapped within the pocket . The game will be a single-player affair , with Holomatch options ; including Deathmatch , other team games and possibly Multiplayer Co-operative missions outside of the regular single-player game . Munro will have a number of weapons at his disposal throughout the game , some Federation tech ... some not . <p> A few minutes later , programmer Mike Gummelt gave out even more info on the game , including the following gameplay info : <p> The idea for the gameplay now is to have the missions have a variety of gameplay styles , some pure action , some more focused on teamwork , some stealth , and a couple you 're pretty much on your own . Each mission will be a few levels and between each mission there are the main cinematic events on Voyager where you see the progression of the story and your character 's development in respect to his importance and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also in-game cinematic moments in the game at key points of gameplay . <p> Paramount Says Farewell To KelleyChristian ( 3:33 pm CST ) Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga just mailed me this scan of an ad which first appeared in the Tuesday , June 15th issue of the Hollywood Reporter . The ad shows a mountain background , with in the foreground a white band and a picture of DeForest Kelley . Below the picture , it says ' We Mourn The Loss Of One Of Our Brightest Stars . We Will Miss You . ' You can see a full-sized version of the ad by clicking here <p> ' Wars ' Despots Vs . ' Trek ' PopulistsChristian ( 3:32 pm CST ) Laura Hague just mailed me about a new article at Salon , in which the two philosophies of Star Wars and Star Trek are compared to each other . Writer David Brin is rather positive about Star Trek : <p> Yes , " Trek " can at times seem preachy , or turgidly politically correct . For example , every species has to mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only male heroes who are allowed any testosterone are Klingons , because cultural diversity outweighs sexual correctness . ( In other words , it 's OK for them to be macho ' cause it is " their way . " ) " Star Trek " television episodes often devolved into soap operas . Many of the movies were very badly written . <p> Nevertheless , " Trek " tries to grapple with genuine issues , giving complex voices even to its villains and asking hard questions about pitfalls we may face while groping for tomorrow . Anyway , when it comes to portraying human destiny , where would you rather live , assuming you 'll be a normal citizen and no demigod ? In Roddenberry 's Federation ? Or Lucas ' Empire ? <p> The full article ( which actually deals mostly with Star Wars ) has more . Thanks go out to Laura Hague for pointing me to this . <p> This issue comes to you a week late once again , in honor of some stations ' decisions to delay the second half of the Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WGN Channel 9 , home of every sports team whose broadcasts have taken priority over first-run programming for the past seven years . Okay , that 's not why it 's late , but it sounds a lot better than something about me enjoying my vacation a little too much . But we 're back now , with a complete issue of Optical Data Network . <p> I do n't know how it happened , but with only 50% extra time , I 've managed to double the number of NewsBits in this issue . The average issue has about 50 , this one has over 100 ( and it seems like half of them are about software , and half of those about Birth of the Federation ) . Plus the best article about Kelley I could find , links to the rest for those who are interested , along with links to various Kelley tribute sites out there . Rounding out this issue is the UK Airdates article ; the US article now being finished for the summer . I had other things to throw in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now would be a good time to wrap it up before I get yelled at again . <p> If , like me , you did n't yet receive the new issue in your mailbox , you can find it online by going here . <p> While Star Trek : Voyager : Elite Force is still a long way off ( current estimates put it at February 2000 ) , the game will no doubt cause a stir among Trekkies and action gaming fans a-like . Raven Software have a reputation of doing great things with other people 's engines , and with the exception of Take No Prisoners and Mage Slayer , they have always provided clever and interesting games for the public to digest . Let 's just hope that those two blemishes on a perfect record were just part of a negative phase , and that Raven can Kling-on ( outrageous - give this man an award ) to their wonderful reputation . <p> The full preview ( which is wildly inaccurate in some cases ) can be found here <p> The final rating for " Thirty Days " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rating was down 0.1 from last weeks episode , so Voyager got a 2.2 at nr. 98 . What is strange is that Voyagers overnight rating was up 0.3 from last week . <p> Voyager was of course 6th for the hour behind Wbs Charmed that got a 3.1 . But what is really strange is that Voyager was n't the top rated UPN show , the sitcom " Between Brothers " was the top show with a 2.3 . <p> Save Vulcan Fury ... Again ! Christian ( 3:31 pm CST ) YnrohKeeg 's StarTrekGames.Net ( previously Star Trek Gaming Central ) and the Trek Gaming Alliance have relaunched their campaign to save ' Secret Of Vulcan Fury , ' Interplay 's great adventure game . The game was placed on an ' infinite development cycle ' a few months ago , after Interplay ran into financial difficulties , and unfortunately an earlier campaign to save the game was unsuccesfull . However , since DeForest Kelley recently died , and the game might be our chance to see Bones in action one more time , the campaign has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name to the list ! <p> Ron B. Moore Chat TranscriptChristian ( 3:30 pm CST ) The people at the Continuum have put up the transcript of last Thursday 's chat with Ronald B. Moore , Visual Effects Producer for all modern Trek series . Take a look at three quotes from the chat : <p> AL asks : Could you describe what you do as visual effects supervisor ? <p> Ron B. Moore : From the preproduction meeting , the visuals are described in the script , and discussed , so that we can understand what it is exactly that the producers want . My first job is to get as much money as I possibly can from Paramount to create the visuals . What usually happens is they wo n't give me all I ask for . So I want to give as much as I can of the money allotted to create the best visuals I can . Star Trek is really good in that they give me a lot of freedom to design the shots and have them created . There 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coordinate all their work to the final end product . My boss is Peter Lauritson and below him , Dan Curry , and we 're in constant communication . When I complete the work I send a tape to Peter and he cuts the effects into the show . At that point , I find out how much they like them or do n't like them and make corrections . At any given time , I may be working on as many as five episodes . It can get confusing . <p> LostWookie asks : Star Wars - DId Jar Jar ruin it for you too ? <p> Ron B. Moore : I thought the character Jar Jar was an incredible feat . The computer generated shots were terrific . I may be alone , but I like Jar Jar . <p> Kevin Watts asks : How many frames per second are there in Voyager ? <p> Ron B. Moore : It depends . Video is 30 frames a second , but we shoot the show at 24 frames per second . This means we have to convert one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3/2 " to the 24 frames a second images to make them 30 . I would rather do the show at 30 but it 's not up to me . To me , 24 frame a second 3/2 images have a stuttering quality I do n't like . In TNG , I did all my shots at 30 and left them at 30 . So I think the space shots were smoother . One of the problems that we have is that we always see the images on a very expensive , high quality monitor and we 're hard judges . Most likely , most people could n't tell the difference . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:30 pm CST ) -Today at 9:00pm , UPN will be showing Voyager 's ' Latent Image , ' which first aired on the 20th of January .

Christian ( 3:29 pm CST ) It appears my ISP is on the verge of breaking down - over the past hour or so my connection has been more down than up , and I really hope it 'll now function for as long as this update takes . <p> Tomorrow I 'll be incredibly late again , as I have an appointment which will take up most of the evening . There *will* be an update tomorrow , it 'll just be extremely late . <p> We 're currently halfway through production on the Scavenger Base areas . I 've nearly completed the exterior portion of my airlock level , where Munro and others will hopefully get the chance to utilize their Starfleet vac suits for a short spacewalk . <p> Most of the areas of Voyager have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistically roughed up and damaged . <p> Our design team is doing a terrific job of fitting the extremely complex areas from Voyager into the sometimes restrictive limitations of a game engine . Quake3 is the only engine that I would even want to try this in ! <p> Remember that all the latest . plan updates from the Voyager team members can be accessed via our handy TrekFinger service , which you can find right at the top of TrekToday . <p> The latest issue of ( of all things ) Soap Opera Weekly has , as one of their articles , a piece about actors who 've appeared on various SF shows , including ST , DS9 , and Next Generation . Each actor gives a little blurb about the part they played and what they felt about it . Interviewees include Mary Kay Adams , who played Grilka on DS9 . <p> Major thanks go out to Sara Wilcox for this ! <p> Save The German / English VideosChristian ( 1:29 pm CST ) CIC , the European publisher of the Star Trek videos , is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still enough buyers for the double-language German / English videos .

Take a look at what the center will contain : <p> The Presidio Trust , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Army base on prime real estate at the northern end of the city , approved Lucasfilm Ltd.

The facility will be able to accommodate up to 2,500 employees , ' ' allowing us the chance to grow , ' ' said Lucasfilm president Gordon Radley .

ILM operated in Los Angeles from 1975 to ' 77 before heading north after completing Lucas ' Star Wars .

That 's flat from last week 's " Tacking Into the Wind " and the episode that aired this week last year was a rerun ( though this episode did perform slightly below the nearest comparable show -- " Time 's Orphan " of last May ) <p> John Ordover Speaks OutChristian ( 1:26 pm CST ) It 's a new week , and a new set of answers from John Ordover is available at the Pocket Books web site .

I know Greg Cox , Steven Barnes , John Vornholt , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Susan Shwartz , Mike Okuda , and Rick Sternbach have E-mail ( they either post on newsgroups or list their address in the back of their books ) , but how many others use E-mail to communicate with you ? Are there any that do n't have E-mail at all ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Almost all the Trek authors have email - in fact pretty much all of them do by now . <p> Response from : John Ordover Mega-writers are n't interested in writing anything but their own stuff . <p> Query from : Kristina If you write a TOS novel you hope to get published , can you use a specie invented by an other author or do you need their permission ? ( I 'm not talking about a specific charachter . ) <p> Response from : John Ordover Nope . Everything all the authors do is owned by Paramount . However , we do n't normally like to return to aliens created for earlier books . <p> Trek Bad BoysChristian ( 1:26 pm CST ) The high-profile US magazine National Enquirer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Hollywood 's ' bad boys .

In it , she reveals what she liked most about the series : <p> I 'm going to tell you what I loved most about DS9 , and I bet it 's not something the executive producers would ever claim as one of its strengths . I do believe this series offered quality science fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a strong social conscience , and the best music ever on a genre series , but those are n't the reasons I kept watching for all these years . Nor did I watch for the Klingons , the Vulcans , the Bajorans , the presence of TNG 's O'Brien and later Worf , though the familiar Trek trappings made the tapestry stronger for me than I suspect I 'd feel about a similar show set in a different universe . I watched Deep Space Nine for the love stories . <p> I do n't just mean Kira and Odo , or Dax and Worf , or Sisko and Yates , though those romantic pairings added the appeal of slow-developing characterization and sexual tension ( in fact , for a long time I objected to all of those pairings being consummated on the show ) . I mean the familial ties among three generations of Siskos , the inter-species friendship between the Dax symbiont and Klingons who remained loyal through three hosts , the occasionally-glimpsed depth of caring of Quark for his nephew , the passionate friendships between first Bashir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire of Dukat for the love of the Bajoran people . <p> I 've just received the " beta copy " of the Starfleet Command demo . There are a couple of improvements , and one of them is an EXTREMELY COOL improvement . ... Currently , the demo only has two Federation training missions , the Kobayashi Maru scenario , and limited multiplayer capability for the Federation and Klingons . I do n't know when ( or if ) this demo will become available to the public , but I will let you know if I find out about that . <p> If you 're like me and you work nights or ca n't sleep , check out ABC 's World news Now . This is Star Trek week on the overnight broadcast . Tonight they talked about the movies and they did a lousy job . They barely mentioned DeForrest 's death , but maybe the coverage will improve later in the week . <p> ( humorously though , they showed the cooking scene in Generations and the commentator says , " oh , this is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Also , oddly , they used the Caretaker 's banjo music to go with the weather report . <p> According to the official web site , today they 'll be showing an interview with Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) .

Does this mean Voyager wo n't get the full seven seasons ?

The preview contains info on the game 's plot and graphics , and even has the exciting news that there might soon be coming a demo : <p> This title looks like it could be a nice development in the dying adventure market . It 's not strictly an adventure game because you will shoot things , jump around , and generally interact with your environment a lot more than in , say , Grim Fandango . On the other hand , it 's not an action game like Tomb Raider : you will be able to take things slower , explore around , be given lots of direction , and usually not need to jump around like a wild woman . Presto Studios , the game 's developer , is planning to issue a demo in the coming months , and is shooting to release the game this fall . <p> Even more interesting than the actual preview is the fact that it also contains 8 all-new screenshots , which look absolutely fantastic .

" <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:21 pm CST ) My obsession with Star Trek began with the ' Star Trek 25th Anniversary ' game . I 'd already watched several TNG episodes , but I was n't really a fan yet . Then , right after I 'd bought my first CD-Rom drive , I found the magazine ' CD-Rom Now ' in my local bookstore . The cover featured a lovely photo of the Enterprise-D , and I immediately bought it . On the cover disc , I found the first episode of the ' 25th Anniversary , ' called ' Demon 's World . ' I played the first episode , loved it , and later bought the full game . <p> A few months later , I discovered a huge Star Trek section in that same bookstore . I browsed through a few of the books , and finally decided on Alan Dean Foster 's ' Star Trek Logs 1-3 , ' featuring no less than nine Animated Series stories ( though I did n't yet know they came from the animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Trek . Later on I bought the rest of Alan Dean Foster 's books , and when I 'd finished those , I started reading James Blish 's adaptations of the Original Series . <p> A while later , Star Trek suddenly became a lot more popular here in the Netherlands . The new station SBS 6 started showing ' Deep Space Nine , ' and the new golden oldies station ' TV 10 Gold ' would start showing the Original Series . I was perhaps even more excited about the Original Series being shown for the first time than I was about Deep Space Nine starting . The first episode I saw was ' The Corbomite Maneuver ' ( I unfortunately missed ' Where No Man Has Gone Before , ' which I still have not seen ) , and I loved it . Of course , the special effects did n't look as great , but , for the first time , I was finally able to see my heroes as they were meant to be seen . The stories I 'd lived through in my imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over time my love for Star Trek developed , and I started buying more books and computer games . On a local BBS , I even found a full archive of episode reviews and old editions of the ' Dateline : Starfleet ' newsletter , and I spent weeks reading through those . Around December 1997 , the local BBS shut down , and I decided to get online . In this way , I would be able to continue reading all those episode reviews , and I even got a ( badly-written ) book review published in the ' Dateline : Starfleet ' newsletter . I gradually became more and more involved with online fandom , until I reached the stage where I 'm now , following all the latest Deep Space Nine and Voyager developments . The Original Series was ( is ) still very important to me , and , though I think DS9 is the best Trek series ever produced , TOS is the one I 'm the most fond of . <p> This morning , my mailbox was flooded with news announcements of DeForest Kelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in a long time . I was n't there when Gene Roddenberry or Mark Lenard died , and this was the first death of a major Trek figure I experienced . Then I cried . Not only because one of the kindest actors Trek has ever known died , but also because this meant yet another major step towards the Original Series ' final end . <p> De , I 'll miss you , and I 'll treasure the memory of the unforgettable Bones McCoy in the greatest television series the world has ever known . <p> Friday June 11 , 1999 <p> Warp Drive Possible ? Christian ( 3:29 pm CST ) Trek Galaxy just let me know about a new article on the BBC Web site , dealing with new mathematic research which brings the possibility of a warp drive one step closer : <p> In Star Trek , the USS Enterprise is powered by what is called a " warp drive " and at the moment only Paramount Pictures know its secrets . <p> But new , highly mathematical research may have brought us one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starship capable of travelling faster than the speed of light . <p> The analysis of the concept of a warp drive by Chris Van Den Broeck of the Catholic University in Leuven , Belgium means that building a starship Enterprise is a little closer . <p> The full article has more about this - I wo n't even try to begin to understand all of it .

March and April were n't that important for DS9 , and nothing much really happened in those months , as you can read in the full report . The May Sweeps were a lot more important , though , and fortunately the series did rather well then : <p> This was DS9 's strongest sweeps in a while and in respect to the current season , one of DS9 's best May Sweeps showing of the series ' run . Meanwhile , DS9 's former tough competition , Xena and Hercules , have disappeared from the charts . <p> For what is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode during this period actually beat the comparable episode from the season before . " When It Rains ... " barely defeated the episode from a year ago , " Profit and Lace , " and " Strange Bedfellows " tied DS9 's year ago mark from " The Reckoning . " Altogether , this adds up to a very good month . In fact , had " Tacking Into the Wind " been able to best " Time 's Orphan " ' s 4.6 , this May would have outperformed last season 's May Sweeps . <p> ... <p> On an even better note , for the first time in DS9 's run , May 's average was higher than February 's . This is no doubt due to the finale arc , and shows that DS9 had quite a bit of strength to pull viewers back in towards the end . <p> Read more about DS9 's merry may month in the full report . As should have been obvious for everyone following Voyager 's ratings over the past few weeks , the fourth Trek series did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read this report if you 've been diagnosed with a depression disorder or just do n't want to see ugliness . This May Sweeps was Voyager 's worst overall period in its entire run and was generally extremely disappointing . <p> Every show during this period performed well below their year-ago marks , most by a margin of nearly a full point . The highest mark achieved by an episode this season was a 3.3 . Last season , the *lowest* rating earned by an episode during this period was a 3.8 . As a result , Season 5 's May also performed well below Season 4 's May . <p> Let 's all hope Voyager will do better next year - otherwise Voyager 's future may be cut short dramatically .

In his review , he mentions that he thought ' What You Leave Behind ' was somewhat disappointing , and he awards the episode a 7 . Lynch ends his review with the following farewell to fans of his reviews : <p> And with DS9 's goodbye comes one of my own . I bade farewell to TNG reviews five years ago , but knew I was n't going away for good--after all , there was DS9 as an ongoing series . This time , after eleven years , it 's likely really it . ( Before you ask ... yes , I 'll do a season-7 wrap-up later this summer . A full DS9 retrospective is possible , but if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication rather than virtual . ) <p> I started reviewing TNG in my late teens . I was in college , single , enjoying this new-to-me concept called e-mail and Usenet , televised science fiction was rare , and I decided that if my roommate could do reviews , I could damn well manage it on my own . : - ) Now I 'm less than a year away from my thirties , I 'm out of school ( well , out of student-hood , anyway ) , I 'm happily married ( coming up on eight years ) , reviewers are atop every rock ( and in a few cases under them : - ) ) , everyone not currently orbiting the planet is online , SFTV is too plentiful for anyone with an actual life to keep up with completely , and it 's time to go . <p> ... <p> And as before , I 'd like to thank anyone who 's taken enough of an interest in these reviews to keep me writing them . I said some of this in 1993 , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me realize where my own flaws as a reviewer and as a writer lie--they have given me ideas to chew upon , praise when I most needed it , bubble-bursting reality when I most ( and sometimes least ) needed it , job offers once or twice , mountains of e-mail I have yet to answer some of : - ) , and in some cases have been more of an influence in this most recent one-third of my life than you may realize . I thank you for your interest , your tolerance , and your enthusiasm . <p> As Kai Opaka said long ago , " Your pagh and mine ... will cross again . " For now , though ... s'long , folks . <p> It 's certainly sad to see Tim Lynch go - one of the reasons I actually got on the internet was actually to still be able to catch his reviews , as the local BBS from which I 'd previously gotten them closed down .

In the rather long article , Fletcher talks about the character of Winn , her own acting career , and her meetings with Trek fans : <p> " I have n't done many conventions , I 've only done two or three , it 's just been amazing , " Fletcher says . " One of my sons drove me once to the one in Pasadena . He and I were both astonished at the length of time people would stand in line to get a picture . I was sort of amazed ! I have n't done many conventions so I 'm not used to it ; I was sort of blown away by it .

I do n't get any fan letters from people in jail from Star Trek . But fans of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest are writing from all kinds of institutions . " The actress laughs .

' Gepetto ' is the first original musical being produced specifically for ' The Wonderful World of Disney , ' and is scheduled to air during the 1999-2000 television season on ABC . Interesting for Star Trek fans is that the musical will feature Brent Spiner ( Data ) as the puppeteer Stromboli , RenT Auberjonois ( Odo ) as Professor Buonragazzo who makes nothing but perfect children in Idyllia , and Scarlett Pomers ( Naomi Wildman ) , presumably as one of the children . You can find the full press release here - thanks go out to Richard Rafter for pointing me to this . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 2:54 pm CST ) -In the US , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the TOS first-season episode ' A Taste Of Armageddon ' at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm .

Christian ( 2:53 pm CST ) Well , I 'm still late , but I 'm not as incredibly late as I was over the past few days . Hopefully I 'll finally be able to get back to regular updating times again tomorrow . <p> Star Trek News has just put up a special rumour page for Voyager 's sixth season . The report contains info on several upcoming episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November : <p> This year , Voyager 's staff is making the yearly two-hour movie for November Sweeps as opposed to February Sweeps . Plot details are unknown , but will likely add fuel to the fire of speculation that Voyager may be making a quick return to Earth this season . <p> According to a interview in the May 99 issue of Dreamwatch magazine , Chase Masterson , Leeta from Deep Space Nine and host for the Sci-fI Channel 's canceled Sci-Fi Entertainment show , is planning on using her connections with the Sci-Fi Channel to bring to fruition a project very close to her heart . <p> " I 've made a proposal to them to do a one-hour Deep Space Nine retrospective . " Masterson told Dreamwatch reporter Paul Simpson " Isnt this great ? I hope it happens . It would be a look on seven years of wonderful television . It would air on the Sci-Fi Channel and probabily be released on video . I would produce and host it , but that 's not the reason i want to do it . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , to be honest , I 'm just the person to put it together having been on the inside and having the relationship with the Sci-Fi Channel and the fact I 'm beginning to produce . What I 'd like is to bring a bit of what this series has meant home in a cohesive show . I we do it right , there will be a lot of tears " . <p> Major thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for reporting this . Dreamwatch can be found online by going here . <p> The final rating for the rerun of Nothing Human is in , and it does n't look good . Voyager only got a 2.3 and was nr. 99 . <p> Voyager was 6th for the night behind WBs Charmed that got a 3.0 . Also 7 Days was 6th with a 1.9 . ( Behind Dawsons Creek that got a 2.5 ) This does n't look good for this summer 's reruns . Voyager lowest rerun rating is 1.9 , some of this summer 's ratings will problaly be lower than that . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Dogs of War had a few moments of labored comedy , as when the Nagus sent his staticky message , but most of the humor sprung naturally from the premise of Quark 's expecting to be named Nagus himself , and his indignation at the kinder , gentler Feringinar than Zek and Moogie had instituted . Quark , like Worf and Spock , seems perpetually put in situations where he 's in tensions with the principles of his home world , although he wants nothing more than to be a " good Ferengi . " I wonder if his This far , no farther ! line offered a conscious echo of Picard 's similar speech in Star Trek First Contact ? Certainly Quark 's referring to economic reforms as a disease echoes the Founders illness ( an infection caused for political reasons ) . I certainly did n't expect to see a parallel between Quark and Damar , but both are true believers , in revolt against a new regime on their planet . But where Quark demands free markets , unconstrained by concern for worker 's rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . <p> In the full review he awards the episode a B+ , which is exactly the same as his average grade for the series finale . Holman thought the finale was a fitting end to the series : <p> What You Leave Behind , in bringing DS9 to a close , is spectacular , sweeping in scope , frequently moving , idiosyncratic and not 100% satisfying -- much like the series itself . Certainly it brought the Dominion War -- and Cardassia 's relationship with the Dominion -- to an impressive , fitting conclusion , with the first half of WYLB effectively cutting between the tensions and battles in outer space with the deteriorating conditions on Cardassia . Like the destruction of the first Defiant , the space battles were gorgeously rendered , although I think the battle scene from The Sacrifice of Angels built more suspense and gave a better sense of what the strategies were , than the one here . <p> Andrew J. Robinson 's Garak had some terrific moments here -- I 'm glad that WYLB was able to give Garak some closure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so evil and frightening as she was here , and I 'm glad WYLB did n't take her off the hook for the Dominion 's actions . Speaking of the changelings , it 's interesting how , in episodes like The Search and Behind the Lines , when Odo would link with them , they 'd have a powerful effect his thinking ; but now , it is Odo who 's influencing them . It 's as though Odo , in being a solid and loving Kira , has finally grown to maturity . His climatic tuxedo was one of the episode 's most lovely and memorable details . <p> Highly Illegal HappeningsChristian ( 3:23 pm CST ) Without any doubt Paramount wo n't like this , but the LCARS Communications Network has put up the ENTIRE Deep Spadce Nine finale for online viewing . The episode is broken into three parts , each 30 minutes long , for which the Real Audio plug-in is required . The video runs in a really small resolution , though , so if you have n't yet seen it I 'd strongly advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live . Having said all this , if you are n't troubled by the illegality or the low quality , you can find the episode here . You probably should n't click this link if you 're a Paramount lawyer , though : - ) . Thanks go out to Star Trek Fans for the link . <p> 2000 Star Trek Book ScheduleChristian ( 3:21 pm CST ) David Henderson sends word that he 's put up the tentative ( i.e. not final ) Star Trek book schedule for the year 2000 , courtesy of Pocket Books editor John Ordover , which is still subject to change . January looks to be an especially interesting month , as that is when Pocket Books will be publishing ' Hamlet ' in the Klingon Language . John Ordover later explained why that book suddenly popped up : <p> Alert viewers will realize that the Milennium books got pushed back creating a hole in the schedule that had to be filled quickly. : ) <p> The actual schedule can be found here , while John Ordover 's comments on the schedule can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pm CST ) Yesterday , Voyager writer Ronald D. Moore finally answered some questions at his AOL folder again , giving us some unique insight into the inner workings of the Trek universe . Take a look at three of his most interesting responses : <p> Actually , do you think it will be difficult to write on a " Every Week Is a New Adventure " Show again ? ? <p> Not at all . Doing episodic adventures is actually much easier than trying to maintain continuity across the season . Writing the final arc of DS9 was a very difficult and taxing experience and while I 'd love to try it again ( on an even larger level , say , a true sci-fi serial ) it 's a nice change of pace to get away from it for a while . <p> Since you had n't been in the Voyager loop , officially , how did you prepare for writing your first Voyager story ? In both TNG and DS9 you came in , as a staff writer , in the 3rd season , I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 100 eps in the can , did you watch past episodes ( any or all ) , or did TPTB give you a synopsis of each character 's development and the ship 's past encounters of interest ? Did your preparation for writing this series differ from preparing to write for either TNG or DS9 , and if so , how ? <p> I 've been watching the tapes , but mostly I 've been talking to the VOY writers for a couple of months now about the show and the direction they want to take the characters . On all three series , I 've pretty much just jumped into the process and learned the show as I worked on it . On DS9 , my first script was the season three opener and now my first show will be the second episode of the year . I 've found that sitting down and actually writing the character voices and learning what they 're all about is the quickest and most rewarding way of discovering the show . <p> Why was Jadzia excluded from Worf 's Memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ST Execs ? <p> In order to use a clip of someone from a previous episode , you first have to obtain permission from the actor in question . Usually permission is routinely granted and a nominal fee is paid ( unlike writers and directors , who receive a flat fee and do n't get the option of saying yes or no ) . In this case , we were unable to obtain permission . And no , we were n't real happy about it . <p> Certainly that last response is interesting - why in heaven 's name did n't Terry Farrel want to be included in the final episode ? In any case , find more of Ron Moore 's responses here . <p> " The story is a Next Generation sequel to the classic Trek episode ' Wolf in the Fold , ' " Sniegoski said . " That was the one written by horror writer Robert Bloch and it was about an energy creature that turns out to be Jack The Ripper . <p> CorrectionChristian ( 3:19 pm CST ) Yesterday in ' Happy Birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Star Trek : The Motion Picture .

Unfortunately , this hilarious new movie has n't nearly received as much attention as the recent ' Trekkies ' documentary , even though William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) stars in the film . Fortunately , Dennis Sabre just sent me a review of the film , in which he tells you everything you should know about it : <p> " Free Enterprise " is a low-budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altman and film editor Robert Meyer Burnett ( who also directed ) , both of whom fiercely deny that the film is in any way autobiographical . Their love of Star Trek and science fiction film is evident in every scene of this quirky , sometimes bizarre tale , which seems to have been made without any cooperation ( or interference ) from Paramount Studios . William Shatner shows himself to be a heretofore unsuspected comic genius who takes delight in poking fun at his public image . And his rap music version of Marc Antony 's " Et tu , Brute " speech had me laughing so hard that I 'll have to watch the movie again just to see if I missed anything . <p> Find the full review right here !

However , the WSJ observed that plans to produce a new Star Trek movie with Paramount have stalled . Imax co-CEO Brad Wechsler told the newspaper , " We have a great script , but we were not able to come to a business deal with Paramount . " <p> This certainly is interesting !

Christian ( 3:36 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green at AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz has put up an exclusive interview with Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) . In the interview , Mulgrew confirms that she 's signed on for Voyager 's seventh season . More interesting , however , are her thoughts on the future of Trek : <p> Though she said she hoped to see a love interest for Janeway this year , the actress does not believe Voyager will be returning to the Alpha Quadrant during the season . " I do n't think we 're going to get back to the Federation . Do n't put a period on the end of that , but I think Paramount does not wish us to return . " <p> Mulgrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Star Trek show , but said , " In this year that we stand alone , I want it to be really great . It 's like being a member of a large family and suddenly everyone goes away to college , and you have the house to yourself . " <p> I find the ' in this year ' part especially interesting - does thhis mean we 'll have a new series premiere just twelve months from now ? That would certainly be extremely great news ( and , yes , it would mean that TrekToday was horribly wrong with its predictions just a few days ago . Sigh . : - ( ) .

One of the quotes has Alexander Siddig ( Dr. Julian Bashir ) talking about the ( i 'm ) possibility of DS9 movies : <p> " I ca n't imagine that doing Deep Space Nine movies wouid make any sense at the moment , After all , The Next Generation is still flavour of the month , and we 're so unlike TNG . I think maybe Paramount will wheel us out 20 years down the road for a revisit . If they get really ambitious , they 'll only wait 10 years - perhaps after people discover us in repeats and appreciate the show more than they do now . That worked very well for the original Star Trek . " <p> The full article ( which is based on articles from ' Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found by clicking here . <p> This week was a bit of an anticlimax after last week 's impressive BBC2 TNG and Sky VOY ratings . TNG dropped from #9 to #22 , losing a fair amount of viewers ( on the list , the episode names appear to have been tangled up somewhere though ! ) . DS9 's double bill failed to be ranked ( as usual ) , and Voyager returned but without the bang we 'd hoped for - it got a mediocre #20 ranking , 2.51m viewers . <p> Over on Sky , Voyager dropped to an average #7 ranking , and a slightly low 0.66m audience figure . However it cheerfully stuck in the top ten with the ( other ! ) popular series like The Simpsons and ER . <p> On a 4 star scale , I 'll call this one ( * * * ) . I did enjoy it , but as cliffhangers go I would have preferred more uncertainty , more variables--and more on the line . <p> Since this is the season finale , let me say that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Season 3 was my sentimental favorite , but I think this season may have been one of its creative best . They took more chances , some pretty controversial , and though not every one paid off I appreciated the effort , and when it paid off it paid off big . <p> I also enjoyed the greater focus on the ensemble this year , and the attention paid to minor characters like Naomi Wildman . I give a lot of credit to Brannon Braga , who--and I say this with all the intensity of a fan who damn near left Voyager completely in season 4--made me a fan again . Thank you . I wish the ship and crew and actors and staff all success in season six . The addition of Ron Moore is very welcome , and I hope he can bring to Voyager the same enthusiasm and passion and genius he lavished on DS9 . <p> Naomi Wildman Back Next SeasonChristian ( 3:29 pm CST ) Of course it was to be expected , but the Official Scarlett Pomers Homepage is reporting that Scarlett Pomers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi Wildman . She is currently busy with her summer projects , which means she probably wo n't be appearing in ' Equinox , Part Two , ' but more news about her season six episodes should be appearing soon . <p> TrekWeb DS9 Finale ReviewChristian ( 3:28 pm CST ) Steve Perry at TrekWeb has put up what is probably the most negative review of ' What You Leave Behind ' yet , in which the episode is awarded no more than a C. Take a look at how Perry begins with his review : <p> Many of you are going to hate me for this review . I can only say one thing : I love DS9 . This and Homicide were the only two shows I CARED about . So when I get mad at the show , I get mad because I realize what it could have been . What it could have been is the greatest TV show in American history . This finale is a good example of why it is n't . <p> ... <p> This episode is an idiotic mess . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode , but it 's the large , painfully obvious flaws that bother me . These are professional writers who make quite a good bit of money writing it . So pardon me if I seem offended by how bad What You Leave Behind was . I just ca n't comprehend how , with so much potential , they just threw it all a way in an episode that can even get the basic tenets of storytelling right . <p> Salt Lake City Convention ReportChristian ( 3:27 pm CST ) Last weekend , a Star Trek convention apparently took place in Salt Lake City , and Salt Lake City Tribune writer Connie Coyne has written a report of the meeting . As is almost usual , the writer does n't seem to think Trekkers are on the same level as normal humans : <p> They are not exactly Lost In Space . But most of them are way beyond the point of Contact that Carl Sagan had in mind . <p> Think of them as having boldly gone where few men and women have gone before -- as inhabiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of TV 's " Star Trek " series or too many days sitting outside in bad weather waiting for " Star Wars Episode I " tickets . <p> Shatner On ' Politically Incorrect'Christian ( 3:27 pm CST ) Tomorrow morning , William Shatner ( James T.

In the interview , Bethke talks about their involvement with the fans on the internet : <p> Some companies seem to stay well away from the Internet , others get very involved . Do you think it is useful to be so accessible to gamers ? Absolutely . Being involved with the fan base is a central part of my day &amp; development philosophy . We are making a consumer product that people do not have to buy . It has got to be something they want and is fun . I do not know of a better way than asking them and listening to them .

Ted Witt starts out rather positively with his review : <p> I find myself in a very sad and sentimental spirit at the end of DS9 . I , for one , am actually sad to see the series end--it is , without a doubt , the best extended Trek ever done . I know that the debates , the arguments , and the opinions , concerning that statement will probably not be conclusive , and will probably rage for years ... Deep Space Nine was a series that redefined sci-fi in general , and Star Trek in particular . It was often darker , moodier , grittier , and seemingly less in tune with the sacred vision of the great bird of the galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinions for others to continue ! <p> " What You Leave Behind " was an excellent finale for the series . I am left wanting more . From a standpoint of wanting the viewer and the fan ( and even the occasional reviewer ) to have more adventures , I have to say that " What You Leave Behind " succeeds on many levels . The episode was a definate end , but leaving open the possiblility for more--a movie , a Babylon 5 like two hour TV movie , a miniseries , whatever--the options are still open . And from that point of view , the finale was clearly a winner . <p> Later on , however , he finds more problems with the episode , and ends up awarding it a B- .

Unfortunately , reviewer Trent C. Ward is n't all that positive about the game : <p> I guess what bothers most about Birth of the Federation is that it could have been a really great game . If the designers had made sure that the gameplay worked well throughout , if they had tried to actually design a new game system instead of copying what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that the AI handled situations in a realistic fashion , this would be a must-own title . As it is , Birth of the Federation is nothing more than a frustrating copy of earlier turn based strategy games that does n't work like it 's supposed to .

Online has written an article about the Deep Space Nine finale , ' What You Leave Behind . ' The article does n't include the usual quotes from the producers , writers , and actors , but instead ' Trekkies ' director Roger Nygard and fan Gabriel Koerner talk about the show : <p> " This is the first time in Star Trek history that the story is really over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was featured in Trekkies--and who already saw the final episode .

I have always considered " Deep Space Nine " to be my Star Trek . Do n't get me wrong - I loved what came before it , watched those shows just as obsessively , became hooked on " Trek " through them . But this one I watched from start to finish , from definite beginning to definite end . This one had Kira Nerys , the likes of whom I had never seen before and may never see again .

Pierce . In the interview , Shimerman talks about how he always was a great Star Trek fan , and that he will miss the show now that it 's over : <p> " It was very sad . Those were very teary-eyed days which was especially hard for people in rubber , " Shimmerman said . " As the time came to an end , it was very sad to see our friends making plans to go other places to continue on with their lives and we would n't be part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters were going to be put on the shelves and sort of put in mothballs who knows ? maybe forever . <p> " I know that when I took the makeup off for the very last time and the head was removed and I was alone for a moment , a little tiny voice in the back of my head a little Quark voice said , ' Do n't kill me ! ' And I felt for the little voice . He had existed for seven years and had a wonderful life , and it was sort of a shame to see him be put in mothballs . But at the same time , people have to move on . " <p> New Radio Trek BroadcastChristian ( 3:33 pm CST ) I just noticed at the German Star Trek Index that a new edition of the online ' Radio Trek ' show is now available .

' book . Check out three of the most interesting quotes from the chat : <p> Teilani asks : I just finished " Get A Life , " as well . It was so good - and quite hilarious at times ! Now that your research is done , are you still sporting disguises for convention attendance purposes ? <p> William Shatner : I sport disguises all the time . I have fooled my children . My wife . and even my dog . But of course , you know , I 'm kidding . And I 'm through with disguises from now on in . The real me from now on . People should watch for me to come in from the sky , from underground or materialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If somehow they could bring Kirk back into the current Star Trek movie storyline ( hey , Spock did it ! ) , would you accept the role ? <p> William Shatner : If it was a well written return .... in fact , they can call it " The Return . " I know where they can get a good story . <p> leprocks asks : I heard that you do n't sign autographs , is this true ? <p> William Shatner : No it 's not true . I do sign autographs , but frequently the people who come up to me have professional pictures that I am almost sure they 're going to sell . That strikes a false note in me so I 'm always adjudicating to sign for a genuine fan -- which I would like to do -- or not sign for someone who 's there for commercial reasons . <p> Sacbeat DS9 ReviewChristian ( 3:31 pm CST ) Rick Kushman at the Sacbeat has written an article looking at the end of Deep Space Nine . The review of course contains the obligatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting is where Kushman starts talking about the future of Trek : <p> Viewers being less than thrilled seems to be the case lately with many " Trek " adventures . Maybe because there have been so many of them that satisfying , creative endings are hard to find . Maybe we 've just been spoiled by so many truly thoughtful episodes . <p> And that 's why the pitch here is to play out the next season or two of " Voyager , " a series with a sometimes too-bland crew that can still have stellar episodes , and then put the TV series in space dock for awhile . <p> When it comes back -- and we 're just trying out a thought here -- let it come back with a new Enterprise in an even more distant future . The galaxy could be changed again . There could be techno-gizmos , time travel perhaps . There could be a new -- possibly nonhuman -- captain . There would be new life , new civilizations , and new , never split-before infinitives to be explored . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of Trek , which , while I do n't agree with them , are still rather interesting . <p> DS9 Ending VideosChristian ( 3:31 pm CST ) SCIFI Headquarters has put up two video fragments dealing with the ending of Deep Space Nine , one from E ! News , and the other from Entertainment Tonight . Both clips are in Real G2 format , so they should n't take too long to download . <p> It 's been fun , has n't it ? For seven years , we 've hung out next to this stable wormhole thing , watching our friends grow and change . It 's been a lovely , grandiose ride , albeit one that was n't for everyone . Indeed , one of the key appeals of " Deep Space Nine " is that it always tried to be different , edgy and character-driven , to give shadings to a universe that was still often rendered in black and white . This may have caused some to assign it the dubious label of the " middle child " of " Trek " -dom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grander , larger vision in mind , a bigger story to tell and a vast canvas to tell it on . For my money , it 's the best of them all . Below , we look back on some of the people and moments that made it so . <p> ... <p> Best recurring character : It 's a testament to " DS9 's " depth that there are so many good candidates for this one . So , we 'll just opt to go with that goofy cult favorite who 's never said a word - Morn . He 's been around since the beginning , he has his own fan club , and he 's had his name in an episode title . Pretty good for a guy in a big foam head with no lines . <p> The full retrospective , written by Sarah Kuhn , also features categories such as ' Best Episode , ' ' Best Couplings ' and ' Hottest Babe ( male and female ) ' - find it all here . <p> Jammer 's ' Warhead ' ReviewChristian ( 3:27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Voyager 's ' Warhead , ' which he did n't deem worthy of receiving more than 2 out of 4 stars : <p> It 's moments like " Warhead " that make me wonder how much life the Star Trek franchise has left in it . With the end of DS9--the most challenging incarnation of the franchise--now upon us , I 'm realizing that Voyager will be all that 's left to speak for Trek--for a while , anyway . An episode like this makes me wonder how much is left to be said , because what 's said here has been said many times before--and " Warhead " does n't find a particularly riveting new spin on the material . <p> " Warhead " plays like an " all-new " remake of some lost TOS episode . True , it 's updated with the Voyager quota of technical jargon and current production values . But it seems like we 're covering ground that was covered back in 1967 . There 's a scene here where the Voyager away team beams down to a planet surface for investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TOS planets were obviously sets . It 's like meeting an old friend--the fake-looking planet . And , theme-wise , it 's almost as if a Trek script were put into a time capsule long ago and recently rediscovered and run through production . Are the themes " universal " ? Maybe . Are they challenging ? Not particularly . Are they familiar ? You 'd better believe it . <p> We are currently working on our PlayStation plans . Some our games really are inappropriate for the console either because of controller issues or code complexity . However , we will be making PlayStation games in the future , including ones that the PC people wo n't be able to play . <p> ' Free Enterprise ' Premiere ReportChristian ( 3:25 pm CST ) UltimateTV'sColin Campbell has written a report of the ' Free Enterprise ' premiere , which took place in Los Angeles yesterday . The premiere was of course attended by writer Mark A. Altman and director Robert Meyer Burnett , but also by co-star William Shatner . The report describes how writer Altman is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> For writer and producer Altman , working with childhood icon Shatner was a dream come true . " Bill came through with a comic tour de force , " Altman said , with a somewhat awestruck look on his face as he worked the red carpet media line on premiere night . So what about this " art imitating life " circle between " Free Enterprise " and the real story of Altman and Burnett ? " To be here fulfilling a dream is just great , " Altman said , unable to stop smiling even as nervous P.R . people pulled him inside the theater for the start of the premiere . <p> ' Insurrection ' Canada PerformanceChristian ( 3:24 pm CST ) The Canadian site Jam ! Showbiz has put up the Canadian Rental &amp; Sales charts for both DVD and VHS . The film is doing quite well on DVD - it occupies the top spot on the rental charts and is no.2 in sales . The VHS has unfortunately already dropped to the 7th place on the rental charts . <p> New York Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the New York Daily News has written a short review of the Deep Space Nine finale , ' What You Leave Behind . ' Bianculli starts by saying that this is the first Trek series to really end ( as both TOS and TNG still lived on after the series ) , and then talks about about the finale itself : <p> The episode gives some of the best scenes to Nana Visitor as Kira Nerys and Rene Auberjonois as Odo , with Avery Brooks as Sisko finally fulfilling his long-prophesized destiny . Special effects during the extensive battle sequences , with fleets of starships attacking each other in outer space , are unprecedentedly complex for " Star Trek . " <p> Before it 's over , each main character is given some sense of closure ( some more final than others ) . Fans of the show should enjoy a similar sense of closure , and say goodbye to a series whose demise was understandable and unavoidable . <p> For though " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " lived long , it never really prospered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the birthday of David Marc Worden , who was one of the actors who portrayed Alexander Rozhenko , and today 's the birthday of Robert Lansing , who guest-starred on the TOS ' Assignment : Earth ' episode as Gary Seven . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:22 pm CST ) -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The Abandoned ' at 16:00 BST , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Lifesigns .

At the same time , I put in my ISDN card for about the fifth attempt at making it work , and , miraculously , both Win ' 98 and the ISDN card installed perfectly !

Bond was extremely impressed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREE ENTERPRISE is a similar wake-up call about the pitfalls of fandom , but it offers up a much more positive message and manages to both lampoon and celebrate the exigencies of STAR TREK fans ( and science fiction fans in general ) in a far more uplifting way . <p> FREE ENTERPRISE has to be the first movie to address that forgotten but fiscally potent demographic of thirtysomethings who grew up on STAR TREK , STAR WARS and other sci fi products of the ' 60s and ' 70s , but who do n't haunt conventions , dress up in Starfleet uniforms or Klingon make-ups , or stalk their favorite TREK actors . They just buy a lot of toys and DVDs . It 's a lot closer to my experience of being a science fiction fan than the one depicted in TREKKIES . <p> Much as I enjoyed the complex storytelling of " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , " and greatly as it pains me to write this , tonight 's two-hour series finale disappoints . <p> In " What You Leave Behind , " airing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers juggle multiple storylines , bring closure to several relationships -- and then there 's the little matter of wrapping up the war between the Federation and the Dominion alliance . Even over the course of two hours , that 's a lot to do . <p> The last " DS9 " is similar to the final episode of " Star Trek : The Next Generation " in that both give their respective series a sense of closure while allowing for the continuation of future adventures . However , given the unlikelihood of a " DS9 " movie , a more concrete ending would have made sense . <p> Philadelphia DS9 Finale Follow-UpChristian ( 3:19 pm CST ) A few days ago , I reported here that viewers in Philadelphia would not be able to see the Deep Space Nine finale in one piece . Jesse Koehler just sent in a clarification of the matter : <p> UPN 57 incorrectly listed on their website that the DS9 finale would air at 10:00 PM on Wednesday , June 2 for one hour . This information was also incorrectly listed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV guide for this week , and in the newspaper a syndicated repeat of TNG was listed for the 2nd of June 10 to 11 PM slot ( UPN 57 typically airs repeats TNG at 1:00 AM , but I guess since they could n't air the DS9 finale in a one-hour slot they threw a TNG rerun in there ) . <p> I left the TV on last night at ten after watching the Voyager repeat and there it was , a TNG repeat from TNG 's third season . The actual time for the DS9 finale ( as it has been correctly advertised as a two hour finale on UPN 57 ) here in Philadelphia is Sunday , June 6 from 8 to 10 PM . I checked UPN 57 's website today and this information is reflected there , as it is at gist 's site . <p> Well , it looks like Philadelphia viewers will actually be able to see the finale in the way it was intended , as a two-hour movie .

' The review is actually more of a review of the entire series , which the reviewer is n't as fond of as some of the other fans : <p> What does the show ending mean ? <p> It means for the first time people might take a clear-eyed look at DS9 . It was unfairly sandwiched in between THE NEXT GENERATION and VOYAGER and never got the chance it deserved . What that reassessment will eventually come to is anyone 's guess , though I suspect it will be ranked nearly as high as THE NEXT GENERATION , and light years ahead of VOYAGER -- but is it as great as the classic series , as many fans are now starting to claim ? <p> In my estimation , no . It was too slow out of the gate , and despite this graceful sign-off , too uneven in its execution . But as for what it left behind , there were more than a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of why the reviewer does n't seem to think DS9 is the greatest Trek ever can be found in the full review - almost needless to say , I do n't agree with him ; - ) . <p> " Tacking Into the Wind " continued the Final Chapter 's strong trend , staying above the season average at a 4.4 , again ranking 12th . That rating puts it just above last week 's 4.3 showing from " When It Rains ... " and slightly down from last year 's " Time 's Orphan " which nabbed a 4.6 . With that number , DS9 finished May Sweeps just barely off last year 's mark , down just over 1% . ... With this May 's average of roughly a 4.4 , DS9 actually gained viewers since February -- something DS9 has never done before over the February-May period . <p> More good news can be found in the full ' Tacking Into The Wind ' report . Unfortunately , the news is not nearly as good in the Final Ratings report for ' Equinox , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it : the ratings for " Equinox " stink . The episode performed at an extremely disappointing 3.2 rating , 5 share . That 's *down* from last week 's " Warhead " by a tenth of a point and off last year 's " Hope and Fear " ( 4.1 ) by nearly a full point . That 3.2 rating is actually one of the lowest ratings this year . <p> ... <p> This rating is bad . Very bad . As to why it 's bad , I have very little idea . I have two theories : either UPN lost a bunch of affiliates in March and April or with the start of the baseball season , the UPN local affiliates started preempting the UPN lineup on a massive scale , dropping the national ratings . My money is on the second , but either way , UPN has to take a lot of the blame . I 'll go into how UPN has hurt Voyager in the season report but suffice it to say Voyager would probably be doing a whole lot better if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever asks where the new Trek series should go , " syndication " is the answer . In any case , more on these ratings and the ratings for all of Voyager 's 5th season in the upcoming Voyager May and Season 5 reports . <p> Shimerman Goes Against RacismChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) Kevin Dilmore at the Star Trek Continuum has written a feature article dealing with Armin Shimerman , the actor best known for his role as Quark on Deep Space Nine . In the article , Shimerman points out an unfortunately very true thing about the Star Trek series : <p> " Humans of the Federation are the master race and everyone else is relegated to living with certain characteristics , " he explains . " Romulans are backstabbers ; Klingons are violent ; Cardassians are conspiratorial and traitorous . In the hierarchy of respect in the Star Trek universe , who gets the most ? Vulcans are greatly respected for their nobility , and their only makeup is pointed ears . The more makeup you wear , the less respect you get . Ferengi are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can read how precisely Shimerman has attempted to go against this ' speciesism ' in the article . <p> Beltran Crosses OverChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) Yesterday , ABD broadcasted the annual Alma Awards ceremony , which deal with Latin-American people in the entertainment business . Manesh Pillai just informed me about this , and reported that Robert Beltran ( Chakotay ) had actually been nominated for an Outstanding Individual Performance in a Television Series in a Crossover Role award . Unfortunately for Beltran , the award went to Jimmy Smits ( from " NYPD Blue " ) , but at least Beltran was nominated . Thanks go out to Manesh Pillai for reporting this ! <p> Related to this , a press release from the San Antonio CineFestival reports that the theme for this year 's festival will be ' Latinas in Film .

The ' Mirror , Mirror ' figures are almost the last 9 " figures Playmates will ever be releasing , but , according to reviewer Jeff Bond , these two have been done pretty well : <p> Of all the bizarre worlds the old STAR TREK series showed us , few were as entertaining as the sleazy , piratical alternate reality of Jerome Bixby 's episode " Mirror , Mirror . " Playmates Toys has been issuing an exclusive line of 9 " action figures based on the episode since last fall , which has so far included Captain Kirk , Mr. Spock , Dr. McCoy and Lt. Uhura in mirror universe garb . Now the line concludes with two of the coolest figures yet , Security Chief Sulu and Lt. Marlena Moreau , the episode 's " Captain 's woman .

We had talked to them about this way back when and they had said , ' Sure , you can do the last six episodes , ten episodes as one big story . ' Somewhere around episode two or three they were like , ' Wait a minute , this is serialized . ' We said , ' Oh well , ' and kept going . " <p> Later on , writer Hans Beimler speaks some very true words about Deep Space Nine being more like the Original Series than like the Next Generation : <p> " To me , " says Beimler , " this show follows the tradition of the original series more than THE NEXT GENERATION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tradition of the original series , but I think in actuality we are .

Even Riker . There 's a few things you can tell me about Riker and Troi , but not that many . I think that in DEEP SPACE NINE , each one of these characters is well defined and complicated . We could talk pretty substantially about each of them . The same is true of the semi-regulars , like Weyoun , Damar , Kai Winn and so forth .

You can find the full report here , but remember that none of this has been confirmed yet ! <p> TrekToday is n't the only site to have a season six report up , as TrekWeb also just posted a report from insider Dangermouse . In the report , he also provides info on Voyager 's sixth season and on the new Trek series - be warned , though , that some of Dangermouse 's report conflicts with Lord Spock 's report , which just goes to show again that you should never fully believe any of these rumours until fully confirmed .

UPN and WBs tied for the night , they also did that yesterday , but WB will ofcourse beat UPN when the final rating is in , since WBs can be seen in more areas than UPN . <p> A final rating for " Nothing Human " would be around 2.2 to 2.6 , which would not be that good ! <p> Pickhard and Cue !

The article looks at the utter finality of this ending , compared to the other Trek endings : <p> This time the drama is real , as production on the Emmy-winning series wrapped in late April and workers at Paramount studios began dismantling the elaborate sets once and for all . After seven years in first-run syndication , " Deep Space Nine " comes to a close with a two-hour special Saturday night on KCOP . And unlike its " Star Trek " siblings , which have spun off new series and films , no one expects there to be an afterlife for " Deep Space .

Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for pointing me to this . <p> More DS9 CutsChristian ( 3:20 pm CST ) It appears the cutting continues . Yesterday we already knew Chicago , Philadelphia and Austin would not be able to see the DS9 finale in one piece , but today I heard the same thing will happen in Boston . Boston 's WB56 will be showing Part One this Saturday at 8:00pm , while Part Two will be shown exactly one week later . Thanks go out to Jason Ellis , Thomas Offen and SJK for reporting this . <p> We 've seen the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Kira and Jake standing together in " The Visitor , " after Sisko 's death which turned out not to be death . Then , Jake could not reconcile his existence without his father ; now he has become a man . " What You Leave Behind " was full of such visual references to things we 've seen before - in some cases flashbacks via older footage , in some cases by echoing an incident or event which took place previously . This is a grand , satisfying conclusion to this greatest of Trek series ; J. Michael Straczynski can eat his heart out , because while there were indeed parallels with the Babylon 5 finale " Sleeping In Light , " DS9 did a much better job borrowing from Arthurian , Norse , and Christian mythology to create an ending with deep emotional resonance . <p> ' Equinox ' Final RatingsChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) Michael Iversen at the Star Trek Universe has published the final ratings for ' Equinox , ' the Voyager season finale . Unfortunately , the news is not good , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in , and Voyager got a very disappointing 3.2/5 , and was nr. 78 on the primetime list . Voyager was down 0.1 from last week 's episode , and was of course 6th for the hour behind Charmed that got a 4.0 . <p> Voyager was also UPNs highest rated show . Other UPN shows was , 7 Days with a 2.1 , Moesha with a 2.0 , Malcolm &amp; Eddie with a 1.9 , Clueless with a 1.8 and Dilbert with a 1.7 . <p> Shatner Chat TonightChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) At 06:30pm Pacific Time , William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) will be attending a live chat at the official Star Trek Continuum . He 'll mostly be speaking about his new book ' Get A Life ! ' , though I 'm sure he 'll also answer questions about Star Trek in general and the new ' Free Enterprise ' movie . Info on how to participate can be found here , while advance questions can be submitted here . <p> Buffy " is where Shimerman has been spending most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about every fourth episode since he joined the series at the end of its first year . He auditioned for the role of Principal Flutie initially , but the job went to Ken Lerner , whose character met an untimely end late in the first season . The producers then called Shimerman to be the replacement . <p> Then came calls from David E. Kelley 's company . Would he like to do recurring guest shots as a judge on Kelley 's two Boston-based series , " Ally McBeal " and " The Practice " ? " I 've been on each show a couple of times , and I 've actually had to turn them down when they 've asked me to do more episodes , " he says . <p> In the full interview he talks a bit more about ' Buffy , ' but also about his lengthy involvement with Star Trek . <p> LeVar Burton Hands Out CertificateChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) According to an Associated Press article , LeVar Burton ( Geordi LaForge ) recently handed out a certificate of participation from the Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Platz , a seven-year old boy who wrote a book on farm machinery . <p> San Fransisco Chronicle DS9 ReviewChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) John Carman at the San Francisco Chronicle has written a review of the Deep Space Nine series finale , which will air in San Francisco tonight . The article is almost entirely filled with spoilers for ' What You Leave Behind , ' which is why I 'm not quoting it here . Carman is rather positive about Deep Space Nine , though , so if you 've already seen the final episode you still might want to read the full review . <p> ' Free Enterprise ' Cast SigningChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) For some strange reason , everyone seems to have completely forgotten about the new ' Free Enterprise ' film , but that does n't mean the distributor has stopped promoting it ! Today several members of the independent movie 's cast &amp; crew will be appearing at Golden Apple , Los Angeles ' number one comic store , according to the Free Enterprise site . Tomorrow the film ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 8 theatres near Los Angeles , while the rest of the country should hopefully follow soon . Find more in the official Free Enterprise schedule . <p> Berman Speaks Out On New SeriesChristian ( 3:19 pm CST ) For the third time in just two weeks time , Rick Berman has publicly stated there 'll soon be a fifth Star Trek series . This time , however , he also gave some extra info on when this new series might start . He did this in an interview with Dan Cray at the Los Angeles Times , who asked him about Trek 's future : <p> " We 're about to have a unique circumstance where there is going to be only one ' Star Trek ' show on the air " Star Trek : Voyager " for the first time in many years , but I do n't think that will be the case for long , " says Berman , who helped create and serves as an executive producer of " Voyager . " <p> Berman also anticipates that " Voyager " will follow the same course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deep Space Nine , " in wrapping production after no more than seven seasons ( the show is winding up its fifth season ) . <p> Though Berman would n't elaborate on the potential premise of the new series , he says " it 's a pretty good bet " that the next " Trek " will be ready to hit the air by September 2002 , though it could be fast-tracked to be on the air as soon as September 2000 . He would not speculate whether it would air on UPN or in syndication , saying he will be satisfied either way . <p> " I 'm sure whatever we do next will be different , because we want the ability to do something that challenges us , and that takes change , " Berman says . " Whatever the next television series , we hope it 's dramatically different but still embodies all the visions of " Star Trek " creator Gene Roddenberry 's idea of the future . " <p> I 'd say Series V will probably start right after Voyager ends , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's great to hear Rick Berman will apparently still be strongly involved with the new series - I doubt anyone else would have been able to do the job as well as Berman . Find more in the full article . <p> Okay , boys and girls . This time it 's for real . Star Trek Gaming Central has moved ! Hope you enjoyed your beam-over , by the way . There will be a fancy new domain name , but for the time being , all we get is a little IP address . But I am assured that the fancy new domain name will eventually happen . <p> This new site will be the same as it is now , for the time being . It will be subject to tweakings and what not over the next month or two . I plan for the site to ( eventually ) be 800x600 compliant , so there will be extra room for y'all to read the good stuff . There will also be other enhancements over the next month or so . There will be banners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site . <p> To kick of the new site , the official Starfleet Command Writing Contest has been opened , which has been organised together with Interplay .

Find more info at the new location of Star Trek Gaming Central . <p> ' Equinox ' Video ClipsChristian ( 3:19 pm CST ) The SCIFI Headquarters site has put up three ' Equinox ' video clips showing the full last 15 minutes of the Voyager season finale . Apparently videos were captured using a new technique in order to keep the file size down while keeping fairly good quality playback , so you should be able to get a fairly good impression of what happened in the episode . I 'm not sure if this is really legal , but if that does n't bother you , you can find the clips by going here . <p> ET ' Free Enterprise ' ArticlesChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) Entertainment Tonight Online has put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming independent movie starring William Shatner as , erm , William Shatner . The first article is an interview with Shatner himself , in which he talks about meeting rap stars for the film : <p> ET : Your William Shatner character has a totally different musical act . Where did that come from ? <p> William : I was listening to a station playing some rap music when I was driving and I thought , " That 's the way to do " Friends , Romans , Countrymen ... " from " Julius Caesar . " So I suggested a rap version . And I went down to a dark , dimly lit studio and I met the most charming group of talented rap artists , RATED R. We laid down some tracks and another night we came back and laid down some more tracks . The guy who mixed it was superb . The whole thing is so way-out . It 's so pushing the envelope of something I 've ever done that it 's kind of fun . <p> More on this can be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also available - it even includes a short preview of the movie ! <p> Beam Nokia UpChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) Sandy McMurray of the Toronto Sun has written a review of the Nokia 9000i Communicator , a new cell phone / fax / computer from Nokia . He reviews the Communicator by comparing it to its well-known Star Trek sibling , so you might want to check out his review . <p> DS9 Finale CutsChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) After yesterday 's news submission by J.R . Cortez about the DS9 finale being broken up in two parts in Austin next Saturday , many people wrote in to say that this would be happening in their cities as well . So far , I know of three cities where ' What You Leave Behind ' will not be shown as one two-hour episode : <p> -In Austin , KTBC Channel 2 will be breaking up " What You Leave Behind " into two parts this coming Sat . night , first at 9:00 p.m. then part two at 11:35 p.m . Thanks go out to J.R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 will apparently be showing one hour of the DS9 finale tonight at 10:00pm , right after Voyager , as they always do . There is no mention of when the second hour is going to be shown , though that might possibly be on Sunday , the 6th . Thanks go out to Holly Kim Wilson for this . <p> -News gets even worse in Chicago , where WGN Channel 9 will be showing part one at 4:00pm on Saturday , June 5th , and part two the Saturday after , also at 4:00pm . This is especially alarming because writer Ira Steven Behr recently mentioned the finale would be cut up in two parts for syndication in any case , and that this would result in the removal of six minutes of footage - hopefully Chicago will still get the full version . Thanks go out to ( deep breath ) John , Jamahl Epsicokhan , Scott Dreyer , Bob Nicholas , Barb Hannan , Dan Rohowsky and J.Buras for reporting this . <p> If anyone else has more news on this , please let me know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in Chicago now , though : - ) . <p> DS9 Writers Say GoodbyeChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) A new article has appeared at the Continuum , in which the writers of Deep Space Nine say goodbye to the series they 've been creating for the past seven years . In the interview , people such as Ira Steven Behr , Ron Moore and Hans Beimler talk about the tight writer group , the story arcs , the battles with the studio and the preparations for the final season . The article ends by mentioning what the writers will be doing next : <p> The end of ST:DS9 brings a game of musical chairs for writers as well as actors . Thompson , Weddle , Echevarria and Beimler are all off pursuing other projects and jobs . Ron Moore has gone over to Star Trek : Voyager as Co-Executive Producer with Brannon Braga . Behr jokes that he will go on the road as an opening act for James Darren Vic Fontaine , but has a development deal that will keep him at Paramount for at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm looking forward to truly relaxing for the first time in seven years , " says Behr . " I 'll miss the process . I 'll have other processes in my career , but I 'm sure going to miss this one . And I 'm sure going to miss those lunches . " <p> ...... I have no idea where to start ...... its 02:35 in the night in Denmark right now , and for the past 10 min I have staired into my computer monitor ...... this episode was a ..... very moving episode . There was a special scene in this episode , that was so moving that you can not understand it before you see it . <p> ...... 7 min has now gone since I started writing this , and I still have n't got a clue where to start . ............. Earlier today I was in a very famous amusement park called Tivoli , its in central Copenhagen . They have gotten a new ride , where you get into a seat , the seat then goes 60 meters up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ...... when I got out of that ride , then I had no idea how to describe it , I have the same feeling after I have watched " What You Leave Behind " Its 1+ hour of free fall , and when you finally land , you have no idea what just hapenned , besides that it was an experience that you will remember for a very long time . <p> Ordover ReturnsChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) After a system error at Pocket Books caused John Ordover 's Q&amp;A board to be down for more than a week , they were finally able to get the editor 's Q&amp;A board up and running again . Take a look at two of the most interesting questions ( and Ordover 's responses ) : <p> Query from : Jim McCain 1 . What is the status of Tales of the Federation short stories ? 2 . About a year ago something was mentioned about a George Kirk / Robert April novel . Anything to report on this ? 3 . What about the 2 Pike novels that were mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordover They were never short stories , TOF was a group title for books that do n't focus on the regulars , which we did n't wind up using because , as you see , it made people think it was a book of short stories . Nothing new on the Pike stuff at the moment . <p> Query from : Andy ( new ) another lost question ! Thanks , I 'll be patient as you catch up . I understand that using song lyrics is not a good idea since the material is not original . I wrote a song for Vic Fontaine to sing to Janeway . ( I can pull it off . ) It is more like dialogue than song . Will this be permissable ? please say yes , you wo n't regret it . <p> Response from : John Ordover Sigh , I answered this twice and it was lost both times . I very much appreciate your patience on this . It is fine to write a new song for Vic , but since Vic 's program was n't written until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first shows up , Bashir explains he 's something new ) I do n't see how you can make sense of him showing up on Voyager . <p> Lots more can be found at the Q&amp;A board , assuming a system error did n't wipe it out again : - ) . <p> Lynch Reviews ' The Dogs Of War'Christian ( 3:16 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi just put up Tim Lynch 's review of ' The Dogs Of War , ' DS9 's last Ferengi episode ever . Considering Lynch 's general dislike of Ferengi episodes , it is not surprising to learn that he was n't that impressed with this episode , either : <p> Even if I had n't already known that DS9 was coming to a close soon , the last few weeks would have made it pretty obvious . First Damar leads a rebellion against the Dominion , then Martok rises to the Chancellorship in the Klingon Empire , and now there 's a power shift on Ferenginar . It 's perhaps a little convenient that all of this is happening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ending of late . <p> I do have to regret spending nearly half an episode right before the series finale wrapping up as unappealing a set of characters as Zek , Brunt , Ishka and the like , however . Given that they 've been characters of long standing ( Zek , after all , has been around since DS9 's first season ) , it certainly makes sense to visit them here--at least , more than it did heading back to DaiMon Bok in TNG 's final few episodes . However , with Ishka 's last appearance in the terrible " Profit and Lace " and Zek 's in the only marginally better " The Emperor 's New Cloak " , I ca n't say these are characters I 'm particularly interested in seeing again . ( This is probably coming as a surprise to absolutely no one so far , considering my previous statements about heavy-Ferengi shows . ) <p> Shatner Chat TonightChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) Tomorrow William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) will be chatting at the official Continuum , but today already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series ' captain . The chat will take place at 8:00pm Eastern Time , and info about the chat can already be found here . Thanks go out to the William Shatner Connection for this info . <p> Continuum Finale Screening ReportChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) The Continuum has a new article available reporting about the two screenings of the DS9 finale , which took place on Thursday and Friday at the Los Angeles Museum of Television and Radio . According to the article , the finale was very well received by the audience : <p> On Thursday , May 27 , enthusiastic fans - even a few in Starfleet uniform - packed the Museum 's John H. Mitchell Theater in Beverly Hills . Ira Steven Behr , the series ' executive producer , greeted the crowd and filled them in on what was to come . The penultimate episode would not air in Los Angeles until two days later , so several details from that installment had to be revealed for the finale to make sense . The lights dimmed and the two-hour finale unfolded . The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - all in the right places . When the end credits rolled and the music swelled , a standing ovation was in order for all that had been resolved after 175 episodes . <p> The rest of the article contains a report of the Q&amp;A sessions which took place after the screenings . If you 'd like to read more about these screenings , here at TrekToday we still have the Thursday screening report from Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga and the Friday screening report from Scotto available - I strongly recommend you check those out ! <p> Brooks Examines Deep Space NineChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) Tying in with the Deep Space Nine series finale , Los Angeles Times writer Dan Cray has conducted an interview with Avery Brooks , who starred on DS9 as Captain Benjamin Sisko . In the interview , Brooks philosophizes about his ' pivotal role on the series : ' <p> He says he has enjoyed the opportunity to " give brown children--though not exclusively--a chance to think in the long thought " but feels that any long-term importance placed on his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV viewers themselves . <p> " There 's no substitute for the exchange between human beings , " Brooks says . " I 'm playing to the people that are out there , and I hope the camera reaches in and finds whatever truth is in there . Fortunately we human beings complete the thought . . . . That 's the power of ' Star Trek , ' it rests with the viewer . I participate , but ultimately the completion of the thought lies with every single human being .

Christian ( 3:13 pm CST ) Is there anyone else who is already extremely excited about the recently announced new Trek series Berman is apparently developing ? I know it 'll still be a few years before it actually makes it to the air , but what I 'm really excited about is the months of anticipation leading up to the premiere - that 's precisely what makes running a site such as TrekToday so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to appear ! <p> Tuesday June 1 , 1999 <p> Friday Finale Screening ReportChristian ( 3:35 pm CST ) A few days ago , we were already able to put up a report and review of Thursday 's screening of the DS9 finale , thanks to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga . Now I 'm very happy to also present you a report of Friday 's screening , which was attended by Scotto . Scotto was kind enough to send in a report of the screening event : <p> The Museum had a second screening the two-hour finale of this science fiction series . This was a follow up to the premier that was held the night before . Many of the recurring guest cast were present and answered questions before the screening . It was a very casual atmosphere , and everyone in attendance had a great time . <p> I will not go into a review since Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga already did a great job . But the following is a list of who was there and a little of what was said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , and just after Ira filled in the L.A audience of the plot lines in " Dogs of War " that had not aired yet in L.A. <p> DS9 Finale Broken Up ! Christian ( 3:34 pm CST ) J.R . Cortez just send in some sad news - apparently in some cities , the DS9 finale wo n't be shown as one two-hour movie , but will instead be broken up in two parts : <p> According to the Austin American-Statesman , our local Fox affiliate KTBC Channel 2 , will be breaking up " What You Leave Behind " into two parts this coming Sat . night , first at 9:00 p.m. then part two at 11:35 p.m. ( probably so as not to run past news time at 10 ) . They probably also do n't want to break up COPS and America 's Most Wanted . <p> At least this station will still be showing the finale on one day - does anyone know if there are also stations that will be showing the finale over the course of two weeks ? <p> George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Antonio Express-News has put up an interview with George Takei ( Hikaru Sulu ) , written by David Martindale . In the interview , Takei tells us that , unlike what Star Trek usually display , he does n't really like technology - he thinks it makes human contacts much more impersonal . This does n't make Takei distance himself from the franchise , however , as the rest of the article is mostly filled with what Takei does best : campaigning for a ' Captain Sulu ' series and attacking William Shatner : <p> " Simon &amp; Schuster picked up the cue on the Sulu character and launched ' The Adventures of Captain Sulu ' on audiocassette and they 've been quite successful . So I 'm trying to parlay that success into a TV series . I think it could be the definitive and most popular ' Star Trek ' of them all . It 's not just the adventures of this heroic , swashbuckling captain , but now we discover he 's got a daughter . There 's a whole romantic side . And we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to interpret that remark as a slam against William Shatner , who starred as Capt . James T. Kirk , go ahead . After all , Takei rarely misses a chance to get in a shot . " Let 's just say he is a pompous and pampered and extremely self-centered individual . " <p> In the rest of the interview , Takei talks more about about his ' Captain Sulu ' dream , but also looks at the Trek phenomenon as a whole . <p> Born in the shadow of " Star Trek : The Next Generation " and obscured by the flashy launch of UPN and its flagship series " Star Trek : Voyager , " the syndicated " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " has always been the Jan Brady of " Trek " shows - caught in the middle and largely ignored . <p> ... <p> It 's a shame . If any " Trek " deserves media attention and a larger audience , this is the show . This week it will be over ( check local listings for airdate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know a quantum singularity from a warp core breach , " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " was the most accessible " Trek " because it dealt more with characters than sci-fi gobbledygook terminology . <p> Owen then proceeds to give us nine reasons ' Deep Space Nine ' is the best Trek yet . Go check it out ! <p> There 's a moment in " The Dogs of War " when Quark has had enough . He has watched as Ferengi society around him has become , in his view , a travesty . And he realizes he has n't been immune from the changes over the years ; he sees that he has gone " soft . " He launches into a histrionic tirade that continues to build in amusement as Quark 's disgust is unleashed . Then he yells : " The line has to be drawn here ! This far , and no further ! " <p> I could n't stop laughing . <p> It perhaps helps to know that the line was lifted almost directly from the speech Picard made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably had it in mind when he co-wrote " Dogs of War . " It 's refreshing to see an inside joke taken to such a blatantly over-the-top , self-referential , take-us-none-seriously extreme . But despite the fact the jokes are n't meant to be taken seriously , there 's something about the character undercurrent that can be . Quark 's story--undoubtedly DS9 's last visit to Ferengi society--is without a doubt comedy , but behind it is a bizarre ring of truth . <p> The full review awards the episode 3 out of 4 stars , which is certainly not bed for an episode which was strongly intended as set-up for the finale . <p> DS9 Actor ChatsChristian ( 3:31 pm CST ) Today TV Guide Online will be hosting live chats with not one , but two Star Trek actors ! At 8:00pm Eastern Time , Nana Visitor will be chatting , followed two hours later by Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) . Extra information on the chat can be found here at Yahoo , which is also where the chat itself will take place . <p> Publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocket Books editor Marco Palmieri posted a new Editor 's Log detailing the future of the Star Trek novels line , and then especially the DS9 novels . As I was rather curious how the comics people at WildStorm would be handling this , I sent off a mail to editor Jeff Mariotte about precisely this . Take a look at what he had to say : <p> We 'll be working closely with Marco Palmieri , John Ordover , and Margaret Clark at Pocket Books , as well as our contacts at Paramount , to dovetail our approach to DS9 with theirs . For the most part , we wo n't be doing stories set in the past of DS9 ( unless there 's a very very good reason to do so ) but stories that extend the story into the future . <p> I 'm very close to releasing the names of some creative teams . We have some writers definitely signed and working on their scripts , and we have some cool artists awaiting approval . As soon as we have a few artists approved I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects they 're working on . I can say at this point that the writers who have been signed are all novelists , though most of them have also done comics work as well , and they all have some connection to the world of comics . More news soon . <p> Cinescape Spoils DS9 FinaleChristian ( 3:30 pm CST ) For what is the last time ever , regular Cinescape contributor Michael Marek has provided the sci-fi news site with a detailed synopsis of ' What You Leave Behind , ' the final DS9 episode . Of course , his synopsis is packed with spoilers , so you probably do not want to read it . Believe me , some major things will be happening in the DS9 finale , and it is rather likely your enjoyment will be lessened if you read these spoilers . If you really want to hear all about what is going to happen , you can find the full report at Cinescape . <p> Visitor Wants To Do ComedyChristian ( 3:30 pm CST ) Michael Peck at TV Guide has put up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Colonel Kira Nerys on Deep Space Nine . In the interview , Visitor provides some info on what she would like to do next : <p> " I 'd like to do some comedy ... If it 's stage , television or whatever , I 'd just like to do something a little lighter now . It was heavy subject matter for sure ... I was carried along by this wave of Star Trek , so now I 'm manning the ship again . " <p> In the interview , Visitor talks about visiting fan sites dedicated to her ( she does n't ) and being recognized in public ( she is n't ) . Thanks go out to AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz for pointing me to this . <p> Mania Looks At Voyager 's FutureChristian ( 3:29 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green at AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine has just written a feature article looking at the future of ' Star Trek : Voyager , ' now the only new Trek series on the air . As everyone who regularly reads Green 's reviews knows , she often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to Deep Space Nine , as she also says in her article : <p> Looking back over my own reviews of Star Trek Voyager this year , I am surprised at how wildly uneven they are . I really liked a few episodes , I thought a few others showed great potential . But too great a number were self-contradictory or just plain ludicrous , and in the end , I still find myself watching the same lost-in-space series . <p> My overall impression of this season is that it was vastly better than the previous one ... but compared to the fifth seasons of The Next Generation , Babylon 5 , and especially Deep Space Nine , it 's still pretty poor . This year brought more balance in terms of getting to see characters other than Seven of Nine save the ship , but we 're still watching too many episodes about the need to save the ship - some of which have rather disturbing endings . <p> Green then goes on to analyze how each of the characters have been used over the past season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used too erratic to really make the series enjoyable . Even worse , she ends up by saying that the series might be beyond rescue : <p> Scariest of all , I do n't see how this series can be saved . Certainly not by returning this crew to the Alpha Quadrant , as is most often suggested , since I will find it absolutely laughable if any of the crew choose to stay on the ship after finally getting home ! The prospect of a contrived Maquis trial , of the crew re-enlisting out of personal loyalty , of these people wanting to stick together in the wake of their ordeal and the Dominion War is just not exciting . And really , I do n't want Seven of Nine mucking up the Alpha Quadrant for potential future forays by the Enterprise and Defiant crews . <p> In the full review , Green gives us her full analysis of the show , and also offers a possible way to save the show . <p> -At 17:00 and at 23:30 BST tomorrow , British Sky One will be showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 18:00 BST tomorrow , BBC Two will be showing TNG 's ' Rascals , ' followed 45 minutes later by ' A Fistful Of Datas .

Fortunately the UK ratings news is a lot better than the usual gloomy reports from the US : <p> The news is generally good this week . On BBC2 , TNG did n't budge from its comfortable ninth place ranking . However , there was a bit of a drop in audience figures , from 3m to 2.79m . DS9 was n't showing , so it had a week off from its miserable ratings ! <p> Over on Sky 1 , however , the news was all good - Voyager 's fifth season refused to let some top-rated programs like ER , The X-Files and The Simpsons past it - " In the Flesh " took a magnificent silver at #2 in the Sky charts ( only below Sky 's flagship , Friends ) , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only four episodes ! ) . If only the BBC could learn from Sky ... <p> In correction to the list of cast showing up for the Friday screening , I was there and James Darren - Vic Fontaine did not show up . He was at a photo shoot for his new CD based on the songs he did on DS9 according to Ira Steven Behr . Also the actress that played the female Founder Salome Jenis was there and was part of the panel that answered questions from the audience before the screening . <p> It 's certainly interesting to hear we 'll soon be able to buy a Vic Fontaine CD - I do n't think I 've heard about that before . Major thanks go out to Scotto for reporting this . <p> TV Guide Canada DS9 IssueChristian ( 3:23 pm CST ) Gustavo Leao just sent in the news that the TV Guide Canada web site has also posted a short preview of their Deep Space Nine feature . On the site , DS9 receives a short mention in their ' Season Finales - R.I.P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS9 was touted as the first " gritty " Star Trek , a spin-off calculated to set Gene Roddenberry spinning in his grave . <p> The series delivered on the darkness , but it was the the strong storylines and character development ( the LONG ... political stew , Sisko 's enigmatic role as The Emissary , Gul Dukat 's flips from ally to enemy to insanity ) which kept the fans coming back . <p> Weekend On The Promenade ReportChristian ( 3:22 pm CST ) Melissa at Sid City , the Alexander Siddig fan site , has finally put up her report of the ' Weekend on the Promenade ' convention , which took place several weeks ago . The convention was n't just attended by ' Sid , ' but also by people such as Andrew Robinson ( Garak ) , who told a bit about his upcoming book : <p> I also got to meet Andy and tell him how impressed I was with his Garak 's Diaries . He read a bit to us on Saturday night and claimed it was a first draft . Sheesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be thrilled ! I 'm lobbying for him to do a book signing at my bookstore in Kansas this fall ... fingers crossed ! Andy was quite charming , and teased me mercilessly about my " Wizard of Oz accent . " It did n't help that the dress I was wearing reminded him of Dorothy 's dress in the movie . <p> The full report contains a detailed description of the events at the convention , plus several photos which were taken by some of the conventiongoers . <p> I just noticed the Continuum has put up its official preview of ' What You Leave Behind .

Unfortunately some of the regular features seem slightly trimmed down this month ( especially the news and review sections ) , but the journal is still well worth reading for its excellent columns . The new issue can be found by clicking here . <p> The first temptation in any review is to say what the episode reminded me of . " Warhead " reminded me of Crimson Tide , the Gene Hackman/Denzel Washington submarine thriller ; Wargames , with a very young Matthew Broderick and Dabney Coleman ; and Terminator 2 . I enjoyed those films , so the reminder was welcome . <p> I have heard complaints about this episode being slow and boring , but I thought it nicely suspenseful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thrilling , but knowing what happens when there 's no more fuse adds the necessary suspense . <p> In the end , these similarities lead Wright to award to award the episode 3.5 out of 4 stars , as you can read in his full review . <p> Official DS9 Finale Timing SheetChristian ( 3:20 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has put up the official timing sheet for ' What You Leave Behind , ' the Deep Space Nine series finale .

Thanks go out to diGGdoug at the TrekWeb Message Boards for alerting me to this . <p> Do n't get me wrong ; Birth of the Federation IS actually somewhat enjoyable . I find myself playing the game for hours on end . But when I look back and see what I 've accomplished over that time , and I see that really nothing has really changed , I start to wonder how else I could have spent my day .

The first review , written by Lee Whiteside , is rather positive about ' What You Leave Behind : ' <p> Overall , I think it comes off well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue on in some fashion down the road . There 's definitely some similarity to the way Babylon 5 ended , but almost any show in that type of setting would have similar things happen . <p> There 's a good amount of humor in it as well , which lightens the mood when it needs it in most cases . If you 've been watching the show for 7 years and feel you know these characters , you 'll more than likely need a tissue in a few spots . <p> You can find Lee 's full review here . The other review , written by webmaster the KJB of the great Backstage Pass site is slightly less positive , though it still calls it one of the best finales of the season . You can find that review here . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for pointing me to this . <p> Rick Berman On Trek 's FutureChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) Jefferson Graham at the USA Today has written an article looking at the ' final Trek of DS9 , ' which has Rick Berman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts by saying that he thinks it will be very beneficial for Voyager to be the only Trek show on the air , and that he feels it 's very important ' to keep Star Trek fresh and not overextend it . ' After that , he actually gives some info on Star Trek 's future : <p> Paramount has no plans to spin the DS9 characters off into a feature film . " Saturating the market with another franchise of movies might not be wise at the moment , " says Berman , who says there wo n't be another Trek film before 2001 . <p> Voyager is still thriving on UPN and remains the network 's highest-rated show . Star Kate Mulgrew made noise last summer that she might leave the show , but Berman says she has a contract for the sixth season , which starts production this summer , " and she 'll be back . " And the year after ? " That is a negotiation that always takes place with actors , and we 'll see . " <p> ... <p> But for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be a long gap between the end of DS9 and a new Trek series . " I do n't expect the hiatus to be more than a year , " Berman says . <p> Apparently this interview was done a few weeks ago , as Kate Mulgrew has since announced she 's signed on for the seventh season . It 's also great to hear Berman talk about a new Trek series - let 's hope we 'll soon get to hear more about a possible new series . <p> Unfortunately , I just received some information from the great Lord Spock which would seem to suggest that this might not actually be the case . In order not to start any rumours yet , I 've decided not to post his report yet and first get some more information - hopefully you 'll be able to read more in tomorrow 's update ! ( How 's that for a cliffhanger ? ? ; - ) <p> A Sequel For ' Trekkies ?

The transcript contains the interesting news that there might be a sequel to the film : <p> Jonathan Leigh asks : Where there some people who were just too extreme to be put in the movie ? <p> Well , certainly someone who is mad enough to run a daily Trek news site *and* who lives in the Netherlands should be able to qualify , right ; - ) ? Seriously , later on they mention a sequel again , so we might actually be seeing a ' Trekkies II . ' Read more in the full transcript . <p> Why Voyager Is n't Home YetChristian ( 3:14 pm CST ) Lord Spock just sent me an interesting tidbit about the reason for Voyager not being home yet . As you may have heard , it has been rumoured that the Voyager writers wanted the ship to get home , but Paramount would n't allow it . According to Lord Spock , however , the real story may be slightly different : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost the ratings and attract DS9 fans . However it was to late because they were already developing the Season Finale , so Paramount said they 'd wait till season six . <p> Major thanks go out to Lord Spock for this info ! <p> Trek Toy NewsChristian ( 3:14 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac just updated his site again , providing us with some all-new Trek action figure news . First up is the news that the rather cool Kirk figure from ' A Piece Of The Action ' is now available via ToyFare : <p> After being delayed a week , due to it 's Star Wars Episode I content , ToyFare #23 hit the stands on May 19 . This issue contains the coupon for the ToyFare Exclusive Captain Kirk from " A Piece of the Action . " Kirk is $2 more than previous ToyFare exclusives at $12 , and is supposedly limited to less than 8,500 pieces , yet each coupon entitles you to order an unlimited amount . <p> Other news includes the fact that Target has now apparently lowered the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news that Playmates have put up a photo of the upcoming Target Exclusive 9 " Nurse Chapel figure . Find all the other news at the Toy Maniac 's news page . <p> Ok TrekWeb fans , here are some of the first responses from various screenings of Deep Space Nine 's " What You Leave Behind " . The Spoiler-free reviews are at the top . One person posted a complete synop of what she saw , and there is spoiler space for that . So you are safe to read it up till the spoiler spaces . Special thanks to OdoGodess , DSic36141 , and STFC Wah for posting these on AOL boards . <p> OdoGodess especially provides an interesting review , as it contains the most detailed synopsis of the episode to appear on the net yet . The review of ' Dsic36141 ' is slightly less interesting , as it only seems to consist of ' &lt;&gt; ' for some really weird reason .

Click here to avoid being spoiled . <p> Again , this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new season . <p> Today I received some rather interesting new info from Paramount insider Lord Spock : <p> The first episode for next season on Voyager has been written . Of course it is the exciting conclusion to last season 's ' Equinox . ' There are a lot of major changes that will take place including the death of a certain EMH that has been around for 5 seasons . But do n't worry there is going to be a new EMH in town - he 'll be bald , funny and missing a certain oath . <p> The second episode is being written as we speak and deals with Voyager being taken apart . <p> Season six starts filming on June 21 . All the cast will be back ! <p> As for the crew getting home , the buzz is that it will probably happen right before christmas . Voyager may also have a Holiday cliff-hanger . That means the first part will air in mid-December and concluded in mid-January 2000 ! ! ! <p> Thanks go out to Lord Spock for the above info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following info from an anonymous source : <p> There was an unofficial report stating that the crew of the Equinox was a rebellious crew that the Federation has been looking for until they disappeared . They will try to introduce this in part 2 . <p> Keep in mind that none of the above should be taken as fact - lots of things are still bound to change , and you really should n't consider these news items as anything more than unconfirmed rumours . <p> Massive Trek Games PreviewChristian ( 3:08 pm CST ) GamesMania has put up a new ' TrekMania ' feature , looking at the 7 Star Trek games which were shown at the E3 conference . GamesMania was pretty impressed with all the games currently in development : <p> We saw a total of seven titles between the three companies , and what 's very encouraging is that unlike previous years , there are no obvious duds . Whereas in the past we 've had to deal with games saturated with FMV instead of gameplay , all titles have the potential . Whether they deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until review time to determine , but it 's more than fair to say that there was a positive consistency in all the games we saw . I ca n't remember the last time this happened with the Trek computer game franchise . <p> Their feature also includes a preview of the Collective 's great-looking ' DS9 - The Fallen ' game , which will apparently include no less than 30 different environments : <p> The game takes place in 30 different environments , 25% of which are " referenced from the show , " according to Hare . However , they will also be including new , previously unseen environments , including material built from the DS9 technical manual that is too cost prohibitive for Paramount to incorporate into the show . We 'll also get to see environments such as a Bajoran ship , a Bajoran monastery , a Jem'Hadar internment camp , and various planet-side environments . We 'll get to explore " an almost entirely faithful 100% version of the Defiant . " Hare says that they did n't want the entire game claustrophobically bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When It Rains ... " though down from last week still performed well , earning a 4.3 rating and holding on to the 12th place position . That mark puts the episode right around the season average and shockingly has earned DS9 one of its first season-to-season increases in its history . " When It Rains ... " outperformed last year 's " Profit and Lace , " which only managed a 4.2 . <p> DS9 , as has become the norm , held the #1 syndicated drama position for another week handily defeating both Xena and Hercules . Xena was half a point down in second and Hercules again failed to make the top 20 . <p> Although this episode is down from last week , it 's still a strong showing for DS9 . Rarely has the show been able to maintain its season average throughought the year , but it looks like Season 7 will accomplish that . In addition , this May sweeps period is currently tied with last season -- a major step up as far as season-to-season stability goes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Saw the film TREKKIES , last Wednesday night in Pittsburgh . Have to say that I felt pretty bad if they were any die-hard Trekkies in the theater because we laughed our asses off the entire film . TREKKIES looks into the lives of people off in their on little world .. or off in space at least . <p> The film was put together fairly well . Annoying as hell for the first thirty minutes or so because it looked as if it was shot in 16mm and converted to 35mm MEANING At times peoples heads were chopped off as they talked . Most of the people at the screenings ( students , filmmakers lawyers , yadda , yadda ) agree that it 's going to be a cult classic for repeated party viewer . <p> Insurrection Rental At No. 5 ?

As you may recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Video Software Dealers Association top 10 , but on the Billboard top 10 it is no higher than the 5th place . <p> Just a reminder .

Or it can be accessed by IRC at Server chat.hosting4u.net on channel #trekgaming . Jeff Holzhauer ( Producer of BotF ) has told me he will be there to chat with everyone . So it should make things interesting . I hope to see you all there . <p> Hopefully this time Holzhauer *will* actually show up , unlike the last time he was supposed to be making an appearance at the chat session . Still , even if he does n't arrive , you 'll be able to talk all about the new Trek game in the chat room tonight . <p> MYSTERY OF THE WEEK : Who decided that " closure " for the " Ferengi situation " was necessary ?

Even last week 's " Extreme Measures , " while seriously botched , was dealing with something worthwhile .

Does anyone care what Rom 's fate will be , or who will replace Zek as Grand Dingus ?

His review is mixed at best : <p> If a long , complicated journey into Star Trek minutiae sounds like your idea of a perfect weekend , Birth of the Federation is certainly worth the time investment required to play it . That said , this is a very deep strategic game , and too abstract and complicated to appeal to the casual gamer . <p> In the full review , Carlson ends by saying that ' only Trekkies need apply , ' though he does award the game a respectable 84% .

Admitting to interviewer Chase Masterson that he had talked quite enough about the impending end of Enterprise , he spoke at length instead about his theatrical background and other interests . <p> " I 'm still a little ass-backward on my sleep , " he admitted , slightly hoarse from previous interviews , saying that he would n't have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and New Zealand before taking off later in the week for London , where he was planning " a whirlwind day " of sightseeing before attending a convention .

" His brother was the science fiction and D&amp;D fan , while Trinneer was more interested in athletics and had no experience whatsoever with performing apart from having been in an arena playing football .

Though I saw the tape three times , the individual cuts went by rather quickly . <p> I can remember the following cuts as an announcer explains the films premise : Allen sitting in a captains chair ( obviously modeled on a Star Trek bridge set ) , looking appropriately smug and pompous while grunting to himself . ...

Also do n't forget to check out the official Galaxy Quest site , which is a hilarious parody on many Star Trek homepages out there . <p> ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil ' InterviewChristian ( 6:18 pm CST ) Over at the official Continuum , they 've put up an interview with Laird Malamed , Activision 's brand manager for their Star Trek games . In the interview , he mostly talks about their ' Star Trek : Hidden Evil ' game , which is currently scheduled for release on the 11th of November . One of the most interesting parts in the interview is where Malamed talks about the background of the game 's main character : <p> Malamed feels that the story of Star Trek : Hidden Evil is as strong as any great Star Trek : The Next Generation episode or film . In the game the character Sovok is a human who has been raised on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . " Sovok could never reach the Vulcan state of logic and so he turned to Starfleet . At the start of the game he is working on a space station that is in orbit around Ba'ku . We had a lot of fun writing the back story . " When asked whether or not the story is set in stone before the game is built Malamed laughed , " Yes , the story is set . We have to have a strong three act structure . Still that story is affected by the demands of the game design and the spontaneous discoveries that take place while we created the product . " <p> Voyager ' Riddles ' PromoChristian ( 6:17 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has uploaded the promo for next week 's new Voyager episode , ' Riddles ' . As is usual for UPN Voyager promos , the preview is incredibly bad , undoubtedly providing a very wrong look at the actual episode .

She will only be appearing at the ball itself , and not at the day activities . The full guest list can be found here .

Adding to the extensive Star Trek library , Paramount Home Video has just released four more episodes of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine .

Hertzler ArticleChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) The official Star Trek Continuum has put up an article about the two Deep Space Nine books which J.G. Hertzler ( General Martok ) will be writing for Pocket Books . Take a look at what Herztler himself has to say about the books : <p> " Every great character has secrets buried in the past , " says Hertzler in a press release . " Klingons , I have found , are no different . And the demons that haunt Martok are proving to be the blood and bone of a very unusual and , I hope , defining tale of this richly complex people .

Almost as miraculously , Jammer does n't seem to hate the episode as much as most of his fellow reviewers did : <p> I do n't have much interesting to say about our friend " Alice . " It 's the sort of middling plot-based story that just does n't demand a great deal of discussion . There are n't many themes that are sufficiently interesting to dissect ; there are no real insights or implications to ponder ; there are no real surprises ; and unlike the previous four episodes , I did n't get the sense that the characters were the important aspect of the story , because it 's the plot that 's piloting this ship . <p> " Alice " is , however , a competent , watchable hour-long exercise with a few interesting moments as well as some questionable ones . This sort of story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not quite engaging enough to be labeled a mystery . Not boring enough to be labeled a failure . " Alice " so much tempts me to offer up a non-reaction reaction . <p> Playstation Klingon Academy DeadChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) GameSpot has a report up announcing that Interplay has officially canned the Playstation version of their upcoming ' Klingon Academy ' game . The announcement contains the following rather amusing paragraph , making one wonder what kind of geniuses actually work at Interplay : <p> Interestingly enough , this is the second Interplay Star Trek title to have been given the ax . In March of 1998 , Interplay put its Starfleet Academy PlayStation project to rest , calling the PlayStation 's 2MB system memory insufficient . One month later , Interplay announced the development of Klingon Academy . <p> If the original version already could n't run on the Playstation , how could they ever hope to have the sequel be compatible ?

Take a look at how the official Continuum describes the film : <p> After defeating a Borg vessel , Janeway launches an ambitious plan to steal a piece of Borg technology that could get the U.S.S. Voyager home . When the Borg detect her plan , they swiftly access Seven of Nine 's neural transceiver and make her an " offer " she ca n't refuse -- rejoin the Borg collective or the U.S.S. Voyager and it 's crew will be assimilated . Janeway must confront the Borg in their own vessel in order to rescue Seven , risking a possibly devastating confrontation with the Borg Queen ! <p> Thanks go out to the Continuum for both the description and the image , which is of course copyrighted by Paramount Pictures . <p> -On Thursday in the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Return of the Archons ' . <p> -On Thursday in the United Kingdom , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Equilibrium ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , while BBC Two will be showing TNG 's ' Descent , Part Two ' at 18:00 BST .

Christian ( 6:14 pm CST ) As I do n't have anything insightful to write today myself , I figured I 'd use this space to try to help two TrekToday readers who recently each asked me a Trek question which I unfortunately could n't answer . If you are able to help these people , please send me an email at christian@trektoday.com and I 'll forward your responses . <p> First off , George Czender recently received a Star Trek 3D Chess Set , but did n't receive any detailed instructions with it .

However , how many people actually know what he created ?

The producers wanted to have Voyager searching for deuterium because , I suppose , it fuels the ship and the consequences of the ship running out of " gas " seemed clearer to them ( and led to some funnier dialog ) than losing its last dilithium crystal . I pointed out more than once that deuterium is abundant in interstellar space , and could readily be swept up by the ship 's Bussard collectors , but they wanted to stick with the idea of the ship desperately running out of fuel . I suppose one could argue that there are regions of space devoid of deuterium , but that was n't my first choice .

In the article , she talks about meeting a fan of hers who had never seen her as Seven , the film itself , and , of course , Star Trek fans : <p> " They are somewhat passionate , " Ryan says winkingly of her fans . " But , my God , you have to love them . You have to love Star Trek fans because there is no more loyal or more passionate group of fans anywhere . They 'll go to the ends of earth for you .

In an episode slated to begin production November 4th , the Voyager crew run into " The Collective " , a set of Borgified children that have been separated from the collective ( notice that separation seems to be recurring theme for Voyager ? ) . Determined to rejoin the Collective at any cost , these little demon seeds hold the Voyager crew hostage until things turn really ugly . Unbeknownst to the would be Borg babies , they 're " flawed " and the Collective would rather destroy them than let them interface . Look for a lot of 7 of 9 angst scenes as some of the Borg children start to question returning to the collective . <p> Buy A Trek ChequeChristian ( 5:37 pm CST ) The Anthony Grandio Company has just announced it will soon be launching a set of bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wizard of Oz ' , ' Xena ' , and , of course , ' Star Trek ' .

The most negative of the two is Jim , awarding the episode no more than 2.5 stars : <p> Not terrible by any means . I did n't hate it . I did n't loathe it . I did swear at it , and it did disappoint me , but mostly because it promised more than it delivered . With a little bit of reworking , this could have been a contender . As it is , this is a stumble from last week , and the weakest of the season . The good news is , if this is as bad as Voyager gets in season six , I wo n't mind a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Heather 's thoughts on the episode can be found here . <p> Trek Stars In ' Eye of the Beholder'Christian ( 6:19 pm CST ) Dark Horizons is reporting that Destination Films has just opened the official web site for their new movie Eye of the Beholder . The two female stars in the movie should be familiar to Trek fans - Ashley Judd appeared in two episodes of TNG as Ensign Robin Lefler , while GeneviFve Bujold was originally cast as Kathryn Janeway until , one day after starting production on ' Caretaker ' , she decided she did n't want to do series television after all .

One of the shots gives us the first close-up look at Picard and Data , who , to put it mildly , do n't look very impressive , but maybe I 've just been spoiled by the many ' DS9 : The Fallen ' and ' Voyager : Elite Force ' shots . In any case , you can find the screenshots here - thanks go out to Blue for the link . <p> A few weeks ago I made up my own Voyager Wishlist .

DeCandido and containing art by Pete Pachoumis and Lucian Rizzo . The reviewers seem pretty impressed : <p> I am a casual Star Trek viewer , but I 'm not the world 's biggest fan , so I was n't really that excited about the announcement of yet another shot at the Trek license . However , Wildstorm seems to be doing it right , grabbing writers and artists that non-Trek fans like me will be interested in . In this case , it 's writer ( and former editor of the Marvel line of novels ) Keith R.A. DeCandido , and he turns in a story every bit as good as the ones I 've read from him in other places . <p> Upcoming Trek Novel CoversChristian ( 6:17 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same four upcoming Trek novels for which he recently already provided the back cover text , namely the Captain 's Table omnibus , two DS9 : Millennium novels , and a trivia book . Especially interesting should be the cover of ' Millenium Book Two : The War of the Prophets ' , as it provides a first look at ( wait for it ... ) Kai Weyoun ! You can find the cover images via Psi Phi 's What 's New page . <p> ' Klingon Academy ' Development LogChristian ( 6:17 pm CST ) I noticed over on Klingon Academy News that Interplay have put up a special development page for their upcoming space simulation , ' Klingon Academy ' . On the page , the game 's developers provide an inside look at how things are progressing with the game , which is scheduled to go gold in just a few weeks . Take a look at a status report from Mark Murakami , programmer on the game : <p> Bugs , bugs , bugs . Most of our efforts lately have been in bug fixing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a valuable tool in helping us track down bugs . Some examples of daily bugs that we might encounter are : Minor code errors , minor logic errors or design flaws that come up from game testing , minor additions we feel need to be added to the game , etc . Its amazing how many little things come up during playtesting . <p> Aside from bug fixing , we have also been working a lot with the scriptors lately . We have been working together to get all of the mission details into the game and working . Also , we have started working on a lot of game optimizing . Sections of the 3D engine , 2D overlays , AI , and sound engine , have been much improved , and we plan to continuing to optimize the game even more . Music has been another recent addition . We have a great system that allows the scriptors to change music themes seamlessly during a mission . <p> ' Mark of Gideon ' ArticleChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) Over at the Trek Nation , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In it , he looks at a situation depicted in the Original Series episode ' The Mark of Gideon ' which Earth itself is facing right now - overpopulation : <p> In The Original Series third-season , which was n't as bad as some people said it was , the episode " The Mark of Gideon " is pretty much the only episode ever done within the Trek realm that concentrates on the problems of overpopulation . It is the only episode of Star Trek that makes us think of how humanity - or humanoids in this case - are hurting their planet , as well as hurting themselves , by overpopulation . It tells of the Gideons ' want for privacy , even if it only lasted for one second , and what extreme measures they will do to get it . One of the best episodes of any Star Trek ever that deals with a subject matter that can be applied today , despite being told nearly three-and-a-half decades ago . <p> Scarlett Pomers NewsChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) The official Scarlett Pomers Homepage , a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a set of news items about upcoming appearances by the young actress . First of all , the site is reporting that on the 25th of October PAX-tv will rerun Pomers ' ' Touched by an Angel ' episode , ' The Sky is Falling ' . In addition , she 'll of course also feature in Wednesday 's ' Dark Frontier ' rerun , and in the upcoming episode ' Dragon 's Teeth ' . Secondly , Pomers has two public appearances scheduled in Los Angeles and in Orlando . Take a look : <p> On Halloween , Scarlett will be signing autographs at Universal Studios Hollywood at a benefit for the Ronald McDonald Kids Cancer Camp . Then , on November 13-14 , she will travel to Orlando , Fl to appear at Vulkon ( sci-fi convention ) . She will be signing autographs , speaking on stage , and even peforming a few songs !

The latest entry to season six , " Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy , " is a refreshingly funny comic piece that ranks among the better Trek comedies , and probably the best-executed since DS9 's " In the Cards .

Find it all here . <p> More Voyager Cast PhotosChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) As you may recall , a few weeks ago two great publicity stills appeared on the net , showing the Voyager cast out of costume , dressed in stylish black outfits . Now , RanDoM Flight , the official fan club of Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) , has put up the rest of the photos from this photo session , consisting of individual photos of the cast members . You can find the photos by visiting RanDoM Flight 's Season 6 Gallery . Sorry for not reporting on this earlier - apparently sometime in the past few months the site moved from its old AOL address to Geocities , and I had n't noticed . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to this . <p> New Starfleet Command ReviewChristian ( 6:15 pm CST ) You 'd think everyone would have played the game by now , but apparently the people at Game Forces felt otherwise , as they 've just put up a review of Interplay 's ' Starfleet Command ' . In the review , the game is awarded 4 stars : <p> Starfleet Command shows all the signs of an excellent game , there are just some things that got left out . Regardless , this title is bound to keep you in for a long time -- exploring the many races , spacecraft , and missions available . Multiplayer just adds more to the re-playability . <p> Send Picardo A Birthday WishChristian ( 6:15 pm CST ) Two days from now , it will be the 46th birthday of Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) and , as usual , his official fan club is offering you the chance to send him a birthday greeting .

Like most other reviewers , Steve Perry at TrekWeb does n't exactly appear to be in love with ' Alice ' , Voyager 's latest new episode . Take a look at how he starts his review : <p> Thank God " Alice " does n't air here any more . I 'd hate to see her show up again , and I seriously doubt any follow up would be as good as the excellent " Course : Oblivion " was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice " was devoid of all idea content , completely paint by numbers and badly done even by that . We 've seen these episodes before . Usually they try to ask a question , like maybe is the ship really sentient , but here Alice was quickly made into an unredeemable baddie , with no clear motivation besides " I want to get to the particle fountain . " What in the world were they thinking ? <p> Fairfield Con ReportChristian ( 6:14 pm CST ) NikkiDeBoer.com has posted a report of Fanfest 99 , a convention held in Fairfield , California last Sunday . Being written for a fan site for Nicole deBoer ( Ezri Dax ) , the report mostly deals with deBoer 's appearance . According to the report , deBoer told the usual convention stories about her casting and about her first meeting with William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) , but apparently she also provided some info about her upcoming wedding : <p> Okay that 's really all the stories I can remember , but a couple of other interesting points : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's heavy into wedding plans right now ! . Most of you know her mom 's from Glasgow . Came to Canada with her sister , and parents too of course , when she was 7 . Nicole recently got to go there and meet up with family she had never seen before . Her parents are divorced and her mother is remarried . Her father is Dutch/German . Um sounds like she had a close nit family , although there are very few of them . But happily it 's about to get bigger , as John comes from a large family . She told a funny story of how she went to see his mom one day , and had some of her Star Trek pictures with her . And has her mother-in-law to be was going through them , she was pulling them out say ' I 'll take this one and that one . ' She than proceeded to remove John 's pictures from the family gallery wall and replace them with Nicole 's . She figures she 's just one of the gang now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice to hear her father is half-Dutch/half-German , by the way - so is my father . <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' ImpressionsChristian ( 6:14 pm CST ) Evil Avatar has posted a short article by Raven 's Pat Lipo , in which the Project Leader ( not working on ' Elite Force ' ) tells us about his impressions of the Voyager game . Obviously , this preview is written from a somewhat biased perspective , but it still makes the game sound incredibly great : <p> Usually when you see an in-game cinematic while playing a PC game , it involves static shots , awkward timing , and stilted dialogue . In contrast , what I saw programmer Mike Gummelt working on really surprised me . He showed a scene that started with the main character and other members of his team working on the holodeck . Without going into detail as to the plot of the scene , the camera is set well to convey the emotion of the moment as the other team members walk past him and leave the holodeck . Tuvok begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , framing the scene and moving with the two actors as they continued down the hallway , while another crew member in the background starts a new program on the holodeck and enters . The two enter the turbolift and continue their conversation , just like a scene might occur in the show . <p> More on the in-game cinematics can be found in the full preview , which , unless I 'm very much mistaken , also includes a new screenshot showing us the first glimpse of a Klingon Bird of Prey . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 6:13 pm CST ) -On Tuesday in the United States , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the first-season TOS episode ' Tomorrow Is Yesterday ' at 5:00pm Eastern Time . <p> -On Tuesday in the United Kingdom , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The Search , Part Two ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , according to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . <p> Hello World !

In the interview , Shimerman looks back at DS9 's final season , talks about the Ferengi episodes and his Ferengi novel ' The 34th Rule ' , and criticises the fact that Ezri Dax was featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must say that as much as I 'm a big fan of Nicole deBoer , the first part of the season was really the Nicole deBoer show . I know we had to set that character up , but there was just a tremendous amount of focus on that , so much so that I think even Nicole would have said , ' Enough already . I 've got too much . ' And she did have some hard times when she realised that she was going to be the lead in every single episode in the first part of the last season .

Cynic David E. Sluss just uploaded his review of ' Alice ' , providing a rather complete look at all the episode 's bad points . Here are his two first criticisms : <p> VOYAGER CLICHE OF THE WEEK : " There 's an unauthorized shuttle launch ! " " Close the door ! " " Too late ! " In the history of Voyager ( and Star Trek in general ) , has an unauthorized shuttle launch ever been stopped in the shuttle bay ? <p> VOYAGER CLICHE OF THE WEEK RUNNER-UP : A couple more mentions of the hated deuterium appear in this episode . By now , Braga and company must have heard of the problem with Voyager 's treatment of the real-world substance ; it 's as if they are deliberately ignoring it and/or giving the middle finger to those who like a little science in their science fiction .

The interview contains the exciting news that , unlike in most of ' Starfleet Academy ' , you will actually be able to graduate and fly some real missions in the game : <p> Federation HQ : And the missions will presumably follow a storyline ? Or will they be stand-alone with some mini-campaigns like in SFA ? <p> Ron Hodge : The missions follow two story lines .

The second is a real life Klingon civil war , and the missions follow the progression of the civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate from the academy and go on some real missions to kick Federation butt ? <p> Ron Hodge : You graduate from the academy about halfway through the game , and the second half is a real civil war . <p> Lots more info , including a rather detailed explanation of the game 's control system , can be found in the full interview . <p> CIC Box Sets AnnouncedChristian ( 5:48 pm CST ) The Great Link is reporting about two new box sets which CIC UK will be releasing in December 1999 .

Click here to avoid these spoilers . <p> UPN 44 , which as far as I can tell is located in San Francisco , has put up summaries of ' Dragon 's Teeth ' and ' One Small Step ' , which will air on the 10th and the 17th of November , respectively . Take a look : <p> DRAGON 'S TEETH ( episode #607 ) To avoid a surprise attack , our crew lands on a planet where they encounter a species that has been in stasis for almost 900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of this species . In return , she promises to find a suitable planet for this species to take over . Later , Janeway learns that this species is quite violent and is bent on using Voyager 's technology to create and expand their violent culture . In the end , Janeway is able to negotiate with the attackers to defeat this violent species . <p> ONE SMALL STEP ( episode #608 ) Our crew encounters a strange energy field out in space that has collected all sorts of space matter . Included in the space craft that was used for the first manned mission to Mars in 2032 . In the process of trying to retrieve it , the away team 's craft is damaged . Seven is sent aboard the old Mars craft for parts . On this ship , Seven finds the preserved remains of the captain of that Mars mission . Seven beams him aboard the ship and he is given a proper burial . <p> This comes from UPN 44 's Voyager page , which can be found here . Thanks go out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V ArticleChristian ( 5:47 pm CST ) Christopher Howell at the Great Link has re-printed a very interesting article about Series V , which first appeared in the December 1999 issue of SFX Magazine . In it , they talk to Trek historian and ' Free Enterprise ' producer Mark Altman , and an unnamed inside source at Paramount . The article contains a few interesting quotes which I thought I 'd also put up here : <p> What the next series will be seems to be the key question at this moment , and there have been a wide variety of rumours floating around , among them a show dealing with the Klingons , another that resurrects Captain Kirk , and most of which surround Starfleet Academy and a Top Gun-like setting . The most recent , however involves a crew of cadets on a vessel named " Excellent " . One source dose to the situation who wishes to remain anonymous told SFX , " They keep denying the Flight Academy idea , but that 's the leading contender right now . The studio wants to see something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next movie on a ship with a new crew . Nothing 's been firmed up . The one thing that is firm is that it 'll be Rick Berman and Brannon Braga who will create it . " <p> ... <p> Of the rumours surrounding the new series , Altman adds , " I 've heard everything from the Time Police to the 28th Century after the Federation has collapsed which was a pet idea of Robert Wolfe and Ira Behr . I think they 'll probably be conservative and go with either another ship or another Enterprise . I 'm in the minority when I say I like the Starfleet Academy idea . I think it 's a way to get back to what appealed to me about the original Star Trek the idea of a bunch of people who are optimistic about the future trying to make changes . People who were inspired into public service . It sort of taps into the Kennedy New Frontier-ism that inspired Classic Trek 's Final Frontier . I think you can deal with a lot of contemporary issues like interracial dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also attract a younger demographic to the show . Ship shows in Star Trek have been done to death . " <p> I certainly agree with Altman on this - having another Trek ship show would almost certainly be the end of the franchise . In any case , you can find the full article here - it also contains speculations on the next movie , Ron Moore 's departure , and more ! <p> Activision Launch PartyChristian ( 5:46 pm CST ) Marc Dultz at Gamecenter has put up a report about a recent Activision launch party in Manhattan , organised to promote the company 's upcoming releases for the holiday season . Of course , ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil ' was also shown there : <p> Set nine months after the events portrayed in the feature film Star Trek : Insurrection , Star Trek : Hidden Evil takes players back to the mystical planet of Ba'ku .

Recently , regular Trek Nation contributor Karen Comer saw the play , and she was kind enough to write a review of it : <p> It takes a True Trek Fan to travel to LA just to see her favorite actor in a small play in a 99 seat theater . That 's just what I did this October in Los Angeles to see Marc Alaimo in " The Greeks " - I was even awakened by the recent earthquake . In ' The Greeks ' , Marc plays Agamemnon , king or general of the Greek army , I could never discern which . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors ' performance , and talks about her encounter with one of the fellow theatre visitors - Casey Biggs ( Damar ) ! Find her full review here , together with a lovely photo of Alaimo in his role of Agamemnon . <p> Naming the Emotional Mediocre Hollowgraphic Doctor ! For some reason , the Doctor just does n't seem to want to give himself a name . Perhaps the reason is everytime he chose a name , someone ended up dying ! <p> In the new edition of his ' Trailer Park ' column for AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine , Rob Allstetter has posted a rather detailed synopsis of ' Dragon 's Teeth ' , an episode about which very little was yet known . Take a look at how Allstetter summarises the episode , which will air on the 10th of November : <p> Voyager accidentally drifts into a sub-space corridor and is attacked by the Turei , a territorial race whose armada forces Janeway and her crew to take shelter on a ravaged planet , where they encounter another warlike species whose survivors are encased in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turei , Janeway makes repairs while on a planet whose civilization lies in ruins save for a few hundred stasis chambers holding the slumbering remnants of the Vaadwaur , an ancient culture thought to be extinct .

Take a look at two highlights : <p> Query From : Mike Urvand Have you given any more thought about a New Frontier series ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte Thinking about it all the time . I 'm confident that there will be a series or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The artwork previews I 've seen do look cool , and the plot outlines sound intriguing . I can hardly wait for new ST comics ! Will there be any Wildstorm ST preview / ashcan comics produced ? And how can I get one ? Thanks . <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte There was a preview book released at Comic Con International : San Diego . It was black and white , just stapled , and contained art from " False Colors " and " Perchance to Dream . " It was very limited , and long gone . But you do n't have to wait much longer for the books themselves ! <p> More answers ( dealing with things such as the DS9 comics , the involvement of Trek novel authors with the comics , and several release dates ) can be found in the full update .

Take a look : <p> During negotiations with the Kesat government , Tuvok is zapped by a powerful energy force , suffers severe neurological trauma and emerges as a mere shell of his former self . Meanwhile Janeway searches for the mythical species responsible for the attack hopes of finding a cure . <p> The original version can be found here , though it of course is n't any different from what I posted here . <p> More On Straczynski On TrekChristian ( 5:49 pm CST ) Following yesterday 's news report about the October issue of the British Dreamwatch Magazine , in which Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski was reported to have said that he had been approached to work on Star Trek , Gustavo Leao sent in the actual quote from the magazine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would have been nice for me to come and take over the television aspect of it , while others go off and do the film division , but I thought about it for all of about three seconds , then said no . " JMS told reporter Paul Simpson " Naturally , it was a good oportunity , but a ) I do n't want to go and do somebody else 's show and b ) the shit fight over 's Claudia Christian and the Trek fans to whom I am anathema , I did n't want to begin to deal with that . So I said ' Do n't even begin to start investigating this , trying to push this . It ai n't going to happen . You do n't have enough money ' . Its never been about the money for with me . I 've got to have fun . It 's too damn hard to do it if you are not enjoying it " . <p> I wonder if this is really true , or if it 's yet another round in Straczynski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , major thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for sending this in ! <p> Roddenberry Remembered In AdChristian ( 5:48 pm CST ) SARGON just sent in a scan of an ad which appeared on page 2 of Friday 's edition of the Hollywood Reporter . The ad features a photo of Gene Roddenberry , the quote " A Kinder , Better and More Gentle World " , and then " His Vision Lives - Gene Roddenberry , 8/19/21 - 10/24/91 " . Unfortunately the ad apparently did n't say who placed it , but presumably it 's either Paramount , or Majel Barrett-Roddenberry , or both .

Christian ( 5:46 pm CST ) After a rather long hiatus , we 're finally re-launching the Trek Nation article section ! Today we 've already put up a play review by Karen Comer and a new edition of Jeff Mariotte 's comics Q&amp;A , and over the next few days we 'll be putting up things such as an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Trek hate sites and the effects of the original series , and lots , lots more ! As always , if you also have ideas for Trek Nation articles , please do send them in to articles@treknation.com , as we 'd love to publish your thoughts on anything Trek-related ! <p> Friday October 22 , 1999 <p> Eon Brannon Braga InterviewChristian ( 6:00 pm CST ) The new edition of Eon Magazine have put up a new interview with Brannon Braga , Voyager 's Executive Producer . As is usual for their interviews , it is more than interesting , with Braga talking about the current status of Voyager as the only Trek show on air , the change of Trek into a business , and even the age-old attacks on Braga himself . Here 's a short quote : <p> I 've been accused by many fans for reasons that go back eight years ago , for ignoring STAR TREK lore of being disdainful of STAR TREK and its fans and nothing could be further from the truth . I 've lived and breathed this stuff for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything that 's been done . Everything we 're going to do . Things that have been done already . Stories , chronology , all that stuff is so complicated . When you come up with a cool idea , you run with it , but you have to keep in mind the larger context of 500 episodes of STAR TREK and nine movies . You ca n't ignore it . You just ca n't . Just the other day , we had two scripts we were getting ready to shoot back to back , and we realized they both had titles from the original series : " Wink of an Eye " and " Arena . " We had to change them . <p> This certainly sounds very re-assuring , in light of the fact that Braga will presumably be one of the two most important people working on Trek for the near future . In the rest of the interview , he provides a few new spoilers about ' Pathfinder ' ( which will apparently have a major influence on the rest of the series ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving out any real info ) , and he mentions how he looks at Trek internet sites quite often ( Hi Brannon ! ) . Find it all here . <p> ' Alice ' Tube ReviewChristian ( 5:48 pm CST ) Voyager 's great season start definitely seems to have ended with ' Alice ' , as almost all the rveiewers we 've seen so far truly hate the episode . Reviewer Jeff Bond at Eon 's Tube Reviews is no excepting , deeming the episode unworthy of receiving more than a D. Here 's a snippet : <p> The final , melodramatic face-offs between Paris and Alice have to be seen to be believed--it 's really laughable stuff , and it 's a pity because this is one of the few VOYAGER episodes to try and match the pacing and intensity of one of the original series episodes . But melodrama worked on the old show because of the theatricality of the actors and scripts that were compelling--here it just seems like much blustering about nothing , and how many times do we have to see Paris go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pretty much a complete waste of time for all concerned . <p> Voyager Schedule UpdatedChristian ( 5:48 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi has updated the Voyager air schedule for both the ' regular ' and the syndicated episodes . The info includes the confirmed Voyager air schedule for November and December , up to the Troi/Barclay episode ' Pathfinder ' , and info on the 8th week of syndication , ' Borg on Board ' , including episodes such as ' Unity ' and ' Scorpion ' . The full schedule can be found here . <p> Mania Looks At Fan FictionChristian ( 5:47 pm CST ) In the new edition of her Hailing Frequencies column ( confusingly titled the same way as Julia Houston 's weekly newsletter at About.com ) , Michelle Erica Green takes a look at the phenomenon of fan fiction on the net , both for Trek and other sci-fi shows . Here 's what you 'll be able to find in her article : <p> I was reading an article in a San Francisco newspaper a couple of weeks ago with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized what 's wrong with all these articles and books : none of them comes with a list of addresses ! Some of them mention the really big newsgroups , but none of them tell fans how to find the BLTs ( Better Living Through Trek Smut ) , nor which slash archive contains crossover material like Xander from Buffy meeting Michael from La Femme Nikita and ... oh , you get the idea . <p> So here is a by-no-means-complete listing of fan fiction I 've stumbled across that I think is worth reading . Just as no one under 18 should be buying some of the anime tapes carried by Another Universe , so no one under 18 should be reading the sites on this list which warn you away . ( Note : I do n't swear that all or any of these links are current or will work at any given time ; these are the ones I have bookmarked and refer to when I have spare time , which is not often . ) <p> The actual fanfic listing can be found by reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the X-Files , Trek , Hercules and Xena , Babylon 5 , the Sentinel , La Femme Nikita , and several other shows . <p> IGN Sci-Fi ' Alice ' ReviewChristian ( 5:47 pm CST ) And it seems reviewer Blake Fischer did n't exactly enjoy the episode . Awarding it precisely 1 out of 5 stars , he delivers his most negative review since the start of the season : <p> Besides being the worst-paced episode in recent memory , the plot was so trite and predictable we did n't even want to stay to watch the whole show ( of course , we had to because , who knows , something good might have happened . ) Even the acting was of lower quality than usual with cast members just strolling around the ship casually as if this were the Quaaludes episode . <p> If you missed this , lucky you . If not , trust us , the show is usually much better than this one . <p> An Activision executive involved with the projects told us a little more about the intersection of the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek : Q Continuum will be an online game , it wo n't be something along the lines of EverQuest or Ultima Online . Activision is planning one of those , but has yet to sign a developer . ... At best , the game ( currently envisioned as an ongoing adventure ) is two or three years down the road . <p> Star Trek : Q Continuum , though , is still on track . The game , which WRE has learned is being developed by Genetic Anomalies , is expected to be released in Activision 's next fiscal year ( meaning at least six months from now - probably more ) . When it comes out , expect a product similar to Genetic Anomalies ' Chron-X . An insider described the game as a " Star Trek Risk " with a heavy dash of Magic thrown in . <p> A few more details on ' Q Continuum ' , plus a bit of background info on that distant massively multiplayer game , can be found in the full report . Thanks go out ( again ) to Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5:46 pm CST ) The new edition of Eon Magazine features a review of Volumes 3 and 4 of the Classic Trek DVDs , which were just released by Paramount Home Video . Awarding the discs a solid A , the ( unnamed ) reviewers at Eon still love the DVDs : <p> The second set of Classic STAR TREK DVDs has warped into orbit , and Volumes 3 and 4 are just as big a treat for Trekkers as the first set was . Maybe the thrill of owning TREK on DVD has worn off just a little bit , but this set still offers four pretty great episodes that showcase the series in its hard-edged , early stages of development . You can say one thing about the original series in comparison to its three sequels : it hit the ground running , with fully-developed characters , a dynamic visual style and strong , hard-hitting drama while shows like THE NEXT GENERATION and VOYAGER took several years to find their spacelegs , if they found them at all . <p> Reviews of the actual episodes featured on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CCG Second Anthology Card PreviewChristian ( 5:46 pm CST ) In a short new article , Evan Lorentz at Decipher offers a preview of one of the six new cards which fans of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game will be able to find in the upcoming ' Second Anthology ' project .

Major thanks go out to Holly Kim Wilson for pointing me to it ! <p> Experience Halloween Costume ContestChristian ( 5:45 pm CST ) Best Fares Online , presumably an online travel agent , has an article about about the ' Second Annual Alien Bash and Costume Contest ' , which will be held in Quark 's Bar in the Las Vegas ' Star Trek : Experience ' on the 30th of November . The event will be held from 8:00pm to midnight , and is expected to be a yearly tradition following last year 's appearance of more than 500 aliens . Take a look at what you 'll be able to expect from the event : <p> The festivities feature a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specials all night long . On the judging panel are award-winning make-up artist and Star Trek veteran , Michael Westmore , and Mark Allen Shepherd , " Morn " from Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . <p> The ante has been upped at this one-of-a-kind costume party to offer even bigger rewards . First place carries a $1,500 cash prize ; second $750 ; third $500 ; and a $350 Star Trek : The Experience leather bomber jacket for fourth place .

Admission to the attraction , comprising a museum and ride , is an additional $15.95 . <p> Stewart Biographer 's New Book SuspendedChristian ( 5:45 pm CST ) According to an article by Reuters ' Patrick Rizzo , the New York publishing company St. Martin 's Press has suspended selling and promoting the book ' Fortunate Son : George W. Bush and The Making of an American President ' , written by James H. Hartfield . This was done after the Dallas Morning News said on Thursday that Dallas court records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trying to have his ex-boss killed . Hartfield 's book was already a controversial one , as it alleged that presidential candidate George W. Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 , but had the matter cleared from his criminal record after his father intervened , a claim which both Bushes strongly deny . Star Trek fans will know Hatfield from his apparently pretty good previous book , Patrick Stewart : The Unauthorized Biography . For the full story on his new book 's suspension , go here . <p> Insurrection Out On VideoChristian ( 5:45 pm CST ) Besides the Garrett Wang chat , it appears I also forget to mention that ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' is now actually out as a home video .

If anyone in the UK bought the mag , please drop me a line - I 'd love to get a summary of the Berman interview . <p> Patrick Stewart ( " Star Trek : The Next Generation " ) and Hector Elizondo ( " Chicago Hope " ) star in a psychological thriller depicting a retired government official who is suffering from Alzheimer 's disease and believes that a presidential candidate is trying to kill him .

Until now , all we knew was that they would be involved in some project to bring Voyager home . Thanks to our regular source Creep , we 're now able to bring you a somewhat more detailed plot synopsis : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is charged with bringing home Voyager from the Delta Quadrant . The project idea is to open a small artificial wormhole near Voyager and hold it open long enough for the ship to see it and come through . But the project leads want to know how the crew will react to the opportunity , and how they might present it to maximize the probability that Voyager will take it . So Barclay ( now married ) sets up a holodeck simulation of the Voyager crew , running through various permutations to test their viability . As he does , he becomes obsessed with them , their lives and their situation , regressing back into his holo-diction from TNG 's ' Hollow Pursuits ' . The holo-diction takes over Barclay 's life , threatening his job , his marriage , etc. and Counselor Troi is brought in to snap him out of it for the second time . Here 's a shocker : Voyager does NOT come home at the end of the episode . <p> This certainly sounds interesting , though I do wonder if we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode . Of course , major thanks go out to Creep for this ! <p> Jeri Ryan Movie Premieres TodayChristian ( 6:24 pm CST ) Just on time , the official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage is reporting that today , Thursday , is the world premiere of ' The Last Man ' , another independent film starring Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) . Ryan herself will actually be attending the premiere , so Trek fans in New York ( where the premiere is held ) will certainly want to attend . According to the JLR Homepage , the film is a ' comedy about the last three people on earth and their terrible relationship problems . ' Info on the New York premiere , plus news of an LA premiere in November which Ryan will also be attending , can be found at the JLR Homepage 's news page . <p> This is a really encouraging season so far .

The game is currently set for release sometime between 6 and 18 months from now , and very little is yet known about it : <p> The company did n't release details about the game 's plot , nor name the developer , though it did mention that it had recently entered into a relationship with Totally Games , the company that developed X-Wing vs .

Thanks go out to the Federation HQ for this ! <p> " Alice " performed on par with the last few weeks , earning Voyager 's third straight 4.7 rating , 7 share . That 's level from " Barge of the Dead " and last week 's " Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy .

Though operating profit rose by 60% per share , the company 's net profit was sharply down , due to a one-time charge related to the acquisition of Spelling Entertainment : <p> Viacom , owner of MTV , Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures , said Thursday third-quarter net profits dropped 22 percent after a charge related to the purchase of Spelling Entertainment .

Christian ( 6:17 pm CST ) Somehow we seem to have skipped autumn here in the Netherlands . First we had the hottest September since the second World War , and now it appears we 're headed for the coldest October ever . Or at least it feels that way . Temperatures are below zero during the night , but even during the day I feel like my nose is freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm sweaters today , but I doubt even with those I 'll be much inclined to spend my days outside . <p> Wednesday October 20 , 1999 <p> ' Elite Force ' Internal Demo Christian ( 5:12 pm CST ) Raven Software 's Brian Pelletier recently updated his . plan file , talking about a game demo he showed to the Activision management . With the demo , Raven had to prove that they were able to make a convincing artificial intelligence system for the characters in the game , and that the scripted events would be interactive . Judging from Pelletier 's description of the demo , Raven more than succeeded in doing this : <p> The demo went something like this : Beam into a Borg Cube with 4 NPC away team members . There are Borg in the room you are in but they ignore you . if you shoot them , then they will attack you or course . As you walk through the Cube your teammate follow right along with you and do n't get in your way . They even talk amongst themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you start walking toward you and your tema . One of your teammates say 's " should I shoot the Borg sir ? " the player has the option now to respone with a yes or no command ( Y and N keys ) and control the action of the NPC teammate . if you press Y ( yes ) then he shoots the Borg . But by doing that the Borg you left alone at the begining will come and attack you . If you press N ( no ) then he lowers his weapon and the Borg walks right by ; unless you attacked the Borg in the begining . If so the the Borg will walk up to that teammate and try to assimilate him . this is an example of our interactive scripts . <p> In the full . plan update , Pelletier talks some more about the way the various team members react to each other , and I really wish I could have quoted all of it here . Instead , you can find it all in the full update . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The German Star Trek Index is reporting that Charles Rettinghaus , the German voice actor who did the voice of Geordi LaForge for the German version of TNG , has just released his first CD . The CD , which ties in with a German anti-drugs campaign , describes the fear of a father that his daughter might become addicted to drugs . The name of the CD is ' Ich krieg Dich ' , German for ' I 'll catch you ' . Info on how to buy the CD , plus a chance to win a copy , can be found here . <p> Seeing a good portion of its ratings disappear to the AL Championship Series , " Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy " managed only a 3.5 rating , 5 share . That 's down 8% from " Barge of the Dead " ' s 3.8/6 last week and 5% from last year 's comparable episode , " Drone , " which earned a 3.7/6 . " Tinker " turned in the lowest ratings of the season to date and was the only episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager did manage a tie for 5th place in its timeslot despite the dip from last week , tying with the surprisingly weak " Roswell , " which dropped a whopping 29% in its second week to a 3.5/5 ( down from a 4.9/7 ) . <p> A comparison with the other networks , a look at the division in ratings between the first and the second Voyager half hour , and an outlook to the future can be found in the full report . <p> Jammer Reviews ' Barge'Christian ( 5:11 pm CST ) Jamahl Epsicokhan at Star Trek : Hypertext , still somewhat behind with his reviews , has put up his analysis of ' Barge of the Dead ' , the third episode of the season . Awarding it the maximum four stars , Jamahl absolutely loved the episode : <p> " Barge " comes together as the best overall episode of Voyager in nearly a year , if not longer--and one of the series ' best . It 's a story that understands its central character and puts her through a wringer where she learns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character overall has been ( excluding some of the fifth-season schizophrenia , of course ) . <p> AVault Previews ' DS9 : The Fallen'Christian ( 5:10 pm CST ) David Laprad at the Adrenaline Vault has written a new preview of ' Deep Space Nine : The Fallen ' , the Collective 's upcoming third-person shooter . The preview contains an interesting paragraph of the game 's third-person perspective , which many people felt severely limited the game 's chance of succeeding : <p> In recent times , there has been some interesting debate among gamers about the potential of the third-person perspective , since a number of over-the-shoulder titles have not sold well , but for The Collective , it was never an issue . According to Hare , one of the appealing aspects of a licensed property is its characters , which the designers wanted to place front and center in order to further immerse gamers . In addition , a third-person viewpoint was critical to allowing the intricate navigational acrobatics the team is implementing , such as tumbling , hanging off ledges , swinging on ropes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible with the first-person perspective . <p> As I mentioned above , the accomplishments of the programmers in this respect are unheralded to date . Sure , it is the standard behind-the-shoulders perspective , with the mouse being used to pitch the camera up and down to view the surroundings , but some mindful adjustments hacve been made . There is a bit of lag built in so that mouse-turning is smoother and less visually disruptive than other titles , for example , and when a character retreats into a wall , he or she fades so the player can see through them . Essentially , the camera remains in the same orientation at all times , but can get closer or farther away depending on obstacles . I have never seen a third-person title with this great of a feel , and it should silence critics . <p> The full three-page preview contains a few quotes from the game 's designers , a look at the game 's unique method of handling character speech , and another 12 screenshots . Find it all here . <p> Trek Stars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reporting that Andrews McMeel Publishing has just published a new book by David Kristol and Todd W. Nickerson , called ' Predictions for the Next Millennium ' . The book consists of interviews with celebrities , asking them for their predictions for the upcoming Millennium . Two of the stars featured in this book are LeVar Burton ( Geordi LaForge ) and Nichelle Nichols ( Uhura ) , who both share Star Trek 's positive outlook on the future . Of the two , Nichols ' prediction is certainly the most colourful : <p> Nichelle Nichols envisions fusion energy plants and robotic laboroers by 2020 , colonization of the Moon and Mars by 2050 and by the year 3000 , " Earth 's politicians are taking interplanetary economic lessons from alien beings in ( an ) attempt to learn how to operate a covernment without taxing people to death .

Awarding the episode an A , Perry is just as enthusiastic as most of the other reviewers : <p> ROTFL . Does n't that say it all ? Ok , it 's now pure science fiction , it does n't deal with the human condition , but if Trek can get away with a comedy about anybody , it should be able to do it with one of its Pinocchio characters . It seems more likely to me that the question of sentience and what is life is better dealt with by showing the Doctor deal with real concerns through fanciful means within his mind than it is by a straightforward and dry moral dilemma . <p> Just a clever , clever episode . The teaser alone is worth the price of admission . Taking " La Donna Mobile " - and oh how innocently did the Doctor set the scene up - and making it into a song about Pon Farr was just brilliant . Absolutely brilliant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole episode of these things . <p> A more detailed analysis can be found in the full review . TrekWeb 's ' Barge of the Dead ' review should apparently be posted in a few days . <p> Happy Birthday !

Fischer is more positive than he has ever been , awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars : <p> We 'll go out on a ( fairly short ) limb here and say that this is one of the most refreshing and creative episodes of Voyager we 've ever seen . Through the humor of the doctor 's daydreaming ( which flows seamlessly from reality ) we get a unique insight into his program and -- dare we say it -- his soul . <p> In fact , what begins as a mass of confusion ultimately is a touching trip into the redemption of the Doctor , as well as the crew .

Take a look at a few highlights from the chat : <p> Regina from Germany asks : If you could write a script for a Doctor based Voyager Episode , what would you make him say and do ( what would the story be like ) ? <p> Robert Picardo : I have always wanted to do an episode in which a medical emergency demands that the doctor have a qualified co-surgeon for a delicate procedure .

However , the season 1 doctor -- arrogant , self-rightous , terrible bedside manner -- is assisting our new , improved , adapted doctor who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor is humiliated by the behavior of his early self . And the new doctor thinks the current doctor is foolish and basically a waste of time for having such trivial concerns as people 's feelings . <p> Gene asks : How did you film the scene when you sketched Seven of Nine nude ?

I must first of all blow my own horn and say that that was my own idea . The writers asked what some of the doctor 's fantasies might be and I think that was the first one out of my mouth . Of course it was shot with great dignity and Jeri was completely covered up , much to my dismay , so to my mind , she 'll owe me the complete nude sometime in the future . Just kidding ! Besides , I would lie to protect her dignity , no matter what actually happened . But what actually happened was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The full transcript can be found here . It 's fun as usual and really worth checking out - Picardo is his usual entertaining self . <p> Vulcan Regional CCG ReportChristian ( 5:29 pm CST ) Evan Lorentz at Decipher , the publisher of the official Star Trek Customizable Card Game , has put up a report of the recent ' Vulcan Regional Championships ' , held in Denver , Colorado . In total , 20 players took part in the event , and competition was said to be ' extremely difficult ' . Take a look at a short description of the strategies used during the championships : <p> There were plenty of head games to accompany the games of Star Trek being played . Although the region is well known for an abundance of strong Borg decks , not one player chose the affiliation on this occasion . Longtime Romulan players switched to Federation , Cardassian fans were running Klingons , and many of the game 's most popular strategies including Q-bypass and Space-Time Portal drop were nowhere to be seen . <p> Today On TVChristian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the first-season TOS episode ' The Conscience of the King ' . 163809 @qwx573809 <p> -Tomorrow at 15:00 CET , German Sat.1 will be showing DS9 's ' Der Streik ' . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:29 pm CST ) It truly is amazing . I spent practically all day working on site stuff and answering email , and I 'm still not completely finished . There goes my free evening tomorrow : - ( . <p> Saturday October 16 , 1999 <p> Sci-FI Entertainment Trek IssueChristian ( 6:28 pm CST ) Gustavo Leao just sent in a report about the December issue of Sci-Fi Entertainment Magazine , which celebrates the 20th anniversary of ' Star Trek : The Motion Picture ' . The magazine contains a detailed retrospective on the making of the movie , plus all-new interviews with the film 's cast and crew . <p> Besides that , the new issue also contains a group interview with the Voyager cast and Executive Producer Brannon Braga , in which they talk about Voyager 's sixth season and its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article is accompanied by new photos of the cast members out of costume , which look like they came from the same photo shoot as the recently published pictures of the ' Cast In Black ' . <p> Get ready for Rules of Acquisition ! Hot on the heels of Blaze of Glory , this new expansion for the Star Trek CCG is going to once again revolutionize the game with 130 cards , including the long-awaited addition of a fully playable Ferengi affiliation . <p> It 's a bit early for us to confirm a release date , but Rules of Acquisition is still figuring heavily into our plans for Decipher Con . It will figure very heavily into the plans of the competitors coming to the 1999 World Championships . <p> In the full article , we get to hear about how this expansion will affect the World Championships , while we also get to take a first look at no less than 12 new cards from the expansion set ! Thanks go out to Tom Aylward-Nally and 4-GOM for this . <p> Query from : Mike John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some authors who have been absent from the world of ST for awhile . I was wondering if they would be writing any more ST novels soon . The authors are A.C. Crispin , J.M. Dillard , Jean Lorrah , Howard Weinstein and Carmen Carter . <p> Response from : John Ordover I 'm speaking with Crispin about a possible future project ; Dillard still does our hardcover movie novelizations but is busy with her original fiction under the name Kalogridis . Jean Lorrah and Carmen Carter are similarly busy , Howie has a proposal in . <p> Query from : Amy ... Last but not least , here are a few more names for the list of great ST authors who have n't had a ST novel published in a while : John M. " The Final Reflection " Ford ( I 'd love to see what he could do with the newer developments in Klingon culture ) , Robert Vardeman , and Vonda McIntire . Also , if memory serves me right , it 's been a few years since John Vornholt has published a ST novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mcintire and Vardeman are busy with other projects . John V. has had a number of Trek novels in the last year or two , including MIND MELD and the two TNG Dominion war books . He has a two-book TNG series , GEMWORLD , coming out next Feb . <p> Yes , we 've all heard the Federation 's party line : " Star Trek does n't need saving . Voyager is a UPN ratings powerhouse . " But taking solace in the fact that a 33-year-old , billion-dollar franchise routinely outranks the likes of Shasta McNasty ( while getting smacked down by the WWF ) is n't going to change the reality on the final frontier : Voyager viewership is down from last year , even though it 's now the only Star Trek show in town . So allow us to help you chart a new course . <p> I wonder where Mr. Bernardin got his information from - for once , Voyager 's ratings have not gone down compared to last season . In any case , after that Bernardin continues with some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he apparently feels should be ' Star Trek : Mercy Point ' . You can find the full transcript here . Thanks go out to Paris Lover for alerting me of this ! <p> New Starfleet JournalChristian ( 6:18 pm CST ) Slightly delayed , the people at the TrekNews Network have put up volume 2 , issue 9 of their monthly Trek e-zine . As the site just premiered a new design , and is currently in a period of online beta testing , there are a bit less articles than usual , though the SFJ still features its usual set of great columns . This month , the site has new colums by Heather Jarman , looking at the upcoming Janeway love affair , Jim Wright , looking back at DS9 , and Claudia Roedel , talking about Trek in Brazil . More features will undoubtedly appear soon at the Starfleet Journal . <p> 1999 Roddenberry Awards ResultsChristian ( 6:17 pm CST ) I just noticed that Jason Davidson at Star Trek News has put up the results for this year 's Roddenberry Awards , his site 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner this year was the episode ' The Siege Of AR-558 ' , which won no less than three awards in categories such as ' Outstanding Dramatic Presentation ' and ' Social Significance ' .

Philharmonic , which also featured a theatre reading of Shakespeare 's ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' , starring Brent Spiner ( Data ) as Nick Bottom . The first review is a professional one , written by Variety 's Alan Rich , who felt the event gave the L.A. Philharmonic a dream start of the new concert season . The second review is written by Brent Spiner fan Okie , who of course mostly talks about Spiner 's performance in his/her report . <p> The New York Post reports that the high-school senior took to heart such Ferengi rules as " Laws are made to be broken , especially by businessmen " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing eBay bidders software to get the same products for lower prices .

Spent pretty much the whole day working on ' behind-the-scenes ' site stuff and answering email - hopefully by the time the weekend is over I wo n't be so incredibly behind anymore . <p> Trek Experience ArticleChristian ( 6:16 pm CST ) Julia Houston at About.com 's Star Trek Fans , recently returned from the About.com convention in Las Vegas , has put up a new article dealing with the ' Star Trek : Experience ' , the Trek attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel . Here 's how the article starts : <p> The beer was red , bright red nail polish red . The Romulan ale was for some unfathomable reason green instead of blue , so I suppose any shade of red did okay for " Klingon Bloodwine . " But it would bother me all through my " experience . " Bright red , not blood red . <p> Star Trek : The Experience is n't something anyone should take too seriously , but being too ironic does n't work well either . Over the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either find endearing or off-putting . <p> The full article , including Julia 's attempt at bribing a Ferengi , can be found by following this link . <p> " Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy " fairly deftly dovetails two interesting story concepts . If you are looking for serious drama or action-adventure , this is not the episode for you . Taken as a light episode following a few weeks of heavier subjects , it works pretty well . <p> Yesterday , Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) attended a live chat at the official Star Trek Continuum . Though they have not yet put up a transcript , below you will find a summary of the most important things said in the chat . This includes a whole bunch of new info on ' Blink of an Eye ' , the episode in which Voyager will be visiting a planet in which civilisations rise and fall in a time period of just a few days . Take a look at the info from the chat : <p> The chat started a bit late , as Picardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye ' . When he arrived , he said the following : " I 'm sorry that I 'm still shooting . I 'm speaking with the first prostetic applied to my face that I 've ever had since starting Voyager . ( We 're doing this on the phone from his trailer ) " <p> The last shot of the day was shot in the corridor set , outside of sickbay . In the scene , Picardo is not in his Starfleet uniform , but rather ' undercover ' disguised as an alien . That is also why he was wearing he prosthetic nose/headpiece and a strange outfit . The shot also included Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) and Roxann Dawson ( B'Elanna Torres ) . <p> ' One Small Step ' , the Mars episode directed by Picardo , will air the 17th of November . <p> The Doctor and Deanna Troi will not meet in the upcoming episode ' Pathfinder ' . <p> Mania Reviews ' Tinker Tenor'Christian ( 6:10 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green at AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine has put up her review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Voyager comedy centered around the Doctor . In general , Green thought the episode to be enjoyable : <p> While this episode had a lot in common with some of the original Trek episodes where Kirk had to deceive aliens - " The Corbomite Maneuver , " " A Piece of the Action " - it was just as much fun as those classics . I especially liked the balance between the Doctor 's humiliation and that of the aliens ... he may have been caught with his pants down ( in a manner of speaking ) in front of a lot of the crew , but that very fact enabled him to live out a number of his daydreams in a way Walter Mitty never would have imagined . <p> Still , Green also spotted several downsides to the episode , as you can read in her full review , This also includes a synopsis of the episode . <p> UPN 's Star Trek : Voyager wrestles for ratings with a February episode guest-starring World Wrestling Federation champ The Rock . The story : Hunter/warrior aliens called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan ) and force her to battle a Pendari alien ( The Rock ) to entertain them . " The fighters will have sensors and targets on their bodies , " says Trek executive producer Rick Berman , " and when they make contact , there will be some very interesting fireworks . " The Rock ( real name Duane Johnson ) performs 225 nights a year and does n't get to watch much TV . So he 's not a huge Trekker - but his wife is . " She 's even more excited than I am . " In other Trek news : Paramount is putting finishing touches on another series , " dramatically different from the last two , " Berman says . It will premiere in fall 2000 or early 2001 . <p> Nice to see yet another confirmation of the WWF episode , plus some completely new plot information . It 's also interesting that Series V is apparently still on track - I wonder when we 'll finally be hearing something more about that . Thanks go out to Stidham for posting this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daydreams are funny , a little of them goes a long way and they really do start getting repetitive very quickly . And the toothless alien threat does n't help matters . I know this is a comedy , but it 's extremely difficult to take these aliens seriously -- these are the least threatening ET 's since TNG 's Pakleds . With obviously chubby and cherubic actors cast under the heavy makeups , these twinkly-eyed doofuses are just too human , and the combination of the comic predicament of the Doctor , the overly familiar premise and these overly cute aliens ultimately makes " Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy " too lightweight . <p> ' Armada ' Designer InterviewChristian ( 6:09 pm CST ) Over at the Strategy Planet , a new interview with Trey Watkins , lead designer on Activision 's ' Star Trek : Armada ' , has just gone up . Take a look at this short blurb from the interview , dealing with the difference between the Activision title and Interplay 's ' New Worlds ' game : <p> So , what are the differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Star Trek New Worlds does fall more inline with the RTS genre ; however , it is entirely ground based and uses units that have not existed in the Star Trek universe outside of their game . <p> Armada on the other hand is focused around space combat using the latest ships all of the players will recognize from the TV shows and movies . While we have developed new ships they are all to help fill out the sides with different strategic options and are heavily based on the existing art direction . <p> The full interview can be found here . Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for this . <p> In the full article , Christopher Allan Smith describes the film , and talks to people such as writer/director Tamara Hernandez . Also available is a set of photos from the premiere , showing Ryan , some of her co-stars from the film , and Voyager 's Executive Producer Brannon Braga , who accompanied Ryan to the premiere . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for this ! <p> You could say Interplay 's game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( It 's based on Task Force Games ' Starfleet Battles--a board game that has been evolving since its debut in 1979 . ) And any game system that 's weathered two decades years of poking and prodding by hard-core war gamers and devoted Trekkies is bound to have more complexity and balance than your average computer game . <p> So once you 've used the manual to learn to actually play the game , this guide can serve as a primer on how to play it well . The tips below will help you play better both against the computer and in multiplayer contests <p> TNG &amp; DS9 Companion CD-ROMs ShipChristian ( 6:07 pm CST ) Simon &amp; Shuster Interactive have announced that they 've just shipped the official CD-ROM companions to TNG and DS9 . Selling for no more than $19.95 , the CDs are excellent value for money , judging from the contents : <p> Every Script - For the first time ever , the scripts from every Star Trek : The Next Generation episode ( all 178 ) have been digitized and placed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every Episode - The Companion details each and every one of the 178 episodes for Star Trek : The Next Generation 's seven year run with original video trailers , hundreds of photos , behind the scenes stories and plot summaries . <p> One comprehensive resource - Exhaustively researched , Star Trek : The Next Generation Companion is the perfect momento of the series ' seven ground breaking seasons . A vital reference work no Star Trek : The Next Generation fan should be without . <p> Especially the fact that the CDs contain the full episode scripts is absolutely fantastic , even if it makes me wonder why I had to spend so much money on the Scriptbooks just a year ago .

' Arena ' is quite probably the title of the wrestling episode featuring Jeffrey Coombs and WWF Wrestler The Rock . 415Man 's original post can be found here . <p> The other Paramount insider on Usenet , Dangermouse , also just posted a few news items on the ' Voyager Conspiracy ' episode .

Kirk ) will be on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 's ' Life &amp; Times ' on November 2nd from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m . EST . ' Life &amp; Times ' is a show featuring the lives of famous Canadians , which Shatner of course also is . The official web site of the program has a bit more info on this . <p> " Survival Instinct " is a definite winner . I think I 'll put this in the upper ranks of three stars .

Here 's what he had to say about how they 're progressing : <p> Star Trek is coming along , almost done with all the level design . Then its content time . The revised Quake III engine is about done - obviously some tweaks and additions required , but we are 90% there with new technology I would judge . Our Glorious leader(tm) Brian Pelletier took a demo of Voyager to Activision recently , and then on to Paramount , so they could judge our work , and returned home covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing for a team to hear , to revitalise commitment and enthusiasm for the product . <p> A bit of info on the weapons in the game ( plus a request for input on that ) can be found by going here ! <p> " Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy " remained surprisingly flat from last week , earning Voyager 's second 4.7 rating , 7 share . I had expected some improvement , but as demonstrated last week by " Barge of the Dead , " an overnight at this level does n't neccessarily translate into final ratings doom . <p> Voyager finished in 6th in its timeslot , coming in just below 5th place " Roswell " which saw a huge dip from last week . The sci-fi/teen angst drama dropped from its 6.5/10 premiere to a 5.0/7 in its second week . As has usually been the case in past years , the baseball playoffs hurt Voyager by drawing its strong male audience . Fox won the slot and the night with a 12.4/20 from the American League Championship Series . <p> A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the full report . <p> This is the first new look folks have had at the game in a month , and the screenshots are real stunners . <p> Still , to be fair , the shots are looking more and more stunning each time , and I ca n't wait to play the actual game . According to the preview , that might actually happen rather soon , as a demo is set to be released sometime in November . The preview also has the news that in January , Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive will be strongly present at the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco . More can be found by following this link , which was sent to me by Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga . <p> Hello World !

Christian ( 5:34 pm CST ) Or , more accurately , ' re-launches ' ! Over at the Trek Nation , we 've just transformed the Comics Q&amp;A to a full-blown Trek comics site , featuring all you 'll ever want to know about Wildstorm 's upcoming Star Trek comics . For now , the site already contains a bulletin board ( which is already being visited by some of the writers for the comics ) and several interviews , while once Wildstorm actually starts publishing the comics ' Captain Jim ' Zimmerman will be writing reviews of them ! Most importantly , though , the site features a Q&amp;A Board where you can ask questions to Jeff Mariotte , Wildstorm 's editor in charge of the Star Trek line . To coincide with the relaunch of the comics site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , including the following two : <p> Query From : emily Hi ! I just saw your press release at the site ! As that is already three months old , I was thinking : do you have the titles and plots of anymore comics for us ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte At this point , I ca n't even remember which ones were in that release and which were n't . I 'm pretty sure that did n't include ST : VOY -- AVALON RISING , which is a kind of fairy tale/Camelot story involving the Doctor on a planet that closely resembles medieval Earth . It 's written by science fiction novelist Janine Ellen Young and comic book writer Doselle Young , with art by David Roach . Other announcements will be forthcoming as we get closer to publication . <p> Query From : Chris 1 ) Will any of the TNG comics take place on the Enterprise-E ? 2 ) What will come out next after Purchance to Dream ? 3 ) Will you be able to renew your Trek liscense in 2001 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Yes , we 're working on one right now set on the E -- it 's called ST:TNG -- THE KILLING SHADOWS , by Scott Ciencin. 2 ) Near the end of PERCHANCE TO DREAM there 'll be another one-shot , this one an original series story called ST : ALL OF ME . It 's written by Tony Isabella and Bob Ingersoll , with incredible art by Aaron Lopresti and Randy Emberlin. 3 ) That 's up to the business guys at DC and Paramount , not me . <p> To find the full update , in which Mariotte talks about some of the artists , the aliens from ' Perchance to Dream ' , Peter David , and many other topics , please visit our new Comics Site . While there , please also check out the comics bulletin board , where you can chat about everything related to Star Trek comics ! <p> Delta Blues Reviews ' Barge'Christian ( 5:33 pm CST ) Jim Wright at Delta Blues has upoaded his review of ' Barge of the Dead ' , last week 's Voyager episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analysis of the episode , which he ends as follows : <p> Verdict : I 'm giving it ( * * * * ) . It looked great , I enjoyed the pacing , and it made me think . <p> Some folks wonder how I come about my scores ; there 's no real science to it , but it boils down to this . If I hate it , one star . If I 'm disappointed , two stars . If I like it , three stars . If I love it , four stars . The half stars split the difference . <p> I liked last week 's episode , but it did n't have me jumping up and down . This episode did . <p> The full review ( which also contains an attempt at translating the Klingon spoken in the episode ) can be found here . Presumably that link will be clicked on by nearly everyone - judging from the current results of the TrekToday poll , Jim Wright is easily your most favourite reviewer . <p> ' Hidden Evil ' Chat TonightChristian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chat tonight for the upcoming adventure game ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil ' . Mike Webster , Associate Brand Manager from Activision will be on hand as well as at least one developer from the Hidden Evil team . The chat will start at 23:00 GMT ( 7pm EST - 3pm PST ) . The chat will be held on The Omega Project 's own IRC Server , which can be access by typing /server omegaproject.net in any IRC Client . The chat is being held on channel #hiddenevil . <p> THE BOTTOM LINE : Klingon Klaptrap in the Delta Quadrant proves to be a bit less eye-rolling than expected . While heavy recycling is in evidence ( think " The Inner Light " meets " Coda " ) , the episode does not foul up too horribly . CYNICS CORNER RATING : 7.5 <p> ' Alice ' Promo OnlineChristian ( 5:32 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions seems to have finally gotten back in full swing , as he has not only put up the ' Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy ' promo , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager episode . As is usual for Vidiot , the trailer is of a very high quality , and provides a good preview of next week 's episode . You can download the trailer via Vidiot himself , while there is also a TrekToday mirror available . <p> Despite some early indicators that this episode would perform poorly , " Barge of the Dead " earned a third strong rating for Voyager 's 6th season , tallying a 3.8 rating , 6 share . That 's down from last week 's 3.9/6 , but level with " Equinox , Part II . " The episode also rose from last season 's comparable episode , " Extreme Risk , " which grabbed a 3.6/6 . With that , the first three episodes this season have rose from their comparable episodes last season , something that has only been done once since TNG left the air . <p> In the full report , Greg talks about the influence of the new ' Roswell ' series on Voyager 's performance , and looks at the chances for ' Tinker , Tenor , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Local German TVChristian ( 5:32 pm CST ) DSi Weekly , the weekly Trek newsletter of the German Star Trek Index , has a report about a Star Trek parody which has started showing on local German television .

This week , he looks at the reasons for Trek 's focus on humans : <p> Recently , people have been raising a question as to why " Star Trek is human centered ?

Tomorrow ( Wednesday ) , he will be appearing on the Regis &amp; Kathie Lee Show , while on Thursday he 'll be on the morning news show of the Fox News Channel .

Take a look at how he starts his article : <p> This past week , " Star Trek : Voyager " gave us " Barge of the Dead , " a much-touted episode in which we get to see B'Elanna Torres do some Klingon heavy-lifting . Her mother , apparently condemned to the Klingon death barge , is discovered by Torres during a near-death experience , and the Starfleet engineer must struggle with herself -- but mostly with her shipmates --over whether or not she should welcome her violent Klingon side and accept the horror that the Klingon mythology about death and dishonor promises . Knowing what we do about Klingons , one would have to wonder why any sane person would want to be Klingon . More important , we have to wonder why " Trek " writers keep returning to this very un- " Trek " theme of an alien race that stands for every regressive tendency in life . <p> In the full feature , Zipperer examines the way the Klingons were developed in all the modern Trek series .

This 3D action shooter features stunning visuals , lots of heart stopping gunplay , and a number of great looking foes . You play a member of a special security team , and you have to stop enemy boarding parties , visit hostile planets , and infiltrate enemy bases . Elite Force looks like doing for Star Trek what Jedi Knight did for Star Wars , as it is an amazing looking action title with lots of atmosphere , superb weapon effects , and some incredibly realistic ( and interactive ) environments . <p> A more in-depth look at ' Voyager : Elite Force ' , plus previews of games such as ' Deep Space Nine : The Fallen ' , can be found in the full feature . <p> Highest UPN Thursday EverChristian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Thursday 's showing of ' WWF Smackdown !

What 's that all about ? In the game , the player engages enemies in a newly-designed Valkyrie class fighter ( based on Data 's ship from the last movie and as well as the Defiant . ) It did n't seem feasible that you would only meet traditional Star Trek ships like the Romulan Warbird or the Klingon Bird Of prey due to their size and power .

After Raven 's Jake Simpson first announced this in his . plan file , a minor storm erupted , with fans and even other Mac developers protesting against the lack of a Mac version . In the end , Raven did get a few machines from Apple , and now it looks like there will probably still be a Mac version of their Voyager game .

Elliot Cannon ( ' Myscha , ' Level Design Director ) . In the interview , they talk about such things as the game 's new animation system , the rendered station locations , and the new alien race , the Grigari : <p> The Grigari are basically a race of biomechanical scavengers .

Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that standard Federation weaponry has little or no effect on all but the weakest class of Grigari . So in the early missions where the player encounters this foe they will be forced to use stealth and their wits to get around this problem and still accomplish their mission goals in one piece . Later , once more effective weaponry is discovered the player will finally have the opportunity to face these creatures head on and take them out .... but there are still a few surprises beyond that ! <p> Was n't the upcoming ' Voyager : Elite Force ' game also going to include a Scavengers species ?

In the interview , he talks about the high realism of the game ( apparently you will be thrown into the brig if you shoot at the warp core , for instance ) , the environments you 'll be able to explore ( including space itself ) and the game 's special Artificial Intelligence : <p> What is the biggest code change from the Q3A engine to VOY:EF ? <p> I might be a bit biased here since this is something I 've been involved in programming , but I 'd have to say scripting and AI . Quake 3 had DM bots when we got it , but no traditional " monster " or NPC AI and , of course , no scripting . Josh Weier ( programmer ) and myself have developed the scripting and AI systems ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well for us . Those that have seen the game so far seem to be impressed . Our goal is to have intelligent squad and enemy AI and mix that with interactive scripted events that allow us to have enemies and NPCs behave in a huge variety of ways , even specific to every event , like Half-Life . But unlike Half-Life , you will be able to interact with the scripts and affect their outcome . If a guy is crawling on the ground and a medic goes to drag him to safety while enemies are shooting at them , you can do a variety of different things . You could wait and see what happens- if the medic is killed , the injured guy will sit there and be dogmeat , if the injured guy is killed , the medic will run to cover . If you shoot the enemy , the medic could successfully drag the injured man to cover and treat him then keep fighting . <p> More on this can be found in the full interview .

The actress took her concerns to Berman and Braga , stressing that she yearned for some flexibility in her schedule . She could handle long hours when she worked , but she coveted the occasional day off so she could be by Hagan 's side at some political reception if necessary or at her sons ' school for sporting events . In other words , Mulgrew wanted to reduce the frequency of times that she would be sitting at home for hours , unable to go anywhere or do anything , waiting for production to call her in . And she did n't want too many more instances in which she shot only a single , non-essential scene . <p> Berman and company heard Mulgrew out , and ultimately they came to an agreement that satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year or next . Just how close , though , did we come to losing Mulgrew ? " If they had said to me , ' We really do n't care , ' I may have considered leaving , " she responds . " I was under contract already for the sixth year and I intended to honor that contract . I 'm only talking about conversations and negotiations for the seventh season . It really involved my happiness quotient . In many ways , I set the tone on the set . My mood and my approach are very important , and I think there 's nothing worse than a professional actress who is unhappy because she misses her husband and children . But Berman and Braga realized that . And if I may say so , they were not only gentlemen about it , but very gracious . I am much , much happier now . " <p> The full interview can be found here . Thanks go out to TrekWeb for this . <p> Counsellor Tryhard 's baby I actually got this episode out on video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( coming any moment now , Wendy 's due date was two days ago ! ) but ended up gleaning this idea - we all know children grow up amazingly quickly in the Trek universe but this baby grew quickly even for their standards ! <p> Space.com Critiques ' Barge'Christian ( 5:19 pm CST ) And their reviewer Kenneth Silber certainly is not very positive about the episode . Here 's what he had to say in the analysis portion of his review : <p> Like its titular slow boat , the " Barge of the Dead " carries viewers into a half-baked mishmash of New Age religious sentiment and self-actualization flapdoodle.The Klingon netherworld jibes poorly with the complex but comprehensible universe that 's generally been posited in Star Trek . The barge and its destination are reminiscent of classical and Christian visions of the afterlife , reflecting a lack of scriptwriting imagination . <p> B'Elanna 's descent , in any event , turns out to be merely an opportunity for her to feel better about herself . No hard choices must be made . Eternal damnation lasts about 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silber 's take on dangling plot threads , inaccuracies and great quotable moments can be found by following this link . <p> More On ' Galaxy Ball'Christian ( 5:18 pm CST ) At the Continuum , Voyager 's Robert Beltran ( Chakotay ) just shared some more information on this year 's Galaxy Ball , which he will be hosting . The ball is organised to benefit the Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles , which Beltran is a supporter of . Here 's what attendees will be able to expect from the event , according to Beltran : <p> " I hope this will be an opportunity for people to have a lot of fun while participating in an event that will bring much needed help to so many people with Downs Syndrome . We 've put together an entertaining day and evening event and I hope people will come , enjoy themselves and perhaps even become more aware of what Downs Syndrome is and what they can do to help .

" <p> Canadian ' Free Enterprise ' ReviewChristian ( 5:18 pm CST ) Canadian entertainment news site Jam ! Showbiz has reprinted a ' Free Enterprise ' review by Liz Braun , which first appeared in the Toronto Sun . The independent comedy ' Free Enterprise ' has just started showing in a few places in Canada , and Braun strongly recommends seeing it : <p> A serial killer who only murders members of the Brady Bunch , a rap verison of Julius Caesar that stars William Shatner , an obsession with X-Men , the gestalt of Star Trek . If any of this means anything to you , Free Enterprise is a must-see proposition . Actually , even if it does n't mean anything to you ... ditto . <p> The full review also contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Update : I see they 've also put up a review of the film by Steve Tilley , writer for the Express .

" The play is set to open about two weeks from now , on the 21st of October . <p> SMPTAD To Honour ZimmermanChristian ( 5:18 pm CST ) The Society of Motion Picture and Television Art Directors ( SMPTAD ) has organised a special screening of ' Star Trek : First Contact , ' in order to honour the work of long-time Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman . The screening will take place on Sunday the 17th of October at the Directors Guild Theatre , 7920 Sunset Blvd , in Los Angeles . Take a look at why First Contact was chosen for this screening : <p> SMPTAD Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Contact " to Zimmerman for the special screening because it was one of the most widely watched " Star Trek " films . The story centers around the earth as opposed to being primarily concerned with outer space and aliens . <p> " This film , " Zimmerman explained , " is perfect for those who are not familiar with the premise of Star Trek ' and it offers a virgin audience the opportunity to appreciate the story . " " Star Trek " movies , television specials and series are seen over and over again worldwide . The two " Star Trek " series have reached an enormous worldwide audience due to their hit status in syndication . <p> A bit more on the event , including some info on the work of Zimmerman ( who unfortunately does n't work on Star Trek anymore ) , can be found in the full article . <p> Continuum ' The Fallen ' PreviewChristian ( 5:17 pm CST ) Over at the official Star Trek Continuum , a new preview of the upcoming action game ' DS9 : The Fallen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal that there will actually be a different campaign for each of the three officers you can play as : <p> Players can choose between three different campaigns that are dictated by their choice of character . The first person characters are Kira Nerys , Benjamin Sisko and Worf . The campaigns will be signifigantly different as each of the three characters will have dissimilar attributes that help or complicate the success of their mission . Worf is more aggressive in his approach , Kira more covert and Sisko 's strengths and weaknesses fall somewhere between the two . Making the play more realistic all the character voices are supplied by the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine actors Nana Visitor , Avery Brooks and Michael Dorn . <p> More , including all-new screenshots , info on the game 's new alien species , and some release date info , can be found in the full preview . <p> IGN Sci-Fi Reviews ' Barge'Christian ( 5:17 pm CST ) Blake Fischer at IGN Sci-Fi has uploaded his review of ' Barge of the Dead , ' the recent Klingon hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rating of 3 out of 5 , the same as the previous two episodes . Still , he did have a few words of preaise for ' Barge of the Dead ' : <p> Honestly , this is one of the most interesting episodes of Voyager in a long time , simply because of a Matrix-like quality of never knowing what 's really real that keeps the audience guessing . Surreal moments like Tuvok and B'Elanna 's spirited sparring clue the audience in , but when the reality shifts again we 're never quite sure if it 's the final jump . Dreams within dreams can be confusing but when they are done right they 're fun , and they 're done quite well here . Unfortunately , when she gets back to reality it 's disappointing , since the whole sequence is casually explained as visions from her coma . At that point , the episode becomes a bit more traditional and our interest wanes . <p> ' Barge Of The Dead ' Tube ReviewChristian ( 5:16 pm CST ) Eon Magazine spin-off Tube Reviews has put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday 's new Voyager episode . Awarding it just a C+ , reviewer Jeff Bond is n't exactly wildly enthusiastic about the episode : <p> The bottom line is that it was more interesting to see episodes like this made about Spock or Worf , characters who could n't give voice to their inner feelings . Torres gripes about her Klingon heritage constantly , so while " Barge of the Dead " does fill in some of her past , it does n't make her any more intriguing as a character . <p> Paramount has confirmed the hiring of a new writer , Robin Bernheim , on Star Trek Voyager . Rumors were rampant this week that the series had finally hired a female writer - the first woman on the staff since Lisa Klink departed along with former executive producer Jeri Taylor . Because she has considerable production experience , Bernheim is apparently expected to work as a production supervisor as well as on scripts . <p> The full edition of ' Hailing Frequencies , ' a summary of the most important Trek news of the last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek Stars In LOTRChristian ( 5:16 pm CST ) And how grateful I am for that , as it gives me a great excuse to do an update on what might well turn out to be the best movie series of all time .

They have also realised the official cast list , which turns out to include three Trek alumni , two of which are mentioned in the press release : <p> Brad Dourif <p> Voyager , Lon Suder stars as Wormtongue , the manipulative adviser to King Theodon and a pawn of the evil wizard Saruman . Since making his film debut in One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , ' ' for which he earned an Academy Award nomination , a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award , Dourif has appeared in over 40 films .

As was to be expected , Voyager 's latest and upcoming episode are actively talked about : <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:14 pm CST ) Thanks to my brother , today I got my first-ever Trek actor autograph ! Out of personal interest , he was attending the 50th Astronautical Congress Federation , and while the event itself did n't turn out to be that interesting , he did run across Jennifer Lien ( Kes ) who was being interviewed together with the Dutch astronaut-to-be Arnold Kuiper . After that , she was chatting with a few people when Thomas walked up to her and asked her for an autograph for me . Now I 'm the proud owner of a leaflet of the Dutch Star Trek fan club with on top of that the text ' To : Christian - Jennifer Lien . ' I 'm probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my computer , joining a charcoal painting of Picard and Riker and an autograph of Ira Steven Behr which Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga was kind enough to get for me at the DS9 finale premiere . That wall is really turning into a rather interesting little Trek shrine - I wonder what it 'll look like a few years from now . <p> B'Elanna Torres has a very bad trip , though the journey through hell was nothing compared to the bad hair day she was having . One has to keep a sense of humor about these things , right ? " Barge of the Dead " is the episode which reportedly caused writer Ron Moore to leave Voyager . Although none of us will ever see the original and we ca n't really compare scripts , I do wonder what went wrong . Despite some screamingly bad redundancies from previous Trek episodes and from movies like Flatliners about wanting to experience life after death - which all seemed built into the premise - " Barge of the Dead " played pretty well . It featured an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tim Russ ( I do love out-of-character Tuvok even if that happens too damn often ) , and a decent performance by Kate Mulgrew , even if she was playing the most annoying incarnation of Janeway we 've seen yet . <p> ' Animal Farm ' RatingsChristian ( 5:06 pm CST ) Ultimate TV is reporting that ' Animal Farm , ' the TNT telefilm starring Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) as the pig Napoleon and Kelsey Grammer ( Captain Morgan Batheson ) as his opponent Snowball , was seen by 16.1 million viewers and achieved a 7.3 rating .

Thanks go out to Vicky Carson for this ! <p> Kenneth Biller Chat ReportChristian ( 5:05 pm CST ) " What Kenneth Biller Chat ? " , you 're probably thinking . Well , yesterday at 7:30pm PDT the new sci-fi ' virtual community ' Cybertown hosted a live chat with Kenneth Biller , co-executive producer on ' Voyager . ' Unfortunately , they apparently did n't think it was necessary to announce that a few days in advance , and so I myself only learned about a few hours before it started . Though Biller did n't provide any shocking new info , here 's a short report on what he said in the chat : <p> Voyager 's budget is currently about $2 million per episode , making it one of the most expensive shows on television . <p> When asked if there was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YES .... I ca n't elaborate on the specifics . Maybe Jan 2001 . " This might be the first time someone involved with Trek has officially mentioned a possible date , though I 'm certainly not sure about this . <p> Biller is currently developing a non-SF show for another network . <p> There will probably be no Doctor/Seven of Nine romance this year , though Janeway will have ' an unusual romance ' this season . ( Probably referring to the episode ' Safe Harbour , ' where Janeway will apparently fall in love with an Irish barkeeper on the holodeck . <p> Today Cybertown will be hosting a chat with someone else involved with Voyager - Rob LaBelle . Apparently , he 's appeared twice on the show , once as a ' Talaxian Prisoner ' in ' Faces , ' and once as as ' Kafar ' in ' False Profits . ' Should , for some reason , you have the desire to ask LaBelle any questions about his Voyager roles , you will be able to attend the chat in the ' vDrome Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spy ' PromoChristian ( 5:05 pm CST ) SCIFI Headquarters has just put up the promo trailer for ' Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy , ' next week 's new Voyager episode . Judging from the trailer , this is going to be one of the strangest shows Voyager has ever done , but perhaps also one of the funniest . As usual , the trailer is available as a 24 fps MPG-file , 3.5 MB in size . You can download the promo here . ( Yes , I was actually planning to mirror the file again , but time constraints prevented me from doing that this week . Sorry ! ) <p> " Barge of the Dead " was hurt more than I had anticipated by the premiere of the WB 's " Roswell , " taking a 15 percent hit from last week , falling to a 4.7 rating , 7 share . That 's down from last week , last year 's average , and " Extreme Risk , " the comparable episode from last year . <p> That performance places Voyager in a very distant 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s 6.5/10 and 4th place CBS 's 6.6/10 . " Seven Days " fell back down to its usual minimal performance , only tallying a 3.4/5 . " Seven Days " earned the only overnight lower than Voyager 's for Wednesday as a whole . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:04 pm CST ) No ' Trek BBS Today , ' ' Today On TV ' or ' Poll Results ' today , unfortunately , due to a severe lack of time on my side . There also wo n't be as many news as usual , probably - I 'll make up for that tomorrow again . <p> Wednesday October 6 , 1999 <p> New Episode ' Blink Of An Eye'Christian ( 6:11 pm CST ) NOTE : Below you will find spoilers for ' Blink of an Eye , ' a new Voyager episode scheduled to start filming next week .

In it , he talks about the somewhat awkward design of the new edition , consisting of the ' old ' data from the 1997 hardcover edition and an added supplement . Here 's a short quote from Okuda 's post : <p> Reducing the price was a major driving force behind the 1999 edition . The original plan was for the low-cost trade paperback edition only , which was a straight reprint of the color hardcover edition . ( The hardcover was only added at the request of some of the chain bookstores . For anyone on a budget , we strongly urge them to consider the trade paperback edition . ) <p> By keeping the original 1997 page layouts unchanged , Pocket 's production costs for the new edition were dramatically lower , bringing the cost of the book down quite a bit for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which the book business works , it turns out that adding a small number of additional pages brought the price down even further .

Apparently , the setting of ' Andromeda ' will be all six galaxies in our local cluster , populated by alien species such as the Vedra , the Madogh and the Than . Kevin Sorbo 's character , captain of the Andromeda Ascendant , will be human . A full report on Wolfe 's Usenet postings can be found in our special background article , containing practically all which is currently known about Andromeda 's storyline . <p> This background article also contains an exclusive mini-interview , in which Wolfe reveals several very intriguing parts of the series , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first officer and ... his ship ! To read the full interview , please go check out the full article - I promise you wo n't regret it ! <p> In his newsgroup on the official Continuum , Voyager 's Production Designer Rick Sternbach has posted the following : <p> " One Small Step " looks like it 'll be a keeper . We got to design a complete Mars orbiter ship inside and out , right down to the null-g handrails . Ca n't tell you any more ( wink-wink , nudge-nudge ) , but we 've seen a first pass minus visual effects and music , and I 'm excited . On the techy side , the ship does n't jibe with NASA 's current plans for a crewed Mars mission ( which does n't include an orbiter as such ) , but enough mission studies over the last fifty years have been done to allow us to cobble one together .

Made my day , as you might imagine ! <p> ' Sexual Generations ' Trek BookChristian ( 5:15 pm CST ) This title really has n't been getting any press at all . Apparently , last month the University of Illinois Press published a new non-fiction book by Robin Roberts , entitled ' Sexual Generations : ' Star Trek , the Next Generation ' and Gender . ' Unfortunately I do n't know what precisely the book deals with in its 224 pages , but if I were to guess I 'd say it probably deals with how Star Trek has been depicting women over the past few decades .

Thanks go out to Locus for this . <p> ' Know Your Role'Christian ( 5:14 pm CST ) Which , I 'm informed , is apparently one of The Rock 's famous phrases . I know this must be beginning to be awfully boring for you , but we 've got yet another confirmation and additional bit of info on the upcoming Voyager wrestling episode , for which a title is still not known . ShowStoppas , a ' pro wrestling news site , ' has posted a report of an online web chat which WWF wrestler The Rock attended , organised by the UK online tabloid Megastar . Two items he mentioned in the chat were of special interest for Trek fans : <p> When asked if the people 's eyebrow is insured , The Rock informs us that it is not as the people 's eyebrow is owned by the people . <p> The Rock is serious about acting . He is going to be a vulcan on Star Trek and will have a cameo role in the movie " Jack Of All Trades " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report about this , had the following to add to this : " One of The Rock 's trademark things is the raising of his right eyebrow , a la Mr. Spock . If The Rock indeed becomes a Vulcan , someone on the Voyager staff is definitely a wrestling fan , because it 's perfect casting in that regard . : ) " Thanks also go out to the Wrestling Arena for this news item . <p> UPN SCAM OF THE WEEK : The preview of this week 's show featured a scene with Seven of Nine saying " I will return to the Borg , " a scene which obviously did n't appear here , but was apparently culled from another episode ( " The Raven ? " " Dark Frontier ? " ) . It 's nothing compared to UPN 's ongoing scam of pretending to run a national television network , but I thought it was worth mentioning . <p> In the full review Sluss still deems the episode worthy of receiving an 8.0 , which is a full point more than ' Equinox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> If I did n't know better I 'd almost say the official Continuum has also joined the spoiler business .

' Here 's a short quote from the article : <p> When we asked Robert Picardo ( " The Doctor " Star Trek : Voyager ) about the upcoming episode " Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy " he was very enthusiastic , calling it the most successful Star Trek : Voyager comedy to date . " I 'm completely delighted with how it turned out . To my knowledge it 's the only Star Trek : Voyager episode directed by an Academy Award winner ! " Episode director John Bruno won an Oscar award for his work as Visual Effects Supervisor on " The Abyss " in 1989 . He has also been nominated seven times since 1985 in the same category . <p> A bit more can be found in the full report , which also contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continuum on Thursday the 14th of October . <p> Famke Janssen Talks X-MenChristian ( 5:12 pm CST ) Cinescape has just put up a short mini-interview with Famke Janssen , who guest-starred on the TNG episode ' Perfect Mate ' and will now be appearing opposite Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) in the upcoming ' X-Men ' film . <p> We are going to attempt that Q3A and Star Trek models be interchangeable and compatable between each program . That is to say when it comes to multiplayer deathmatch there should n't be a problem . Single player is a different matter altogether and Voyager will require many additional animations from Q3A models . <p> The original message on this can be found here . Thanks go out to Blue for the link . In other news , they also announced that Paramount reacted very favourably after being shown the current version of the game : <p> We just had a " green light meeting " with Activision which is basically a check up and a go-ahead approval thing . Our project lead Brian Pelletier was in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Paramount to demo the game . Here is what Brian P. had to say ... " Went to Paramount and they loved the demo and said it was the best Trek game they 've ever seen . They even went and got their bosses so I could demo it to them . " <p> In the full thread , you 'll also be able to find a few words from Paramount 's Harry Lang on being shown the game . <p> Happy Birthday ! Christian ( 5:11 pm CST ) Today is the 47th birthday of Duncan Regehr , who appeared on DS9 several times as the Bajoran First Minister Shakaar . It 's also the birthday of my father , who , even though he is not at all a Star Trek fan , still visits the site almost every day . Happy birthday , dad : - ) ! <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:08 pm CST ) The spam I get is getting weirder and weirder . For some reason , I appear to have been added to the spam list of a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of most annoying spams ever - what in heaven 's name am I supposed to do when I get a mail informing me that ' Tietokeskuksestamme voit nyt ostaa E-postiluettelon , ' and telling me to ' sisSltSS 50.000 sekS yksityishenkiliden ettS yritysten osoitetta Suomessa ?

That includes four major articles : Voyager 's ratings success , news that some Next Generation stars will be showing up on Voyager soon ( good luck avoiding this spoiler , it was announced more than two months in advance ) , the unveiling of the Star Trek postage stamp , and news that David Gerrold is once again battling for his intellectual property rights .

This week , he looks at the interesting questions why we are very fond of some ' Alien Species of the Week , ' and simply forget others : <p> Throughout the history of Star Trek , different types of aliens and lifeforms have made their way into our imaginations . Yet , there are several which can be remembered in a flash ... with others fading into an existence laced with reruns and syndication . What makes a quality alien ? Let 's review this concept for a moment . <p> Those popular aliens we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics that we fell in love with . Although there are the popular ones , such as the Romulans , Cardassians , and Borg , there are many more we have only seen once or twice yet have an attachment to . For example , who could forget the Mudd Androids , the Gorn , the Tholians , or the Andorians ? <p> Voyager VHS Release DateChristian ( 4:46 pm CST ) According to Amazon.com , Paramount Home Video will start releasing Voyager episodes on video starting the 1st of Janurary , 2000 . If the info Amazon has is correct , at this date all the episodes from the first three Voyager seasons will be released at the same time , at an official price of $14.95 per tape carrying just one episode . A sample Amazon page for ' Caretaker ' can be found here - it contains info on the video 's format and such things . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for this . <p> Jeri Ryan ' Politically Incorrect ' ImagesChristian ( 4:46 pm CST ) The official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) on the ' Politically Incorrect ' show . Most shots show Ryan sitting next to violinist Joshua Bell , and Seven of Nine fans will certainly want to take a look . You can find the screencaps here . <p> Shatner On Video Watchdog CoverChristian ( 4:46 pm CST ) The official William Shatner Connection is reporting that the September issue ( #53 ) of Video Watchdog features William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) on the cover . The reason is that the magazine features an interview with Anthony M. Taylor , the producer of the Esperanto feature film ' Incubus , ' starring Shatner . The film was recently rediscovered , and to celebrate that Watchdog has two new feature articles on the game . A copy of the cover can be found here . <p> The script jumps effectively between the light and serious moments . The scene with Tom and Harry in Janeway 's ready room was nicely amusing--she chews them out for getting in a fight , but she does n't moralize on them . Standard discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you for fighting , but kudos on winning . She managed to dress them down and cheer them up in one fell swoop . <p> I liked all the performances , the guest stars included . I liked the writing . I thought the direction worked fine . It was a thoroughly watchable hour of television . <p> The full review , in which the episode is awarded 3.5 out of 4 stars , can be found here . <p> Feist Interviews George TakeiChristian ( 4:45 pm CST ) Feist News Net , a news site for Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas , has just put up a new interview with George Takei , who starred on the Original Series as Hikaru Sulu . As was to be expected , most of the interview deals with Takei 's campaign for more ethnic minorities on television : <p> " ... when the four top networks : NBC , CBS , ABC and FOX announced their slate of new programs for this fall 26 new shows we found that all the leads and all the actors where white . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outright lie . We 're clearly a multi-ethnic , multi-racial , multi-cultural nation -- and the message that 's being sent by that kind of programming is that we are a white nation . And this feeds directly into the delusions of white racists . <p> And , speaking exclusively from an Asian-American standpoint , no matter how many generations Asians have been here , we 're still seen as **28;457;TOOLONG foreigners . I 've been complimented frequently on how well I speak English , as if it were an acquired language . So there 's that perception , and when television paints this picture of America as a white nation it just underscores the ' otherness ' of Asian Americans and all minorities . <p> The full interview , conducted by Lisa A. Sillaway-Henshall , can be found here . <p> Fantastic UPN Thursday PerformanceChristian ( 4:45 pm CST ) Things are looking better and better for UPN - UltimateTV is reporting that their latest ' WWF Smackdown ! ' showing actually put them into the position of most watched network among Teens , with a 4/7 rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored a 3.9/12 , making them the second most watched network in that important category , right after NBC . Besides ' WWF Smackdown ! ' , the premiere of their new sitcom ' Shasta McNasty ' also contributed to the high Thursday night ratings , being the highest UPN comedy premiere since ' Dilbert ' last year .

' 163809 @qwx573809 <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 4:44 pm CST ) I 'm sure most of you will have noticed the glorious non-appearance of the ad banners at the top of TrekToday , and the other Trek Nation sites , over the past few days . The reason for this is that UGO , the firm responsible for serving our banners , has been having recurring problems with the software it uses to run its ad servers . They 're currently working on the problem , and hope to have the situation resolved as soon as possible ( some banners are even running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ( have ) cause(d) . <p> Holly Kim Wilson , who , besides reporting on all things Cardassian , is now also moonlighting as Vorta correspondent , just sent in the news that Jeffrey Combs ( Weyoun , Brunt ) will be filming an episode of Voyager this coming week . This was announced by Catherine Clay , co-president of the Official Jeffrey Combs Fan Club , who also provided the following plot and character info : <p> It seems that Jeff will be playing Penk , " an alien owner of gladiators who sees 7 of 9 as his newest champion in the ring . " <p> Considering the episode ( for which a title is not yet known ) is scheduled to start filming on Tuesday the 5th , this would seem to confirm the recent report that WWF wrestler ' The Rock ' will soon be filming a Voyager episode - presumably this is the same episode . Major thanks go out to both Holly Kim Wilson and Catherine Clay for this ! <p> Free Chapter ' Computers Of Trek'Christian ( 4:58 pm CST ) Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming hardcover book ' The Computers of Star Trek , ' sends along word that they 've put up for free the first chapter of their book ! The first chapter looks at the relationship between real-life computers and Trek , and the general mistrust of the Original Series against computers , and provides a rather interesting taster of what 's to come in the full book . You can find the preview via this page , while you can already pre-order the book here . <p> New Voyager Staff WriterChristian ( 4:58 pm CST ) Steve Krutzler at TrekWeb is reporting that Brannon Braga has just hired a new writer for his ' Voyager ' writing staff . A few months ago , Braga already added Robert Doherty to his staff , following Ronald D. Moore 's departure . Take a look at what TrekWeb has to say : <p> TrekWeb has learned that the new Voyager staffer is named Robin Burnheim . Also , her position is not officially as a " writer , " but something along the lines of " production supervisor " or " supervising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles other than " staff writer " . Bryan Fuller is a " story editor " for instance , but is nevertheless a " writer " for the show . <p> ... <p> Robin is a professional writer who has worked with Hans Beimler ( writer/co-executive producer , Deep Space Nine ) and has many scripts under her belt . She successfully pitched and sold a story to Voyager and then got the script assignment . Supposedly " she nailed the scipt perfectly " and was hired . <p> A bit more can be found in the full report , which also speculates that the new writer was added after pressure to bring a female staff member onboard , and to fight recent production problems . <p> Great Link Producer InterviewsChristian ( 4:58 pm CST ) NOTE : Below you will find spoilers for the upcoming episode ' The Voyager Conspiracy , ' both from the Great Link and a new bit of info which was submitted to TrekToday . As cool as the info is , you still might want to avoid the spoilers - click here to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprinted two interviews with the current men in charge of creating Star Trek , Rick Berman and Brannon Braga . Unfortunately the Rick Berman interview , which first appeared in Starburst magazine and was written by Grant Barber , is n't all that interesting , as it mostly consists of Rick Berman not saying anything about Series V or Trek X. <p> More informative is the interview with Voyager 's Executive Producer Brannon Braga , as he provides very detailed spoilers about the first ten or so episodes of Voyager 's sixth season . I wish I could have quoted all of that info , but I 'll just limit myself to the intrigueing episode ' The Voyager Conspiracy , ' as I 've also got some news of my own on that : <p> " We have a story in development in which Seven of Nine unravels a Delta Quadrant-wide conspiracy with Voyager right in the centre of it : that maybe Voyager 's arrival here was n't an accident , and maybe , just maybe , there is a conspiracy that extends from the Federation all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager Conspiracy . ' That 's a show we 're planning . " <p> Related to this , I just received a very short set report from someone about ' The Voyager Conspiracy . ' Apparently , the episode involves Caretaker technology , and from what this person saw , ' the array was not completely destroyed . ' Major thanks go out to the person who sent this in ! If you 're him , could you perhaps send me a mail ? The address you entered appears to be bouncing at the moment . <p> GamesFirst Reviews ' Starfleet Command'Christian ( 4:57 pm CST ) Strangely enough as one of the last sites to do so , GamesFirst ! has put up a review of Interplay 's new real-time strategy game ' Starfleet Command . ' Awarding it the full five out of five stars , reviewer Derek Meyer was especially impressed by the game 's multiplayer capabilities : <p> The multiplayer game really shines . Up to 6 players can compete in free-for-all skirmishes or team play , in various types of scenarios . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a frigate of his chosen race , and once destroyed , returns in the next larger ship class , up to dreadnoughts , and the battle continues until only one player remains . The games play fast , too a one-on-one duel rarely lasts more than 10 minutes ( unless there 's a Romulan with a cloaking device ) , so the action is quick and intense . With different terrain options and battlefield sizes to choose from , coupled with the vast array of ships and races , no two battles are ever exactly the same . The game is extremely smooth and stable on a LAN , and Internet play works well too . SFC cries out to be played head to head , and anyone who ignores this will miss a huge opportunity to have a load of fun with their friends . <p> StarTrek.Com ' Destination : Earth ' SweepstakesChristian ( 4:57 pm CST ) The official Star Trek Continuum has very sympatheticall launched a new Voyager sweepstakes , called ' Destination : Earth . ' In it , you will be able to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and Egypt , or prizes such as a copy of the ' Insurrection : Hidden Evil ' game , a copy of the ' New Worlds , New Civilizations ' book or a subscription to the Star Trek Communicator . All you have to do is fill out your personal info , and you will be automatically included in the drawing . Oh , and using the Continuum 's broad definition of ' Destination : Earth , ' you will also have to be American : - ( . You can enter in the sweepstakes here . <p> ' Mystery , Alaska ' ReviewChristian ( 4:57 pm CST ) TV Guide has put up a pretty negative review of ' Mystery , Alaska , ' the new independent film starring Colm Meaney ( Miles O'Brien ) . In a rather short review , Maitland McDonagh questions the motives behind the film : <p> Jamaican bobsledders , punk boxers , mongrel horses , impoverished go-cart racers ... How our hearts pound when these underdogs go up against corporate-backed competitors with all the advantages , and , through sheer force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about winning or losing ; it 's all about heart . That , at least , is the cynical thinking behind this thoroughly artificial bit of inspirational hogwash , in which a gang of backwater Alaskan hockey players get to take on the New York Rangers . <p> More can be found in the full review , where the film is awarded 2 out of 5 stars . <p> ' Dominion Wars ' InfoChristian ( 4:57 pm CST ) Trek gaming news site Federation HQ has reprinted a short blurb from this month 's ' Computer Games ' magazine , telling us all about the new ' Dominion Wars ' game being developed for Simon &amp; Schuster . Take a look : <p> Dominion Wars is a real-time game of tactical combat based on the DS9 storyline . The project is being developed by Gizmo industries , a newcomer that features a number of staff members with roots in the game business . ( most are Activision alumni . ) President Gary Wagner describes Dominion wars as " a tactical stragety game " . a little bit like Myth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game focuses on the basics . The player will control upto six different ships from any of the four races ( Federation , Klingon , Cardassian , Jem Hadar. ) in real time combat . <p> Players will be able to " purchase " a range of different ships and Captains through the use of a point system and engage in single player and multiplayer battles . <p> According to Federation HQ , the game is currently rumoured to be scheduled for a 4th Quarter 2000 release . <p> Space.com Reviews ' Survival Instinct'Christian ( 4:56 pm CST ) Kenneth Silber at Space.com , which seems to be featured more and more in TrekToday these days , has put up a review of ' Survival Instinct , ' last week 's new Voyager episode . The review is divided into several parts , including ' Quotable Moments , ' ' What Happened ' and ' Dangling Plot Threads , ' and also contains the following analysis : <p> A reasoned individuality is better than mindless adherence to the dictates of a collective . This is the basic lesson of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's getting a bit threadbare through repetition . <p> " Survival Instinct , " fortunately , maintains some freshness by complicating the issue : The ex-drones pay a high price for their regained autonomy in sharply curtailed life span . Moreover , they remain ambiguous characters throughout , deserving of help but not particularly likeable . The episode is notable also for its moody atmospherics , particularly in the flashback scenes . <p> More Great Link InterviewsChristian ( 4:56 pm CST ) Besides the aforementioned producer , the Great Link has also transcribed three more interviews , all of which dealing in some part with Voyager . Most interesting is probably the Foundation Imaging interview , which does n't contain any spoilers but talks extensively about the work the effects company has done on Voyager episodes such as ' Timeless ' and ' Scorpion . ' You can find that interview here . <p> Also spoiler-less is the Kate Mulgrew interview , in which the actress who portrays Janeway talks about such diverse topics as Brannon Braga , Jennifer Lien 's depature , and some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Roxann Dawson , which , as is of course almost unavoidable , has her talking about next week 's Klingon episode ' Barge of the Dead . ' Besides that , though , it also contains info on her directorial debut ' Riddles , ' the Paris-Torres relationship , and Voyager going home . <p> Gerrold Sues ParamountChristian ( 4:55 pm CST ) Again . In yet another chapter of his already infamous series of complaints to Paramounts about his creation the Tribbles , a new article in the Los Angeles Times contains the intertesting news that David Gerrold has just sued Paramount Pictures : <p> As " Star Trek " became a cultural phenom , " The Trouble With Tribbles " won its place among the most popular episodes . Even now , 32 years later , people ca n't seem to get enough of the toys--Talking Tribbles , Tribbles in a Jar , even a Tribble handbook . <p> Where 's all that merchandising money going ? Gerrold has filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court to find out . His suit against Paramount and Norway Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the rights to " Star Trek , " claims that they 've breached a contract that gave him 5% of the take . Gerrold is alleging fraud and asks for an accounting . He claims that the defendants " have repeatedly withheld information and other times lied " about what little moneymakers Tribbles have become . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 4:55 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , British Sky One will be showing Voyager 's ' Revulsion ' tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST . At 20:00 , they 'll be showing the new Deep Space Nine episode ' Afterimage . ' <p> -Tomorrow in Germany , Sat.1 will be showing DS9 's ' Wiedervereinigt ' ( Rejoined ) at 15:00 CET . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 4:54 pm CST ) Has anyone else noticed how quickly weekends seem to fly by ? When it started , I was intending to do lots of things - answer my backlog of email , talk to a few people I had n't seen in a while , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done nearly none of that . Let 's hope I 'll have some more discipline next week . <p> Overall , action fans will hate this episode because there is none . People who do n't like Seven ( all two of them ) will also hate this episode because it deals primarily with her ( in fact , almost all other characters have little more than cameo appearances ) . " Survival Instinct " has all the qualities of a filler episode with just enough depth to dole out some backstory . <p> The full review , in which the episode is awarded 3 out of 5 stars , can be found by following this link . <p> More On Robert Beltran BallChristian ( 5:29 pm CST ) The official Star Trek Continuum has published an update about the second annual Galaxy Ball , being hosted on the 30th of October by Robert Beltran ( Chakotay ) to benefit the Down Syndrome Association . The event will take place at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel , and should feature most of Beltran 's Voyager colleagues : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Q&amp;A and autograph session with the cast . The daylong event will resume in the evening with a silent auction , buffet dinner , a stand-up comedy routine by Ethan Phillips and vocal performances by Beltran , McNeil and Russ . The evening will close with music provided by Beltran 's brother Louie Cruz and his band The West Coast Players . <p> Ordover AnswersChristian ( 5:27 pm CST ) Editor John Ordover has once again updated his Q&amp;A Board , answering questions from Trek novel readers . Take a look at two of the most interesting answers : <p> Query from : William I was wondering , did you all mean the to put Beverly on the cover of ST:TNG novel " The First Virture " instead of Jack , or did the artist just make a mistake ? <p> Response from : John Ordover We meant to . She had to turn up -somewhere- on a Double Helix cover , and since the covers are done quite a while before the book is finished , we did n't know that her part in DH6 would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just saw some of he best cover art I 've ever seen for Trek books !

Does it involve any aliens that we 've seen before . A couple of other questions : 3 . Can you tell us anything about your plans for " the gang from AR-558 " ? 4 .

Thank you . <p> Response from : John Ordover 1 . ) Yes and no 2 ) yes and no 3 ) they are Marco 's plans 4 ) Yes <p> Brannon Braga Chat TranscriptChristian ( 5:27 pm CST ) The Continuum has posted its official transcript of the chat with Voyager Executive Producer Brannon Braga , which took place last week Thursday . Take a look at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a typical day for you ? <p> Brannon Braga : I 'll give today as an example . I spent the morning writing a script that is currently being filmed which creates a lot of pressure because I know I have to get it done quickly . I also had a story meeting on an upcoming episode with the writing staff and am currently discussing an upcoming episode that has a lot of problems and is going to take a great deal of effort to fix . At any given time , we are working on several episodes at once . Shows in post production , production and preproduction . It makes for a very hectic day . <p> Mooger asks : You seem to write with a lot of the " fall back " gimmicks -- time travel , alternate realities , dreams and such over and over , is this an interest of yours ? <p> Brannon Braga : It 's a testament to the popularity of science fiction that time travel and alternate realities would be considered a cliche . There was a time when these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just getting old . <p> Johnny asks : How do you keep away from nosy pests like us ? : ) <p> Brannon Braga : To be honest , we really do appreciate the fans of this show . If they 're nosy it 's only because they care . Better an obsessive interest than no interest at all . <p> No ' Star Trek Fans ' UpdatesChristian ( 5:27 pm CST ) You may have noticed that About.com 's Star Trek Fans , maintained by Julia Houston , has n't been updated for a while . In the latest edition of her ' Hailing Frequencies ' newsletter , she included the following explanation , which I 'm passing on to you here at Julia 's request : <p> About.com periodically has to upgrade the server and fix up the uploading system for over 700 sites . They 're doing such a thing now , and it will all be better when it 's over , but right now I 'm unable to touch my site , and have been unable to do so since Tuesday evening . Of *course* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun and I might get some new visitors . : : grumble : : Can you say , " Hey , this site has n't been updated in forever so I 'm never coming back here " ? <p> I 'll be back early next week with updates and reviews and fun and stuff , but at the end of the week I 'm going to look even more like a bum , because I 'm going to be in Vegas at the About.com convention . I 'll be " meeting the public " at this thing called The Red Ball , going to seminars on how to get the most out of my site , sneaking over with the *Star Wars* Guide to *Star Trek : The Experience , * and getting a decent picture of myself taken to replace that " I 'm sneering at you " picture I have up at the site now . <p> New Radio Trek ShowChristian ( 5:22 pm CST ) I just noticed at the German Star Trek Index ( who apparently also just jumped on the German daily news bandwagon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ' Das EpisodencafT .

' The set , which will ship on the 17th of Novermber , chronicles the latest three seasons of the fourth Star Trek series , and Fleet/Skybox say it 's going to be well worth getting : <p> " This 90-card base set showcases dramatic clips of scenes from the lst three seasons , " said Steve Dublin , product director for Fleer/SkyBox . " We 're excited to offer fans the most comprehensive synopsis of the last three years of Voyager , including fascinating subset cards which highlight special features of the show .

" <p> More information on the set 's bonus subsets ( including a Captain Proton set and a set featuring hand-signed cast autographs ) can be found in the full preview . <p> Two Continuum Background ArticlesChristian ( 5:21 pm CST ) The official Continuum has put up two new background articles dealing with recent Trek-related happenings . The first one , which apparently already appeared a few days ago , talks about two recently released non-fiction products : the Star Trek Sticker Book and the updated Encylopedia . Here 's what the article has to say about the Sticker Book : <p> The Star Trek Sticker Book offers an amazing collection of stickers from the Star Trek universe . Stickers of weapons , starships , emblems , flags , door signs and panel labels fill the book 's pages . Long time Star Trek aficionado Guy Vardaman was very impressed by the book . " It 's fantastic , I think children at heart of all ages will love this beautiful book . My favorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit on my cell phone and palm pilot . " There are even stickers of the Starship Enterprise , U.S.S. Voyager and the U.S.S. Defiant as well as many of the shuttlecraft that were designed for the four series . <p> This actually sounds rather fun , even when the $20 price is a bit high . More on this can be found in the full article . Also available is a short article looking at ' Animal Farm , ' the TNT adaptation set to premiere tomorrow . Two of the main stars of this adaptation are Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) and Kelsey Grammer ( Captain Morgan Bateson ) , both playing pigs .

Christian ( 5:20 pm CST ) Today would have been the 49th birthday of Persis Khambatta , who starred as the Deltan Lieutenant Ilia in ' Star Trek : The Motion Picture ' , had she not tragically passed away last year due to a heart attack . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 5:20 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Invasive Procedures ' tomorrow at 16:00 BST , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Day of Honour . ' At 18:45 , BBC Two will be showing Voyager 's ' Living Witness . ' <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:19 pm CST ) Why do I always notice such things after they actually happened ? Yesterday 's news post about the German Corona Newsletter was actually the 3000th story to appear on TrekToday since the site opened back in February ! <p> Friday October 1 , 1999 <p> Iconfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artist at the Iconfactory , has just finished the first installment in a four part series of Trek icons . This first installment includes no less than 21 freeware icons showing the characters from the Original Series , which really are looking incredibly good . You can download the icons via the Iconfactory Showroom - the only catch is that you will have to own a Mac , which is why I have n't yet downloaded them . Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for this . <p> Jeri Ryan On ' Politically Incorrect'Christian ( 6:09 pm CST ) Tonight on ABC , Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) will be appearing on the ' Politically Incorrect ' show , hosted by Bill Maher . Thanks go out to Richard Rafter for reminding me of this . <p> Digital Streams TOS Update ArticleChristian ( 6:06 pm CST ) Glen at Ai n't It Cool News has posted an article on the attempts by Digital Stream to produce a ' Special Edition ' of the Original Star Trek series . As we already reported here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new version of the classic episode ' The Doomsday Machine , ' in an effort to convince Paramount to produce more such enhanced episodes . To help their cause , they put up MPEG-clips of the new scenes on the internet , most of them showing external shots of the Enterprise , the Doomsday Machine and the Constellation . Now , AICN 's Glen has apparently seen the full updated episode , and provides us with his thoughts on it : <p> I 'm not going to go into many specifics here -- as much of Digital Stream 's you can see much of Digital Stream 's work on their web site for yourself . The Enterprise is rendered with more surface detail and nuance than before , giving the ship a more utilitarian ( if less elegant ) feel than previously . There was something about the sweep and simplicity of the ship ( as it originally appeared in the series ) which was dramatic and sublime , elements which appear to have been diminished by making the vessel look more functional . Also , artist embellishments -- like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back Enterprise 's saucer section burn with brightly with red / orange thruster fire and exhaust -- seem awkward and discontinuous within the Star Trek universe . Changes like these may look better to some eyes , but such augmentations have little or no grounding in either Trek lore , or the films &amp; series which follow the original show . <p> Glen then goes on with a very in-depth article talking about the actual enhancements , the implications this has for the future , and if the Original Series should actually be updated . You can find the full article here , or the Digital Stream samples here . <p> Corona Goes DailyChristian ( 5:50 pm CST ) Sebastian Lorenz at the German Corona Newsletter sends along word that , starting today , Corona will be joining the daily Trek news business . With over 8,600 readers , the monthly newsletter is already the biggest in Europe , but with the daily updated site German Trek fans will be even better able to find all the Trek news they want . Starting today , you will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - do n't forget to keep visiting TrekToday , though ; - ) . <p> Voyager To RockChristian ( 5:40 pm CST ) The official Worldwide Wrestling Federation has just announced ( again ) that WWF wrestlers will soon be making an appearance on ' Star Trek : Voyager . ' In the weekend news edition of the online WWF news show ( wittily called ' WWF News ' ) , news reporter Lucas had the following to say : <p> Hey everybody , this is Lucas , and welcome to WWF news for the first day of October . We just got word that Rock is gon na be appearing on ' Star Trek : Voyager . ' And the People 's Champion is gon na be taping the episode October 13th and 14th , but it 's not going to be airing until early next year . <p> ' The Rock , ' in case you were wondering , does not actually refer to the Planet Hell set , but instead to a man named Duane Johnson , Recent highlights in the career of the " People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I quote , " kiss the buttocks of a great fat woman , " and defeating the ' Big Show , ' ' Mideon ' and ' Viscera ' in a Dark Side Rules Match . More background history on this valuable addition to the Voyager guest cast list can be found on his official web site . <p> I still do n't like it , but the appearance by wrestlers on Voyager seems to be getting closer and closer . Unfortunately it is not yet known if ' Big Boss Man ' ( who was originally approached by Paramount ) will still be appearing on Voyager , but at least we now know for certain that the Rock will be guest starring . Very major thanks go out to Jose for pointing me to this ! <p> " Survival Instinct " had a gutsy ending , quite the opposite of the usual pat wrap-ups ( or the utterly chaotic failure to achieve closure in episodes which seem to be getting shorter by the week ) . The character growth for Seven seemed sincere , not just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the scene with the Doctor was breathtaking - the recognition of their parallels , his realization that the Hippocratic Oath applies to living as well as to life . I wish they were n't the only two characters we ever saw such consistent development from , but I have to admit the writers do well by them . <p> What does it mean that Voyager 's two most interesting characters are the ones who are largely machine , while the human characters act like badly-programmed automatons most of the time ? This show retreads the issue of Seven 's individuality so often that it should feel redundant , but it does n't . It 's of crucial importance that she be reminded how precious her freedom is . Why do n't the rest of the characters get the same freedoms , the same explorations ? <p> Sad as it is , Green certainly seems to be right about this . Let 's hope some of the other characters will also be explored later on in the season , instead of just Seven . In any case , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . <p> Ryan At ' Men Cry Bullets ' PremiereChristian ( 5:40 pm CST ) The official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage is reporting that Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) will be attending the October 9 screening of ' Men Cry Bullets , ' her feature film debut . She will be at the Laemmles Sunset 5 in Los Angeles from 10 pm until midnight , accompanied , presumably , by film director Tamara Hernandez . <p> ' Survival Instinct ' Tube Review Christian ( 5:40 pm CST ) A review of Voyager 's ' Survival Instinct ' has appeared at Tube Reviews , the new genre reviews spin-off site from the people who brought you Eon Magazine . Awarding it no more than a C+ , reviewer Jeff Bond apparently did n't feel Ron Moore 's last solo Trek outing was a fitting farewell : <p> " Survival Instinct " is about people rather than time/space anomalies , giving it a leg up on most VOYAGER fare , but it 's sad that one of the pivotal contributors to the TREK mythos has to go out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing given this story 's potential to linger in our memories . <p> The full review , including a little conspiracy theory about Paramount deliberately destructing the episode , can be found here . <p> Starburst Interviews Jonathan FrakesChristian ( 5:40 pm CST ) British magazine publisher Visual Imaginations Publications has just announced the contents of its autumn ' Starburst Special ' magazine . This time , the magazine is focused almost completely on Star Trek , featuring interviews with important Trek people , episode guides and other background info . On their site , they 've already put up a preview of one of these features , namely the interview with Jonathan Frakes . In it , he also talks about his new series ' Roswell : ' <p> " I was dying to get into an hour show that was not about spaceships , " admits Frakes , " so this was the easiest step for the industry to accept me taking . I spent 10 years in a spaceship , so it is nice for me to have characters who have pockets in their pants and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and director and , because I had to reshoot the ending of Insurrection , they put David Nutter on the pilot he was the perfect guy because he was on The X-Files . " <p> Roswell spotlights the three teenage aliens attending high school in Roswell , New Mexico , in 1999 . So what 's the connection with the 1947 crash ? Frakes explains , " It will be revealed as the season goes along that they were actually pods that opened up 19 years ago . We 'll cover where these kids actually came from and how they were taken into foster homes and were finally adopted that 's all going to be dealt with in the first 10 or 12 episodes . " <p> In the full interview , Frakes talks about the relative lack of success for ' Insurrection , ' and he has some thoughts on Star Trek in general . Find it all here . <p> Even more interesting stuff can of course be found in the full edition of the new Starburst Special , which should be available for GBP 3.99 now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the new Trek series , Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) on a longer break until Trek X , Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) , Robert Beltran ( Chakotay ) and Andrew Robinson ( Garak ) . If you pick up the magazine , I 'd very much appreciate it to hear from you - I 'm particularly interested in the contents of that Rick Berman interview . <p> Cinescape Reviews ' Survival Instinct'Christian ( 5:39 pm CST ) Over at Cinescape , regular site contributor Michael Marek has put up a review of ' Survival Instinct , ' Wednesday 's new Voyager episode . Though it 's more of a synopsis than an actual analysis of the episode , it still has a few interesting points to make . You can find the review via the main Cinescape site . <p> Happy Birthday !

Long live the weekend . <p> Thursday September 30 , 1999 <p> Starfleet Command Patch ListChristian ( 5:31 pm CST ) Starfleet Command fan site Starfleet Universe has published a huge update about the 1.02.00 patch for Interplay 's new real-time strategy game . After emailing game designer Chris Taylor , they received the full ' fix list ' for the patch , listing which problems have already been solved . According to the report , the patch is in an early form right now and the team continue to fix bugs that the beta testers find , as well as continuing to work on the Gorn and Hydran missions .

' Despite a few shortcomings , Jamahl apparently thought this episode worked rather well : <p> Problems aside , " Equinox , Part II " is possibly Voyager 's best season kickoff . While this half of " Equinox " does n't begin to revisit many of the issues of Starfleet officers pushed to their limits in the Delta Quadrant ( a la part one ) , overall , it 's done better than the first part , and it finds an angle almost as interesting , showing the obsessions of Janeway 's sense of moral righteousness--which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see through . She ultimately does n't have to , but seeing her intent is certainly worth the time . <p> The full review , in which the episode is awarded 3 out of 4 stars , can be found here . <p> Even Less Sci-Fi Channel TOS AirtimeChristian ( 5:23 pm CST ) Fred Shedian , columnist at the Trek Nation , just sent in a rather alarming news report . Starting Monday , October 4th , the Sci-Fi Channel will no longer being showing " Star Trek " at 7:00pm ( ET ) and 11:00pm ( ET ) . They are moving to a new setup for their weekly broadcasts . Now , the show will only be seen Monday through Friday at 5:00pm ( ET ) . The Sci-Fi Channel apparently are n't that keen on making this public - their official Star Trek site still lists the old times , and one has to really dig into their schedule to discover the change . The rescheduling will coincide with the start of the start of the fourth run of the Original Series - on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Man Trap . ' <p> Two New ' DS9 : The Fallen ' PreviewsChristian ( 5:22 pm CST ) Over the past 24 hours , two new previews of ' Deep Space Nine : The Fallen ' have appeared , one showing off some of the game 's superb graphics , while the other one has some more detail on the story itself . <p> The GA-Source Preview does n't really have that much text , but it does include a few absolutely fantastic images . Especially the characters look great - Gul Dukat is practically indistinguishable from the real version . <p> The CGO Online Preview is a bit more meaty , and focuses especially on the tie-in between the computer game and the ' DS9 : Millennium ' trilogy Pocket Books will be publishing next year . The preview also contains a short mention of a new DS9 game Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive are working on - ' Dominion Wars , ' a ' real-time game of tactical combat .

That 's down from last week 's 6.9/9 and fairly even with last year 's showing from " Drone . " The rating is pretty consistent with the overnight average from last season , as well . <p> Voyager finished in a very strong 4th for the hour against first-run Fox and WB competition . Fox 's " Get Real " was two spots behind " Survival Instinct " on the night , pulling the lowest rating for any network , a 3.9/6 . The WB aired a sneak preview of it 's new series " Popular " to take the 5th place spot , bringing in a 4.7/7 . The big three were well above Voyager 's showing . " Seven Days " performed below " Equinox , Part I " ' s rerun rating last week , earning a 4.3/7 and 6th in its timeslot . In comparison , " WWF Smackdown " earned a 5.2/8 last week . <p> The full report contains a comparison of this season and the last , plus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' New Worlds ' PreviewChristian ( 5:22 pm CST ) IPlayGames , a fan site for games published by Interplay , has put up a preview of ' New Worlds , ' the upcoming real-time strategy game in development by 14 Degrees East . One of the things the preview talks about is the different attitudes necessary for each race : <p> The races in the game will also be implemented superbly . Apart from each having access to different buildings and vehicles , a player must act within the rules and regulations pertaining to their specific race . For example , a Federation player must act within the StarFleet protocol whilst a Klingon can take a much more aggressive attitude into things ( although certain ethical restraints do apply ) and finally a Romulan can pretty much do whatever they like , as long as they complete the mission objectives pretty cool eh ! <p> The full preview can be found here . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for this . <p> ' Barge Of The Dead ' TrailerChristian ( 5:22 pm CST ) SciFi Headquarters has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead , ' next week 's new Voyager episode .

Now that Deep Space Nine has finished airing even the last run of its rerun episodes , the people at the official Continuum updated the ' Upcoming DS9 Episode ' page with the following information : <p> Star Trek : Deep Space Nine has ended its production run . Please check local listings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in syndication . <p> Wednesday September 29 , 1999 <p> Voyager Predicts PastChristian ( 5:58 pm CST ) NOTE : Below you will find spoilers for the upcoming Voyager episode ' One Small Step . ' You can click here to move on to the next update , though that wo n't do you much good , as that contains spoilers for another episode . <p> If you really want to avoid any and all Voyager episode spoilers , you should probably click here . <p> In a rare case of openness about an upcoming episode , the official Continuum has put up an article about ' One Small Step , ' an upcoming Voyager episode currently scheduled for the November sweeps . Apparently , the episode strongly mirrors events which only recently happened in the real world : <p> Do you like stories of strange new worlds and spacecraft lost in space ? This is usually the fare for Star Trek : Voyager but now it 's reality for a number of engineers and scientists within the space program . Last week NASA reported that the Mars Climate Observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strangely this reflects the fictional world in an upcoming Star Trek : Voyager episode . In " One Small Step " directed by Robert Picardo ( The Doctor ) the Starship Voyager encounters events that parallel the recent news stories about the Orbiter . <p> " Ironically , history seems to be mirroring our show , " said Brannon Braga , Executive Producer of Star Trek : Voyager . " There are eerie parallels to what happened this week with the Mars Orbiter . " The forthcoming episode tells the story of one of the first manned missions to Mars and how the U.S.S. Voyager encounters evidence of this lost mission . <p> More on the episode , which was written by Mike Wollaegar , Jessica Scott , Bryan Fuller and Michael Taylor , can be found in the full article . It also contains some more background on NASA 's attempts to reach Mars , and a few quotes from Michael Okuda talking about the relationship between NASA and Trek . Thanks go out to Warp Eleven for pointing me to this ! <p> Cinescape'sSteve Hockensmith has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ' series , this time interviewing Voyager 's Roxann Dawson ( B'Elanna Torres ) . Naturally , one of the questions deals with the upcoming ' Barge of the Dead ' episode : <p> What can you tell me about " Barge of the Dead " ? <p> It 's great . Torres has a near-death experience and finds herself on the Barge of the Dead , which is mythological . It 's the ship that charters the dead to hell , and there 's not much hope for escape once you 're on it . Torres discovers that her mother is there , and when she 's revived from this near-death experience , she is determined to go back and rescue her . Not out of any kind of love , because there 's not a lot of love lost between them and they 've never really gotten along , but because the reason her mother is there is possibly because Torres has always denied her Klingon heritage , and the parents take on the sins of their children . So it 's her duty to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think B'Elanna discovers what being a Klingon truly is . <p> Two more questions can be found here , while for the full interview you 'll have to buy the actual magazine . <p> BBC Buys RoswellChristian ( 5:44 pm CST ) Planet Riker is reporting that the BBC has bought the rights to the first season of ' Roswell , ' the new sci-fi series premiering next week on the WB and being co-produced by Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) . According to the report , the BBC will start airing the series in Autumn 2000 . <p> Cheaper ' Insurrection ' MerchandiseChristian ( 5:44 pm CST ) John Witzig at the Flagship , just returned from a very extended hiatus , has posted news that ' Insurrection ' merchandise has taken a big hit in price .

I would have provided a local mirror , but unfortunately the Sev Trek site seems incredibly slow today , so I have n't been able to actually download the file . <p> Huge Margaret Clark Q&amp;AChristian ( 5:43 pm CST ) Margaret Clark , Star Trek non-fiction and DS9 editor at Pocket Books , has just updated her Q&amp;A board with an incredible amount of answers to fan questions .

Centaur as an example of what we can expect ? <p> Response from : Margaret Clark No problem . No illo ... <p> Centaur , U.S.S. Federation starship . The Centaur was commanded by Captain Charles Reynolds . In 2374 the Centaur encountered a Jem'Hadar attack ship.The Centaur was named for the creature from Greek mythology that had the head and torso of a man joined to the body of a horse . <p> Lots more answers , plus a rather long preview of the second DS9 Millennium novel ( ' The War of the Prophets ' ) can be found in the full update . <p> James Darren Chat TranscriptChristian ( 5:43 pm CST ) The speed demons at the official Continuum have finally put up the transcript of their chat with James Darren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th of September . Take a look at three of the most interesting questions asked : <p> Joann asks : Did you have much influence on the creation of your character Vic Fontaine ? <p> James Darren : When I read the script and I read how they 'd written the character , I did n't really ask anyone 's opinion , necessarily , about this character . But in reading it , I instantly felt that I knew the character , had met and known people very similar to the character , and I felt that a combination of Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin and myself was exactly what that character should be . And Ira Behr , who created the character , thought I was right on the money . Thank God . <p> James Darren : It 's very difficult for me to watch myself . In fact , it 's even difficult for me to shave . I 'm so super-critical that if I watch my performance , I try desperately to be objective , but at times , I find things that I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to be fair to my mind and body ... I do n't watch myself . <p> Dawn asks : I 'm glad you are getting into the world of computers . Do you have , or will you have your own " OFFICIAL James Darren Website " ? <p> The Major has updated the guide through Blaze of Glory , and Decipher is pleased to offer it on the Web site for the first time as an official Star Trek CCG rules document . Please note , it 's a great tool for TD 's and players , but it 's not a required rules supplement . The Guide is consistent with the rules for dilemma resolution found in the Rules Booklet Glossary , but it shows you exactly how to use those rules on a case by case basis . <p> You can download the guide in Adobe Acrobat ( . pdf ) format via this page . <p> Mania Rates The RatingsChristian ( 5:42 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green over at AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine has put up an article looking at Voyager 's ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ratings which Paramount announced did so well . Unfortunately , Green seems to think otherwise : <p> This week , instead of gossip , rumors , or innuendo , I thought we should take a good , hard look at something incontrovertible : the ratings . <p> " Incontrovertible " is probably the wrong word , since the networks seem to be able to convert the numbers into meaning whatever they want them to . Take the season premiere of Star Trek Voyager . Last week , as you may have noticed in AnotherUniverse.com 's Buzz column , Star Trek Voyager got stellar ratings for its season premiere . Like most of the press which widely reported that bit of good news , the Buzz cited a Paramount press release which was widely disseminated over the wire services and the internet . We were in good company ; virtually every trade publication and several newspapers reported exactly the same information about the dazzling overnight ratings for Voyager . <p> And it 's all true ... except for the very salient details which the press release left out , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings triumph they 're being called . <p> In the full article , she tells us why she believes the Equinox ratings were not all that good , and compares Voyager 's third and fourth seasons . <p> Personally I believe Green is a bit too negative in this article . For one thing , I 'm not sure what the use is of comparing the third and the fourth seasons with each other when we 're already in the sixth season . Furthermore , she does n't seem to take into account the drop in UPN coverage over the past season , which certainly makes the ' Equinox , Part Two ' ratings look a bit better . Hopefully today 's showing of ' Survival Instinct ' will show that Voyager is n't completely dead yet . <p> Trek Needs You ! Christian ( 5:42 pm CST ) Though the importance of this may be questioned , Cinescape has put up a new poll , asking visitors what they believe is the coolest genre franchise ever .

' 163809 @qwx573809 <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 5:40 pm CST ) It appears Star Trek is n't as well-known in other parts of the world as it is in the Western world . This morning , a Chinese acquaintance saw the charcoal artwork of Picard and Riker I have hanging here above my computer at TrekToday HQ . She looked at it for a while , then said " Ah ! Are they your father and grandfather ? " <p> Tuesday September 28 , 1999 <p> Huge Voyager Spoiler ReportChristian ( 5:52 pm CST ) NOTE : As the title implies , below you will find spoilers for at least three episodes of Voyager 's new season , plus on that entire season in general . Click here to avoid those . <p> Daniel Sterman just sent in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contans lots of new info on Voyager 's sixth season . First of all , Daniel tells us the magazine has the following to say about the upcoming episode ' Alice : ' <p> Robert Duncan McNeill said that this episode deals with " Paris 's obsession with fast ships and that classic male connection to toys ... we come across a junkyard in space , and we trade for some things we can use . " He finds an old , beat-up shuttle and falls in love with it . " The shuttle is n't just any ordinary shuttle ; it takes on this life of its own , and develops a relationship with Paris and starts to control him in many ways . " <p> Brannon Braga said this episode is " kind of like ' Christine ' , that Stephen King novel " . McNeill added that " It was fun to play around with the whole idea of this ghost thing , where the shuttle takes on the form of a person ... it 's really just in his Paris 's mind that he sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all is not right with Paris , " and she goes to find help and get the captain . " This episode also guest stars John Fleck . <p> Following this , the magazine provided a bit of info on ' Riddles , ' Roxann Dawson 's directorial debut . They do n't really provide a lot of info on this , though Brannon Braga does say that it is " a very charming episode in which Tuvok suffers a neural trauma , and Neelix has to help him recover . " <p> The next episode they talk about is ' One Small Step , ' the Mars episode directed by Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) . Apparently , the ' Voyager ' production crew built a Mars command module for this episode , making it " as detailed and accurate as possible based on NASA 's projections of what manned Mars missions might involve , ' according to Braga . In the magazine , Picardo says that " it 's a Chakotay story , with heavy support from Tuvok , that 's all about his roots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastly , the magazine contained the following general Season Six info : <p> Braga and the writers mapped out the first half of the season already , and they 're projecting further in .

Jim Wright over at Delta Blues has uploaded his first Voyager review of the season , this time looking at ' Equinox , Part Two .

The big question is , will the trend continue ? <p> It 's hard to say from a single episode , particularly a conclusion to a summer cliffhanger . I can say , though , that I liked this episode more than the conclusion to Scorpion that launched Season Four . Which is intriguing , because " Scorpion " and " Equinox " have much in common ( Voyager gets reluctant additions to the crew ; the captain and First Officer butt heads over a very thorny command decision ; Janeway puts her ship in harm 's way . ) <p> But I found this story a good deal meatier--and more believable--than Scorpion . The characterizations and performances also held together quite well overall . The one big risk , which I 'm not sure succeeded , was putting Janeway in a very unsympathetic light . I thought it worked well on a dramatic level , but on a fan level it may have done more harm than good to the Janeway character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded 3.5 out of 4 stars .

Pierpoint is probably best known for his role as George Francisco on ' Alien Nation , ' though he also appeared on several Trek episodes . In a few weeks , he will be seen on Trek yet again , this time as the Kortar , the disgraced Klingon doomed forever to ferry lost souls across the River of Blood to ' Grethor . ' In the interview , Pierpont talks a bit about what this actually is : <p> Grethor was initially a fully-conceived Hell with Siren-like beings that would call lost souls into the river of blood , but the length of the script and the complex plot involving B'Elanna Torres and her long-lost mother became too complicated for the producers . In the early drafts , Kortar reportedly spent a great deal of time trying to convince Torres to stay with him and rule Grethor , ultimately falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cut to a few scenes in order to make room for appearances by the rest of the regular castmembers . <p> " The script was about B'Elanna Torres ' attempts to get her mother to Sto-Vo-Kor by going into this sort of dream state , almost like another dimension , going into her own mind to the barge of the dead where she 's trying to somehow patch up past misunderstandings with her mother so her mother can peacefully let go , " revealed Pierpoint . " Kortar of course was trying to convince B'Elanna Torres to stay with him . It was unfortunate , because there was a big , big story , but they had to go a different way . But they let Kortar remain , so that you could go back to that place in the future for another episode ; they did n't do away with the character .

The incredibly lucky Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga will be there , and he sent in a list of people attending the screening today . The event will be attended by actors Avery Brooks , RenT Auberjonois , Nicole deBoer , Michael Dorn , Alexander Siddig and Nana Visitor , which means the entire cast except for Armin Shimerman , Colm Meaney and Cirroc Lofton . The event will also be attended by producers Rick Berman , Ira Steven Behr Lofton and several supporting cast members , while all those people will also be attending a Q&amp;A session at the end of the finale showing . <p> On Friday there 'll be another showing , but that one wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be personally introducing the episode . <p> Fungi headpieces ! Apologies for the glut of DS9 cartoons lately but I 'm stocking up on Snog comic strips for Aron Eisenberg 's appearance at the Sydney FSF convention on June 13 ( I 'm doing a workshop there so Sydney readers , be sure to drop by to say hi ) . <p> Overall , I found myself enjoying a good episode . I am ecstatic for next week and the final two hour explosion-o-rama and the conclusion to DS9 , and a bit forelorn . DS9 withdrawal may be a serious problem ! There is still LOTS to cover , but after eight episodes the main themes remaining seem doable : <p> The war . Cardassia 's fate . Dukat and Winn . Sisko 's most difficult trial . The Resistance . <p> That 's about it ... and that , to me , seems like a good place to be in after eight episodes ... <p> Bad ' Equinox ' RatingsChristian ( 2:09 pm CST ) I have to say I 'm getting more and more pessimistic about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just put up the overnight ratings report for the Voyager season finale , and , unfortunately , the news is extremely bad : <p> The overnight rating for Voyagers season final ' Equinox ' is in , and Voyager did not do well .

Voyager was 6th for the hour , behind WBs ' Charmed ' that got 0.1 more . 7 Days got the same as last week , namely a 3.6/6 . <p> A final rating would be around 2.8 - 3.3 . <p> This is NOT good . ' Equinox ' was the season finale , and should at least have gotten more viewers than ' Warhead . ' Voyager 's ratings continue to go down , and they ca n't go down much more before Paramount management looses all trust in Star Trek . The franchise is still making money for Paramount , of course , but once Voyager ends , the decision for a new series will in no small part be influenced by the ratings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the ratings *really* need to improve - otherwise we the franchise might not be able to live long and prosper anymore . <p> Next Generation Of Trek GamesChristian ( 2:08 pm CST ) The British PC Zone has put up a report of last week 's E3 conference , looking in detail at four of the upcoming Star Trek games ( Voyager : Elite Force , Armada , Insurrection and Deep Space Nine : The Fallen ) . The preview contains several bold statements by important Activision people : <p> with the gaming market already awash with Star Trek titles from a number of publishers including Interplay , Hasbro Interactive and Simon &amp; Schuster can Activision really bring anything new with them ?

Michelle Erica Green starts her review of ' The Dogs Of War ' by telling us about her least and her most favourite elements of the episode : <p> The calm before the final storm , this was a near-perfect episode despite minute appearances by my favorite characters and no guest spots by my favorite recurring characters . I 'm reserving judgement on the Federation 's appalling willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curing the Founders ... forgetting all discussion of moral responsibility , everyone in the galaxy is going to have it in for the Federation when word gets out . Odo 's bitterness was well-played but I was bothered that he promised Sisko not to interfere . Why the hell should he not save his people when Sisko 's people murdered them ? And how can Sisko not expect him to ? <p> The comic Ferengi storyline was a scream , probably my favorite Ferengi episode ever in terms of deconstructing the ideology of that greedy species , but the best lines were Quark 's references to other stories in the arc - calling do-good-ism a disease his planet had caught from the Federation and declaring Sisko-style that the line must be drawn here . It 's also poetic justice that Rom should end up as Nagus in addition to being real justice for the Ferengi people : unlike his brother , who seems to have learned nothing despite having been involuntarily exiled for a time , Rom has Moogie 's social conscience and Leeta 's concern for workers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he 's bound to realize sooner or later is a good place for him . <p> Sloan Starring In ' Roswell High'Christian ( 2:06 pm CST ) Yesterday I posted about a report at Cinescape , which provided the first details of ' Roswell High , ' the new series produced by Jonathan Frakes . In the report , they mentioned that the one adult role in the series would be that of the town 's sheriff which will be played by veteran character actor William Sadler ( The Shawshank Redemption , Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey ) . DangerMom was kind enough to point out to me that this is , in fact , the actor who used to guest star on Deep Space Nine as Luther Sloan , everyone 's favourite secret agent . Thanks go out to DangerMom for pointing this out to me ! <p> ' Trekkies ' Chat Postponed ?

Submit advance questions here , and get info on how to participate here . <p> This was a cool season-ending cliffhanger for some science fiction show - not necessarily Voyager , as the continuity problems with " Caretaker " really got on my nerves , but for some other series with a captain who needs to have her outdated rule book removed from her as ... trometrics lab . Oh , of course she was right , Ransom 's behavior was beyond the pale , and her Kirk-like response reminded me of " The Omega Glory . " Still , I could not help laughing at Princess Kathryn 's righteous indignation towards John Savage : not only is she a big fat stinkin ' liar if she thinks she 's never broken the Prime Directive , she does n't even know that her precious Starfleet is taking advantage of Section 31 's decision to commit genocide to win a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty fighting . <p> Mulgrew Signs On For Season 7Christian ( 2:05 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green at Mania 's Daily Buzz is reporting one of the best news items imaginable - Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) has signed a contract to stay on the show for the full 7 seasons . She said this in an interview with WOR-TV in New York , which yesterday aired an interview with her : <p> Though Mulgrew has been quoted several times recently as wishing to move on , she cited her allegiance to the cast and crew , saying she did n't want them to suffer if she left . She also expressed her belief that Deep Space Nine fans would switch their loyalty to Voyager now that the previous series has wrapped production . <p> Cleveland affiliate WUAB also quoted Mulgrew as saying that she intended to remain in California for the remaining two seasons , then split her time between theatrical work in New York and her new husband 's home in Ohio . <p> I wonder what the status of Jeri Ryan now is - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' want off the show , ' though it looks now as if that could just be rumours the actresses themselves leaked in order to get a stronger negotiating position . <p> New York Yesterdaily NewsChristian ( 2:04 pm CST ) The New York Daily News has put up a preview of , erm , yesterday 's showing of the Voyager season finale , ' Equinox . ' Actually they put up the preview yesterday , but I did n't find it until today . Here 's what reviewer David Bianculli had to say about the episode : <p> This two-parter , written by Brannon Braga and Joe Menosky ( based on a story by them and Rick Berman ) and directed by David Livingston , leaves the Voyager crew in dire peril but also leaves the show in good shape to start its sixth season in the fall . <p> Insurrection Rental Stays At No.3Christian ( 2:04 pm CST ) The Video Software Dealers Association just announced the top 10 renting videos for the week ended May 23 , 1999 . No real surprises can be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've Got Mail , ' followed by ' Stepmom ' at no.2 and ' Insurrection ' at no.3 .

Christian ( 2:03 pm CST ) The weather is absolutely great here in the Netherlands ! I do n't think it was ever before so hard to get myself to update the site again - with this weather you just want to sit outside in the sun and relax . Still , in the end I was able to drag myself to the computer , so now you can all behold the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1999 <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' InterviewChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) As part of our special series of reports from last week 's Electronic Entertainment Expo , we 've put up an exclusive interview dealing with the ' Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force ' game . In the interview , Activision QA lead David Fischer and Raven director Brian Pelletier talk about this upcoming action game : <p> Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga : " So tell me about Elite Force . " <p> David Fischer : " It 's a first person shooter , but based more on a co-op mode where you 're a lead in a commanding force instead of just being a one-man Rambo versus the whole alien forces . The story is that the Borg have taken your ship and have drained all the power and have disabled your ship inside of a ship graveyard , basically with a bunch of other ships . There becomes the levels . There are going to be 30 levels in the game . So while you 're stuck your object is to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ... rescue your ship basically . So during that you 're going to find 30 different levels with 30 different kinds of aliens , or at least a good number of aliens -- put it that way . All the races that are in Voyager will be in here . This will be one of the most true-to-life games to the TV series that you will get . " <p> The full interview , as conducted by Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga , contains info on the game 's storyline , the alien races ( including the Borg , Klingons &amp; Species 8472 ) and the relationship between the developers and Paramount . Find it all here . <p> Interactive DS9 QuizChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) The people at TV Guide have put up an interactive Deep Space Nine , where you 'll be able to test your knowledge of the series in 15 questions . I made one mistake , unfortunately , when I chose the wrong name for the first ship Benjamin Sisko served on as first officer . You can see if you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3:15 pm CST ) Marco Palmieri , editor at Pocket Books , has finally updated his ' Editor 's Log , ' in which he gives new info on some upcoming Trek books he 's editing . He gives out some info on the ' Lives of Dax ' anthology , the ' New Worlds , New Civilizations ' coffee-table book and the upcoming ' Star Trek Trivia Book , ' but he also reports about his recent trip to Los Angeles . He was there to meet with the Paramount people , and to discuss some book ideas he had for the next couple of years . Below are the three projects he just announced : <p> SECTION THIRTY-ONE - four novels -one for each series- telling new stories of each crew 's experience with the Federation 's black ops agency . To be published in October and November of 2000 . <p> SPLIT INFINITIES ( working title ) - A two-volume series of four novellas each , exploring alternate ST realities . The novellas will springboard from established continuity and answer questions such as : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What if Spock had allowed Sarek to die in ' Journey to Babel ' ? " and " What if Ro Laren had become the Liaison Officer of DS9 ? " <p> ... <p> But I think the thing I 'm most excited about is that I 'm spearheading the new creative direction of our publishing program for STAR TREK : DEEP SPACE NINE , with stories that take place after the explosive series finale . I 'm really sinking my teeth into this project , working with authors even as I write this to create exciting new adventures involving the Alpha Quadrant 's hotbed of political and scientific intrigue . <p> His full Editor 's Log goes into some more detail about the ' Split Infinities ' project , but also talks about the three other books I mentioned earlier . <p> Many aspects of " Extreme Measures " seem grossly out of place . The final stretch of DS9 so far has been woven together into a mostly well-thought-out story that understands the nature of a greater purpose . Seeds are planted , then they grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot that , for the most part , seems to go nowhere we needed to go--certainly not where I wanted to go . What 's most disappointing is that Section 31 is brought in as the story 's central element , and then not used for what it has come to best represent--an immense moral issue with which our characters must wrestle . <p> This could 've been a great episode . It should 've been a great episode . Frankly , I 'm a little shocked that it did n't live up to its potential . This has to be one of the most unexpected disappointments of the season . <p> Shatner 's " Life ! " is the most forgiving , mostly because Shatner is trying to get us to forgive HIM . According to the repeated mea culpas peppering this book , Shatner acknowledges having been suspicious and dismissive of " Trek " fans for the last 25 years . The title , in fact , comes from a notorious 1986 " Saturday Night Live " sketch in which Shatner played himself screaming at " Trek " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV show ! " he thundered from the podium . " Have you ever even kissed a girl ? Move out of you parents ' basement ! GET A LIFE ! " <p> Shatner would now have us believe that he 's seen the Lights of Zetar . Of " Trek " fans he says , " You guys are open , you 're warm , you 're caring , you 're uninhibited , and sometimes you ARE a little weird , but you wear your love of our beat-up , middle-aged franchise like a badge of honor , and you support every single one of us who 's ever been privileged to wear a Starfleet uniform . I ca n't POSSIBLY thank you enough . " <p> He 's slightly less positive about ' Trekkies , ' though he still thinks it 's ' a genuinely uplifting experience for fans . ' The full review has more . <p> " Warhead " is a tough episode to judge -- given Voyagers recent disasterous ratings , you could see this as simply a continuation of a new trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as a show which would have scored a much higher rating had it not been airing against the ultimate competition : Star Wars . <p> In any case , the rating in a vacuum is pretty dismal , as has been the usual lately . The episode scored a 3.3 rating , 5 share . That 's flat from last week and down a ton from last year 's Season Finale , " Hope and Fear , " which earned a 4.1 . That 3.3 rating is getting signifigantly closer to becoming the season average , but is now still below this season 's usual mark . <p> Info on Warhead 's performance compared to the competition can be found in the full report . I really hope tonight 's ' Equinox ' will finally do better again - if even the season finale is n't able to bring in higher ratings , it would not be good news for Star Trek 's future . <p> William Shatner will be book signing on May 26 from 7pm to 8pm at in the Westside Pavilion ( first floor - street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overland and Pico ) in Los Angeles for two of his books ... " Get A Life " and " Dark Victory " . If you need better directions , you can call Waldenbooks at 310-474-6550 . <p> The idea of Captain Proton , on the show , is that he 's a fictional SF character from the pulp magazines and films of the 1930s . Our Captain Proton book is an issue of the CAPTAIN PROTON magazine , done as it would have been in the 30s . In other words , this is an issue of the magazine that the Captain Proton scenario Tom Paris plays on Voyager is based on . Think of it as an artifact from an alternate universe. : ) <p> There is a Captain Proton lead novella , a chapter of a Captain Proton serial novel , a Buster Kincaid short story , a Constance Goodheart short-story , a couple of articles on the " science " of Captain Proton 's universe , a piece , done as if written in the 1930s , about what the year 2000 will be like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell already , let me say we all had great fun putting the sucker together. : ) <p> In a follow-up post , he later mentioned precisely who wrote the stories in the ' magazine . ' <p> Dorn Speaks OutChristian ( 3:13 pm CST ) As part of their special DS9 feature , TV Guide have put up a short video interview with Michael Dorn , who stars as Worf on Deep Space Nine : <p> In this exclusive TV Guide Channel interview , the Deep Space Nine star reveals his feelings about the ending of the show . For more with Michael , watch his Insider segment on the TV Guide Channel all this week ! <p> In the interview , he does his usual complaining about getting tired of the show and overstaying his welcome , but he also mentions that for him this ending is n't as emotional as TNG 's ending was . The reason for this is apparently because he ' was n't there from the start .

' As you may recall , this series will be produced by Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) , and will be airing directly opposite Voyager . Take a look at what the series will deal with : <p> Colin Hanks , the 19-year-old son of Tom Hanks , has been cast as one of the regular teenage roles in the series . According to the New York Post , Hanks officially got the role yesterday . The tabloid reports that the program 's regular cast will be made of seven teenagers and one adult role ( hmmm , sounds a little like Buffy ) . The adult role is that of the town 's sheriff which will be played by veteran character actor William Sadler ( The Shawshank Redemption , Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey ) . <p> Roswell is said to be based on the Roswell High young-adult book series by Melinda Metz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress ( Shiri Appleby ) at a little diner gets shot and an alien being in human form ( played by Dawson 's Creek 's Jason Behr ) ... who also happens to be one of her classmates at Roswell High ... miraculously heals her .

The article deals with the fact that the wedding ceremony took place in complete secrecy : <p> The 44-year-old actress quietly wed former Ohio politician Tim Hagan , 53 , in a ceremony so secret that the happy couple did n't invite any family members -- including their own children ! <p> " Kate and Tim wanted to keep their wedding day very low-key and quiet , " her mom Joan Mulgrew told The ENQUIRER .

Piller , who spoke of the project in various online chats and interviews , had planned to have the book published as a treat for fans who wanted to get a real insider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Trek feature , from storyboarding through release . <p> But now , word is that executives within Paramount 's own Motion Picture Group have killed the publication of the book ; a surprising move , considering the zeal with which new Trek-related merchandise is usually embraced by Paramount and its parent , Viacom . Although unofficial , reports claim that the studio justifies the action by saying it did n't want the book to provide ravenous fans with ammunition to discredit its decision-making during the creation of Star Trek : Insurrection . The movie , number nine in the franchise , performed below expectations of both the studio and the fans . <p> Michael Piller was , of course , the writer of ' Insurrection , ' and he would have been able to give an unique insight in precisely what went happened during the movie 's production . I certainly would have liked to read about precisely what people such as Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) and the studio execs wanted changed in the movie . TrekWeb has also added a commentary to the report , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Box Office ReportChristian ( 3:13 pm CST ) The Daily Variety has announced the final data for the top 60 movies at the North American box office during the May 21-23 weekend , and at the top of the list is ....

This places the documentary at the 34th place in the top 60 , giving it about $371 per screen . You can find the full top 60 here . BTW , has anyone else noticed that ' The Phantom Menace ' has already surpassed Insurrection 's total worldwide takings ? <p> Issue 35 of the British XposT magazine contains a report dealing with ' What You Leave Behind , ' the DS9 finale which will start airing next week . The report contains the already usual descriptions of what will happen to each character , but also contains the below info on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The word was always that he would become a prophet ; however this idea was quashed immediately by Mr Brooks as he did n't feel it was appropriate to African Americans . Hence our good captain and DS9 's arch nemesis Dukat fall to their deaths in a pit on Bajor in a scene which rings so many Generations bells it 's really not funny ! <p> I still do n't understand this . Why would turning into what is for the Bajoras god be more offensive than falling into a pit ? The way it 's mentioned here ( turning into god is not ' appropriate to African Americans ' ) could actually be interpreted as being offensive ! If someone could explain this to me , I 'd be more than happy to listen : - ) . Find the full article here . <p> Phew !

It got a viewing figure of 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the best illustration of this recovery . DS9 , however , was unranked for the third week running . One of the reasons for these low ratings may be that DS9 is currently running head to head with repeats of Friends on Channel 4 . For casual viewers who are n't watching the news , it 's more likely that they 'll choose Friends repeats than DS9 repeats . <p> Voyager was also back on BBC2 for this week . However , " Waking Moments " may have put a few people to sleep - the 2.06m audience rating was pretty mediocre . Sunday 23rd 's double bill of " Message in a Bottle " and " Hunters " should perform much better . Over on Sky , Voyager 's new season was half up , half down - the ranking dropped to #6 , but the viewing figure jumped to a good ( for Sky ) 740,000 .

Starship Defiant floor plans from the series were translated into the games - Star Trek fetishists will enjoy the ability to explore the ship - other gamers will probably want to skip this feature altogether . <p> From what we could see , gameplay looked streamlined - the use of inverse kinematics made for smooth movements , and a higher polygon count was implemented for the faces of the characters , to facilitate better speech simulation , though at this phase sound has yet to be added . The environs are dark , punctuated by excellent lighting effects . <p> You can find the full preview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going here .

' If you still want to enjoy the penultimate DS9 episode , I would n't advise reading it , but if you do want to be spoiled , you can find Marek 's report at Cinescape . <p> PC Action BotF ReviewChristian ( 3:10 pm CST ) Extremely bad news for fans of the new ' Birth of the Federation ' strategy game . The new June issue of PC Action , a German games magazine , contains a review of Microprose 's turn-based strategy game , in which it is awarded no more than 68% . Take a look at what reviewer Alexander Geltenpoth had to say about the game in his summary of the review : <p> When Microprose announced ' Birth of the Federation , ' I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 with current technology and the Star Trek background , what more could one want ? But then came the huge disappointment : Why was n't Microprose able to put all the relevant information on the colonies on one screen ? An hour gameplay now exists of 40 minutes of banal system administration , and just 20 minutes of strategy . That 's when the fun ends ! And when the 3D battles offer almost no tactical options , at least the graphics should convince . <p> Even when the other features have been improved since Master of Orion 2 ( just like in all other space strategy games ) , and even when the Star Trek license boldly tries to give some support , it is n't enough anymore for a good game . <p> If the above text is n't all too clear , that 's completely my fault - unfortunately neither German nor English is my native language , so I 'm not too sure about how well I was able to translate this . In any case , this is really bad news for ' Birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong supporter of the game ( they had two features on it , and even a cover dedicated to it a few months ago ) , and when even they do n't like it , that means a lot . Let 's hope other reviewers will be more positive . <p> Trekkies : Get WiredChristian ( 3:09 pm CST ) Joyce Slaton at Wired has put up an article dealing with the new ' Trekkies ' documentary , which she thinks is ' a laugh and a half , ' but also ' guaranteed to offend fans . ' In her article , she tries to avoid being offensive , and even includes the below info block about the distinction between ' Trekkies ' and ' Trekkers : ' <p> Editor 's note : Even in the film , people disagree over the distinction between Trekkies and Trekkers . Some people consider fans of the original " Star Trek " TV series Trekkies , and name fans of the new Star Trek films and TV series Trekkers . Others reserve the term Trekkies for people who are seemingly obsessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fans who " have lives " as Trekkers . In this article , Trekker is used for all Star Trek fans . <p> Amusingly , after this quote the word ' Trekker ' is n't even used once : - ) . The full article contains a review of the documentary , in the end still calling it a ' lot of fun , ' but offensive . <p> Shatner Campaigning For Return ? Christian ( 3:09 pm CST ) Soundcage just posted a message to the **25;553;TOOLONG newsgroup , mentioning that William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) recently appeared on the Regis and Kathy Lee talk show . Shatner was on the show to promote his new book ' Get A Life ! ' , but apparently he also mentioned he continues to lobby for the return of James T. Kirk . According to soundcage , Shatner said something along the lines of ' if the folks at Paramount are smart , they 'd bring Kirk back . ' When asked how , he mentioned something about Kirk still floating in the ' ether out there ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ) Major thanks go out to soundcage for posting about this .

Christian ( 3:08 pm CST ) Sound Source Interactive , the struggling publisher of several media tie-in CD-Roms , just announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31 , 1999 . The past three months were n't that good for the company - losses increased , and the company 's stocks may soon be delisted at Nasdaq due to bad performace . In the press release , however , CEO Vincent Bitetti commented that over the next 18 months , they 'll be releasing several new ' evergreens , ' including a project called ' Star Trek : Trivia Challenge . ' More info about this title is n't yet available , but my guess is it 'll be something like the ' Star Trek Game Show , ' which was also created by Sound Source Interactive . <p> Happy Birthday Susan Diol !

Christian ( 3:04 pm CST ) Just my luck - yesterday I sent out news submissions about Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga 's Star Trek : Armada preview to every gaming site under the sun , and exactly this morning the site statistics refused to update ! Aaargh ! <p> Monday May 24 , 1999 <p> ' Star Trek : Armada ' Designer InterviewChristian ( 1:35 pm CST ) As part of our special series of reports from last week 's Electronic Entertainment Expo , we 've just put up an exclusive interview with Dr. Ian Lane Davis , the lead programmer for Activision 's upcoming real-time strategy game ' Star Trek : Armada . ' Take a look at a short quote from the interview , in which Davis gives an overall description of the game : <p> Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armada . " <p> Ian Davis : " It 's a real-time strategy game set in the Star Trek : The Next Generation universe . We 're on the cutting-edge timeline . So we 're current with everything . We talk to Paramount every week about development . In addition , we have a few new ships and elements that we 're introducing into the Star Trek canon . We go through Paramount and through their approval process . They 've been just absolutely wonderful to work with . The game features Federation , Borg , Klingon , and Romulans . We have voiceovers in the game and in our cutscenes from Patrick Stewart , Michael Dorn , and even Denise Crosby as Sela . " <p> In the full interview , Davis talks about the game 's storyline , Paramount 's new policy towards licensed games , all the races you 'll be able to play as , and some info on editing the game . Find it all here ! <p> The plot of " Relativity " is like some sort of comic maze . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can barely restrain their grins of bemusement . This is Star Trek sci-fi on crack . <p> About 3 months ago my husband was going through his belongings from his childhood home and discovered footage taken at one of the first Star Trek conventions . After viewing the material we decided to preserve and market it with Star Trek fans all over the world . For more info , please visit my web site at www.startrekvideo.com .

It will be changed on either Monday or Tuesday to www.trektape.com . <p> MYSTERY OF THE WEEK : I 'm afraid I do n't see any point to having artificial intelligence in a bomb . It seems like entirely too much trouble and too fraught with potential problems , like , in this case , the bombs " not believing " their recall orders . Good old fashioned dumb bombs would seem to work just fine . <p> MYSTERY OF THE WEEK RUNNER-UP : Strange that the " enemy race " did n't react at all to the presence of this fleet of bombs within their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it meant we avoided another " Voyager attacked by surly forehead aliens " scene , since one was more than enough . <p> What 's interesting is that there was an apparent incident reported in the news lately where some Star Trek fans showed up en masse to picket and pick a fight with a line of Star Wars fans waiting to get into a screening of TPW because they did n't like the publicity SW was getting . <p> The one Enign just told me he also saw this being reported on the news , so it 's probably true . It 's also one of the saddest news items I 've heard in a long time - if ' Trekkies ' has n't already completely destroyed the public image of Trek fans , it certainly is completely shattered now . <p> Voyager 7th Season NewsChristian ( 1:33 pm CST ) No , this is not a typo , there really *is* news of Voyager 's 7th season to be found here , even though the 5th season is n't even over yet . Michael Iversen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian convention : <p> Duncan Burbidge attended a convention in Adelaide , among the guests was Garret Wang , wo confirmed that Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan were signed on for season 6 but were in negotiations for season 7 . The other cast members he said were signed on until the end . <p> Over the past few weeks there have been very persistent rumours that both Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) and Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) want off the show . Hopefully those are just rumours that were leaked by the actresses themselves ( in order to have a stronger position during the negotiations ) , as I doubt Voyager would be able to survive without its two main attractions . <p> Where to begin . Or should I say , when to begin . Some reviews practically write themselves . Some beg to be written . Others mockingly dare my to try . This was one of the latter . <p> I enjoyed the episode when I first watched it , though there are holes large enough to hold Amazon.com 's entire inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fun . " But if you spend any time at all thinking about it , forget it . <p> In the end , he does manage to write a small analysis ( and the usual huge synopsis ) , and ends up awarding the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars in his review . <p> The opening of DS9 's sixth season had the Cardassian/Dominion alliance occupying the station and Starfleet waging a desperately defensive war . A great deal of that arc worked very well , but about halfway into it we got a show entitled " Sons and Daughters " which felt jarringly out of place . The authors ? Bradley Thompson and David Weddle , who up until that point had written material which rose well above its premise , like " The Assignment " and " Business as Usual " . <p> Now , with only a few hours of DS9 left before the series closes its doors forever , we 're seeing history repeat itself . While the ideas behind " Extreme Measures " fit into this arc better than " Sons and Daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got even more questionable logic and plain old Stupid-Villain Plotting undercutting it . Other shows in this final set of episodes have had questionable moments , but this is the first show which came off as almost entirely disappointing . <p> Find the full review here , in which Lynch awards the episode no more than a four . <p> Welcome to issue 86 of Optical Data Network , the final issue before the US sees the end of Deep Space Nine . ( Will there be a special ODN next week ? Probably not , but it 's possible . ) <p> ... <p> This issue has an extensive list of ' Trekkies ' reviews , if you 're interested in knowing how it did . ... There 's also the news story about Star Trek bottled water , which proves that nothing is safe from the Trek merchandising machine . There are plenty of NewsBits regarding all facets of Trek , including the confirmation that Ron Moore is moving over to Voyager ( making two Ron Moores on staff there , Ron B and Ron D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list from Psi Phi , a Convention listing , the standard US ( Voyager season finale this week , if you have n't been paying attention ) and UK schedules , and the wrap-up of letters written from readers ( and another ) to say goodbye Deep Space Nine . ( Although you 're still welcome to send in your comments , I can continue the feature if there 's sufficient interest . ) <p> If , like me , you did n't actually receive the new issue , click here to read it online . <p> The best part of the episode was the camaraderie between Bashir and O'Brien , which has always been a strength on DS9 . It gave Bashir credible moments to demonstrate his genetic enhancement talents -- traits that often go ignored . And I enjoy almost any episode that focuses on O'Brien . Colm Meaney is probably my favorite actor of the weekly regulars , and in the show 's first couple of seasons , before Avery Brooks began to grow on me , I would occasionally wish that O'Brien could be the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified , but the contrast between the station 's alien weirdness and O'Brien 's meat-and-potatoes simplicity as a dedicated family man and hands-on engineer , always struck me as a fertile area for exploration . <p> Meaney and Siddig have always played off each other well , and I was amused at their sheepish admissions that they enjoy each other 's company better than Keiko or Dax , respectively . Extreme Measures may have reduced the momentum of The Final Chapter , but I 'm happy the show gave Bashir and O'Brien one last adventure together . <p> Robert Picardo Chat TonightChristian ( 1:30 pm CST ) At 8:00pm Eastern Time , TV Guide &amp; Yahoo ! will be hosting a live chat with Robert Picardo , most famous for his role of ' The Doctor ' on Star Trek : Voyager .

Over the past 30 years or so , hard-core fanciers of Star Trek , the series Gene Roddenberry brought to TV in 1969 , have built a cult that puts Star Wars to shame -- every weekend , in at least three places somewhere around the globe , there is a Star Trek convention . Taken together , these " cons " represent a pilgrimage for millions of trekkies ( or " trekkers , " as serious fanatics prefer to be called ) . Trekkies are not your average middle-American types . <p> For a while , Trekkies looks like a freak show , where we are confronted with enough horrors for 20 years of Jerry Springer programs . For example , we are given the case of Barbara Adams , trekkie and print-shop employee in Little Rock , Ark. , who served as a juror in the Whitewater trial in her Starfleet officer 's uniform , and who insists on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the O. J. Simpson jury needed her ? ) <p> Or the 14-year-old veteran of 28 conventions , who wants to make his own Star Trek movie but looks and talks more like the kind of kid destined to put on a trench coat and take his guns to school . Or the veterinary student who dresses his cat up in scrubs , as Dr. Bones McCoy , a character in the original TV show . Or the wild-eyed guy who had his name legally changed to James T. Kirk . ( " I met someone who told me , ' I wish I 'd had the guts to do that . ' " ) <p> In the end he awards the documentary 3 stars , as you can read in the full review . <p> Insurrection DVD Enters Top 25Christian ( 1:29 pm CST ) While the Insurrection Rental Video may not be doing as well as expected , the DVD certainly is .

Sluss is n't at all impressed with ' Extreme Measures , ' the latest DS9 episode . In his Cynics Corner review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again finds lots of issues with the episode : <p> ALLEGORY OF THE WEEK : Star Trek is known for embedding contemporary issues into its sci-fi plots . One of the biggest issues in the United States at this time is espionage and incompetent government agencies . In this episode , Section 8 plays the role only too well . It 's hard to believe that Section 8 could have been successful in its mission and maintained its secrecy for two hundred years , given the level of ineptitude shown here . <p> First , we have Section 8 falling for Bashir 's fake message in the first place . Second , we have Section 8 sending in Super-Spy Sloan , the one agent Bashir would recognize on sight , to sabotage his work . Super-spy Sloan arrives on DS9 wearing black leather thermal underwear , as usual , even though he should dress in a way that maintains a low profile . Super-Spy Sloan does not go directly to the lab to find and destroy Bashir 's research , but instead goes to Bashir 's quarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bashir ? Did he expect Bashir to destroy his own work ? Was he there to kill Bashir ? If so , why did n't he ? None of Sloan 's or Section 8 's actions here make a damn bit of sense . <p> Query from : Jim McCain Have you approached any of the DS9 production/writing staff to write a novel lately ? <p> Response from : John Ordover There is something in the works . Will let you know when it 's a done deal . <p> Query from : Aaron John , Is there any chance of expounding on the Strange New Worlds Anthologies , by allowing full-length novels ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Stay tuned . John <p> Query from : Bob Are you and Dave Mack interested in writing any Voyager episodes , now that it 's going to be the only Trek in town ? And how about anything outside of Trek ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Dave and I are always in there pitching , and of course always hope something we do will sell. : ) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comics . I 'll keep you informed. : ) <p> Dennis McCarthy poured his heart and soul into this score , the mood at the session was one of joy and bittersweet sorrow , like seeing a old friend one last time . Dennis uses his theme from the episode " The Visitor " for one key scene that brought tears to my eyes ( as well as several other folks at the session ) . <p> The score for the last show is full of emotion and power ( Act 9 is stunning ) . The Final scene is scored with a very moving version of the DS9 . <p> E ! Online ' Trekkies ' ReportChristian ( 2:30 pm CST ) E ! Online has put up an article dealing with ' Trekkies , ' the new documentary directed by Roger Nygard and starring Denise Crosby . The article contains some info on why the name ' Trekkies ' was chosen , instead of the more politically correct ' Trekkers : ' <p> Nygard is not a Trekkie ( or Trekker ) himself , so the early test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one that scared him the most . " That 's the core group and if we piss them off we 're screwed , " he remembers thinking . Fortunately for Nygard , they laughed . And kept their phasers at bay . ( Reaction from fans--good and bad--is available on the movie 's official site : www.trekdoc.com ) <p> The part of the movie that tends to inspire the most ire is the title--and the filmmakers ' decision to dub it Trekkies instead of , say , Trekkers . " We debated long and hard about that , " Nygard says . <p> Happy Birthday Joan Collins ! Christian ( 2:30 pm CST ) Today is the 66th birthday of Joan Collins , perhaps the most remembered guest star Star Trek ever had . She appeared as Kirk 's love interest Edith Keeler on the Original Series episode ' The City on the Edge of Forever , ' which is generally regarded as being the best Star Trek episode ever . However , Collins is much more famous for her role on the long-running television series ' Dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colby Dexter Rowan .

And indeed , most parts of the trilogy reminded me of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ' Lead on , MacDuff ' joke he also used in ' Fallen Heroes . ' <p> Unfortunately , the last hundred pages completely ruined the experience for me , as they seemed incredibly rushed . While that had already been a problem in the previous two books ( continuity errors , lots of typos ) , the situation got even worse in ' The Liberated , ' the last book . Many of the sub-plots were never explained ( the Changeling on the planet , how precisely the Sierra Bravo situation ended ) , or just felt like being written in no more than five minutes ( such as the laughable ' the planet is missing ' epilogue . ) <p> Why could n't they have given Ab Hugh just a few more months to really finish the novel ? The ' Rebels ' trilogy no ranks as one of the worst Trek books I 've ever read , and I 'm not happy at all about it . <p> Precisely one minute after posting the below article dealing with the TV Guide covers , I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather large preview of their DS9 feature . They 've put up no less than three articles - one large one , dealing with the actual end , and two smaller ones , dealing with the history and the future of the show . The first article includes information on the final scene of the show , which will indeed take place in Vic 's Lounge : <p> It is during the scene in Vic 's Lounge that Capt . Benjamin Sisko , played by Avery Brooks , will raise a glass of bubbly and make a moving farewell toast to the crew with whom he has spent the last seven years . It is art beating life to the punch by a mere matter of hours . Needless to say , the filming of this sequence has emotions running high . Almost every star and crew membernot to mention several female extras in spike heels and Jackie Kennedy bouffantshas brought a camera . Between takes , they shoot one another for posterity . Some exchange addresses ; some exchange autographs . <p> The interesting thing is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toast - does that mean he wo n't actually die or join the Prophets in the finale ? Lots of other spoilers can be found in the full article , including the news that Jake Sisko will soon be getting a half-brother or half-sister . The TV Guide issue also contains an article dealing with the future of Trek , which does n't seem to look all that bad , despite the death of a few rumoured projects : <p> " The IMAX movie is not dead , but quite cool on a way-back burner , " says Berman , who also denies the enticing rumors that a young-guns version of Trekset in Starfleet Academyis in the works . " But I am developing other Trek TV projects . " Who 's involved ? Hints Berman : " I find it hard to believe we 've seen the last of all the DS9 cast . " <p> As far as I know , this is the first time Berman has openly said he 's developing new Trek TV projects . I find it interesting he does n't call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ' idea might actually be in development at Paramount , though this is just wishful me speculating .

I 'm just curious : ) <p> John De Lancie : Yes , often times people will set up their little , or I should say their 900mm lens on a tripod and make you think you 're in some kind of photoshoot .

Christian ( 2:26 pm CST ) Over the past few weeks , it has been rumoured that the U.S.S. Equinox ( the Federation ship Voyager will encounter in the season finale ) would be a Nova-class starship . Now that Star Trek Interactive ! has published the trailers for ' Equinox , ' it turns out the ship might actually be a long-lost brother of the U.S.S. Defiant ! <p> If you look at the above image and the image here to the right ( both of which I slightly enhanced so you can see it better ) , you 'll see the U.S.S. Equinox , as it was shown in the trailer available at Star Trek Interactive ! Both images clearly show the cut-out space at the nose of the ship , and the size of the ship in relation the bridge module . <p> Now take a look at this blueprint - does it look in any way familiar ? It should if you took a careful look at the above screenshots . What this blueprint actually shows is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Star Trek DS9 Technical Manual . ' According to that book , this was how the U.S.S. Defiant would originally have looked , in the initial proposal by the ' Advanced Starship Design Bureau ' ( in the Star Trek Universe , that is ) Below are some of the specifications of the Pathfinder , as found in the Tech Manual : <p> The study vehicle , designated NXP-2365WP/T , was being considered as a fast torpedo attack ship for high-warp penetrations of threat defenses . This Defiant pathfinder would have mounted six torpedo launchers , four in the primary hull and two in the engineering hull , capable of firing photon and quantum torpedoes at speeds up to Warp 9.982 . <p> According to the book , the Pathfinder design was abandoned after the Borg threat required a more compact vessel . Many people ( or at least I myself ) thought that the Pathfinder design would only be appearing in the DS9 Tech Manual , but , judging from the above screenshots , it may actually be used in the Voyager season finale . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warp drives look different ) , but in total the ships look remarkably similar . <p> Of course , now we 're left to wonder why the creative staff decided to go with the Pathfinder design . In the Trek universe , it would have about the same technological capabilities as Voyager , while we originally heard that the Equinox would be a lot less advanced than Voyager . Maybe the reason is ( as I saw someone remark at the SolarFlare forums ) that a lot of fans already created their own Nova-class designs , and Paramount wanted to avoid any allegations of theft . Or maybe they just liked the design - I myself rather like the cut-out thing as well . Hopefully we 'll get some answers to these questions soon . <p> Once again TV Guide has gone for the collectibles crowd with its new issue -- a four-version cover heralding the end of ST:DS9 and its two-hour finale , " What You Leave Behind .

' Except for Jake Sisko not appearing together with his father on the cover , she even managed to report us the correct cover images ! As you can imagine , I 'm rather happy about this - thanks Faith ! <p> Klingon Academy is a fully 3D space combat simulator where you take the role of the captain of a large ship . You can also take control of gunnery stations in combat or leave it to the AI . The graphics looked quite good , although the interface seemed on the complex side for your typical space combat simulator . Even so , this might be the first Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big time . The story line is a prequel to the movie Star Trek : The Undiscovered Country and Christopher Plummer reprises his role as General Chang . Your CO is Chang , and the first part of the game puts you in the simulator to learn your job , thus the name of the game . Overall the game looked like it had a lot of potential . Along with the campaign a fully featured mission builder is included , giving the game more long term value . Klingon Academy is due this July . <p> Cinescape : Have you heard any talk about incorporating DS9 characters into the movie series in some way ? <p> deBoer : There 's certainly been no mention of anything as far as we all know . There 's no DS9 movie , there 's no tying the characters into another show and the next Star Trek feature wo n't be for a few more years , if they 're smart . <p> Two more questions can be found in the full interview written by Steve Hockensmith , while even more can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Jeff Vice , a ( the ? ) movie critic of the ' Deseret News ' awards the documenteray 3 stars in his review , saying that the film might well be interpreted as offensive to Trek fans , and talking about Trek star Kate Mulgrew being as odd as her fans . <p> -Steven Mazey at the Ottawa Citizen calls the movie ' mean ' and ' cruel to Trek fans , ' and awards it no more than 2 stars in his review .

Christian ( 2:19 pm CST ) Over the past few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy claiming to be a Paramount insider . Apparently this guy was thinking that I was completely brainless , as he started telling me about a new series which will ' definitely ' be launched in September 200 . According to this guy , it will be set 200 years from now , and it will star ( wait for it ... ) Leonardo DiCaprio as the new captain ! <p> Purely for amusement purposes , I sent him back an e-mail asking for more details , which he promptly provided - apparently DiCaprio 's first officer would be the grandson of Spock , and the timeship would also have something to do with the series . When I finally told him I did n't believe a word of what he was saying , he told me " If you do n't  beleive me and print this , I 'll send it to another sight !

On the show , Stern and Shatner apparently talked about his new book ' Get A Life ! , ' his Priceline.com stocks , and his new wife . Apparently Shatner even performed a song together with the rapper ' Rated R. ' Find the full report here . Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for pointing me to this . <p> Well - Season 5 is now done ! Just going to help with the DS9 final ep , and then it will be time for some much deserved R and R. I ca n't wait . Although it is very cool to be working on the final DS9 , considering I was there for the first episode , and through the first 5 seasons , and now I get to do the final show . This makes me happy . <p> When asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be done for ' What You Leave Behind : ' <p> It dubs Friday , Monday , Tues and Wed . Right now there is a massive amount of ADR Automated Dialogue Replacement , ' looping ' - TT to cut . I really kind of like the last ep , but it also makes me sad . I worked on that show for so long , it seems weird to see it go . For a few minor spoilers that everyone has probably already heard , scroll down . <p> In his full message he also provided some spoiler information for ' What You Leave Behind , ' but most of that has also been published on the net before ( mostly some info on what all the characters will be doing after the series ) .

Christian ( 1:55 pm CST ) Julia Houston , the Star Trek guide at the Mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Internet Good For Star Trek ? ' According to Houston , the internet might not always be good for the people actually creating the show : <p> I want to say , " Of course Star Trek benefits from the Internet . " But the reason I want to say that is that I , like you , am a fan of the show . For fans -- Trekkers , Trekkies , and just interested by-standers -- the Internet helps our enjoyment of the show tremendously . ... For us , life is good . <p> But over the two years that I 've been the Star Trek Guide , it 's become quite clear to me that in a few ways , the Internet has made some things more difficult for the producers of the show . Now , that does n't mean we have to worry about it . The producers make the money and have the power . Dealing with the fans is , after all , their job . I 'm not talking about this to dredge up pity for TPTB . I just see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what people online , in my humble opinion , do best . <p> Eon Reviews ' Get A Life'Christian ( 1:55 pm CST ) Self-proclaimed Shatner fan Jeff Bond at Eon has put up a review of ' Get A Life ! ' , the new autobiographical book by Shatner . Bond does n't take the usual route of just making fun of Shatner ( which , I admit , I myself have been guilt of as well ) , but instead praises Shatner for finally making peace with his fans : <p> Eventually Shatner makes his peace with the fans ( and having observed his performance with the other ' Four Captains ' at Grand Slam last year , he genuinely seemed to be enjoying himself ) , and if GET A LIFE never really comes up with a satisfactory explanation for the appeal of STAR TREK other than the inevitable " ... I think it 's Gene Roddenberry 's optimistic vision of the future blah blah blah ... " well , at least Shatner gave it his best shot . As for me , why do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's one crazy possibility : maybe I just like that darned William Shatner . <p> In his rather interesting review , Bond ends up awarding the book a B- . <p> I 'm noticing a trend here . First we get put on standby with episodes that carefully stack the pieces while providing interesting events but also intensely bottled frustration , and then we 're permitted an explosive release of tension that leaves us reeling . <p> " Tacking into the Wind , " which might 've also been aptly named " For the Homeland , " tells the suspenseful and particularly well-realized multi-tiered story of people facing conflict in their own organizations . How they deal with these conflicts could determine the fate of everything they stand for . It also reveals where they 've come from and where they 're likely headed . <p> " Tacking " is the best type of action show--one with a strong character undercurrent and ideological core such that we genuinely care about what happens on the screen . We 've got the action elements here--dangerous missions and physical fights--but they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to several ends . Those ends prove quite satisfying . <p> This was probably the most disappointing two-month period Voyager has ever seen . After a very strong February Sweeps , March and April saw Voyager suffer a nervous breakdown . <p> ... <p> Every episode during this period was either down or level from last year . " Think Tank " was the one show which managed to stay near last year , tying " Omega Directive " at a 3.7 . Considering how often Voyager was besting its year-ago marks earlier this year , this is quite disappointing . Considering these ratings , it looks fairly certain that May will also see a drop off from last year 's May Sweeps performance . <p> Voyager 's season was looking extremely promising up until this period . Shows were regularly defeating their year-ago counterparts and Voyager was generally on the rise . However , these last two months have marred an otherwise excellent season . With these consistently low marks , things are not looking good for May and the season 's average in comparison with last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first-run episode and " Juggernaut " set a new all-time low for any Voyager rating including reruns . There was one bright spot in " Think Tank " proving that Voyager has the potential to return to its better marks from earlier this season , but that potential has n't been exploited since " Think Tank " aired . <p> A much more detailed analysis can be found in the full report . The Info Database also has info on the national ratings for ' Relativity ' and the overnight ratings for ' Warhead ' , but as the Universe already reported on this before I 'm not quoting anything from those reports . <p> Shatner AppearancesChristian ( 1:52 pm CST ) The Events Calendar of the William Shatner Connection lists no less than 4 appearances by William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) today , most of them held to promote his new book ' Get A Life !

Filming will begin in Toronto mid-July . <p> Frakes To Compete With VoyagerChristian ( 1:50 pm CST ) The people at the Daily Sci-Fi have posted some rather disturbing news - apparently WB have put their new ' Roswell High ' series in exactly the same time slot occupied by Voyager on UPN , Wednesdays from 9 to 10 . Roswell High is an SF series about a pair of alien teens at a certain New Mexico high school , directed by Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roswell High instead of Voyager - that 's the last thing the series needs ! <p> In the interest of integrity for all of the remaining Regional Preliminary tournaments , we found it necessary to issue some clarifications to the rules regarding the advancement of players to their Regional Championships . <p> Shatner At CannesChristian ( 1:49 pm CST ) With the link apparently being that both men are womanizers , the Los Angeles Times has put up an article chronicling the experiences of Playboy 's Hugh Hefner and Star Trek 's William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) at the Cannes movie festival . The report contains some info on the new ' Free Enterprise ' movie , in which Shatner stars : <p> Regent Entertainment , which produced the Oscar-winning " Gods and Monsters " and is releasing " Free Enterprise " in the U.S. , hopes the movie will get a boost from the frenzy over " Star Wars : Episode I The Phantom Menace .

And so does he . " How someone is successful in selling something that is not driven by a $20-million star , I do n't know , " he admitted . " All I do know is that I and many people like me have striven for years to put together independent films . And I 'm now in one done by two young men who 've never done it before . It 's kind of humiliating and disconcerting at the same time . " <p> Hey , it got him to Cannes , right ? " It 's an ironic twist , " he said . " And I see it , totally .

If , however , you 're indeed going to see the movie today , and you 'd like to write a review of it , I 'd be more than happy to post it here at TrekToday - just send in your reviews ! <p> ' Trekkies ' ReviewsChristian ( 1:48 pm CST ) Today 's listing of new reviews of the new Trek fan documentary ' Trekkies , ' presented by Denise Crosby and directed by Roger Nygard : <p> -Randall King of the Winnipeg Sun points out the inherent contradiction between the two primary directives of the film - to show that Trekkies are actually normal people on the one hand , and to have a good laugh at the human capacity for obsession on the other hand . For the rest King 's review does n't really contain anything new . <p> -Brian McTavish of the Kansas City Star ends his review by pointing out what is indeed a major problem for Trek fans with the movie : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good about being used as unwitting comedy fodder . ' Fortunately , his Kansas colleague James Hart , on the other hand , is very positive about Star Trek , comparing Trek 's thinking heroes to Star Wars ' action heroes . <p> -Stephen Hunter at the Washington Post amusingly begins by calling Star Trek ' one of the five major world religions , ' and then goes on with the standard talk about how obsessed Trek fans are . The review ends with an interesting note , as Hunter complains about William Shatner not being in the movie , while he most certainly is . Are there perhaps two cuts circulating around the country ? The Washington Post people also put up another review , written by Michael O'Sullivan . <p> -The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is n't that positive about the documentary , awarding it no more than 2.5 stars in its review . <p> -Gene Seymour 's LA Times review does n't list William Shatner either - does anyone have any more info on this they 'd like to share ? Did anyone already see Shatner in the documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up an excellent review , in which he basically sums up my own point of view - good film , but not that good for Trek fans . Eon is also the site that provided me with the movie poster , thanks go out to them for that . <p> -Lastly , Sci-Fi Weekly reviewer Patrick Lee has put up a review of the documentary , calling it hysterically funny . The review contains the below quote , which I thought would be a fitting end to this list of ' Trekkies ' reviews : <p> The Trek actors and producers in the film are clearly tiptoeing around the subject so as not to offend the fans . I wondered how many of the Trekkies themselves will react to their depictions . But I found it especially ironic to be watching the documentary in a Paramount Studios auditorium surrounded by industry hangers-on , many of whom laughed a little too loudly at the fans that pay for it all . <p> Insurrection Rental Video ResultsChristian ( 1:48 pm CST ) The Video Software Dealers Association just announced the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' Insurrection ' debuted at no. 3 .

Well , not so much Kirk , as his older , chubbier alter ego , William Shatner , who is , quite frankly , sick of being pestered by Star Trek fans and wishes they would all just get a life . Shatner , approaching his 69th birthday , is the unlikely idol of millions of people , mostly men , in their 20s and 30s who still marvel at his command of the tricorders and transporters on board the Star Ship Enterprise .

Then , at a stirring ceremony at the Origins game convention ( that 's in Columbus ) this July Fourth weekend , the plaques get handed out , and a grand time is had by all . <p> This episode will be remembered as the one where Bashir and O'Brien confessed their love for one another ... seriously , even non-slash fans had to be affected by that passionate declaration of friendship just before what they thought would be their deaths . It was quite moving considering that their attachment has been a topic of jokes for more than three years - I have never forgotten the scene in " Hippocratic Oath " where Miles wished aloud that Keiko could be more like Julian . It 's annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , but at least they were admitting to the failing and finding a way to integrate it into their lives in the end . Their chemistry moved this episode along far better than the plot , which got that predictable still-a-dream sequence just like the recent " Field Trip " on The X-Files and " Waking Moments " on Voyager . <p> More ' Trekkies ' ReviewsChristian ( 2:42 pm CST ) There are so many of them , I really ca n't quote pieces from all of them . If you do want to read them all , below is a short list of the ones I could find : <p> -The Boston Phoenix reviews the documentary , with just two paragraphs and not much new info . <p> -Bill Gallo actually has quite a few things to say in his Dallas Observer review and , while not all of his comments are that positive about Trek fans , he does raise a few interesting questions . <p> -Ted Anthony in his Nando Times review also appears rather critical about Trek fans , though his review too is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be appearing over the next few days . <p> Jam ! Showbiz ' Trekkies ' ReviewChristian ( 2:42 pm CST ) Jam ! has reprinted two reviews of the new ' Trekkies ' documentary , which first appeared in the Toronto Sun and the Calgary Sun , respectively . Toronto 's Bob Thompson begins by comparing ' Trekkies ' to that other sci-fi release you may have heard of : <p> Talk about the elephant and the mouse . A $450,000 documentary called Trekkies is being released tomorrow opposite the $115-million super-picture , Star Wars : Episode I The Phantom Menace . <p> The irony is not lost on either host-producer Denise Crosby or director Roger Nygard . " The funny thing is , Trekkies is opening in about 330 theatres , the same as Star Wars in 1977 , " reports Nygard during a Four Seasons Hotel interview . <p> Louis Hobson 's review for the Calgary sun contains an interesting news item about William Shatner : <p> " William Shatner proved to be the most difficult and least co-operative of all the cast members , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him , " says Crosby . Shatner eventually allowed the camera crew to film him during an appearance at a meeting of his biggest fan club in California . <p> " At the last minute he insisted on being paid , but then reneged when we started to pack up because he would have had to explain it to his fans . " <p> Star Trek Cookbook ReviewChristian ( 2:41 pm CST ) The LA Times has put up a review of both the ' Star Wars Cookbook ' and the ' Star Trek Cookbook , ' two recent books which gave fans dozens of special SF-based recipes . While the Star Wars cookbook is apparently rather humourous , this is n't the case with the Star Trek edition : <p> Trekkers seem less inclined to play with their food . The " Star Trek Cookbook " ( Pocket Books , $20 ) by Ethan Phillips and William J. Birnes takes a more scholarly approach--think of Paula Wolfert making a guest appearance on " Star Trek : Voyager . " Neelix , the Voyager 's chief cook , describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down to eat something I could n't name , could n't recognize , biting into a new , alive , exotic taste . " <p> The book includes recipes for the foods eaten by characters from every Star Trek series and movie . The recipes are accompanied by Neelix 's descriptions of hard-to-find local ingredients like Fargonian finger apples , Nezu candy-tufted mud fungus , Bolian tingle butter and a " tomato with see-through skin and seeds that sing " as well as suggestions for substitutions . ( If you ca n't find crushed Bothan brain fluid , soy sauce will do as well . ) There are also extensive notes on how recipes--like one for a chocolate cake that bakes for nine years and is made with nuts from a planet that is several lifetimes away--were adapted for 20th century Earth kitchens . <p> Nanotechnology A RealityChristian ( 2:41 pm CST ) According to an article by AP 's Lauran Neergaard , nanotechnology has recently become reality , after researchers from the University of Michigan discovered a new drug which works rather a lot like Star Trek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like science fiction : Microscopic oil droplets protect patients from germs and viruses by fusing with the dangerous bugs and causing them essentially to explode . University of Michigan scientists , hunting ways to protect soldiers from biological warfare , say they have created just such a drug . It can eradicate deadly anthrax within an hour of contact , and promises to be so non-toxic to humans that one day it might be possible to decontaminate germ-laden food . <p> Dr. James Baker , creator of these drug droplets so tiny they have been dubbed nano-bombs , ' ' added some to a sample of cholera viewed through a microscope . A few minutes later , All that 's left here is debris . The remarkable thing is this happens almost immediately , ' ' Baker said . <p> UPN To Focus On Young Male AudienceChristian ( 2:41 pm CST ) UPN , the United States ' least succesful nationwide television network , has just announced its new fall schedule , which incorporates quite a few major changes . The major new addition to its lineup is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursdays , bringing viewers no less than 2 continuous hours of wrestling . <p> Other changes include the Thursday night movie shifting a day later to Friday , and now being called the ' UPN Blockbuster Shockwave Cinema . ' Lastly , their Tuesday night ' ethnic comedy block ' moves to Monday , while Dilbert will move to Tuesdays . According to Jenny Hontz of the Daily Variety , ' UPN 's schedule clearly represents the shift away from middle-American programming that categorized last fall 's schedule and back toward the original strategy of attracting young men . ' <p> On the Star Trek front , nothing will change , as Wednesdays will still first feature the ' Seven Days ' drama and then Voyager at 9:00pm . I do have to wonder , though , if the ' young male ' focus will also have an effect on Voyager - I certainly hope we wo n't be getting even more focus on Seven of Nine next year .

The review begins by introducing Trek to the Israeli audience : <p> For a TV series whose first pilot was rejected by NBC as " too cerebral " and which received mixed reviews when it was finally launched in 1966 , Star Trek has n't done too badly . Reruns of the original three-season show are still seen in more than 100 countries , and the shows have been translated into dozens of languages ; every month , a Star Trek novel is published by Pocket Books ( 63 million of these are already in print ) . <p> A query to an Internet search engine with the words " Star Trek " dug up over 90,000 mentions on the World Wide Web , including an official site at www.startrek.com ; Star Trek conventions are held every weekend of every year in at least four US cities ; a Purdue University study in 1993 found that US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other source , and a wide variety of spinoffs , including three dramatic TV series , an animated series , numerous feature films and consumer products have created a financial empire .

The report contains Jeri Ryan 's views on several interesting things , such as homosexuality , Voyager movies and her own future on Trek . Take a look at her rather mysterious comments about that last issue : <p> I have a three year contract . The third year is season six . There will be seven seasons . At least seven . There may come more after that . <p> Find the full report here , thanks go out to Captain Clerk for posting about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock'Christian ( 2:04 pm CST ) TV Guide has put up a small article dealing with William Shatner 's upcoming guest appearance on ' 3rd Rock From The Sun , ' NBC 's comedy series . Take a look at how the article begins : <p> Courageous Captain Kirk of Star Trek saved the universe from aliensnow , he 's becoming one . William Shatner will play Big Giant Head , the often mentioned but never seen extraterrestrial supreme commander on NBC 's 3rd Rock From the Sun ( May 25 , 8 pm/ET ) . Big Giant Head arrives on Earth in the guise of a human to check out his alien expedition and quickly succumbs to mortal pleasures . " I 'm totally drunk out of my head , and I lust after women , " Shatner reveals . " I also get to sing and dance . That was great , because I 'm a song-and-dance man at heart . " <p> The full article has some more info on the Big Giant Head character Shatner will be playing , but also has Shatner talking about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to this . <p> DEEP-SIXED There was no Klingon gagh or Vulcan plomeek soup on hand , and those were only two of the signs that the April 22 wrap party for Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , at the Skybar in L.A. 's Mondrian hotel , was a decidedly earthbound affair . For one thing , some of the cast and crew used the occasion to express their disappointment that during their show 's seven-year run , Paramount never supported it with the marketing muscle afforded siblings Star Trek : The Next Generation and Star Trek : Voyager . " There was definitely the middle-child syndrome , " says DS9 exec producer Ira Behr . " But the upside was that the suits left us alone and we were able to take some creative risks . " <p> Then there was the rather earthy scene that inadvertently interrupted festivities : As cocreator Rick Berman stood in the hotel courtyard to give one final speech , gazes wandered elsewhere . Specifically , to a window on the fourth floor , where an amorous and rather exhibitionistic couple prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pointing and whistles , one partygoer summed it up best : " Now , that 's what I call the final frontier . " <p> The final rating for Relativity is in , and Voyager got once again a bad rating . Voyager got a 3.3 and was nr. 91 . <p> ... <p> The strange thing was that the overnight rating for this episode was up 0.5 , but it still only got a final rating that was up 0.1 . I have n't got the complete rating list , so I do n't know if Voyager was 6th or 5th . Tune in later for more on this . <p> The full report also contains some comments on the Voyager trailers , which the Universe thinks are the reason for the bad ratings . <p> The event will be held at Congregation Rodeph Sholom , located at 7 West 83rd Street at Central Park West , in Manhattan . Tickets may be purchased in advance for $18 through the 92nd Street Y Box Office , 1395 Lexington Avenue , NY , NY 10128 or by phoning Y-Charge ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be sold on the night of the event at Congregation Rodeph Sholom . <p> The 92nd Street Y actually has an official web site , but no additional information about this can be found there . I found this info at the Shatner Event Calendar , which also lists a few other upcoming Shatner appearances . Tomorrow , for instance , he 'll be appearing on three talk shows , including ' Late Night with Conan O'Brien . ' <p> Captain Kirk has again left starship command for the microphone stand . Shatner sings " No Tears for Caesar " as a duet with rapper Rated R , formerly of Tupac Shakur 's Thug Life Posse , on the soundtrack to the feature film " Free Enterprise . " The film , starring Shatner and Eric McCormack , will be released June 4 . The soundtrack is due out on June 15 . A secret bonus track by Shatner is also included . <p> Ira Steven Behr Chat TranscriptChristian ( 2:01 pm CST ) Surprisingly fast , the Continuum has put up the transcript of yesterday 's chat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat reads like having been a very emotional one , with many people thanking him for the great job he did , and so it 's hard to pick out the three most interesting quotes - they 're all worth reading . Still , below you 'll find a small sample : <p> Charles A. Salter , N.C. asks : I 'm really going to miss new DS9 episodes , I really enjoy DS9 a lot , and just to say thanks for DS9 a great show , Do you plan on staying with Star Trek in any capacity , if not I 'll be disappointed . <p> Ira Steven Behr : No one has approached me with continuing my relationship with the Star Trek franchise . Certainly , if the series felt right to me and felt like it was going to take chances and not play it safe , I 'd have some interest . But I think there 's a very complicated relationship between DS9 and the powers that be . I think they 're very proud of the show creatively , but I think they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could never be sure what kind of wacky thing I would do on the next show . So it 's really kind of up in the air right now . But I really like this nice feedback . I usually come here to have Guy Vardaman say nice things about me . <p> Michael303 asks : Hello Ira . Many thanks to you and the staff for seven great seasons . I 'll miss it . Despite all the rumours , why has n't there been serious discussion for a movie or mini-series . DS9 would fit greatly into the genre of a first class mini-series . <p> Ira Steven Behr : I suppose it 's possible that DS9 will have some kind of after life in the future . I think part of that decision will be based on how the finale does , what the fan response is , but like I said earlier , the sets , for the most part , have been torn down , which I have to take as a kind of an ominous sign . But I think what needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 176 episodes . We have a tendency in this country to always want more . It 's like people used to talk about why did the Beatles break up ? Why could n't they stay together for another 10 years ? I think it would be better to be thinking , : " Hey , is n't it great , look at all the wonderful music they made while they worked together . " The Sex Pistols only recorded one album , but they said virtually everything they had to say in that one album , and they changed the face of pop music in many different ways . So let 's try to concentrate on what DS9 was able to do , rather than mourning some alternate universe where it could have done more , or existed in another format . <p> Jam asks : Did you have any story ideas for the " final chapter " which did not get implemented ? <p> Ira Steven Behr : Well , once again , I 'd rather concentrate on what we were able to jam into that final episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ... there was a part of me that did want to end the show on Benny Russell , the character Sisko played in " Far Beyond the Stars " At one point , Benny , now an old man , was going to die of natural causes and as he died we would go back to the station and end the series in the middle of a conversation between Quark and Kira , as if with his death , they cease to exist . The other idea was to have Benny Russell come to Deep Space Nine and in the midst of some kind of crisis suddenly realize that there was a camera pointed at him , and walk off the set through the soundstages , outside into the Paramount street , and I wanted to follow Benny Russell up to Rick Berman 's office , where he would tell Rick that the series was over . But I think what we wind up doing is pretty cool too . <p> Again , I strongly recommend reading the full chat .

Christian ( 1:58 pm CST ) Sorry for being so late , but less than 4 hours ago the Dutch government fell , and , as you can imagine , that is taking up quite a bit of my attention at the moment . Fortunately I had already prepared most of today 's headlines before the post-resignation parliamentary debate started , so I will at least be able to do an update today . However , I probably wo n't be able to answer any mail today - if you sent me mail , I have n't forgotten about you , and I 'll be answering tomorrow ! <p> For those of you who are interested , this article describes the problems as they existed a few hours before the actual resignation , and this article describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in my political views , I have to say I find this an incredibly sad day . Not only has the government fallen , it also means that the introduction of the referendum in the Netherlands has been set back by at least 5 years , and that is a huge blow for the Dutch democratic system . In light of that , though , I strongly support the decision by coalition partner Democrats ' 66 to leave the government - the party ( which I 'm a member of ) would have become totally unbelievable had it not done so . <p> Star Trek Insurrection , which was scheduled to open in Argentina in April 22 , will instead go direct-to-video in that country . Argentina is the biggest Trek market in South America ( all the 4 series are broadcast in Argentina ) and this is the first time a Trek movie is not released in Argentina . Likewise , Insurrection only played in Brazil for 2 weeks last february , making the poorly Trek box-office in brazilian theatres . <p> Well , I do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Gustavo Leao for reporting this . <p> Here we are , back again .

' As the press releases and the trailers both called it by its new title , ' Extreme Measures , ' my guess is they 're still using the new name . <p> New ' Jammer 's Reviews'Christian ( 1:18 pm CST ) Slightly delayed , Jamahl Epsicokhan at Star Trek Hypertext has put up reviews for DS9 's ' When It Rains ... ' and Voyager 's ' 11:59 , ' both of which aired somewhat over a week ago . In his ' When It Rains ... ' review he starts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to come : <p> Someone wrote me an e-mail saying these " Final Chapter " episodes seem to be coming off as 90 percent setup and only about 10 percent riveting stories . I find that 's an interesting take on the matter--and although I personally think it 's a somewhat harsh assessment ( setup itself can be riveting ) , I certainly can see the argument . <p> " When it Rains ... " seems to be a good example of this mindset . This episode offers more plot into the mix , but the feel of the episode is somewhat off-kilter . It 's probably the most frustrating yet of the " Final Chapter " episodes , because it moves along for an hour and then suddenly halts in its tracks , with virtually no resolution . If you were like me and were n't watching the clock , you might 've been blindsided by the suddenness of the " executive producers " credit appearing . <p> Issues of multi-part structure aside , " When it Rains ... " has a somewhat excessive title . The title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abyss of Despair , perhaps for the last time before the series heads into final wrap-up . I do n't think that was the case nor the intention . What is the case , rather , is that we have more setup of plot and character directions , with some interesting new revelations--as the elements continue to pile up . <p> He then goes on to analyze all the various plot lines and ultimately awards the episode with 3 out of 4 stars , as you can read in the full review . This is also the same score Voyager 's ' 11:59 ' receives , full reasons for that can be found here . <p> Ira Steven Behr Chat TodayChristian ( 1:15 pm CST ) Today at the special time of 03:30pm Pacific Time , the Continuum will be hosting a live chat with DS9 Executive Producer Ira Steven Behr . He 'll be answering your questions about the final DS9 episodes , and will quite probably also give some info on his future projects . If you want to know how you can participate , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile , the Continuum will be hosting a live chat with John DeLancie , most famous for his role as Q on the various modern Star Trek series . Advance questions for him can also already be submitted . <p> Only one word can describe ST 's ratings on BBC2 for this week - owch ! Both TNG and DS9 suffered badly at the hands of the snooker championships . Even Scotty could n't save TNG 's " Relics " from getting the worst audience figure this year ( yes , 1999 , not Season 6 ) - 2.28m . If you look at this week 's updated graphs , this dip in ratings seems to be repeating itself every four weeks . Still on BBC2 , DS9 made no " Progress " ( pun intended ) , as it was yet again unranked - therefore getting a rating lower than 1.78m , probably the lowest this year too . <p> Fortunately , Sky saved the week with an excellent rating for Voyager . The second episode of the season , " Drone " , was beaten only by top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ER a run for its money with 680,000 viewers compared to ER 's 690,000 . Voyager beated The X-Files by another 10,000 viewers . <p> A full listing of all the ratings , plus graphs showing the weekly performance , can be found at the Ratings page . <p> Patrick Stewart NewsChristian ( 1:14 pm CST ) The Continuum has put up a news report detailing exactly what Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) is currently doing , now that he 's not playing the role of Starfleet Captain anymore : <p> On the musical front , Stewart will be narrating " A Soldier 's Tale " by Stravinsky June 17- 19 and 23 with the San Francisco Symphony at its home venue in that city . Next , on July 21 , he narrates for mezzo-soprano Susan Graham and pianist Emanuel Ax the Boston-area Tanglewood Music Festival production of Strauss ' " Enoch Arden , " a melodrama after Alfred Lord Tennyson . Two days later he will narrate a second Strauss production . <p> May 21st , he receives an honorary doctoral degree from the venerable Juilliard School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched by your artistry and vision , " the school mentioned in its letter to Stewart in announcing the honor .

Also this summer , listen for Stewart 's narration of a documentary on the Panchen Lama for the International Campaign for Tibet , to be released this summer . <p> Lastly , Stewart will soon be honoured with a special wax statue in Madame Tussaud 's Wax Museum in Las Vegas and London . Find the original report here . <p> ' Birth Of The Federation ' SurpriseChristian ( 1:13 pm CST ) The Trek Gaming Alliance has just posted the rather surprising news that ' Birth of the Federation , ' the upcoming turn-based strategy game from Microprose , will feature the Defiant- and Sovereign-Class starships ! The reason this was n't mentioned before is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the game , but their inclusion has been planned since day one . <p> Jonathan Frakes Directs UFO ComedyChristian ( 1:12 pm CST ) AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz is reporting that Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) is co-producing Roswell High , a 1950s-era comedy about three teenage aliens who survived the legendary UFO crash in Roswell , New Mexico and went to high school there . The show originally started as a project for Fox , but will now air on the WB network . Besides Frakes , executive producers will include Jason Katims of ' The Pallbearer ' and Lisa Olin , who was Frakes ' assistant on ' Star Trek : First Contact . ' This is n't the first time Frakes has been involved in a Roswell-related project - a few years ago he also presented the ' Beyond Belief : Alien Autopsy ' specials on Fox . <p> More On ' Gene Roddenberry 's Starship'Christian ( 1:12 pm CST ) I 'm currently kicking myself for not remembering this myself , but ' Michael Marek ' at Cinescape has put up some extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , which will feature a character named Dylan Hunt : <p> Dylan Hunt was the lead character in three made-for-TV movies in the 1970s made as pilots for a new Roddenberry TV series , ... in which astronaut Dylan Hunt is accidentally stuck in suspended animation in Carlsbad Caverns and wakes up hundreds of years in the future , after a nuclear war . The planet has divided into many small states with many different cultural mores . Hunt gets tied up with a group called PAX which is working for peace and understanding . They have a futuristic " subshuttle " world-wide subway system that allows them to get around . Roddenberry indicated that with this concept , he could have Star Trek 's " new civilizations " all while remaining on Earth of the future . <p> The main plot of Genesis II is mutants with two navels who seem to be good guys but are really bad guys . The head mutant was played by Mariette Hartley . Hunt was played by Alex Cord . ... It sounds like Gene Roddenberry 's Starship is a reworking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to on a single planet . <p> Indeed , David Alexander 's ' Star Trek Creator ' mentions there are still fifteen Genesis II scripts lying around , written by Roddenberry himself , so there should be enough story material left . On the other hand , the Genesis II Dylan hunt was a NASA scientist , who had ' woken up ' again after 154 years of suspended animation , while the ' Starship ' Dylan Hunt will apparently be the Captain of a ship of Galactic trouble-shooters . Also , Genesis II was set just after an atomic war on Earth , while Dylan Hunt ' leaves Earth to study the far reaches of the universe , ' and ' discover worlds that are vastly different from the humanistic and civilized society he left behind . ' I guess we 'll just have to wait and see how it turns out . <p> If , however , you have your own ideas on how the series should turn out , a special thread about this has been created at the Trek BBS - let the world know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pm CST ) Raven programmer Rick Johnson mentioned in his . plan file yesterday that he 's posted some E3 pictures he took while he was attending last week 's Electronic Entertainment Expo . Although most of the several dozen pictures he 's posted do n't have anything to do with Voyager , about five of them still show places such as the Activision Star Trek area or the actual Voyager game being demoed . You can find the full list of pictures by going here . Meanwhile , our reporter Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga is still hard at work writing up his own exclusive preview of the Voyager game , which should go up very soon indeed at our special E3 site . <p> The line of fans awaiting the May 19 premiere of Star Wars Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace ' ' at Mann 's Chinese Theater is steadily creeping toward the offices of DVD EXPRESS , just steps away on Hollywood Boulevard . <p> So , DVD EXPRESS ( http : //www.dvdexpress.com ) , the largest online video retailer , has enlisted its new neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special Camp Star Wars ' ' tribute to these Jedi stalwarts . DVD EXPRESS has helped to arm the laptop computers of the fans in line with DVD-ROM drives as well as provide them with scores of DVD movies to watch while they wait . <p> One of the reviewers was Danny Kovoloff , who was asked to review the DVD of ' Star Trek : First Contact . ' Check out some of his comments about the movie : <p> Q : How 's the acting ? A : Acting was about par for the Star Trek series . They played the characters they know , so the acting was fine . <p> Q : And the audio/video quality ... what 's your feeling there ? A : Audio/video quality was fine . I have it at home and watch it on a Dolby Surround system and it sounds very , very nice . <p> You can find Danny 's full review by going here , while the press release describing the actual hiring by DVD Express can be found here at Yahoo ! <p> Today on TVChristian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Time , the SciFi Channel will be showing ' The Corbomite Maneuver , ' which was actually the first regular Original Series episode ever filmed . <p> -Tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , British Sky One will be showing the rather good DS9 episode ' Whispers . ' <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 1:07 pm CST ) At the rate we 're progressing now , we could very well reach 200 registered members before the month is over ! Together with all the unregistered posters , everyone is participating actively in the discussions at the Trek BBS , talking about topics such as the following three : <p> -What are your thoughts on the recent announcement that Kevin ' Hercules ' Sorbo will be starring in a Roddenberry series ? <p> -Star Trek : The Past Future --- Welcome Aboard USS Selina NCC-25796-A is a Chinese homepage introducing Star Trek , made by a Chinese living in Hong Kong .

Paris gets a little jealous , wondering if he needs to go to Red Alert , or even Yellow as a result . ; ) <p> Harry Kim calls Paris " pastrami on rye " as a joke . <p> Note that this info is either already a few months old , from an incomplete script , or not fully complete for a completely different reason .

Major thanks go out to Faith for this - let 's hope she 'll have some season six info soon : - ) . <p> Tom Paris SpeaksChristian ( 2:21 pm CST ) The British ' Star Trek Monthly Magazine ' recently interviewed Robert Duncan McNeill , and the Founders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Link . The interview contains the rather interesting news that the Trek Typecasting problem seems to be over : <p> " The world of Star Trek , within the entertainment industry , is something of a deserted island , we certainly are a recognisable brand and viewers around the world know us very well , but I think it 's very surprising that people in the industry we work in do n't look at Star Trek actors with a whole lot appreciation ... it does n't mean the same thing as being on Friends or ER for five years , and I think the disparity is frustrating . " <p> " I get really annoyed when I go for a meeting and the casting director or the producer or whatever says , ' So , tell me about yourself . What have you been doing ? ' And they have no idea . I 'll say , ' I 've been on Star Trek for five years , ' and they 're like , ' Oh wow , I have n't seen that ! ' . But you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really care what people in the industry think that much , because I know what we 've done is great work . And when you look at the whole picture , I 'm much happier that I 've been able to do Star Trek : Voyager than most of the other shows I could think of . It 's been a really great experience . " <p> " So I 'm very grateful to have been able to be a part of it . And hopefully we 'll be able to do it for a lot longer . " <p> More is to be found in the full interview , including comments on Voyager 's fifth season , the continued development of Tom Paris and the relationship between Tom and B'Elanna . <p> Cynics Corner Reviews ' Tacking Into'Christian ( 2:21 pm CST ) Incredibly , this is the *fifth* post in a row dealing in some part with ' Tacking Into The Wind ' - are there still people left who have n't reviewed it yet ? Even David E. Sluss at the Cynics Corner seems to like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the ' best DS9 episode in years . ' Even so , he still found some problems with the episode : <p> DISCONTINUITY OF THE WEEK RUNNER-UP:Has everyone on DS9 's writing staff forgotten about Odo 's need to regenerate ? What 's this about Odo " resting " by laying on a bunk ? Since shape-shifting and maintaining other forms is accelerating the disease , and since Odo 's humanoid shape is not his natural form , would n't it be best for Odo to remain liquid as much as possible , particularly at the end , when the fact that he has failed to fool Kira is revealed ? Break out the bucket . <p> DSN has been successful , but not as successful as TNG , Ira admits that : " ... on one level it was frustrating , but I think we brought the cult back into Star Trek . There were people who liked The Next Generation who never struck me as Science Fiction fans , to tell you the truth . I think The Next Generation was a very accessible show , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave fans an opportunity to get on board , to have an interesting , unique experience . That 's all we could try to do . Did we want to have more media coverage ? Did we want The X-Files kind of thing ? It would have been nice . But , ultimately by not sitting directly in the spotlight and , therefore , not under quite as much constant scrutiny , we had a lot of creative freedom to do whatever we wanted . And Deep Space Nine was the better for it . " <p> Now that 's more like it . I said last week that " When It Rains ... " was n't bad , but was somewhat padded in terms of setting for future material . Well , where " When It Rains ... " was setup , " Tacking Into the Wind " is the beginning of the payoff , and as such is an episode where you 're more likely to sit back and enjoy the ride . The episode is n't always as meaty as it might be , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up some comments by Voyager cast members about the two latest Voyager episodes of this season , ' Warhead ' and ' Equinox . ' First up is Garrett Wang speaking about ' Warhead : ' <p> Warhead is about Kim being in command of the bridge during night shift , basically , he leads an Away Team to investigate this automated distress signal , and he finds this machine which turns out to be an intelligent bomb . <p> Then he goes on to talk about ' Equinox , ' the season finale : <p> The story revolves around us coming across another Federation ship , it 's a science vessel - it 's not a ship made for deep space exploration . But they , like us , were ripped into the Delta Quadrant . And these people have had similar experiences to the Voyager crew , but have followed a different path . Basically , the episode asks what would happen if a starship got lost in the Delta Quadrant , not unlike the Voyager , but did n't have a captain who tries to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commander has decided to break the regulations , so they have a renegade captain . He 's played by John Savage , who viewers may know from The Deer Hunter , and he 's a really interesting actor . <p> So the first time we see them , they 're under attack from an alien species . We help them out , and it 's only afterwards that we find out that the captain has broken away from Starfleet . <p> Lastly , co-star Robert Duncan McNeill had some comments about ' Equinox : ' <p> I think people are going to be really excited about the finale , it 's real ensemble show . It kind of involves every body . It 's one of those episodes where every one has their own way of participating .... I know there 's been a lot of talk about Voyager getting back to the Alpha Quadrant this year , this episode definitely toys with that idea . <p> Physician , Heal ThyselfChristian ( 2:17 pm CST ) Reuters is reporting that Andy Dick , who starred as the EMH Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' has been arrest on drunk driving and drug possession charges after his car crashed into a utility pole in an upscale section of Los Angeles . <p> Dick , 33 , allegedly fled the scene of the accident Saturday but was later arrested and booked on charges of driving under the influence and possessing a controlled substance . He allegedly was in possession of cocaine and marijuana , a policewoman said . <p> Dick was released after posting $10,000 bail . A court appearance on the charges was set for May 25 . He was driving through Hancock Park , an affluent section of Los Angeles when the accident occurred . The actor , known for his physical comedy and sarcastic wit , plays a bumbling reporter on " NewsRadio , " a situation comedy set in an all-news radio station in New York City . <p> I could insert some comments about the infamous Dutch drug policy here but I think I 'll refrain . Find the full article here , thanks go out to David Henderson at Psi Phi for pointing me to this . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worf to DS9 a shamelessly commercial move . That seems a rather excessive complaint , to me : given the importance and popularity of Klingons in the Star Trek universe , adding the Starfleet officer is both logical and good business -- Vulcans and Ferengi alike would approve . ( Adding a busty blonde in a skin-tight bodysuit that leaves nothing to the imagination -- now *that* would have been shameless . And I say that as one who appreciates 7 of 9 the character and Jeri Ryan the actress . ) <p> For me , the best part about bringing Worf onto the show is that it 's allowed Martok to be brought to the show . I find the one-eyed Klingon general to be the most likable Klingon on any Trek show . and he 's one of my favorite characters on DS9 . ( Funny how so many of my best-liked characters are n't regulars but recurring ones like Dukat , Nog and Martok . ) Not only is he supportive , unpretentious and good-humored , he 's been able to bring Worf back into the Klingon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Way of the Warrior " introduced Worf and made him a Klingon outcast -- again -- it seemed a rerun of storylines we 'd already seen on The Next Generation . Having him be a fussy , perfectionist bride groom struck me as a much moreinteresting use of Worf . <p> Deep Space Nine 's Captain Sisko , Avery Brooks , was in Gary , IN , on Thursday to receive an honorary Doctor of Theater Arts degree from Indiana University-Northwest . His mother taught music and education there , and Brooks himself attended the college from 1966 to 1968 . <p> Continuum ' Tacking Into ...

" Am I pleased with season seven ? I 'm going to honest with you , not that I have n't always been honest with you , but I may have been more political , . Now that we 're coming to the end , I 'll be completely frank . I believe that an incredible chance has not been taken advantage of , and that was the opportunity to have a whole year to end a series after a very successful run . It 's hard for me to imagine what the writers and producers would have written about if Terry Farrell had remained with the show as Jadzia Dax . " <p> " For me , when you 're in your seventh season and you 're tired of the make-up , you 've really investigated your character inside out and upside down and you love the fact that you 're making the most money you ever made in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a week , it 's fine . You 're still getting paid . You still have people loving your character . The work that you do get to do is interesting and challenging . I 've been allowed to go off and do a lot of other things . ... There is no resentment on my part that it has n't been about Odo . This show has been plenty about Odo and I do n't in any way feel that I 've been overlooked . " <p> " What 's happened now is we suddenly have seven shows left to do and the producers have had to say ' Oh my God , we have to end this thing ' , and they 're jamming the stories together . The scripts are much too long . I 'm actually talking as a director now . I just did an episode Strange Bedfellows which was a full act too long . We shot a full day 's more work than could ever be in the show because they 're trying to jam the stories in , to wind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' returns with another of his spoiler-packed looks at this week 's upcoming episode of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine titled " Extreme Measures .

But we have n't been promising that it will be coming out and then not shipping it after an extended period of time , missing previously promised release dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will it ever see the light of day ? Honestly , I do n't think so . The odds are against it , and getting worse every month .

Yadda-yadda-yadda . <p> That , however , is not the offical Interplay position . Officially , it 's on hiatus . Not cancelled , not in the release queue .

Christian ( 1:10 pm CST ) Matthew Smith just sent me a rather interesting bit of news about the upcoming turn-based strategy game from Microprose . According to the June issue of PC Gamer UK , ' Birth of the Federation ' has entered the official sales top 20 at No. 9 ! Considering the game wo n't be arriving in stores for more than a week , I must say this is rather surprising - the only explanation I can think of is that thousands of people have already pre-ordered the game , which would certainly be good news . Matthew also mentioned that this new PC Gamer issue contains the ' PC Gamer Top 100 Awards of All Time , ' which includes Microprose 's ' Klingon Honour Guard ' at No. 89 : <p> The inevitable Startrek license made it in time for last Christmas , but felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotted , its graphics are messy at times and the levels never quite live up to those of Unreal .

He met with the development teams of ' Armada , ' ' Voyager : Elite Force ' and ' Insurrection , ' and he was extremely enthusiastic about these three games . He 'll be writing up detailed reports over the coming week , but you might perhaps be interested in the following preliminary release dates : <p> ' Insurrection ' - 11/99 . <p> ' Armada ' 12/99 or 1/2000 , though the game is ahead of schedule ( the voice-overs from Patrick Stewart have already been taped ! ) <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' 3/2000 . <p> Even though the meetings with the development teams were absolutely fascinating , the highlight of the day was clearly his meeting with Nicole deBoer , who was promoting the DS9 - The Fallen game at E3 .

If you really want to be on the safe side , I 'd advise you to click here to move on to the next update . <p> Daring deBoer ( which used to be ' Obsessive Attitudes : Nicole deBoer ' ) has re-printed an article which first appeared in the June issue fo Starlog magazine , entitled ' The Last Days of Dax . ' The article contains a rather amusing part dealing with the Ezri/Bashir relationship : <p> deBoer speaks highly of both Dorn and Siddig , but her conversation about them quickly shifts in another direction . " Michael and Sid are different guys . Very different , " deBoer says , chuckling . " I 've really just started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forgot the many , many scenes I had with Sid over the season . I guess I was thinking they were going to go with Ezri and Worf . I was n't thinking at all about a relationship with Julian . So , I had all these scenes with Julian and I just assumed it was a friendship . That 's the way I always played it . " <p> " When I was doing the scenes with Worf , where we were in prison together , I asked the writers , ' So , what 's going to happen ? ' Whenever they tell me anything , they have a little smile on their faces . They said , ' Well , you guys are going to get together , but not for very long . You 'll find that you 're just friends . Your true love has n't come along yet . He 's coming up . ' I was like , ' Who ? ! Who is it ? ! ' But they would n't tell me . Once I realized they were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , have we ever shown any chemistry in the past ? ' Then I looked back on the episodes and remembered how many scenes Ezri actually had with Julian . " <p> The full article has deBoer talking about the upcoming end of DS9 , but also includes several pictures taken from Starlog - go check it out ! <p> I was at a Convention in Melbourne Australia today and the guest was Garrett Wang . He said from the Season 6 stories he has seen so far , Voyager does n't get back to the Alpha Quadrant yet . His opinion is that Paramount will use the Delta Quadrant all it can before they go back . Also he confirmed the rumor that Kate Mulgrew wanted to leave the series because of her family . but every time he asked her she kept changing her mind one minute she was leaving the next she was n't . But he said the last time he asked she was staying . <p> More Year 6 rumours will undoubtedly be posted here as they become available . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any airport , in any city , on any day , and you ca n't help but spot them , skipping playfully along the moving sidewalks , whistling as they check their bags , always making sure they arrive at least two hours before their scheduled departure .

Inside the flight cabin , you 'll invariably find them sitting in their assigned seats , buckled securely , smiling , sipping slowly at their little plastic cups full of 7-Up . They are courteous , well-behaved , and cheerful at all times . They keep their tray tables in the upright and locked position , and they 'd never dream of causing a moment 's trouble for their flight attendants . They 're the lively , life-of-the-party people who 'll brighten your flight by yelling " He-e-e-e-e-ere we go-o-o-o " as you take off , and later , launch into an appreciative round of applause as you land . <p> These people make me sick , and I 'd like to personally smack every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hatred of flying , plus a convention report , can be found in the full excerpt . <p> Leonard Nimoy Chat TranscriptChristian ( 1:41 pm CST ) In case you missed last Thursday 's live chat with Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) at the Continuum , they 've just put up the full chat transcript . Take a look at a few of the more interesting quotes : <p> Derek asks : I heard you were given a chance to be in Star Trek : Generations , but that you refused . Why ? <p> Leonard Nimoy : I was actually asked to direct the picture as well as appear in it . Sadly , I had a difference of opinion regarding the story , and there really was n't a specific Spock role for me to play , so I had to forego both . <p> Nameless ( my chat disguise ) asks : Have you ever considered visiting one of the Star Trek chat rooms ? I think it would be interesting to have some of the TOS cast around for the trivia sessions in the Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chats some years ago and found it frustrating because nobody believed I was really there . <p> Danwheels asks : Hello Mr. Nimoy , great to talk to you ! My Question is : I am a phyically challenged confined to a wheelchair . Do you think total equality for people will ever happen as it has done in the Trek universe ? <p> Leonard Nimoy : The most compelling ST episode dealing with this issue was the one in which Spock hijacks the Enterprise to take the injured Capt . Pike to the forbidden Thalos IV planet where he can live a full mental existance . The Menagerie . I had this conversation with Stephen Hawking . The issue and question is , when will science catch up with science fiction ? Perhaps one day all of the wonderful concepts which have been developed by imaginative writers will be fulfilled by equally talented scientists . After all , the idea of space travel and moon landings came from the writers first and the science followed . <p> The Continuum : Andrew RobinsonChristian ( 1:41 pm CST ) Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with Andrew Robinson ( Garak ) . Actually , it was apparently put up on the 30th of April , but since I have n't read about it anywhere yet I thought I 'd post about it here as well : - ) . The interview even contains some info on his new book - ' Garak 's Memoirs : ' <p> Robinson is writing Garak 's memoirs . " One of the things that got me writing was talking with fans who love to talk to me about my character . I got tired of repeating things , like explaining makeup , and wanted to do something different . I started writing Garak 's memoirs as if they written by him , finding areas of life that interested me . When I started reading them at conventions , it was enormously popular . Writer David George DS9 novel #23 , The 34th Rule , written with Armin Shimerman and Eric Stillwell urged me to contact Pocket Books and now I 'm writing this book about Garak .

On one hand , I have to try and think of a totally alien culture in order to write about Garak 's family and friends , but I still have to use my own emotional experiences or else what the hell am I going to write about ? " <p> Avery Brooks Narrates New DVDChristian ( 1:40 pm CST ) A company press release from SlingShot Entertainment mentions that they 'll soon be bringing out the IMAX-film ' The Greatest Places ' on DVD . The film was produced by the Science Museum of Minnesota and takes you on a journey to seven of the most geographically dynamic locations on Earth , including the Amazon , Greenland , Iguazu Falls , Namib Desert , Okavango , Tibet and Madagascar . Interestingly , Avery Brooks ( Benjamin Sisko ) narrated the DVD , which should make it interesting for Trek fans as well .

Check out three of the current discussions : <p> -In our Web Design forum , we discuss the use of CGI in Star Trek sites . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:39 pm CST ) This afternoon , I was checking my mail when suddenly I noticed it had become strangely silent . I started to wonder precisely what it was that had stopped making noise , when I realized it was my pc 's fan ! Of course , I nearly had a heart attack as I envisioned my computer melting down , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with my old television as well , after all . <p> Well , it did . The fan started humming again , and I sank back in my chair ... for about five seconds , when the thing stopped again . I hit it another time , and again the fan started working for another five seconds . Of course , I still had to start on updating TrekToday , and all my files were on this pc ! So , I quickly got a disk , and started copying all the relevant files to that disk , all the time slamming my computer every five seconds . After about 20 slams , the thing stopped working altogether , but fortunately I had already copied all the files to disk . <p> I 'm updating the site from another computer now , so all is well again .

Over the coming week , he 'll be writing up detailed previews of most of the games on the show , but he has already uploaded the report of his first day : <p> Well , Day One of E3 has passed and I was able to survive the madness that is E3 . Every other year , this ( dare I use the word ) " titanic " gaming convention , arguably the largest of its kind , is held in Los Angeles at the LA Convention Center . <p> He then goes on to talk about his experiences during the day , and even includes a mini-preview of the upcoming ' Deep Space Nine : The Fallen ' game : <p> From what I saw of the game , I was rather impressed by the graphics and the sound . They certainly did capture the flavor of the show 's gritty nature rather accurately , from the various corridors on the station , to an ore processing plant , to a Bajoran pagh wraith temple . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play as Sisko , Kira , or Worf , you will still be able to interact with many of the other characters on the series . And that does n't just mean the main cast , which includes Odo , Jadzia Dax ( not Ezri , since this game takes place in the sixth season ) , O'Brien , Quark , and Bashir , but also many of the supporting cast , such as Garak , Admiral Ross , Kai Winn , Weyoun , and Dukat . <p> The full report contains lots more on this , including the news that there will be a special bonus level featuring Garak and Dukat ! Find the full report here , and remember to check back often at our main E3 site for the latest reports . We 've also included a handy sub-menu right here at TrekToday , so you 'll always be able to see when we 've added new stuff ! <p> Activision Game PreviewsChristian ( 2:02 pm CST ) As part of our exclusive E3 Coverage , we 've put up a pre-show preview of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we look at the real-time strategy game ' Armada , ' the first-person shooter ' Voyager : Elite Force ' and the adventure game ' Insurrection . ' Take a look at how our Armada preview begins : <p> ' Star Trek : Armada ' is the first real-time strategy game set in the ' Star Trek : The Next Generation ' universe . After the failed ' First Contact ' game from Microprose , it 's also the first game to heavily feature the Borg . In the game , a starship from the future has materialized to warn of the latest Borg threat . You are in charge of the fleets of the Federation , Klingon , Romulan and Borg ships that will wage this epic battle . Build starships , construct space stations , and research special weapons to lead your side to victory . Along the journey you will survive a Klingon civil war , Romulan subterfuge and the Borg 's search for perfection . <p> The full preview also contains info on the two other Activision games , and it provides you with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! <p> Yes , it 's true . I 've signed on for a two-year tour of duty aboard the starship Voyager and as you read this , I 'm sitting down to write my first script for Janeway and the gang . I 'll be happy to talk about Voyager and to answer your questions , before I get into all that , let me say a few words about the end of one of my favorite television shows , Deep Space Nine . <p> ... <p> I loved Deep Space Nine . I loved the people I worked with and I loved the world that we all created . It was a special show and a unique experience for me as a writer and as a person . I look back on it with a sense of pride at what we accomplished and with regret that all good things must come to an end . <p> I hope that you , the viewers , have enjoyed watching the episodes half as much as we enjoyed bringing them to you . Thank you for your long support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no DS9 . <p> Hi folks , I 've been very busy the last couple of weeks , assignments etc due in , exams 3 weeks off , moving house , buying a car ... the list goes on ! Ok , this issue we have more in depth info on the DS9 finale arc and the closing of voyager , as well as a new affiliate site Star Trek Australia . It 's all in there , so , I suggest we get reading ! <p> If you did n't yet receive the new issue in your mailbox , you can read it online by going here . Information on how to subscribe can be found here . <p> For those still counting , this is the ninth Star Trek movie . It 's also the ninth time Hollywood has failed to even come close to producing a film that 's as satisfying as some of the episodes of the TV series.Maybe the movies ' creators feel they have to justify the bigger budget , or try to attract non-Star Trek fans with a simplistic story . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big-screen Trek formula : bigger explosions , better special effects and flimsier scripts . <p> The full review awards the episode with just 2 stars . Thanks go out to Michael Hodges for the link . <p> Autobiographical Whitney Movie ? Christian ( 1:25 pm CST ) A news report at Express News talks about a Star Trek convention which will take place in San Antonio this weekend , and which will be attended by RenT Auberjonois ( Odo ) , Robert Picardo ( The Doctor ) and Grace Lee Whitney ( Yeoman Janice Rand ) . Included in the report is the news that a movie version of her autobiography may soon be appearing : <p> Paramount has , according to Whitney , given her their permission to have her autobiography made into a " movie of the week " . " I 'm trying to get Leonard Nimoy to direct it , " she said . " I would love Heather Locklear to play me . " <p> You can find the full news report here , while Whitney 's autobiography can apparently be bought online at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feature film about " Star Trek " fans , will be released in North America on May 21 on approximately 330 screens . Paramount will expand the release to other markets if the fans support the film . HELP SPREAD THE WORD ! ! <p> QUOTABLE OF THE WEEK : The Doctor , upon learning that temporal anomalies were making the crew ( and viewers ) sick : " I was beginning to suspect some kind of anomaly . " Ha ! On that ship , anomalies should always be the prime suspect . On a related note , I had to smile when Doc noticed that the clocks in the mess hall and sickbay showed different times . Normal people would assume that the clocks were simply set differently ; Voyager people , naturally , assume a temporal anomaly is to blame . <p> Target 5 " Exclusives Wave IIChristian ( 1:24 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac is reporting that the ' Data in Movie Uniform ' and ' Seven of Nine ' Target Exclusives have begun arriving in stores . As you may recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Datas , so Seven of Nine fans should be able to find enough figures . More news can be found by visiting the Raving Toy Maniac 's news page - it also includes news of a special contest sponsored by Viacom which I unfortunately forgot to report on a few days ago . <p> Starburst Previews DS9 FinaleChristian ( 1:22 pm CST ) The latest issue of Starburst Magazine ( issue 250 ! ) contains a rather huge feature on the DS9 finale , ' What You Leave Behind . ' The people at Starburst have been so kind as to include a small preview of their feature , which has DS9 executive producer Ira Steven Behr talking about the finale : <p> " I think that the idea is to finish the story that we started in the pilot ( Emissary ) . That 's the overall thought behind the final two-hour episode , " explains Behr , who has been with DSN since its inception , first as a writer , then as a writer-producer , and finally as its executive producer and day-to-day guiding force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who came to an assignment , on a space station , that he was not too happy with , who then got slowly sucked into not only the life of the station , but the life of Bajor . He became the Emissary of the Prophets and basically discovered that this assignment he did not want was the most important assignment in the Alpha Quadrant . <p> " What You Leave Behind finishes up that story . What I wanted to do , what I thought would be nice , was to have a final episode that , if the only two episodes of DSN you watched were the pilot and the final two-hour episode even though there would be things that obviously would not make sense in the specific it would make sense overall . Overall , you would get it . You 'd get that there was a beginning and now there is an end . So , What You Leave Behind is the end . " . <p> Find a bit more in the full preview , though the full feature can only be read by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven for pointing me to this . <p> Playing on the time-tested ( if by now a bit shopworn ) formula that has proved so successful since Gene Roddenberry first created the TV series , " Star Trek : Insurrection " follows the crew of the Starship Enterprise to a remote planet inhabited by a race of well-groomed humanoids living in a climate not unlike Northern California . There , Captain Kirk -- I mean Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) -- gets to cuddle with a leggy alien in pink lip gloss while wrestling with his conscience and the eternal question of whether to violate the " prime directive " of non-interference . It 's a safe but satisfying sci-fi security blanket that die-hard trekkies will undoubtedly love . Contains oblique references to hanky- panky and breasts . <p> " 11:59 " performed extremely poorly for Voyager last week , dropping to a fairly pathetic 3.2 rating , ranking 92nd . That 's even down from " Someone to Watch Over Me " ' s disappointing 3.4 mark last week . This showing was also down quite a bit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Voyager was firmly stuck in 6th place for its timeslot , lagging far behind the #5 show , " Charmed , " which earned a 3.9 . With the WWF special out of the lineup , Voyager easily reclaimed the #1 UPN spot . <p> Wednesday 's ' Relativity ' seems to have done a lot better , at least according to the overnight ratings : <p> " Relativity " scored a quite good overnight rating for this second sweek of sweeps , bringing in a 6.1 rating , 9 share . That 's one of the higher overnight ratings of the season and is up half a point and one share from last week 's " 11:59 " ( 5.6/8 ) . Voyager also climbed out of its usual 6th place hole for the week , beating the WB 's " Charmed , " which turned out a 5.6/8 in a first-run episode . The next up was Fox 's " Party of Five " which snagged a 7.9/12 in fourth . <p> I 've been way off the last two weeks in predicting the final standing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but " Relativity " should definately turn out a very good national number . As for what " Relativity " had going for it that the other two shows did n't , I 'm not entirely sure . It 's most likely due to the fact that this was the first show of the most recent three to have a strong action element . The show actually has a very good shot at breaking " One " ' s mark from a year ago at a 3.9 . <p> Lastly , the site has the ratings report for the third DS9 Final Chapter episode , which did n't do as well as it could have done : <p> " Strange Bedfellows " rose a bit entering sweeps earning a 4.2 rating , ranking 14th . That 's up 3% from last week and , quite unbelievably , flat from last year 's " The Reckoning . " This is the first time all year that a season 7 episode has equaled a season 6 episode . In competition , Xena and Hercules are dying fast . DS9 was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 3.5 and Xena was in third with a 3.3 . Xena is now nearing lowest ever ratings and poses no threat to DS9 . It 's all but certain that DS9 will end its run where it started -- as the number one first-run syndicated weekly . <p> Besides this , there are even a few other positive sides to these ratings , as you can read in the full Strange Bedfellows report . Some more info can also be found in the full 11:59 report and the full Relativity report . <p> ' Hercules ' Leaves For Roddenberry SeriesChristian ( 1:21 pm CST ) After rumours had been going on for the past few months , Hercules star Kevin Sorbo has officially announced he will be leaving ' Hercules : The Legendary Journeys . ' However , in a rather more surprising move his next project will be a new series developed by the late Gene Roddenberry , and produced by Majel Barrett Roddenberry and the Tribune Entertainment Company : <p> Tribune Entertainment Company , Majel Barrett Roddenberry and international television star Kevin Sorbo ( Hercules : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop the science- fiction/action hour television programs Gene Roddenberry 's Andromeda ' ' and Gene Roddenberry 's Starship ' ' ( both working titles ) based upon works from the late Star Trek ' ' creator 's archives . The projects , one of which will ultimately star Mr. Sorbo , are being developed for Fall 2000 and further expand Tribune Entertainment 's ongoing initiative to increase its growing portfolio of programming and its leading role in building upon the world renowned Gene Roddenberry brand . Mr. Sorbo , Dick Askin , president and chief executive officer of Tribune Entertainment , and Ms. Roddenberry jointly made the announcement today . <p> Both ' Andromeda ' and ' Starship ' will be based on scripts found in the Gene Roddenberry archives , and both will be science-fiction series : <p> Gene Roddenberry 's Andromeda , ' ' set millenniums ago , follows the time travels of Alexander Grange , a doctoral student living on the planet Korkyra . As he studies his five scientific disciplines , an apocalyptic war devastates Korkyra and propels Alexander 500 years into the future to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he studied with on his home planet . Thrust into a world with no friends or family , Alexander 's mission in life suddenly becomes to uncover the whereabouts of his loved ones , and bring peace and civilization back to his world . <p> A futuristic action hour in which a peaceful Earth is run by an organization of artists , scientists and teachers working to bring harmony throughout the universe , Gene Roddenberry 's Starship ' ' chronicles the exploration space vessel Starship that serves as home to a team of Galactic trouble-shooters led by Captain Dylan Hunt . After leaving Earth to study the far reaches of the universe , where a long and brutal territorial war between aliens takes place , Hunt and his crew discover worlds that are vastly different from the humanistic and civilized society they left behind . <p> It is n't certain yet in which of the two series Sorbo will star , but , whichever one it is , he will also be co-producing the series . More on the actual series can be found in this press release , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legendary Journeys ' can be found here . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 1:20 pm CST ) -Tomorrow at 16:00 BST , British television station Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Sanctuary , ' followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Resistance . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:19 pm CST ) We had a great response to the opening of our E3 site yesterday - thanks to all of you who wrote in to compliment on the site ! Today the first reports directly from E3 itself were actually put up - do n't forget to read Jeff 's report of the first E3 day , as it contains some all-new info on the upcoming Deep Space Nine adventure game . We 'll be adding more exclusive reports to the E3 site over the coming week - do n't forget to check back often . <p> David Henderson at Psi Phi has put up the full press release for Voyager 's Warhead , which includes a synopsis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress signal from an alien missile , Ensign Kim , Torres and The Doctor determine that it 's a complex , damaged weapon with artificial intelligence and sentient consciousness . But when they beam this mysterious device aboard , it interlinks with The Doctor 's program and through him , insists the U.S.S. Voyager enable it to fulfill its mission of mass destruction . <p> All in all , nicely done . The arc finally has the finish line in sight--the death of Gowron and ascension of Martok makes for some dramatic storytelling , and gives the final chapter a sense of the beginning of the end . Granted , this angle is a " bit " forced , appearing out of nowhere last week , and suddenly wrapping up this week , and is a bit predictable ( camera shot through giant glass map of ship movement just screams " break me ! " ) But I found myself enjoying it , despite my general dislike of Klingon episodes . <p> But I can easily put my finger on WHY I liked it . Ezri 's speech . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells out her view how the Klingon empire is weak and dieing : can Worf name a Chancellor that he is able to call honorable ? Can the Klingons really be fighting a war where the alpha quadrant itself is at sake , and Gowron is more concerned about the potential poltical rival in Martok ? It 's over the top , yes , but so out-of-the blue , so direct , and so bloody accurate that it really helped capture this particular klingon story . And when we think back , what have been the compelling klingon stories : the klingon civil war ( the house of duras conspiring with romulans ) , worf losing and regaining his honor , a changeling Gowron ( why replace the original when its bad enough ! ) , more of the Sisters of Duras ST : Generations ) . It may be a bit pedantic in the execution--but it makes for a compelling and exciting drama in the midst of the war at large . I for one , am happy to see Martok ( a great character from the beginning ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:03 pm CST ) Paul Weaver , former webmaster of FedCom , just sent me the news that the Ultimate PC magazine printed a review of Microprose 's ' Birth of the Federation , which they awarded no less than 91% : <p> This is a superb title from Microprose , and as one of the final titles from them before Activision 's exclusive licensing deal comes into effect , ' Birth of the Federation ' surely rates as one of the best Star Trek games ever . <p> The game was selected as an ' Editor 's Choice , ' which certainly is good news for the game . The magazine also contains a preview of Interplay 's ' Starfleet Command , ' in case you 're interested . Thanks go out to Paul Weaver for reporting this . <p> The final shot of Kira holding a ravaged Odo was heartbreaking ; I 'm anticipating needing hankies the next few weeks , even though I 'd bet money that Odo will be cured by Bashir and will in turn cure his people despite their misdeeds . Next week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the word " genocide " in the preview , and I want to know how these nice Starfleet officers are going to react when they learn that a group of their own has committed an atrocity greater than anything the Cardassians did to the Bajorans , greater than anything the Dominion did to any of its members . It 's hideous - we 've seen that in the tatters of Odo 's body - and it 's appalling on a level so deep that nothing Winn and Dukat might do , nothing the Breen might do , nothing the Jem'Hadar might do can possibly compete . I hope it 's handled superbly . <p> Jeri Ryan Talk Show PicsChristian ( 2:03 pm CST ) The Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage has put up 14 screencaps of yesterday ' appearance by Jeri Ryan ( Voyager , Seven of Nine ) on the Howie Mandel Show , the soon-to-be cancelled Paramount talk show . As usual , they mostly show Jeri Ryan smiling at the camera , but there are also some shots from Voyager included . You can find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SigningsChristian ( 2:01 pm CST ) The Continuum has put up a list of upcoming book signings by William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) , which will all take place in May . The book signings have been organized to promote his new fan book ' Get A Life ! , ' which he wrote together with Chris Kreski . Find the locations and dates of the three book signings here . <p> Leonard Nimoy Chat TodayChristian ( 2:01 pm CST ) Today , the Continuum will be hosting a live chat with Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) . The chat begins at 06:30pm Pacific Time , though advance questions can already be submitted here . If you want to know how you can participate you can find info on that here . <p> I enjoyed this story , just as I enjoyed it the first time I encountered it , in Vonda McIntyre 's The Entropy Effect - the very first Star Trek novel from Pocket Books and one of the finest . In that book Spock chased a madman from the future whose double in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing similar chaos among past and present crews . Having read that novel , it was entirely too easy to predict all the twists and turns of this inferior copy , like Braxton himself becoming the psychotic saboteur . Still , it was fun to see Janeway wear the bun of steel again ... and if it was less-than-fun to see Seven hailed again as the only person capable of setting the universe right , I guess that 's the way it goes on this series . <p> Other than the blatant theft of a previously better-told story - hardly a new problem on Voyager , which gets most of its watchable episodes by recycling the previous Treks - my main criticisms of " Relativity " have to do with that pesky continuity issue . On the one hand , it was really nice to see Joe Carey for the first time in four years . On the other hand , the only thing we ever learned about Joe Carey ( other than that Torres broke his nose in " Parallax " ) was that he had a wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly that in " Prime Factors " he helped steal the Sikarian trajector to make an attempt . Here , he spends most of his screen time hitting on Seven of Nine . What 's the point in resurrecting a character from the past if the writers are going to turn him into a different person ? <p> Michael Iversen at the Universe has received one page of the script for ' Warhead , ' next week 's new Voyager episode . It 's page 23 , and deals with the first time B'Elanna Torres and Harry Kim realize the Doctor has been taken over by the artificial intelligence inside the Warhead . You can read precisely what happens then on the actual script page . <p> Furthermore , the Universe has received a little note about the ' Equinox ' reshoots : <p> The new scenes involve ( mostly ) one of the characters from the ship " Equinox " . Her name is Gilmore , and she meets Naomi , and helps Chakotay decrypt some files and such . <p> ' Strange Bedfellows ' RatingsChristian ( 1:57 pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't bringing in much higher ratings , according to a report written by Cynthia Littleton for Variety . The report deals with the syndicated ratings for the week which ended the 2nd of May , which was the week when ' Strange Bedfellows ' aired . Take a look at how DS9 performed : <p> Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ' ' upticked 2% from the previous week to a 4.2 in households , but its demo score fell 6% to a 2.9 . <p> In a bit of ' good ' news , the competition ( Xena and Hercules ) did even worse than DS9 , as you can read in the full report . <p> The overnight ratings is in , and Voyager did a lot better than last week . Voyager got a 6.1/9 , that 's up 0.5 from last week . Voyager was 5th for the hour , beating WB ; s Charmed that got a 5.6/8 . <p> A final rating would be around 3.6 - 4.1 . Note that UPN can only be seen in 70% of USA , so if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Just think about it , Someone To Watch Over Me got a 3.4 - now if that was 97% like DS9 , then its rating would have been 4.7. 7 Days got a 3.8/6 , that 's down 0.2 from last weeks episode . Because of 7 Days " low " rating , then UPN was 6th for the night . ( It 's a normal rating for 7 days ) <p> Takei Speaks At Money MeetingChristian ( 1:57 pm CST ) A press release from State Farm Insurance Companies mentions that George Takei will be a special guest speaker at a reception which will be held tonight dealing with a new money management programs aimed at Asian-Americans .

PST on www.CountdownTV.com to discuss the upcoming Star Wars film and the characteristics of the different Star Wars and Star Trek genres . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:51 pm CST ) Wow , I 'm late ! But fortunately I have a good reason to be , as I spent all day creating our E3 Coverage Site . Over there , we 'll be providing you with reports of what 's happening at the biggest gaming expo of the year , previews of the latest Star Trek games , and interviews with game developers . Already now we have a few mini-previews up , which were written by yours truly and even include a few all-new screenshots . <p> Starting sometime this evening ( US Time ) , the absolutely wonderful Jeff Koga will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is currently walking around at E3 . Major thanks go out to Jeff for agreeing to report about the conference for us - there are few things I have ever appreciated more ! <p> Special thanks should also go out to Leonard Schuurmans , webmaster of Warp Eleven , who created the fabulous logo and most of the lay-out of our E3 site . <p> Update 21:55 CET : Ho hum . It appears people using Netscape will miss the first few lines of the text at the E3 site . The incredible Leonard Schuurmans is currently working on a fix , which should be done in an hour or so . <p> Wednesday May 12 , 1999 <p> Star Trek E3 PreviewChristian ( 3:15 pm CST ) E3.net has posted a small preview of Activision 's upcoming Star Trek games , which will be shown at this week 's Electronic Entertainment Expo . Take a look at how the preview begins : <p> With all the Star Wars hype permeating the media like a rabid computer virus , it 's easy to forget that long before Luke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another group of space cadets who made the future safe for high action and low melodrama . The crews of the Enterprise and its successors have been teaching alien cultures about freedom , liberty and yes , the fine art of kissing , for three decades . With four prime-time TV series and nine feature films to its credit , the Star Trek franchise is perhaps the only one with the legs to take on Lucas and his two-ton marketing juggernaut . <p> As with any TV/film franchise , games based on the Star Trek universe have always been a dicey proposition . For every Star Wars-based flop like Masters of Teras Kasi or Rebellion , there 's been a corresponding Klingon Honor Guard or the promising vaporware of The Secret of Vulcan Fury . Now , new Star Trek licensee Activision has three new titles on the way , spanning the Star Trek universe , from The Next Generation to Voyager . <p> The full preview also contains a few new screenshots , but the text looks suspiciously like the Adrenaline Vault preview . Expect lots more E3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TrekToday will be very closely following the event . Thanks go out to Star Trek Gaming Central for pointing me to this . <p> DS9 Cast PhotosChristian ( 2:44 pm CST ) In a rather great move , the Continuum has put up the DS9 cast photos for the last seven seasons . They 're especially nice if you put them next to each other and see how the cast has evolved over the past seven years - it 's the most obvious with Cirroc Lofton , of couse , but most of the other cast members have also changed quite a bit . You can find all the cast photos by going here , but remember that ( just like the one I printed here ) , they 're all copyrighted by Paramount . <p> Jerry Goldsmith To Receive AwardChristian ( 2:24 pm CST ) Variety is reporting that Jerry Goldsmith , who scored 4 Star Trek movies and created the themes for TNG and Voyager , will soon be honoured with an ' Outstanding Achievement ' award : <p> Jerry Goldsmith , composer of more than 175 movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Oscar-winning The Omen , ' ' will be honored Aug. 9 during the Hollywood Film Festival 's awards ceremony at the Beverly Hilton . Goldsmith is to receive the Outstanding Achievement in Music prize from the fest , which will run Aug. 4-9 in its third outing . <p> I picked up my copy of the Star Trek : Insurrection DVD today--I have n't seen the whole thing yet , but so far ) , it looks and sounds great . The box is a keep-case , and features a new description of the film , along with headshots of the crew and a picture of the Ba'ku planet . If you have n't seen the film yet , there are spoilers ahead . There are no cut scenes on the disc--looks like we 're going to have to wait for the rumored Trek special edition DVDs for the really good stuff . And those discs , should they come to be , are ( at least ) a couple of years off . <p> The Museum will premiere the two-hour finale of this science fiction series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since its debut in 1993 , this offspring of Star Trek : The Next Generation--set in a space station in the twenty-fourth century--has combined thought-provoking themes with a galaxy of multifaceted crew members and interplanetary beings . Tickets are $5 ( free for Museum members ) and may be purchased in the Museum lobby , or by calling the Museum at 310/786-1091 , Wednesday through Sunday between 12:00 - 5:00 p.m . The screening on May 27th is sold out . <p> You can find the original article here . Thanks go out to Michael Iversen at the Universe for sending this to me . <p> Here 's a question for you : Does the title of " Star Trek : Insurrection " refer to the plot , or the way longtime fans will react after sitting through this mediocre sequel ? A little of both , I 'm afraid , for if ever a big-screen franchise could have done without another regurgitation of a tried and true formula , this is it . Tried and true ? Try shopworn and shallow . <p> ... <p> The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , the digital effects crew does a commendable job . Things snap , crackle and energize here at a frantic pace . The fact is , Star Trek has never been just about special effects ; it 's a series built on high-falutin ' moral imperatives , especially the prime directive to respect all life forms . That directive gets trotted out , then tossed away once the shooting starts . The result is a space opera whose thesis appears to be " my phaser is bigger than your phaser . " Factor in erratic pacing and an uninspired plot , and " Star Trek : Insurrection " proves less than the sum of its parts . What happened to the days when the series was content to boldly go where no man had gone before ? <p> The final rating for 11:59 is in , and it does n't look good . Voyager got a 3.2 and was nr. 92 . That is down 0.2 from " Someone To Watch Over Me " . Voyager was 6th for the hour , behind Charmed that got a 3.9 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UPN Thursday Night Movie : Primal Force with a 2.4 , Moesha with a 2.2 and Dilbert with a 2.0 . <p> Update 21:27 CET : You might also want to check out this report at Yahoo , which mentions that ' 11:59 ' was still the top-rated UPN show at No.92 . <p> ' Warhead ' TrailerChristian ( 1:27 pm CST ) Star Trek Interactive ! has put up the trailers for ' Warhead , ' next week 's new Voyager episode . As is becoming more and more usual these days , Vidiot is down yet again , so Star Trek Interactive is currently the only place for you to find the trailers . As usual , they 're available as MPEG and as ASF video clips , but also as MP3 audio files or still images . You can find the trailers by going here . <p> Adventures In Time And SpaceChristian ( 1:25 pm CST ) At the Star Trek Book Board , Pocket Books ' senior editor John Ordover just made a post about the upcoming ' Adventures In Time And Space ' book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book featuring the best moments from Pocket 's 20 years of publishing Star Trek novels , and this is how it 's going to be structured : <p> No framing story - we could have come with one , but it would have seemed very , very hokey . Instead , what Mary did was pick out the best moments ( In her humble opinion , and I 'm -sure- there will be loud wails and arguments , as there would have been no matter what she 'd picked ) from our 20 years of Trek publishing . The excerpts are arranged into sections and categories and such , and Mary 's written an introduction and intros to each of the excerpts . <p> The book also includes the long-awaited Star Trek Novel Chronology that places the books into Trek continuity as well as can be , and I expect arguments there , too. : ) <p> I have to wonder if that book will really be interesting to read - on television , clip shows are n't usually the best ones imaginable .

People were noting " RIP " on his show signs weeks ago where the show was shot . Yes , the humor can be cruel in the industry . <p> Ah bit of trivia : Paramount geared up to have the Mandel production done on their lot - for some unknown reason it ended up at the NBC Burbank Plant on Alameda .

Hite is one of the people who created the ' Star Trek : The Next Generation ' role-playing game , and in this new edition of the column he mentions he is currently working on ' All Our Yesterdays , ' a new source book for the Star Trek RPG which will deal exclusively with time travel . <p> The Insider has managed to get his mitts on some shots from the upcoming final episode of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine titled " What You Leave Behind . " As one might expect , Paramount is trying to be as careful as possible to not show anything particular shocking or revelatory in these shots . <p> Three more screenshots ( plus larger-sized versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On ' Ally McBeal'Christian ( 1:21 pm CST ) CARPE , the Central Alliance of Robert Picardo Enthusiasts , is reporting that the actor best known for his role as the Doctor on Voyager will soon be guest starring on ' Ally McBeal : ' <p> This coming Monday ( May 17 ) Robert Picardo will be guest-starring on Fox 's hit comedy " Ally McBeal " as a man who sues his wife for fraud when he discovers that she does n't really love him .

' Take a look at how the official press release described the episode , courtesy of Psi Phi : <p> In an episode that revisits Janeway 's first day aboard the U.S.S. Voyager and then fast forwards 500 years beyond it when her ship is destroyed , Captain Braxton of the 29th century Federation Timeship Relativity contacts Seven of Nine to go back in time to solve the mystery of who planted the " temporal disrupter " which ultimately destroyed the U.S.S. Voyager . But when the new starship captain , Janeway , catches the mysterious Seven aboard the brand new U.S.S. Voyager , she detains her , an interference that could contaminate the time-line . <p> -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Necessary Evil ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST . Tomorrow at 18:00 BST , BBC Two will be showing DS9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , Sat.1 will be repeating TNG 's ' Das Interface ' ( Interface ) tomorrow morning at 7:10 CET in the morning . That 's also the only Star Trek episode which will be shown in Germany tomorrow , this because of Ascension Day . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:18 pm CST ) The internet is really acting up for me today . For some strange reason I 'm unable to connect to several big sites - including Yahoo and the Continuum . Unfortunately , that also means I wo n't be able to report on the news I usually get from those sources - I 'll try to make up for that as soon as I 'm able to reach those sites again . <p> Update 21:24 CET : Yeehaa ! It 's working again ! <p> Tuesday May 11 , 1999 <p> No Canada CutsChristian ( 2:01 pm CST ) Thanks to Karen Bennett and Karen Trenholm ( Karen must be a very common name in Canada ; - ) , I found out something rather interesting about the Voyager cuts issue . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett : I 'm in Toronto , and we get Voyager on two non-UPN stations , and I have n't noticed any cuts . But if I watch UPN , the trailer and the credits are cut . <p> Karen Trenholm : We in Canada are getting the full versions of the Voyager eps . <p> What this also means is that new Voyager episodes are still being produced with two minutes of extra footage , which are then cut out by UPN ! Surely this is n't really cost-effective for Paramount ? In any case , this also means that when new Voyager episodes make their way to other countries or to video , everyone will actually still be able to see the scenes that were cut for American release , so I guess this is good news for Voyager fans . Thanks go out to both Karens for this info . <p> It seems that the global literati includes at least one Star Trek fan who 's not ashamed to admit it . Salman Rushdie , author of Midnight 's Children and The Satanic Verses , has cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His short story Chekhov and Zulu , published in the anthology East , West , depicts two Indian diplomats and their involvement in espionage in England . From their days as schoolboys , the characters are nicknamed after Mr. Chekhov and Mr. Sulu , and the story is filled with the jargon of the original series , presented in a way that 's playful , not condescending . As is typical in Rushdie 's work , not only do cultures merge and overlap , but so do pop cultures : the Star Trek references occur alongside mentions of The Lord of the Rings . <p> Rushdie 's love for Trek is also apparent in his latest novel , ' The Ground Beneath Her Feet , ' in which the Next Generation is mentioned . To find out about that ( and read the actual quote from the novel ) , you 'll have to read the full article at Warp Eleven , though . <p> Remember that this ' news ' is either made up or exaggerated , and is only put on that teletext page to make people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here only for its amusement value . As in ' Haha . ' <p> DS9 Finale Press ReleaseChristian ( 1:29 pm CST ) NOTE : Spoilers for DS9 's ' What You Leave Behind ' can be found in this update . Here is where you need to click to avoid reading those spoilers . <p> It appears Vidiot is trying to kill me , as he just put up the press release for ' What You Leave Behind , ' the DS9 finale . Take a look at the official synopsis : <p> On the eve of battle , Bashir aaaand Exri spend the night together . Later , with Sisko in command , the Defiant joins the **26;580;TOOLONG fleet as the invasion of Cardassia is launched . On Cardassia Prime , Kira , Damar and Garak discuss Resistance plans to sabotage the Dominion 's power and communication centers . On Bajor , Kai Winn asks Dukat to join her when she releases the Pah-wraiths from the Fire Caves , and Dukat vows to destroy Sisko . <p> The Collective announced today Myscha the Sled Dog , known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is now joining The Collective - developer of Star Trek Deep Space Nine : The Fallen . He joins as Level Design Director at the Collective and will begin working to further enhance the level designs on their internal projects , including The Fallen . <p> " Myscha shares the same passion we have for crafting exceptional content , " said Richard Hare , Vice President and Creative Director of The Collective . " Upon seeing the quality of our staff 's work , and the direction we are taking our titles , he realized he wanted to become part of our group and lend his considerable talents to our games . " <p> Myscha commented , " I am extremely excited about my new position as Level Design Director at The Collective . With Unreal technology forming the foundation for ' Star Trek : DS9 - The Fallen , ' my goal is to return to my passion for innovative single player game design combined with cutting edge third and first person action , unique gameplay , and breathtaking architecture . The talent at The Collective is first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company execs , you can expect some truly awesome games coming from us in the near future . " <p> This could well help elevate the Collective to a much higher status - Myscha ( whose actual name is T. Elliot Cannon ) is generally regarded as one of the best level designers around , and ' The Fallen ' should definitely benefit from his experience . <p> ' Emissary ' AuctionChristian ( 1:16 pm CST ) Emissary , the official fan club of Avery Brooks ( Benjamin Sisko ) , has announced a rather large online charity auction , which will benefit the College Fund UNCF . Close to 90 items can be bid on , including autographed scripts , photos , trading cards , figures , and lots of other items . The bidding will start on the 1st of June , and end on the 30th of June - if you want to participate , you can find the full list of items and info on how to bid here . <p> In other Avery Brooks news , the fan club is reporting on what he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxing back at home in New Jersey , look for him to do more in the theater and with music . As soon as we get the news about what he 's up to next , we 'll post it here . <p> If you 're really desperate to see more of Brooks , his series ' Spenser : For Hire ' has started airing ' sporadically ' on TNT - find the full listings here . Thanks go out to Emissary for reporting all this on their news page . <p> Mr. Video Productions has posted the official press release for ' The Dogs Of War , ' the 8th Final Chapter episode . Take a look at the official synopsis that 's included with that episode : <p> While Sisko takes command of a new ship named in honor of the Defiant , Kira , Garak and Damar barely escape a Dominion ambush on Cardassia and are forced into hiding . Quark receives a static-filled messade from Grand Nagus Zek , the Ferengi leader , that he 's been named Zek 's successor . Now cured of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was infected by Section Thirty-one - an unsanctioned extremist organization within the Federation - but promises Sisko he wo n't take matters into his own hands . <p> Do n't forget--Star Trek : Insurrection will be available in US stores tomorrow . At this point , you can only rent VHS copies of the film ( unless you happen to have $88.39 lying around , that is ) --the video wo n't be available at a reasonable price until November 16 . However , the DVD version of the film , which will include trailer(s) and a " behind-the-scenes featurette , " will be available for purchase tomorrow at a pretty reasonable $30.00 or less . <p> And , of course , it 'll still be a few months before the video makes its way to the Netherlands . Sigh . <p> Mr. Video Productions has put up the official press release for DS9 's ' Extreme Measures , ' the 7th Final Chapter episode . As usual , this press release also contains a synopsis of the episode : <p> When Kira brings a terminally i 'll Odo back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave him and return to help the Cardassian Resistance . Later , O'Brien and Bashir inform Sisko of their plan to lure a Section Thirty-one operative , who may hold the cure to Odo 's disease , to the station . The scheme works when Sloan , the director of the unsanctioned Starfleet extremist organization that infected Odo - as part of a genocidal plot against his people - arrives . But when Bashir places a Romulan mind probe on the agent , who refuses to give information regarding a cure , Sloan attempts suicide in the science lab by activating a neuro-depolarizing device in his brain . <p> The full press release also contains a full list of guest stars , plus the TV Guide ads . Of course , as I write this Vidiot 's server is down , so you might want to check out the Psi Phi version instead , even though it contains slightly less info . Alternatively , you might want to check out our own spoiler-packed report of the episode , which insider Faith was kind enough to send us yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' has already ended its run in the US and most European countries , there are still a few countries where the movie started just a few days ago . One of those countries is Japan , where the movie premiered on Saturday , the 8th of May . The Flagship received a mail from Robert Grey , who lives in Japan and had the following to say about the release : <p> Attached is a JPG file of the poster design that you can see here in Japan . The horizontal line in white at the top roughly translates as " Every planet has it 's first episode ... " The vertical line in yellow on the left translates as " Their 's was to become the enemy of the entire universe ! " In red print , it mentions that this movie was a #1 hit in the U.S. ( was it ? A lot of American films here are advertised as being -- literally translated " All-American No.1 Big Hit ! ! " ) . Then , at the bottom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it says ' 20th Anniversary STAR TREK Insurrection . ' The " 20th Anniversary " refers to the Trek movie series . Then , of course , at the bottom , the cast and production credits are listed ( in Japanese ) . <p> I saw the film today , this being the second time . The first time was in NYC back in December , when I was home for the holidays . This time , though , I was the only person in the entire place laughing at some of the jokes . I guess they do n't translate very well . Then again , Japanese movie theatres tend to have an atmosphere like a funeral home -- nobody makes a sound throughout the whole thing . <p> More of Robert Grey 's report and a larger version of the movie poster can be found at the Flagships ' news page . Meanwhile , an overseas box office report written by Phillippe Cahill for Reuters/Variety mentions the following : <p> Nearing the end of its run , Star Trek : Insurrection ' ' had a moderate third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also bowed rowdily in Sweden with $149,734 , up 90% on Star Trek : First Contact . ' ' <p> The full report can be found here , and also includes some info on ' American History X , ' the movie which starred several Trek stars . <p> I think that 's going to depend in large part on the viewer and what they bring to the film . Obviously your reaction to any movie is going to depend on you , but the best films manage to impart an universal truth about experience even while staying specific to the characters and milieu onscreen . That 's only partially the case here , as much of the film 's humor is specific to not just the world of fandom , but the world of LA industry insider fandom . <p> That 's not to say the film does n't have plenty of comic charm . Rafer Weigel and Eric McCormack ( who plays Will on NBC 's WILL &amp; GRACE ) have an easy , natural chemistry that goes a long way toward selling the picture as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnett , and it 's no coincidence that the lead characters in the film are named Mark ( McCormack ) and Robert ( Weigel ) . The actors work so well together that they convince us of their friendship , one of the key elements of the film . In addition , Weigel strikes some real sparks with his love interest Claire ( Audie England , both sexy and approachable here ) , grounding another major element of the film . <p> The rest of the report also talks about William Shatner 's appearance in the movie , and even tells us why we should all go and see the movie ( something I was planning to do anyway ) . Go and check out the full report ! <p> If I may segue into soapbox mode ( as I often do ) , since when did the U.S.S. Voyager have an elite force ? I 'm assuming that this title refers to the security team , due to the nature of the game . Since Intrepid class ships are basically high-speed science vessels , where does the crack team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe it 's a Maquis team . They should be good with guns , given their nature . In any event , I 'll just chalk this one up to the Braga school of Star Trek lore . If it blows up , it makes good Trek . <p> Personally I still think that the game will be pretty good , considering it 's being developed by Raven , who I respect a lot . We should know more after this week 's E3 , though .

' At the meeting , he was able to talk to Mojo of Foundation Imaging , and learned the following : <p> I then asked him if he new anything about the story lines for season 6 voyager . He then told me that there will be an episode where voyager is captured by aliens and is then taken apart , so he said that they were still making up the story lines but he does n't think that they would get rid of this episode. ( sounds great ) <p> Even though I 'm not sure how reliable this is , it still sounds rather interesting . Find more at the Universe 's Voyager news page . <p> Delta Blues Reviews ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues just put up his review of ' 11:59 , ' last week 's new Voyager episode . With 4 out of a possible 5 stars , the episode was well received , quite probably because Wright noticed some striking parallels between this episode and several other great ones from Trek history : <p> I saw this episode as Janeway 's " Inner Light " or " The Visitor , " and a companion to " Living Witness . " And an analogue of " Tomorrow is Yesterday " ( remember Captain Christopher ? ) <p> ' Strange Bedfellows ' CreditsChristian ( 1:47 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi just posted the full credits list for ' Strange Bedfellows , ' the third DS9 Final Chapter episode . As usual , the credits show you everyone who worked on the episode , both on screen and behind the scenes . You can find the credit listing by going here . <p> " When It Rains ... " was a bit frustrating , but I suspect that 's mostly in comparison to the last four weeks , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " When It Rains ... " which are superb ( one storyline in particular ) , other pieces feel somewhat padded out to keep things going . <p> Essentially , " When It Rains ... " is a bit of a lull ; while there 's little about it which seems bad , a lot of it feels more like marking time than anything else . The Section 31 material and the Winn/Dukat material are extremely promising , and much of the rest might turn out well--but for now , this one felt more " okay " than wonderful . <p> With a 6.5 , this certainly was a disappointing episode for Lynch . Find a more detailed analysis here . <p> SFX Interviews Hans BeimlerChristian ( 1:44 pm CST ) The Great Link has re-printed a short interview with DS9 writer Hans Beimler , which first appeared in the British SFX Magazine . Here 's a short quote from the interview , in which Beimler talks about how the show evolved over the past seven years : <p> SFX:Ira S. Behr has said that if you were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Emissary " up next to the finale , it would very much be a straight line from point A to point Z. <p> Hans Beimler : " It 's a straight line we discovered looking back , " Beimler says , " We did n't know where we were going until we got there . It was only a straight line once we looked back . This finale was not the plan all along . We really were keeping options open , discovering the series as we went along . There was a vague notion of what we wanted to do . I do n't know if anyone has mentioned this , but the original mission was to bring Bajor into the Federation . That 's not even mentioned in the finale . The show has really had a life of its own . " <p> Check out the full interview for more , including some pretty major ' What You Leave Behind ' spoilers . <p> Trek Book NewsChristian ( 1:44 pm CST ) Some more new Star Trek book info is now available at John Ordover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with several new responses . Take a look at two of the most interesting questions and answers : <p> Query from : Brian How many books will Starfleet:Year One run in ? Will it run as a continuing serial or does it have a predetermined ending point ? How many of the New Frontier crew will be appearing in the Double Helix book ? <p> Response from : John Ordover It 'll run as a serial in 12 books . All of the NF cast make an appearance . <p> Response from : John Ordover We only did one DS9 hardcover , because sales of the paperbacks in the line do n't justify hardcover publication . <p> Considering that one hardcover ( ' Warped ' ) was also one of the worst Trek books imaginable , perhaps it 's actually a good thing they wo n't be publishing more DS9 hardcovers . Anyway , more John Ordover responses can be found here . <p> ' Strange Bedfellows ' 14th Syndicated ShowChristian ( 1:44 pm CST ) A report from Variety is saying that , for the week which ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Nine ' occupied the 14th place in the 20 top-rated syndicated TV shows .

Christian ( 1:42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something witty and intelligent I could mention here at ' Hello World ! ' Unfortunately I 'm now faced with a headache the size of a Romulan Warbird and I forgot about it , so I guess it 'll have to wait until tomorrow . <p> Update , 21:30 CET : Long live aspirine . I just recalled one of the things I wanted to mention . There is something I 'd like to verify regarding the Voyager cuts - apparently this is only happening in the US , and not in Canada . Are there any Canadians who can confirm this ? Are you still getting the full , uncut versions of the Voyager episodes ? If so , please let me know . <p> Sunday May 9 , 1999 <p> Extreme Measures PreviewChristian ( 2:52 pm CST ) Star Trek Interactive has just put up the trailers for ' Extreme Measures , ' the 7th DS9 Final Chapter episode . As usual , the preview can be found not only as an MPEG video clip , but also as an ASF video , MP3 audio files , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new trailers by going here , while they 'll probably also be available soon at Mr. Video Productions . <p> Some good news and some bad this week . On BBC2 , TNG again continued to climb from its ratings slump earlier in the month . This week 's episode " Man of the People " gained an extra 50,000 viewers over last week . However , the DS9 news is bad again - the first season reruns failed to pick up where they left off last week , and DS9 was once again off the top 30 with an audience of below 2.13m . But Voyager , which returned for this week with " Mortal Coil " , with a respectful #26 , 2.27m rating - not as good as " Concerning Flight " from a fortnight ago , but nevertheless good considering Voyager 's poor scheduling . <p> Over on Sky 1 , the new Voyager season started reasonably well , ranking joint fifth with The Simpsons . <p> More ( including a lovely graph showing the historical positions for TNG and DS9 ) can be found by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hit television show Star Trek Deep Space Nine , will be at this year 's Electronic Entertainment Expo to sign autographs for fans . <p> deBoer will also be on hand to promote S&amp;SI 's upcoming game , Star Trek Deep Space Nine : The Fallen - being called the " ultimate Star Trek game " by the company . The game is based on the Deep Space Nine television series and will feature many of the characters that fans adore . Star Trek Deep Space Nine : The Fallen will ship this fall for the Mac and PC ( Windows 98/95 ) , and will be distributed by GT Interactive . <p> Considering E3 is only open to gaming development teams , publishers , members of the press and especially invited people , the chances of you being able to get in are , unfortunately , rather low : - ( / . <p> I believe Starfleet Emergency equipment is designed to work without warp or impulse power on line--using old fashioned mechanical and chemical energy . After all , it the dissipators drained all energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The Breen weapon ( as far as we 've been able to tell ) has gaps in its energy absorption spectrum . <p> This is the type of episode that 's all atmosphere and minimal substance . With perhaps one key exception , what substance we have is mostly unmistakably obvious , with the lesson telegraphed far in advance . But that does n't really matter too much , because " Juggernaut " is an hour sold almost completely on performance , direction , and production values . The only real mystery here : How did it require three writers to come up with such a bare-boned story ? <p> " Juggernaut " is n't bad ; it 's just really , really simple . It 's B-movie action/adventure , with 20th-century themes that look like they were purchased at a bargain store . Maybe I 'm somewhat spoiled right now with the deeply layered story arc of Deep Space Nine currently unfolding , but I think Voyager can dig a little deeper than this . <p> Jamahl is a lot more impressed with ' Someone To Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4 stars : <p> " Someone to Watch Over Me " is a human comedy with a ring of truth . The concept behind the story is relatively simple : Seven of Nine takes dating lessons . The result is an hour that takes many of the expected comic paths in ways that are impressively sincere , and also finds a bittersweet undercurrent that leaves one charmed . It 's a straightforward story well conceived by Brannon Braga and well told by Michael Taylor , in probably the latter 's best work of the season . <p> ' 11:59 ' Credits ListChristian ( 2:17 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi has put up the credits list for last week 's new Voyager episode , ' 11:59 . ' The credits list is a complete transcript of all the credits as they appeared on-screen , and offer you the chance to see precisely who worked on this episode . You can find the credits list by going here . <p> Last 3 DS9 Episodes CreditsChristian ( 2:16 pm CST ) Today I spoke again with insider Faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Nine Final Chapter episodes . Faith was kind enough to provide me with some ( non-spoiler ) info on the three scripts : <p> What You Leave Behind -Written by Ira Steven Behr &amp; Hans Beimler -Directed by Allan Kroeker -Final Draft March 26 , 1999 , but " it went through quite a few revisions on top of that , from 3/26-4/7 , at least based on what 's listed here . " <p> Although some of this info was already known ( most notable the directors and some of the writers ) , this still is rather interesting info , and major thanks go out to Faith for providing this . <p> In the 2nd issue of Star Trek The Magazine on page 87 in the last paragraph of an article about Dorothy Fontana , Spock , the Vulcans and Romulans it mentions Vulcan 's Fury and its problems and reports that Fontana MAY HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO A NOVEL . Is there something going on here we do n't know ? <p> A little while later , Pocket Books editor John Ordover responded to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I 'm in touch with Ms. Fontana and we 've discussed a totally different project . VF has too many complications. : ) <p> Although it 's great to hear that Fontana ( who used to write for the Original Series , the Animated Series and the Next Generation ) will perhaps be writing ( another ) Trek novel , it 's still a pity to hear the Vulcan Fury project now seems completely dead . More on this as I get to hear it . <p> Paramount impresses with the DVD release of Star Trek : Insurrection . The 2.35x1 widescreen image is 16x9 enhanced once again , which is a sure sign that Paramount has been listening to our feedback . The picture quality is excellent , especially the outdoor mountain scenery . Bright exteriors are contrasted with dark space , and color and contrast hold true throughout , with enhanced resolution thanks to the anamorphic encoding ( and no loss of resolution for 4x3 downconversion , if compared to a non-anamorphic transfer ) . A 4x3 transfer would also been nice for those people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Paramount releases will include this as well . <p> The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is outstanding , with many instances of 360-degree sound . For example , when the crew of the Enterprise escorts the Ba'ku people up the mountain , it sounds like you are outside on a breezy day . When Picard and one of the Son'a enter an elevator , you hear it close behind you . When a laser gun battle ensues , shots are fired and land in all directions . This is why I like the multi-channel sound provided by Dolby Digital . <p> The review also mentions that the DVD contains a short making-of featurette , which is something I had n't heard about before . You can find the full review , written by Steve Tannehill by going here . Thanks go out to Jeffrey Koga for pointing me to this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 2:15 pm CST ) -Tonight at 18:45 BST , BBC Two will be showing Voyager 's ' Waking Moments .

Or is this only a problem with American Trekkers , as humble me added to that ? Feel free to tell me why I am so utterly wrong by going here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 2:14 pm CST ) Today I heard about one of the most sickening things imaginable . The Dutch television station Veronica , apparently desperate for high ratings , will soon introduce a new type of reality tv . For this show , they 'll invite 8 persons , who will have to live in a special house for a period of three months . During that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world - they wo n't have access to television , radio or newspapers . They 'll even grow their own vegetables to eat . <p> Everywhere in that house , in every room , the station wil place cameras , and every day they 'll devote 30 minutes of airtime to what happened with those 8 people . On Thursdays , they 'll have an extra-long show in which their behaviour will be analyzed by a team of psychologists . Is there anyone else who thinks this is incredibly sick and twisted ? <p> Saturday May 8 , 1999 <p> Special ' Experience ' EventsChristian ( 2:44 pm CST ) Sorry for not reporting this earlier - it has been sitting in my mailbox for a few days now , but I completely forgot about it . Anyway , the people at the Star Trek Experience are reporting that some special events will be taking place at the Vegas Trek attraction over the next few months : <p> May 20 , 1999--The writers and producers of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine will meet fans and sign autographs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " General Martok , " and Patrick Massett , " Duras , " will sign autographs from 3-4:30 p.m . There will be chances for several contest winners to go on the ' Voyage Through Space ' with the actors . Then enjoy a " Feast with the Warriors " from 6-8 p.m. in Quark 's Bar &amp; Restaurant complete with a Klingon buffet serving delicacies such as " Rokeg Blood Pie " and " Slimy Tongue Balls " ! The cost is $94.95 per person and includes the buffet dinner with the actors , two drink tickets , one ticket for the ' Voyage Through Space ' , and the " Empire Party " that will continue after the " Feast with the Warriors " buffet from 8-11 p.m . The " Empire Party " will have a DJ , dancing , prizes and drink specials . If you purchase your tickets in advance the price is reduced to $74.95 per person . There will be a $10 cover charge for guests that only attend the " Empire Party . " To make reservations for the " Feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> July 17 , 1999--Aron Eisenberg , " Ensign Nog , " and Cecily Adams , " Moogie , " of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine will make appearances from 1:30-2:30p.m. and 3:30-4:30p.m . <p> All of the above activities will take place in Quark 's Bar . More information on this can be obtained by calling 702-697-8751 . <p> Loonygames Rsven ArticleChristian ( 2:16 pm CST ) Jason " loonyboi " Bergman , editor-in-chief at Loonygames , just uploaded part three of his massive Inside Raven Software feature . The feature describes every aspect of the game developer 's history , and even includes a few short quotes on the upcoming ' Voyager Hazard Team ' game : <p> There are so many horror stories about working on anything Star Trek related . What 's Raven 's experience been like ? Apparently , they 've had no problems . " I was worried about that , " Brian Raffel explained . " But they realized that they should give us free reign . And we 've already come up with some unique things that they 've seen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While Paramount might be giving them plenty of room , the fans wo n't be so forgiving , as Brian Pelletier pointed out . " We want to have free reign , we want to say , ' yeah , it 's a licensed product , but we 're just going to do what we want to do . ' We want to make this really cool action gamebut , it 's Star Trek . So we really have to make sure we please those Star Trek fans . Not just the action gaming fans , but the Star Trek fans . It is a balance , and that 's going to be the main issue here , trying to get that right balance . I actually look forward to it . " <p> You can find the full feature by going here , and , while you 're there , I 'd advise you to check out the rest of the site as well - it 's one of my personal favourites . <p> B5 Creator Continues Trek CriticismChristian ( 1:31 pm CST ) In the **33;608;TOOLONG newsgroup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deep Space Nine , as he reacted to a post by IslanderUK , who had some comments about Straczynski 's earlier statements . IslanderUK mentioned how he remembered that DS9 began showing 6 weeks before the B5 pilot aired , to which Straczynsky replied : <p> Yeah , they pushed through their post production specifically to beat us into the marketplace . <p> IslanderUK was also surprised that Straczynski never actually started legal action for plagiarism , but according to Straczynski that was n't his fault : <p> It was discussed with WB for some time , but they felt that it would be like getting into a protrated land war in Asia , and the litigation might prevent B5 from getting a fair shot by being embroiled in a conflict right out of the gate . <p> The last exchange is especially interesting : <p> IslanderUK : " As far as stealing your car is concerned , if your car was stolen you would not have use of it . You still retained use of the B5 idea and the fact that it is similar to DS9 did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it almost did . WB came within an inch of canceling the whole thing because they were n't sure the market could sustain two space station series . It also hurt us in that fans thought that *we* were the copycats , since we aired second . And Paramount played a lot of games with the stations to try and keep us off the air so they 'd have the field to themselves . It took us almost two years to really recover from the damage , it 's still an annoyance that we seem to be providing DS9 with R&amp;D free of charge , and we still have a lot of fans who think we copied them since our pilot aired second . <p> I suppose I 'm biased in favour of Trek , but I would have liked to see Straczynski actually explaining some of his accusations , instead of just randomly attacking Paramount . Meanwhile , if you also have something to say about this matter , we still have a thread running about this at the Trek BBS - you can find it here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussed and worried about Kira getting along with Dumb-Ar and his merry men , everyone seemed to forget that Garak has a score to settle with the Dumb One , as well , and that he is not exactly Cardassia 's favorite son to begin with . You 'd think his presence in Dumb-Ar 's camp would be nearly as unwelcome as Kira 's . And speaking of Dumb-Ar , I think the writers may have forgotten some of his back-story . Wooden says Dumb-Ar is a conventional soldier with no experience in guerilla warfare . Hello ? I seem to recall him serving on Dukat 's renegade Bird of Prey for about a year and a half , fighting a guerilla war against the Klingons . Not a huge discontinuity , but a discontinuity nonetheless . <p> Sometimes I wish the Cynic would provide a cast list with his reviews - I think I 've lost track of all the Dumb Ones and Dumb-Ars etc . Find the full review here . <p> News On New Trek ToysChristian ( 1:29 pm CST ) The Raving Toy Maniac has updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First up is the news that New Force Comics and Collectibles will soon be selling a special ' Captain Kathryn Janeway From the Episode " ' Flashback " ' figure , which will be based on the head of Janeway and the body of Saavik , quite probably in order to save on the costs . The figure will probably end up costing around $7.99 - $8.99 , and you can already place orders by going here.I guess I 'm feeling rather bored : - ) . Secondly , some extra news is available on Target 's upcoming 5 " figures , which shows again which character really is the most popular in the world of Trek : <p> The second wave of Target Exclusive 5 " figures should be available in the next couple of weeks . In a suprisingly intelligent move , the packing ratio for this assortment will be 5 Seven of Nines to 3 Datas , making the undeniable hot figure of this assortment easier to find and decreasing the chance that Data will become a pegwarmer . <p> Lastly , the Toy Maniac is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is available , the monthly column in which a Playmates representative answers all your questions . She also provides us with lots of new info on the various upcoming 12 " figures , so you might want to check out the new edition . <p> Again , if you want to avoid reading spoilers for ' Relativity ' I 'd advise you to click here . <p> The Star Trek Universe has posted a convention report by John Richards , who recently visited the British Supernova 99 convention . Several Trek actors attended the convention , but also Mojo from special effects company Foundation Imaging , who had some interesting news bits : <p> Mojo from Foundation Imaging brought along some new footage from the upcoming Voyager episode Relativity , a brilliant scene of the Utopia Planitia shipyards - the scene shows ships in different stages of construction with Voyager nearly finished . It 's a pretty good scene . The pull-back shot is fantastic ! ! - there 's a ship with its saucer section in the midst of construction at the beginning of the shot and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction underway ! - it 's a must see shot ! <p> Also , Mojo said that they 'd done a test reel of Voyagers captains yacht dropping away from the ship but because of the whole Insurrection Captains Yacht business , the Voyager producers did n't want to take the thunder away from Movie ! . <p> The full report also contains info on the final DS9 scene and on several recent rumours . Find it all here . <p> German Television Station InterviewedChristian ( 1:27 pm CST ) The German Star Trek Index is reporting that a new edition of ' Trek Minds , ' the online radio show , is now available . This edition is actually a rather special one , as representatives from the German television station Sat.1 are interviewed , and give their opinion on the recent problems with Voyager in Germany . You can find the latest edition of the radio show by going here , but remember that the show itself is actually in German . <p> ' Warhead ' Partial Press ReleaseChristian ( 1:27 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for Voyager 's ' Warhead , ' the penultimate episode of the season . In the press release , you 'll be able to find the full creative staff , plus some info on the guest stars . It is interesting to note that the only currently listed guest star , McKenzie Westmore , also had a role in ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' as a Ba'ku woman . Find the full partial press release here : - ) . <p> I have had a full synopsis for " What You Leave Behind " for a while now . Out of consideration for the writers have not published it , but now TrekWeb has scooped me and published a full synopsis . This is a bit of dent to my pride but I have now typed up the whole thing and it 's on-line ... Go there and be spoiled ... <p> As I mentioned for the two other synopses , you probably do n't want to read the synopsis if you still want to enjoy the episode . However , if you really want to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeri Ryan Talk Show AppearanceChristian ( 1:25 pm CST ) The Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage is reporting that Jeri Ryan will be appearing on the Paramount-produced ' Howie Mandel Show ' this Wednesday , May 12 . The Howie Mandel Show can be seen in 95 % of the country , according to the official home page , so you probably will be able to see it . Unfortunately for Mandel , Ryan will probably be one of his last guests , as his show will be cancelled near the end of May .

Christian ( 1:22 pm CST ) I guess displaying my e-mail address out in the open on this site was n't such a good idea as I initially thought . On the one hand the people who need it do n't use it ( christian@trekzone.net is what the correct address should be - most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand I 'm getting spammed more and more . For a while now , I 've even been receiving a spam from Russia ! In Russian , no less . Unfortunately , I 've got no idea how to say ' abuse@ ' in Russian , so I guess I 'll have to live with those spams until my next address change : - ) . <p> REVELATION OF THE WEEK : Well , we were promised a " dark secret " regarding Janeway 's ancestor , and I guess we got one : she was a spammer . I had to laugh at the notion of " emailing everyone within 100 miles " though . I think Braga and Menosky are a little Unclear on the Concept of email . <p> TGL received information for this episode a few weeks ago . I was intending to release these spoiler snippets a lot closer to the airdate of " What you Leave Behind " . However , there is much information about the finale online now that I figured that the chances of other sites releasing more information about the episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in mind , I figured ' What the hell ? ' <p> A lot of major plot points are revealed in the Great Link 's report , so you probably will not want to read it . There is , however , one news snippet I just had to include : <p> We learn that Morn is friends with Admiral Ross , and has dinner regularly with Captain Sisko . <p> You can find all the info by going here , but , again , if you still want to enjoy the finale I 'd strongly advise you NOT to go there . <p> DS9 TV Guide Issue ConfirmedChristian ( 12:55 pm CST ) Thanks to insider Faith , yesterday we were able to report that TV Guide will be publishing a special DS9-centered issue in the week ' What You Leave Behind ' will be airing . Today I received confirmation from TV Guide that this will actually be happening : <p> Our records indicate that the week of 5/29/99 , there will be 4 covers commemorating the ' DS9 ' series finale . We do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yesterday , Faith did have a few thoughts on who would feature on these covers : <p> As for the covers themselves , my best guess is that #1 will feature Captain Benjamin and Jake Sisko , #2 will feature Odo and Kira , #3 will feature O'Brien and Bashir , and #4 will feature Dax , Worf , and Quark . <p> Keep in mind that these covers have n't yet been confirmed , so the above info should be taken as pure speculation . Furthermore , they might actually still change , as Holly Kim Wilson , charity coordinator of the official Marc Alaimo fan club , just sent me the following info : <p> We 're sort of starting an e-mail campaign to add Dukat , Damar , and Weyoun as potential cover boys . If anyone wants to help , just have them go to TV Guide 's site at www.tvguide.com and post a polite request to add a Dukat , Damar , and Weyoun cover to the list . <p> In any case , whoever makes the covers , this is absolutely wonderful news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Leave Behind ' will almost certainly be a lot higher now TV Guide is so prominently backing the show . <p> William Shatner competes at the Del Mar Horse Show May 7 - 9 , 1999 . This is all the information we have been given at this time . His Saddlebreds are exquisitely beautiful and always show well . <p> If all goes well , I 'll be reporting on Shatner 's results over the next few days , thanks to The Saddle Horse Report . Of course , if someone who knows more about horses than me , and who is actually able to interpret the results correctly , would like to take over and send in reports on this , I 'd more than love to hear from you . <p> " Someone to Watch Over Me " performed lower than its overnight would have indicated , earning a 3.4 rating , 5 share . That 's down from the season average for the show and also down 13% from last year 's " Living Witness . " That rating doubled " Juggernaut " ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last first-run in Voyager 's usual timeslot , " Think Tank . " <p> Wednesday 's ' 11:59 ' seems to have done slightly better : <p> " 11:59 " performed quite well to open sweeps for Voyager , roping a 5.6 rating , 8 share . That 's up a tenth of a ratings point from last week 's " Someone to Watch Over Me " and is average for the season to date . In the timeslot , " Charmed " stayed just barely ahead of Voyager , earning a 5.7/8 . That left " 11:59 " in 6th with Fox in fourth for the 8-9 hour . " Seven Days " performed well above average , helping UPN 's average for the night , turning in a 4.0 . <p> As I said last week , this a pretty good looking overnight ( although when I said it last week , it translated into a pretty disappointing national rating , so you never know ) . The show seems to be back on track , but the national numbers will be the first to determine that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndicated dramas , " ' Til Death Do Us Part " saw a dip from last week , falling to a 4.1 rating , ranking 14th . With that , this episode joins nearly half a dozen others which hold DS9 's lowest rating achieved in a firstrun episode . " ' Til Death " was also down from last week 's " Penumbra " and last year 's " In the Pale Moonlight . " <p> Xena and Hercules also ran new episodes this week , but niether managed to crack the top 25 , which places DS9 at the top of the syndicated weekly dramas . It was a pretty bad week for syndication in general , which could have contributed to the lower rating . More can be found in the full reports for ' Someone To Watch Over Me ' , ' 11:59 ' and ' Til Death Do Us Part ' . <p> More on BotF Going GoldChristian ( 12:53 pm CST ) FedCom , the ' Birth of the Federation ' news site , has received an e-mail from Jeff Holzhauer , the producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has some disappointing news for European BotF fans such as myself : <p> Yes BotF has gone gold , the US version anyway . Additionally , the ship date has been moved up a week . It will now launch ( in the US ) on May 18th . <p> The German version has not gone gold . That means that currently the UK/German joint disk will be a week later than originally planned . This date may change if Hasbro UK decides to ship a UK version only , which would speed up the UK date , or we do n't master German by this weekend , which would further delay the international release . <p> Just when I was hoping I would *finally* get my hands on a piece of Trek before the Americans . Sigh . <p> I may have to revoke my previous comments that this entire arc has been nothing short of excellent . I was all excited for this one because it looked like a great , classic Kira episode -- you know , send her into a tough situation where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , we 've got too many threads going on here , all of which are worthy , but the writers could have focused on one or two and let the others just sort of carry on in the background .

He 's all crabby and ... what do you mean Odo 's infected too ? When did that ... oooh , Dukat ! Blind ! Can I go on the ferris wheel ?

The report immediately begins with a rather surprising bit of new info : <p> Your training missions are conducted by Captain Sulu himself ! He teaches you the basics of how to fly your ship , and at one point I even got to get into a little fight with him . Yeah , right ! I 'm in a wimpy Constitution Class ship , and he comes barreling at me in his Excelsior . Needless to say , my butt was extremely kicked . Several times . Then it just got worse .

Most of the article is , understandably , dedicated to her role on Voyager , including the below quote dealing with her make-up experiences : <p> " I get asked how long the makeup takes a lot , and the answer is ten minutes , " Pomers noted last week after completing work on Voyager 's season finale .

Christian ( 12:48 pm CST ) Something which I thought was extremely clear ( and probably is to most of you ) , but - I am NOT involved in any way in the production of Star Trek . Over the past few weeks I have received several mails from people complimenting me on the show , or asking me for autographed photos of actors , but , I repeat , I have n't got anything to do with the show . If you want to send comments to the people who actually create the show , I suggest you visit the Continuum , which is the official site . <p> Thursday May 6 , 1999 <p> TV Guide To Focus On DS9Christian ( 2:49 pm CST ) Today , I got contacted by ' Faith ' , another source who is close to Paramount ( it must be my lucky week ! : - ) . Faith sent me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What You Leave Behind ' will feature four different TV Guide covers featuring the DS9 cast - a treatment that 's long since overdue since I have hardly seen a peep from the mainstream media about DS9 ending - particularly when shows like Home Improvement , Mad About You , Melrose Place , and The Nanny are all ending in May ( and getting much more press since they 're network shows . ) <p> As for the covers themselves , my best guess is that #1 will feature Captain Benjamin and Jake Sisko , #2 will feature Odo and Kira , #3 will feature O'Brien and Bashir , and #4 will feature Dax , Worf , and Quark . <p> If this news is true , it would certainly be wonderful news for Deep Space Nine - certainly more people would tune in to watch ' What You Leave Behind , ' which can only be good for Star Trek 's future .

It was only 0.1 lower Charmed that aired on WB , and since WB can be seen in 85% of USA and UPN only in 73% , it 's an okay result . 7 Days got a 4.0 , that was up 0.5 from last week .

' Christian ( 11:58 am CST ) Ted Witt just posted his review of DS9 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discussion Boards , beginning , just like Mania'sMichelle Erica Green with the obligatory ' It Pours ' joke . That does n't mean that his review is completely the same as Green 's review , as he seems to be a lot more positive about the episode : <p> In some ways , this latest episode is a quiet prelude , the redevelopment of the main themes of the Final Chapter 's grand symphony . There is no direct conclusions , no grand finale , no explosions . We have variations of some older themes and development of newer ones . Unlike some of the previous episodes dissonance between scenes , clashing of chords , movement too quickly between motifs , this episode has , in my opinion , some of the nicest harmonizing and plotting yet . The episode does not seem rushed at all . It builds nicely , all the while containing and anticipating the dramatic conclusions just weeks away . It is a very nice episode . <p> The full review also contains a detailed synopsis of the episode , more analysis , and the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face Of Evil ! ' *This* episode , meanwhile , receives an A- , as you can read in the full review . <p> Mania Reviews ' 11:59'Christian ( 11:57 am CST ) Besides her ' When It Rains ... ' review , Mania'sMichelle Erica Green also put up her review of Voyager 's ' 11:59 , ' which she seems to like even more than the DS9 episode : <p> There are two reviews I could write about " 11:59 . " One is about how wonderful it was to see Kate Mulgrew get to play a character with some depth and dimension , an offbeat sense of humor , some human warmth , some weaknesses which make her seem to be growing as a person instead of falling apart . The other is about what a silly episode this was , inconsistent with previous Star Trek history and Janeway history , slow-paced , entirely predictable . Sadly , given the kind of season Voyager has had , I 'm inclined to stick with the former , because despite the latter I enjoyed this episode very much . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home Mulgrew seemed in the captain 's chair ( which Picard and Sisko did not , at first ) ; now , however , it strikes me how much more comfortable she seems in a bar or a bookstore . This performance was so natural that I kept forgetting I was watching a fictional character . Her interactions with both Henry and Jason Janeway were low-key , witty , genuine , with none of the forced maternal gestures we get from Kathryn Janeway and no captain-like posturing we 've seen increasingly in the past two seasons ; some of that relaxation crossed over into the final scenes , which I liked very much , and I hope the trend stays . She looked like she was enjoying this episode , and she was in virtually every scene so it must have been a long shooting week - even if the plot had silly anachronistic moments , I 'd rather watch good dialogue than technobabble any day . <p> Query from : Andrew John : If it takes nine to eighteen months to write , publish &amp; ship a Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started writing the DS9 finale in October of 1998 ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Novelizations are an entirely different matter .

If you really want to remain completely spoiler-free for the finale , click here to move on . <p> Again , click here to avoid reading spoilers for ' What You Leave Behind .

Take a look at what reviewer Steve Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege to read the script to the final episode of DS9 . Because of exams and general hectic-ness I 've not been able to tell you my thoughts on it . Well I still have exams , but since this is the final episode after all ... <p> The writers may be mad that we got it , nonetheless that I 'm now telling everyone about it . Unfortunately , ' t is the nature of our business . Scripts get out all the time . People want to know what happens . It should be a testament to the fact that so many people care that I 'm bothering to do what I am doing right now . It certainly is not an attempt to undermine a show that in any regard is ending . At the end of the day what is written on the page speaks for itself , whether you know about it now or in the first week of June . <p> Some major spoilers that were floating around the internet are confirmed in TrekWeb 's synopsis , while it also adds lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode writers are hinting that DS9 may still have a future , which can only be considered good news . Even so , Steve Perry is n't altogether enthusiastic about the episode , though it should be remembered that he only read the script , and did *not* see the actual episode . <p> You can find the full synopsis here , though I VERY STRONGLY recommend not reading it - you will probably enjoy the episode a lot less if you already know all the plot points in advance . Meanwhile , a small plot thread dealing with the ethics involved in posting such a synopsis can be found here on the Trek BBS - I myself have n't actually made up my mind about this issue yet . <p> Mania Reviews ' When It Rains ... ' Christian ( 11:55 am CST ) Michelle Erica Green at Mania Magazine has put up her review of this week 's new DS9 episode , ' When It Rains ... ' She is n't that impressed with some parts of the episode , though she really liked Kira 's involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I loved the Cardassians rejecting all her ideas , only to have Garak point out that the Obsidian Order would do the same , then Demar agreeing that they have n't got a better plan themselves . Kira 's tantrum after being goaded about Odo 's conflicted loyalties during the Occupation seemed excessive , since that is something she must have found some way to deal with in order to have fallen in love with him in the first place . Bashir mentioned Odo 's discovery and experimentation upon by the Bajoran scientist Mora , who must have left the young changeling conflicted about any loyalties to Bajor ; it was helpful to remember that , because the Cardassians had a point about Odo 's past compared with Kira 's . I loved the look on her face when she first heard Odo 's diagnosis , and the look on his face when he lied to her after realizing that he already had symptoms . I do n't know if I 'll cry for any individual character on this series no matter what happens , but I will definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK Previews Trek GamesChristian ( 11:55 am CST ) Gamespot UK has put up previews of four upcoming Star Trek games , namely of Microprose 's ' Birth of the Federation ' and Interplay 's ' Klingon Academy ' and ' Starfleet Command . ' Take a look at how the Birth of the Federation preview begins : <p> We had a bit of an argument with the nice PR person who brought Star Trek The Next Generation : Birth Of The Federation ( abbreviated for evermore as BOTF ) into the office for preview . You see she wanted to demonstrate the game by playing as the Ferengi . How humiliating . They may have vast eyebrows and ears the size of a small elephant 's , but they 're a devious , backstabbing , puny race and should rightfully be crushed by a superior one like , say , the Klingons . Oh well , each to their own personally I 'll stick to my trusty betleH , furrow my brow and grow a wispy moustache . <p> The BotF preview also contains the following rather interesting quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game , but rejected because of its character . After all , this is a strategy game and the Borg has only one strategy : encounter and assimilate ad infinitum , forget development and diplomacy . Not exactly the most stimulating way forward . As you meet the other races you get a chance to talk to their representatives , engaging in meaningful discussion about your alliances , who you 're at war with and so on . Again the Borg would have limited this dialogue to ' I am Five of Nine , you will be assimilated ' , with no further elaboration . Having said that I 'm sure we 'd all like to be assimilated by Seven of Nine . Ahem . <p> Meanwhile , you can see for yourself if you 'd like to be assimilated by the game itself by going here , while you might also want to read the Klingon Academy preview or the Starfleet Command preview .

This morning , I noticed two Insurrection commercials during just 30 minutes - the first time they showed the longer version , the second time the shorter version . Does anyone know the reason for this ? Is Insurrection maybe still running in some European countries I do n't know about ? Or is maybe MTV unable to sell all its ad space , and is it now giving away ad space to Paramount ( which is also owned by Viacom ) ?

In it , he mentions that Voyager probably wo n't be returning in the near future : <p> Bryan Fuller : Voyager 's return to Alpha has been the subject of much debate . Much to the chagrin of many staff members , there are no plans to bring Voyager home just yet . <p> Furthermore , he also gives some more info on the recent reshoots for ' Equinox , ' which has apparently be renamed ' The Episode That Would n't Die ' by the cast and crew : <p> Berserker1 : I 've heard that there has been problems concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this true , and how did that get worked out ? <p> Bryan Fuller:Actually , most of our episodes come up several minutes short . We have n't quite pinned down the source of this woe , but it happend more often than not . <p> What usually happens is we 'll get a call from the editors telling us how short the episode is . If it 's just a couple of minutes we add a scene here or there . If it 's like ten minutes short we add a b-story . <p> For example , the framing device of Paris in the Brig for " Thirty Days " was all conceived after the show was shot . It was eight minutes short so Brannon had the idea of creating this framing device with Paris in lock-up . None of that was in the original script . <p> Find more in the full transcript , or , if you 're just interested in the news items he mentioned , take a look at this update from a few hours ago .

Thanks go out to Leonard Schuurmans at Warp Eleven for pointing me to this . <p> " I was actually working on location in Newfoundland the Canadian island province when my manager called me , " says deBoer .

Hans wanted to know if I would be interested in coming in to read for the part of a new character on the series . He had worked on a couple of television shows in Toronto , Beyond Reality and TekWar , that I also had appeared in , so I knew him quite well although we had n't seen each other in a year . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of me , but I do n't stand a chance because I 'm sure they 'll want to get some well known actress for the part .

' Christian ( 1:01 pm CST ) Jim Wright has put up another of his massive Voyager reviews , this time for last week 's ' Someone To Watch Over Me . ' Apparently , he absolutely loved the episode : <p> This is one of the most laugh-out-loud funny episodes of Voyager in quite a while . Its strengths are found chiefly in the performances and the directing . The plot is pure " My Fair Lady , " but the adaptation to Voyager 's sets and characters still works , and some particularly memorable scenes add up to a satisfying , lighthearted hour of entertainment . <p> The focus of this story is on Seven of Nine and the Doctor , with prominent supporting roles by Tom Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven were called on for a little " Sleepless in Sickbay " style romantic comedy . Tom plays the evil John Malkovich role from Dangerous Liaisons ( boo , hiss ) . Neelix and Tomin are pretty much in Broad Comedy ( TM ) mode . ( There were a pair of guest-starring Man Candy that were there chiefly as first-hand testimonial to Seven 's social ineptitude . These scenes were a cross between romantic comedy and low-key slapstick , offering a counterpoint to the Doc/Seven moments . ) <p> I was pleased by all the performances--even the smallest roles had a little more oomph than usual--but I found Picardo and Jeri Ryan particularly effective . We 've seen " romance episodes " on Voyager that worked pretty well , and others that were about as romantically charged as a book on tape of the US Tax Code narrated by Ben ( " Beuller ? Anyone ? " ) Stein . <p> Call it " When Hairless Met Seven . " Or not . <p> In the full review he awards the episode 4 out 4 stars , which certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( plus his massive synopsis ) by going here . <p> From The Wormhole Robert Justman with the story behind the opening narration for the original STAR TREK . <p> Kate Mulgrew An exclusive interview with the captain of the U.S.S.

At their site you will also be able to find info on what issue 3 will be bringing you , such as interviews with Leonard Nimoy en Armin Shimerman . <p> Rumours On Defiant 's FutureChristian ( 12:18 pm CST ) I received some more info from Atavachron today , in which he gave the following very interesting ( possible ) insights about the Defiant 's future : <p> " Since the Defiant has been destroyed on air , it would seem that the Defiant class will indeed be used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back as we knew her , since she was destroyed and the launch plate had been removed from the set ( they all get saved ) . They have always the option to bring her back as the Defiant " A " or with a Defiant class ship with another name . Early on in the series it was noted that the " Defiant " class was not built because of a weakness . But given the popularity of the ship both with her crew and the fans , I 'm sure that the " weakness " in design can be/will be fixed and a series of ships may well get built in the storyline as they see fit , be it the Defiant " A " or whatever . <p> " If you watched the trailers of the last show , there seems to be a Defiant-class ship shown and to note once more : the sets were in very good shape when they were struck as compaired to the sets of ships that have been destroyed on air , including the Enterprise " D " which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle scenes from " First Contact " the sets of the Defiant showed far greater abuse and were refurbished . However in this case the sets could have also been cleaned up before they were struck . And after watching a frame by frame view of the battle sequence , they seemed to be less destructive then they have been on the other " destroyed " ships , including another set on the lot a few weeks ago . <p> " A bit of trivia : the Defiant was known inhouse by some of the crew as a " Borg Buster " and not a " warship " . Several of the production crew were still working with Gene 's view of things , and they prefered to avoid the use of the term " warship " . So the future of the " Defiant " ? Stay tuned , could be Voyager ( been discussed ) , could be a feature length film again . A qualification as always , I do not watch the shows with any regularity because of work or other reasons . I work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting ! If you 'll allow me to do some specualtion , it now seems the Defiant-class starship may actually have a future , besides the remaining Final Chapter episodes . Certainly having the Defiant on Voyager would be great ! <p> More info when I get it , and remember that this source does not do plot info or casting rumours - in case you missed the original announcement a few days ago , the rumour that Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan might want to leave the show did not come from Atavachron , but rather from the excellent Backstage Pass site . <p> Ron Moore Transfer ConfirmedChristian ( 12:12 pm CST ) I 'm ashamed to admit that not only did I forget to mention the Continuum 's Dan Curry chat last Thursday , I also completely forgot about TrekWeb 's chat with Voyager writers Bryan Fuller and Michael Taylor , which took place yesterday . In my defence , TrekWeb apparently forgot to really promote the chat , which was a pity , as it was apparently quite interesting . Even though the TrekWeb people have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kind enough to send me some info on what Bryan Fuller had to say : <p> First , he said that Ron Moore is already at work on Voyager and one of his first projects is a B'Elanna episode . ( Knowing how well Ron does with Klingons , this is great news ) . Rene Echevarria is not on staff . They are working with five writers -- Nick Sagan and Ken Biller are both gone . Neither was fired contrary to rumour . Bryan did say that Joe Menosky and Ron will be Brannon 's right and left hands . Mike and Bryan will be the appendages but he said he would n't specify which : - ) <p> They did the breakdown for the season opener today and it will be a spectacular " event " show . They are talking about doing more two-parters and Voyager movies ( like Dark Frontier ) for next year . <p> Not to crush the hearts of Janeway/Chakotay fans , Bryan made it very clear that theirs was a romance that was never going to happen . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breath to see anything more . He talked specifically about Tuvok and Neelix stories and mentioned that Chakotay was a character in need of rehab--he was falling into the " first officer " syndrome . <p> This certainly sound very interesting - be sure to check out the full transcript when it appears here . Thanks go out to Heather Jarman for sending me this info . <p> New Voyager Episode SpoilersChristian ( 12:08 pm CST ) NOTE - In the below update you 'll find major spoilers for the last two Voyager episodes of this season , ' Warhead ' and ' Equinox .

The bombs orders have been rescinded because it was launched by mistake , but it does n't want to hear that . Then it turns out that a whole fleet of bombs are flying around loose out there as well . Once Harry convinces the bomb that the right thing to do is to stop the invasion , the bomb on Voyager flies out and blows the crap out of all the other bombs who would not listen to reason . <p> Episode 526 , ' Equinox : ' The added scenes may add a bit of dimension to the show , but nothing that will change the story significantly . It is a cliffhanger , with one of the aliens coming right at Janeway in the last shot . Typical alien POV thing where the camera comes rushing at her and then it cuts to black . <p> Thanks go out to Leonard Schuurmans at Warp Eleven for pointing me to this . <p> Final Rating Voyager EpisodesChristian ( 12:06 pm CST ) The Star Trek Universe has put up the final ratings for last week 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch Over Me . ' As expected , ' Juggernaut ' did absolutely disastrous , presumably because no one actually knew the episode would be airing . With a 1.7 rating it ranked no higher than Nr. 112 , was of course sixth in its timeslot behind all the other networks , and did worse than any other Voyager episode . Boo , hiss , Paramount ! <p> Fortunately , ' Someone To Watch Over Me ' did a lot better : <p> " Someone To Watch Over Me " was the second episode , it aired at Wednesday at 9 pm , as normal Voyager episodes do . It got a 3.4 and was nr. 94 , that is a bit low compared to the season average , but still much better than the Monday episode . Voyager was 6th for the hour behind WBs Charmed that got a 3.6 . <p> Voyager was n't UPN 's highest rated show ... a UPN special " WWF Smackdown ! " was , it got a 4.0 and was nr. 89 .

Together they can appreciate Star Trek 's optimistic view of the future , and take comfort in collectively celebrating a universe where logic generally wins out , where friendships matter , where allies protect one another , where the bad guys are always a bit fallible , and where even the most grave situation can miraculously find a happy ending at the 58 minute mark . " During the course of his convention marathon , Shatner also experienced the unexpected : these offbeat celebrations were a lot of fun ! <p> The press release then goes on to mention some of the highlights of the book , and of course also provides us with info on how to buy the book . Find it all here . Thanks go out to Amazon for the above cover image . Not surprisingly , they 're also selling the book . <p> Dan Curry Chat Transcript AvailableChristian ( 12:05 pm CST ) The Continuum has put up the transcript of last Thursday 's chat with Trek Visual Effects Producer Dan Curry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chat itself . Still , that did n't prevent the chat from becoming very interesting , as you can see from the below excerpt : <p> DennisV asks : I 'm a big ST:VOY fan from Holland and I would like to know how the viewscreens on the bridges of the Enterprise-D , E , Defiant , Voyager etc. look like on the set . Are they just black or blue , or are there real images on it ? <p> Dan Curry : The viewscreens on the ship are empty holes in the set . When we are at impulse , outside is a " star curtain , " which is black velvet with little highly reflective chips . These create the illusion of a starfield . When there is a planet , or another ship , or some other special phenomenon outside , there is either a blue or a green screen ( the choice depends on the wardrobe of the actors passing in front of the screen ) the visual effects department then creates what will be seen on the viewscreen and does a composite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual effects image on the screen . <p> When the actors have to look at a specific object on the screen , that is n't there yet we place targets outside , which are bright tape X 's , to keep eye lines correct . Eye lines can also be a problem when there are conversations between people on the viewscreen and people on the bridge . So these have to be planned out very carefully to make sure that everybody is looking in the correct direction . <p> Phil asks : Is using the new Borg look from First Contact on Voyager cheaper than using their old look on TNG ? <p> Dan Curry : The Borg ships are now done as CG models so that would certainly make the cost of doing large numbers of them cheaper , but the Borg design philosophy has remained pretty much the same . For Dark Frontier , when we visited the heart of the Borg civilization I had a vision for the design of the city . I went in to my small woodshop at home and intuitively cut small blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a rough model indicating the design sensibility of how the various structures would relate to one another . I brought this model out to Foundation Imaging and the model makers there used that as a reference to build the huge city that was at least 600 km across . <p> In the rest of the transcript he talks about such things as the bat'leth ( which he designed ) , his own personal background and some memorable Trek episodes . You can find it all by going here . <p> Activision Reports Fiscal 1999 ResultsChristian ( 12:05 pm CST ) Activision , the company that recently obtained the Trek game license , has published its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year which ended March 31 , 1999 . As , obviously , no results from Activision 's Star Trek games are yet available the results may not be that interesting for you , but they do contain a few mentions of the license .

Recently , Last Unicorn ( the RPG publisher ) , brought out two new books for the TNG RPG , and in his column he provides us with some extra info on these books : <p> The First Line : Starfleet Intelligence Handbook ( 96 pages , $15 ) is very much more a " running an espionage campaign in the Star Trek TNG RPG " than it is " running Star Trek TNG espionage episodes . " You get SFI overlays , general organization , and some sketches of rival intelligence organizations from the Andorian Am Tal to the Romulan Tal Shiar . There 's spy tech , spy locations , and spy profiles . All by Steve Long and Rick Dakan , with a little help from their friends . <p> A Fragile Peace : The Neutral Zone Campaign Volume 1 ( 94 pages , $15 ) contains a brief rundown of the Neutral Zone 's history and some of the major worlds therein before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's by a bunch of folks , among them Greg Stolze ( who covered some of the sector material in the core book ) , Rachel Barth , Justin Schmid and Jo Walton . <p> Some more info on the TNG game , and the upcoming TOS RPG he 's currently developing , can be found by going here . <p> Relativity PreviewChristian ( 12:04 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has put up the trailers for next week 's new Voyager episode , ' Relativity . ' As usual , the preview is availabel as a 6 MB movie file , a 480k MP3 file , and as a zipped archive of images , but unfortunately none of those will help you get less confused ( " Two Sevens ?

Still , you can find the preview by going here . <p> Interplay Has Strong E3 LineupChristian ( 12:04 pm CST ) According to a press release from Interplay , current owner of the TOS license , the company will make a very strong showing at next week 's Electronic Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , May 13 -- 15 , 1999 at the Los Angeles Convention Center . E3 is one of the most important computer game trade shows , and Interplay say they 'll be showing all their new PC games , including their three Star Trek titles currently in development ( Starfleet Command , Klingon Academy and New Worlds ) . Take a look at what the press release has to say about Klingon Academy : <p> A prequel to Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country(TM) , Star Trek Klingon Academy(TM) includes a star studded cast with Christopher Plummer as General Chang and David Warner as Chancellor Gorkon . Under the tutelage of Chang , you will learn battle tactics and the code of the Klingon warrior . Complete with 3-D space terrain , a Gunnery Chair and the ability to command capital ships , Klingon Academy has set a new standard in space combat . Prove yourself worthy and you may be recruited to fight with Chang in an even greater , conflict - a conflict that will decide the fate of the Klingon Empire . <p> The full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , including the two other Star Trek titles - check it out here . <p> Happy Birthday Marc Alaimo ! Christian ( 12:03 pm CST ) Today is the birthday of Marc Alaimo , best known for his role as Gul Dukat on Deep Space Nine , though he has also appeared in lots of other television series . Alaimo has two children , who , according to All Alaimo All The Time also celebrate their birthday today . Of course , his character of Gul Dukat will be prominently featured in the last few remaining episodes of Deep Space Nine , but after that the chances of him returning to Star Trek are small indeed . However , should you wish to thank him in an extra special way , you might want to check out the Weekend With Marc Alaimo , which is still accepting reservations . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 12:03 pm CST ) -At 9:00pm , UPN will be showing the all-new Voyager episode ' 11:59 . ' Take a look at what the episode will have to offer you , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon O'Donnel , the first of her family 's long line of explorers and one who helped build the Millennium Gate on Earth . As Janeway relates the story , the episode revisits the town of Portage Creek on New Year 's Eve 1999 , as Shannon O'Donnel ( played by Kate Mulgrew ) nears the deadline to convince the town 's last holdout , local bookstore owner Henry Janeway , to approve the building of massive , half a mile high Milliennium Gate , a model for the first colony on Mars . <p> Personally I 'd say this episode could well be absolutely fantastic - it 's a pity I 'll have to wait another year for it to be shown here in the Netherlands . Thanks go out to Mr. Vidot for the above image , which is of course copyrighted by Paramount . <p> -Today at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the second TOS pilot , ' Where No Man Has Gone Before .

Tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 , Sky One will be airing DS9 's ' Homecoming . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for the BBC info . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 11:55 am CST ) Allow me to make a prediction . NATO just announced it will start bombarding Northern Serbia using planes located in Hungary . That is , the same Nothern Serbia that has a sizable Hungarian minority . Would anyone like to take bets about the next target for Milosevic 's ethnic cleansing ? <p> Again , below you 'll find some spoilers for the DS9 finale - click here to move on to the next update . <p> It appears Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski is looking for someone he can blame for his recent problems ( including ' Crusade ' being cancelled ) , and apparently he selected Paramount as his target . Take a look at the following post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he talks about the DS9 Final Chapter episodes : <p> I have n't seen ' em ... only have heard that the last DS9 ep is pretty much the same as what we did in the Babylon 5 finale . Do n't know that for a fact , but the word on the street is that Sisko goes off with the ancient ones , never to return , and the station gets blowed up . <p> After someone complained to him about not using spoiler warnings , he continued with the following : <p> Sorry , figured it could n't be much of a spoiler since we 'd already done it on our show .... <p> A few days later , Straczynski posted what can only be taken as a direct accusation at Paramount that they stole the DS9 series idea from him : <p> We began trying to sell the B5 series to everyone in town , including Paramount , 5 years prior to getting a Go order . The B5 series was announced in early November of that year . There was NO set ST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got a phone call from someone very closely involved with Trek , who said , " They just decided what the new Trek show is going to be . It 's about a space station that 's a center of commerce , with a travel gate nearby . " <p> Comment from one of the newsgroup posters : " Still JMS must be quite pleased if it is a knock-off , as to copy ones ideas is the greatest form of praise . " <p> Let me steal your car and see if you feel the same way afterward . <p> Certainly this is *very* interesting and also , IMHO , completely ridiculous - DS9 and Babylon 5 are almost nothing alike in terms of story , tone and focus . Quite probably Straczynski is frustrated about his recent ' Crusade ' failure , but does that mean he should start attacking Deep Space Nine ? Thanks go out to Dan Tropea for posting about this to **25;678;TOOLONG . <p> Do you have an opinion on this matter ? If so , why not make it known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trek BBS . <p> CHESS PIECE OF THE WEEK : And possibly of the entire closing arc , Kai Winn . I know some disagree , but I still think that Winn 's acceptance of the Pagh Wraiths happened unnaturally quickly last week , in " Strange Bedfellows . " But this week , we have Winn learning that her new paramour is really the hated Gul Dukat , and within five minutes she is back to planning the Pagh Wraiths ' escape with him . I just do n't think these developments are consistent with Winn 's character , given the elapsed time . Sure , she loves power , but she loves the Prophets , too , and she hates Cardassians . With some more time and build-up devoted to her story ( read : less Vic Fontaine , baseball , and Ezri angst earlier this year ) , this could be really good stuff . As it is , it 's a little difficult to swallow , though interesting nonetheless . <p> John Cook at Sev Trek has uploaded edition 114 of the Sev Trek comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANIMATED Sev Trek ! ! ! Thanks to the talents of Wally Field and Andrew Simpson , we present a 3D animated version of this week 's Sev Trek comic strip . The voices of Quirk and Spook have been supplied by the very talented Wally Fields . The animation was supplied by the equally talented Andrew Simpson who converted my characters into 3d models and animated them in just FIVE DAYS . Both Wally , Andrew and I are very interested in hearing your thoughts on the animation so please email me your comments . <p> I have to say I myself was n't really that impressed with how the movie turned out ( and no , I 'm not just saying that to save bandwidth ; - ) , although the movie does look very interesting indeed . <p> Official Word On ' Relativity'Christian ( 12:41 pm CST ) NOTE : Below you 'll find spoilers for the upcoming Voyager episode ' Relativity .

' The show was taped during Jeri Ryan 's appearance at the Fed Con 7 convention , so four of the screencaps actually show Ryan at the convention . You can find them by going here . <p> 95% of the submissions we turn down simply are n't written in commercial , publishable , readable english . You need more than a word processor with a spell-and-grammar checker to be a writer , something a lot of people seem not to realize ... Most of the other five percent are dumped for ignoring our guidelines . Ca n't tell you how many cover letters I 've started reading that begin " I know this violates your guidelines but ... " and I send it back at that point ( why waste time reading something I ca n't publish ? ) . See this Q&amp;A list for someone who desperately wants to submit his new ship and crew to me , and is n't listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of the ones that come in that are written well enough and fit under the guidelines are bounced because the story , which might well make a fine episode or short-story , is n't big enough to carry an entire novel . Another consistent problem , even from pro writers who have n't worked for us before , is that they ignore the " stay away from continuity hooks " part of the guidelines and wind up duplicating something we already have in process ( I , too , can read the encyclopedia and find some overlooked bit of continuity ; what I 'm looking for is someone who can bring in something NEW that still works under the guidlines ) . <p> A lot of other questions and their answers can now be found at the Q&amp;A Board , including the news that the Greg Cox trilogy ' Assignment : Armageddon ' is now a two-book series . <p> On BBC2 , TNG continued its climb from the flop at the beginning of the month , to an audience of 2.89m , 100,000 above last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Buffy the Vampire Slayer . There was also slightly good news for DS9 - after two weeks out of the top 30 , it finally crawled back in again at joint 29th with Ready Steady Cook , and an audience of 2.3m - almost half a million above the last two weeks ' . <p> Over on Sky One , DS9 soared to fifth place with season finale " Tears of the Prophets " - a ranking almost as high as Thursday evening 's new episodes of ER and Friends . Overall , a much better performance than last week . <p> Shatner Gets A LifeChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) TV Guide Online has a short article up dealing with William Shatner 's new book , ' Get A Life ! ' The article even contains a few quotes from ' Get A Life ! , ' which has Shatner describing the Original Series as only he could : <p> " I 'll be the first to admit that Captain Kirk , at times , came across onscreen as a prime candidate for Prozac , " writes Shatner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then . However , what you 've got to understand is that when you 're an actor standing around in a **29;705;TOOLONG starship , having heated arguments with evil midgets , or giant rubber lizards , or white furry gorilla unicorns , you can never be too sure that your scripted lines wo n't just seem completely ridiculous . <p> " It often seemed to me that without all of Kirk 's emotion and intensity and high-octane hand-wringing , our villains of the week might have seemed more ridiculous than frightening ; the ship 's crisis of the week might have seemed a lot less threatening were Kirk not up in arms . " <p> More can be found in the full article , which also has Shatner selecting his favourite imitator . Thanks go out to the Daily Buzz for pointing me to this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) -Tonight , the Sci-Fi Channel will be broadcasting the first-season TOS episode ' Charlie X ' at 7:00pm and at 11:0pm Eastern Time .

Sluss , Cynic , just put up his new Cynics Corner review for Voyager 's ' Someone To Watch Over Me , ' last week 's new episode . Take a look at one of the problems he had with the episode : <p> RECYCLING OF THE WEEK : Clearly , we 're getting a rehash of DS9 's Kira/Odo plot . The isomorphism is only too obvious : Non-human character ( Odo/Doctor ) falls for a beautiful , if sometimes rude , female character ( Kira/Seven ) who wears absurdly tight spandex . He has n't the guts to tell her , and so he keeps his feelings under wraps . But his secret is discovered by someone who annoys him ( Quark/Paris ) . Too cowardly to act in person , he rehearses on the holodeck . Songs are sung . It does n't taste any better the second time around . <p> More can be found in the full review , in which he awards the episode a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue number 1330 , p. 40 , it says that Peter David was approached about doing a New Frontier comic book . Care to confirm , Padguy ? <p> Peter David : I think that 's something of an overstatement . They dropped me an e-mail asking about my interest in possibly doing a one-shot or a limited series . I asked them if they intended it to be an original story or an adaptation of one of the novels . They never replied . Beginning , middle , end of my communication on it . <p> Being a rather large fan of the New Frontier book series , I sent of a mail to Jeff Mariotte ( Trek comics editor at WildStorm ) , and this is what he had to say : <p> Yes , I heard about this . In fact , I responded to Peter 's email the day I got it , and never heard back from him or got an error message saying that the email had n't been delivered . When I got this , I re-sent that email to Peter and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow him off , and are interested in exploring NF . <p> Apparently this was just a misunderstanding , and hopefully WildStorm will still be able to work something out with David . <p> Trek Fans Internet AlertChristian ( 12:22 pm CST ) The Continuum has posted a letter from Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) , in which he ' expresses his concerns of fraudulent use of names and general misrepresentation by people posing as Star Trek actors . ' Take a look at the text of the letter : <p> Dear Friends ; <p> Recently it has come to my attention that there is someone on line who is impersonating me . I would like to clear up this matter by stating it is in fact , not me . I do not even have an internet account and if you know anyone who thinks it is me , please advise them they should not believe this person . I am sorry if this person has inconvenienced any of you in any way . Thank you . <p> Jonathan Frakes <p> Continuum producer Guy Vardaman then goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gives some tips on how to spot impersonators .

For instance , several weeks ago RenT Auberjonois was posting at the Psi Phi message boards , while Nicole DeBoer also used to be posting here , which was quite interesting . Also , several members of the creative and productive staff have been known to post at Usenet , which is usually also informative . Let 's hope more celebrities decide to join them ... <p> No matter what one thinks of " The Changing Face of Evil " , I do n't think anyone can get away with saying its events were inconsequential . In a single episode , we get to see major religious goings-on on Bajor with Winn and Dukat , huge political goings-on within the Dominion , and a battle with some fairly decisive consequences . You may say that the events in question are moving too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , I would n't ) , but I do n't see any way for people to look upon all of this as meaningless . <p> In the full review he awards the episode a 9 .

Needless to say , I 'm more than excited about it ( and flattered ) , and I 'm looking forward to a long relationship with him . As he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast rumors ' , since he is not interested in this ( he rarely even watches the episodes because of work conflicts or the fact that he does n't like the writing ) . Partly because of this , partly because he respects the creative staff so much , he will on occasion be providing non-plot info , technical stuff and some history , but even that is very interesting . He 's also started posting at the Trek BBS , so you might want to check that out as well ! <p> - It 's been heard that the Voyager crew are talking to some of the writers who previously worked on DS9 . <p> UPDATE 14:10 CET Tuesday : I stand corrected , the below came in from another web site and NOT Atavachron . I apologize for any misleading information . As he restated to me : " I do n't go there " as well as some of the other information I misquoted . I got a ton of Email , I 'm behind in it and I ran some of the information together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan want off the show . Treat this as you would any rumour . <p> -Lastly , It seems that we may well be seeing another Defiant class ship since the Defiant sets were put into storage in good shape . as was noted to me : <p> The sets were taken down without any sign of serious battle damage . For example when the Defiant segments from First Contact were filmed ( The battle with the Borg ) , the sets were refurbished afterwards . The stickers peel up , the carpets take a beating since they 're not made to take what they put the sets through during one of these sequences . The single main example of this is when the Enterprise-D crashed in ' Generations . ' What you saw on screen was what they did to the sets . What little was salvaged from the bridge was later refurbished and sent to a museum in LA . This included the famous ' Arch ' ( which is not the one nice piece of wood that people think it is ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to hear it from Atavachron . <p> Meanwhile , Atavachron is also posting at the Trek BBS - I suggest you check his posts out , they 're really very interesting . Please remember , though , that some of this should still be considered as unconfirmed rumours , as Atavachron himself will also say . Things change constantly with any normal TV production . <p> Starfleet Journal Celebrates AnniversaryChristian ( 3:01 pm CST ) The May issue of the Starfleet Journal , the only ( ? ) monthly Trek magazine exclusively available on the World Wide Web , has just appeared and it 's a very special issue indeed , as they 're celebrating their first anniversary ! Take a look at what this issue has in store for you : <p> Well , we 've reached a milestone , it 's our first birthday ! To celebrate we 're bringing you an extra special report on the Grandslam convention courtesy of the Voyager Virgin , check it out by clicking here . <p> We also have a new columnist , Cerise Robinson , with her Children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Enjoy ! <p> You can find the new issue by going here , thanks go out to the ( still wonderful ) Heather Jarman for pointing me to this . <p> Furthermore , the site is reporting that the " Mirror , Mirror " Sulu and Marlena Exclusives are now available at Kay-Bee Toys , and that the Star Trek fan club now has a stock number available for the 12 " Captain Sisko figure . Find more here . <p> ' Tacking Into The Wind ' TrailersChristian ( 3:00 pm CST ) Star Trek Interactive ! has put up the trailers for ' Tacking Into The Wind , ' one of the upcoming DS9 Final Chapter episodes . As usual , the trailers are available as both MPEG and ASF video clips , but also as MP3 audio clips or as a collection of images . You can find the trailers by going here , and I 'm sure they 'll also be appearing within a few hours at Mr. Video Productions , if you want to wait for trailers with a somewhat higher image quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth itself on occasion on previous Star Trek series ( not to mention DS9 's " Homefront " two-parter ) , but never have we seen Terra take a hit like we do in The Changing Face of Evil . The shot of Starfleet in rubble and the Golden Gate bridge cut in two may be remembered as the Star Trek franchise 's ID4 shot , the equivalent of the exploding White House or Empire State Building from Independence Day . And a single image like that one has more dramatic weight than any talk of casualty reports . It also helps give the Breen credibility as players among Star Trek villains . Up until recently , their mysteriousness had struck me as a kind of inside joke -- like the way we never see Morn speak , although he 's apparently quite voluble off-camera . The main thing we know about the Breen is that we do n't know much about them , although occasionally someone would coin a " saying " like Never turn your back on a Breen . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 2:59 pm CST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might want to do so now , as we 've got a very interesting new member - Atavachron , insider at Paramount ! He 's been posting some fascinating notes telling us about what is *really* going on at Paramount , and I 'm sure you do n't want to miss that ! Take a look at some of the very interesting threads where he has already joined in : <p> -What is the status of the Defiant ? How do the sets currently look ? And also a few hints about what might be the ' next ' ship for Captain Sisko , after the events that took place in ' The Changing Face Of Evil . ' <p> -What are the chances for a new series ? And why wo n't this be based on Captain April / Starfleet Academy ? Find it all here . <p> All the other new sites that were added yesterday can be found by going here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 2:59 pm CST ) Sorry for not mentioning this yesterday , but I was way for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also really in a hurry right now , which is a pity , as I have some very interesting news . Lots more news will be posted here tomorrow - unfortunately I simply did n't have the time today : - ( . <p> Saturday May 1 , 1999 <p> Continuum Reviews Grand SlamChristian ( 1:16 pm CST ) The Continuum has put up a short report dealing with the Grand Slam convention , which took place last weekend in the Pasadena Convention Center . Not many new things are mentioned in the report ( though it does confirm DeForest Kelley 's hospitalization ) , but you still might want to check it out . <p> Featuring a flurry of excitement , " The Changing Face of Evil " is a riveting , carefully crafted balance of all the elements we 've had over the past three weeks and before that . As DS9 plots go , it 's probably the most viscerally engaging edge-of-seat experience this season . <p> There 's a sense that although " Penumbra , " " ' Til Death Do Us Part , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward-progressing shows , they were somehow lacking something necessary to elevate them to greatness--something " The Changing Face of Evil " clearly has . That element , I think , is emotional release . It 's fun to be set up , teetering on the edge of payoff . But at the same time it 's in some ways unsettling and frustrating . The payoff is where the crux of satisfaction lies . <p> " Changing Face " is like the proverbial roller-coaster ride--a skillful tap into a variety of feelings , mainly fear , exhilaration , and anticipation . If " Strange Bedfellows " was the piece that revealed to the audience how characters were committing to new directions , " Changing Face " is the piece where those characters reveal that commitment to other characters . <p> In the end , he awards the episode four out of a possible four stars , as you can read for yourself in the full review . <p> Jeri Ryan Grand Slam PhotosChristian ( 12:42 pm CST ) The Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage just posted 45 images from Jeri Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the pictures , you 'll mostly be able to see Jeri Ryan smiling to the audience or signing autographs , though a few full-cast pictures are also available ( such as the one I reprinted here . ) You can find the images by going here . <p> Trek Books To Be Published OnlineChristian ( 12:41 pm CST ) They are n't yet being published as PADDs , but it is coming close , as Pocket Books editor John Ordover just announced on his Q&amp;A board they will start publishing Star Trek books on the internet . Take a look at the exact quote : <p> Query from : Rick Alright , maybe this is a stupid question , or maybe it 's a question for a different guy .... but with " electronic books " getting some hype recently , has there been any thought put into developing something like this for the ST franchise ? Most fans are more techno-centric than most .... I bet they 'd eat up something cutting edge like web-published novels . And the possibilities of the medium are endless , combining written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the sort of thing that once you develop the delivery mechanism , there 's only limited additional overhead ( no printing , paper , etc. ) for each subsequent release . I think it could work , but then again , I 'm not the one who 'd have to throw in a couple hundred grand to make it happen ! <p> Response from : John Ordover We 're going to try this , on a limited basis , with some of our backlist titles . I 'll let you know when and how when I know . Thing is , as you point out , " Most fans are more techno-centric than most " and that means a far greater chance that some high-level hacker fan will crack whatever security we put in place and start distributing Treknovels for free on the Internet ( just as the script to the Trek movies magicly appear on-line ) . So we 're going to step into this arena cautiously and see what happens . <p> Personally I 'm not sure if this will really be succesfull - reading books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ordover also answered a few other fan questions - you can find them here . <p> You 're either going to love this idea or hate it . Stephen Chao , programming president for USA Networks ( which also owns the Sci-Fi Channel ) has decided to try something a bit different for next season . Instead of doing the standard new show every hour or half-hour , he 's decided to see if people are willing to watch the same program in long , extended blocks . <p> Starting Sept. 27 , every Monday night is The Outer Limits night , where episodes of the show will run from 7-11 PM . Likewise , Tuesday nights will belong to Sliders , also running 7-11 . It 's a smart move , considering that these are two of the Sci-Fi Channel 's strongest programs , and that most of its other programming ( besides Sci-Fi 2.0 ) is pretty much space filler . <p> Unfortunately , what it could also mean is the death stab for Star Trek , which is currently being shown at 7:00pm on the Sci-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be developing several new series , so I have to wonder where this leaves Trek . I 'll report more on this as I get to hear it , but for now you might want to check out the actual article at the Daily Sci-Fi . <p> Q.As for Multiplayer , will there be a co-op mode ? A . In MP you may play single missions in any form of co-op , or team structures you like . As far as playing the SP campaign as a " co-opy " MP , no . Our stories are designed around the single player star and do not lend themselves to coop play like a party based RPG such as Baldurs Gate . <p> Q. As for expansions , is there anything in the works right now . I understand that this might be a hard one seeing is how the demo is n't available ... thought that I would ask : ) A. We would have to refer you to the Magic 8-Ball : It says " Answer Hazy , Ask Again Later . " <p> Paramount has finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 140 cities on May 21 , two days after the Phantom Menace opening . I had in my April 8 column that Paramount had decided on a Trekkies opening that would happen right around the Phantom one . A Paramount spokesperson said at the time that " nothing has been decided . " I guess they wanted to let the news out their own way . <p> The first space-based real-time strategy game set in the Star Trek : The Next Generation universe , Star Trek Armada let 's players command Federation , Romulan , Klingon and Borg fleets as a massive Borg invasion unfolds . Players assume command of up to 30 starships , space stations and repair facilities and play all four fleets in order to complete the single-player campaign . Players must navigate around wormholes , asteroids and nebulae as they engage in the ultimate showdown . Star Trek Armada is being developed and published by Activision . <p> The full preview also contains the first picture ever of the ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' game , and some more info on the upcoming Voyager game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) You can find it all here , and major thanks go out to Wayne T. St.Onge for pointing me to this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) -At 16:00 BST , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' If Wishes Were Horses , ' followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Persistence of Vision . ' Tomorrow they 'll be showing DS9 's ' The Forsaken ' at 16:00 and Voyager 's ' Tatto ' at 17:00 . <p> -Here in the Netherlands , the AVRO will be showing Voyager 's ' The Killing Game , Part Two ' at 18:38 CET . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) Yesterday , the Trek BBS did indeed welcome its 100th registered member , and that after a mere two weeks of operation . Take a look at some of the current topics currently being discussed by those members : <p> -What will happen in the final scene of ' What You Leave Behind , ' the DS9 finale ? And , what do you think about the suggested possibilities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 to 10 years for the next series ?

Remeber , registration is n't even required - just go ahead and post ! <p> New at TrekSeek.comChristian ( 12:39 pm CST ) Yet another 7 sites were added to TrekSeek yesterday , bringing us to a total of 1046 Star Trek links . Take a look at three of those new sites : <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 12:38 pm CST ) Today I was watching the MTV Europe Roxette weekend I mentioned a few days ago . Besides reminding me why I do n't usually watch the station myself ( countless number of mindless advertisements , almost no Roxette songs in what is supposed to be a weekend completely dedicated to them ) , I noticed something very interesting - ' Insurrection ' commercials ! Yes , that 's right , months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paramount is still paying lots of money for Insurrection commercials - I saw two of them during the two hours I was watching ! Why in heaven 's name would Paramount be doing this ? Surely that money could be better spent elsewhere ( for instance , on more DS9 commercials ) ? I guess that company will never cease to amaze me ... <p> Friday April 30 , 1999 <p> New ' Extreme Measures ' SpoilersChristian ( 2:35 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains major spoilers for DS9 's ' Extreme Measures , ' as the somewhat smarter readers may have already deduced from the title . Click here to move on to the next update . <p> KJB , webmaster of Backstage Pass ( ' Your Ticket To Entertainment ' ) , sent me another mail about ' Extreme Measures , ' one of the upcoming Final Chapter episodes . As we already reported earlier , this is the Bashir/O'Brien episode in which they are looking for a cure for the Founder disease . In order to do this , they lure Section 31 director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are as yet unknown . However , now some extra info is available on what the episode will contain : <p> Apparently , in the episode O'Brien and Bashir will have to go inside Sloane 's mind to extract the cure for the Founder disease before Sloane dies . <p> The deadline for entering the 1999 Rules of Netquisition contest is midnight , May 1/2 , CDT ( that 's 5:00am May 2 GMT ) , and voting will begin next Monday , May 3 . <p> More info on the Rules of Netquisition , in which you can come up with your own Rules and win wonderful prizes with them , can be found here . <p> Transwarp Issue 61 AppearsChristian ( 2:10 pm CST ) Seth Dilday has sent out issue 61 of Transwarp , the newsletter which used to be weekly . As always , the newsletter contains info on all the upcoming episodes , it reprints the most important articles that appeared on the net over the past few weeks , and it has the special ' Star Trek Fun ' section . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This week 's poll question : Do you think that Voyager is as developed as The Next Generation was at this point in the series ? <p> Send your responses to **25;736;TOOLONG with " Yes " or " No " in the subject line . The number of responses either way will be posted in the next issue . Last question 's answers : Do you think that Star Trek Deep Space Nine has tied up all of it 's loose ends ? <p> Psi Phi Transcribes TrailersChristian ( 1:53 pm CST ) David Henderson at Psi Phi has put up the transcripts of the promos for ' The Changing Face Of Evil ' and ' When It Rains , ' the two latest DS9 episodes . The transcrips tell you everything that happens in the promos , from the voice-overs to the dramatic special effects , so they 're probably a good choice for you if you have n't yet downloaded the actual trailers . You can find the transcript for ' The Changing Face Of Evil ' promo here , and the transcript for ' When It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian ( 1:06 pm CST ) For the very first time ever , Voyager executive producer Brannon Braga has said that Voyager may actually be coming home next season - maybe as soon as the season opener ! Take a look at part of an interview Eon just posted : <p> " There are no plans to bring Voyager home now , " Braga says . " The season finale will not do that . It 's the first time we 've said that . I do n't think that 's a secret at this point . Maybe in the first episode of next season . " <p> Braga admits though that the last episode of this season : " Does have to do with Earth , and humans . There will be some changes next season , but no casting changes . " <p> Those casting changes might actually still happen , but they would be cast additions , of a very interesting sort : <p> Much like Worf came over from NEXT GENERATION to aid DEEP SPACE NINE midway through its run , now that DS9 is ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters transporting to the VOYAGER world ? " It 's possible , " hints Braga . " We 've talked about it . " <p> This certainly is interesting , and I 'm amazed that Braga would talk so openly about it . More can be found here . <p> Also , if you want to talk about this , a new thread about this has just been created at the Trek BBS - you can find it here . <p> LeVar Burton Writes First FeatureChristian ( 1:06 pm CST ) According to a report from Variety , LeVar Burton ( Geordi LaForge ) is currently co-writing his first feature , ' Masters of the East , ' which he also hopes to direct : <p> He is developing the project with Julia Roberson , his partner in Eagle Nation Films , which has reupped for two years its production deal with Paramount and added a television component to the agreement . <p> It 's based on the journals of a U.S.-born scientist named Baird Spalding who traveled the Far East extensively and wrote six journals chronicling the experiences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It 's the basis for a modern-day action adventure with romance , tied to events that happened at the turn of the century . ' ' <p> Running A Trek CCG TournamentChristian ( 1:05 pm CST ) Decipher , the company behind the Star Trek Customizable Card Game , just put up an article written by experienced CCG tournament director Neil Kirby , in which he gives some hints on how to successfully run a tournament . The article gives hints on what you should do in preparation of the event , how you should run the event and some frequently encountered problems , and if you 're planning to run a CCG tournament soon , you should probably read it . You can find it by going here . <p> " Someone to Watch Over Me " saw Voyager return to form after the disaster that was " Juggernaut , " rising to a 5.5 rating , 8 share . That 's up an enormous 40% from " Juggernaut " and should place this episode in a good position to earn a national rating very close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3.9 . <p> Even better are the ratings for two Deep Space Nine episodes , namely the repeat of ' The Siege of AR-558 ' and the first showing of ' Penumbra , ' the very first Final Chapter episode . Let 's begin with the ratings for ' The Siege : ' <p> " The Siege of AR-558 " rose some over past weeks , ascending to one of the highest rerun ratings this year , earning a 3.8 rating . That places it above all but two reruns from earlier this year and brings a good starting audience into " The Final Chapter . " That rating is up 5% over last week 's " Once More Unto the Breach , " but can not be compared to last year 's episode this week which was a first-run show . <p> DS9 also finished first among the syndicated dramas this week , all of which were in reruns . Xena was close behind with a 3.7 and Hercules trailed in third with a 3.3 . It is of note that this rerun for DS9 equaled the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news gets absolutely fantastic for ' Penumbra : ' <p> The Final Chapter is here , and the ratings to start it all off look good . " Penumbra " earned a 4.4 rating , the highest mark for DS9 since " The Emperor 's New Cloak " and above the season average this year . It was also up 16% from last week 's rerun of " The Siege of AR-558 . " Unfortunately , the episode still failed to hit the year-ago mark of a 4.7 set by " Inquisition . " <p> ... <p> This definately bodes well for the entire " Final Chapter " of DS9 . This series of upcoming episodes should n't see any drop-off . With any luck , things should keep heading up from here . No doubt , the rating was increased a bit by the increased advertising that Paramount pumped into this series of shows -- something they should have been doing all along . In all , this is a very promising start and quite good on its own . <p> Let 's hope the ratings will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look at when deciding if there will be a new series or not . For more , check out the full reports for Someone To Watch Over Me , The Siege of AR-558 and Penumbra . <p> Patrick Stewart An X-Man ? Christian ( 1:04 pm CST ) Eon is reporting that Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) has committed to play the part of Professor Charles Xavier in the upcoming ' X-Men ' movie . The movie , which is helmed by director Bryan Singer , will start filming this Summer , and should be released in the Summer of 2000 . Find more here . <p> John Gregory Betancourt InterviewedChristian ( 1:03 pm CST ) Michelle Erica Green at Mania just put up an all-new interview with John Gregory Betancourt , author of several Star Trek novels . In the interview , he talks about his past work ( both in- and outside of Trek ) , and also talks a little bit about one of his upcoming novels : <p> Recently Betancourt finished the launch book in Pocket Books ' Double Helix series , a six-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a futuristic form of germ warfare , necessitating that the Enterprise " stop the panic and cure the disease . " The second book will be penned by Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch , the third by Diane Carey . <p> The arc of Double Helix - conceived by Pocket Books editor John Ordover and popular series writer Michael Jan Friedman - plays out over six years , with the initial book set between the second and third episodes of The Next Generation . " I had a lot of fun sending Yar and Data on a mission right after their first - ah - tryst from " The Naked Now " and playing games with problems in the early episodes , like Deanna Troi calling Riker ' Bill ' instead of ' Will ' at one point , " Betancourt notes . <p> After that , he goes on to talk about his upcoming ' Hercules ' tie-in novels , and he ends with a few comments about his web site . You can find the full interview by going here . <p> DS9 Wrap Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Eon Magazine just put up a rather lengthy article dealing with the DS9 wrap party . The article features comments by practically every cast member , including a few comments by Armin Shimerman : <p> " It 's very bittersweet , " Shimerman says . " I must say when the Quark head came off for the last time the other night , I yelled ' I 'm free , I 'm free , ' but also there was a little voice in the back of my head , a little Quark voice , that said ' do n't kill me , do n't kill me . ' I 'm very sorry to see him go . He pushed the envelope . I do n't think there 's much more I could do as Quark , except get laid . I do n't think there was much more that could be done . " <p> Jokes aside , between the lines Shimerman may not be as satisfied as he could be . <p> " Not to give anything away , " he adds , " but I was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last finale . What happened there is a secret , but really what happened prior to that is really quite fascinating . What our finale is it 's really not the last two hours , but the last ten episodes , so you have to group them together . " <p> Of course , all the other cast members have their say , and we even get a small hint of what the finale 's final scene will be : <p> " It was hard , " Nana Visitor says . " Oh my god . It was hard . James Darren Vic Fontaine comes up to me , and I 'm off camera , and he 's singing his song doing his close up , and I 'm trying to hang on for him but I just lost it . I 'm weeping . I lost it a couple of times . It 's very emotional . It was hard to realize it was all over . " <p> You can find the full report by going here - it 's really very interesting , though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time you 've finished it . <p> ' Equinox ' A CliffhangerChristian ( 1:01 pm CST ) It 's official now - ' Equinox , ' this season 's final episode for Voyager , will be a cliffhanger , to be continued next season , according to a report at Yahoo : <p> HOLLYWOOD ( Variety ) - John Savage has signed to star in both The Captain on the Starfleet , ' ' a two-part episode of Star Trek : Voyager ' ' on UPN . ... Savage 's Trek ' ' appearances will include the season 's cliff-hanger finale and next season 's opener . <p> Quite probably Variety slightly misunderstood this , as Savage will be starring *as* a Starfleet captain , not in a show with that title . If you want to see the original report , it can be found here . <p> Eon Visits Grand Slam VIIChristian ( 1:00 pm CST ) Albert L. Ortega at Eon Magazine , who seem to be running a Star Trek marathon at the moment , just put up his report of the Grand Slam VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even contains some new info on Brent Spiner 's proposed TNG project : <p> Everyone 's favorite android Data took center stage being as playful as ever . He thanked everyone a countless number of times for allowing him to return once again to the convention circuit . He spoke of his current projects and his proposal to do a non-STAR TREK project with the TNG cast--however it would n't fly over at Paramount . He also hinted that Dr. Okuna was not dead and Dean Devlin would bring him back in the ID4 sequel . <p> The full report contains lots more , including several dozen pictures - check it out here . <p> I have been in contact with several friends who know both De and Carolyn Kelley very well . One of them is a very long time friend of the woman who was the president of De 's Official Fan Club and who still maintains very regular contact with De and Carolyn . She is the primary " source " for this info ..... and considering her close friendship with De and his wife , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital several times to see De and his wife . <p> De is currently in the hospital . He went in three weeks ago for surgery on his colon .... again . If you recall , he suffered from a collapsed colon approximately ten years ago , and he had surgery to correct it at that time . Obviously it has re-occurred . De is in the same hospital as his wife Carolyn and they are currently in rooms right next to each other . <p> Now for the " bad " news . De IS and has been being treated for emphezema and cancer . No doubt caused by his very heavy smoking for over 50 years . He has apparently had the emphezema for several years now ..... the cancer was just diagnosed approximately 8 months ago . Due to these two conditions and their treatments .... coupled with the recent surgery , and his age , De 's weight has dropped to approximately 100 pounds . My source said the hospital wo n't release him because currently he is incapable of taking care of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thought for De , as well as his wife , Carolyn . And remember them both in your prayers if you are so inclined to pray . And let 's also honor their privacy by not drowning them with mail etc. at this time . I 'm sure that they both know just how much the fans wish them well . It 's just that they ca n't handle a huge load of mail at this time . <p> Later on , that source visited him in the hospital , and she said he was in ' extremely bad shape . ' Slight more on this can be found here , and he 'll certainly be in my thoughts - let 's hope he gets well soon . <p> FINAL FRONTIER 's story could have been compelling if not for the serious lapses in direction that Shatner and his writing partners make . After the breakout success of the comedic VOYAGE HOME , the filmmakers here decided that comedy was the way to go . Unfortunately , whereas VOYAGE HOME 's humor was derived largely from the juxtaposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , FINAL FRONTIER looks for its laughs in less honorable places , treating Kirk 's crew like a bunch of incompetents . Chief Engineer Scotty bumps his head on a bulkhead like one of the Three Stooges , Chekov and Sulu ( the navigator and helmsman of the Enterprise ) get lost in the woods , and middle-aged Uhura does some weird dance in the nude . Ugh . <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 12:58 pm CST ) The Trek BBS now has 98 registered members - I wonder who 'll be number 100 . Of course , even with less than hundred members , lots of interesting discussions are still taking place , including : <p> -Did you see ' The Changing Face Of Evil ? ' What did you think about it ? <p> -Which of the rumours about Jeri Ryan and her character , Seven of Nine , are true ? You can talk about that here . <p> And , of course , you can talk about lots of other things at the Trek BBS - remember , no registration is required ! <p> First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding cricket yesterday ( " The Most Boring Game In The World , which , not surprisingly , was invented by the English . " ) To my great regret , I forgot to add a smiley to that sentence , as , of course , my intention never was to insult the English . I do , however , think cricket is *extremely* boring - any game which has matches lasting five full days should be considered boring , in my opinion . Furthermore , all the other sports I consider extremely boring were either invented by the English , or are shown on the BBC *instead* of Voyager , which explains the ' invented by the English ' part . My actual remarks , however , were primarily intended as a good-natured joke at the expense of my ( English ) co-webmaster Saleel Majeed , who is actually a rather large cricket fan ( I 'm ashamed to admit ; - ) , which is something we were talking about just the other day . In short , I hope most of you realized I never intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm truly sorry . <p> Secondly , I 'd like to urge everyone to visit Eon Magazine now - they 're fantastic !

Thanks go out to Psi Phi for pointing me to this . <p> David Henderson at Psi Phi has put up the official Paramount press release for next week 's Voyager episode , ' 11:59 . ' As usual , this also includes a short synopsis of the episode : <p> Captain Janeway reminisces about her ancestor Shannon O'Donnel , the first of her family 's long line of explorers and one who helped build the Millennium Gate on Earth . As Janeway relates the story , the episode revisits the town of Portage Creek on New Year 's Eve 1999 , as Shannon O'Donnel ( played by Kate Mulgrew ) nears the deadline to convince the town 's last holdout , local bookstore owner Henry Janeway , to approve the building of massive , half a mile high Milliennium Gate , a model for the first colony on Mars . <p> I must say I 'm really excited about ' 11:59 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait two years before the episode makes its way to Europe : - ( . The full press release also contains a full list of the guest stars and the creative staff ( including the interesting info that Trek casting director Ron Surma will be directing ) . You can find it by going here . <p> A lot of people saw Seven Days Wednesday night and were surprised when they did n't see Scarlett . Let me offer a word of explaination . Due the subject matter of the episode Scarlett worked on , and in light of the recent tragedy in Colorado , the episode was not aired this week . Scarlett and her family fully understand and support the network 's decision to pull the episode . There is a good chance the episode will be aired at a later date , and will certainly keep you all posted . Scarlett and her family offer a sincere apology to everyone who was disappointed not to have seen Scarlett this week and they extend thier thanks for everyone 's continued support . <p> Although sad news for fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there also is some good news available for fans of Trek 's youngest star : <p> Scarlett was just offered a role in Erin Brockovich , starring Julia Roberts . As information about this film becomes available , I will post it here . <p> And , of course , I will post it here as well . More on Scarlett can be found here . <p> The annual Hollywood Charity Horse Show , produced by Mr. Shatner , is dedicated solely to the helping of children . Some of the kids are handicapped physically , some emotionally , all are in need of help and we can bridge the space for them between the outside world and their world . Attending this event allows us to see Bill Shatner in a more personal way , and more importantly we can help the kids . Every penny raised at this event goes to the children 's charities . <p> More info on this can be found at the official web site of the event , which is also maintained by the William Shatner Connection . The site contains a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reasons behind it . <p> Robert Picardo 's subtle , warm performance made it easy to feel for the Doctor , and Jeri Ryan gave an absolutely terrific performance of the awkwardness and unhappiness of early dating . I also loved hearing them sing again . This show demanded good comic timing - at the beginning , for instance , when Seven suggested that dating leads to procreation and the Doctor said " One thing at a time , " then moments later he suggested that dating leads to marriage and she tossed his words back at him - both actors were admirably up to the task . I did have a few moments of unintentional howling laughter , like when Seven said she was feeling tense from her chronographic sequencer - does it never occur to her that her 4 " heels might have something to do with it ? <p> Robert Duncan McNeill directed this episode ; I did not particularly like Paris herein , either condescending to Torres about her probable lack of driving skills nor lecturing the Doctor on love , but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make note of Ethan Phillips playing the straight man to Tobin 's wildness - lovely stuff .

The Kati would never have left . <p> The overnight rating is in , and Voyager did MUCH better than monday ..... it improved to a 5.5/8 . Voyager was 6th for the hour behind WBs Charmed that only got 0.1 more ! A final rating would be around 3.5 - 3.9 , so we are back to Voyagers normal rating ! <p> Stage 18 is almost clear except for the " hell " planet set . Stage 4 and 17 are being taken apart , however contrary to what was said elsewhere last week , many parts of the Ops and Promenade are going to be saved . <p> I have to tell you it 's really a sad day . However SOME of the sets -if not a large part of them - are going to be saved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report then continues with a ' fact sheet ' detailing the different stages of deconstruction all the sets are in ( Infirmary and Odo 's office gone from the Promenade , together with all the Okudagrams , etc. ) , but also contains info from both the new insider and Glen himself on DS9 's future : <p> More discussion on another series - some people do n't feel that Berman will be able to hold out two years with only VOYAGER on the air ... <p> ( ( Glen Note : I have heard some separate indication that Berman may not be able to take-on another series right now due to several issues , not the least of which is ... simply ... being tired as hell . This might result in the franchise being handed over to someone else , with Berman assuming a less hands-on , more " detached , supervisory " capacity . NOT FOR CERTAIN , so do n't take this to the bank ... ) ) <p> I certainly hope this wo n't turn out to be true , as we could probably kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stays on . More on this can be read in the full report . <p> Gen13 : Netherwar , my first novel , written with my good friend Chris Golden is on sale now , or thereabouts . Copies arrived in my store today , and hopefully are arriving in a store in your neighborhood right now . <p> It 's cheap . It 's fun . Mysterious Galaxy 's newsletter , The Plot Thickens , called it " a kick-ass horror novel disguised as a superhero book , " or something like that . And yeah , I 'm married to the reviewer , so take it with a grain of salt . But that 's what we were trying for , and I 'd like to think we came close . <p> You do n't have to know who Gen13 are to enjoy the book ... but if you do know who they are , you 'll be one up on your neighbors when the Gen13 movies are released by Disney . <p> After a bit of searching , I found the below description of the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnout . Freefall . <p> Five teenagers brought together by the covert ops organization I/O to be the next generation of super-powered operatives : Gen13 . Unwilling to be I/O 's pawns , Gen13 escaped their clutches with the help of renegade I/O agent John Lynch . Now they must stop their creators from gaining access to the demonic power of the Hellgate--and possibly from destroying the world as well ! <p> Although , obviously , the novel itself is n't Trek-related , you might want to learn about Jeff Mariotte 's writing style if you 're interested in the Star Trek comics line . The book should be available at every good bookstore , though it can also be purchased online by visiting this Amazon page ( which is where I also found the cover image . ) If you 're not sure yet you want to buy the whole novel , a short excerpt can be found here . <p> Also , do n't forget that in May we 'll be launching a Q&amp;A forum here at TrekToday where you will be able to ask questions to Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still find the short interview we had with Jeff Mariotte by going here . <p> Michelle Erica Green at Mania has put up her review of the latest DS9 episode , ' The Changing Face Of Evil , ' which she liked rather a lot : <p> I was n't expecting to like this episode because the preview showed lots of battle footage . Actually , I think the preview showed every second of battle footage that appeared in the episode . It was short , it was ugly , and that made it much more exciting than a long drawn-out special-effects-fest would have been ; one shot and the Defiant is GONE ! Not a dramatic death like the various Enterprises have suffered or even Voyager in repeated alternate-timeline explosions , just a matter-of-fact crisis and the crew survives only by the grace of the Founder 's decision to let them go home and stew in their fear . That sounded like a pretty silly decision when she made it - nothing 's as scary as a total fatality report - but she could n't have known what Demar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardassians already knew . <p> Find more in the full review , which also includes a detailed synopsis of the episode . <p> Star Trek Stars Play CricketChristian ( 10:56 am CST ) Proving that the world is indeed coming to an end , AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz is reporting that several Star Trek stars ( including Patrick Stewart Jean-Luc Picard and Colm Meaney Miles O'Brien ) will be participating in a charity celebrity cricket match : <p> Several Star Trek stars will participate along with other prominent British entertainers in a charity celebrity cricket match . The Lord 's Taverners will play the Los Angeles Social Cricket Alliance ; the celebrity team will include Patrick Stewart and Colm Meaney as well as lyricist Tim Rice and Eric Idle of Monty Python 's Flying Circus . The event will take place at Woodley Cricket Field in Van Nuys .

Not surprisingly , it was invented by the English . <p> This report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very , very badly . The episode , due almost entirely to its underpromoted special timeslot , crashed to Voyager 's worst in-season rating ever ( including reruns ) to a 1.7 rating , 3 share . That 's down from everything this year including last week 's rerun of " Timeless . " It 's also down from last year 's episode that aired this week . <p> Not surprising anyone , Voyager finished 6th in its timeslot . The WB 's " Rescue 77 " was the closest to Voyager 's abysmal mark . In addition , the episode failed to even finish as the #1 UPN show that night , falling below " Dilbert " ' s 2.0/3 rating . <p> Hopefully this 'll inspire Paramount to never ever move Voyager to a Monday again - many people I spoke with ( including the webmaster of a rather large Star Trek site ) did n't even *know* UPN would be airing two Voyager episodes this week , and if even the die-hard Trekkers did n't know that , how could the rest of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do that well , either : <p> " Timeless " did n't do quite as well as expected given its overnight , but still crusied to a 2.6 rating , ranking 99th . That 's flat from the last two weeks of reruns and on the season average for reruns . This week last year , a firstrun episode was airing , so no comparisons can be drawn there . <p> ... <p> This is a fairly disappointing mark for Voyager , but only because " Timeless " was a more successful episode in its first showing . On the whole , it was an average performance . Because this was probably one of the easiest ways to inform people of " Juggernaut " ' s special time , " Juggernaut " ' s utter failure can be pinned on this lower rating to at least a limited extent . <p> Happy Birthday Kate Mulgrew !

May sweeps begin thursday ) <p> The UPN Thursday Night Movie : Dying to Live that starred TNGs Jonathan Frakes got a 1.5 and was nr. 116 . That is normal for a UPN movie , but low when you think that Jonathan Frakes starred in it . <p> What 's the bottom line on " Strange Bedfellows " ? Oh , I do n't know .

In fact all of the major crew will be alive in the final frame , including Sisko - seems Avery Brooks found the idea of Sisko dying and becoming a ' prophet ' offensive to the African-American community and so the writers have changed the character 's fate at Brooks ' request . Various supporting characters will be killed , though its not known which ones . Whereas ' The Next Generation ' ended with Picard and the crew playing poker , DS9 will end with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting . Many of the writers and staff of the show will be in the final shot as the other audience members in the program . <p> I have to say I find this very disappointing . Sisko joining the Prophets would have been an extremely powerful ending , and I find it hard to see why Brooks found this offensive to the African-American community - surely becoming a half-God can hardly be considered offensive ? Secondly , this ending sounds extremely anti-climactic - surely they could have come up with something better than Vic Fontaine ? <p> In any case , more on this can be found by going here , which is also where you 'll find some info on the upcoming episode " When It Rains ...

Which means , in theory , it is conceivable the series finale may have begun begun filming today without ... well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely possible that one of several things has happened here : the ending exists but is being held back for some sort of retooling ; the ending was ... simply ... still being constructed at the time my source sent me the information ; the ending of the script was n't finished as of early weekend , and had been hammered out over Friday , Saturday , and Sunday and is now ready to go ; the ending just ai n't done yet no matter how you look at it . <p> However , according to TrekWeb the shooting script is now completely finished , with just a few minor details still being worked on .

Take a look at the official Paramount description of the episode : <p> In the midst of a clash with the Hazari bounty hunters , Janeway is offered assistance from a " think tank , " a small yet exotic alien ship containing disparate life forms , each able to communicate telepathically . Their spokesperson , Kurros , offers to help solve the dilemma with the Hazari , only in exchange for Seven of Nine as payment . When Seven declines their " offer , " the think tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode will have better ratings than last week 's disastrous ' The Fight , ' though I doubt that 'll be a problem , now Jason Alexander is guest-starring . Thanks go out to Mr. Video Productions for the above picture , which is , of course , copyrighted by Paramount . <p> -Tonight , the Sci-Fi Channel is airing the third-season episode ' For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky , ' remarkable for title alone . The episode airs at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time , still in a cut-down version ( Boo ! Hiss ! ) <p> -In the UK , Sky One is showing Voyager 's ' Coda ' at 17:00 CET and at 23:30 CET . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 9:39 am CST ) After five new site submissions yesterday , TrekSeek has just one more site to go before reaching the 900 links barrier . Look for a little celebration tomorrow , but for now , let 's just check out some of those new sites : <p> We in the Voyager Art Department have not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue about what happens after Voyager closes down , rumors of a new series notwithstanding . I do n't even know what we 're doing in season six or whether we get the ship home early or if we go the full seven seasons . Do we slide into a new series as we did from TNG to Voyager ? Beats me , but if we 're asked to stick around , we 're ready to assist . <p> What he 's basically saying is that he knows nothing about a new series besides the standard rumours , but I thought it was interesting to include anyways . <p> Leonard Nimoy hosts Y2K Family Survival Guide , a 48-minute program that , depending on your particular point of view , either provides a solid grounding in how to prepare for mass-computer failure or hypes the panic and incites fear about something that may not transpire . This slickly produced video includes interviews with government and computer-industry figures to gain an understanding of how the problem originated and what is being done to rectify the situation . <p> With an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently loved by all who 've seen it . The news report at the Continuum has more about the video and Nimoy 's involvement with it . <p> Andorian Ambassador Shras , Captain Kathryn Janeway , Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge from " Insurrection , and Mr. Spock have been spotted at numerous Wal-Marts over the past few days at a retail price of $24.97 <p> This year should see the arrival of many more 12 " figures , news on that will of course be posted here as soon as it becomes available .

Deep Space Nine , which was the Next Generation 's underrated cousin , finally ends after seven seasons on May 29th , and in tying off seven years worth of storylines ( they 're not going to the movies , after all ) , a lot of things are going to happen , and happen in ways you might not like . <p> The full preview has more , though none of it is really new if you 've been following the news over the past few weeks . <p> Continuum Chat Transcripts UpChristian ( 11:24 am CST ) It 's almost unbelievable , but the folks at the Continuum have finally put up the transcript of last Thursday 's chat with DS9 Supervising Producer Steve Oster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Emma asks : Hi Steve , I 've heard rumours that Odo is going to meet his maker by the end of the season ( I hope not ) , do you have any light to she 'd on the subject ? , thanks : - ) <p> Steve Oster : Odo has always been drawn to explore where he came from . And certainly that has been a continuing motivation for his character and I would expect that he would continue on that exploration through the end of the season . To clarify I am not part of the writing staff but take whatever the writing staff has written and oversee getting it from the page to what you see on television . <p> NFLD Canada asks : Are there plans to begin a new series to replace DS9 ? If so how about a little insight . Thanks <p> Steve Oster : At this time there are not firm plans for another series though certainly there 's a lot of talk about it . <p> Michael303 asks : What are the current plans to do with the sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie or miniseries ? <p> Steve Oster : Some of them will go on display in museums and the traveling Star Trek exhibits . Others are being inherited by Voyager . Some will be stored for potential use on upcoming features . <p> Lots and lots more can be found in the full transcript , in which we also hear that the final episode will take no less than 4 weeks to shoot ! It should turn out to be an absolutely wonderful episode , then . <p> Meanwhile , the Continuum *still* has n't published the transcript of their chat with Gary Hutzel , which took place several weeks ago . I wonder what he said at that chat that can not be revealed to the public yet ... <p> San Jose , Calif . ( AP ) - Eight years ago , Anthony Wood decided that he did n't want to miss another second of Star Trek , so he set to work designing a digital VCR that could search for programs and record them on a computer disk . This week the first personal video recorder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers get on-demand programming from a black box that sits on their television set and collects shows based on their individual taste . <p> Up to now , we 've all been slaves to television schedules , but with personal television , viewers are now in control , ' ' said Wood , the Star Trek junkie who is now CEO of Replay Networks Inc. , one of two companies offering the systems .

Thanks go out to C G Spender at the Sci-Fi Channel Forums for reporting this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 9:49 am CST ) -Tonight , the Sci-Fi Channel is showing the TOS third-season episode ' Day of the Dove ' at 7:00pm and 11:00pm Eastern Time . Also , they 've now modified their web site , removing the ' Special Edition ' tag and the Leonard Nimoy blurb - all that 's left is a statement ' See all 80 episodes of the original Star Trek series in their Digitally Remastered Format !

Christian ( 9:36 am CST ) This morning , several people sent me feedback on some of yesterday 's headlines . First up , Robert Spottiswood reacted to yesterday 's ' Hello World ! ' , informing me that Virgin 's ' Galactic Airways ' plan might actually NOT be an April fools gag : <p> If this is the plan I am thinking of , it involves a hypersonic ( Mach 5+ ) aircraft cruising at the limits of the atmosphere . And if you think that 's ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into space tourism are aiming for quick and easy Moon visits . Apparently , rich people will pay good money to experience space , so space tourism is worth investing in . That , and the commercial benefits from exploitation of the Moon 's resources and the benefits of weightlessness in production of high-purity materials . <p> John Ordover 's Q&amp;A has been wiped . I *suspect* that 's because either ( A ) he got the script , rendering the speculation moot , or ( B ) the decision came down to cancel the book ... but I do n't know that for sure . <p> I certainly hope Ordover got the script - I 'm really looking forward to that novelization . Lastly , several people ( including Robert and David ) commented on the ' Final Chapter Trailers ' update , noting that the picture of DS9 exploding came from the third-season episode ' Visionary . ' Thanks to all who mailed me for clearing this up . <p> Meanwhile , in case you have absolutely no idea what I 'm talking about , you might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ... <p> Monday March 29 , 1999 <p> British TeleText HeadlinesChristian ( 12:27 pm CST ) Thanks to Saleel Majeed , here are this week 's headlines from the Star Trek teletext page of British stations Sky and Channel 5 : <p> Keep in mind that these headlines are either fabricated or blown completely out of proportion - their main goal is to have viewers call an expensive pay phone number . <p> More ' The Fight ' Reviews AvailableChristian ( 12:11 pm CST ) Two new reviews of Voyager 's ' The Fight ' were just made available on the internet , namely David E. Sluss ' Cynics Corner Review and Jim Wright 's Delta Blues review . For once , Jim Wright did n't have much to say about the episode : <p> Like I said , I do n't have much to comment on . It was an enjoyable episode , rich in mood and in character portrayal . Call it ( * * 1/2 ) . <p> Out of a possible 5 stars , this certainly is n't to be called extremely bad . David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 , but that was out of a possible 10 , making it one of the most ' cynical ' reviews ever . If you want to see it all for yourself , the Cynics Corner review can be found here , while the Delta Blues review can be found here . <p> Final Chapter TrailersChristian ( 11:43 am CST ) NOTE : This update contains ( minor ) spoilers for DS9 's finale . To avoid them , click here , you will then be transported to the next article . <p> Star Trek Interactive ! has put up two new trailers of DS9 's Final Chapter . One of these trailers ( which can be found by going here gives us a first look at ' Penumbra , ' the first episode of the Final Chapter . <p> The other trailer has a preview of Phase 2 of the Final chapter ( the last 5 episodes ) , and STI has a short description of this trailer : <p> Paramount has also released a first look in the Phase 2 of the Final Chapter with five short videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bashir . Star Trek Interactive has the videos online for you viewing , they are located in the new Final Chapter page-check this page often as everything that I can find on the that last episodes will be archived on that page . The character videos deal with each cast members roll in the final outcome of DS9 , they are as follows <p> -Bashir - For seven years one doctor has saved countless lives , Now saving one more will seal the fate of millions ! -Kira - For seven years she fought in the name of peace , now her greatest battle is in the name of love . -Odo - For seven years a shape-shifter has sought his destiny now his fate will colloid with the fate of the galaxy . -Sisko - How will a page from one mans past close the book on a seven year legacy - " Your greatest trial is about to begin " . -History - Seven Years ago history was made , a legend was born ! Now it 's time to make history one last time <p> Rather interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seems to show a runabout leaving an exploding station ! Even though this has already been rumoured to happen , I doubt Paramount would give this away in a preview trailer . Star Trek Interactive also found a short clip of Odo exloding , but I think this might actually be Mirror Odo . In any case , check out the rest of STI 's speculations on the trailer by going here , or just see the actual Phase 2 trailer itself by going here . <p> Latino was filmed in 1984 at the height of the Contra-Sandinista war in Nicaragua . The Sandinista government was defending itself from the invasion of U.S.-backed guerrilla fighters who were trying to topple the legitimate Sandinista government . <p> The Sandinista government allowed us to use their soldiers as extras to play both Sandinistasa and Contras . A troop would film with us for a few weeks and then march off to the front to kill or be killed for real ! Needless to say this made for a highly complex , emotional experience . After all , I was portraying an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to kill Sandinistas in a war that was really happening just miles away from the movie set ! Pirandello had keen insight ! At the time the harbor had been mined by the U.S. government , and this blockade caused terrible privations in the country . My sympathies were entirely with the Sandinistas . <p> For more on Robert Beltran 's experiences shooting the movie , take a look at the actual self portrait . <p> Final Chapter Novelization Not CertainChristian ( 10:09 am CST ) Pocket Books editor John Ordover just updated his Q&amp;A page with some worrying news - they might not be able to publish a novelization of the DS9 finale in time . In one question , David Henderson asked why Pocket Books had n't received a script of the final episode yet , considering Ron Moore recently mentioned the episode would start shooting today : <p> What Ron meant , of course , is that the finale is -scheduled- to start shooting today . All can I say If things -did- start on schedule , and there is a full script today , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a partial script , with the rest up in the air , I do n't know if we can or not . We 'll certaintly try . All I know is that as of Friday there was nothing they could send us . I 'm already considering alternatives , and doing DOMININON WAR II is certainly one of them. : ) <p> Later on he mentions that the deadline for the novelization 's manuscript is Friday the 5th of April - a date which does not actually exist : - ) . I assume he means Friday the 2nd of April , which would mean writer Diane Carey would have to write astonishingly fast to finish the book in time . In any case , more can be found in the full Q&amp;A update . <p> Happy Birthday Marina SirtisChristian ( 9:58 am CST ) Today is the fourtieth birthday of Marina Sirtis , the Greek / British actress best-known for her role as Deanna Troi . An interesting tidbit is that she originally auditioned for the role of Tasha Yar , while Denise Crosby originally wanted to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , Gene Roddenberry decided it would be better to switch the two around , and that is how Sirtis got the role of Troi .

Starting today , the Original Series ' timeslot has been reduced to just one hour , probably meaning that all Leonard Nimoy 's commentary and some parts of the episodes itself will be lost . <p> -In the UK , Sky One will be showing Voyager 's ' Fair Trade ' at 17:00 GMT , with a rerun at 23:30 .

Unfortunately , when we were re-building our database this resulted in the search program accidentally wiping out 300 links , setting us back to ' just ' 689 Trek links . <p> Fortunately we 've got a back-up available , but it 'll still take a few hours for the problem to be resolved and Trekseek to be back up as usual . <p> UPDATE 20:43 CET - we 're back up to 891 sites again , and everything is working correctly .

' Within 8 years , *you* too could be making a pleasure trip through space for the modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits for businessmen as well - a trip from London to New York would only take 90 minutes ! <p> I wonder how much more such articles we 'll hear about as Thursday ( April 1 ) approaches ... <p> Again , this is a spoiler that could seriously lessen your enjoyment of the episode - click here to avoid it . <p> AURORA , the fan club of Robert O'Reilly ( Gowron ) is reporting the following : <p> Just got word from my spies that Robert 's character , Gowron , is going to be killed off in the 2 episode series final of Deep Space 9 . We hope to have more info for you as we get it . <p> Well , it appears that Kai Winn wo n't be the only one to die during ' What You Leave Behind , ' though both of these rumours could still prove to be untrue . As this comes from Robert O'Reilly 's official fan club , however , this might be somewhat more reliable than the usual rumours . I wonder who 'll be the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> ... explains what it 's like to be two characters in the same series , and how he put Jonathan Frakes out of a job <p> The issue also has a preview of Voyager 's fifth season , which will soon start airing on Sky One . Unfortunately , more on this can only be found by buying the actual magazine , though the Cult Times Homepage has a lovely picture of Seven of Nine and the Borg Queen . <p> Celebrate New Year Aboard The EnterpriseChristian ( 11:22 am CST ) The German Star Trek Index is reporting of a unique way to greet the new millennium - aboard the Enterprise ! A German company is organising a millennium party aboard the ' M.S. Enterprise , ' a touring boat on the Rhine . Included in the event are a look at the fireworks at Cologne , dinner , a ' DJ with music from outer space and party hits ' and an Internet- connection with other Trek clubs . <p> The organizers would have loved to have an Original Cast member aboard , but unfortunately they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Personally I think they could easily have afforded that , considering their own ticket price of DM 499 ( $300 ) per person , but I guess that was n't possible . More can be read in this ( German ) preview . <p> Galileo 7 Convention PreviewChristian ( 11:13 am CST ) The German Star Trek Index has put up a preview of the third Galileo 7 convention , to be held on the 30th and 31st of October . The second Galileo 7 convention was held early this year , but due to its enourmous success they are already organising another one . This time around the convention will have a special goal , though , as DM 22 ( about $12 ) of every ticket will go to UNICEF ! <p> Even if you do n't care for charity , the convention should still be interesting for you , as the organizers have signed up a large number of guests . Amongst the stars that will appear are William Shatner ( Kirk ) , Avery Brooks ( Sisko ) , George Takei ( Sulu ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , LeVar Burton ( LaForge ) and J.G. Hertzler ( Martok ) , while the organizers are hoping to sign up at least two more guests . <p> More information can be found on the Official Galileo 7 site , or , of course , in the actual preview . Both sites are only avaible in German , though , so unless you intend to use Babelfish they probably wo n't be of much use to you . <p> Trekkies ReviewChristian ( 10:56 am CST ) This is actually ( very ) old news , but as I only heard about this today , I thought I 'd still mention it . Circle City has put up a review of the new documentary ' Trekkies , ' starring Denise Crosby . Reviewer Bonnie Britton gave the documentary 3.5 stars out of a possible five : <p> Trekkies goes where no full-length documentary has gone before : Into the often uproariously funny world of Star Trek fans . It 's been 30 years since the first episode of Star Trek beamed into living rooms , turning Capt . Kirk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of the future . <p> Since the original TV series first aired , it has spawned more series , nine movies and millions of dollars worth of merchandise . With more than 30 million people watching some form of Star Trek every week , the movie should have a built-in audience . But if you 've been only an occasional viewer or even a non-viewer , do n't let the Trekkies and Trekkers have all the fun . <p> Trekkies is a hoot , the biggest laugh generator since There 's Something About Mary . Not because the filmmakers set out to mock and ridicule these dedicated fans . The opposite is true . They went for balance , letting the film 's subjects tell their own stories , in their own words , without the filmmakers intruding with snide comments or cutting judgments . <p> For a more detailed description of the film , check out the full review . <p> This month , it was " The Disease " which played spoiler . Airing against the Grammy Awards , the show was hit very hard and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , however , that despite its low standing , the episode in November that aired in a very similar position , " Infinite Regress , " finished with a slightly lower rating than this show . That shows some growth in strength for the series -- even the worst-rated episodes are doing better than they did previously . <p> In the timeslot competition , things have been fairly stable . Voyager and " Charmed " commonly fight for the 5th place spot in households and lag far below CBS ' and NBC 's reworked schedules . In key demographics , the show is doing much better , finishing 5th or higher every week in every male segment . " Dark Frontier " brought the demographic numbers for February even higher , finishing 3rd and 4th in key adult male breakdowns . <p> Some other good news is that February 's average rating was marginally higher than November 's , showing in-season growth for one of the first times ever . Of course , the full report has even more , including a breakdown per episode and a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up soon , we 'll be informing you about that when that happens . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 9:38 am CST ) Yesterday TrekSeek reached 890 sites - just a few days to go before we get to 900 !

Today is the last day of shooting on the final episode that I had a hand in writing , which is named " The Dogs of War " for now . Rene and I co-wrote the teleplay on this one and it is with a heavy heart that I watch the last few dailies of scenes that I helped to craft . <p> In the full update , Ron Moore talks about the final episodes , his son , Voyager and Majel Barret Roddenberry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also mentions that the DS9 sets will ' torn down and thrown into the trash ' after the series ends , so I guess that means we wo n't be seeing any DS9 movies soon : - ( .

After his sloppy death in " Generations " ( when our hero was smashed on the side of a cliff ) , many fans were angered and it widened the chasm between TOS fans and the newer Trek fans . This is a situation that needs to be rectified ! <p> We are asking Paramount to bring Captain James T. Kirk back into a Star Trek movie .

Marc is not hanging up his career , by any means , but with DS9 no longer calling him in at a moment 's notice , the likelihood of him being tied up is lessened , and we can plan this event with a high degree of confidence in his ability to be in attendance . Besides which , we 're sneakily holding it in a location just a few miles away from where he lives , so he ca n't get lost on the way , or plead it 's too far to come . <p> Information on the event ( including a sign-up form ) can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pointing me to this . <p> In 1999 , Target , Wal-Mart , and Toys-R-Us stores become a destination for Playmates ' popular line of Star Trek toys .

Bobby O'Reilly ( Gowron ) and I recently did a convention in Germany , for example , and we had a fabulous time . None of it would have been possible if Gene Roddenberry had not put fingers to keyboard years ago . I owe a profound debt to that writer and the others who have helped develop the Star Trek universe . I hope these writers and producers go on to do something else in the science fiction vein and I hope they come and get me ! " <p> Take a look at the full article for more of Hertzler 's thoughts on DS9 , his acting techniques and how he got hired in the first place ! <p> Star Trek : New Worlds , currently in development by UK coders Binary Asylum for PC , looks likely to be released on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game featuring The Federation , Klingons and Romulans fighting each other for possession of planets in a Command and Conquer-style set-up . <p> The rest of the news item goes on to have several Interplay people , erm , *not* commenting on a Dreamcast move , so I 've got no idea where the people at Future Gamer got their info from . They also mention that any possible Dreamcast version would n't appear before the year 2000 anyways , and considering Interplay 's license ends this year , I 'd say the chances of a Dreamcast version are n't very good . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 11:45 am CST ) -In the UK , Sky One showed DS9 's ' Accession ' at 4:00pm GMT and Voyager 's ' Warlord ' at 5:00pm GMT . Tomorrow at 4:00pm , they 'll be showing DS9 's ' Rules of Engagement , ' followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' The Q and the Grey . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , and my apologies go out to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Christian ( 11:36 am CST ) I just completed my annual Windows ' 95 re-install . This time I was forced to do so after SimCity 3000 refused to run , and I absolutely *had* to play that game - I spent months on SimCity 2000 . Fortunately I 've got Windows itself up now , but I still ca n't receive e-mail - if you sent me mail , I 'll try to get back to you as soon as possible . <p> UPDATE 20:17 CET : It seems I was lucky - just today word got out of a new and very malicious computer virus that 's spreading through the Internet . It has already led to Microsoft suspending all incoming and outgoing e-mail , so it 's very serious indeed . Check out this article for more on the virus . Thanks go out to Treknews'Jason Ellis for warning me about this . <p> Friday March 26 , 1999 <p> DS9 Final Chapter SpoilersChristian ( 2:22 pm CST ) NOTE : This update contains spoilers for DS9 's final episodes - they could seriously undermine your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading these spoilers , click here to be transported to the next article . <p> Two posts were made to the Trekweb Bulletin Board today which had some extra info on the final DS9 episodes . First of all Trekweb owner Steve Krutzler posted the following info , quite possibly dealing with ' The Dogs of War : ' <p> The Defiant is going to be destroyed in an episode leading up to the finale . <p> Considering that other sources have reported that DS9 will be destroyed in the finale and Benjamin Sisko will join the Prophets , one has to wonder what will actually be left when the series ends . Another post made by Leonard R mentions the following , apparently confirming several of the rumours floating around : <p> Somewhere in the season finale , Worf decides to go back and serve onboard the Enterprise , following a particularly ugly scene between himself , Ezri and Julian ( it is not known what happens , but it should occur in one of the last episodes ) . That is how the Enterprise comes to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enterprise E onto the small screen . It is not known if any other TNG crew member will be in it , but expect the Enterprise to make-up for the movie by blasting her phasers . At a recent convention , Marc Alaimo is proported to have mentioned how he is involved in Kai Winn 's death . <p> Quite possibly the ' ugly scene with Ezri and Julian ' involves the romance between those two , which we reported on a few days ago . In any case , check out the Trekweb Bulletin Board for a discussion on this . <p> As usual , these are all just rumours , and have n't been confirmed . It could very well be that none of this is true , so do n't get your hopes up about the Enterprise yet ... <p> Dateline Issue 102 AppearsChristian ( 1:36 pm CST ) A few days late , Bill Mason has sent out issue 102 of Starfleet : Dateline , one of the longest-running Trek newsletters around : <p> Apologies to everyone for a late issue this month . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach bug that laid us out over the weekend . All are feeling better , including Mom and Baby . : ) On the baby subject , I have tentatively scheduled the next issue ( #103 ) for April 18th . With our due date on April 4th however , I may delay or cancel issue #103 entirely depending on what baby has done . I will endeavor to keep you informed . <p> The new issue contains a round-up of all the important Trek news that happened last month ( including some all-new news ) , an article about the future of Trek and a look at the most popular books in the Dateline bookstore . The full issue can be read by going here . <p> Why Pickhard hates kids . He 's defeated the Bored , Klingoffs , Wrongulans and all manner of omnipotent beings . However , Pickhard still seems most uncomfortable around children . Still , it 's understandable if his only experience is Measly Cruncher ! <p> Playmates Customer Service has confirmed that Target ordered 10,000 units of each 4.5 " Exclusive . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found as high up as the 13,000s , but Playmates is checking into it and will let us know . Future 4.5 " Exclusives should be available in the same quantities . The production run on the Target 9 " Exclusives is 7,500 units of each figure . <p> The Maniac also has news on the ' The Tholian Web ' twin pack ( the contents of which has changed ) and the 9 " Kay-Bee exclusives - for news on that , take a look at the full update . <p> The Great Link MovesChristian ( 1:01 pm CST ) As of today , Trek news site the Great Link has moved to its new location at http : //www.greatlink.org . The move was necessary because of the imminent closure of the STZone , the legendary collection of Trek sites . Fortunately , the Founders have now settled in at their new location : <p> Hi , and welcome to the new home of the Founders . Solids with 4th Generation browsers will notice some font changes , due to TGL now using Cascading style sheets . Users of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ font change ( the site now uses Arial instead of Helvetica ) . <p> When her " Star Trek " run ended , she was open to all sorts of work , Farrell said , but she wanted to pursue a sitcom because " everybody talks about it being the cush life . " So far , the talk has held true , she said . " And when it ended up being with Ted , " she said , about landing on a sitcom built around the " Cheers " star , " it was like the icing on the cake . " <p> First of all , it appears UPN is still hacking away at their Voyager episodes - even the new ones : <p> They are still &amp;%*&amp; at it . The Fight has about two minutes cut from the episode . Because it is a new episode , I do not know where the cuts are . I can only provide the length of each segment . <p> This certainly is worrying - is UPN really doing so bad they even need to cut down first-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how long each Act lasted , and to read about their previous two hack jobs . Meanwhile , if you 'd like to know what episodes they 'll be hacking next , take a look at Vidiot 's updated Voyager air schedule , which itself also has a few surprises . <p> Lastly , and most importantly , Vidiot has a second preview up of next week 's Voyager episode , ' Think Tank , ' the episode guest-starring Seinfield 's Jason Alexander . Possibly to coincide with this , the Continuum has published the official ' Think Tank ' press release : <p> In the midst of a clash with the Hazari bounty hunters , Janeway is offered assistance from a " think tank , " a small yet exotic alien ship containing disparate life forms , each able to communicate telepathically . Their spokesperson , Kurros , offers to help solve the dilemma with the Hazari , only in exchange for Seven of Nine as payment . When Seven declines their " offer , " the think tank focuses on taking her by force . <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , while Vidiot 's new preview ( including zipped images , a video clip and an audio clip ) can be found here . <p> This episode , much like the voices in Chakotay 's head , has no focus . Is it about Chakotay 's fear of ending up like his grandfather , who had a similar , repressed gene problem ? Is it about Chakotay 's fear of leadership ? Is it about ... boxing ? Hell if I know , but it sure is sloppily thrown together . The mood is all over the place and the scenes seem to be placed in a random order . ( Aspiring filmmakers , try cutting up the segments of this episode and putting them back together in a totally different order -- voila , five new episodes of Voyager . Like magic ! ) <p> Did I already mention Sarah Kuhn did not like the episode ? The full ( one-star ) review can be found by going here . <p> Furthermore , two of the JLR Homepage 's staff members are now off to tomorrow 's Sci-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session with Jeri Ryan . Expect full coverage of that in a few days , when they get back . <p> Mad Magazine Does InsurrectionChristian ( 10:56 am CST ) The April 1999 issue of Mad Magazine features a parody of Star Trek IX : Insurrection . Unfortunately , no further details or a preview are yet available , but the magazine can now be found at local newsstands in the US for $40 . Major thanks go out to Evay for reporting this . <p> ' Star Trek - The Magazine ' To Launch SoonChristian ( 10:46 am CST ) The Continuum has announced that ' Star Trek : The Magazine ' will soon be coming . More details will be posted at the Continuum as they become available , but I assume it 'll be something like the British ' Star Trek : Monthly ' magazine . This is also good news for Star Trek itself , incidentally , as I doubt Paramount would be launching a Star Trek magazine if they saw no future for Trek . Of course , I 'll be reporting more on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nimoy ! Christian ( 10:19 am CST ) Today is the 68th birthday of Leonard Nimoy , who probably needs no introduction . For 33 years now he has been known as Mr. Spock , the half-Vulcan / half-Human serving under Captain James T. Kirk . However , Leonard Nimoy also played an important role behind the scenes of Star Trek , as he directed ' Star Trek III : The Search For Spock ' and ' Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home , ' and he co-wrote the story for ' Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country . ' Currently Leonard Nimoy is producing radio adaptations of science-fiction classics at his Alien Voices company , the production house he co-founded with John DeLancie ( Q ) . <p> We at the Trekzone Network wish him a happy birthday , and we hope that he may truly live long and prosper !

Paul Star Tribune . The paper reports that producer Rick Berman will be ready to launch another Trek series when Voyager ends : <p> Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine on Voyager ) is quoted as saying , " If Rick Berman said Voyager was the last one , I would n't believe him for a million dollars . It 's an absolute cash cow . " ' <p> UPN network exec Tom Nunan is pretty high on the future of the Trek TV franchise telling the paper that the finish of Babylon 5 will only increase the public 's appetite for Trek . " Next season , we could be the only prime-time sci-fi show on the air . I think there will be a renaissance next year . ' ' <p> Especially this last factor could be very important - now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine is ending , people will get hungry for new Trek . Take a look at the full report for more , including a quote from Majel Barret Roddenberry , who does n't seem to believe in a new Trek series . <p> The Doctor To Explode In Warhead ? Christian ( 2:06 pm CST ) NOTE : This post contains spoilers for the upcoming Voyager episode ' Warhead ' ( presumably ) . If you want to avoid reading these spoilers , click here to scroll down to the next news item . <p> Leonard Schuurmans at Warp 11 just received new info on the upcoming ' Warhead ' episode from someone who heard Robert Picardo ( The Doctor ) speak at a NASA conference : <p> Apparently , Voyager encounters two societies in war . When one sends a " smart bomb " in the direction of the other " by accident " it is left to Voyager to stop it before the other society is destroyed . Complicating issues is the bomb , which is " sentient " and feels it can only be satisfied if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can implant the personality of the bomb into the Doctor 's subroutine 's . The Doctor becomes the voice of the bomb . <p> Picardo commented that while the episode was fun , he would rather hold off playing a bomb again , as it tends to lead to lines like " Do this or I will blow up ! " <p> Take a look at the full update for more on this . Do remember , though , that these are just rumours and they have n't been confirmed yet . <p> S.P.O.C.K. To Perform In GermanyChristian ( 2:21 pm CST ) The German Star Trek Index has an article up about Swedish rock group S.P.O.C.K. , which will be performing in the German town of Krefeld on Friday the 9th of April . With the band 's name , and song titles such as ' Dr. McCoy , ' it 's really not too hard to guess what they 'll be singing about . For info on how to see them , read this article at the German Star Trek Index . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight " only managed a downright awful 3.7 overnight rating , 6 share . That is not only the lowest overnight rating of the year for a firstrun , it 's lower than all but one of the rerun overnight ratings , down from last week 's rerun of " In the Flesh . " <p> ... <p> This is , quite simply , terrible . The episode has a very , very good shot at becoming the lowest-rated Voyager episode ever , falling below the 3.1 mark set by " Vis a Vis " last year . There are no circumstances out of the norm that would go towards explaining a performance like this -- the interest level simply must not have been high . Next week should perform much better . Final ratings will be out when I recieve them . <p> Unfortunately , DS9 's ' Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges , ' which aired on the 1st of March , did n't do that well either : <p> " Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges , " while still remaining the #1 syndicated drama , continued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's flat from last week 's " Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang , " and down 25% from last year 's " Change of Heart " ( 5.5 ) . <p> CIC Video plans the release of the German version of Insurrection ( " Der Aufstand " ) on videotape in the middle of July 1999 . They are now releasing all eight movies in a digitally remastered version and for the first time the extended version of ST : The Motion Picture ( ST : " Der Film " ) and ST VI : The Undiscovered Country ( STVI : " Das unentdeckte Land " ) . <p> Blueman Publishing is planning to soon release several CD-ROMs relating to Trek properties . The CDs ( about Insurrection , First Contact , and Voyager ) will join the Generations CD that is already available . The content of the ST9 and Voyager CD-ROMs are unknown , but they may contain the same interviews , behind-the-scenes info , and various bits of multimedia that will be on the FC CD . <p> The update also mentions that Germany is now officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA , so I certainly feel justified in reporting all this German info : - ) . For more on this , plus info on some airlines that are playing Insurrection in-flight , take a look at the full update . <p> Ben Stevens has graciously provided us with more details about the call-in question and answer session with Jeri that will be part of the SciFi Expo this Saturday . Jeri intends to call during a break in the filming of her movie to answer questions over the PA in the Windhaven room . This part of the convention will take place at approximately 2:00 p.m .

' <p> PC Action ' Birth of the Federation ' PreviewChristian ( 1:11 pm CST ) Paul Weaver at FedCom has put up my scans of the PC Action preview of ' Birth of the Federation , ' which I told you about a few days ago . Besides that , FedCom also has a translation of of the PC Action interview with Jeff Holzhauer , the game 's producer and designer : <p> PC Action : What is the team currently still working on and when are you expecting to have the game completely finished ? <p> Jeff Holzhauer : We 're currently dealing with bug fixing , only the AI will probably never be finished . Well , one can always improve on the artificial intelligence algorithms and since all parts of the game are now 99% complete , we can concentrate on optimizing the AI . Also , we are commencing work on the localized versions of BotF . Our official master-date is April 15th and the shipping date depends primarily on our marketing guys . We do n't have specific date but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birth of the Federation will be simultaneously released in the U.S. and in Germany - today ( February 19th ) is incidentally the date for our first German version . <p> The full interview , translated for FedCom by Tobi Bonthrone talks about some of the game 's features and about Jeff Holzhauer 's background - check it out here . <p> STC : When you first signed on to play Rom , did anyone have any idea to the extent he would become involved in the ST:DS9 universe ? <p> Grodenchik : It 's an interesting phrase , " signing on , " but I never thought of it that way . Only the series regulars sign the original six-season contract ; this seventh season was added on much later . You have to know that I came in to read for the role of Quark . That 's how Armin ( Shimerman ) and I met . We talked about the possibilities of playing Quark 's brother . We were each interested in doing that . But once Armin was cast , the first call I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the guy running the Dabo game in Quark 's Bar in the pilot . They did this big master shot , I believe it 's the very first time we ever see Quark 's bar , and needed to make it look like it was the hub of all activity on the station , and populated the place with lots of characters , and I played the Pit Boss . I think it was the very next episode where I was given the name " Rom , " but I was contracted for one episode at a time -- and I still am to this day . <p> In the full interview Grodenchik talks about his future , his experiences with the Internet , and his fan interactions . Thanks go out to Warp 11 for pointing me to this . <p> Mania Looks At Animated TrekChristian ( 10:50 am CST ) Michelle Erica Green has been rather busy today , as she 's also put up a guide to the Animated Series for AnotherUniverse 's Mania Magazine . The guide looks at all the episodes from the Animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going here . <p> The temptation is strong to say , " This episode hit hard through the first five rounds , but KOed itself in the final minutes . " I think , however , that I have had enough boxing metaphors for awhile . I know nothing about boxing , but I recognize cliches from Rocky when I hear them ... moreover , I suspect that no one training an opponent of Mike Tyson really tries to convince the poor man that his real goal is to take as many hits as possible in order to see whether he has the heart of a boxer . I understand that the point of " The Fight " was to hammer home the theme of not letting one 's own fears become debilitating , but I got hit over the head once too often with that message . <p> -In the United Kingdom , Sky One will be showing the third-season Voyager episode ' Future 's End , Part I ' at 5:00pm GMT , with a rerun at 11:30pm GMT .

But since Dukat is disguised as a Bajoran , Kai Winn is in for a big surprise . <p> THE DATERS : My source says TPTB are heading towards a romance between Ezri and Julian . If you know it 's coming , you can see the signs . This is not official as yet , but a path is being cleared . I , personally , suspect that when Ezri and Worf come to terms with each other in " Eclipse " this will allow Julian to move in . <p> Dukat will probably turn into a Bajoran in episode 20 , the fourth episode of the Final Chapter , which is called ' The Changing Face of Evil ' ( hence the name ) . Sid City also gives us an explanation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset with how quickly some titles leaked , so he 's leaking bogus titles .

Christian ( 12:18 pm CST ) As you may know , game publisher Activision recently obtained the Star Trek game license from Paramount , making it the only company able to publish Trek games for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , as this would allow Activision to develop games that would be based on all four series , and not just on one . However , now it appears that Activision might not actually be able to do that , after Raven Games published an interview with several Raven staff members in which they also talk about their upcoming Voyager game : <p> Kenn Hoekstra : Activision acquired the rights to Star Trek and Raven was given the opportunity to make one of the first titles under the license . The Star Trek license is not all encompassing ... There are separate licenses for the Original Series , Next Generation , Voyager and DS9 . The Voyager license was available , we like the show so we decided to make the game . Star Trek could be the largest cultural phenomenon of all time ! I certainly think that there are more than enough fans to support Star Trek games ... especially this one . = ) <p> This certainly sounds like bad news - I would have loved a game based on all four series , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , read the full interview for more , although this was the only quote dealing with the Voyager game . <p> Here are the winners of " The Deciphers Awards " for outstanding achievement in CCG design and performance .

But remember , they 've been chosen by the experts - You ! <p> The awards were presented for expansion sets , cards and conventions , and a listing of all the winners can be found here . <p> In other CCG news , Decipher has just announced a minor change in the Trek CCG rules - find the updated rules here . These new rules will already be used during this year 's CCG World Tournament , which has also undergone some changes . The regional tournaments will now be held in 21 specific regions , while people from countries not in those regions have been put in a special ' Neutral Zone .

Although the basic game functions are the same , the design team has added a lot of flash and control to their combat system and have fleshed out the research tree a good bit as well . <p> The rest of the preview talks about the game 's resources and its research options , and promises a new preview in April which will look at combat . There are also tens of new screenshots , so it 's well worth a look . Thanks go out to BotF news site FedCom for pointing me to this . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 11:18 am CST ) -In the US , UPN is showing the new Voyager episode ' The Fight ' at 9:00pm Eastern / Pacific Time . Take a look at this short blurb from the official press release : <p> While the ship is caught in Chaotic Space , a zone where the laws of physics are in a state of flux , Commander Chakotay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mauler . Before long , he 's going head to head with the Delta Quadrant 's champion , Kid Chaos . <p> This episode is either going to be absolutely great , or the worst thing Voyager ever thought of . Let 's hope they manage to pull it off - the idiotic premise certainly is n't helping them . <p> -Tonight , the Sci-Fi Channel is showing the third-season TOS episode ' Is There In Truth No Beauty ? ' at 7:30pm Eastern Time , with a rerun at 11:30pm . <p> -In the UK , Sky One is showing Voyager 's ' Remember ' at 5:00pm GMT . If you missed it ( possibly because I posted this 20 minutes too late ) , the episode repeats at 11:30pm . Also , at 6:00pm , the BBC is showing TNG 's ' The Next Phase . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> -Sat.1 is also showing Trek today ( no pun intended , honestly ! ) , but as I ca n't connect to their server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trekseek.comChristian ( 11:01 am CST ) TrekSeek is now up to 881 Star Trek sites , after another 5 sites were submitted to our database yesterday . Take a look at some of those new sites : <p> -Star Trek : Hypertext is the official web site for " Jammer 's Reviews " of Star Trek . Currently , this site covers all episodes of Deep Space Nine and Voyager , as well as short reviews for all episodes of The Original Series . -Doc Mojo 's Sickbay allows you to download meshes ( *. max ) , view an art gallery , and enjoy movies . It 's also the first site I 've ever seen that has *two* pop-up ads , not exactly making it a joy to visit ... -Star Trek Costumes teaches you how to make your own Sarfleet uniform . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:54 am CST ) For once I 'm not to blame for the late start - the server TrekToday resides on was down for the past 30 minutes , so I was n't able to update . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting e-mails , though , so I suppose I should actually be grateful for the downtime ... <p> Tuesday March 23 , 1999 <p> RenT Auberjonois Chats At Psi PhiChristian ( 2:52 pm CST ) Something very surprising happened at the Psi Phi - actor RenT Auberjonois ( Odo ) has started posting on their DS9 message board ! His first post was in reaction to an earlier post that talked about a picture of him and his wife . In response , RenT Auberjonois posted the following : <p> Our fearless Webmeister , Carolyn Fulton , mentioned the brouhaha caused by your comments on this discussion board . My immediate reaction was something along the lines of : " Oh ! I 'd love to eavesdrop on people " trashing " me ( and defending me ) ... sort of like Huck and Tom attending their own funeral ! " <p> Well , she warned me ... but I could n't resist . To a certain degree I have to admit you 're correct about " my ego " ... after all -- I 'm an actor . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the tar baby " ; I 've opened the Pandora 's Box ... I 've read every word posted and I ca n't resist the impulse to respond . It 's my first time , so please be bear with me . <p> Naturally , a whole debate followed , with lots of people questioning his identity . Personally I believe this is actually RenT Auberjonois posting , as later on Carolyn R. Fulton , webmaster of the RenT Auberjonois Internet Link posted the following confirmation : <p> I can also verify that " it 's really , truly him " . However , it does n't sound like that will be enough proof for you . All I can say is that he copied me this message verbatim in a private e-mail yesterday , and that if you go to his web page and e-mail the webmaster , I 'll verify it through that address as well . <p> Although there are many more posts to be found at the Psi Phi boards , there is one other which is very interesting , as it appears to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Have you heard the rumours re : DS9 MOW 's Movies of the Week ? Do you know who 's directing this week 's episode ? How does Nana look in her StarFleet uniform ? Who 's the new Nagus ? Who gets to finish off Dukat ? What major character does n't survive ? <p> This is all extremely interesting , and I could go on quoting posts all day , but instead I 'll just direct you to the DS9 forum so you can see for yourself . It certainly is a unique opportunity to actually hear from one of the actors in a highly personal way - my only fear is the forums will soon be filled with people spamming and insulting RenT A , forcing him to leave again . I certainly hope everyone will be polite to him - it 's absolutely wonderful of him to do this ! Thanks go out to Hunter for pointing me to this . <p> Last night , while entering the Academy Awards circus , Patrick Stewart was stopped by Joan Rivers for questions . While making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown into town from London after shooting had wrapped on his Christmas Carol TV film , most likely to be premiere on the USA Network . <p> Insurrection Drops To 47th PlaceChristian ( 12:00 pm CST ) In North America , ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' has fallen to the 47th place in the Daily Variety Box Office Chart for the past weekend . Over the weekend , Insurrection grossed $92,335 , which is 60% less than last week . As the number of screens on which the movie was shown dropped from 411 to 135 , this is n't all too surprising . In all probability , this was the movie 's last week in the top 60 , after having accumulated a total domestic gross of $70,118,044 . <p> Easter Seals To Air In CaliforniaChristian ( 11:53 am CST ) Next weekend , some syndicated stations in Southern California will be airing the two-hour ' Hollywood Salutes Easter Seals ' ceremony . The show airs Sunday , March 28 , from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. , on KCAL Channel 9 in Los Angeles and Orange counties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. on XETV ( Fox ) in San Diego County . Some more info on the Easter Seals : <p> Hollywood Salutes Easter Seals ' ' is not a fundraiser . With no phone banks or check presentations , it aims to increase public awareness of disability issues by giving viewers an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how their favorite television shows incorporate disability themes into their story lines . <p> This year , Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was posthumously honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award , presumably in recognition of the great job Trek did with disabled characters ( Geordi LaForge , for instance ) .

' <p> This was actually a rather difficult issue back when the movie was produced , as producer Harve Bennett and scriptwriter Nicholas Meyer claimed that Meeson/Kirkes were only responsible for a very small part of the script , and Bennett and Meyer deserved the main credit . In the end , after arbitration by the Writer 's Guild , all 4 writers were credited for the movie . ( Source : Edward Gross ' ' The Making of the Trek Films ' ) <p> I 'm sure , though , that this time around there were n't any concerns , and ' Anna ' will turn out to be an absolutely great movie . For more , check out this press release . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:42 am CST ) Incredibly for a Monday , we received no less than 7 site submissions at TrekSeek yesterday , bringing us to a total of 873 Star Trek sites .

Christian ( 10:38 am CST ) Yesterday I completely forgot this , but it was the 1st-month anniversary of TrekToday . It sure seems like much longer , though . In the past month , we 've already seen the hit figures double - thanks to all of you who visit us regularly ! <p> Hot on the heels of Trek news site Warp 11 joining us as our first hosted site , comes the news of our second hosted site ! Star Trek : Hypertext is the site of Jamahl Epsicokhan , author of Jammer 's reviews . Saleel and I are very happy to welcome Jamahl to the Trekzone Network - his reviews always provide us with a good read , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Odo wo n't die ... he 's going to be a " changed " man whatever that may be . <p> My source confirmes that Rom will be Grand Nagus in The Dogs of War . The Ferengi part is the B-story of this episode . <p> The full update also contains surprising info on the fate of the Cardassians - go check it out ! <p> What Gene Would Have WantedChristian ( 1:26 pm CST ) Warp 11 has just posted transcripts of two letters that appeared in the Star Trek Communicators Issues 120 and 121 . In the first letter , a fan talks about the possibility of Star Trek exploring a continuing war . In the next letter , Majel Barrett Roddenberry responds to this , saying that : <p> Gene would never now or then create a series around an on-going , all-out intergalactic war . Gene knew absolutely nothing about science or technology . He wrote about people and humanity because that 's what he did know . All great drama always comes from people -- humanity . He had comments on society to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be allowed . So he dressed his people strangely and put them in space and spoke about what he wanted to . Gene loved humanity and certainly did not love war . There are quotes that would fill a book on his anti-war policies . <p> Take a look at the full transcripts for more - very interesting considering DS9 's upcoming war arc . <p> Spell Casting Which actor should play the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings adaptations ? <p> One of the people you can vote for is Patrick Stewart , who has received 28% of the votes as I 'm writing this . He 's being beaten by Sean Connery , though , so go vote and make sure that does n't happen ; - ) ! <p> On Thursday , May 27th , from 6:30-9:00 pm , the Museum of Television and Radio will premiere the two-hour finale of Deep Space Nine . Rick Berman and Ira Steven Behr , and members of the cast , will be on hand . Call ( 310 ) 786-1091 for more information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " What You Leave Behind " is the title for the finale . That , folks , *is* the title ( unless they change it later , which is always possible ) . Somehow I do n't think Arnold is going to be too popular among the DS9 staff for letting that out . <p> Yesterday Josh Brandon reported the same thing in this post , after Richard Arnold had mentioned the title at an Australian convention . Maybe this means the ' Rom becomes Grand Nagus ' rumour is actually true as well ... <p> Note that I still would n't be 100% certain that ' What You Leave Behind ' is the actual episode title - it 's the fourth already , and we could very well be hearing about other titles soon . <p> Happy Birthday William Shatner ! Christian ( 11:45 am CST ) Today is the 68th birthday of William Shatner , known to fans around the world as Captain James Tiberius Kirk . Over the past 33 years , Shatner has established himself as probably the most recognized face in the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather unique way of looking at things ( can you say ' Get a Life ' ? ) .

From the information and spoilers I have in my mailbox and from friends ... well let me say I think all the fans are in for a shock . DS9 is going to end with an unexpected twist . ( Yes , I have been crystal ball gazing ! LOL ) . <p> The issue also contains an announcement of TrekToday , so how could we not love it : - ) ?

For years now , the STZone has been providing some great sites , including the Utopia Planitia Fleetyards and the Great Link . Unfortunately , the STZone 's owner Chris Gough has now announced the site will be closing down : <p> After Viewing the STZ statistics over the last month I have made every effort to maintain the site to the best possible standards , however ultimately the result is final . You people have been visiting the site WAY too much . Over Popularity killed the cat . Do n't feel bad - it was inevitable . <p> ... <p> When we first signed up for the simplenet account , the policies stated " Unlimited Traffic " . However within a month of us moving there , they changed this to Unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any site within the Top 5% of site traffic would get a nice $200 bill each month that they stayed there . I was annoyed however we managed the get the traffic down to an acceptable level . 6 Gig a month in transfers from 8 Gig . Simplenet told us we were close to the top 5% . <p> ... <p> So , here we are - I am facing a $200 bill , the renewal on the site and a great many headaches I could do without . The only option is to close the STZ . Utopia I and II have , as you read this - gone . The site has been taken down for many reasons - the primary one is Bandwidth saving - if everyone rushed to the site and started to download everything , I will get that bill ... <p> More on this can be found in the full announcement . Also , in light of the STZone 's closure , two of its hosted sites have already announced they will be moving . News site The Great Link will be moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account has been set up , while newsletter The Secured Channel has already moved to its new location at http : **27;830;TOOLONG . <p> More Final Chapter InfoChristian ( 12:04 pm CST ) The Great Link has received extra info on the last three episodes of DS9 's Final Chapter . Apparently Paramount has launched a massive misinformation campaign , as the series finale has now received yet another title - ' Kingdom Come . ' A short summary of the most important news items : <p> ' Night Tremors , ' episode 7 of the Final Chapter , is mainly a Bashir/O'Brien episode ( the last of the series ) , which also involves Director Sloan and Section 31 . Expect to see story threads running throughout this episode for Kira , Damar and Garak . <p> ' The Dogs Of War ' are apparently the Ferengi , as The Ferengi bunch , which we previously said would be appearing in " Night Tremors " , will now be appearing in the B-story for " The Dogs of War " . Note that Cecily Adams will be returning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the title of the series finale - I see could be , as this is already the third title we 've heard . Although the Great Link is n't revealing all plot information , ' if my source is correct , then Dukat will have a very big smile at the start of this episode - events will have gone extremely well for him up to this point . And elsewhere , the Dominion will be preparing to launch a major offensive . ' <p> More on this can be found at the Great Link . Other Final Chapter news was posted today to the Trekweb message board . In ome postJose Gonzalez mentions that , as of last Wednesday , ' Kingdom Come ' was not the title for the finale . <p> In Another post , Josh Brandon talks about a convention in Australia where William Shatner and Richard Arnold appeared . I have my doubts about the reliability of this , but in this post it is said that the finale is titled ' What You Leave Behind . ' The post also mentions that *Rom* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also mentions that Shatner said he has been approached for Star Trek X. Once again , I would n't believe this until it is confirmed elsewhere . <p> PC Action Previews Birth of the FederationChristian ( 11:44 am CST ) Paul Weaver at FedCom is reporting that the German gaming magazine PC Action has done a massive preview of ' Birth of the Federation , ' the upcoming strategy game . The preview is the month 's main highlight , as you can see from the cover image to the left . In the preview , there is also an interview with lead designer Jeff Holzhauer , in which he confirms the game will go gold on the 15th of April , so the game should be in the shops a few weeks later . <p> A teaser version of the preview should be available here , but unfortunately it is n't yet . However , once I myself get the magazine , I 'll scan the article in again and report on what it actually says .

Christian ( 10:46 am CST ) Sorry to all of you who do n't run in the same screen resolution as I do . I just saw yesterday 's update on a computer with a lower resolution , and I noticed that yesterday 's Lego picture really messed up the site 's lay-out . I 'll try to avoid that in the future . <p> Mark Altman , of Broadcast Operations at UPN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an hour . He is very nice , patient , understanding , and caring . And he has been a Trekker ( his word ) , so he relates to our concerns . <p> ... <p> He said that Voyager is not going from 43 to 41 minutes , but from 46 to 44 . He said that DS9 , as it is made to go directly to syndication , is more likely to be 41 or 42 minutes long , and that possibly the Paramount person who gave me the information mixed up the 2 shows . He explained that the show 's makers had two choices : lessen the length of the show by filming two minutes less ( or cutting ) , or use a method he called " time compression . " I had never heard of this . He said it consists of very slightly speeding up the whole show so that it takes up two minutes less . They chose the first option . <p> Although the full report mentions that protests will probably be useless , it does contain the address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the dates for Star Trek : Insurrection , which originally had an order cut off date of May 7 , 1999 and a street date of May 25 , 1999 .

Take a look at the full report for more . <p> The newest section of this site , The Flagship : Star Trek X , is now ready . The Flagship has been around since mid-1995 , and I 'm certainly glad to keep it going--I get great pleasure from doing so . I suspect many of you have been around here for a little while , so let me just say that this site will follow the example put forth in the First Contact and Insurrection sites . <p> Currently the only thing available at the STX Information Site is a short FAQ ( mainly because the film has n't even gone beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more info will become available over the next few months/years . <p> Stewart Hopes For Fellow BritsChristian ( 1:29 pm CST ) As we reported yesterday , Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) will be one of the presenters at this weekend 's Oscar ceremonies . Stewart , who is currently finishing a television movie of Charles Dicken 's ' Christmas Carol , ' has said he was hoping that two British actros might win : <p> Stewart , a veteran English theater actor before becoming Capt . Jean-Luc Picard on Star Trek : The Next Generation , ' ' said he is hoping this year 's Oscar recipients will include British theater legends Ian McKellen ( Gods and Monsters ' ' ) and Judi Dench ( Shakespeare In Love ' ' ) .

Christian ( 1:22 pm CST ) Today is the 51st birthday of John DeLancie , who is probably best known for his role as the omnipotent Q. DeLancie has guest starred as Q in all three Trek series , but unfortunately the last time he appeared on Voyager is already three years ago . Meanwhile , DeLancie is n't sitting around doing nothing . Together with Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) , he formed Alien Voices , which is performing classic science fiction stories the way they used to be done on the radio . More on DeLancie can be found on the John DeLancie Tribute page , which is also where I found the above picture . <p> -Stanley 's Star Trek Page is a site dedicated entirely to Star Trek , containing links to the best Trek sites .

This afternoon , I arrived at a station somewhere in the middle of nowhere , only to learn that my train had just left . 25 minutes later , the next train arrived . I got on the train , for about three minutes , and then got off when we arrived at Utrecht Central Station ( sort of like the hub of the Dutch railway system . ) There I learned that I had to wait *another* 25 minutes , because the only train to my hometown had just left . Anyways , that 's why I 'm beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry . <p> In other , completely unrelated news , take a look at this news report at the Den 's Daily Sci-Fi . In the report , you 'll get to see pictures of the new Star Wars lego line ! How I wish there 'd also be a lego U.S.S. Enterprise ... : - ) <p> My number 2 source had some interesting news late last night . According to him executive producer Brannon Braga has absolutely no intention in bringing anymore AQ species to the Delta Quadrant . And as far as he is concerned we 'll not see Voyager return at all ! Also off-topic are Kes and the Kazon . So in this light it seems that the initial reports are incorrect ! <p> In response to that , the webmaster of the Vulcan Cafe sent a mail to Warp 11 , informing the site that : <p> The season finale is still Warhead and Equinox as described . I do n't know what " warp 11 " is so concerned about , since nobody here mentioned bring other AQ races into Voyager anyway ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full e-mail is n't quite as hostile as this excerpt makes it sound . In the mail , some things about the last two episodes and Voyager 's future are clarified , as you can see in the Warp 11 report where this mail is printed . <p> SteveKrutzler From TheTom : So far this year we 've had no O'Brien A-stories and only a pair or so of O'Brien B-stories . Please tell us the chief gets the spotlight at some point in the Final Chapter . BradleyThompson O'Brien and Bashir will have a turn in these last ten . Saw the dailies and it looks wonderful . <p> SteveKrutzler From BrerMike : Does the tenacity of the fans and their sometimes obsessive opinions on yours or the other writers work , ever offend you or affect your creativity ? BTW - Kudos on an excellent television show ! BradleyThompson Thanks for the Kudos and of course we get horribly offended when someone does n't like our stuff . David has been known to go into a psychotic rage and punch refrigerators when angered . : - ) Regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our fellow writers on the show .

And plan revenge . <p> The full transcript , only available in a TXT-format to ensure maximum readability , can be found here . In the chat , we also learn that ' Umbra ' and ' Eclipse , ' two of the upcoming Final Chapter episodes , have actually been given new names . This was reported by several sites a few days ago , but later on the official Paramount press releases still called the episodes by their old names . Now ' Umbra ' will presumably be called ' Till Death Do Us Part , ' while ' Eclipse ' will be called ' Strange Bedfellows .

The episode fell to a 4.1 rating , ranking 19th and tying it with several episodes for lowest-rated ever DS9 episode honors . However , the same 4.1 rating secured DS9 's second straight sweeps month as the syndicated drama king . <p> DS9 was first on the week by quite a bit , seeing Xena fall to a 3.7 and Hercules to a 3.6 . Both Xena and Herc looked like they were gaining ground in recent weeks , but with this fall off and DS9 's coming final nine episodes on the way , DS9 has all but wrapped up a season as the number one weekly syndicated drama on TV . <p> Star Trek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canny do it Cap'n ' and all that ?

The new schedule , which can be found here , lists all the upcoming trade books , and also provides info on a new non-fiction book called ' New Worlds , New Civilizations : ' <p> It 's the 1999 coffee-table book Margaret and I are co-editing . Think of it as National Geographic for the 24th century . It 's written by Andre Bormanis , with loads of all-new painted and CG artwork by a number of artists . <p> Guess what I 'm putting on my Christmas wish list this year ; - ) ? <p> No Encounter With Fed Ship On Voyager ? Christian ( 12:53 pm CST ) According to recent reports from the Vulcan Cafe and other sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to deal with the USS Equinox , a Federation ship that was also transported to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker . However , today Warp 11 is reporting that this may not actually be true : <p> My number 2 source had some interesting news late last night . According to him executive producer Brannon Braga has absolutely no intention in bringing anymore AQ species to the Delta Quadrant . And as far as he is concerned we 'll not see Voyager return at all ! Also off-topic are Kes and the Kazon . So in this light it seems that the initial reports are incorrect ! I know this is strange , because I believe that the guys at The Vulcan Cafe claim their spoilers were confirmed by Brannon Braga himself ! <p> If I recall correctly , Brannon Braga only confirmed the Doctor story from those two episodes , but this news is certainly very strange ! Personally I do n't find it very surprising Braga does n't want Voyager to return - I recently heard a story from someone who had done a pitch session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be coming home next season , and there would n't be any cast changes . Also , the writers did not want to go back to anything that happened before the fourth season , which would indeed rule out Kes and the Kazon . More on all this will be presented to you as soon as I hear about it . <p> DS9 Finale Title Not Certain YetChristian ( 12:43 pm CST ) Yesterday , Trek news site Warp 11 was reporting that the DS9 finale would be called ' Fin de SiFcle , ' and would have a very surprising guest cast ( including Vedek Bareil and Jennifer Sisko ) . Now , however , it seems that the finale title is n't certain yet , as the Sci-Fi World is reporting the finale will be called ' Eleventh Hour . ' Both sites are claiming to have heard this from their own , reliable , sources , so I guess we 'll just have to wait and see how the episode ends up being called . <p> This issue of Optical Data Network features a couple news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS9 , and the other about a new game being developed for Activision . Beyond that is the standard variety of NewsBits . <p> ... <p> Getting back on track , there 's a full compliment of schedules , from the US ( updated through the end of both series , although we 're missing the titles of both season finales ) , to the UK . ... Rounding out this issue is an updated book listing from David Henderson at Psi Phi , a new site in the Spotlight , and a couple of Letters ( Transmissions ) . <p> The Spotlight site is actually TrekToday , while ODN is also carrying the announcement of the new PBeM Steven Hartzog is currently developing here at the Trekzone Network , and for which he needs VB , VC++ , Java or XML programmers . Our thanks go out to ODN for this ! <p> Anyways , check out the new ODN issue for a comprehensive round-up of all the Trek news that 's fit to print ! <p> Bradley Thompson Chat TonightChristian ( 11:29 am CST ) Trekweb is organising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive story editor for Deep Space Nine . With his background , there should certainly be enough questions to ask him during the chat , according to the Trekweb info page : <p> Bradley Thompson has been a staff writer on Deep Space Nine with his writing partner David Weddle since the departing Robert Hewitt Wolfe left a vacancy in the writing staff after the end of the fifth season . This season , Bradley and David have written the teleplays for such episodes as " Treachery , Faith and the Great River " and " Prodigal Daughter , " and have been promoted to Executive Story Editors .

However , now it seems that this is n't the only title in development for Activision , as a company press release from ' Intergraph Computer Systems ' mentions a Star Trek : Armada game . The press release talks about a new super-fast workstation that can be used for developing 3D graphics , a workstation that is apparently being put to good use : <p> Tim Miller , CEO of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles such as the new Star Trek Armada from Activision takes massive amounts of CPU power , so a performance increase like we 've seen with these new machines let 's us go where no one has gone before ' a lot faster .

' Yesterday , I had actually changed the date bar to read ' Wednesday March 17,1999 - Saint Patrick 's Day , ' but unfortunately our news script could n't handle that and decided to wipe out all my posts . I fixed it , but that also meant I had too loose the lovely ' Saint Patrick 's Day ' text : - ( . Better luck next time , I suppose . <p> Warp 11 has received extra info from its source ' Number One .

Moesha barely defeated " Extreme Risk " with a 2.7 , putting Voyager in UPN 's #2 spot for only the second or third time this year . <p> Of course , the full report has more to offer on this . The site also promises us that the Voyager ratings report for the entire month of February will be up soon , which we 'll of course be telling you about as soon as it appears . <p> Sci-Fi Channel To Start Web BroadcastsChristian ( 11:10 am CST ) Sci-Fi Wire , the Sci-Fi Channel 's news service , is repoting that the station will start showing some of its programmes via the Net starting this Friday , March 19 .

' Finally , Sci-Fi World is reporting that Odo , too , has contracted the disease the Founders are infected with - making the possibility of his death at the end of the series a lot more likely . <p> New Voyager InfoChristian ( 1:32 pm CST ) Note that this update contains massive spoilers for the last two Voyager episodes . If you want to avoid that , click here to skip over them . <p> First up , the Vulcan Cafe has some info on ' Warhead , ' the penultimate episode of the season : <p> Voyager runs into another federation ship that was also pulled to the Delta quad by the Caretaker . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , and they have basically thrown the Prime Directive out the window in order to find any way possible to get home . Supposedly , they have learned some way to harness energy from a previously unseen alien race to power their ship to speed them home , however the process kills the aliens - but the science vessel crew does n't care . The crew apparently removed the docs ethical sub-routines so that he would figure out a way to suck the juice out of the aliens . At some point the evil doc gets switched with the good doc , but nobody knows it , and that is the basis of episode #25 , Warhead . <p> This story was later confirmed by Brannon Braga himself . Thanks to Sci-Fi World there even is some more info available on this episode : <p> The Nova-Class Equinox is on the run from the aliens who are appearing on the ship through fissures . The Equinox encountered the Kazon at one point . Max Burke , the First Officer , used to be B'Elanna 's boyfriend at the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Burke . <p> Moving on , it appears that ' Warhead ' is connected with the final episode of the season , which might be called ' Equinox ' ( after the science vessel , ) acoording to Sci-Fi World . It is now confirmed that Species 8472 will not be appearing in this episode . Star Trek News recently reported that the episode had something to do with the theft of Voyager 's holo-emitters , which in turn should be connected to the holodoc story mentioned above . Some info on the final episode from the Vulcan Cafe : <p> Then , in the finale , the aliens which had been talked about in the previous episode aliens show up , rather pissed off , and lead us into the cliffhanger for the season . ... Brannon Braga wants the new aliens to " give 9 year old audience members nightmares " . <p> ' Equinox ' will be a cliffhanger , to be concluded next season . This probably also means that the ' Voyager Returns Home ' rumour is just that - a rumour . Voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to pitch stories for a while now - Voyager wo n't be going home , and there will be no cast changes . <p> More news on all of this will , of course , be reported as I get it . Thanks go out to the above sites , plus Warp 11 and The Great Link for most of the above . <p> Things are pretty much finished here . There 's a nasty bug that does n't display the user 's ICQ UIN on new topics , but I 'm working on that ... <p> Report any other bugs to me ASAP ! Thanks ! : - ) <p> As the above quote shows , some work still needs to be done on the forums , but they are now officially open for business . Go check them out ! . <p> Meanwhile , things are n't going that well on the SFCR . Only a few posts have been made to the forums in the past few weeks , while just 27 people are still registered on the forums . Hopefully the SFCR owners will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd advice you to visit the Solarflare Forums instead . <p> In case you 're interested , I 'd like to remind you that we published an article examining the SFCR split-up two weeks ago , which can still be found by clicking here . <p> Were you ever watching a Star Trek flick or television episode and felt the overwhelming desire to take command of a Federation starship and kick some Klingon or Romulan butt ? Or perhaps you have longed to uncloak a Klingon Bird of Prey right behind that pesky Enterprise and pummel it with plasma torpedoes ? For those of you out there with obsessive-compulsive Star Trek disorder , Interplay 's Starfleet Command wants to satisfy that urge . There have been Star Trek games before in which you were able to command a single starship in a 3D space combat mode ala Wing Commander . However , this really never fulfilled the need to completely command a fleet of starships . Starfleet Command puts you in the Captain 's and Admiral 's chair for real-time tactical combat between those well known and powerful warships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , including a look at its story , gameplay , graphics and multiplayer capabilities , can be found in the full preview .

Of course , this means that if you get here and are greeted with almost no news at all , just come back a few hours later , and I can assure you that you wo n't be disappointed ... <p> You all are cordially invited to take part in a chat with John Ordover Senior Star Trek Editor , Pocket Books and ask the questions you want answered the most . <p> This will be a moderated chat , with FADM Michael Frisbee , moderating . You will post your questions to one of our designated Channel Ops , and they will be posted to Mr Ordover in the order received . The chat will begin promptly at 10 minutes after the hour , please do not be late . <p> Starbase Prometheus has also announced that it 'll soon be hosting a chat with the ' Empress of Star Trek , ' Majel Barrett-Roddenberry soon , more news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes available . <p> Update Sunday Morning , 08:26 CET - As you may have noticed , the chat was n't scheduled for Saturday , but for today , Sunday . Unfortunately I misread the date . The chat will be taking place today at 9:00pm GMT / 4:00PM Eastern Time . Sorry ! <p> In a couple of weeks ( or less ) , the first regular assortment of 12 " Collector Series figures will begin arriving at many retailers . Each figure will come in TV series specific packaging as one of four on-going subsets . <p> Characters from Star Trek : The Next Generation will ship in the same packaging as the 12 " Star Trek : Insurrection line . Voyager characters will have aqua-colored boxes with the U.S.S. Voyager on the side . Characters from The Original Series will ship in orange-colored boxes with the original U.S.S. Enterprise on them . <p> The four figures that will be released now are an Andorian Ambassador , Captain Kathryn Janeway , Commander Geordi LaForge and Mister Spock . For more on this , check out the full update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As usual , the videos were created by the Sci-Fi Headquarters , and they 're in Real Video format . Speaking of the Sci-Fi Headquarters , they just issued their ' Summer of Media ' press release , which you might find interesting : <p> After the month of May Trek will go into reruns , but not at SCIFI Headquarters . We will have exclusive interviews , behind the scenes and other never seen Trek media . Download the promo below for a greart sample . Please view it . I sent 3 hours making this 1 minute video . <p> The summer should prove interesting as well , then , and of course we at TrekToday will keep you informed about this . <p> Insurrection Video Release DateChristian ( 11:49 am CST ) Planet Riker is reporting that the North American release date for the ' Insurrection ' home video is May 18 . This is n't exactly smart timing , as ' Star Wars : Episode One ' will be released a day later , but I 'm sure the people at Paramount have their reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of DS9 will be closely connected and form " The Final Chapter " - is there any chance there will be a " The Final Chapter " series instead of just one book for the final episode - I think you owe DS9 at least that . <p> Response from : John Ordover It 's not a matter of what we owe , it 's a matter of what can be produced in the limited time we have . At the moment , it 's nit-and-tuck whether we 'll be able to novelize even the final episode . <p> " Field of Fire " took a heavy dip in the second week of sweeps , falling to a season-low 4.1 , ranking 21st . With that 4.1 , " Field of Fire " also ties " Tears of the Prophets " and " The Sound of Her Voice " with DS9 all-time low " honors . " That rating places DS9 down 15% from last year 's " Far Beyond the Stars " ( 4.8 ) and off 11% from last week 's " The Emperor 's New Cloak " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did slightly better : <p> " Chimera " recovered the ground lost by " Field of Fire , " returing to DS9 's average mark this season , earning a 4.3 , ranking 21st . With that rating , this episode increased 5% over last week 's " Field of Fire " ( 4.1 ) , but as usual fell from last year 's " One Little Ship " ( 5.1 ) by 16% . <p> ... <p> It is good to see that last week was more of a fluke than anything else , but other than that , " Chimera " does little other than hold the line . DS9 is still in very good shape to take firstrun syndicated weekly honors for the second sweeps month in a row , but that depends entirely on next week . With " Chimera , " DS9 also maintains its lead over Hercules and Xena on the season . Next week is the last show which does n't lead up to the finale . <p> What was it like being on the set of Star Trek : Voyager ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soundstages for the first time . I sat in Captain Janeway 's chair on the bridge and I read all the little labels on the different control displays . They write funny things on them and then make them look like real controls . <p> How do you feel , being so young , about the opportunity to appear on a series that has such a strong following ? It 's really cool to be on a show that has so many fans who really know the characters so well . My brother taught me about the show before I ever auditioned for it ( he 's a big fan too ) , and I was really excited when I found out I got the part . I hope people will like Naomi , because she is so much fun to play . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:34 am CST ) -In the UK , Sky One is showing the 2nd-season Voyager episode ' Deadlock ' at 5:00pm GMT , with a rerun at 11:30pm . Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German television station Sat.1 is repeating Voyager 's ' I 'm Rnckblick ' ( Retrospect ) , which originally aired on Friday . <p> -Here in the Netherlands , the AVRO is showing a new Voyager episode at 18:40 CET on Channel One . Rather embarassingly , I have n't got a clue which episode they 're actually showing - Sorry ! <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:18 am CST ) Yesterday we added 3 new sites to the Trekseek database , bringing us to a total of 837 Star Trek links . Some of those new sites are really interesting : <p> -Far Beyond the Stars has Star Trek commentary ; articles ( serious and humorous ) such as Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 : Cosmic Similarities . -The Delta Flyer only site on the internet completely devoted to Delta Flyer , the 24th century ' hot-rod ' . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:13 am CST ) As you may recall , we 're working on a special project related to Raven 's upcoming ' Star Trek : Voyager ' game . Even though I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first need to test it and make sure it actually works ) , I can assure you it 'll be very cool indeed . Together with the project , we 'll also be introducing a slightly changed look for TrekToday - nothing major , but we want to add something to the top of the page . <p> As you know , as it is now the site just starts with the current date , which is n't something we 're very happy with . We want to change this , but we 're wondering , what would you want to see at the top of this page ? The most important headlines ? Links to the archives ? Something else entirely ? I 'd very much appreciate it if you 'd tell me about your ideas , so we can work to make this site even better ! <p> Friday March 12 , 1999 <p> More Final Chapter NewsChristian ( 1:28 pm CST ) Both the Great Link and Warp 11 have posted extra info on DS9 's Final Chapter . First of all , the Great Link is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloan and Section 31 will be returning at least once . On the tenth of March , Thompson posted the following to the alt.tv.star-trek.ds9 newsgroup : <p> Sloan does have a first name , If the scene survives the shooting , and the editing , and the other stuff , you will hear it later this season . <p> After this , Warp 11 put up a Special Rumours section for the Final Chapter , in which all the news on DS9 's final episodes will be compiled . There are some major spoilers there , only visit if you really want to know about them . <p> Sat.1 Showing Voyager AgainChristian ( 1:06 pm CST ) The people at German television station Sat.1 must be very confused - first they announced that last week 's episode ' Beute ' would be the last Voyager episode they 'd broadcast , while today they 're actually showing another new Voyager episode , ' Im Rnckblick . ' The only difference is that the episode is now shown somewhat earlier , at 19:15 CET . <p> Of course , one wonders why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first alienate all the fans from them with their shocking decision , and then simply come back from that decision ? This ( German ) article at the German Star Trek Index talks about exactly that , I 'd advice you to read it if you 're interested in the matter . <p> I 've got the " Chimera " ratings , but I 've been so swamped I have n't been able to post them . The episode earned a 4.3 , behind Xena and Hercules . The report for that episode and the chart data will be up tommorrow when I 've got the time . Also , the " Field of Fire " ratings were either reprocessed or finished out of the top 20 . At present , it 'll just go onto the chart as unavailable and wo n't be counted into any averages . <p> Besides that , the overnight ratings report for Voyager 's ' Extreme Risk ' rerun has been added , looking at last Wednesday 's episode . <p> This past Saturday , March 6 , Jeri Ryan joined Avery Brooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award posthumously to " Star Trek " creator Gene Roddenberry during the taping of " Hollywood Salutes Easter Seals . " This two-hour nationally syndicated special will air in most markets nationwide on March 27 and March 28 . ( Some newspapers are apparently running a picture of Jeri from the taping -- if anyone can provide us with a scan , please e-mail Greg . ) <p> ' Trekkies ' Sneak Preview TodayChristian ( 12:37 pm CST ) Today , Paramount will release the new documentary ' Trekkies , ' starring Denise Crosby ( Tasha Yar ) , in Portland , Oregon and Indianapolis , Indiana . The 87-minute film takes a look at the Trek fans , and also has appearances by many famous Star Trek stars . Specific information on where to see ' Trekkies ' can be found by going here . <p> Hail " The Deciphers , " the new honors in which you , the fans and players , decide which Decipher CCG products and cards are best . Nominations have been set by Decipher 's art , marketing and game design teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is up to you . <p> I am very pleased to announce that Diane Duane will be writing two new RIHANNSU books for us , to be published in the fall of 2000 . <p> As you may know , ' Rihannsu ' is how the Romulans called themselves in several Classic Trek novels by Diane Duane . Although the Romulans received a great backstory in these novels , Paramount decided not to go with that backstory when they developed TNG , and the Rihannsu slipped away to non-continuity hell . However , now there 'll finally be more Rihannsu books : <p> They will be TOS books , pretty much picking up where the others left off . All liscensing asked is that we put in a note explainain where the Rihannsu concept comes from that it 's off-continuity now . <p> More news will be posted here as it becomes available , of course . However , Irish fans of Diane Duane might want to ask her exactly what she 's planning to put in the two new novels during ' MeCon 2 , ' a science-fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Belfast . Take a look at the convention page of the Owl Springs Partnership ( Diane Duane 's homepage ) for more on this convention . <p> ' The 34th Rule ' Chat Transcript AvailableChristian ( 12:18 pm CST ) Trekweb 's chat with the authors of the new DS9 novel ' The 34th Rule ' actually took place yesterday , even though author David R. George III was only able to type two sentences before technical difficulties knocked his connection out . Fortunately co-authors Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) and Eric A. Stillwell were available , and they were able to answer a lot of questions . Take a look at some of the highlights : <p> From McReynolds : Are you more pleased with the final outcome of " The 34th Rule " being a novel , or would you have still preferred that it be produced as an episode ? <p> David says ( via phone ) : I would have liked to have sold an episode of DS9 , but I 'm actually delighted with the way the book turned out and how people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its 1000 times better as a novel than an episode <p> From Allyn : Was the characterization of Quark in the 34TH RULE closer to Armin 's conception of the character than the show actually portrays , because I found in the novel Quark to be more serious than in the show , and was the novel in some ways a reaction to the typical " frivolous " Ferengi episode ? <p> David says : This is a great question . The answer is yes , in my own case , the Ferengi in general and Quark in particular are too often portrayed as comic relief ... You 've been reading my interviews . You 're exactly right . I find the Ferengi not to be taken seriously . I wanted to have my say since the writers of DS-9 were n't going to let me portray what I had in mind.David : Characters that are never dramatic and only comic are n't that interesting to me . <p> This is from early in a game as the federation , with a low tech start . This shows the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and building new colony ships to expand . Since I have not yet encountered any other empires , I do not need to generate any intelligence . <p> There 's also some new multiplayer news , as BotF Multiplayer received extra info from Jeff Holzhauer concerning multiplayer procedures : <p> We only propagate orders between players in a multiplayer game . All results are generated on each individual PC . If one person has different stats than another , different battle results might occur . Eventually , the results on different machines will become so different that the whole game will die . <p> This makes it impossible to cheat for advantage in a multiplayer game . On the other hand , if somebody did hack the resource file and thendistributed the same file to everyone in the game , there would be no problems . As long as everyone uses the same values there wo n't be any problems . <p> More multiplayer news , including info on how to actually play the game with multiple people , can be found here . That is also where you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federation ' tournament that is currently being organised . <p> So the Enterprise is rushing here , there , everywhere , across the Galaxy , delivering medical supplies to Rigel X , shuttling important ambassadors to Procyon IX , heading off Tholian incursions into the fabled Neutral Zone . <p> But what about these mysterious colonies in the Star Trek universe ? Why do n't we ever get to see one of them in detail ? Are they all just one dimensional sets for Kirk , Spock and the rest to say a few lines in front of before roaring off to the next subsector , Romulan ale in hand ? <p> Apparently not , and the full preview goes on to tell you exactly what new worlds ' New Worlds ' has to offer . The preview is accompanied by a huge load of screenshots , so it 'll keep you busy for a while . <p> TV Guide Sci-Fi Section Shuts DownChristian ( 11:13 am CST ) I 'd been wondering what had happened to it for a few weeks now , but apparently TV Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto-forwards to the main TV Guide page , so I suppose they simply removed the entire section . It 's a pity , as they often had interesting articles that also looked at the world of Trek . I 've mailed the people at TV Guide asking them for their reasons for this , I 'll post their response as soon as I get it . <p> Most serious STAR TREK fans will have no need of this book -- they 've already set aside a substantial portion of their available neurons for storing and cataloguing dialogue from their favorite TREK TV shows and movies . On the other hand , anyone NOT obsessed with STAR TREK will find this tome tough going . Frankly , it just made me feel old . As I skimmed through each of its 32 chapters , I was depressed to discover that each consisted of about 10 per cent quotes from the original STAR TREK , my personal favorite , and 90 percent quotes from the movies , THE NEXT GENERATION , DEEP SPACE NINE and STAR TREK VOYAGER . Most of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clearly my work is cut out for me . <p> In the end , Jeff Bond awards the book a ' B , ' his reasons for that can be found in the full review . <p> Right now it is being assumed that UPN is having to do what is known in the industry as " make goods . " Networks normally guarantee a minimum rating for the show the commercial is show in . If the show does n't make that rating , the network has to show the commercial a certain number of times , for free . <p> Well , you ca n't do that in the normally scheduled slots , as it would mean no income at all . So , what happens ? Exactly , they cut program length to make room for the spots they have to run for free . We the viewers have to suffer because of their mistakes . <p> The full article has a detailed run-down of all the cut scenes , and also includes the address of someone to send protest letters to . <p> Today on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Friday evening , the Sci-Fi Channel is showing the TOS 2nd-season episode ' The Ultimate Computer ' at 7:30pm Eastern Time . The episode repeats at 11:30pm . <p> -In the United Kingdom , Sky One is broadcasting Voyager 's second-season episode ' Investigations ' at 5:00pm , with a rerun at 11:30pm . Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> Transwarp Issue 59 AppearsChristian ( 1:59 pm CST ) The issue has n't yet been put up at the Official Transwarp Page , but issue 59 of the weekly Trek newsletter has been published . As usual , the newsletter offers a round-up of all the latest Trek news , upcoming episode schedules , and the ' Star Trek:F un ' section . <p> Of course , the latest Transwarp also includes its weekly opinion poll again . Last week 's question was ' Do you think that Voyager will reach Earth before Janeway departs ? ' , which was generally agreed with . 26 people answered ' Yes , ' while 16 people answered ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that Voyager 's " Dark Frontier " delivered all that it said it would ? ' , so send in your answers to Transwarp . More can be found in the actual newsletter itself , thanks go out to my mailbox for pointing me to this . <p> A rerun of " Extreme Risk " aired last night , it got a 4.1/6 . That 's down 1.1 from last week , but since its a rerun then its okay . My guess for a final rating is 2.5 - 3.0 . <p> Also , this is n't directly Trek-related , but the Universe just launched a Save Crusade Petition , which you might want to sign if you 're a Babylon 5 fan . <p> No Species 8472 For Voyager ? Christian ( 12:45 pm CST ) The Great Link has put up a report of a convention that Jeri Ryan also attended . First of all , Jeri Ryan said we wo n't be seeing Species 8472 again , even though it is rumoured that they will be appearing in the final Voyager episode of the season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Watch Over Me ' episode , Seven of Nine and the Doctor will be singing ' You are my Sunshine ! ' together - that should be interesting ! For more , take a look at the full update . <p> DS9 Final Chapter NewsChristian ( 12:36 pm CST ) Lots of ' Final Chapter ' news has appeared over the past 24 hours , giving us info on changed episode titles , guest appearances and character deaths . First of all , Warp 11 posted the following news item : <p> Number 3 just tipped me that Paramount and the producers have been hiding a possible guest appearance of considerable size . <p> Later on at the Trekweb forums , Warp 11 webmaster Leonard Schuurmans stated that this guest would not be Spock , contrary to the rumour we published yesterday . Another rumour which surfaced a while ago was that Odo would be killed off at the end of DS9 , but Warp 11 is saying that probably wo n't be happening , either : <p> Number 1 says to take the possible death of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ' Final Chapter ' news , Psi Phi has info on some of the Final Chapter episode titles : <p> Episode 19 , the 3rd FC episode , is now called ' Strange Bedfellows ' instead of ' Eclipse . ' <p> Episode 24 , part 8 of the Final Chapter , is called ' The Dogs of War , ' and is directed by Avery Brooks . <p> The two-hour series finale will be directed by Trek veteran Allan Kroeker . <p> Lastly , the Great Link also has some info on the Final Chapter . The first piece of news actually also comes from Psi Phi , but I could n't find the info there myself : <p> " Psi Phi 's source analogizes the final episodes to chapters in a book - some may be grouped together to form sections or acts , but they all go together to tell one story . Most of ' The Final Chapter ' episodes , though , were written to stand on their own - do n't expect cliff-hanger moments at the end of each episode . The continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really focus on them . " <p> It has already been reported that the Breen will somehow be involved in Episode 20 ( ' The Changing Face of Evil ' ) , but not it appears that the Breen may actually be joining the Dominion at some point in the Final Chapter . <p> More news will be posted here as soon as it becomes available , of course . <p> Gary Hutzel Chat TodayChristian ( 11:22 am CST ) Tonight , the Continuum is hosting a live chat with Gary Hutzel , Visual Effects Supervisor on Deep Space Nine . This chat begins just 90 minutes after the Trekweb chat , at 06:30pm PT . Naturally , the Continuum also offers you the chance to submit advance questions , while info on how to participate is also available . <p> ' The 34th Rule ' Chat TodayChristian ( 11:17 am CST ) If we 're lucky , Trekweb will finally be hosting their ' The 34th Rule ' chat this evening .

A Voyager producer told the New York Daily News recently that Alexander would slip into his alien likeness by donning " Albert Einstein hair and a funny forehead . " <p> Recently , GameFan online was invited to check out Interplay 's latest crop of Star Trek titles from their newly-created 14 Degrees East , where we were lucky enough to get a sneak peak at three Trek titles : Starfleet Command , Klingon Academy , and New Worlds , as well as take a tour of the actual Star Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to bring you the goods , straight from the event . <p> The preview then goes on to talk about Klingon Academy , the upcoming space simulator , and this is accompanied by several screenshots and five MPEG-video clips showing the game in action . The Gamefan guys were pretty impressed with ' Klingon Academy : ' <p> The story of Klingon Academy is actually a prequel to the film Star Trek VI : Undiscovered Country , and will include several well-known Trekkies as part of the cast . General Chang , the baddest mofo in the empire has started a school for all the wanna-be Klingon conquerors , and if you think you have what it takes , you can sign up to get yourself an edumacation , Klingon style . <p> We did n't get much else in the way of plot , but one thing we did see was one hell of an engine .

Thanks go out to Evil Avatar for pointing me to this . <p> Happy Birthday Star Trek ! Christian ( 10:32 am CST ) Happy Birthday Star Trek ? Well , yes . In a way , today is the 35th anniversary of the series we all love , as on the 11th of March , 1964 , Gene Roddenberyy sent the first Star Trek proposal to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . According to Allan Asherman 's Star Trek Compendium , Roddenberry was asked by MGM to come up with an idea for a new series to replace his short-lived ' The Lieutenant ' series . <p> On the 11th of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures of Captain Robert T. April , ' Number One ' and JosT Ortegas aboard the S.S. Yorktown . Unfortunately for them , MGM turned down the series idea , and Roddenberry approached Desilu Studios instead . There his idea was greeted a lot more enthusiastically , and Roddenberry started developing his new series . Of course , that was the beginning of a science-fiction epic that is still going strong today , in a bigger way than Roddenberry could ever have imagined when he started it all . Happy birthday , Star Trek , and thank you , Gene . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:22 am CST ) -In the US , the Sci-Fi Channel is showing the second-season TOS episode ' The Omega Glory , ' which was actually once considered as the TOS pilot episode , at 7:30pm Eastern Time .

Christian ( 10:00 am CST ) More and more reports are coming in that the final DS9 episode will have a ' guest appearance of considerable size ' ( quote taken from Warp 11 . ) Although that would undoubtedly attract a lot of viewers to the final episode , I 'm not sure if such a guest appearance should really be made the highlight of the final episode . <p> Over the past seven years , Deep Space Nine has proven itself as a wonderful television series that many consider the best Trek ever made . They accomplished this by giving us intelligent stories and wonderful character arcs . Should n't the final episode reflect that as well , then ? Personally I 'd much rather see the final episode focusing on the ' Emissary ' plot instead of on , say , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm not sure if a major guest appearance would really serve to accomplish that . br&gt; <p> Back from the extended hiatus .

Christian ( 2:01 pm CST ) WebTrek has a small news tidbit up , saying that there is a chance Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) might be making a small appearance in the DS9 series finale . According to WebTrek , his involvement might have something to do with the Romulans , which would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a rumour , it certainly has n't been confirmed yet , but it is extremely interesting . <p> SteveKrutzlerFrom Rafael Scholl : I admire your work for VOY und DS9 . I 'm curious : How do you tackle to task of scoring an episode ? Do you intentionally use some motives throughout the seasons or is this , honestly , just a by-product of the fact that you ca n't be expected to come up with new ideas all the time ? <p> CaptMusic I have written specific motives for character development and I try to use them wherever possible . Chakotay has his unique sound as does the Doc on Voyager . The time constraints are such that the musical styles of each composer , i 'm sure are readily identifiable . <p> SteveKrutzler From AndrewR : do you know who is slated to compose for the DS9 finale ? <p> CaptMusic Dennis will be scoring the two hour finale on DS9 . I will be doing the season ender on Voyager . <p> The full transcript can be found as a txt-file here , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't able to access it . <p> " Course : Oblivion " recovered much of " The Disease " ' s lost audience , providing a fairly strong 3.7 rating , 6 share up against the Monica Lewinsky interview . That 's up 8% from last week 's " Disease " ( 3.4 ) but down 12% from last year 's two-hour show , " The Killing Game " ( 4.2 ) . <p> ... <p> Indeed , this show did drop Voyager 's February mark to a 3.93 , down slightly from last February 's 4.03 , squandering a very good shot for Voyager to beat its year-ago mark . On the good news side , this episode did keep Voyager above November 's mark , becoming the first time Voyager 's February mark for a season was higher than the November mark . On an individual episode note , this show again proved that the brief drop-off last week was a fluke , contining Voyager 's level ratings performance this year . The ratings report will go more deeply into these issues . It 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be informing you when the Database 's February report comes online .

As two of the writers attached to the project are Trek writers Ron Moore and Brannon Braga , I thought it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the article by going here . <p> While other companies have gone where no man has gone before - and come up with some of the worst Star Trek games imaginable - Raven is taking a slightly different approach than its failed competitors . When the license was given to the team , Brian says the group sat down and decided , " First of all , let 's put Star Trek aside and make a first-person shooter . " Raven took the idea to Paramount ( who is aware that Star Trek titles up to this point have n't been all that great ) and said , " All we want to do is make a great game . " The team took this attitude with them when they approached Paramount . When Raven finally laid down some of its early plans with Raven 's proven track record , Paramount gave its approval . <p> The full preview also provides the info that there 'll probably be a short playable demo for this may 's ' E3 ' show , and tells us how Raven actually began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1:23 pm CST ) In this Nielsen Media Research Report that looks at the 20 prime-time television programs for the week beginning March 1 , Voyager comes out as the top-rated UPN show again .

Cuts like " The Enterprise , " " Leaving Drydock " and " The Meld " were initially heard on the LP released along with the film in 1979 , but eight tunes , including " Spock 's Arrival , " " The Force Field , " " Inner Workings " and " Vejur Speaks , " were previously unavailable . <p> The second " bonus " disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek .

This time , co-author Eric A. Stillwell was called out of town for business . The chat has now been re-scheduled for Thursday , March 11th , at 5:00pm PST . Advance questions to Eric and his co-authors Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) and David R.

Our games are proof of our commitment to this mission . ' ' The new division has brought together a remarkable team of producers , designers , artists and technical engineers dedicated to creating strategy games . This select group of hard-core gamers turned game makers will continue to be on the cutting edge when it comes to design and execution of every product released by 14 Degrees East . <p> Unfortunately , still no mention is made of the ' Secret of Vulcan Fury ' game , whose future seems more and more uncertain . In any case , more on this new Interplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurrection Still Gowing StrongChristian ( 11:35 am CST ) This weekend , ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' continued its run in budget theatres , still doing very well there . The movie dropped on place to number 23 , taking in $412,886 . Even though this was a 27% decrease , it still took the movie to a total cumulative gross of 69,567,327 - there is still a good chance of the movie reaching the $70 million mark . More info on this can be found in this report at Yahoo ! <p> Also , ' Insurrection ' is still running in several other countries besides the US , and that is what this report talks about : <p> In France , ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' ( foreign total : $36.8 million ) grossed 15% less than ' Star Trek : First Contact , ' with $450,916 , but it was livelier in Singapore , with $107,632 . <p> Raven Games Developing Voyager GameChristian ( 11:28 am CST ) Noted game developer Raven announced yesterday that the company will be developing a ' Star Trek : Voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten-year license to publish Star Trek games . Take a look at the official announcement by Raven Project Director Brian Raffel : <p> I am pleased to announce that Raven Software will be developing a Star Trek : Voyager game for Activision . The title will encompass the attributes of both intense first-person shooter action and team oriented combat , as you play the role of a security officer fighting alongside your fellow security team members . Drawing from the rich Star Trek universe , we will be focusing our efforts into creating the most amazing first-person shooter yet , with new and intriguing gameplay elements . We are developing new AI and Scripting systems so that the NPC 's and enemies will intelligently react to their surroundings and situation . At this time we are in the early stages of development and more information will be forthcoming . <p> Look for us showing this title at E3 in May ! <p> After this announcement , several Raven programmers , designers and artists also commented on this , making several enthusiastic statements such as ' Booyah ! ! Booyah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ) In any case , this certainly is good news for Star Trek game fans . Although a lot of Trek games have been quite good , ( ' Starfleet Academy , ' for instance ) none of them ever really made their way to the general public in the way other games did . With Raven developing the game , this could actually become an absolutely great Trek game ! <p> In the past , Raven has been responsible for the ' Heretic ' and ' Hexen ' series of games , which were all first-person shooters . All these games were based on the ' Doom ' and ' Quake ' engines created by i 'd Software , and it is reasonable to assume that the Voyager game will be based on an i 'd engine as well . As a matter of fact , considering the symbiotic relationship Raven and i 'd have had over the past years , I would n't be at all surprised if ' Voyager ' is based around the engine of the upcoming ' Quake : Arena ' engine . If that is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful multiplayer capabilities . <p> The project is being headed by experienced Raven man Brian Pelletier , but so far I have n't seen any statements from him . Of course , we 'll be presenting you with more news on all of this as it becomes available . I myself am rather excited about this - maybe now there 'll finally be an absolutely perfect Trek game . Also , as I already mentioned in ' Hello World ! ' we 'll be launching a special project related to this near the weekend . Watch this space ! <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:49 am CST ) As is usual on Mondays , only one site was added to Trekseek yesterday , and I added that one myself so that I could at least do this update : - ) . Take a look at the new site : <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:34 am CST ) Well , the official news is finally out . As many people already thought , Raven Software has just announced it is developing a ' Star Trek : Voyager ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in about 30 minutes , so you 'll be able to read detailed news about the actual game then . <p> However , as Saleel and I already strongly suspected this would be happening , we 've been working on a special project related to this . Unfortunately I ca n't tell you exactly what it is , but I can promise you it will be something completely new for the world of online Trek , and it 'll greatly enhance TrekToday . Hopefully we 'll be able to get it up next weekend - we 're really excited about it , and I 'm absolutely sure you 'll all love it , too ! <p> Monday March 8 , 1999 <p> Stanley Kubrick Passes Away at 70Christian ( 1:38 pm CST ) This is n't really Star Trek related , and presumably everyone has heard about it already , but yesterday morning Stanley Kubrick died at the age of 70 . Kubrick was one of the world 's most famous directors , having directed ' The Clockwork Orange . ' For me , he was one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - A Space Odyssey , ' still one of the best SF movies ever made . Gary Lockwood , who played Gary Mitchell on the Original Series , actually had a major role in 2001 , so in a way this update is still Trek-related . In any case , I will miss him . The world has just lost a modern genius . <p> New Sev Trek Cartoon OnlineChristian ( 1:25 pm CST ) Major embarrasment prevailed in the Trekzone Headquarters last week when I realized that I had n't actually put up the most recent cartoon , but had instead gone with the cartoon of the week before . Thanks go out to Steven Hall for telling me about this - otherwise I might have put up the wrong cartoon again ! Anyways , without further ado : <p> Unreliable Rumours DepartmentChristian ( 1:17 pm CST ) Thanks to the Trekzone Network 's own Saleel Majeed , here is this week 's Star Trek teletext page from British stations Sky One and Channel 5 : <p> As usual , the only goal of this teletext page is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why all the headlines are , erm , ' slightly exaggerated . ' Most of these news items already made it to the net , in a more understated form , and the news items that are completely new I would n't believe at all until confirmation appears somewhere else . <p> Also , teletext page 193 , which deals with general science-fiction , has a healdine ' Top Star Trek Actor For X-Files Role ' - I do n't know who they mean with this , but I 'll let you know if I hear something more about this . <p> Warhead The Malon return again . An away team consisting of Neelix , Chakotay and Torres have to divert a Malon freighter in to a star before it spills it 's waste . The main Malon in this episode is named Dremck . ( Maybe he 's the cousin of Emck from " Night " . ) Not to be confused with Juggernaut , which seems to have a similar plot . <p> Season Finale A cliffhanger that starts filming Wednesday , March 10 . Rumored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right ! On Thursday , February 18th , our own Josh Clark was back in uniform , back on the set and back to playing Lt. Joe Carey ! At present , the return was just for this episode , but , hey , it 's a start ! <p> The Star Trek Universe , which is where I heard about this , adds to this that Clark 's episode *might* be ' Relativity , ' but this is n't certain yet . <p> New ' Radio Trek ' AvailableChristian ( 12:41 pm CST ) The people at the German Star Trek Index have just put up the second edition of their Internet radio show , ' Radio Trek . ' The latest edition of their two-weekly ' Opinions ' show just got online , talking about German television station Sat.1 's plan to cancel Voyager . You can listen to the show by clicking here . <p> Section 31 Changes ServersChristian ( 12:25 pm CST ) Regular visitors of Section 31 , the Star Trek multimedia and news site , may have noticed that the site . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened - their previous hosting company got into financial difficulties , and Section 31 decided to move to a different server . At the moment , the move is still being completed , but Section 31 has some exciting news of what is ahead : <p> New Forum - We were trying to get this going on our previous server , but it just was n't going to happen anytime soon with Advance . We expect a much better response from Burlee . <p> More Multimedia - We are no longer limited to 100 MB of space ! This is great news for you the site visitors . We are planning to add more sounds , pictures , desktop themes , screensavers , wallpaper art , fan art , and last but certainly not least , video clips . <p> Star Wars - We have been debating for same time as to whether or not to open a fully devoted Star Wars site , similar to the Trek portion of Section 31 . It is unlikely at this time due to time and resources . Not to mention there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there who have received plugs from E ! , Cinescape , and ET to name a few . Expect the latest multimedia video clips from the new prequels and occasional news tidbits for now . <p> Scarlett Pomers Wins Young Artist AwardsChristian ( 12:03 pm CST ) The Official Scarlett Pomers Homepage is reporting that Scarlett Pomers ( Naomi Wildman ) has recently won two Young Artists awards . Scarlett received the ' Best Performance in a Drama Series , Supporting Young Actress , ' award for her role on Voyager , and together with her co-stars she also won the ' Best Performance in a Feature Film , Young Ensamble ' award for her role in ' Slappy and the Stinkers . ' <p> She might actually soon be receiving even more awards , as the official homepage also reports Scarlett will soon be making a guest appearance on the UPN drama show ' Seven Days , ' which airs on Wednesdays just before Voyager . More news on all of this , including the address you can write to to congratulate Scarlett , can be found by going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wladimir Weltman to the Brazilian Sci-Fi News Magazine Insurrection Special Patrick Stewart has some interesting news . <p> " Brent Spiner and I have a very simple idea for plot of the next movie . It is a good idea . I can describe it to you in three sentences . Rick Berman actually knows about it " . <p> Unfortunately the update does not provide us with more detailed information on the plot idea . Presumably , though , it 's the same idea Patrick Stewart coined a few months ago , in which he suggested ' Star Trek X ' could be a direct follow-up to ' Insurrection , ' in which he would like to explore the corruption at the heart of the Federation : <p> Look at Anthony Zerbe 's character and how he 's been corrupted . And Picard 's act of conscience is stated clearly in his last line where he says he has 300 odd days of leave , but before that he has to go back and deal with this rot in the Federation . Zerbe 's character says that these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous than he 's imagined . With all that in mind , I think it could be very exciting to revisit this in the next movie . " <p> Patrick Stewart 's full idea can be found in this article at Planet Riker , but please do keep in mind that all of this certainly is n't final yet - none of it will probably make the final movie . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:51 am CST ) Sci-Fi Channel is showing the second-season TOS episode ' Return to Tomorrow ' tonight at 7:30pm Eastern Time , with a rerun at 11:30pm . <p> -In the UK , Sky One will be showing Voyager 's ' Meld ' at 5:00pm GMT . Later on , at 8:00pm , they 're showing a new DS9 episode - the sixth-season ' His Way .

From now on , I 'll be getting the episode listings directly from the Sky web site , hopefully that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:48 am CST ) Probably because our servers were down for nearly half of the day yesterday , only two sites were added to Trekseek.com yesterday , still bringing us to a respectable 823 sites . Take a look at the two new sites that were added to Trekseek yesterday : <p> -As I mentioned in yesterday 's update , the Starfleet Academy Tournament is an upcoming Starfleet Academy Tournament that is being sponsored by Interplay and Kali . Rules and details on how to appply can be found on this site . -'Star Trek vs Star Wars ' is , erm , a Star Trek and Star Wars Site with many downloads and lots of information . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:42 am CST ) Yesterday , while the sites were down , I figured it might be a nice idea to submit the site for some awards . After all , would n't it be great if we could display a few extra awards on the page ? This morning , I unsuspectingly checked my mail , and discovered we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great - we even became site of the week/month for a few sites ! Normally I 'd list the awards here on the main page right after receiving them , but in this case there are simply too many awards to do that - not that I 'm complaining , of course : - ) ! <p> To make sure that you 'd still be able to see the awards , we put up an awards page listing all our awards . Check them out , and then go visit the award sites . Saleel and I would like to thank everyone who presented us with an award , we truly love it . <p> Sunday March 7 , 1999 <p> New Trek ReviewChristian ( 12:54 pm CST ) Jim Wright at Delta Blues has posted another review of Voyager 's ' Course : Oblivion .

Could you ever foresee a time when it would end ? <p> A I ca n't imagine they 're going to let this franchise end with Voyager after 30 years . Come on . Come on ! laughing If for no other reason than it 's an absolute cash cow . That 's a very crass way of putting it but this franchise is not going to just die . And that 's OK as long as they take care to maintain quality , but if they 're just going to do spin-off after spin-off and not care who 's writing it or creating it or making sure the quality stays up there then , no , they 're not doing anybody any favors , the fans included . But I ca n't imagine they 'll do that . <p> ... <p> Q What does he Jeri Ryan 's son - TT think of the characters on Star Trek ? <p> A He 's completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little scary . He knows who 's a Borg , who 's a Ferengi . His teachers at preschool were a little disconcerted for the first couple of days until they realized I was on Star Trek They thought he was a little weird , because he was talking about all these aliens he knows . <p> A lot more answers , dealing with everything from sitcoms to conventions , can be found in the full article . <p> Trekweb Chat ReminderChristian ( 11:11 am CST ) This Tuesday , Trekweb will be hosting two Star Trek celebrity chats . At 4:00pm PST , Trekweb will be welcoming composer Jay Chattaway , who has been scoring Trek episodes for years now . Advance questions can now be submitted by going here . <p> An hour later , at 5:00pm PST , Trekweb is hoping to finally host their ' The 34th Rule ' chat . This chat has been postponed twice already , but hopefully this time all three authors of the novel will be able to make it . To submit questions to Armin Shimerman ( Quark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can go here . <p> Participating in the chats should be easy : <p> You can access the chat using the JAVA chat applet if you are using a JAVA capable browser . If not , you can use an IRC-based chat program , such as MIRC to access the appropriate chat server and channel . <p> -Click Here for the JAVA version -Or in a chat program connect to irc.webmaster.com , irc2.webmaster.com , or **26;859;TOOLONG and join channel #TrekWeb.COM . <p> Well , now the full ship list is known ( for the major empires anyway ) . There are similar ships in each empire . For instance , all empires have a Colony Ship ( the Klingons is armed however ) , but there are emprie specific functions . Teh only Warbird is the Romulan D'Deridex class . The Federation have a Science Vessel , no one else does , but the Ferengi have Raiders , for their trade route prowess . <p> All the empires have 7 models , 8 ships ( except for the Federation with 8 models , 9 ships ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be changed to a Troop transport for example , although they look similar . <p> The update then goes on to provide info the ships of the minor empires ( such as the Bajorans or the Ktarians ) , and the starbases of the various empires . Then the update goes on to mention that it 'll soon be a lot easier to access information on the game , as the ' BotF Database ' project is nearing completion ! The first early alpha version has just been finished , and a few screenshots of this unique program can also be found at FedCom . <p> Lastly , FedCom has just put up scans of a new preview that appeared in the German gaming magazine PC Action , and the ' page-shots ' plus some specific screenshots can be found at the site . In case you 're disappointed about the somewhat lower quality about the screenshots , you should probably direct your complaints to me , as I was actually the one who provided Paul with the scans . Take a look at FedCom to see how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Starfleet Command , Interplay 's latest Star Trek strategy game , is aimed directly at you . Based on Amarillo Design Bureau 's ridiculously detailed board game Star Fleet Battles , Starfleet Command puts you in command of a star fleet task force of up to six ships--you 'll manage every vessel imaginable , down to the smallest frigate . But not to worry : the game is n't some sleepy turn-based affair . Prepare to command countless ships in highly tactical real-time battles . Do n't ask us ; we do n't know why they trust you with all that equipment . <p> The preview then goes on to provide us with a bit of info on the races you can play as , and talks about the game 's graphics : <p> The game is played on a 2D map , but each ship is a true 3D object , which can be rotated 360 degrees and inspected up close . Every ship is painstakingly detailed , sporting unique markings . For instance , zoom in on a Federation starship and you 'll notice a NCC-1701A on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about lackluster special effects have been quelled . The game 's real-time lighting during explosions is out of this world . <p> Of course , more on this can be found in the full preview , including some screenshots , info on how your career will progress in the game , and even an interview with lead designer Erik Bethke ! The 16-minute interview can be accessed directly by clicking here , which will take you to ' CNET Radio .

Tomorrow , they 're showing the DS9 4th-season episode ' Sons of Mogh ' at 4:00pm , and the 2nd-season Voyager episode ' Dreadnaught ' at 5:00pm . Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> -Also in the UK , the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 6:00pm GMT they 're showing ' Year of Hell , Part Two , ' while at 6:45pm they 're showing ' Random Thoughts . ' <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 12:19 pm CST ) Fortunately Trekseek.com just got back online , so I can now bring you today 's ' New at Trekseek.com . ' I also got confirmation that , indeed , all the mails that were sent to us while the sites were down , did not get through , so if you sent us a mail , please re-send it . <p> Anyways , yesterday was the most popular day for Trekseek ever . We had twice as many hits as we usually get , and also twice as many site submissions . I do n't have a specific explanation for this sudden surge in popularity , but I sure hope we will be able to maintain this . The fact that we 've now got 821 sites in our database should certainly help with that - take a look at some of the 14 new sites that were added yesterday : <p> -The Trek Gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trekzone Network , so that site was down today as well . The Trek Gaming Alliance ( or TGA for short ) is a new Star Trek gaming site . In the comming months it will offer everything a trek gamer could want in a web site . -The new owner of the Trek Portal has re-opened the site , a few weeks after the previous webmaster ( Leonard Schuurmans at Warp 11 ) was forced to shut it down . The intention of this site is to make it your Star Trek portal to the WWW. -The Official Tim Russ Homepage is the official page for Tim Russ ( Tuvok ) , offering information on his various activities . <p> To see all the other new sites that were added yesterday , take a look at the full listing . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:14 am CST ) I 've got some good news , and I 've got some bad news . The good news is that , as you see , TrekToday survived the server re-location . The site was down for about two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bad news is that Trekseek and Trekzone still are n't up at the moment - they 're located on another server , and presumably something went wrong as the servers were being moved . <p> This means that today 's edition of ' New at Trekseek.com ' wo n't be making an appearance until Trekseek actually is up again - which is a pity , as we had no less than 14 site submissions yesterday . Another unfortunate consequence is that , if you send mail to our @trekzone.net-addresses , we wo n't be receiving it right now . Hopefully the mail will simply be stored until the sites get back up , but if you want to reach us right now , you can contact me at christian@trektoday.com and Saleel at saleel@trektoday.com . Meanwhile , our apologies for all of this ; hopefully the sites are back up soon . <p> update 19:48 CET / 12:48pm CST - Trekseek &amp; Trekzone are back up now , but unfortunately all our mail was lost . Please resend any mails you sent to us while the sites were down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> Star Trek : The Special Edition will air it 's final ninety minute episode on Thursday , March 25th . Beginning March 29th , the series will be cut to sixty minutes with almost all commentary being eliminated . Only the digitally remastered episodes themselves will still be shown . The show itself will also move and appear every evening at 7:00pm and 11:00pm ( ET ) Monday through Thursday , with a new Friday night lineup taking effect on March 19th that will eliminate the show altogether . The above comes after poor ratings and a recent change in the upper management of the Sci-Fi Channel . <p> This looks even more serious - especially the fact that TOS will be completely gone on friday evenings . I still urge you all to send a mail to the Sci-Fi Channel 's Programming Department , though I 'm not sure if that would have any effect at all anymore . In any case , major thanks go out to Fred Shedian at the Alliance Online News Network for submitting this news to us . <p> New Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cynics Corner has just uploaded his reviews of Voyager 's ' Course : Oblivion ' and DS9 's ' Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges . ' He 's mildly positive about Voyager 's latest offering , awarding it a 7,7 . His reasons for that can be found in the actual review . The Cynic liked DS9 's latest episode a lot more , though , awarding it a 9.0 . Check out the DS9 review here . <p> -Sorry for not reporting this earlier , but Jim Wright at Delta Blues has posted a temporary review of ' Course : Oblivion . ' Why temporary ? Well , he had to go out of town this weekend so he did n't have time to write a detailed synopsis . Instead , he posted this preliminary review of the episode which includes a rough synopsis and analysis . Go read it now , and then return later for the full review ! <p> Voyager Returns To Sat.1 In MayChristian ( 12:42 pm CST ) Good news for German Voyager fans ! As you may know , the Voyager episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the last one for a certain period of time . A few weeks ago , Sat.1 announced that they would n't be showing any more new Voyager episodes on friday night , as the series did n't achieve high enough ratings . Of course , German fans immediately protested and wanted to know more about this , as can be read in this ( German ) article on the German Star Trek Index . <p> However , today the German Star Trek Index posted the announcement that Voyager would already be returning to Sat.1 in May ! More news on this is n't yet available , but of course we 'll keep you informed when more news arrives . <p> Richard Kiley , DS9 Guest Star , Dies At 76Christian ( 11:45 am CST ) Richard Kiley , who was Broadway 's original ' Man of La Mancha ' and had great success in dozens of other roles in movies and television , recently passed away at the age of 76 . Star Trek viewers may remember him from his performance as ' Seyetik ' in the second-season DS9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for playing Don Quixote in the 1965 musical ' Man of La Mancha . ' In case you 're interested , this report at CNN provides some more details about Richard Kiley 's life . Thanks go out to Treknews for pointing me to this . <p> Daily Sci-Fi Examines Next Week 's Sci-FiChristian ( 11:26 am CST ) The Den 's Daily Sci-Fi has put up its look at next week 's Sci-Fi television shows . Unfortunately , as the sweeps month is over , both Voyager and DS9 are repeats , but if you missed them first time around the feature may still be interesting for you . DS9 's ' Chrysalis ' and Voyager 's ' Extreme Risk ' are both given a short description , and you can download the teasers for the episodes . Also , the episode takes a look at next week 's ' Earth : Final Conflict ' episode , which *is* a new one . You can find the full article here . <p> Robert Beltran Chat TranscriptChristian ( 11:11 am CST ) The Continuum has just posted the transcript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chat was hosted by Guy Vardaman , Senior Producer for the Star Trek Continuum . Take a look at a few snippets from the transcript : <p> Linda asks : Do you think the show is going in the right direction ? <p> Robert Beltran : When I find out what that direction is , I will tell you . Let me expand on that ... I do n't see the obvious advantage of going back to the Alpha Quadrant . We 're still going to be dealing with aliens , just with different noses . <p> ... <p> Peter Northwood asks : In 5 single words , how would you describe Chakotay AND yourself ( I mean 5 for each ! ! ) ? <p> Homosexual ? That would certainly be a ground-breaking development for Voyager , but it 's also the first I 've heard of it . Either I missed a few episodes , or Beltran is joking . This last option is made all the more likely by the following answer , where it looks as if Beltran used the secondary meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above did n't make you want to read the full transcript , I do n't know what would . More answers can be found in the full transcript . <p> TNG RPG Author Looks At Gaming IndustryChristian ( 10:59 am CST ) Kenneth Hite , author of Last Unicorn'sStar Trek : The Next Generation RPG , has just written a column for Mania Magazine looking back at how ( role-playing ) game companies did in 1998 . Unfortunately for fans of ' adventure gaming , ' the size of the market shrunk from $300 million in 1997 to $260 million in 1998 , mostly due to the fact that a third of the retail outlets stopped selling RPGs . <p> The article compares the market shares of the big RPG companies , and TNG RPG pubisher Last Unicorn occupies the seventh spot , with a market share of less than 5 % . The top-5 is filled with heavyweights such as TSR ( Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons ) and FASA ( the company that published a Trek RPG years ago ) . However , Kenneth Hite is hopeful that Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be releasing both DS9 and TOS game books in the summer . Take a look at the full column for more . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:36 am CST ) -In the UK , Sky One started showing the 4th-season DS9 episode ' Crossfire ' at 4:00pm GMT - 30 minutes ago . I never seem to be on time for that during the weekend : - ( . However , at 5:00pm they 're showing the 2nd-season Voyager episode ' Treshold , ' so you may still be able to catch that . Tomorrow , Sky One is showing DS9 's ' Return To Grace ' at 4:00pm and Voyager 's ' Meld ' at 5:00pm . Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> -Here in the Netherlands , the AVRO is showing a new Voyager episode tonight at 18:38 CET , I *think* it 's ' Concerning Flight , ' but I 'm not completely sure about that . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:20 am CST ) Did I say anything about submission figures going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing us to a total of 810 Star Trek links . Check out some of those new sites : <p> - The Nicole DeBoer Appreciation Page is dedicated to Nicole Deboer and her role as Ezri Dax on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , as well as her many other TV and movie roles . -Explore the decks of the U.S.S. Monarch , learn how to code for the Staship Creator and generally have a nice time . -'Kamar Sutra : A Twisted Tribute to Elim Garak ' is n't actually a new site , but it is the site whose Trekseek listing has changed the most . The most recent change is that Kamar Sutra has just moved to its own domain name at http : //www.elimgarak.com/ , while the site still offers you a ton of images plus caption galleries , Cardassian symbols , stories and love letters , monthly survey , and the Panache ! website award . <p> As usual , you can go here to see all the other new sites that were added to Trekseek yesterday . <p> Hello World ! Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yesterday our sites would not be accessible at some point this morning , as our hosting company would be moving its servers ? Well , they postponed the server move tomorrow morning , as they still needed some extra time to test out their connection to the Internet . This new time should be final , so both Trekseek and TrekToday will go down sometime tomorrow between 2:00am and 7:00am CST . <p> The sites should n't be down for more than an hour , so if you get online tomorrow and are n't able to access the sites , just try an hour later . This server move will also mean that we wo n't be able to receive during the time the sites are offline , at least not via our @trekzone.net addresses . If you want to send any of us mail , it might be a good idea not to do that between 2:00am and 7:00am CST . Let 's hope we survive it all : - ) . <p> I am a psychology and informatics lecturer at Nottingham Trent University , UK . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek fans and the extent of their ( your ! ) dedication and committment . This is for his final year dissertation . He would like your help .

Let 's show them we Trekkers are very nice and helpful people : - ) ! <p> As is probably clear from the above cartoon , this week 's competition deals with ' Quirk ' as he is being bombarded with Trubbles : <p> Quirk and Trubbles ! Here 's a one of the more popular Trekkie scenes , as evidence by the fact that the idea has been suggested about half a dozen times over the last year ! <p> As usual , Sev Trek readers can submit their own punchlines , and the best punchline will be used next week in the actual cartoon . You can submit your ideas here , while the funniest suggestions will be posted here . <p> Star Trekkies and music fans across the galaxies , take note : Capt . James T. Kirk and recording artist Ben Folds have teamed up to beam up " Fear of Pop . " Music is a place where the real-life Kirk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Folds . " He 'd written me a letter and I did n't recognize the name until my children clapped and said , ' You 've got to do this , ' " Shatner told CNN . <p> The report also talks about Shatner 's career in music , which started in 1968 when he released the , erm , slightly unusual album ' The Transformed Man . ' However , according to Shatner most people did n't really understand what the album was about : <p> Shatner 's album , in which he ventured into the realm of music and poetry , has been mocked by late-night talk show hosts and disc jockeys over the years . That 's because the prose that preceded the melodramatic voice-overs that went with the songs was always overlooked , Shatner told CNN . " When it got radio play , they did n't want a six-minute cut , they wanted a three-minute cut , so they chose the song , " Shatner explained . " I guess the disc jockey thought I was trying to sing or something so ... they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was something , there was a concept behind it . " <p> The rest of the report has Ben Folds talking about how he loved ' The Transformed Man ' when it first came out , and also includes a short audio clip from the new CD . Go take a look here . <p> " Course : Oblivion " slightly increased over " The Disease " in the overnights , capping sweeps with a 5.1/7 rating , up 4% over last week 's 4.9/7 . Unfortunately , that 's quite a bit off from the first two sweeps weeks , and should probably drag the entire month below last year 's February mark , marring Voyager 's shot at a year-to-year increase . <p> ... <p> This episode will most certainly fall to its competition from last year , the two-hour " The Killing Game . " With its timeslot-damaged rating , " Oblivion " will probably destroy Voyager 's bid to increase over last year 's February sweeps mark as well . Again , my apologies for being late in informing you that " Course : Oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out when I get them . <p> The full report also takes a look at the reason behind Voyager 's disappointing ratings - ABC 's ' Monica Lewinsky ' interview . Just think - if it were n't for Bill Clinton and his Oval Office escapades , Voyager might have actually had higher ratings . Why did n't they decide to impeach him four years ago : - ) ? <p> Just published from Pocket Books , the $20 paperback serves up amusing morsels of Trek ' ' history as they relate to food , as well as genuine recipes passed down by the likes of Kate Mulgrew , Leonard Nimoy , Jonathan Frakes and Alexander Siddig . <p> The cookbook came about from my going to so many conventions and having so many people ask me , When are you going to write a cookbook ? ' ' ' Phillips says by telephone from his home in Los Angeles . I thought , Gee , maybe I should write one . ' <p> But it was n't until Bill Birnes , who 's the co-writer with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1997 ) and The Riverman ' ( Pocket Books , 1995 ) , called and suggested we do it that it actually became a reality . I looked through my notes , and I 'd saved a lot of little funny ideas , so Bill and I got together and it took us about a year to do . <p> The rest of the column has Phillips talking about his cookbook , his experiences with his character ' Neelix ' on Voyager , and also provides some other Trek news . You can find the column by going here and scrolling down . <p> A strong beginning . An good ' n ' twisty plot-turn . Can we have a nice , satisfying follow-through , please ? Sorry , friends , this episode is like trying to eat a bag of peanut butter M&amp;Ms as if it were a meal -- the first half of the bag is quite tasty , but , by the time you reach the end , you 're unsatisfied , malnourished and just a little bit nauseated . Pity . <p> In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of five , but you can read the full review here , in case you want to know more . Three stars is also what DS9 's latest offering scores : <p> This one falls just short of great ... and I must admit , I 'm not sure why . As a critic , I know I am supposed to be all-seeing and all-knowing , but I 'm no Bashir-esque , genetically-enhanced superhuman . I will , however , take a guess , thereby increasing my chances of always being right , and likewise , my chances of someday being an omnipotent , ever-correct , worldly-wise and altogether awesome entity with my own infomercial . <p> The full review of ' Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges ' can be found by going here . <p> Ordover Q&amp;A UpdatedChristian ( 12:26 pm CST ) John Ordover , editor at Pocket Books , has answered some extra questions on his Q&amp;A forum . First up , there 's the news that the Upcoming Titles page has been updated to include the covers of some up the upcoming books . Related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Diane Muldaur ( Pulaski ) would get payed for having her likeness used on the cover of one of these books : <p> I know that we do n't pay for the use of Trek character 's likenesses . I do n't know the exact details of each actor 's contract , but in general in recent years everyone signs a contract that gives Paramount the rights to their likeness in a Star Trek context . It was different in the TOS days , but again , that not something I deal with . <p> In the rest of his Q&amp;A update , Ordover answers some other questions about upcoming books , including the ' Double Helix ' series and the ' Vulcan 's Heart ' novel . On top of all this , there 's now also a special page up for the upcoming ' Strange New Worlds ' contest , which includes the list of winners , the official rules and a FAQ . One of the things mentioned in this FAQ is especially interesting for non-Americans like me : <p> We will be talking to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course , I realize the chance of there actually being a special contest here in the Netherlands is practically non-existent , but at least British and Australian Trek fans will be able to take part in such a contest .

George III and Eric A. Stillwell , which was supposed to have taken place has been yesterday , has been postponed again . In the chat , there would have been the opportunity to ask questions to the three authors of the new DS9 novel ' The 34th Rule , ' but unfortunately Armin Shimerman had to attend an afternoon shoot for ' Buffy : The Vampire Slayer ' yesterday , and could n't make it in time . <p> The chat will now be taking place next Tuesday , the 9th of March , at 5:00pm PST .

Advance questions for this chat can be submitted here . <p> Mania Reviews ' Inter Arma Enim ... ' Christian ( 11:49 am CST ) AnotherUniverse.com 's Mania Magazine has published its review of DS9 's ' Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges , ' the episode in which Bashir starts working for Section 31 . One of the things reviewer Michelle Erica Green did n't like about the episode was the way it betrayed most of Star Trek 's history : <p> I am deeply ambivalent about the idea of Starfleet being associated with something like Section 31 . It goes against everything the Star Trek myth has always stood for - cooperation , honesty , high ideals . Sure , Kirk had his share of Evil Admirals , but they were always shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sloan have become Deep Space Nine 's equivalent of the Syndicate and Cancer Man , and even though there is a war arc going on , I just do n't think it adds anything to the series . At best , it provides the pretext for a couple of spy shows , but at worst it turns the franchise into something profoundly different - something dark and bitter , something perhaps more realistic but hardly distinguishable from The X-Files or Babylon 5 or Earth : Final Conflict or any other sci-fi series centering on a war between human(oid)s and aliens . It takes away what has made Star Trek original and fascinating for decades , all for a cheaply derivative storyline . <p> Although I have n't yet been able to see any Section 31 episodes myself , I do find myself strongly agreeing with this . The Federation should not have its own Obsidian Order - they 're the good guys , after all . In any case , the full review , which contains a detailed synopsis of the episode and the rest of Michelle Erica Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eon Interviews Nicole DeBoerChristian ( 11:16 am CST ) In this week 's issue of Eon Magazine ( issue 14.0 ) , there 's an interview with Nicole DeBoer ( Ezri Dax ) , entitled ' Dax All Folks . ' In the article , written by Christopher Allan Smith , DeBoer talks about the upcoming end of DS9 : <p> Cast last fall as Ezri Dax on STAR TREK : DEEP SPACE NINE , DeBoer landed a plum role on the premier show of science fiction 's premiere franchise just as the crew , cast , and studio was preparing DS9 for its last season . <p> " I 'm going to be sad at the end , I know it , " says DeBoer . " I can already tell the other cast , the crew sometimes someone will say it 's near the end and someone else will say , ' Do n't start , do n't start . I do n't want to talk about it right now because I 'll cry . ' I 'm sure it 's harder on them because it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be upset because I really bonded with everybody . " <p> The rest of the ( rather long ) article talks about DeBoer 's experiences on the show , and also has DS9 writers Ron D. Moore and Ira Steven Behr talking about how much they like the character . Another interesting bit is where DeBoer talks about the evolution of her character : <p> " In the beginning they wanted her to be so different from Jadzia , " DeBoer explains . " They wanted her to be much more youthful and much more unsure of herself . Then we realized , well , I watched a couple of the episodes that came out and thought ' That was fun and everything and I like doing the humor and confusion of who she is , but you can only do that for so long . ' I thought I hope they 're going to start having her be more together and mature a bit . I came into work the other day , and Ira and Hans said the same thing to me . I thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The full article features even more wise words from Nicole DeBoer , and even has several nice pictures of DeBoer and her fellow cast members . Go check it out ! <p> Eon Reviews ' Music Of Trek'Christian ( 11:02 am CST ) Major surprise for me here - this week 's issue of Eon Magazine reviews a new book by Jeff Bond called ' The Music Of Star Trek . ' I did n't even know such a book existed ! The book 's been published by the ' Lone Eagle Publishing Company , ' and will set you back $17.95 . However , according to Eon , this is well worth it : <p> The best thing about Jeff Bond 's THE MUSIC OF STAR TREK is , in an area of publishing ( books on STAR TREK ) where every conceivable inch of territory has been documented in every conceivable way , he 's pulled off no small feat . He 's written a clear , readable and exhaustively researched book on an aspect of TREK almost no one has touched . Given the fame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what musical theme in pop culture ?

Are they maybe taking a short holiday ? <p> -In the UK , Sky One is showing the second-season Voyager episode ' Alliances ' at 5:00pm GMT , with a rerun at 11:30pm .

Saratoga has information about Voyager , DS9 , and Next Generation . It also has a games page and a book page . <p> In case you still feel the urgent need to look at some new sites , why not explore the listing of last week 's new sites ? <p> Hello World ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've survived my ISP 's server move - they moved so quickly I never even noticed it ! However , server transport problems are n't over yet , as tomorrow morning our host will be moving its servers , causing all the sites in the Trekzone Network to be down for about an hour or so . If all goes as planned , they will be moving all webservers and network equipment between the hours of 2:00 am and 7:00 am CST , one server at a time .

Apparently , Foundation Imaging , one of the companies responsible for many of Voyager 's computer-generated special effects , has secured the rights to produce the new ' Starship Troopers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation proved itself for Voyager fans was the creation of ' Species 8472 , ' and presumably it 's work such as this that allowed them to obtain the license . Take a look at part of the Daily Sci-Fi 's report : <p> While some of you were n't pleased about the idea of a Starship Troopers computer-animated series , it 's in progress , and you 're going to like it , dammit ! Since the computer animation industry 's been growing in leaps and bounds , a lot of competitors were going for the license , including Mainframe Entertainment ( Beast Wars , War Planets ) , but it seems a few relative unknowns will be producing the series : Foundation Imaging and Flat Earth . Well , actually , pseudo-unknowns . Foundation Imaging did work for Babylon 5 and is the company responsible for a lot of Voyager 's computer animated effects and creatures ( including Species 8472 ) and Flat Earth does work for Hercules and Xena . <p> The full report goes on to provide some info on the new television series , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was a big night for ABC that got around 33.0 for its Lewinsky interview from 9 to 11 , so Voyagers rating was not as good as you could have hoped . Voyager got a 5.1/7 , that 's up 0.3 from last weeks episode . <p> Voyagers was 5th in its hour along with WBs " Charmed " . But Voyager was closs to CBS 's " 60 Minutes II " that only got a 5.5/8 . ( Because of the Lewinsky interview " <p> My apologies for the confusion , but as I just realized , February sweeps are not over yet . In fact , the last night is tonight , counting the performance of " Course : Oblivion . " Unfortunately , this means that Voyager now has the opportunity to drop its increase over last year , an increase I have already posted in error . Those pages have been updated and I 'll keep you posted as to " Course : Oblivion " ' s performance , which now carries the burden of holding the February average to date . <p> Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still be found here , and let 's all hope yesterday 's ' Course : Oblivion ' did well . <p> On top of that , the Continuum has also just announced two new chats with members of the Deep Space Nine production crew : <p> Gary Hutzel Thursday , March 11th , 1999 06:30 PM ( PT ) <p> Chat will Gary Hutzel ( Visual Effects Supervisor ST:DS9 ) about his role in creating out-of-this-world visual effects . <p> Steve Oster Thursday , March 25th , 1999 06:30 PM ( PT ) <p> Chat with Steve Oster ( Supervising Producer on ST:DS9 ) about what we can expect from the final months of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . <p> ' The 34th Rule ' Chat At TrekwebChristian ( 11:39 am CST ) Today , Trekweb is organising a chat with the three people behind the new DS9 novel ' The 34th Rule ' - Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) , David R.

' Something which also seems to be getting more and more normal is that reviewer Michelle Erica Green did n't like the episode : <p> The theme for " Course : Oblivion " could be described as : " Why are you people wasting your time on Voyager when you could be watching Barbara Walters ' interview with Monica Lewinsky ? " Seriously , I did not think ANYTHING , could make me want to hear one more word about that ... but fifteen minutes into Voyager I was thinking that the interview could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that the previews showed the entire crew dying was a pretty good indicator that we were in an alternate universe or at least on an alternate Voyager , and Tom 's being a lieutenant immediately indicated that it split off from the present series several months ago . Seven 's presence meant that it could n't have been more than two years ago , however , even if she was wearing an anachronistic red catsuit which she did n't have back then . The acting was quite fine , particularly Paris ' bitterness and grief over Torres , but who cares ? He 's right : this is n't the real crew . I did n't feel sorry for them , I felt relieved when they were finally all gone . At least I know that Janeway 's smashing the Prime Directive to leave clones in the Delta Quadrant wo n't have any lasting effects . <p> More of this analysis , plus a synopsis of the episode , can be found in the full review . <p> Voyager Remains Top-Rated UPN ShowChristian ( 10:57 am CST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the 20 top-rated Prime Time TV Programs for the week beginning Feb. 22 .

Obviously , that means they 're trying as hard as possible to print exciting news , but I would n't trust any of these headlines until they are confirmed elsewhere . Major thanks go out to the Trekzone Network 's own Saleel Majeed for providing these headlines . <p> Hear Ben Sisko SingChristian ( 11:14 am CST ) The Singularity has uploaded and audio clip of Vic Fontana and Benjamin Sisko singing ' The Best is Yet to Come !

Thanks go out to WebTrek for pointing me to this . <p> " The Disease " capped sweeps with a less-than-stellar outing , only mustering a 3.4 rating , 5 share , tying with " Counterpoint " as the second-lowest rated episode of the year . That rating is down 27% from last week 's " Dark Frontier " ( 4.7 ) and 19% from last year 's " Retrospect " ( 4.2 ) . <p> The timeslot competition was extraordinarily strong this week with CBS 's Grammy Awards earning a 16.6 , " Law and Order " getting a 9.9 , and Fox 's " The Nutty Professor " gathering an 8.3 . Voyager was squashed by all of the above , finishing 6th just behind the equally damaged " Charmed , " which managed a 3.5 . <p> However , the full report also has some positive news , as the entire month of February ended up being the highest-rated sweeps month since last season 's November , which also marks the first time in the post-TNG area that ratings actually increased since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full report for more . <p> Happy Birthday James Doohan ! Christian ( 10:36 am CST ) Today is the 69th birthday of James Doohan , best known as ' Scotty ' in the Original Series . One of his special talents is his ability to ' do ' accents , which is also how he got the role on Star Trek . Later he also used this talent on the Animated Series , where he created the voices of some of the more bizarre series regulars . I 'd direct you to a dedicated fan site if I knew of one , but unfortunately none seem to exist . Still , a happy birthday to James Doohan from us here at the Trekzone Network ! <p> Today On TVChristian ( 10:29 am CST ) -In the US , UPN is showing a new Voyager episode at 9:00pm Eastern/ Pacific Time , a follow-up to last year 's ' Demon ' called ' Course : Oblivion .

' I 've been a fan of them for a long time , even longer than I 've been a Trek fan , and I still love all their CDs .

He provided some interesting info , including the news that there is actually a possibility Voyager might be returning to Earth in Season 6 : <p> According to Picardo there is talk of bringing Voyager home in season 6 , but nothing is for certain . He said Kate Mulgrew will not leave the show before her contract is completed , but season 7 is hardly etched in stone for her . Possibly that 's all the more reason to bring the ship home , so a reasonable replacement for Janeway could be found . <p> At the convention , Picardo also provided some info on the upcoming episode ' Someone To Watch Over Me ' : <p> Robert Picardo ( The Doctor ) stated that " Someone ... " was a Higgins/Eliza type story derived from independent ideas from both the actor and the producers . <p> The absence of Kes has left a void for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Seven has been used to fill that gap . This episode , where the Doctor helps Seven of Nine prepare for an upcoming first date , sees his character start to develop real feelings for Seven . One scene to look out for is a slow dance between the two characters . <p> Picardo says the episode 's ending is touching and one the fans will enjoy . <p> The full report also has some info on another upcoming episode in which ' a villain will tamper with his program , making the Docter the bad guy for a change , ' and the info that Picardo would very much like DeForest Kelley ( Leonard ' Bones ' McCoy , TOS ) to guest star on Voyager . Go take a look ! <p> Anyways , this article on Yahoo ! talks about a poll called ' Beyond Oscar ' , which will be launched sometime today at the Newsweek web site .

However , now that these new novels are selling so extremely well , maybe there is another chance for the series ... <p> In other Trek novel news , John Ordover just mentioned on his Q&amp;A page that he will be officially announcing Strange New Worlds III later today .

This month also sees the launch of a brand new column , ' Alien Point of View , ' by Claudia Roedel .

A genuine , bona fide , certified Alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the place where my Social Security Number should be ( I do n't have one ) : " Non-resident Alien .

We here at the Trekzone Network wish Dark Commander luck with the Trek Gaming Alliance , news on which we will of course be reporting as soon as we get it . <p> It 's time for our semi-annual roundup of TV between the covers . No - sorry , I do n't mean coverage of the sex lives of our favorite television characters , especially considering that many of our favorite television characters are on Star Trek and therefore only get to have sex when the Captain gives them permission , which is about once in a blue moon . But this is as good a time as any to take a look at guides to our favorite shows , and decide which books are worth our hard-earned money . <p> After a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek guides are also examined in detail . Let 's look at one of Mania 's recommendations : <p> If you want an innovative guide to Trek , however , the newly published Star Trek Cookbook by Ethan Phillips ( Voyager 's Neelix ) and William J. Birnes covers all four series and many of their stars as well . Want to know what to serve at a Klingon feast attended by Vulcans ( who are vegetarian ) and Bolians ( whose digestive systems differ radically from our own ) ? Would you know what beverages to serve Picard ( tea , Earl Grey , hot ) and Janeway ( coffee , black , VERY hot ) ? There are delectable photos of the characters in the kitchen , as well as some terrifying photos of the food ( even fake gagh can make one gag ) . If you 're interested in whipping up Quark 's drinks or Kate Mulgrew 's pork tenderloins , you must have this guide to cooking among the stars ... and the stars . <p> The full article also takes a look at books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future ' , and , of course , then provides us with the chance to actually buy these books .

Then an ensign disappears while testing the local water and Kirk orders the landing party back to the ship , which promptly begins to suffer from unexplained malfunctions . Kirk drinks a cup of coffee and abruptly disappears from the bridge . From his perspective , the Enterprise crewmembers have come to a standstill , and now Kirk can see the Scalosians , who move so quickly that the human eye can not perceive them . He learns from Deela that the people of Scalos have been rendered unable to reproduce with one another because of radiation poisoning , so they require aliens to propagate their species . But accelerating humans makes them susceptible to cell damage , and the missing ensign ages and dies very quickly after a minor wound . Wary of provoking the Scalosians , Kirk records a message for Spock and pretends to go along with Deela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scalosian water and joins Kirk in his accelerated state , and the two of them are able to force the aliens from the ship . McCoy has developed an antidote to the acceleration , so after repairing the ship , Spock is able to revert to the normal state to which the captain has already returned . <p> Analysis : " Wink of an Eye " is by no means the worst of the silly Evil Alien episodes of Star Trek 's third season , but to enjoy it requires the repression of all scientific thought and logic . There are only five Scalosians left , yet they continue to adhere to one-man , one-woman mating ( and presumably human-scale pregnancies ) rather than working on cloning technology , artificial wombs or other techniques that would enable them to utilize all the Enterprise crewmembers ' DNA combined with their own to repopulate Scalos . Their infertility issues stem from radiation from volcanoes , which somehow rendered nearly the entire population infertile except a handful of men and women who can reproduce but not with each other . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entirely separate - Deela tells Kirk that their way of reproducing has been going on for generations - there is still enough jealousy and anger that the vitally needed breeding stock gets damaged when a Scalosian has a temper tantrum . And let 's not even get started on the absurdity of the accelerated time scale , where people do not appear to move at all , yet Spock and McCoy have time to hear Kirk 's tape and develop an antidote to Scalosian water before Deela 's people can take control of the ship . <p> This episode is legendary for one scene : Kirk tugging his boots on after having sex with Deela . There is a persistent group of fans who insist that Kirk is n't nearly the intergalactic stud he thinks he is , that he did n't really seduce Lenore and Drusilla and Shahna and Kelinda and ... well , if you 've been reading these reviews you can keep your own count . In " Wink of an Eye , " however , the evidence is incontrovertible : they did it . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted before dumping her back on Scalos without bothering to check ... given that Ann Crispin wrote a series of novels in which Spock 's illegitimate son from one of his interstellar flings shows up , one can only imagine the miniseries if all of David Marcus ' potential half-siblings turned up . ) The sexual politics are notable in comparison to last week 's " Plato 's Stepchildren , " when Kirk had to be forced to kiss Uhura - a woman he respects and likes . With Deela , who introduces herself to him as " the enemy " and tells him that she plans to use his entire crew as breeding stock until they die , he is only too happy to make sweet distracting love . At the end of the episode , regarding an image of Deela , he appears to feel not violated but nostalgic . If you do n't mind my saying so ... ick . <p> What redeems the incident for me is that I rather do like Deela , even if I find her adherence to what she believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginative . She does n't particularly relish the idea of having to be unfaithful to the man she really wants , though she does it in the name of duty and begs him to allow her the dignity of liking the man she chooses to serve as a sperm donor . She 's the queen bee in the Scalosian hive , destined to bear children with the most promising drones ; being seductive is a job for her , like perpetually brushing her hair . On the one hand , she can be entirely cold-hearted and ruthless , calmly explaining how a young officer came to be a burned-out human shell , but on the other hand , she does n't have much more freedom than those she traps in her accelerated state . <p> It 's frustrating that Kirk does n't offer her any solution that might benefit the Scalosians as well as his crew , either while they control his ship or after he takes it back . Would McCoy 's antidote allow them to live in Kirk 's time frame , which would give them the option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them rebuild their society both genetically and socially ? Could n't he at least mention some of the birth technologies that might assist the Scalosians , who do n't seem to have been any more venal or imperialistic than humans until they became desperate to survive as a race ? <p> My favorite moment in this episode is a very small one , but it says a great deal about the command crew of the Enterprise . When Kirk , seeking a way to stop the Scalosians from putting his crew in suspended animation , spots Spock moving in the accelerated timeline , his first reaction is not concern or alarm that Spock might have been accelerated to be used as breeding stock like himself , but relief and happiness ; he grins . It is taken for granted that Spock is there to help , likely by his own choosing , and surely that means he and McCoy got Kirk 's message and are working on a way to restore things to normal . <p> " Wink of an Eye " chooses the superficial ending , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sexual encounter . It 's about the titillation of the crew being used as breeding stock rather than the crisis being suffered by the Scalosians and the desperation of their response . Deep thought is not called for - in fact , it must be discouraged , or we 'd have to wonder why Deela did n't notice McCoy starting to work on his antidote and stopping him before he managed a single test on the Scalosian water . Ultimately we 're left with a superficial Evil Alien of the Week story in which Kirk decides he ca n't trust people so unlike himself , even though he 's forgiven numerous other aliens for threatening his ship and crew , offering them assistance from Starfleet with less dire problems . I ca n't help but call the episode a disappointment .

Christian ( 2:09 pm CST ) If you enjoy getting in touch with other Star Trek fans , chances are you know about the Starfleet Communications Relay ( SFCR ) . This is probably the oldest set of Star Trek web forums on the net , having been around in one form or the other since 1995 .

However , in the in the summer of 1998 the forums came back online , after Charles Capps agreed to take over the forums . Charles Capps had previously been doing exactly the same for the Behaviour Group forums , which had to be closed down after the Behaviour Group 's server had been hacked .

We all anxiously awaited its re-opening , and finally , a few weeks ago , the forums re-opened . Trek fans all over the world rejoiced , and the posters busily started posting again . Once again , everything seemed fine , until saturday , when the CommRelay visitors were greeted by the following shock announcement posted by Charles Capps : <p> Jeri Ryan Starburst Pictures AvailableChristian ( 12:52 pm CST ) As you may know , the March issue of Starburst Magazine carries an interview with Jeri Ryan , in which she talks about her experiences on Voyager , and gives some info on ' Dark Frontier .

Computers phasers , tricorders , cortical stimulators , tractor beams , warp drive , impulse drive , transporter , anti grav , shuttles , runabouts and Defiance ( or is that Defiant . ) Life was straight forward in the sixties and the original Star Trek . The only regular alien had bad hair and pointed ears , to whom all was fascinating . A ship that could go really fast and a Scottish engineer who worked in what looked like a DIY warehouse/tool rack . Sickbay was a botempi organ and a couple a mattresses .

Bashir 's been assigned to go undercover and spy on the Romulans . Sisko wants Bashir to spy on Section 31 . What 's a genetically engineered doctor to do ? <p> The full preview takes a look at some other sci-fi shows , including Gene Roddenberry 's ' Earth : Final Conflict , ' and also provides us with two short teaser movies of the new Trek episodes . <p> Eon Reviews ' Dark Frontier'Christian ( 9:43 am CST ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be precise ) has a review of the Voyager episode no self-respecting reviewer can do without - last week 's telefilm ' Dark Frontier . ' Unfortunately , reviewer Jeff Bond was not as positive as a lot of the other reviewers , only awarding a ' B- ' to the episode : <p> Most of the script 's budget seems to have been expended on the Borg sets , which are obviously redresses of the VOYAGER 's twisty corridors . Foundation Imaging creates an impressive Borg shipyard with thousands of miles of zero-gravity elements , although even the tremendous scale created here never quite creates the sense of awe you 'd expect to get out of what is apparently the Borg " homeworld . " That may be because Foundation has created such a high standard of detail and scope for its VOYAGER shots that we 're all becoming a little bit jaded . At any rate , the human focus of DARK FRONTIER never catches hold because this story has already been told in earlier episodes that did a much better job of illustrating the horror of Borg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeri Ryan gives one of her flattest , least-nuanced performances here , and the direction of the movie by Cliff Bole and Terry Windell hardly approaches cinematic quality ( the second hour is particularly lifeless ) . There 's trouble afoot when VOYAGER ca n't even get a rise out of a Seven of Nine Borg movie . <p> Cinescape : I 'm sure the writers will be trying to tie up a lot of loose ends by the end of the season . Will there be any big revelations or changes for Quark ? <p> Shimerman : One of the disappointments for me on the show is there 's never been a really great character arc for Quark . He 's had lots of moments of fun and conniving and joy , but if you look at it there 's really nothing that needs to be tied up for him . Whether his business will continue or not after the last episode is something that I do n't think the show will tie up one way or another . We want to know what happens to the Emissary Sisko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Kira and Odo . We want to know what happens to Odo as far as the Founders are concerned . We want to know whether Dukat gets what he deserves , and the same thing can be said for Kai Winn . We want to know if Garak will ever be welcomed back to Cardassia . Many of our recurring characters have big arcs . But Quark , like an Everyman , has just passed through their lives and added a little spice every now and then . <p> Two more questions ( and their answers ) can be found in the full feature , though even that is just a preview of an article that is going to appear in a ' Cinescape Insider Special ' focusing on the last days of Deep Space Nine , on sale in April . Thanks go out to Warp 11 for pointing me to this . <p> New Birth Of The Federation InfoChristian ( 9:28 am CST ) Paul Weaver at FedCom has just posted a huge amount of new info on Microprose 's upcoming turn-based strategy game ' Birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed Paul with some new info on the game , including the full , unabridged list of all the ships in the game . Unfortunately , Paul has decided to give out this information in daily doses , so today there 's only the news of a Klingon Heavy Cruiser : <p> The Negh'Var class Vessel is designated a ' Heavy Cruiser ' , this is an understatement . Watch out though , a few small but manuverable ships could destroy one of these if you 're not careful . Due to their immense size these will be very expensive , and require a high technology . <p> At FedCom you 'll also be able to find a picture of this ship . In the rest of his mail , Jeff gave an explanation for the recent delay and lack of info on the game : <p> I know the marketing behind BotF has been a little lacking . I 'm sure you 've heard this before , but its true nonetheless : BotF was caught in the Hasbro transition . The UK marketing department underwent turnover and the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US marketing department suffered even higher turnover , and the people who stayed had to move from San Francisco to Boston . This caused a great deal of chaos and confusion in the marketing plan for all of our games , but BotF was particularly hard hit . Things are stabilizing now , and I expect to see better marketing moving forward . <p> Perhaps in order to reward us for the long wait , Jeff also sent along an exclusive screenshot of the game , taken while he was playing the Romulans : <p> This screenshot is from a game I was playing as the Romulans . As you can see I 've explored substantially , ecountered the Klingons and several minors . The view on the left and right show that I am currently building an outpost to secure my end of the wormhole . <p> Even more news on this can be found at FedCom , including an analysis of the screenshot and news of a new advert for the game . Go check it out ! <p> Sci-Fi Channel To Cancel Trek ? Christian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Jim ' at the Trekweb Message Board for this one . As you probably know , the SciFi Channel is currently running the ' Star Trek - Special Edition ' series for the second time . This Special Edition basically means that viewers get to see the full , uncut episodes in a digitally remastered version . Also , each episode is currently accompanied by comments from Leonard Nimoy . <p> Unfortunately , all that seems about to change . At the moment , each episode takes about 90 minutes to run , including Nimoy 's presentation and commercials . But , if you take a look at the Sci-Fi Channel 's Schedule Bot and take a look at Monday the 29th of March , you 'll see that only one hour is reserved for the episode of that day , ' Spectre of the Gun . ' All further episodes are limited to one hour as well , meaning that a lot of the episodes has been cut . In all probability , Leonard Nimoy 's commentary will be gone altogether , while about five minutes will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll come across the Star Trek Bulletin Board at the SciFi Channel , and some alarming posts were made there over the past few days . Take a look at a part of one of these messages , posted by ' WLM ' , a former employee of the SciFi Channel : <p> I too have heard from a friend at SFC that indeed , they are pulling the Special Edition . <p> This is due to low ratings . <p> ... <p> Unfortunately , the Special Edition is a project that got caught up in the cogs of the machine when SFC and its parent company , USA Networks were bought by Barry Diller . A number of new people were brought in and a number of people left in the upper management of SFC and unfortunately , the new folks have n't shared the enthusiasm that we of the old guard had for the project . I guess you can chalk it up to different tastes . <p> ... <p> As for the recent postings about the Special Edition on DVD appearing on DVD , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of the newly transfered masters of TOS . SFC owns the rights to all of the Special Edition material created for broadcast . Unless Paramount negotiated a deal with SFC and Shatner and Nimoy ( and paid them a whole heck of a lot of money ) it 's doubtful that the supplemental material will appear on the TOS DVDs . I could be wrong though , and I 'll do a little digging to see if it is true . <p> I have confirmed this , at least in terms of the Nimoy stuff . At present , there are no plans to include any of the Nimoy material on the TOS DVDs . This info is from a source who would know . <p> I have sent a mail to the Sci-Fi Channel 's US Programming Department , but so far I have n't yet received a response ( they 're probably not there during the weekend ) . In any case , this is very bad news for us Trek fans - once again the Original Series is cancelled due to low ratings . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few options open to you . First of all , there 's the aforementioned Bulletin Board , where you might find more news on this . Secondly , you could also send them a mail , asking them to re-consider their decision . Let 's hope they do . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 8:49 am CST ) -In the UK , Sky One is showing the fourth-season DS9 episode ' Homefront ' at 4:00pm GMT , followed an hour later by the 1st-season Voyager episode ' Persistence of Vision .

Christian ( 8:36 am CST ) You may be surprised at the early start today , but this evening I 'm going to see ' Insurrection ' for the second time , so I probably wo n't have time to update then . If I do n't manage to report all the news today , I 'll put in an extra update tomorrow morning to make sure I get in all the news . <p> Friday February 26 , 1999 <p> New York Convention Tickets On SaleChristian ( 12:54 pm CST ) Creation Entertainment has just announced that tickets for the Star Trek convention at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York are now on sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sunday the 28th of March and features appearances by Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) , Grace Lee Whitney ( Janice Rand ) , Roxann Dawson ( B'Elanna Torres ) and Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) .

Currently , the station is showing the fourth season of Voyager for the very first time , but after the episode ' Beute ' ( Prey ) they wo n't be showing any new episodes anymore , stopping right in the middle of the season . <p> According to Sat.1 's official reaction , the ' general public did not accept this sci-fi series . ... We are currently looking for an acceptable time slot . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' According to the article , it is not even clear yet if a new time slot will be found at all . Of course , this makes Sat.1 's recent promise that they 'd start showing season 5 in October even less likely . <p> My apologies in advance for any errors I made in my interpretation of the article - German is n't my native language . The full article ( in German ) can be found by clicking here . <p> The Trek Portal Shuts DownChristian ( 12:11 pm CST ) Unfortunately , after having been in operation for only two months , The Trek Portal has shut down . The Trek Portal was one of the few Star Trek portal sites , offering links to the most important Trek resources online . The Trek Portal was also one of the first sites ever linking to TREKSEEK.COM , something we liked rather a lot . Take a look at ( part of ) the announcement posted by Leonard Schuurmans : <p> It was nearly impossible for me to keep this site up-to-date , while at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand my priority , my heart and my soul lies with Warp Eleven , a site that has over 300 regular visitors every day and more then 50,000 hits since it 's birth . That site needs an almost daily update , to keep up with the flow Star Trek generates world-wide . And besides that , I like to have and keep a social life as well ! <p> The announcement goes on to mention that anyone wanting to take over the site should mail Leonard Schuurmans , so if you 've always dreamt of running a portal site , here 's your chance ! People in need of Trek news , meanwhile , should visit Warp 11 itself ( after first exploring TrekToday , of course : - ) ) <p> " I have just begun the very preliminary discussions with the studio about content and characters and schedule and when and how and where for another feature film . We are in such an infant stage that it is n't appropriate for me to say anything now . But suffice it to say that discussions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about a month ago , which read as follows : <p> Shortly before the release of Star Trek : Insurrection , Rick Berman and a top-level Paramount executive met with Brannon Braga ( Generations , First Contact , ST:Voyager ) to discuss the next movie . This was nothing more than a preliminary discussion , and quite possibly a digression during a meeting called for some other purpose . This does however confirm that Paramount is aware of Braga 's availability and that they are conscious of the need to begin working on the film as early as possible . I have also heard ( from the same source ) that they are aiming ( however desultorily at this point ) for a 2001 release , probably Thanksgiving . Keep in mind that Braga is probably first in line for the project , but even he admits that it 's way too far off at this point . <p> The ratings for " The Disease " would most certainly be average or above average if it were n't for the enormous amount of timeslot competition . The Grammys on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The Nutty Professor " earned a 9.6 , and NBC continued its strong sweeps presentations of " Law &amp; Order , " which earned a 9.2 overnight . Despite the losses at the hands of the high-powered specials , Voyager was able to finish 5th in its timeslot , defeating " Charmed , " which was also heavily hit by the Grammys competition , falling to a 4.8/7 . <p> Quite why anyone would actually want to watch ' The Nutty Professor ' is beyond me , but apparently a lot of people did n't share my opinion of the movie . Read the full report for more . Also new is the ratings report for DS9 's ' The Emperor 's New Cloak ' , the first show during sweeps month , with some great news : <p> Deep Space Nine kicked its final February sweeps off with a roar , storming out of reruns to claim a 4.6 rating , ranking 13th , the highest rating since " Treachery , Faith , and the Great River " ' s 4.8 earlier this year . That 4.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the last first-run episode , " Prodigal Daughter " ( 4.3 ) . Despite the strong performance , the show was still down from last year 's " Who Mourns for Morn , " which earned a 5.3 . <p> The news on the competitive front was even better , seeing DS9 destroy both Xena and Hercules , and again winning the #1 syndicated drama position . Hercules was second with a 4.3 , down an unbelievable 44% from last year . Xena limped in to third with a 4.1 , down 30% from last year . With Xena on the downward slope and Hercules staying steady , DS9 is now in excellent position to finish as the #1 firstrun syndicated drama on the season -- a postion it has n't been in in over two years . <p> Scarlett Pomers Convention AppearanceChristian ( 11:43 am CST ) Courtesy of the Official Scarlett Pomers Homepage comes the news that Scarlett Pomers , the actress playing young Naomi Wildman on Voyager , will soon be appearing at her first ever Star Trek convention .

The convention will be held in the Fairfield Community Center , and tickets will be sold at the door . <p> Daily Sci-Fi Reviews TrekChristian ( 11:05 am CST ) Not wanting to be outdone by Mania Magazine , the Den 's Daily Sci-Fi has also posted reviews of DS9 's ' Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang ' and Voyager 's ' Disease . ' Funnily enough , their opinion of the episodes matches Mania 's - they liked ' Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang ' and they hated ' Disease . ' They award the DS9 episode four stars out of five , praising the good use of DS9 's characters : <p> And even in an episode as light-hearted as this , it 's apparent that " DS9 " has developed a complex , enjoyable set of characters these past years . Even the non-regulars , the secondary characters -- Penny Johnson as Kasidy Yates , Aron Eisenberg as Nog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dimensional folks who could easily be primary characters on any other show . <p> Check out the full review for more . Unfortunately , ' Disease ' receives only two stars out of five , giving reviewer Sarah Kuhn a good chance to express her dislike : <p> OK , " Voyager " people , we 're going to play a guessing game . The point of this week 's episode is : <p> a ) to illuminate the touching mother-son bond between Janeway and Ensign Kim . <p> b ) to make an important , metaphorical point about love ( as in : it hurts , man ) . <p> c ) to give guest star Musetta Vander a special award for the most incomprehensible accent since Deanna Troi . <p> Mania Reviews ' Disease'Christian ( 10:50 am CST ) After yesterday 's review of ' Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang ' , AnotherUniverse.com 's Mania Magazine has now also published a review of Voyager 's ' Disease .

In the chat , people got the chance to ask some questions to lead designer Chris Taylor , project leader Erik Bethke and lead programmer Marc Hertog . You can find the chat log here , and thanks go out to Evil Avatar for pointing me to it . <p> Happy Birthday Chase Masterson ! Christian ( 10:27 am CST ) Today 's the birthday of Chase Masterson , who is best known as Dabo Girl Leeta on Deep Space Nine , although she has also presented her own show on the SciFi channel . She is loved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online at the Chase Masterson Official Fan Club Page , where you can sign Chase 's own guestbook . If , instead , you 'd like to send her a personal e-mail , you can do so via her own site at ChaseMasterson.com . We here at the Trekzone Network wish her a happy birthday as well ! <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:27 am CST ) -Tonight , the SciFi Channel will be broadcasting the 2nd-season TOS episode ' Wolf in the Fold , ' focusing on Mr. Scott . The episode airs at 7:30pm Eastern Time , and is repeated at 11:30 . <p> -In the UK , Sky One is showing the first-season Voyager episode ' Parturition ' at 5:00pm GMT , with a rerun at 11:30pm . Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:26 am CST ) Apparently a lot of people decided to hop over to TREKSEEK.COM yesterday , after visiting TrekToday , as we got a rather large amount of new site submissions . Take a look at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Trek news sites out there I visit daily , and I was surprised to see we had n't added it to Trekseek yet . It is in now , though , so go take a look ! -Next time you 're waiting for a new Trek episode to air , go visit Star Trek : The Cantabrian Expeditions , where you can experience the adventures of Captain Turner and his crew aboard the Starship Cantabrian ! -The United Fan Con is New England 's Premier ( Fan-Run ) Media Science Fiction Convention , held each fall in SPringfield , MA . The convention benefits the American Cancer Society . <p> As usual , these were n't the only sites that were added to Trekseek yesterday . To take a look at all the other new sites that were added to our database of 782 Star Trek sites , you can see them here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:24 am CST ) ' Wow ! ' That 's about how I reacted when I looked at our stats program today , and noticed the hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a special thanks to those of you who sent me some feedback on the site - I really appreciate it . Although I loved all of the mails , there was one which particularly excited me , namely the one from Lauren Grubb , who informed me that TrekToday has won the ' Reel Site of Gold . ' It 's the first award TrekToday has won , and I 'm very proud of it . My thanks go out to Lauren , and also to Saleel Majeed , my co-webmaster , who designed most of the page . <p> In other news today , you may have noticed a few minor changes in the area of the site just below ' Hello World ! ' First of all , we moved up the advert a bit , in order to wickedly trick you all in clicking on it : - ) . I hasten to point out , though , that the ad is only there to help us minimize our losses - we certainly arent't making a profit out of these pages ( I wish ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two previous days . Yesterday , just after finishing my last update , I noticed that the page took an awful long time to load , so I removed the news from the previous two days from the main page . However , I did n't have the time to put that news somewhere else , so I did that today . <p> After this exceptionally long ' Hello World ! ' , let me once again thank you all for coming here . I hope I 'll see you again tomorrow ! <p> " The 41st Annual Grammy Awards " aired yesterday on CBS , and made Voyagers overnight rating pretty low . Voyager got a 4.9/7 , that is down 2.1 from last week . <p> What is pretty good is that Voyager beat WBs Charmed " , that got a 4.8/7 . <p> A final rating would be around 3.4 - 3.9 . <p> That is not very good for the February sweeps , which is 4.43 after last weeks two parter . ( Bliss 3.9 , Dark Frontier , part 1 4.7 , Dark Frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay above 4 , and WILL beat last year . <p> ' Trekkies ' To Be Released SoonChristian ( 12:32 pm CST ) The makers of ' Trekkies , ' the documentary starring Denise Crosby ( Tasha Yar ) , have just announced that the film will premiere on the 12th of March . The film will initially just open in Portland and Indianapolis , but Paramount will release the film nation-wide on May 21 . The film , which has been in production for what seems like ages now , is 87 minutes long and has been created by Neo Motion Pictures . In the documentary , Denise Crosby follows several Star Trek fans , and also interviews many Trek celebrities . More info can be found at the Official Web Site . <p> Xena and Hercules both aired first-run episodes , tying for first among the first-run syndicated dramas at a 4.3 each . That 's still below the season average for Xena and on par for Hercules . <p> This episode should n't hurt " The Emperor 's New Cloak , " but it wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rerun is the only show which performed below " Holosuite " ' s mark ( earning a 3.5 ) , but it led into the good 4.3 performance of " It 's Only a Paper Moon . " Next week , sweeps begins with comedy episodes from every series -- a move that can pay off or backfire . <p> DS9 : Final Chapter PreviewChristian ( 12:13 pm CST ) The Den 's Daily Sci-Fi has posted a preview of the last several episodes of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . The preview looks back a bit at the past seven years , and naturally also provides info on the final story arc : <p> In season seven , however , things have seemed a bit slack . Everybody knows that this is Deep Space Nine 's last season on TV , and for the first half of the season , the cast 's been slacking . Ezri 's been playing cute , Quark 's been off to the alternate universe , but it seems that the episodes have been special-effects light and placed in basic sets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Babylon 5 did the same thing a while ago when it went off the air in the fourth season ( moving to TNT for its fifth and last ) , and the last episode or two had massive amounts of computer-generated eye candy . DS9 promises the same . <p> UPN 's begun broadcasting Deep Space Nine : The Final Chapter teasers , promising an end to the Dominion War , a wrap-up for all the storylines , and a couple key deaths . Above all , it looks like we 're going to see massive fleet space battles and lots and lots of phasers . <p> Federation Outpost ClosingChristian ( 12:03 pm CST ) Unfortunately , after being in operation for a long time , Dark Commander of the Federation Outpost has just announced he is closing down his site . Together with FedCom , the Federation Outpost was one of the two major Birth of the Federation web sites , often offering exclusive news on the game . Over the last few months , Dark Commander updated less and less , and now it seems he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought on the subject I have come to a decision . I will be closing The Federation Outpost . This does not necessarily mean I will be leaving the Birth of The Federation Community . I want to thank everyone who visit The Federation Outpost over the past year . My last update at The Federation Outpost will be on Sunday , February 28th . <p> David Gerrold is of course well-known for his ' The Trouble With Tribbles ' script , while Kristine Kathryn Rusch has published at least a dozen Trek novels together with her husband , Dean Wesley Smith . The full list of nominees can be found here , and thanks go out to the Locus Online for bringing this to my attention . <p> This was fun in the way that Specter of the Gun was fun , and it was considerably better-written than the Classic Trek episode . I liked the casual affection among the characters , the steadiness of the relationships between Sisko and Kasidy and Kira and Odo - there was little overt intimacy but lots of subtle contact and chemistry - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of uniform , especially in funny shots like the slo-mo parade down the Promenade . And we got to hear Avery Brooks sing ! OK , so it was out of character ; no more than when Vic 's holographic Kira sang for Odo . <p> Michelle Green also notes how much she is going to miss DS9 when it has ended , and this episode marked a small farewell already , as it was probably the last light-hearted episode of the season . The full review has , of course , a synopsis of the episode and two extra paragraphs of analysis . <p> Starfleet Command NewsChristian ( 11:08 am CST ) For some reason there 's a huge amount of news today related to Interplay 's upcoming strategy game , Starfleet Command . First of all , there 's a new preview up at Computer Games Online , entitled ' Star Fleet Battles meets the Genesis Device . ' A short quote from the beginning of the preview : <p> Something often happens when a board game gets translated to a computer ; in many instances you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that changes it into a new thing that may , at one level , really resemble the original but , at another , is something new . This transformation is rather like that of a planet in Star Trek that gets hit by the Genesis Deviceit gets made anew , but it 's still a planet of the same size and base properties . Similarly , the hardcore Star Trek board game/miniatures system Star Fleet Battles has been hit by a Genesis device as it 's moved to the computer , and the result is the similaryet differentStar Trek : Starfleet Command , coming your way this Summer care of Interplay . <p> The full ( and rather lengthy ) preview can be found by clicking here , and offers a bunch of screenshots and some words from the creators of the game . <p> Speaking of these creators , they have n't been sitting around doing nothing , either , as they just opened the official Starfleet Command site . At the moment there is n't much to see yet ( the page did n't even load up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info on the game , a FAQ , and related links . Also , they opened a Starfleet Command forum where people can ask questions to the designers - certainly head designer Chris Taylor was very active on the forum when I just visited . <p> Lastly , there 's a chat coming up tonight with three members of the Starfleet Command team - the aforementioned Chris Taylor , project leader Erik Bethke and lead programmer Marc Hertog . The chat takes place at 6:00pm Pacific Time , and you can either go to http : **26;978;TOOLONG on the internet , or use an IRC client to log into chat.annex.com ( port 6667 ) and join #interplay . <p> New York Observer Trek ArticleChristian ( 10:41 am CST ) The New York Observer has just put an article on its site about the conflict between Paramount and Samuel Ramer , author of ' The Joy of Trek : How to Enhance Your Relationship With a Star Trek Fan . ' The article , which will apparently appear in the New York Observer of next monday , talks about the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Ramer wrote the 217-page guide , published in 1997 by Carol Publishing Group Inc. , without permission of Paramount Pictures Corporation , a fact he points out in a cover disclaimer : " This book has not been authorized by any entity involved with the creation or production of Star Trek . " Paramount soon sued , asking for $23 million in damages , $100,000 for each of 230 episode citations . In June 1998 , Star Trek 's copyright holders convinced a Federal judge in Manhattan that Mr. Ramer had lovingly included too many details from the franchise 's television episodes , movies and spinoff books in chapters like " How Did Scotty Get So Old and Fat ? " The judge ordered the book 's distribution stopped . As they say in Klingon , net'oy ! that hurts ! Mr. Ramer and his publisher appealed . <p> The appellate argument , scheduled for April , will focus on how much " fair use " a fan can make of his favorite show when writing about it for money . Beyond that , in an age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feud between the executives at the top of synergy and the writers down below . " It cuts both ways , " said Steven Schragis , the lawyer-owner of Carol . " The concept of what is and is n't fair use , in a world where there 's so much branding and so much controlled by media outlets , would be welcome . " <p> The full article goes on to talk a bit about the background of the case , the publisher 's less than sterling motivations for publishing the book , and a touching paragraph about the author 's motivations : <p> Now 35 , Mr. Ramer views his Star Trek devotion as the bootstrap that lifted him from a single-parent household in the South Bronx to the top-rank Bronx High School of Science and to the District Attorney 's office . " There were a lot of bright kids stuck in bad situations , " he said . " We saw that one day our way of thinking would triumphthat smart people would be respected , and that technology would invent new ways for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Thanks go out to Mr. Video Productions for pointing to this . As an interesting sidenote , people interested in reading this book should maybe go to the UK , where the book is not banned from the stores . In the UK , it 's called ' Coping with your Trekkie ' and , after having read it , I must say it 's really not very special . <p> -Today in the UK , Sky One is broadcasting the 1st-season Voyager episode ' Non Sequitur ' at 5:00pm GMT , with a rerun at 11:30PM . Meanwhile , the BBC is broadcasting the 1st-season DS9 episode ' Babel , ' one of my personal favourites . ' Babel ' airs at 6:00pm . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:20 am CST ) Yesterday , we added 3 links to the database of TREKSEEK.COM , bringing us to a total of 776 sites . We intend to have 800 sites next weekend , so we 'll probably start manually adding sites over the next few days again . Anyways , let 's look at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new sites in our Trek Art category , offering you the chance to buy high-quality , hand-drwan sketches of the actors comprising the entire original cast of Star Trek Voyager. -A site which I personally recommend to everyone is Star Trek Episodes You 'll Never See , the personal homepage of Ethan H. Calk . He is the man who wrote the stories for the DS9 episodes ' Visionary ' and ' Children of Time , ' and on this site he tells about his experiences writing the shows , his visit to the sets , and his rejected story ideas . <p> If you 'd like to see the other sites that were included in Trekseek yesterday , you can do so by going here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:09 am CST ) Well , just a few minutes ago I posted the announcement about TrekToday to all the major newsgroups , so hopefully the number of hits should explode . If you 're currently reading this , chances are this is your first visit to the site , so I 'll repeat some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened . <p> Here at Trektoday , we 'll be offering you a daily guide to literally everything that 's happening in the world of Trek . We 'll be covering things such as Trek games , novels , toys and , of course , the latest episode news , but we 'll also bring you up to date on major things happening with all the other Trek sites out there . From now on , we 'll be updating the site everyday at approximately 10:00 AM CST/17:00 CET , and I hope you 'll be there with us ! <p> Of course , updating the site takes time , so if you drop in and only see ' Hello World ! ' , or just a few news items , it might be a good idea to check out a few hours later . It takes me approximately 90 minutes to do an update , so if you check back at 19:00 CET/12:00pm CST you should see the full update . I hope you enjoy the site , and I 'd really appreciate it if you let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again tomorrow ! <p> On the eve of Dr. Bashir 's departure for a conference on the Romulan homeworld , he 's visited by Sloan , the director of Section Thirty-one , a secret and unsanctioned extremist entity within Starfleet Intelligence . Sloan asks a reluctant Bashir to gather information on the Romulan leadership . Bashir reports the request to Sisko , who worries that although Starfleet Command has officially condemned Section Thirty-one , someone in its membership may actually be protecting the group . After consulting with Admiral Ross , Sisko advises Bashir to play along with SLoan in order to determine Sloan 's motivations . <p> Thanks go out to Warp 11 , where I found this short blurb describing the episode . <p> " The execs are rumored to start discussing another telemovie next season . I do know that they are trying to keep voyager stable enough to stay on the air for a season or two . My guess is that they would probably release the new series when the Star Wars hype goes down . A large ad campaign is a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the end of trek as we know it ... help save trek by at least turning on the TV when Voyager is on . If you ca n't bear to watch , just put it on mute and go about your business until it is over . This is the only chance you have to get through to the execs . More Later ... " <p> Remember , I 'm not sure how reliable all of this is - nor is any of it very ground-breaking . I 'd keep an open mind , but I would n't believe any of it until it is confirmed by another source . <p> Ryan : Boy ... This in not an intentional plug for the show , but Dark Frontier is my favorite . There are so many that I 've loved ... Drone is another great one from this season . The Killing Game 2-parter from last year . The Gift ... I can just go on . I think most of those are Brannon Braga scripts . I think he 's done an enormous amount for the show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the padding is referring to ... I assume you mean my cat suit . I think it 's fine . I have no problem with the physical presence of this character being overtly sexy because of the way she 's written . She 's too intelligent and too strong and too beautifully developed to be anything but a very positive example of a woman . <p> In the rest of the transcript Jeri Ryan answers some questions about her birthday , the future of Voyager , and about her personal life . Thanks go out to the Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Fan Club for reporting this . <p> Take what we 're about to show you , for example . One of our ad execs was looking through a clearance bin of old videos , and found a tape that had original series Star Trek bloopers and outtakes on them . After viewing them a couple times , we decided we had to put these up . Not only are they funny , some of the stuff has Kirk , Spock , McCoy , Bones , Nurse Chapel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather forget . Check ' em out ! <p> By going here , you 'll be able to find 18 videoclips showing all the worst bloopers that you simply *have* to see . But be warned - do n't attempt to download them all if you 've got just a 14k4 modem , as they 're all rather huge . <p> Cinescape Spoils DS9 episodeChristian ( 11:14 am CST ) As usual before a DS9 episode airs , Cinescape has published a spoiler preview of this week 's new DS9 episode , ' Badda-Bing , Badda-Bang . ' The episode features the return of ' everybody 's favorite holodeck performer , Vic Fontaine ' , and is completely spoiled in the preview by Michael Marek . Only read if you do n't want to enjoy the episode : - ) . <p> ' Dark Frontier ' Rates At Nr. 86Christian ( 11:08 am CST ) Thanks to Reuters , this Yahoo ! News article lists the top 20 Prime Time TV programs from the past week . As usual , Voyager was n't in the top-20 , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 . In UPN terms this was amazing - ' Dark Frontier ' was the best-rated UPN show in over a year . <p> As part of the plan , Viacom announced Tuesday it will create a new division to run its online businesses and may eventually spin it off into a separate company , hoping to cash in on the Internet 's growing popularity among consumers and investors . <p> ... <p> Viacom would not say how much it is spending overall to expand its online business , but said it will pour $250 million over the next five years into promoting the sites on the cable networks . Viacom has already used similar cross-promotion strategies to create successful movies and books from the TV shows Star Trek ' ' and Rugrats . ' ' <p> I do n't actually believe Viacom will actually start shutting down sites again , but I just thought it was interesting to note - their last campaign started when they needed to attract a lot of people to The Continuum . <p> For the fourth quarter , Interplay reported net revenues of $20.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year earlier . Net loss for the fourth quarter was $16.6 million , or $0.91 per share , compared with a net profit of $6.5 million , or $0.54 per share ( diluted ) , for the fourth quarter of 1997 . Included in the fourth quarter loss was a provision to increase the valuation allowance related to the company 's net deferred tax asset . <p> Over the entire year , Interplay reported a net loss of $28.2 million , which is nearly twice as much as the year before . As a reaction to the news , Interplay shares dropped to $2 , from $2 1/4 . However , according to Brian Fargo , chairman and CEO for Interplay , things are going to get better : <p> The fourth quarter loss , which was anticipated , was due to several factors . As previously noted , we were unable to ship two important titles , Messiah and EWJ 3D , during the quarter . In addition , Baldur 's Gate , the #1 selling PC game in January according to PC Data , did not ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quarter to about half the projected volume . Finally , we experienced higher returns than usual in the fourth quarter . ' ' <p> The full press release goes on to provide full financial details from the past year , and also talks a bit about the future of the company . Unfortunately , the press release does n't talk at all about ' The Secret of Vulcan Fury , ' the adventure game starring the original crew that was recently put ' on hold . ' However , Brian Fargo does mention that they will concentrate on ' role playing games and on sequel or branded titles with proven talent , ' which could indirectly refer to ' Vulcan Fury . ' Once again , Interplay 's web site can be found here , and the full press release here on Yahoo . People interested in saving ' Secret of Vulcan Fury , ' meanwhile , should probably visit Star Trek Gaming Central for the ' help save SoVF ' campaign . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:32 am CST ) -Tonight at 9.00 PM Eastern Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Disease , ' in which Harry Kim falls in love with an alien woman , much to the dismay of captain Janeway .

But the escapade puts both the Voyager crew and the Varro species in Jeopardy when Kim and Tal become biochemically interdependent . <p> Thanks to Mr. Video Productions for this screen capture of the preview , which is , of course , copyrighted by Paramount . <p> -Also in the US , the SciFi Channel is broadcasting the 2nd-season episode ' The Deadly Years , ' which is the one where everyone ages .

Christian ( 10:09 am CST ) Trekseek.com , the largest , most accessible Star Trek search engine , welcomed another few sites to its database of 774 Star Trek sites yesterday . Some of these new sites include : <p> -The D.S.S. Pegasus , a brand new site that is trying to bring you everything Star Trek at one site . I was the 6th visitor when I arrived at the site , so there 's still plenty of room in their counter for more hits ! -TREKTODAY.COM , which is the first and only daily updated guide to all things .... what 's that ? You 've already heard of the site ? Oh , well , never mind then : - ) . <p> Naturally these are n't the only new sites that were added to Trekseek today - if you want to see the full listing , go here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 9:59 am CST ) Today I started submitting the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course TrekToday can already be found at our own Trekseek.com search engine , but over the next few days the site should appear in Treknews.com 's Treksearch.com and the Star Trek Central search engine . Of course , I did n't forget Yahoo and Excite either , we should appear there as well within a few days/weeks , and I hope they will attract many visitors to the site . <p> But , of course , the search engines are not the most important way to get hits - links from other sites are . If you 've got a Star Trek site , and you enjoy Trektoday , why not put up a link to us ? In a few days we 'll also be offering some lovely banners for your linking pleasure , and I 'd really appreciate it if you linked to TrekToday . <p> Tuesday February 23 , 1999 <p> Christie Golden Convention AppearanceChristian ( 12:45 pm CST ) Starland , the organizer of the Starfest ' 99 convention , has announced that Trek novelist Christie Golden will be making an appearance at their convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April the 16th , has already secured Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) and Max Grodenchik ( Rom ) for their appearance list , while a lot of other SF celebrities will also be making an appearance . <p> Worf Joins the CultChristian ( 12:04 pm CST ) The March Issue ( #42 ) of the Cult Times has as its main story , as you can see from the cover , a five-page interview with Michael Dorn ( Worf ) . As usual , they have provided us with a short extract from the full interview , in which Dorn talks about the two most recent Trek movies : <p> Looking back , can Dorn pick a single favourite Trek experience ? Yes , he can , actually . " I think Star Trek : First Contact was the culmination of Next Gen. That 's been my favourite , " he explains . " I 'd totally enjoyed being on Next Gen for the seven years we did the show , and First Contact was truly the culmination because that was the first true TNG movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no Kirk , no Scotty , and no Chekov . It was just us and we did incredibly well on our own . " <p> As for more recent experiences , that brings us to Star Trek : Insurrection and the imminent end of Deep Space Nine . First , Dorn looks back on Insurrection , the latest Next Gen film adventure , which performed so-so at the box office following so-so reviews and so-so Trekker response ... " When I saw the movie I thought it was OK . People seemed to like that it was romantic , light and funny . That 's not my taste . I like the dark , edgy stuff . I can watch that all day . " <p> In the rest of the extract , Dorn goes on to talk about his disappointment over the last few years of Deep Space Nine , and there are some interesting tidbits about Dorn 's career . The full article , which was written by Ian ' Inside Trek ' Spelling , can unfortunately only be read by buying the magazine . Thanks go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One by one , members of the Voyager crew begin to deteriorate until they realize they are actually clones of themselves and must make a time capsule to re-find and save themselves . <p> You can find the Vidiot preview of the episode , which also includes an MP3 audio file , here , but you can also download the video clip directly by clicking here . Thanks go out to Warp 11 , where I found the short blurb describing the episode . <p> Hello all . Brannon Braga posting . I 've read the postings on our two-hour with great interest , and I wanted to respond to the issue of " nitpicking . " First of all , we enjoy the way viewers analyze and dissect the episodes . It keeps us on our toes and shows a great deal of intelligence and attention to detail on the part of our audience . What more could we ask for ? Secondly , it 's important for you to know that we spend a great deal of time tracking continuity and figuring out the potential plot holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a mistake , it drives us crazy . If only we could go back and fix them ! But we NEVER ignore continuity , as it has been suggested by some of the more cynical people on this site . We take tremendous care in crafting these episodes . It is absurd to think that we are lazy or simply disregard the Trek time-line , as it were . " Dark Frontier " was a project of passion for us -- we tried to create the most exciting , detailed , emotional two hours that we could , considering the time contraints of television . We hope you enjoyed it . As for the " mistakes " -- what would you discuss here if there were none ? <p> Production Designer Chat on ThursdayChristian ( 11:05 am CST ) This thursday , there 's a chat coming up at The Continuum with Richard James , who is currently serving as production designer on Voyager , after also working in this capacity on The Next Generation . The chat begins at 06:30 PM PT , and instructions on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your question answered , it might be a good idea to submit them now , which is the reason I 'm posting this update . <p> New Trek ReviewsChristian ( 12:33 pm CST ) This is also going to be a regular feature at TrekToday , at least during the months that Trek is not on hiatus . In this section , I 'll be informing you of the latest reviews to be written by the regular Trek reviewers ( Tim Lynch , Jammer , Delta Blues , Cynic 's Corner ) , including some highlights from their reviews and direct links to them . <p> On sunday , Jamahl Epsicokhan ( Jammer ) uploaded his long overdue Insurrection review , which is n't exactly filled with praise of the latest Trek movie : <p> The movie is entertaining in a superficial way . I sort of liked Insurrection . But I also felt kind of disappointed afterward . Considering TNG movies only happen once every two ( or more , in the future ) years , it seems to me that more should be done with a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glides in , solves the problem , and glides out--end of story . What 's lacking are the lingering questions . A fountain of youth is something that would change the perception of the entire Federation . Is n't that worth examining ? Having one admiral ( who dies ) as the sole Federation representative for eternal youth is simply not enough , and watching the Enterprise fly away from what could be the Greatest Discovery Ever seems a little simplistic . <p> In DS9 news , Tim Lynch has just posted his ' Chimera ' review to the **25;1006;TOOLONG newsgroup , one of his most positive reviews to appear in a long time : <p> Last week , I expressed a hope that the second half of DS9 's final season would prove stronger than its first . If " Chimera " is any indication , that hope may well be borne out ; this episode managed to get across Odo 's true " alien-ness " better than just about anything which has come before , and told a compelling story in the bargain . <p> Please note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow it 'll probably look a lot different . Maybe I 'll just include links to the reviews , and not give any highlights at all - I 'll see how this works , and you 'll be able to see how I changed it ... <p> Happy Birthday Majel BarrettChristian ( 10:43 am CST ) Today 's the 60th birthday of Majel Barret-Roddenberry , the wife of the late Gene Roddenberry . She also holds the honour of being the only actor that has worked on all incarnations of Trek , from her role as Number One in ' The Cage , ' via Christine Chapel in TOS to her roles of Lwaxana Troi and the Computer voice in the TNG-era series . Currently she is also working as producer on the other Gene Roddenberry series currently in production , Earth : Final Conflict . We wish her a happy birthday ! <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:37 am CST ) -Viewers of the SciFi Channel will be able to enjoy the TOS second-season episode ' Friday 's Child ' tonight at 7.30 PM Eastern Time . The episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky One is broadcasting the first-season Voyager episode ' The 37s ' at 5.00 PM GMT with a rerun at 11.30 PM . ( Actually , the episode was shown as the second season opener in the US , but it was originally filmed for the 1st season ) Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> New at Trekseek.comChristian ( 10:27 am CST ) As usual , there was n't much happening on monday for Trekseek , and we only had one new site added to our database . Today we also removed one site from our database - Starbase 99 , the Starship Creator site that has been reigning at the top spot of the Trekseek Fan Favourites for the past month now . However , since the owner of Starbase 99 , Captain Dan , has joined the people at Starabse Prometheus and closed down his site , we had no choice but to remove his site 's listing as well . Thanks to everyone who voted for the site . Anyways , the one site that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely : <p> - Deep Space Alpha , which is a Starship Creator fan site where you 'll be able to find extra ships for the game . <p> If you 'd like to check out the other 18 sites that were added to our 772 sites large database over the past week , you can do so by going here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:17 am CST ) In the unlikely event that you visited here yesterday , you may have noticed that some of the items of yesterday 's update did n't actually exist yet until today . The reason for this is that today I was tweaking the site a little and decided to also implement some graphics in the actual news updates - hence the Sev Trek cartoon and the Sky teletext capture . I 'll probably do some more experimenting over the past few days ( which is why we have n't announced TrekToday to any newsgroups or search engines yet ) , so stay tuned for some pleasant surprises ! <p> Some terrific news for you Star Trek fans came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD blowout for late May or early June . That 's when the studio plans to release it 's recent feature film Star Trek : Insurrection to DVD . But even more exciting , the studio will also release two DVDs of episodes of the original Star Trek TV series at the same time ! The discs will include two episodes each , in the order that they were originally broadcast . And here 's some even better news - the episodes will be the new Star Trek : Sci-Fi Channel Special Edition versions , and will include all the special introductions and cast interviews . If these two discs sell well , look for Paramount to begin releasing the entire series , a few episodes at a time . <p> The full report , which can be found here , goes on to talk about the release of DVDs such as ' ST5:The Final Frontier ' and ' ST:The MOtion Picture . ' Lastly , today the page updated again with the following news : <p> From a very reliable source , comes word that that Star Trek : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widescreen ( 16x9 enhanced ) . That 's more good news for you Trek fans out there . <p> Today I went to the star trek convention today in New Orleans , with guest Jeri Ryan , and she slipped some information to us . She said that in the upcoming voyager episode where she goes back in time , with the help of the future time traveling starfleet , to get rid of a bomb that is planted on voyager while the ship is in drydock , ( showing the ship just before the series premiere ) The 29 century starfleet hide her Borg technology so she looks fully human ! ! She then gets to dress up like an ensign in a starfleet uniform ! ! <p> In the upcoming episode where her and the doctor go on a date it is actually that the doctor is preparing seven for a future date in that episode where she will go out with some guest star . The doctor does " develop " feelings for seven . He is showing her how to make conversation that is interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:59 pm CST ) As you may know , the British television station Sky One also offers a teletext service . Page 192 is dedicated exclusively to Star Trek , showing several headlines each monday . The catch is that viewers can then call a special phone number at 50p per minute and hear the actual stories behind those headlines . Thanks to the Trekzone Network 's own Saleel Majeed we 'll be bringing you the latest headlines each and every week , but please do keep in mind that their news is not very reliable to say the least . This week 's headlines include : <p> Once again , I would n't believe any of these headlines until they are confirmed elsewhere , but we decided to include them here for amusement value anyways . <p> The page also mentions some other cool chats coming up , including chats with Voyager writers Bryan Fuller , Nick Sagan and Michael Taylor . You can find more info on the chats , including details on how to participate , by clicking here . <p> Scarlett Pomers NewsChristian ( 12:39 pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actress playing young Naomi Wildman , has updated following last week 's showing of ' Dark Frontier , ' which marked Scarlett 's fifth appearance . In their Star Trek : Voyager section , you can now find a synopsis of Scarlett 's scenes , a screen grab image , plus two video clips of her performances in ' Dark Frontier ' and ' Once Upon a Time . ' <p> New Sev Trek Cartoon Christian ( 12:27 pm CST ) As you may be aware of , Australian cartoonist John Cook creates a weekly Star Trek comic strip called Sev Trek . Every monday , we here at the Trekzone Network will be presenting you with the latest Sev Trek Comic in the following fashiom : <p> Mania Magazine Reviews TrekChristian ( 12:18 pm CST ) Mania Magazine has posted its reviews of last week 's new Trek episodes , namely DS9 's ' Chimera ' and Voyager 's high-profile two-hour episode ' Dark Frontier . ' As usual , reviewer Michelle Erica Green is very thorough , first giving a detailed synopis of the episode , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ' Dark Frontier ' review : <p> Visually and dramatically , this was a terrific episode , though it made mincemeat of all previous Borg history on Star Trek and even discarded most of what we learned about Seven of Nine 's human parents in fourth-season episodes . I thought the first hour was better-directed than the second , particularly the dark shots on the Borg ship , but both halves of " Dark Frontier " were creepy and gripping , and the performances by Kate Mulgrew , Jeri Ryan , and Susanna Thompson were all first-rate even if Thompson did n't quite have the bite of First Contact 's Alice Krige . <p> To read the full review , you can click here . After these words of praise on ' Dark Frontier , ' she is perhaps even more positive on DS9 's chimera : <p> Perhaps the finest love story ever told on television , let alone on Trek , Kira and Odo 's affair demonstrates that such a romance can be told with dramatic as well as emotional appeal . Before I discuss the intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the gradual arc in which it developed . I know better than to think the Trek writers planned it all out ; I 'm sure the consummation of the relationship was a decision made over the course of a few weeks , rather than ( as with Mulder and Scully 's kiss in Fight the Future ) a few years . But however they did it , the powers that be created a stunning example of how relationships can be developed and sustained without ever falling into soap opera or Moonlighting traps . <p> Happy Birthday Jeri RyanChristian ( 12:34 pm CST ) Today is the birthday of Jeri Ryan , Borg drone extraordinaire , who turns 31 . As you probably all know , Jeri Ryan is currently portraying Seven of Nine on Star Trek Voyager , and recently played an important role in the two hour television movie ' Dark Frontier . ' Before getting the role on Voyager , Jeri Ryan also starred in the last seven episodes of ' Dark Skies , ' and she has performed in guest roles on series such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More information on Jeri Ryan can be found at her official fan club , and we here at the Trekzone Network wish here a happy birthday ! <p> Happy Birthday Gary LockwoodChristian ( 12:02 pm CST ) Yesterday was the 61st birthday of Gary Lockwood , who guest starred as Kirk 's friend Gary Mitchell in the 2nd TOS pilot ' Where No Man Has Gone Before . ' Even though Mitchell died in that episode , there are still various Trek novels in which he plays an important role , most recently the ' My Brother 's Keeper ' trilogy by Michael Jan Friedman . Gary Lockwood himself is probably the most famous for his 1968 starring role in the movie version of Arthur C. Clarke 's ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey , ' but Trek fans may also be interested to know that he was also the main star of the short-lived Gene Roddenberry series ' The Lieutenant . ' <p> Today on TVChristian ( 11:58 am CST ) Do n't you just hate it when you turn on the telly only to see the end credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see ? Or when you put down everything , and get ready for an exciting new episode of Trek , only to get yet another re-run of ' Spock 's Brain ? ' Well , here is the solution ! From now on , we 'll be informing which episodes are broadcasted on a particular day in the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany and the Netherlands . You 'll never have to miss an episode again ! <p> -Today , the SciFi Channel will broadcast the 2nd-season TOS episode ' Journey To Babel , ' the episode which introduces Spock 's parents . The episode airs at 7:30 PM Eastern Time , with a re-run at 11:30 PM . <p> -In the UK , Sky One will broadcast the first-season Voyager episode ' Twisted ' at 5 PM GMT , with a re-run at 11:30 PM . Furthermore , at 8 PM GMT they 're broadcasting a new DS9 episode from the sixth season , ' Inquisition . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit at the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already heard about Trekseek.com , the " largest , most accessible Star Trek search engine on the net ! " With more than 750 sites in its database , Trekseek is truly the best starting point for Trek fans on the Internet . In the ' New at Trekseek.com ' section , we 'll be describing some of the latest sites to be added to Trekseek over the past day , everyday ! <p> Yesterday , 4 new sites were added to the Trekseek database , bringing us to a grand total of 772 sites . Take a look at some of those sites : <p> -800-Trekker is one of the the largest collectibiles online stores , selling merchandise from many different sci-fi shows . They 've got a lot of Trek stuff , but you can also find merchandise from other SF series , such as Babylon 5 , Star Wars or the X-Files. -The Starfleet Command Football Club has to be seen to be believed . Here you can play ' fantasy football in the 24th century ! ' -Lastly , the Nuketown Star Trek homepage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably does n't really fit in the Indices/Awards and Ratings category it 's currently in . In the near future we 'll probably create a special category for review sites , but for now you can already check out the site ! <p> These were the sites which we deemed most worthy of mentioning here , but if you want to read the full list of new sites , you can find it here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:22 am CST ) Hi , and welcome to TrekToday ! Starting today , we 'll be offering you a daily guide to literally everything that 's happening in the world of Trek . We 'll be covering things such as Trek games , novels , toys and , of course , the latest episode news , but we 'll also bring you up to date on major things happening with all the other Trek sites out there . From now on , we 'll be updating the site everyday at approximately 10:00 AM CST/17:00 CET , and I hope you 'll be there with us ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of the site , and we 'd love to hear some comments from you about the site 's look and feel . We know that the current design is still lacking somewhat , especially the top of the page still needs some extra features , but we very much wanted to get the site open for everyone to see , so that 'll come at a later date . Meanwhile , we hope you enjoy the site , and I hope to see you again tomorrow ! <p> Transwarp #58 Is OutChristian ( 12:48 pm CST ) My mailbox just informs me that Transwarp issue 58 has appeared . Features this month include the usual listing of upcoming episodes , books and events , but also reprints interviews with Brent Spiner and Jeri Ryan . Furthermore , the newsletter reprints articles on DS9 , fan campaigns , and several other news items that made their way to the net over the past few weeks . <p> Of course , this issue also includes the results of last week 's poll question , ' Do you think that The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , 32 people voted yes on this , while only one person was against . The full newsletter was probably already delivered to your mailbox , but if it was n't , you can always subscribe at the Official Transwarp Page . <p> In other news , the people at the Continuum have also posted their previews of next week 's DS9 and Voyager episodes . The DS9 episode , ' Chimera ' , the preview of which can be found here , also includes a 30-second video and one photo . <p> Odo returns from a conference with an unexpected guest : a Changeling who tracked and boarded his Runabout . Odo recognizes him as one of " the hundred " shapeshifters who were , like himself , sent out as infants into the galaxy to learn about other species . Back at the station , Sisko warily releases the visitor to Odo 's custody . The Changeling , known as Laas , queries Odo about their unique species -- with which Laas has made no contact since his infancy -- and " the Link , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby form a single , sentient collective entity . <p> I 'm not going to reprint anything from the Voyager preview , based on the fact that I doubt there is anyone left who *hasn't* heard about this episode yet . I 'll just direct you to the preview , which includes no less than 3 videos and 3 photos . <p> IT 'S BEEN FIVE YEARS since the Starship Voyager was assigned on a rescue mission to the Badlands to investigate the disappearance of a Maquis ship . Hurled into the Delta Quadrant , far away from home , Captain Janeway was faced with a desperate situation : to maintain the morale of her crew while joining forces with the renegade terrorists . They 've faced ruthless warriors , invaders , psychopaths and killers , and yet through it all Janeway has demonstrated her considerable leadership skills and humanity . She 's the ship 's matriarch - desperately attempting to keep together her eclectic ' family ' against all odds , while leading them back home to the Alpha Quadrant - and Earth . <p> The teaser article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show , but the thing we 're all anxious to read about ( her thoughts on leaving the series ) can only be found in the actual article itself . I 'd love it if someone who subscribes the magazine would fill me in on the news . <p> While we 're on the subject , this issue of TV Zone also includes news on DS9 's ending , an article with Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) , Earth : Final Conflict news and some reviews . I 'd tell you more about this , but unfortunately most of that ca n't be found on their web site . One other thing which *can* be found there is Tim Lynch 's review of the new DS9 novel ' The 34th Rule ' : <p> Shimerman ( along with co-author David R George III ) manages to keep the reader interested in the characters while weaving a tale of plans within plans within schemes . In addition , those who are familiar with Shimerman 's non-Quark characters inside Trek should keep an eye out for a few surprise guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books to come along in a while ; it 's definitely worth a look . <p> The full review ( or at least , the part of it that can be found online ) can be found here . Thanks to Warp 11 for reporting this . <p> The news for Hercules , and to a larger extent Xena , is definately getting worse . This week , Xena was down an awful 41% from last year to a 3.9 , finishing second . Hercules was marginally better , down 33% to a 4.0 , ending up in first for the week . Xena has fallen from first-run syndication dominance to the point where a DS9 rerun nearly matched a Xena first-run . If Xena continues with these paltry showings , DS9 should have little trouble reclaiming its #1 spot crown . <p> This two-month period saw all three syndicated dramas emerge from their December/January breaks . Two , DS9 and Hercules , came out of hibernation unscathed . Xena , on the other hand , has experienced a complete collapse , falling to some of its worst ratings ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DS9 performed very well . Over the break , the show had a tiny drop-off , maintaining nearly all of its audience ; both of the new January episodes also performed very near the season average of around a 4.4 . Hopefully , the episodes performed strong enough to hold the audiences over until February . Especially considering the quieter nature of both these episodes , their performances are encouraging for the upcoming sweeps . <p> You can read the full report , which also includes comparisons with last year , by clicking here . <p> I do n't have much else to say ; the detective story had holes ( experimental weapons just sitting around in lockers , deadly murder technology undetectable by ship 's sensors ) , the five-second appearances by most of the regulars appeared to have been phoned in , the directing was acceptable but as bottle shows go , this one had nothing to recommend it . If I have to sit through one more episode where good old wonderful human emotion is celebrated in relief against nasty cold Vulcan calculated logic , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' Fields of Fire ' is nothing compared to her hatred of ' Bliss ' : <p> There 's no way this episode could have struck any regular SF viewer as remotely interesting or original . <p> Jerry Goldsmith Is A Busy Man .... Christian ( 11:14 am CST ) ..... as he 's apparently agreed to provide the music for no less than 4 movies ! According to this report at Cinescape , the composer is currently hard at work scoring the new Universal Pictures movie ' The Mummy . ' Furthermore , Goldsmith is reportedly also providing the music for The 13th Warrior , The Hollow Man and The Haunting of Hill House . As you are probably aware of , Goldsmith is the man responsible for the 4 Trek soundtracks and the well-known TNG and Voyager themes . <p> Star Trek : New Worlds , a 3D Real Time Strategy game , is set in 2292 . In the Neutral Zone -- a quiet area of space situated equidistant between Federation , Romulan , and Klingon Territories -- where a spatial anomaly has created a clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit about the game 's story , gameplay and unique features of the game , but it 's nothing we have n't heard before .

SupportChristian ( 11:01 am CST ) A company press release from games company GT Interactive , which can be found here , talks about 3DNow ! support in upcoming GT games . 3DNow ! , a special technology built into AMD processors , significantly enhances 3D processing power , and is expected to be installed in 14 million systems by the end of this quarter . The good news for us is that one of the games that will feature 3DNow ! support will be ' Star Trek : Deep Space Nine : Milennium ' , currently in development by Collective Studios , using the Simon &amp; Schuster Deep Space 9 license . <p> Trek Storyboard Artist PromotedChristian ( 10:55 am CST ) Pacific Data Images has appointed John Bell as the Creative Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division . John Bell has just finished working as Production Designer on the recent hit movie ' Antz ' , but before that he was active on movies such as ' Contact ' and ' The Lost World ' . Several years ago , he also worked as Storyboard Artist on ' Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home ' , which is the reason I 'm mentioning this at all . I found this in this update at Yahoo ! News . <p> Happy Birthday Philip AnglimChristian ( 10:39 am CST ) Congratulations to Philip Anglim , who turn 46 today . Anglim is most famous to Trek fans for his role as Vedek Bareil on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , a role which ended rather tragically when the creators decided to kill him off in the third-season episode ' Life Support . ' A lot of fans did n't like this , as can be witnesses by the support site The Vedek 's Assembly , who launched a protest again . Last year , these fans were greeted with the episode ' Resurrection ' , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to read more about Anglim , you can find his unofficial fan club here . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:30 am CST ) - In the US , the SciFi Channel is broadcasting the second-season TOS episode ' The Changeling ' , which does n't actually deal with Odo , in case you were wondering . The episode airs at 6:30 PM Central Time , with a rerun at 10:30 PM . <p> - In the UK , Sky One is broadcasting the first-season Voyager episode ' Ex Post Facto ' at 5 PM GMT . An hour later , the BBC will continue with its rerun of DS9 's first season - tonight they 're showing ' Past Prologue ' at 6.00 PM GMT . Thanks to the Television Observation Unit for this . <p> New at Trekseek.com ! Christian ( 10:23 am CST ) We 've been adding a few sites to our Fan Clubs section again , specifically to the new Americas section . This section contains all the fan clubs we 're aware of that are located on the two American continents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States section and the Brazil section . Some of the sites we 've been adding to those sections today include : <p> -The Aztlan Earth Station , which is the page of what is probably the first Star Trek fan club in Mexico . The club gets together every two weeks to watch the most recent shows , talk , gossip and generally have a good time . -The Frota Estelar Brazil . From what I 've been able to gather from the poor Babelfish translation of the site , this is a company organising events for Brazilian Trekkers . If someone who speaks Portugese would like to give me a better explanation of the Brazilian sites , I 'd be very grateful to you . <p> These are n't actually the only sites to be added to our database of 738 Star Trek sites , but a full listing would be way too long for this news bulletin . However , you *can* find the listing here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:13 am CST ) Wow ! I just realized that I 've been doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors besides Saleel and me ... I must be mad . However , this is also the last update from me until I get back from a short holiday to Spain , and until the site actually opens . My current plan is that we open the site on sunday evening , when I 've been back for a day and after my first update to the site . Then I 'll start updating the site for a few days , and near the end of the week we 'll launch a promotional campaign to attract visitors to the site ( newsgroup announcements , search engine submissions , maybe the odd spamming service or two : - ) ) . <p> In other news today , you may have noticed that the site is loading a *lot* faster today . The reason for that is that we discovered we 'd forgotten to compress all the images before putting them on the site ( shame , blush ) . We managed to compress images such as the TrekToday logo from 37 KB to just 13 KB , which should definately help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in a week ! <p> Unreliable Rumours DepartmentChristian ( 1:07 pm CST ) As you may know , Star Trek web site Section 31 claims to have contacts with a Paramount insider named ' AL2000 ' . Today , Section 31 has reports on both Trek Series V and Star Trek X from this ' insider ' . The report begins with a concept which is supposedly being considered for the next Trek movie : <p> Andromeda subject ( which is still the leading Trek X storyboard ) - from what I hear I believe it involves three ships ( Enterprise E of course and another two which I have absulotely no clue about ) . Somehow they end up in the Andromeda Galaxy ( sort of like an original series episode ) . They find these horrible bad guys ( a bunch of new species ) . Talk is down now , it has sort of been shelved . They are too busy with Voyager and the new series . <p> The ' insider ' goes on to report on Series V , in a new section at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the following concepts are currently being considered by Paramount : <p> Riker &amp; New Crew- <p> A Riker and crew idea is also a leading concept . It would involve Riker on another ship ( not the Enterprise E , for it still exists ) . <p> Prequel Series ( pre Enterprise ) - <p> The prequel type series is a definite false rumor . Paramount does n't want to mimic the Star Wars franchise . <p> Another apparent rumour is a series set in the even more distant future , aboard the Enterprise-G . I would like to remind you of the news post on PlanetRiker yesterday , which declared both of these concepts to be completely untrue - something which I believe in , too . Please , do go ahead and check out the news at Section 31 , but remember not to take it too serious . <p> I was worried about this episode 's rating coming from the Overnight ratings , but this turned out quite well . A 4.0 to kick off February is a very , very good start to lead into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest-rated episodes of the series . If Voyager continues on course , it will easily crack last year 's sweeps mark -- a post-TNG first . " Bliss " marks the first episode airing during the technical sweeps period , followed by " Dark Frontier . " <p> Read the full report for more . The Insurrection Box Office Report has also been updated , it now includes information on the premiere here in the Netherlands . Also , it 's interesting to note that the movie 's current worldwide grosses place the film at the 5th place of all Trek films , just below ' The Voyage Home ' , ' Generations ' , ' First Contact ' and ' The Motion Picture . ' <p> Ordover On Media Tie-InsChristian ( 11:28 am CST ) There 's a letter exchange currently going on at the Locus Online , which is like the Daily Variety , but then for the SF book community ( or so I 'm told . ) In any case , the January and February editions of their ' letters ' section includes two letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , he talks on the subject of media tie-ins , a discussion which was ignited by an article by Steve Perry talking about media tie-ins in the SF world : <p> Printed science fiction will be dead in another generation , and it 's the media-tie ins , shared-universes , and novelizations that will kill it off . <p> I 've been hearing garbage like this for most of the forty-odd years I 've been reading , and more in the twenty-odd years I 've been writing , and after considered thought , here is my response - as precise as I can make it : <p> Bullshit . <p> In his first letter , dated the 4th of January , John Ordover responded to the commentary in this letter , in which he poses another question on media tie-ins : <p> Dear Locus , Since I edit the Star Trek novels , and am clearly biased , I 'm not going to comment directly on Steve 's essay , but instead pose another question . Why is it that the science fiction genre is vulnerable to the intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other genre is ? <p> If I had to blame anyone for the continued proliferation of tie-ins and other sub-par books throughout the genre , it would be the fans who are too lazy to try something different . <p> Of course , this was oil on John Ordover 's fire , so a month later he responded again , fiercely defending media tie-ins : <p> First off , reader bashing wo n't sell even one more copy of a straight SF book . Far as I can tell , it amounts to saying " Kids today ! How can they waste their time on that crap ? They should be expanding their minds reading good books ! " That last sound familiar ? Readers of SF media tie-ins are n't lazy . They are n't unwilling to try something different . They 've sampled straight SF and found it not to their liking . Why ? Bottom line , the majority of potential SF readers today want certain tropes in a certain context . <p> You can find out what precisely these tropes are in the full letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Thanks go out to Kevin Lauderdale for posting news of this to the Star Trek Book Board . <p> Yes unfortuantely First Contact was cancelled . BOF is still on track with a release dat of April 15 . <p> ... <p> Sincerely , Adam Microprose Customer Support <p> Paul Weaver , the FedCom webmaster , later sent out an update confirming this , stating he had received confirmation from three separate sources . <p> X-Men Movie In Pre-ProductionChristian ( 10:39 am CST ) Cinescape Online has a report on the upcoming X-Men movie from 20th Century Fox . Apparently Fox was in danger of losing the license due to Marvel 's recent re-organization due to bankruptcy . A press release from Fox , which I found at Yahoo ! , gives some more info on the film . The interesting part in that press release , and the reason I 'm talking about it here , is the news that Ralph Winter , who also worked on ' The Voyage Home ' , will be serving as executive producer for the feature . Furthermore , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-star in the movie , so that 'll give us an extra chance to see him in action ! <p> Voyager Top-Rated UPN ProgramChristian ( 10:15 am CST ) Courtesy of Yahoo ! , Reuters and Nielsen Media Research , the top 20 prime time TV programs for the week beginning the 1st of February have been published . As usual , Voyager was n't in the top 20 , but it *was* the top-rated UPN show , at No. 89 , which is also not unusual . <p> Today on TVChristian ( 10:09 am CST ) - In the US , UPN viewers will be able to enjoy a new Voyager episode , as tonight at 9.00 PM Eastern Time , UPN will broadcast ' Bliss ' . Take a look at ( a piece of ) the press release : <p> Finally , after five long years , an exhilarated crew of the U.S.S. Voyager finds a wormhole that will bring them back to the Alpha Quadrant . As the happy crew prepares to return to Earth , a skeptical Seven of Nine violates captain 's orders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot , Qatai , to help her stop the ship from entering the wormhole . <p> -Before that , to be precise at 6:30 PM Central Time , the SciFi Channel will broadcast the TOS episode ' Who Mourns For Adonais ' . If you miss it , they 're also airing a rerun at 10:30 PM Central Time . <p> -In the UK , the BBC is broadcasting the superb fifth-season TNG episode ' Cause and Effect ' at 6.00 PM GMT . Furthermore , Sky One will broadcast the first-season Voyager episode ' Eye of the Needle ' at 5.00 PM GMT , which is also repeated at 11.30 PM GMT .

First , in the morning , it starts to snow , so I look like the Giant Snowman when I leave the house . Then , during the day , it starts to rain . In the afternoon , it starts to snow again , so once more it 's Yati-time for me . Lastly , during the night this layer of snow/rain/blubber becomes solid as it starts to freeze , so the day afterwards I look like the Giant Snowmand *and* I break my neck . Why is n't it summer already ? <p> Paramount sources have read the story below ( 4 February ) and agree that the Riker series has at least been considered , but that idea of a series based around Captain Robert April has n't even been pitched to anyone at Paramount - so it 's not in the running . <p> PlanetRiker then continues with some comments I fully agree with , so I decided to reprint them here : <p> Planet Riker says : Anyone who thinks that Paramount will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Deep Space Nine finishes Paramount will still have a Trek series running ( it 's called Voyager , for those of you who might have forgotten ) . The priorities for Paramount right now are : <p> Added the numbers for the UK and Germany over the January 29-31 weekend . The movie is winding down its run in both areas , so some comparisons can be drawn to " First Contact " ' s run . In the UK , " Insurrection " opened stronger than " First Contact , " but fell off faster , and will most likely finish below " First Contact " ' s mark there . In Germany , the story was exactly reversed . There , " Insurrection " opened off from " First Contact , " but made it up in the later weeks and will just defeat " First Contact " for #1 Trek movie in Germany honors . Domestic figures put the movie just under $68 million . It should cross the $68 million mark next week . The movie is yet to begin its run in the cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between $69 and $70 million . <p> One of the few countries in which Insurrection is still going strong is the Netherlands , but then again the movie premiered here on thursday . I myself am ( finally ) going to see it this friday ! Woohoo ! In any case , the full report can be found here , including a huge set of information tables . <p> Communicator Needs YouChristian ( 12:26 pm CST ) A freelance journalist for the Star Trek Communicator magazine posted an announcement to the **25;1033;TOOLONG newsgroup a few hours ago . She 's currently working on a few articles , and she needs help . She 'd like to hear from you if : <p> You are in a profession that noone would associate with being a Trekker as well i.e - doctor , lawyer , accountant etc etc . I need to know all about your job and how it relates , if at all , to Trek , as well as what you do that 's Trek related - clubs , conventions , etc . <p> Or did you meet your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear from those who found romance through Trek , so tell me your story . <p> Or has Star Trek inspired you to be an engineer , docotor etc ? Was Bones the most profound influence on your life . <p> If any of these descriptions fit you , and you want to talk to her , you can reach the journalist ( ' Johhanne ' ) by e-mailing her . <p> Guys , if your girlfriends put up with Seven of Nine , the least you can do is return the favor and get us all Star Trek Insurrection 12 " Riker figures . He 's wearing the new dress uniform which looks like a Love Boat castoff , and he looks more like Jonathan Frakes than the 9 " action figure , plus he comes with those essential masculine accessories , the computer padd and laser rifle . If you would prefer to bond with your loved one on Valentine 's Day , try the Trek blooper video or one of the Trek novels . They 're not as sexy as reading Exit To Eden aloud ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way ) , but if you do a good Sisko imitation , it might come close . <p> There 's more to be found in full article , including advice for ladies ( Seven of Nine t-shirts seem to be the hot gift this year ) , and a paragraph on the lovely Star Trek Alien Beanies . Be warned , though , some of the links in the article were n't working for me , and some of the items ( such as the very romantic Trek blooper video ) were unavailable . <p> No Oscars For InsurrectionChristian ( 11:37 am CST ) Cinescape On-line just reported that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have announced the Oscar nominees ( I 'm sure other sources reported it as well , but Cinescape is where I saw it . ) Naturally , Steven Spielberg 's Saving Private Ryan got a lot of nominations , 11 in total , but unfortunately Insurrection was n't nonimated for any award at all - not even the Visual Effects award .

Of course , this affects our public transportation system as well , and I can understand that .

In case you 're interested , you can find his official fanclub , the EPIC ( Ethan Phillips Internation ( fan ) Club ) right here . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 10:14 am CST ) Sorry for the slow start , everyone . I do n't think this news update will go as fast as usual - I 'm currently doubletasking between this news update and a live chat with wonderful pop group Roxette . From 5 PM to 7 PM CET they 're chatting at the Official ' Have a nice day ! ' site ( ' Have a Nice Day ! ' being the title of their new brilliant album ) . I 'll try to at least get some news out , but I 'm not making any promises : - ) . <p> Sunday February 7 , 1999 <p> New at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually accessible for all of you out there yet , but I 'm so excited about this that I 'll just tell you a little bit about it . Here at Trekzone.net we 'll soon be opening a lovely Java chat room . Since the chat rooms at Startrekker.net went down , the Trek community has n't had access to a decent chat room anymore , but we 're going to change all that ! Our new client , which allows you to chat via both Java *and* regular IRC clients are scheduled to go live very soon indeed ..... <p> These five episodes have shown new hope for Voyager . While few episodes aired in direct correllation to last year , a few comparisons show Voyager beginning to improve over last year 's mark . In addition , almost all episodes in this period held or improved the season average to-date . <p> -At the risk of repeating myself , these two months have provided a myriad of good signs for Voyager , which has been cruising downhill for the past four years . The show leveled off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show may begin to rise . Where the show could only surpass a 4.0 rating with a gimmick a few months ago , Voyager has begun to hit the 4.0 mark quite regularly . December and January have provided some stability and rebound , giving hope that maybe February Sweeps could see more of the same . If Voyager 's current trend extends through February Sweeps , Star Trek will have its first year of Sweeps increase since TNG ended its run five years ago . <p> The full report , which also includes the actual figures themselves , can be found here . <p> Wildside Press HelpChristian ( 9:39 am CST ) Today seems to be a good day for Trek book news , as John Gregory Betancourt ( author of ' The Heart Of The Warrior ' ) has sent news of a contest to the Wildside Press mailing list : <p> We are putting in a ( free ) book auction -- it costs nothing to bid or list items for sale -- and we desperately need help to really " kick the tires " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need a lot of fake items posted and fake bids made fast .

Responding to this , someone asked John on his Q&amp;A Board what other special editions would be coming up , and here 's his answer : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YESTERDAY SAGA by Ann Crispin Yesterday 's Son Time for Yesterday FORTUNES OF WAR by Diane Carey Dreadnought ! Battlestations ! WORLDS APART by John M. Ford The Final Reflection How Much for Just the Planet ?

The preview goes into some detail about the game 's roots in the Starfleet Battles tabletop game and is accompanied by a huge load of screenshots . In general the preview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Although we 're only goofing around with a pre-alpha , we still could n't help but be stunned by the visuals in Starfleet Command . Planets that spin and grow huge as you get closer to them , nebulae , and other craft are all displayed with fantastic crispness and smooth animation . Another nice artistic touch are the interface screens , which match the race with which you are playing the game . They do an excellent job of making each race seem really different rather than just another set of space ships . Be sure to check out all the screens we put up . They show the huge amount of variety and detail available in the game . Then reflect on the fact that these guys are n't even close to finished . <p> The preview goes on to mention that there will be another preview on tuesday , in which IGN will look at some gameplay issues and which will also feature an interview with the designers . Thanks to Evil Avatar for reporting this . <p> Toy NewsChristian ( 8:51 am CST ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 9-inch scale figures that will be made available for general release , as opposed to the retailer exclusives that have been announced before . <p> The 9 " Millenium Collector Sets each feature a Captain and his or her First Officer in dress uniforms .

These 9 " figures are battle damaged versions of a couple of your favorites aliens , a Klingon Warrior and one very mean looking Borg Drone .

Presumably it 's a Swedish Star Trek club , but I 'd love it if someone from Sweden would be able to give me a more detailed description . -Lastly , the Barbie Borg made me laugh . A lot . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 8:22 am CST ) Today I was busy adding extra sites to Trekseek.com , specifically to the Fan Clubs section .

If you win , you and a friend will fly to Vegas , where you 'll be treated to a six-day stay in the Hilton Hotel . Of course , you 'll also get to visit the Star Trek Experience during your stay . <p> All you have to do to win this is answer three easy questions , enter your address and wait anxiously . The contest can be found here , but remember that it 's probably only open for Dutch people . ( Haha ! Finally we get revenge for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senad Music for telling me about this . <p> This is n't so much recent news as it is timely trivia given current events , however it 's interesting to note that Abdullah Bin Hussein , Crown Prince and likely imminent King of Jordan once appeared on Voyager in a cameo appearance . Prince Abdullah is a self declared fan of Star Trek and appeared in the second season episode " Investigations " . He can be seen briefly in the opening of that episode , talking with Ensign Kim in a corridor . <p> This certainly alleviates my fears about Abdullah . I mean , if he likes Star Trek , he can hardly be a dictator , right : - ) ? <p> Airing mid- February will be a spectacular television event , an epic Star Trek : Voyager two hour telefilm that marks the television debut of the evil Borg Queen , the central node in the vast Borg group mind seen previously in Paramount Pictures blockbuster movie " Star Trek : First Contact .

But there 's a softer side to Russ ' music , and now his fans do n't even have to be in Southern California to share it . <p> STAR TREK : CONTINUUM visitors are among the first to be able to order Russ ' four-song CD of acoustic and ballads , entitled Only a Dream in Rio . <p> The full article contains a picture of the cd cover , plus , of course , information on how to order the cd . <p> WARNING !

As you probably know , ' The Secret of Vulcan Fury ' was an adventure game that was being developed by Interplay , which ironically enough also uses the motto ' By Gamers , For Gamers . ' Last October , Interplay announced that the game 's development had been put ' on hold ' , which everyone assumed meant the game had actually been canned . However , it seems there may still be hope for the game : <p> Its fate is still uncertain - however , Interplay has scheduled to re-evaluate this project in the springtime to decide whether it is to be cancelled completely or continued . In order to help them make the decision to continue development , Games Domain Review has created this petition to allow the gamers to show their support . Since the earliest Interplay had indicated they would be able to re-evaluate the game was in mid-March , the deadline on this petition is March 10 . <p> Trek Sweep StuntsChristian ( 9:31 am CST ) I was actually going to post this yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this week 's ' Sci-Fi Hot List ' column at TV Guide the February ratings sweep month is looked at . Many sci-fi shows are doing something extra during this month to attract extra viewers , and of course DS9 and Voyager are doing this as well . Deep Space Nine 's most important ratings cannon in February will be the episode ' Fields of Fire ' , which premieres on the 10th . A short teaser of what can be expected from the episode : <p> As Ezri Dax , deBoer encounters a previous Trill host in " Field of Fire , " which premieres in syndication Feb. 10 . Joran , one of Dax 's earlier incarnations , comes to Ezri in a dream and confesses to a murder . At Joran 's urging , Ezri channels his memories to help solve the recent murder of a young Starfleet officer . The psychic sleuthing hits a snag , however , when Ezri awakens to news of a second homicide . <p> Meanwhile , Voyager is depending mostly on the upcoming telefilm ' Dark Frontier ' , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In case you have been living in the closet for the past month , this is the two-hour episode that features the return of the Borg Queen . <p> " Fans have been clamoring to see the Borg Queen again ever since First Contact , " Ryan told Jeanne Wolf in a recent TVGO interview . Playing Seven 's relationships with the collective and with Voyager 's Capt . Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) against each other , says Ryan , makes for " this neat little triangle . It 's almost like meeting your birth mother and your adoptive mother . " <p> ' Dark Frontier ' will air on wednesday the 17th of February at 9 PM ET on UPN .

A short excerpt from the DS9 review <p> A less-dark voyage to the other side than the past few alternate universe stories , this was also one of the more enjoyable Ferengi stories of the past few seasons . It makes TOTAL sense that Zek , the man who wanted to buy his way into the Dominion and to bribe the Bajoran prophets , would attempt to cross over looking for new markets ; it 's also predictable though rather sad that he would cheat on Moogie with the Intendant , a woman no one seems to be able to resist even though they all know better . I was puzzled about Quark 's admission of familial loyalty to the Nagus - now THAT sounds like an alternate universe version of the character - and more so about Ezri 's familiarity with Ferengi on our side , considering that as far as we know , she 's never crossed over , and Ferengi are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:35 am CST ) -Tonight , the SciFi Channel is broadcasting ' Operation : Annihilate !

Christian ( 8:16 am CST ) This morning , I saw one of those annoying Tell Sell programs on television . This particular program dealt with a new ' fast reading ' course - within 4 hours you ( yes , you ! ) would know how to read at speeds previously unimaginable . The inventor of the course was supposedly able to read through an entire mathematics book in just 22 seconds .

And it has always been in the back of my mind . I met Bill Birnes , the author of many cookbooks ... and he said , it would be fun to do this . And we just started messing around with ideas and this is what popped out . I wrote all of the Voyager sections , and anything to do with our crew . I wrote all the introductions , as well .

@@58304060 @7304060/ <h> The Enemy Within <p> Plot Summary : After an unknown ore damages the transporter , it begins to sever everything it beams up in two . In the case of inanimate objects like thermal heaters , the duplication prevents the equipment from working , but in the case of an alien animal , it creates a docile , friendly pet and a rabid , biting creature . When Captain Kirk transports aboard , unaware of the problem , he is split into an intellectually stable yet indecisive man and a libidinous , violent one . Spock and McCoy become aware of the division after the " evil " Kirk takes brandy from sickbay and sexually assaults Yeoman Rand . The " good " Kirk has difficulty withstanding the pressures of command , and although it is relatively easy for the crew to find and subdue the irrational Kirk , McCoy fears that any attempt to reintegrate the two halves with a possibly malfunctioning transporter could kill him .

While watching with my family , one of my sons said , " That 's what happened to Lex Luthor on Smallville when he got split into Good Lex and Bad Lex , " and the other said , " That 's what happened to Duncan on Highlander when he had that dark Quickening , " and I tried to think of all the other subsequent shows that had done something very similar .

Why does n't the ship send a shuttle to pick up the away team ? Why ca n't they beam down more blankets and tents - how can a blanket get split into positive and negative components ? Such questions are never addressed , and while Kirk has the excuse of having his psyche shattered for failing to think of alternate solutions to the immediate crisis , the rest of the crew seems to be thinking just as sluggishly . Not that that really matters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kirk , even though it 's atypically externalized . Even Spock and McCoy are mostly foils for this private struggle , in the developing roles that they will play throughout the series , with Spock offering a cool , analytical approach to the situation while McCoy passionately argues the probable human cost . In many ways that division is too simplistic , just as it is too simplistic to describe Kirk 's two beings as " good " and " evil " when as Kirk himself learns the i 'd and superego are interdependent . The viewer identifies Evil Kirk by the fact that he twitches and leers when he beams up , whereas Good Kirk stumbles to his quarters and dismisses a friendly Rand without looking at her or the crew manifest she offers him . Evil Kirk , who 's almost too stupid to be believed , goes to sickbay to obtain the means to get drunk and then goes to Rand 's quarters , ignoring her scream and struggle when he touches her . <p> In one of the more amusing moments of the episode , Spock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rand 's allegations : " We have an impostor aboard . " Given that there are probably a hundred other explanations , many of which involve a schizophrenic Kirk and a dermal regenerator to cover up Rand 's scratches - something the impostor does n't think to find , though we know they exist since McCoy heals an injured crewman in seconds - I find it utterly charming that Spock immediately assumes Kirk must be innocent , even before they become aware of the transporter malfunction that subsequently splits the horned dog . Spock then declares to a wavering Kirk that they can not tell the crew that the " impostor " is in fact a part of Kirk , warning that the crew will lose faith in a captain who appears less than perfect , and Kirk says he does n't know how he forgot that . It 's a somewhat unnerving moment , since Rand has just explained that she did n't know what to do when Kirk attacked her with the declaration that he was the captain . " I did n't want to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captaincy confers perfection is associated with Kirk 's dark side , not his intellect : it 's the evil twin who shouts that he 's Kirk when he hears the announcement that all crewmembers must seek an impostor looking like the captain , and it 's the evil twin who gives himself away on the bridge shouting that the ship is his . <p> Twice Good Kirk tries to persuade Evil Kirk that they need one another , and twice he fails : first in Engineering , saying , " You ca n't hurt me . You ca n't kill me . Do n't you understand ? I 'm part of you , " just before Spock demonstrates the Vulcan neck pinch on the double , and again in sickbay , trying to calm the panicked and restrained Kirk by telling him that he can master his emotions with his mind .

Apparently Kirk 's charm is part of his dark side , for he manages to persuade Rand to see him later , then holds the bridge until McCoy arrives with the other Kirk . It 's Spock who puts the labels " good " and " evil " on these characters , claiming that he 's using Earth terms , though he is the first to articulate that Kirk 's " negative " side makes him strong when it 's properly disciplined . McCoy tries to argue that intellect should trump raw power , but even Good Kirk does n't believe that and McCoy eventually admits that while he hates to agree with Spock , it 's true that Kirk 's command forcefulness lies mostly in his evil twin . <p> Kirk sits and sulks in the same room where Spock went to cry in " The Naked Time " , answering a call from Sulu and becoming ever more despondent about his impotence to save the landing party .

" Spock will plead in " The Devil in the Dark " when Kirk 's life is at risk by a nearly extinct creature that Kirk believes means him no harm ) . But this is not just a theory to Spock , as he explains : " I have a human half as well as an alien half , submerged , constantly at war . " His intellect forces them to live together , and he insists that Kirk can force his two halves to make a whole as well - something that the confused and terrified animal could not do . <p> When it 's over , and the landing party that sat out in 117 below zero temperatures proves to have nothing worse than frostbite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that no man should ever see .

" Kirk may have seen a side of himself that no one would wish to see , but he does n't seem all that concerned about his ability to master that side , nor is he compelled to apologize for it .

Yet the notion that everyone is made up of light and dark aspects , violent and peaceful , passive and aggressive , emotional and logical , masculine and feminine , passionate and reasonable , yin and yang if you wish , recurs throughout the series and on in to the films , when Kirk insists that God can not be God and use his powers for evil at the same time .

I can cite " The Enemy Within " as a perfect example of one of the reasons K/S appeals to me as a female viewer : That last scene between Spock and Rand would be absolutely intolerable if I took it at face value . Rand , a professional on the crew , is very nearly raped by the captain 's libidinous half , and deeply shaken by the attempt : we see her crying , shaking , with her normally immaculate makeup running .

Certainly one could write that off as a case of overidentification - Spock has already explained the warring halves of his own personality - but then how to explain the specifically flirtatious element of his query ? I reject outright the notion that Spock is the sort of man who 'd suggest that Rand should have enjoyed an attempted violation , which means that Spock himself must find it titillating .

@@58304062 @7304062/ <h> The Measure of a Man <p> Plot Summary : Commander Bruce Maddox comes aboard the Enterprise during a visit to the new Starbase 173 with transfer orders for Data , whom he intends to disassemble in order to produce more androids for Starfleet . Data has serious reservations both because Maddox does not believe that an android is a sentient being and because he does not believe that Maddox has the skill to preserve his memories and consciousness . When Philipa Louvois , the Judge Advocate General who presided over his court martial after the loss of the Stargazer , suggests that Data 's only option may be to resign , Data leaves Starfleet , but Maddox files a complaint stating that Data is not an individual but the property of Starfleet , just like the Enterprise computer . Louvois rules that the law favors Maddox 's position the Federation and insists that in order to hold a hearing without a full staff , Picard will have to defend Data while Riker prosecutes the case . Forced to accept the position to avoid a summary ruling , Riker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and argues that he was created to serve human needs . Devastated by Riker 's performance , Picard tells Guinan of his certainty that he will be defeated , to which she suggests that maybe that 's for the best - the Federation can create an entire race of disposable people to do dangerous or undesirable work . Understanding that calling an intelligent being " property " is a euphemism for slavery , Picard insists that Data is no more property than children are the property of their parents and he should have the same right of self-determination . Louvois rules that while Data may be a machine , she does not have the authority to decide whether he has a soul , and he is free to make his own choices in life to discover that for himself . <p> Analysis : One of the best episodes not only of The Next Generation but in all of Star Trek , " The Measure of a Man " distills all the things that make this series matter : seeking out new life and new civilizations , cherishing diversity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship ( or , where friendship is not possible , cooperation ) , overcoming fears and keeping a sense of humor through it all . The story picks up where " Elementary , Dear Data " and " The Schizoid Man " each left off - the one leaving hanging the question of the rights of a sentient construct , the other honing in on the question of whether Data 's rights are equivalent to those of a human . As Guinan makes explicit to Picard , that question is so much bigger than the rights of Data , or Moriarty , or - to extrapolate into Star Trek 's future - a series of emergency medical holograms . Maddox frames his project in terms of the greater moral good , creating additional androids to assist and protect humans from danger . Picard mentions that he has sent humans into danger as great as that which Maddox proposes for Data . Expendable people , Guinan suggests calmly , would make such dilemmas go away ; Starfleet would have an entire race of beings at its disposal , conveniently labeled property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This dialogue is subtle and brilliant , though the same might be said for Melinda M. Snodgrass 's entire screenplay ... in fact , the only overdone element of the episode is the score , which ominously underscores Maddox 's straightforward statement of his plans . The Associate Chair of Robotics at the Daystrom Institute needs no assistance to come off as a terrifying villain ; Data has greater power against a bat'leth or Borg nanites than being called by the pronoun " it . " This is not just a story about big ideas but the smallest details of characterization and relationships . Take Riker , for instance , whose competitive nature gets put through a full workout . We see him at the very beginning hosting a poker tournament , bluffing his way past Data 's expertise about the game ( " It makes very little sense to bet when you can not win . " " But I did win . I was betting that you would n't call " ) . Forced to take on a role he makes it very clear he does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to frown immediately as he realizes the implications of showing his weaknesses in the courtroom . He gives a brilliant performance in the role of prosecutor , then sits and rubs his face , smiling in genuine relief and pleasure when Picard gives the stronger argument and then avoiding the celebration because he feels guilty , until Data points out that Riker 's taking on the unpleasant role " injured you and saved me . " Riker 's usual sounding board , Troi , is nowhere to be seen and in this rare instance that works to the character 's advantage ; he must knuckle down on his feelings and choose his priorities , as he will do on several later occasions under pressure to take his own command . <p> There are dozens of lovely little character moments . Wesley looks with concern at Data on the bridge when Maddox first appears , making it clear without a word of dialogue that he is more attuned to Data 's responses than most of the more mature officers who call him a friend . Pulaski , who a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status as a full-fledged person , plays poker with him and is among the circle of friends at his farewell party . LaForge spends his time at that party moping at the unfairness of Maddox 's scheme and sorry that his friend will be leaving . Picard finally reveals an attraction to a fully-fleshed-out woman with a life of her own , not a nurturer but a onetime adversary , and their biting exchanges add wit and color to what might otherwise be the drab procedural scenes necessary to set up the fireworks of the hearing . ( I 'm a huge fan of stickler-for-detail Philippa Louvois , whose seeming drawbacks as a judge advocate end up becoming her greatest strengths and Data 's salvation ... plus she 's the only character we 've met so far who 'd tell Picard to his face that he 's both a pompous ass and a damn sexy man . ) Even Maddox , who 's very difficult to like , is wonderfully characterized and well-acted : his admiration of Data is tainted because he 's threatened by Data 's intelligence , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reproduce Soong 's work or even articulate a theory of how he might do so , he keeps a tight lid on his anger and responds to a question about whether he likes Data by saying tightly that he does n't know " it " well enough to say . <p> But this is Data 's episode , and although he does n't get much opportunity to explore his trademark offbeat humor beyond the opening bit , it 's one of his finest hours . Whereas he becomes only a bit discombobulated over losing a poker hand , he looks distinctly uncomfortable in Maddox 's presence and when he learns of the scientist 's plans , he comes close to losing his cool . He is willing to concede that Maddox 's research has intriguing potential , but he tells Picard flat-out that he will not submit to it , and when Picard says that there are Starfleet interests to consider , Data retorts that if LaForge 's VISOR allows him to see better than human eyes , it would make sense for Starfleet to require all its officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't recall ever seeing Picard look so ashamed of himself . When Maddox barges into Data 's quarters uninvited , Data is calm but clearly annoyed about it , an ineffable quality very much like the details of memory that Data wants to preserve as something integral to himself . He seems determined to prove something when he stops trying to preserve the wrapping paper on Worf 's gift and , at Wesley 's prodding , rips and crumples it . He smiles when his hologram of Tasha Yar does the same , he saves his medals even before Picard emphasizes their importance by having his awards read in court ( a moving nod to the original series ' " Court Martial " when it was Kirk in the chair ) . Riker can remove Data 's hand and turn him off , but Pinocchio ca n't be broken so easily . He 's already a real boy . <p> And this is Picard 's episode as well , one of his most memorable and emotional appearances . At first it is inconceivable to him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious fact that Data has rights that must be protected . Then his first officer and friend gives a chilling performance at the hearing , and his confidence is shattered . Rather than either of his usual confidants , Riker and Troi , he talks to Guinan , who carefully nudges him to a different perspective , allowing him to work out the argument for himself . When he says that she 's talking about slavery , she says breezily , " I think that 's a little harsh . " The dynamic is fantastic , very different than with Louvois , who believes that overt sentimentality is not one of Jean-Luc 's failings and mocks his passion over a machine ( " Then Data is a toaster ! " ) . But Guinan is just as determined to get in her points . And she 's completely confident that once Picard looks at the bigger equation , he 'll come out ahead at the hearing , and he 'll also never make the mistake again of allowing an easy euphemism to obscure exploitation . It 's a classic moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain of the Enterprise , is a sentient being ; it 's an even more classic moment when , after flipping around Riker 's opening question about what Data is ( an android , an automaton , a machine ... a sentient being ) , Picard points at Data , cites Starfleet 's founding principle to seek out new life and announces , " Well , there it sits . Waiting . " <p> It 's a resolution worth waiting for ... Louvois looking a bit ashamed , admitting that she struggles with the metaphysical issues brought up by the hearing but certain that Data deserves the same right to struggle with them , and Maddox finally seeing Data as a " he " rather than an " it . " There 's no real need for proof of Data 's individuality but he provides it anyway , first being generous to Maddox , then to Riker . There is n't any big declaration of gratitude to Picard , and I 'm sure Picard would agree that there should n't be , when he 's arguing something so fundamental . Well done indeed .

Discovering that they are also infected , the team beams down to the planet and meets Captain Ron Tracey , who tells them that the planet offers natural immunity and that the peaceful Kohm village in which he lives is under attack by the violent Yangs . Kirk discovers that Tracey has used his phaser to affect the balance of power on the planet , and when Tracey demands more phasers from the Enterprise , Kirk formally arrests him , accusing him of violating the Prime Directive . Tracey , who believes that the virus infecting them might hold the key to longevity like that of the Kohms , wants McCoy to isolate a serum that will give humans longer lifespans and justify his interference .

In the Yang stronghold , Kirk and Spock discover that they are on a parallel Earth following a Third World War won by the Communists - the Kohms - and that the Yankees , the Yangs , have hidden away as a sacred text the US Constitution . When Kirk demonstrates not only that he can defeat Tracey in single combat but that he can recite the words , the Yangs agree to heed his message of freedom , and the crew finds it can return to the ship , having been cured by exposure to the planet 's atmosphere . <p> Analysis : Because of the last fifteen minutes , " The Omega Glory " must be classed as one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever , but until it falls completely apart , it 's rather enjoyable in a campy , superficial way . This is the only episode I can think of where Kirk gets knocked out not once but twice and by both sides of the conflict , and William Shatner plays his scenes with a sour , grumpy expression as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has degenerated into the nonsense at the end when Kirk attempts to make a case for truth , justice and the American way . Tracey 's character is written as so over-the-top crazy that Shatner can emote to his heart 's content and Kirk still seems calm and rational . <p> That said , the episode does n't start badly ; there 's a crisis with another starship , a rescue mission in which Kirk learns ( or should learn ) the hazards of beaming both the captain and first officer into a potentially hazardous situation , the catastrophic discovery there ( very well-paced , letting the audience begin to guess that those salt crystals are the crew bodies before McCoy confirms it ) , the realization that the Enterprise crew could share the same fate , the beamdown into the middle of what appears to be a public execution and the discovery that Captain Tracey controls the events and has used his phaser in front of the natives . Tracey seems surprisingly stable for a man who has lost his entire crew - compared to Matt Decker , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , as the landing party is taken prisoner and told they can never leave the planet . <p> Tracey needs McCoy 's help isolating the agent that has allowed the Kohms to live for centuries , so he ca n't kill Kirk and Spock outright , but he can use their lives as bargaining chips , and can use Spock and McCoy to keep Kirk from trying to inform his crew of what 's going on . McCoy makes it look as if he 's going along with Tracey 's plan - he is genuinely curious about the virus that has trapped them on the planet - but he 's not afraid of his powerful Kohm guard and is ready to knock him out if he gets a chance . Sulu picks up on the fact that there 's trouble and refuses to cooperate with Tracey 's demands through Kirk for more weapons . <p> But it 's not clear what triggers Sulu 's suspicions , and the episode begins to degenerate once Kirk discovers that the savage Yangs use " freedom " as a worship word .

We hear that there are thousands upon thousands of Yangs massing for an attack on the Kohm village - which does indeed seem peaceful and stable , and Tracey 's initial decision to ally himself with them does n't seem that much more outrageous than Kirk threatening to blow up Eminiar 7 or destroying Landru . He has to be portrayed as mad for power and wealth as well as having exercised the bad judgment of using phasers to shoot Yangs , but it 's still hard for me to judge him as harshly as Kirk does given his ongoing sympathy for John Gill after the stuff he pulled on Ekos - Tracey 's wish to cure all human disease still seems relatively sane compared to a history professor making himself Fuhrer . <p> And then there 's the distorted playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in by the Yangs , Cloud William 's near-unbearable reading of the E Plebnista and Kirk 's even worse reading of the Preamble to the US Constitution ( I can excuse Shatner 's awkwardness somewhat with the words - having been raised in Canada , he did n't have to memorize it in grade school like I did - but the fist-waving is a little much under any circumstances ) . As if the rah-rah patriotism is n't enough , Tracey drags God into the proceedings , insisting that Kirk is the Evil One and everyone can tell from Spock 's pointed ears ( fortunately the Holy Bible is also a sacred text of the Yangs , though not in the same place of honor as the E Plebnista ) . It 's frankly embarrassing - the single combat so that good can defeat evil ( though it allows McCoy to utter the great line about how evil often wins unless good is very careful ) , the symbols of American patriotic glory without any sense that the Yangs understand any better after Kirk 's speech what they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of the Kohms as communists except racially ... there 's an icky racism in play in which the " Americans " are ethnically white Anglo-Saxon in appearance . The American-born actors on Star Trek are a lot more diverse than that ! <p> " The Omega Glory " seems derived from several previous episodes , and the timing of its airing is particularly unfortunate because it follows those of which it is most reminiscent . The crew of the Exeter has been reduced to essential body elements without water , which it turns out has been caused by a genetically engineered disease that has greatly increased life expectancy for the survivors . The latter storyline is very reminiscent of the one from " Miri " , and the bodies being reduced to chemicals is a lot like what the Kelvans did so recently in " By Any Other Name " , turning crewmembers into hexagonal forms composed of their essential elements and brain patterns . But the bigger problem is that " The Omega Glory " is a parallel Earth storyline of the sort that Spock said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the odds of a replica of Nazi Germany developing on its own right down to the uniforms was infinitesimal . <p> In " The Omega Glory " , we 're asked to buy a parallel Earth so perfect that the same Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence , which would be fine if we got some explanation of how these Yangs and Kohms came to be there -- did they leave our Earth at some point in a secret launch like Khan 's and establish rival bases on this planet from which they fought World War III ? Is this entirely a parallel universe the Enterprise has somehow discovered ? There 's no explanation whatsoever , which renders everything very silly . There are some entertaining scenes , but given the overall quality of Star Trek 's second season , there 's also a lot in " The Omega Glory " that 's inexplicable , even inexcusable.

Anyway , it does n't matter very much , because the Universal Translator erases what should be an enormous barrier to establishing peaceful relations with suspicious alien cultures , namely a means of communication . In a way , we see in " Darmok " how utterly dependent Starfleet officers have become upon their magical technobabble device . Picard seems at first to believe that speaking his usual message loudly and clearly will be sufficient to open a dialogue ; no wonder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which would seem either to refer to someone ' babbling or to tell that person to freeze so someone else can speak . Troi senses no hostility from the Tamarians , yet she has no useful suggestions for dealing with their befuddlement , like providing an illustration that might suggest peaceful intent - I would think that a culture of bipeds who use knives as weapons would understand photos of people laying down arms together , or people harvesting and exchanging crops together . Picard does n't even attempt to use sign language . <p> Because he lacks the crutch of the translator , Picard is unprepared to find himself abruptly beamed to the surface with the alien captain , and responds much like Kirk did when he found himself on the planet with the Gorn - he assumes Dathon wants to fight him in a one-on-one struggle for superiority , which is what Worf , too , believes must be what the Tamarians intend .

The Enterprise does n't even seem to have a linguist on staff , considering that Troi and Data are sent to find clues in the cryptic Tamarian phrases uttered on the viewscreen . They manage to link up Darmok and Tenagra via computer records , and Troi then guesses that they 're being offered a glimpse into Tamarian mythology , yet she seems mystified how they might use that information to offer a new approach to the Tamarians . <p> It 's unclear whether the Tamarians have only a limited vocabulary of myths or whether Dathon purposefully sticks to the same few in the hope that Picard will catch on , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picard is obviously beginning to pick up on the meaning before the beast attacks , and his frustration at not being able to make the leap to full communication is palpable . Terrific acting on the part of both Patrick Stewart and Paul Winfield make the scenes on the planet unforgettable , despite an energy monster who 's not one of the effects department 's best . Winfield 's performance is a big reason some of the seemingly inane phrases are so compelling : while it seems at first that " Shaka , when the walls fell " might be a reference to the removal of a psychological or communications barrier like the one Dathon and Picard are trying to dismantle between their cultures , Dathon 's evident unhappiness when he says the phrase suggests instead that it refers to a literal collapse , a disaster .

What 's more remarkable , I think , is that the audience learns to understand Tamarian right along with Picard , and it 's believable as a language .

Starfleet may not know these aliens , and may find " Mirab , his sails unfurled " to be an awkward phrase for " Prepare to depart , warp factor whatever is standard for this Tamarian phrase , " yet " Darmok " makes clear that this is a sophisticated culture whose nuances will take many years to unravel , with much learning along the way - not just the technology that Federation planets generally share , but a wealth of history and literature .

That 's sort of like the unspoken word between Uhura and Spock . <p> " I feel that this break-up that Uhura and Spock have is amazing because she fell in love with her teacher .

The shuttle is caught in gravometric shear and a risky emergency beamout is performed , damaging the Doctor 's portable emitter . Torres and Engineer Mulcahy set up a diagnostic in a science lab and go to bed , but when the Doctor wakes Torres and then interrupts her shower to inquire about the state of the emitter , she sends Mulcahy in to discover that the emitter has interfaced with the ship 's computer . A Borg-like tube shoots out of the emitter , penetrating his neck . In her regeneration chamber , Seven 's Borg transceiver alerts her to the presence of Borg ; when she informs the bridge crew , they discover that the signal emanates from the science lab . <p> Seven , Tuvok , and a security team enter the lab to find Mulcahy unconscious and a variation on a Borg gestation chamber set up in the lab . Inside the chamber is a fetus with Mulcahy 's DNA and Seven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of its cerebral cortex . The 29th-century technology has interfaced with Seven 's nanoprobes , which contaminated it during the beam-out , and created a Borg unlike any Seven has ever seen before . It is growing at a greatly accelerated rate . Janeway refuses to terminate it , arguing that if the crew gives it purpose and individuality , they can keep it from the Collective , but Seven warns her that the drone has internal transporter nodes and other technological advances which make it highly dangerous . Janeway points out that the crew initially had similar fears about Seven herself , and orders the ex-Borg to instruct the drone in human behavior . <p> When Seven tries to interface with the activated drone , he demands a designation and hurts her . She resorts to using Borg data nodes to feed him information , which he accepts greedily , but he still wants a designation and information about the Borg . He has a hard time understanding her explanation that they are unique individuals , not part of the Collective . When the Doctor explains his origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident , and decides to help the crew , solving a difficult engineering problem for an initially hostile Torres . When Seven introduces him to Janeway , he tells her that his designation is One , and she congratulates him on becoming part of the crew so fast .

Seven is awakened by Janeway and the senior staff , who inform her that a Borg ship is on an intercept course . They fill One in on their experiences with the Borg . One wants to experience the mind of the hive , but when Janeway says , " No , you do n't , " he asks Seven whether she wishes to rejoin the Collective . Seven says that Voyager is her collective . One agrees to help defend against the long-range tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosting the phasers , but the Borg ship is too powerful ; it nearly destroys Voyager . In desperation , One beams over to the vessel and interfaces directly with the Borg technology , causing the ship to implode . <p> In the wreckage , Voyager finds One 's life signs and he is beamed to sickbay . But though his nanoprobes are regenerating , his biological matter is dying , and One refuses to let the Doctor attempt to repair him because his existence represents a threat to Voyager 's crew . Seven is distressed , but One tells her that his existence is an accident which puts them all at risk , and creates a forcefield around himself so that they can not operate . After his death , she goes to the cargo bay and regretfully turns off his equipment . <p> Analysis : <p> " Drone " was extraordinarily well-done , despite a smattering of inconsistencies with previous shows about the Borg . It 's easily my favorite Seven of Nine episode to date , and Jeri Ryan gave a moving and credible performance , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of every scene he was in . His walk and talk reminded me of the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz , which made him immediately sympathetic despite the Borg hardware ( smoother and sleeker than the Borg we 're used to , though I do n't understand how nanoprobes could have duplicated so much of the 29th-century materials in such a short time , nor why Seven said the Borg do not reproduce through fetal cultivation when we saw on TNG that they do ) . He made a convincing child despite looking older than Seven herself , and his farewell was emotionally charged though played with great restraint . <p> Science fiction shows seem to have a perverse obsession with turning women into mothers against their wills : they did it to Deanna Troi , they did it to Kira Nerys , they did it to Dana Scully , they did it to Xena 's Gabrielle , so I was really in dread of Seven of Nine 's maternal instincts . The show was blissfully restrained in that regard , too , though I was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with their " offspring . " The Doctor accepted the potentially permanent loss of his emitter with admirable grace after throwing a fit initially about its absence ( thus permitting a gratuitous shot of Roxann Dawson in her nightgown , and then topless ) . But I wonder whether we 're going to see him next week with the emitter back in place and no explanation of its recovery and decontamination ; the thought that they will have to cut it out of One 's skull is rather grisly . <p> In general this episode seemed a little rushed - it featured one of Trek 's patented instantly-maturing children , after all - and wasted a little too much time having Seven and One recite Borg cliches rather than engaging in dialogue which might have illuminated their growing rapport . But Janeway came across particularly strongly , which was very important after last week 's crisis of command - I like it when she takes risks with the ship in the name of new life , rather than out of some urge to look benevolent as in last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the captain from " Tuvix , " but that 's okay . I am always a little uncomfortable with how easily " human values " are substituted for Federation values on this series , but it worked here with the Borg collective ( and a ship which resembled the Borg queen 's ) as contrast . And Neelix was the most human of them all - a nice touch of character growth for a character who started out as comic relief .

Do you think Sirella is anything like the woman I thought I 'd marry ? She is a prideful , arrogant , mercurial woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste . And yet ... I love her deeply . We Klingons often tout our prowess in battle , our desire for glory and honour above all else ... but how hollow is the sound of victory without someone to share it with ? Honour gives little comfort to a man alone in his home ... and in his heart . " - General Martok , " You Are Cordially Invited " <p> Worf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leeta , Odo and Kira , or Ezri and Bashir . What Martok suggests in the quotation above is that neither Worf nor Jadzia really has any choice in the matter : they are destined to be together . " Not every relationship ends like a Klingon opera , " Dax says while vacationing on Risa . " No , " Worf replies . " Only the ones that matter . " <p> The Klingon and Trill may be destined to be together , but it 's hardly a match made in heaven . In fact , the gods do n't play a role in it at all . They ca n't , because their upstart Klingon creations killed them almost a millennia ago . The story of the creation of the Klingons and the death of the gods is even part of their wedding ceremony . Contrast this romantic outlook with a Bajoran such as Kira , who ended her relationship with Shakaar simply because the Prophets told her to do so . <p> Klingons are a deeply spiritual people . They have rituals for everything , as Quark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Places " . Yet Klingons are not religious , at least not in the Bajoran or Christian senses . In this respect they are closest to Federation humans who , by the twenty-fourth century , have also rid themselves of their gods . Unlike their Klingon allies , however , humans seem to have eliminated a lot of the spiritual aspects of their lives to boot . Roddenberry humans are non-religious rationalists . What , exactly , are Klingons ? <p> In Western culture , choice is a key ingredient in our matches . Odo and Kira choose to be together as a couple ( " His Way " ) , but they are also able to choose to be apart ( " What You Leave Behind " ) . Dax and Worf are incapable of making a similar choice ( " Change of Heart " ) . Rom must also choose to love Leeta ( " Doctor Bashir , I Presume " ) . Leeta 's need to have Rom actively choose even becomes a test of sorts : a challenge he must meet to win her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Martok 's method is that it takes romance completely out of the rational realm . Love , for him , and for Worf and Jadzia , is a matter of faith . The question on everyone 's lips at this point , I 'm sure , is : what would Friedrich Nietzsche make of all of this ? <p> Following in the tradition of Immanuel Kant , Nietzsche linked rationality with God . God , for them , was the ultimate perspective : absolute correctness . Kant reasoned that the ultimate goal of philosophy was to achieve the god's-eye-view ( ultimate knowledge ) , but that humanity , because of its faulted state ( thanks on the one hand to Eve 's love of apples , and to the irreconcilable void between the effable and the ineffable on the other ) , could never achieve this goal . Nietzsche went one step further and declared the god's-eye-view a useless goal . For God , you see , was dead . <p> " Have you not heard ? " Nietzsche asks in the introduction to Thus Spake Zarathustra . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We understand that , by God , Nietzsche means the ultimate or correct perspective . Without it , all things become possible , because all perspectives gain value . The rational , favoured mode of thought since the enlightenment , can no longer be seen as the only way of thinking . <p> So what does this leave us with ? There are other ways of knowing than with the head . There is , for instance , the heart . Martok 's view of love does n't make much rational sense : he describes his wife as " ... a prideful , arrogant , mercurial woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste " . Yet he loves her , and this is okay , since love does n't have to make rational sense . In some cases , love even supersedes rationality ( one might characterize this as a teleological suspension of the ethical ) . <p> Nietzsche would like Klingon society . Their gods are dead ( killed by their own hands ) , yet their spirituality lives on . Klingons live lives patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Shakespeare , tragic heroes challenge nature challenge the gods themselves and get punished soundly . Yet anyone who 's read Julius Caesar , Macbeth , or Hamlet , knows that the moment of challenge is the moment when the characters truly come to life . Consider George Costanza and his Frogger machine : the machine ends up smashed erasing his legendary high score but the moment he challenged fate , and tried to save the machine , he lived more fully than ... <p> Okay , I 'm getting a little silly , but you get the idea . Deep Space Nine explored several romantic relationships during its seven seminal years , and each one had its own parameters and issues ( heck , I still have issues with the Dukat/Winn romance ) . Ezri/Bashir , Kira/Odo , and Leeta/Rom strike me as very modern takes on romance . There is a rational aspect to each , and conscious choice plays a major role . Worf and Jadzia contrast these more traditional relationships by transcending choice and reason .

In many ways it can be more satisfying - and reading an anthology does n't get much more satisfying than the new collection Tales of the Dominion War . <p> Featuring stories from a wide range of popular authors , Tales of the Dominion War is one of this years must read titles . Edited by Keith R.A. DeCandido , this anthology gathers together twelve stories that span the Star Trek universe and provide for the reader a unique overview of the war and the fight to protect the Alpha quadrant from the overwhelming forces of the Dominion and their allies . <p> Michael Jan Friedman , Greg Cox , Keith DeCandido , Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz , Heather Jarman and Jeffrey Lang , David Mack , Dave Galanter , Howard Weinstein , Dayton Ward &amp; Kevin Dilmore , Robert Greenberger , Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin and Peter David all leave an impression as they take the reader on a journey to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also included at the end of the volume is a Dominion War timeline that takes into account not only on screen events but events established in the novels and short stories . <p> There are stories that illuminate events we know took place but we never got much detail on such as one of the pivotal moments of the war , the fall of Betazed . Keith R.A. DeCandido takes it upon himself to place the reader on Betazed when it falls under Dominion attack in " The Ceremony of Innocence is Drowned " . Through Lwaxana Troi we experience the lightening quick attack against an almost defenseless population . <p> Another crucial moment in the war is the Breen attack against Earth . Both " Eleven Hours Out " by Dave Galanter and Howard Weinstein 's " Safe Harbors " , a sweet little story that perfectly captures the camaraderie between Scotty and McCoy , tackle the Breen attack but from totally different perspectives . " Eleven Hours Out " , set on Earth during the attack , provides not only a vivid description of the destruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice character piece for Jean-Luc Picard . <p> In Star Trek : Nemesis we were introduced to a clone named Shinzon and told that he served the Romulan Empire with distinction during the Dominion War .

" Night of the Vulture " by Greg Cox has an entirely different tone . With a palpable sense of menace , Cox spins a tale that cleverly utilizes his unique storytelling gifts , the Jem'Hadar , and an old menace , the Beta XII-A entity . <p> " Blood Sacrifice " by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz takes us to Romulus where on the eve of the Romulans entry into the war Ambassador Spock finds himself trying to unravel the mysterious motivation behind the assassination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time that Heather Jarman and Jeffrey Lang have collaborated on a story . Based on " Mirror Eyes " I certainly look forward to anything else these two should cook up together . Told in first person , through the journal entries of a Tal Shiar agent working undercover on Deep Space 9 , " Mirror Eyes " is both riveting and poignant . <p> Some of the stories utilize literary-based characters such as " Field Expediency " by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore that features the crew of U.S.S. da Vinci from the Starfleet Corps Engineers series in a story that perfectly captures the spirit of that series . <p> In a nod to the Stargazer series " What Dreams May Come " by Michael Jan Friedman opens the volume with a story set early in the war where nothing is quite as it seems . Told from the perspective of Sejeel , a pampered Vorta who has been lulled into a sense of complacency , " What Dreams May Come " is classic Michael Jan Friedman . <p> Robert Greenberger 's " A Song Well Sung " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors tale while Peter David spins a fantastical New Frontier story , " Stone Cold Truths " , that only he could tell . <p> Rounding out the volume is the final story " Requital " by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels . Set concurrently with Deep Space Nine 's final episode " What You Leave Behind " , for me this story was the saddest and most difficult to read because you ca n't help but recognize the parallels to our own world . <p> It is not often that I read a story anthology and can honestly say that I enjoyed every one . I can say that about Tales of the Dominion War . Each and every story has something singular to offer . Do n't be surprised if when you finish this volume you find yourself compelled to start all over again .

At least , now that Enterprise has blown its wad , it ca n't revisit the gratuitous sex-and-violence of that storyline for several seasons ... unless , of course , the writers come up with more stupid excuses for making T'Pol act like a fan boy 's wet dream . <p> Let 's start with the Archer storyline , which is merely banal , and might actually have been entertaining if it were n't so reminiscent of " Canamar " ( and what were they thinking , doing two **30;1149;TOOLONG episodes in one calendar year ? ) Skalaar could shoot Archer at any time ; we hear over and over that he 'll get paid the same for a dead body as a live one , as long as it 's identifiable . So why in hell does he keep Archer alive , awake and talking ? <p> Well , obviously , because he 's one of those kidnappers with a heart of gold , who 's only shooting and abducting people because he was wronged himself , and all Archer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from himself to save his own skin . So he does he gets to witness firsthand the dysfunctional family and mistreatment at the hands of the Klingons that have led the poor Tellarite to become a thug at which point it 's easy to make a deal to stay alive . These are n't the nasties from the original Star Trek 's " Journey To Babel " , but more akin to the Pakleds , the " We Are Not Smart " guys from The Next Generation . <p> And then there 's T'POL IN HEAT ! I ca n't say I was n't warned , for UPN has been hyping this storyline in TV promos , in radio ads , on talk shows ... I 've lost track of how many times I was treated to the sight of Jolene Blalock slathering her lovely waxed legs with decon gel and rubbing her lovely bra-free breasts against a bemused-looking John Billingsley . To be fair , this episode did n't disgust me nearly as much as either of Voyager 's pon farr episodes , the date rape fantasy of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Soul " . It merely featured the expected exploitation of Blalock in extremely skimpy clothes , sweating , panting , rubbing herself all over a man who 's already declared himself turned off by forward women and another hidden behind a space-worthy environmental suit . Too bad she did n't challenge Malcolm with a lirpa ; I 'd love to see him try to pull off the James T. Kirk torn-shirt routine . <p> And what did we learn about T'Pol , the Vulcans , pon farr , sexuality ? Absolutely nothing ! But on a show with sexual politics that allow Tucker to make jokes about how belligerent Tellarites might want to meet his ex-girlfriend , and where Malcolm and Trip titter over T'Pol 's completely involuntary distress on the bridge , why expect anything else ? All right , I 'm not the target audience for this storyline . And fortunately I sent my ten-year-old the biggest Enterprise fan in my household to bed after " First Flight " . I 'll say this for UPN : at least they put " Bounty " in the 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I generally root for this show 's ratings to rise , but I 'm hoping UPN gets something close to the usual Wednesday night numbers in the slot from which Twilight Zone will officially be removed tomorrow when the fall schedule is revealed . But hey , at least now I can rest easy that I probably wo n't have to see another Vulcan mating episode for years . Maybe ever , if this show 's ratings do n't improve . I do n't think teenage masturbation fantasies about insatiable Vulcan women are going to convince anyone to watch Enterprise regularly . <p> Ca n't I say something nice about " Bounty " ? Why yes , I can ! The Tellarite makeup is terrific . And the Tellarite ship , though suspiciously familiar in interior design , is pretty cool . And Klingons ! Not only do we get pon farr , we get gratuitous use of Klingons ! Really , I should praise the continuity , because it 's nice to know the Klingons did not forgive and forget the Rura Penthe incident the way Archer seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But such stability seems so dreadfully wasted on an episode like this , which is boring the audience to tears with the derivative wrongful-imprisonment storyline before it ever gets around to showcasing a sweaty T'Pol.

The universal cries of " no ! " to the theme music showed how awful many fans thought it to be . For many , this was their first viewing of the show . <p> Then the main event arrived .

Sharp-tongued hostess Anne Robinson asked Denise Crosby ( Tasha Yar ) " So , you 're a model then ? " Denise answered that she was . Anne Robinson responded with : " And sometimes you even manage to keep your clothes on ? " This was a reference to Crosby 's appearance as a centrefold in Playboy . Picardo said that Crosby was so thrown by that question that it was edited out .

I really want to have the best of all worlds . I 've done a lot of theatre , as the lead role , and I 've just read for a part that I ca n't discuss right now .

By this time , I got my holo-emitter , and got to wander around the ship anyway . That was Brannon Braga 's idea , for which I 'm very grateful . <p> Question : What 's your favourite episode ? <p> Robert Picardo : I loved the episode where you saw what I was daydreaming ' Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy ' . One of my favourite scenes was where Janeway , Seven and B'Elanna were all fighting over me , and Kate Mulgrew put her hand on my bum , but sadly it was cut . <p> Question : What do you think of Enterprise ? <p> Robert Picardo : I hate the theme music ! I put my face in my hands when I first heard it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , epic pieces . I really wished they had got Jerry Goldsmith to score the song . <p> I know they wanted to get away from the Star Trek brand name , which is why they dropped it from the word Enterprise , to try and get in new viewers , who might have been put off by the name Star Trek - which is why they picked a contemporary piece of music , and dropped the space special effects from the intro sequence . <p> Question : I was watching Enterprise with my children , and the shower scene , with T'Pol and trip came on . I was very embarrassed - why 'd they do that ? <p> Robert Picardo : I agree . It 's shown at 8pm over in the States . It was completely unnecessary , and gratuitous . If they wanted to develop a future romantic relationship - that was no way of doing it . <p> The character of T'Pol , is also a suspicious copy of Seven .

@@58304158 @7304158/ <p> New Comics Q&amp;AChristian ( 4:57 pm CST ) Over at the Trek Nation , we 've got a new set of answers from comics editor Jeff Mariotte to all your comics-related questions . Take a look at one of them : <p> Query From : Jon Huff I wondered , in your list of writers you mentioned several people who had written Star Trek novels but who had not , to my knowledge , written any comics . I mention this because the Voyager series at Marvel had an author who was accomplished as a book author , but she did n't  seem to fully grasp that in comics you let the pictures do the setting up of the scene , not the words . This made the stories come off as a bit clunky in the dialouge department sometimes . <p> Also , a continued frustration of mine with Star Trek comics in general is that far too many writers limit what kind of stories they tell in order to " maintain the feel of Star Trek " when in fact the writers on the various TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories they want because of budgetary reasons . From the stories proposed so far , would you say we are going to see the Star Trek universe " expanded " or " opened up a bit " in the comics ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte Of the writers named in the initial release , I think the only one who has n't written any comics previously is Keith DeCandido . I 've seen his first script , and he has a very good understanding of the demands of the genre . He certainly has read comics for a long time , and his job as editor of the Marvel and WildStorm novels has kept him close to it . The other writers , even the ones who are primarily novelists , have all written comics . <p> And yes , part of what makes these comics cool is that there is no special effects budget to worry about . <p> Lots more interesting answers , plus an online form where you can submit your own questions to Jeff , can be found in the full update . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Koganuts ' Koga has sent in two reports about magazines which will soon feature Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) .

The cover article will deal with Raven 's ' Voyager : Elite Force ' game , which will also feature an appearance by Seven . <p> Secondly , the September 1999 issue of Playboy magazine features an interview with Jeri Ryan , accompanied by the same photo which appeared in Bikini Magazine earlier this year . Take a look at how the interview begins : <p> Jeri Ryan burst into television prominence by wearing a formfitting costume on Star Trek : Voyager that many male fans pray she 'll one day burst out of .

We asked Contributing Editor David Rensin to go where many men would love to go and meet with Ryan .

Whoever is interviewed , some interesting information on how Activision obtained the Trek license is given : <p> Apparently , there are is an abundance of Star Trek licenses being dished out by Paramount this year . How did you manage to grab the Star Trek Voyager title ? And how in god 's name did you get your hands on the Quake III engine so quickly ? <p> Activision has been negotiating with Paramount for quite some time to obtain the Star Trek license . They finally reached an agreement sometime late last year , therefore making it possible for Activision to create Star Trek based games . Activision , who owns Raven Software , approached us to create one of their first round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse group of Trek games and one idea was a first person shooter . Raven is familiar with making these types of games and our game Soldier of Fortune was progressing nicely so they offered the game to us and of course we gladly accepted . <p> We were n't sure at first what part of the ST universe we were going to make a game from but it did n't matter it is a rich universe full of possibilities . Eventually it was decided that we would make the game based on Voyager and we were even more excited because Voyager is away from known space leaving many open ended possibilities for the game . As far as acquiring Quake III , Activision is also involved with I 'd software and because Raven has worked with almost every I 'd engine in the past it only made sense to license the Technology again . All of these circumstances allowed us to get our hands on the engine right away . <p> More can be found in the full , rather in-depth interview .

Find it all here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mails published ! <p> Although the title of this book must have launched a thousand classic jokes , Spock Must Die ! actually deserves classic status , arguably aided by its melodramatic title .

I myself recently saw the book in a local bookstore for no less than 30 guilders ( $15 ) . While that is just a few dollars more than what we usually have to pay for Trek novels here , this time I passed - even I refuse to spend that much money on a book with just over a hundred pages . <p> Margaret Clark AnswersChristian ( 1:24 pm CST ) Pocket Books editor Margaret Clark has updated her Q&amp;A Board again , giving us all the latest inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Star Trek books .

" What we 're really trying to do with this game , " says Ian , " is to capture the hardcore Star Trek fan by offering them the chance to control space battles like they 've only seen briefly in the show , but we also think that we can get the RTS fan to go absolutely nuts over this .

As in the sixth season , the writers just refused to " shit or get off the pot " with respect to the Dominion War , allowing it to slip way too far into the background all too often . It would n't have required Karnak to predict the structure of this season , as it was practically identical to that of the sixth ( and the third , fourth , and fifth , for that matter ) : Dominion-heavy opening and closing episodes , a few others here and there , and assorted stories in between that in many cases blithely ignore the fact that the entire Alpha Quadrant is at war . <p> ... <p> This year 's great experiment , the ten-parter that closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a failure .

Christian ( 2:22 pm CST ) In just a short couple of hours , a new edition of the Trek Nation mailbag will be up ! Yeehaa : - ) ! <p> Sunday July 25 , 1999 <p> Berman 's Thoughts On Star TrekChristian ( 4:33 pm CST ) The New York Newsday has an interesting new article , written by Chris Kaltenbach . In it , several Big Names in the sci-fi world ( including Harlan Ellison , J. Michael Straczynski and and Majel Barrett-Roddenberyy ) talk about what should be done with the science-fiction genre to take it into the next milennium . The article also contains a short quote from Rick Berman : <p> Rick Berman , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sees nothing wrong with the franchise he 's been shepherding for over a decade . <p> " The franchise that Roddenberry created , the idea of a bunch of humans and others off on a journey of exploration , is something that is timeless , " he said . " It 's just a question of developing good stories and telling them . " <p> In the full article , Berman also ' pledges ' that Voyager will be around for at least another two seasons , and tells us that plans for a fifth Star Trek spinoff are still in the very early stages of development . The rest of the article is also very interesting , and offers a few good ideas on the road ahead for science-fiction television . Find it all here . Very major thanks go out to Dr. Lense for pointing me to this ! By the way - if , after reading the Newsday article , you feel the need to comment - please send in your thoughts to feedback@treknation.com so we can print them in the mailbag : - ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that a preliminary outline for the Voyager TM has been transmitted off to Pocket Books as of today , so this post is also a chance to see who 's paying attention . : ) The research into all ships ever seen on Voyager begins now . <p> Let 's hope this Technical Manual actually gets published - the DS9 Manual was fantastic , and I 'd love to see one for Voyager as well . The original message can hopefully be found here , though this link will presumably only work if you have a newsreader installed . Thanks go out to Adam Bailey for pointing me to this ! <p> DeForest Kelley To Receive AwardChristian ( 4:33 pm CST ) Some very good news here - the late DeForest Kelley , who starred as Leonard ' Bones ' McCoy , will soon be honoured for his work on Western movies and television shows : <p> DeForest Kelley , who died in June , never received an Emmy or an Oscar for his more than 30 years of performances as Dr. Leonard " Bones " McCoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is being honored for his earlier work in Western movies and television shows . <p> The Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund plans to grant its Golden Boot Award posthumously to Kelley at a ceremony on August 7 . The Golden Boot , established in 1982 , is considered the Academy Award of the Westerns , according to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund . <p> By receiving the Golden Boot , Kelley will join such stars as Gene Autry , Roy Rogers and Clint Eastwood , who have received the award in past years . <p> More on this can be found in the full report about this , which Admiral Scifi was kind enough to forward to me . <p> USA Buys Brooks/Lien MovieChristian ( 4:32 pm CST ) The new issue of Dateline : Starfleet contains the news item that the USA cable network has acquired the rights to air ' American History X. ' The film , which co-stars Avery Brooks ( Sisko ) and Jennifer Lien ( Kes ) will run in 2001 . Thanks go out to Adam Bailey for the lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene for an upcoming episode of Voyager ! The episode is called " Dragon 's Teeth . " Scarlett 's scene is with Ethan Philips . She was very happy to be working with Ethan Phillips again ! <p> The Scarlett Pomers site will be posting more info about Scarlett 's scenes soon , so then I 'll also report on it here . <p> Utopia Planitia 3 Mailing ListChristian ( 4:32 pm CST ) Charles Capps just sent in a news item about the Utopia Planitia 3 project , which has now opened a temporary placeholder site with some info on the project : <p> Utopia Planitia Three is a revival of the very popupar starship database of the same name , the backbone of the collection of sites known Behaviour 's STZone . UP and its ill-fated , overambitious sibling , UP2 , were taken down when the STZone broke apart on March 31 , 1999 . UP3 has been planned from the start to avoid all the situations that destroye UP and UP2 . We 're here to stay . <p> As of July 25 , 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rough estimate and will be changed according to need . <p> Currently , the site features a sign-up form for the Utopia 3 announcement list , which will keep you up to date on the site 's progress and which will even give you the chance to beta-test this project ! Find it all here ! <p> ' Voyager : Elite Force ' InterviewChristian ( 4:31 pm CST ) The people at Federation HQ , which is rapidly turning into one of the best Star Trek gaming sites , have put up a new Q&amp;A with Raven 's Chris Foster and Mike Gummelt , talking about their upcoming ' Voyager : Elite Force ' game . The interview is spread over six pages , and includes some news on what parts of Voyager will be included in the game : <p> Federation HQ : Can you tell us how much of Voyager itself has been/will be modeled ? Can you walk around the entire ship ? Is it possible for you to interact with the ship 's primary systems , or are the computer consoles mere decoration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Voyager that will be visited in the course of the player 's missions on the ship . These areas include : the Bridge ( including the Captain 's Ready Room and Conference Room ) , Astrometrics , Engineering , The Mess hall and Neelix 's kitchen , Transporter Rooms , the Shuttlebay , Sickbay and a few other areas that the player may visit if he wishes to . The player will have the freedom to wander the halls while traveling the and from these areas , however . <p> As far as interacting with the ship 's systems , the player will be able to access a number of different consoles throughout the ship , but only for information gathering purposes . He will be able to get Mission information , his current location as well as other status reports , but he ca n't , say , power down the Warp Core if he fells like it . <p> The full Q&amp;A contains info on the game 's characters , puzzles and storyline , and even includes three new screenshots of the game . <p> Community Profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned this in yesterday 's ' Hello World ! ' already , but now it 's finally here - the first installment of the Trek Nation Community Profile ! In this weekly series , Amy Hightower will be interviewing leading figures from the online Trek community , so that you will finally get to know the people behind all your favourite sites ! This week , she 's interviewed David Henderson , founder of Trek resource site Psi Phi . Take a look at a very short excerpt from the interview : <p> What exactly does maintaining Psi Phi involve ? How big a chunk does it take out of your life ? <p> I do n't know that I can really say how much time it takes ; a good portion of time is spent in searching other Star Trek sites , filtering out information from rumors , separating believable rumors from unbelievable ones , and figuring out what to include at Psi Phi and what not to . <p> All in all , I 'd say an average of ten hours a week are spent on Psi Phi-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers ( June-August ) . <p> In the full interview , David talks about everything from Paramount 's visits to Psi Phi to his opinions on current Star Trek to the history of his site - find it all here ! After that , please send in your comments to feedback@treknation.com - we 're only just starting this series , and we 'd more than love to get your input on how we can improve it ! Lastly , major thanks should of course go out to Amy Hightower for actually taking on the whole Community Profile series - it is more than appreciated : - ) . <p> ' Trekkies ' VHS &amp; DVD ReleaseChristian ( 5:14 pm CST ) Apparently , the ' Trekkies ' domestic VHS and DVD release date is the 5th of November . No dates for a possible overseas release have been determined yet . Thanks go out to David Henderson for sending this in , who in turn got the info from ' Trekkies ' fan Gabriel Koerner . <p> Raleigh Convention ReportChristian ( 5:07 pm CST ) Over at the Nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this report , Kathryn Keeter and Bette Llewellyn tell us all about the recent Slanted Fedora convention in Raleigh , North Carolina . The event was attended by four TOS cast members , including Walter Koenig and George Takei : <p> Then Walter and George were on--and I mean " ON " ! At my present age of forty-(mumble) I 've seen showmanship , but these guys know how to work a crowd ! Walter was playing straight man to George , but he got some deadly zingers in ! I do n't know which stories are cliches and which are new , but the audience had a great time . George brought up the subject of a Captain Sulu series several times , but I got the impression that this was more a running joke than anything else . Walter hopes to do plenty of stage roles in the future , amoung other work . When asked about future Star Trek spinoffs , George said he 's heard the rumor of a " Star Academy 90210 " type show , which would be dreadfull.George also plugged his web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , very interesting report ! Major thanks go out to Kathryn and Bette for writing this and , again , I 'd also love to receive convention reports from more people in the future : - ) . <p> ' Double Helix : Vectors ' ReviewChristian ( 5:00 pm CST ) After their review of ' Double Helix : Infection ' review about a week ago , IGN SciFi have now posted a review of the second novel in the series , ' Vectors . ' The book was written by Kristyn Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith , while the review was written by Andrew Davidson . Davidson is n't that positive about the novel , to say the least : <p> With two authors , character development should not have been a problem . However , with three high-ranking doctors , an anti-fraternal Ferengi , and a kingly Cardassian there is n't much room for more than shallow dialogue . The focus , Dr. Pulaski , plays a major role , but she does little more than work on the killer virus , which is basically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solutions to the crucial issues all come within the same chapter as the development of the issues themselves , giving readers with short attention spans pleasure , but frustrating those who favor a little plot development . As with the first novel , this installment could easily be translated to the television screen , although writing like this has brought once-great shows ( read : Deep Space Nine ) to their knees . <p> Although the main characters and location changed , not much else is new in this stale novel . The authors take too many directions with too many characters to give this book distinctive character or flavor . Vectors is as stiff and inflexible as the Cardassian characters contained within its covers . <p> For everyone who is concerned , and they should be , I 'd like to clarify that I am a Native American . Mexico is a nation of Mestizos , people who are half indigenous and half European . Any Sociologist or anthropologist will tell you that we are indeed Indians . Not all Indians have feathers and war paint , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. border . <p> As people are apparently still asking this question , Block gives a detailed explanation of the Native Americans , and then especially the ones from Mexico . Find it all here . <p> Kate Mulgrew Kennedy ConnectionChristian ( 4:57 pm CST ) According to a report Cleveland Live , there is a very minor connection between Kate Mulgrew ( Kathryn Janeway ) and the recent John F. Kennedy Jr . tragedy . Apparently , Mulgrew and her husband , Ohio Democrat Tim Hogan were to be guests at Rory Kennedy 's wedding . Hagan had only met John Kennedy a few times , but he was rather close to Robert Kennedy 's children . More on this can be found here . Thanks go out to Star Trek News for the link . <p> The second season premiere of UPN 's Dilbert will feature the voice of Jeri Ryan as the aforementioned talking Seven clock . In the episode , Dilbert encounters his long lost father , Dadbert ( voiced by guest star Buck Henry ) . No word as to how the alarm clock figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... The Dilbert premiere is set to air on UPN October 5 . <p> Kym Pantlin asks : What does your wife/girlfriend think about Tom and B'lana 's relationship on the set and what does she think about you playing in that relationship ? <p> Robert Duncan McNeill : She knows Roxann and she knows Roxann 's husband , who might beat me up , so she feels pretty comfortable about it . He rides a Harley like I do so I do n't want to test it . I think Voyager will get back to the Alpha Quadrant in the spin off called Tom Paris in space ... or the adventures of Capt . Proton . We 're bouncing around several titles . Just kidding . <p> Clint Williams asks : Robert , I 'm a huge fan . I love the combo of angst and attitude that Paris displays . Being a follically challenged individual , I was wondering , and please do n't be offended , but is that a hair piece you wear on Voyager . Your hair seems to have changed . <p> Robert Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put so much hairspray and products on my hair that it might as well be . It takes on a life of its own . They use a lot of product on my hair and it 's been the subject of many heated debates over the years . I think the style I have now on the show is more in line with what I 'd like Paris to have instead of the more bouffant version . <p> Starfleet Command Bonus CD NewsChristian ( 4:55 pm CST ) Interplay 's Chris Taylor has given out a bit more info on the contents of the Starfleet Command bonus CD , which will include special missions and the tools to create custom missions . When asked if these things would be made available to people who did n't pre-order , he said the following : <p> We 'll probably release the missions and the mission scripting code at a later date . Maybe free download , maybe in an expansion disc ... Just du n no at this time . No guarantees , no idea of how it will be delivered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that . The other contents of the bonus disc will not be made available to the general public . <p> In my opinion , Interplay should definitely release the scripting code for free - that 's an integral part of making the game succeed . This is especially bad for non-US Starfleet Command fans , who are not able to pre-order from Interplay . You can find Taylor 's original post here . Thanks go out to the Starfleet Universe for this . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 4:54 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Looking For par'Mach In All The Wrong Places ' tomorrow at 16:00 BST . An hour later , they 'll be showing Voyager 's ' Future 's End , Part One . ' This might well be the last UK ' Today On TV ' for a while , btw - tomorrow is the last day still listed at the Collective . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 4:52 pm CST ) There is nothing more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right after returning from having had a great day . It 's even worse when you 've just bought a great new book and are dying to read it - you 'd think that would cause me to hurry up with TrekToday , but instead it seems to cause my attention to drift away all the time . Tomorrow 's update should be somewhat earlier again : - ) . <p> Friday July 23 , 1999 <p> New Comics Q&amp;AChristian ( 3:53 pm CST ) At his Q&amp;A Board over at the Nation , comics editor Jeff Mariotte has once again answered several fan questions . Take a look at one of them : <p> Query From : Tammy I do n't understand why new publishers always want to get new people to create TREK books when the sales were higher with great fan support in the days that DC and Malibu did the books . It seems arrogant to keep throwing out the baby with the bathwater--especially when the newer creators today are n't usually all that skilled . It takes time to learn to draw the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially like to see the best guys like Peter David , Jerome K. Moore and Gordon Purcell back doing the good TREK material again.It 's like never hiring Spielberg again ' cause he 's already directed a bunch of movies . Would n't it be better to use the best people out there , along with a few new guys ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte I understand your argument -- and I have never said we would never use those guys -- but part of our goal is obviously to do our own thing with the Star Trek license . We do n't want to just do what others have done , not because that was bad but because we strive for originality and because we want to put our own stamp on things . That said , I disagree that new writers and artists ca n't do just as good as those who 've come before . Many of the writers we have working on the line are very skilled and popular science fiction writers , some of whom , like Nathan Archer and Kristine Kathryn Rusch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience writing Star Trek . Give these people , and the new ( to Star Trek ) artists we 'll be using a chance to show that they can do it before you decide they ca n't . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised . <p> Trek Composer Chat TranscriptChristian ( 3:47 pm CST ) At the Sci-Fi Channel , they 've put up a transcript of a chat with Alexander Courage , Dennis McCarthy and Don Davis , Star Trek composers . In the chat , they of course also talked about their Star Trek music , as you can read here . Thanks go out to David Henderson for pointing me to this . <p> Robert Duncan McNeill Chat ReportChristian ( 3:41 pm CST ) Yesterday , the official Continuum organised a live chat with Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) . While a transcript is n't yet up , here is my own small report of the most important things he said in the chat : <p> He arrived about 30 minutes late because he was still shooting a scene . They were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed by Rick Kolbe . <p> He does n't think the Tom Paris / B'Elanna Torres relationship is going to end . " I think that they tried to get away from it being a soapopera thing , but I do n't think they 're getting away from it . We 're still very active physically , so I do n't think we have any problems there . " <p> About going back to the Alpha Quadrant - " I do n't know what 's going to happen for a fact but my instinct is that we 'll make it back by the end of next year which will be the end of the series . " <p> On directing - " Yeah , I 'd love to direct more but there 's a long line for that though . Directing Voyager is more exhausting than acting in it . " <p> His independent film " The Battery " is not for sale , because he promised the actors ( who all did volunteer work ) not to make any profit on it - they 're going to show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will presumably be posted here in a few days from now . <p> Rick Berman On **25;1181;TOOLONG ( 3:40 pm CST ) Greg Braxton and Brian Lowry at the Los Angeles Times have written an article about the lack of ethnic diversity in new series premiering this fall on the major networks . The article contains quotes from several important people in the television industry , including Star Trek 's own Rick Berman : <p> Rick Berman , executive producer of the " Star Trek " -themed series " Voyager , " " The Next Generation " and " Deep Space Nine , " said multiculturalism was a mandate of " Star Trek " creator Gene Roddenberry , who broke ground in that regard when he introduced the original Enterprise crew in 1966 . <p> " When I first came into this franchise 12 years ago , I knew I was getting involved with something that was based on a vision of the future that had cultural diversity as a tent pole , " Berman said . " Carrying on in that tradition was a natural progression for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest of the creative staff should be commended , it is indeed this - just like it was a great decision to go with a female captain . Find more about this issue in the full article . Thanks go out to Richard Rafter and Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for sending this in . <p> ' Roswell ' Series DetailsChristian ( 3:40 pm CST ) Christopher Allan Smith at Eon has written a new feature looking at the upcoming WB series ' Roswell , ' which will be produced by Jonathan Frakes ( William T. Riker ) . In the article , Frakes also comments on some recent Trek happenings , including the departure of Ron D. Moore from Voyager : <p> " I think it 's STAR TREK 's loss , frankly , " Frakes says . " Ron Moore brought commitment , intelligence , professionalism and more specifically -- because I 've done a lot of shows with him -- a real understanding of who the Klingons are , who the Vulcans are , and how the characters relate . I 'm a huge Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , but it 's STAR TREK 's loss in a big way . " <p> The other big TREK news has been the rumors that only some of THE NEXT GENERATION cast might return for the next big screen installment . Frakes discounts those rumors immediately and is far more optimistic than what we were initially led to believe . " I think everybody will be back , " he says . " Without a doubt . I do n't think we 're breaking this company up . " <p> The actual article can be found via Eon 's What 's New page . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for pointing me to this . <p> Starfleet Command Bonus CDChristian ( 3:38 pm CST ) Interplay 's Erik Bethke has announced the contents of the Starfleet Command Bonus CD , which will be packaged with every copy of the strategy game ordered directly from Interplay : <p> Other random bits of cool stuff Chris Taylor has collected for this CD ... <p> The full post can be found here . Something I do wonder about - does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you order directly from Interplay ? That would certainly classify as a Bad Idea to me . In any case , thanks go out to the Starfleet Universe for the lead . <p> Decipher Buys FASAChristian ( 3:38 pm CST ) Decipher , the publisher of the official Star Trek Customizable Card Game , has announced that it will be taking over FASA , the role-playing game publisher . Several decades ago , FASA also published a Star Trek role-playing game , which added a lot of background information to the Star Trek universe . Decipher 's official press release regarding the takeover can be found here . <p> Dr. McCoy And The MugatoChristian ( 3:37 pm CST ) The new issue of Eon Magazine contains a review of two new 12 " action figures - the Classic series Dr. McCoy figures and the Mugato . Reviewer Jeff Bond is the most positive about McCoy : <p> The McCoy doll features an excellent likeness of the young Deforest Kelley ( around " The Corbomite Maneuver " era ) and comes with the usual equipment of tricorder , communicator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 9-inch TREK figures are actually close to the correct size for the 12 inch figures ) . McCoy 's uniform shirt , unlike Spock 's almost corrugated , sea blue version , is a smooth-textured light blue that looks closer to what was seen on the actual series . <p> New ' Armada ' ScreenshotsChristian ( 3:37 pm CST ) Gamespot has posted ten new screenshots of Activision 's upcoming real-time strategy game ' Star Trek : Armada , ' more than doubling the amount of screenshots currently available . The screenshots can be found here . <p> Paramount Emmy Press ReleasesChristian ( 3:37 pm CST ) I wonder what the management people at Paramount are thinking - first they fail to promote Deep Space Nine well enough to get any important Emmy nominations , and now they 've published two press releases in which they tell the world about the hairstyling , art direction , makeup and visual effects nominations which Voyager and Deep Space Nine did manage to secure . A press release is available for Voyager ( still listing Jeri Taylor as exec producer ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast member ) . <p> Happy BirthdaysChristian ( 3:36 pm CST ) Today is the 61st birthday of Ronny Cox , who guest starred as Captain Jellico in TNG 's ' Chain of Command . ' Yesterday was the 65th birthday of Louise Fletcher , better known as Kai Winn . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:36 pm CST ) -According to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective , British Star Trek fans who have Sky One will be able to see DS9 's ' The Ship ' tomorrow at 16:00 BST . An hour later they 'll be able to see Voyager 's ' The Swarm . ' <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:35 pm CST ) Tomorrow we 'll be starting a new and extremely interesting article series over at the Trek Nation - the Community Profile . In this weekly series , Amy Hightower will be interviewing well-known figures from the online Star Trek community , beginning with Psi Phi'sDavid Henderson . Look for the article sometime on Saturday morning ! <p> Thursday July 22 , 1999 <p> Garrett Wang Upcoming MoviesChristian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather interesting news item that Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) will be starring in two upcoming films , according to the Internet Movie Database . The first one is the drama ' Ivory Tower ' , where he will appear as Mark Burton . The second one is the horror film Piranha , for which his role is not yet known . Thanks go out to Anne for sending this in ! <p> Why Cuss dumped Kneelicks . This is one of those questions skillfully avoided by the show - one episode they were together , all of a sudden she 'd dumped him ! Although maybe the real question should be why she stayed with him so long ! <p> Worf As Ambassador In TNG NovelChristian ( 2:59 pm CST ) Some exciting news today - if all goes well , we 'll soon be able to bring you a special interview with Keith R.A. DeCandido , who 's currently writing the TNG comic mini-series ' Perchance to Dream , ' as was recently announced in WildStorm 's press release . However , it turns out Keith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation Ambassador to the Klingons : <p> It 's a TNG novel , but it 's really a Worf novel . It takes place after ' What You Leave Behind ... ' and details Worf 's first mission as Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire -- and the Enterprise-E does show up in it . <p> The plot involves a conquered Klingon world that is rebelling against the empire -- and originally asked for Federation help when the alliance between the empire and the UFP was broken ( between ' The Way of the Warrior ' and ' By Inferno 's Light ' ) . Worf has to find a solution to the crisis that will keep the Federation , the Klingons , and the locals happy . <p> This definitely sounds like an interesting novel ! Hopefully we 'll hear more about this novel , the ' Perchance to Dream ' mini-series and Keith 's other work once we do the interview ! <p> Well , I honestly find it hard to believe I 've been doing this job for two years now . But I find it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not the work itself I 'm talking about , it 's being here to chat and email and basically just share cyberspace with my fellow Star Trek fans . <p> You wan na know the truth ? You guys are a really fascinating bunch . And I 'm in a great position to watch you all , and learn all your little secrets . Heh heh . <p> The actual secrets are n't quite as dirty as this introduction makes it sound , but the full article still is a very interesting read . <p> In case some of you have run into problems finding high-quality games that have been spun-off from STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION , your search is hereby over ! I 've played some cool strategy games in my time , but STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION : BIRTH of the FEDERATION takes number one on my list . Now , personally , I 'm not a very big fan of Microprose 's STAR TREK game line , strictly because of their high demand on the performance of the computer system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ready to take the game back to the store , when I installed it . But when I did , I was transported from my computer directly into the Star Trek universe like never before ! <p> In the full preview , Fleisher describes the game 's races , tactical sequences , and empire-building elements . <p> ' Men Cry Bullets ' Release DateChristian ( 2:58 pm CST ) The official Jeri Lynn Ryan fan club is reporting that ' Men Cry Bullets , ' the feature film debut of Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) will be coming to theatres on the 27th of August . A few months ago , the fan club described the movie as " a tragic comedy that uses gender reversal to demonstrate the insidiousness of an abusive relationship . " <p> Blaze of Glory expansion will release August 11 or 18 , 1999 . The expansion is being printed and will now go through the **32;1208;TOOLONG process . We 'll soon know which day it is .

A full explanation of precisely what these cards are can be found here . <p> ' Double Helix : Infection ' Book ReviewChristian ( 2:57 pm CST ) Andrew Davidson at the recently re-launched IGN Sci-Fi ( previously the Daily Sci-Fi ) has written a review of ' Double Helix : Infection ' - the first book in Pocket Books ' six-novel crossover series for this year . Davidson is somewhat positive about the novel : <p> Perhaps the best aspect of Infection is that it reads much like any episode of Star Trek : TNG . Author John Gregory Betancourt fills the 226 pages with enjoyable moments strung together in a sequence that is easy to read and is almost ready for conversion to the television screen . The characters in Infection follow the traits demonstrated by the actors of the TV series ( Worf 's uneasiness around women and propensity for Klingon machismo , Data 's comic attempts at humanity ) in a way that satisfies TNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the TV series , Infection is good entertainment for a lazy afternoon . <p> ' Course : Oblivion ' Overnight RatingsChristian ( 2:57 pm CST ) Yesterday 's repeat showing of Voyager 's ' Course : Oblivion ' scored a 2.8 rating / 3 share , which is 0.7 ratings points up from last week . ' Seven Days , ' which aired on UPN an hour before Voyager , scored a 2.5 rating / 4 share . As usual , the shows on the other five networks performed better than UPN 's shows . <p> Robert Duncan McNeill ChatChristian ( 2:57 pm CST ) Tonight at 06:30pm Pacific Time , Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) will be attending a live chat at the official Continuum . The chat will begin at 06:30pm Pacific Time , though advance questions can already be submitted .

' Hairstyling ! ' and ' Art Direction ! ' Oh yes , those are a lot more fitting for Deep Space Nine 's ending than , oh , ' Best Drama Series ' or ' Best Dramatic Performance ' or something equally insignificant . Great job , Paramount , really ! <p> Interestingly , William Shatner ( James T. Kirk ) was nominated in the ' Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series ' for his guest role on ' Third Rock from the Sun ' as Big Giant Head . The full listing can be found here , while the official site of the Emmys also includes info on precisely which people working on Star Trek were nominated . <p> Avery Brooks On ' BET Tonight'Christian ( 2:56 pm CST ) A new article from the Entertainment Wire mentions that the NAACP ( an equal-rights organisation for coloured people ) has bought stock in the four major networks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in prime-time television programming . The NAACP made this announcement on ' BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley , ' a talk show on the cable network Black Entertainment Television . According to the full article , Avery Brooks will be making an appearance on this show on Wednesday , the 28th of July . The show is shown at 11:00pm Eastern Time and 8:00pm Pacific Time , so make sure you do n't miss Brooks ! <p> The final rating for last week 's Voyager episode is in , and Voyager did a lot better than I thought it would ! Voyager 's final rating was a 1.7 and nr. 108 . UPN 's highest-rated show was " Malcolm &amp; Eddie " and " Moesha " with a 2.0 ! <p> Hmm . It 's been a long time since there last were two other UPN shows with higher Voyager ratings . <p> Columbia Commander A Trek FanChristian ( 2:56 pm CST ) Reuters ' Brad Liston has written a story about the launch of the Space Shuttle Colombia , which was called off for a second time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit about the celebrities present , but also includes a short biography of Eileen Collins , who will be the first female commander of a space mission . In the bio , it is mentioned that " Collins , an Air Force colonel , wife and mother , grew up in Elmira , New York , watching Star Trek and Lost in Space . " Nichelle Nichols ( Uhura ) served as recruiter for NASA for a long time - it is not at all unlikely that that Collins was made enthusiastic for this by Nichols ' efforts . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 2:56 pm CST ) -At 7:00pm Eastern Time , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the second-season TOS comedy ' A Piece of the Action .

Take a look at some of the active threads : <p> I was watching Voyager the other day and I found myself wishing that I was part of their journey . Imagine the exciting things that would happen all the time ! Contact with aliens , observing the universe up close , never knowing what happens next . I even focussed on the less esoteric parts of life on the Federation Starship Voyager . Ability seen as the determining factor for a position rather than age , sex , family connections or race . I noted the respect for other cultures and the effort put into preserving their distinctiveness and the reluctance to initiate violence . <p> The more I thought about it , my wish was n't simply , Gee I wish I had a life just like they have on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society was driven by the ideals and goals that govern the world of Star Trek .

The adaptation will star Patrick Stewart ( Jean-Luc Picard ) and Gregory Peck as members of a prominent ranch family in Texas : <p> Although a final copy of the script has not been sent to TNT executives , it has been said that this version is set to take place during the Mexican revolt in the mid-1800s in Texas . No further casting has been confirmed . Stewart is set to produce Boss Lear with Robert Halmi Sr. , chairman-producer of Hallmark Entertainment .

Apparently , they recently attended a UPN party for tv critics , where they decided to question a few stars from the network about their choices for the upcoming presidential elections . Besides wrestlers ' Big Boss Man ' and ' The Big Show , ' they also asked Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) what she thought : <p> Svelte Star Trek : Voyager star Jeri Ryan admits that she 's only recently started following the race for the White House .

The number one spot was occupied by Mechwarrior 3 , followed closely by two Star Wars titles , but Microprose 's ' Star Trek TNG : Birth of the Federation ' still managed to secure itself an honourable 14th place . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:08 pm CST ) -Tonight at 9:00pm , UPN will be repeating Voyager 's ' Course : Oblivion , ' which first aired on the 3rd of March . Take a look at how the official Continuum describes the episode : <p> Lieutenants Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres tie the knot but their holographic honeymoon is cut short by a phenomenon that breaks down the U.S.S.

This week we 're already able to present you with the 4th installment of our series of articles , looking at the current state of the Star Trek franchise and its future . This week 's installment was written by Julia Houston , Star Trek Guide at About.com , and is a lot more positive than the previous articles : <p> Let us all stare into the unknowable future without putting on our blinders or lamenting things before they 've actually left us . Let 's anticipate new surprises as possible sources of future joys and be happy in the knowledge that Star Trek currently makes a honkin ' mountain of cool cash . And let 's remember that our personal views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor , thanks to syndication , can they ever be made to disappear ... even if that Paris/Neelix love child turns out to be none other than Wesley Crusher ! <p> I attended both days of the sfedora con in Raleigh this past weekend . I think the " retirement " confusion comes from the phrasing of the mailers that were sent out before the con . Dave Scott and the guests were more specific at the event--that they will not be appearing AS A FOURSOME after their contracts for this tour are completed . All four of the classic Trek guests were very clear that they would keep doing work and appearances . <p> I live in Nottingham , UK , and today ( Monday July 19 ) Andrew Robinson ( Garak ) was in town at the city 's Forbidden Planet SF store . He 's on a promotional tour to publicise the When You Leave Behind novelisation . <p> I had the briefest possible word with him and asked him whether he thought it was the last time we 'd see the DS9 characters on screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play Garak again and would hate to think I never will , " was the gist of what he said . He said his favourite episodes were The Wire and Improbable Cause/The Die Is Cast and that In The Pale Moonlight was a great episode and great for Garak . <p> Very major thanks go out to Sean for sending in this report ! <p> Margaret Clark AnswersChristian ( 3:09 pm CST ) Even though he 's extremely active at his Q&amp;A Board , John Ordover certainly is not the only editor at Pocket Books . Margaret Clark just updated her board as well , and provided lots of interesting answers : <p> Query from : Captain Jim What is New Worlds , New Civilizations ? <p> Response from : Margaret Clark New Worlds , New Civlizations is a journey across the galaxy .

Those who dared to play the same deck they 'd used at Origins found a pack of players ready to counter them . The Space-Time Portal mass-reporting strategy favored weeks ago was shot down on several occasions by Scorched Hand and armadas . Q-bypass was used by only a handful players , and each faced a swarm of Hide and Seeks , Q2s , and other defenses . <p> Perhaps influenced by David Bowling 's success at Origins , Borg Ship dilemma hunting was the most popular strategy in the Wizard World invitational . Klingon , Romulan , Cardassian -- even a Federation deck built around the strategy appeared . Two players , Mike Harrington and Kris Sonsteby , even went so far as to play absolutely identical Klingon Borg Hunting decks . It was just one sign that Klingons are fast moving to challenge the Federation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ChatChristian ( 3:08 pm CST ) This Thursday , Robert Duncan McNeill will be attending a live chat at the official Continuum .

Ward at IGN PC has written a new preview of ' Insurrection , ' Activision 's new adventure game based on the movie . The preview also contains some info on the game 's backstory : <p> Here 's the setup you are Ensign Sovok , a human raised on the planet Vulcan , and a generic crew member on board the U.S.S. Enterprise . The story takes place about nine months after the events of the original film ( if you have n't seen it , I 'm not about to ruin it for you ) . As the game begins , you are assigned to be Captain Picard 's shuttle pilot on a mission back to the surface of Ba'Ku . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , things get a little screwed up and you find yourself a key player in the familiar Next Generation team 's efforts to stop a Romulan plan to take this powerful planet for their own . <p> " This is the Star Trek game where you get to play out the fantasy of being in a Star Trek episode , " explains Jonathan Knight , Star Trek : Insurrection 's Executive Producer , " ... you 'll get a chance to explore the origin of this mysterious planet from the film . " <p> New Starfleet Command ScreenshotsChristian ( 3:08 pm CST ) Gamespot has made ten new Starfleet Command screenshots available , which they took from the latest version of the beta . The screenshots apparently show all the different races , and are completely new . You can find them here , together with some info on the game . <p> UPN NewsChristian ( 3:07 pm CST ) Yesterday , Viacom reported its second-quarter results , and held a meeting with analysts to discuss the results .

At a session of the Television Critics Association summer tour in Pasadena , Valentine told writers who criticized UPN 's decision that maybe there was a " disconnect between you guys and the people who watch " wrestling . <p> UPN is planning to air matches staged by the WWF , more raucous than Ted Turner 's WCW , whose matches air on Time Warner 's TNT channel . When reporters noted that the WWF has been criticized for bloody violence , obscene gestures and language , and overall " schlock , " Valentine responded , " I do n't think it 's schlock . If you really look at the statistics , demographically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more upscale . I think there 's a disconnect between what most people over 20 or 25 think of wrestling and what your children and their children really see in it . " <p> Thanks go out to Jeff ' Koganuts ' Koga for that bit of info . Lastly , the TV Guide web site has a quote from Brandy Norwood , who says UPN will have to come up with more money if they want her series ' Moesha ' to continue . Norwood 's contract ends this season . <p> -Tomorrow , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Body Parts ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST .

Christian ( 2:54 pm CST ) This weekend 's Slanted Fedora Star Trek convention in Raleigh is now getting lots of coverage by the mainstream media , after promoter Dave Scott said the event would be the last appearance by one of the Original cast members . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , while Studio Briefing also mentions it . Meanwhile , and that 's actually the main reason for this post , I 'm beginning to wonder if this is n't just a cheap publicity stunt by Dave Scott - both Walter Koening and James Doohan said they wanted to go on visiting conventions after Raleigh , and it is well known that George Takei is n't planning to give them up . Unless Nichelle Nichols wants to stop doing them , we 'll probably still be able to meet all of them . <p> Update : Interestingly , Byron Amick just provided me with a link to the Slanted Fedora site , which also includes a list of upcoming conventions . One of the events announced there is a convention in Des Moines in November , which will feature appearances by .... George Takei , James Doohan , Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig ! At least we now know that the buzz by the organiser about the Raleigh convention being their last one simply was not true - let 's hope there 'll also be more cons after Des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a new week , and a new round of answers from Jeff Mariotte , editor of the Star Trek comics line .

Did you see all the episodes to prepare you for this job ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte I have n't watched every episode , but I 've seen a lot of them . My background is in science fiction -- I 've been a science fiction bookseller for almost 20 years , and still co-own a store even while working in the comics biz . I 've also written science fiction , and I know many of the professional writers in the field . That background , combined with much of a lifetime 's worth growing up with Star Trek , and lots and lots of research ( yes , I 've read just about every reference book at this point ) got me ready for the Star Trek part of the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole job -- you also have to know how to edit comic books . <p> Find more in the actual update , where you 'll also be able to ask questions yourself . <p> Yeoman 's Personal Log , Stardate 8130.3Our captain just finished delivering a hasty briefing to the crew . I 'm not sure if it was a pep talk , or an epitaph . Enterprise is already badly damaged from Khan 's surprise attack with the Reliant , a capable Federation New Light Cruiser . To take us out of immediate danger , the Enterprise is limping into the obfuscating gasses of the Mutara nebula . Once we enter , shields will be only minimally functional , and all weapon systems will have to be placed on manual targeting , reducing their accuracy . It 's the only chance we 've got to get away from Khan 's punishing attack , however , and everyone has faith in the captain . <p> Be sure to check your local listings for a more accurate time .

Every Monday , Fred Shedian will be giving you his weekly ' Take on Trek , ' offering his thoughts on how Star Trek should progress . This week , he asks the producers to take Trek ' back to basics : ' <p> Here we sit , debating about a legacy that Paramount , Berman , and Bragga should uphold . Perhaps it is time for us to get back to our roots . The " Outpost " idea was good for a while , but had to be modified to bring in the exploration aspect . " Lost in Space " is interesting , but boring . " Dawson 's Creek " and " Melrose Place " are not what Star Trek is about , so why even open that can of worms ? " Star Wars " and " Trek Wars " have been done over the past two years , and many people are sick of that . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Sounds like an interesting idea . It 's been done twice before with unprecedented success . We know it 's a hit that appeals to the people of the twentieth century . Maybe we should prepare to introduce it to the twenty-first ? <p> On ' Insurrection ' Game NameChristian ( 2:52 pm CST ) Minor , but interesting news item . Activision recently announced that it would be re-titling its ' Insurrection ' adventure game to ' Hidden Evil ' - here 's what Laird Malamed , the Star Trek brand manager at Activision had to say about this : <p> We changed the name to clearly distinguish it from the story of the movie . There was some confusion if the game was the same story as the movie ( which it is n't - it 's the sequel ) . Star Trek : Insurrection will still be a part of the packaging . <p> A lot of interesting info on the game can still be found in the Trek Nation 's interview with the designers of the ' Insurrection ' game . <p> German Airdate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News ( which I 'd like rather a lot more if they 'd actually give credit to sites such as TrekToday when due ) , is reporting about Sat.1 's plans to show new Trek episodes in Germany . Apparently , the current plan is to start showing DS9 's seventh season on Saturdays at 16:00 CET , starting on the 4th of September . Voyager 's fifth season is currently planned for the winter of 1999/2000 . The original update can be found here , courtesy of the German Trek Flash newsletter . <p> Viacom Second Quarter Results UpChristian ( 2:51 pm CST ) Viacom , the company which owns both Paramount Pictures and part of UPN , has reported the results for the second quarter of 1999 , which ended on June 30 . Net earnings from continuing operations jumped to $59 million , while a year ago they still had to report a loss of $20 million . The results turned out to be 50% higher than what most analysts predicted . Especially the Blockbuster rental chain , the results of homeo videos such as ' Saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and MTV Networks showed very strong results - not surprisingly , UPN was n't counted amongst these highlights .

The organiser of the convention is billing this as the last convention appearance by one of the Original Series cast members , though he refuses to say who . In the article , written by Todd Nelson , some of those cast members also speak on the topic : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the soft-spoken Koenig , 62 , who played Ensign Pavel Chekov . " But I suppose we have a finite existence . There was a time when I thought we could go on indefinitely . But the times are changing , and I can see a time when we will not be on the road . It 's inevitable . " <p> Doohan , who played Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott , pledged to keep going as long as he can . At 79 , he is the oldest living original cast member . " I do n't think it will fade as long as we 're alive , " he said , pausing while signing autographs and sitting for pictures with fans , many decked out in elaborate homemade costumes of Klingons and other characters . " I have a responsibility to go where the fans invite me . " <p> The full article can be found here - thanks go out to Dick Vohlers for the link . Meanwhile , I 've got a report here from Byron Amick , who recently attended a convention by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line to get George Takei 's autograph , one of the vendors apparently told him that the Raleigh convention was going to be the last appearance of Jimmy Doohan . Of course , the News &amp; Observer article seems to conflict with that , so , again , I 'd love to hear from someone who actually attended the con . <p> ' Gepetto ' ArticleChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) At CNN.com , there 's an article dealing with ' Gepetto , ' the new made-for-tv Disney musical . Most of the article is an interview with Drew Carey , who plays the title role , but it also contains a photo of RenT Auberjonois as Professor Bounragazzo . You can find the article here - thanks go out to Richard Rafter for this . <p> This is the final game manual , so there are some differences ( notably some of the hotkeys and the installation instructions ) .

Thanks go out to the Starfleet Universe for the lead . <p> Star Trek Books NewsChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) John Ordover at Pocket Books just updated his Q&amp;A Board again , answering three new questions . Take a look at the two most interesting : <p> Query from : Brent Why do all book submissions and books written have to focus around the main characters of the series , like Picard or Sisko ? What I mean is , why ca n't someone write a book totally from , say , a Romulan perspective ? <p> Response from : John Ordover They do n't . Check out Double Helix 3 if you do n't beleive me . BUT : When a new wrtier wants to come in , I need to see how they function with the regulars before I work out a story with them that 's not using the regular cast . <p> Query from : Antoine Hi once again . I had another question . Sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcover , I , Q , what is the summary of it ? I can tell by the cover that it takes place sometime after the uniform change so it has to be modern time Trek . Is it anything like Q-Squared ? Just wondering so I can save out enough money to purchase it . <p> Response from : John Ordover Always glad to give someone incentive to purchase one of our books . It 's a bit like Q-Squared , except that the entire multiverser is coming to an end , and only Q , Picard and Data are able to stand against it . It 's told entirely by " Q " in the first person . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The Quickening ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST .

One of the things she talks about in the interview is her first scene as Ezri Dax : <p> Did her own newcomer status make it easier to play confused new arrival Ezri ? " Yes , it definitely did , because every scene I went into in the beginning , it was , " Okay , now I 'm going to do my first scene with Armin ; it 's the first time I 've acted with Armin , and it 's the first time Ezri 's meeting Quark . ' So that really helped a lot . " Nicole has a great fondness for Armin Shimerman .

He 's really someone that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interview she talks about how she got cast , her previous experiences on sci-fi shows , Trills in general . <p> Q. How will having certain officers affect the performace of a ship ? A. Better officers make your ship behave , well , better . Rookie or Junior officers have negative effects . Senior officers are normal . Veterans and Legendaries have positive effects . Officers can gain experience from Rookie to Veteran . Legendary officers can not be trained , they must be discovered . <p> Q. How many different kinds of crew members can you purchase with prestige points ? A. Security , Weapons , Helm , Science and Engineering . <p> Four stars from the original " Star Trek " television series will be in town this weekend for what is being billed as their last joint appearance : James Doohan , Walter Koenig , Nichelle Nichols and George Takei . Just a month after the death of 79-year-old DeForest Kelley , who played Dr. Leonard McCoy in the series , promoters said the tour will end in Raleigh , and at least one actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fedora Entertainment , a Kansas-based company , brought the four actors together for a 14-state tour . While company owner David Scott wo n't say which actor will retire after his or her contract expires this weekend , many fans believe it is 79-year-old Doohan . <p> This certainly is surprising ( and sad ) news . Are any of you actually going to the convention on Sunday , by the way ? If so , I 'd love to receive a convention report - certainlyl I 'd like to hear which actor will be retiring . <p> More On Sorbo SeriesChristian ( 4:03 pm CST ) Steve Krutzler at TrekWeb has put up a report about the recent Sorbo series rumours , responding to TrekToday 's report that a former Trek writer will be serving as executive producer on that series , and Mania Magazine 's speculation that this could be Ronald D.

It has been hypothesized since the news of Moore 's departure from Voyager that he could become a writer for Majel Roddennberry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach another big-time Trek ex-writer/producer to head up her new series , but he turned it down in favor of persuing his own development projects . <p> However , I just checked with Creep , who says to stand behind his/her original report 100% : a former Trek writer will indeed be joining the new Sorbo show . Hopefully I 'll be able to give you some more info on the new Sorbo series in a few weeks . Of course , do remember that none of this has been officially confirmed yet . <p> ' Insurrection ' Rental Climbs AgainChristian ( 3:56 pm CST ) The San Francisco Chronicle , which is kind enough to publish a rental top-20 instead of a top-10 , just put up the new Video Rental chart , courtesy of Billboard Magazine . ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' manages to climb from no.16 to no.14 - the same spot it also occupied two weeks ago .

Though this was already known , the article also contains a rather interesting report on precisely what can be found on the DVDs : <p> The titles are in standard format , and have been digitally enhanced and remastered .

Cinescape picked up the story , which in turn led to Mania speculating that Ron Moore may be the writer in question . Now I 'm seeing several sites stating that TrekToday is reporting that Ron Moore will be joining the Sorbo series , while I never even mentioned his name in relation to the series . I guess this just goes to show that I myself will also have to be a bit more careful with rumours in the future - you never know what was actually reported and what was just guesswork . <p> In an apparent attempt to lure more students into science studies , the University of Glamorgan in Wales is offering a degree in Science and Science Fiction , in which courses about Star Trek and The X-Files will be included .

Take a look at a short quote from the transcript : <p> SteveKrutzler : From Brad : You both provided background voices for the " Vulcan 's Heart " audiobook , right ?

Take a look at one of the questions asked , and Jeff 's response : <p> Query From : Bob Manojlovich 1 ) Will you produce graphic novels such as DEBT OF HONOR ? 2 ) I love the fact that you will not do monthlies . Will you have any stories with original characters that have never before been seen ? 3 ) Will your " post-DS9 series finale " stories ' continuity be co-ordinated with Pocketbooks ' novels ? <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte 1 ) We have one major graphic novel in the simmering stage -- probably for early 2001 . I 'm not going to say anything more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , our Prestige Format one-shots will be about 44 pages long , so they 're pretty substantial stories . 2 ) I do n't know if we 'll be making up any new ships and crews just for the comics , but I think it 's likely that you 'll be seeing a lot of new characters over the next couple of years . 3 ) Yes , our DS9 stuff will be co-ordinated with Pocket Books , to the extent that we 'll both be working off the same post-series " bible . " It may be even more closely tied than that -- they have a great editorial crew over there , and we 've been talking about doing some fun stuff together . <p> More can be found in the full Q&amp;A update , which is also where you 'll be able to ask questions . <p> ' The Disease ' Overnight RatingsChristian ( 3:16 pm CST ) According to the Wednesday ratings report at UltimateTV , Voyager 's ' The Disease ' rerun scored a weaker-than-usual 2.1 rating / 3 share , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Seven Days , ' on one hour before Voyager , actually grabbed a 2.2 , which is one of the first times ever ( if not the first time ) this has happened . <p> Convention Dedicated To De KelleyChristian ( 3:14 pm CST ) At the Continuum , there 's a new thread up reporting about the upcoming Fantasticon convention , which will be organised by William Campbell ( Koloth , Trelane ) . Apparently , the convention will be dedicated to the memory of DeForest Kelley : <p> Fantasticon ' 99 , which is dedicated to the memory of DeForest Kelley , will also include a special memorial screening of his life and works . Campbell is glad to be celebrating the life of such a great actor . " I and the rest of those involved in Fantasticon , " the convention creator said , " are honored to recognize DeForest Kelley 's body of work and his special significance to Star Trek fans . " <p> Eon Reviews " Vulcan 's Heart " Christian ( 3:14 pm CST ) At Eon Magazine , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new novel written by Josepha Sherman and Susan Schwartz . The reviewer starts of by saying how he never liked the Star Trek novels , which certainly does n't give him a good start as unbiased reviewer . Still , after that he does go on to praise the book : <p> After many years of swearing off these types of books , it 's good to see that someone ( or in this case two someones ) knows that novels can be light yet well written . Sherman and Shwartz know the Trek universe well and create believable backdrops for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike , as well as fleshing out some worlds we 've only seen briefly . The Spock character especially feels like the one we 've been followed for years , never stepping the least bit out of character . Fans will love the little bits of Trek lore , such as a young Lieutenant Picard at Spock 's wedding ( as mentioned in the TNG episode " Sarek " ) or Captain Uhura of Starfleet Intelligence . We also get yet another fate for the Romulan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TREK novel run ) . <p> More can be found in the full review , which awards the book a B , making it one of the less positive " Vulcan 's Heart " reviews . It 's also the only " Vulcan 's Heart " review which was n't pointed out to me by Pocket Books editor John Ordover , but I 'm sure there 's no special significance in the combination of those two facts : - ) . <p> While Marvel is still keeping a tight lid on the most of the details regarding the ongoing series spinning off from Avengers Forever maxi-series later this fall , editor Tom Brevoort has revealed the identity of the creative team for the title ... and it includes a writer making his long-anticipated " return " to the House of Ideas . <p> According to Brevoort , joining penciler CrissCross ( Slingers ) will be industry veteran Peter David , writing his first Marvel series since leaving the Incredible Hulk in 1998 . " I ca n't get too in depth as to why I approached each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , " explained Brevoort . " But Peter certainly has a long and varied history as a writer working in the Marvel Universe behind him , and I thought it was a shame that he was n't doing any regular work for us at the moment . <p> More on the comic series , and on the reasons for Peter David joining the project , can be found by visiting the Daily Buzz . <p> New Series For Trek Guest Actor Christian ( 3:13 pm CST ) According to an article by Variety 's Richard Katz , a new ' Seinfield ' spin-off is in development at Castle Rock TV , the company which also produced the original series . The spin-off will apparently not revolve around any of the regular , but will instead focus on Jackie Chiles , the lawyer who always represented Kramer in his ' quixotic lawsuits ' against coffee and tobacco companies .

Thanks for listening and for bring Trek back to comics ! <p> Response From : Jeff Mariotte We 're in ongoing discussions with both Pocket Books and Peter David , and have every intention of bringing New Frontier stories to comics . Do n't count on a regular monthly -- for now , anyway , we 're not planning any monthlies . But we 'll make sure all the New Frontier fans get to see those characters in the pages of Star Trek comic books . <p> Query From : Bob Manojlovich For how long does Wildstorm have the licence for Star Trek comics ? Will we see New Frontier comics that are based on Peter David 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing Star Trek comics beginning in November 1999 , and running through most of 2001 .

The website is divided into 7 sections which will take you through each step of writing a teleplay . <p> The feature provides answers to questions such as " Are there any special rules or guidelines " and " What Terminology should I know , " and is really quite useful if you intend to submit a Trek script to Paramount . You can find the feature by going here . <p> Apparently not so canceled after all , the fourth wave of 9 " Target Exclusives is scheduled for an October/November ' 99 release .

The assortment features Kirk and Spock in fan-favorite , and much overlooked by Playmates , red movie-era Starfleet uniforms .

The 4.5 " " Gamesters of Triskelion " Twin Pack , planned to include Chekov , Uhura , and shirtless Kirk with collars of disobedience , has been canceled . <p> A number of the " Regulars " at MPlayer 's SFC lobby are trying to get fan-made portraits for SFC . Jinxx , the MPlayer MAN , has asked me to put a call out for the artists among you to create portraits for the different races . What we 're really looking for is pictures of people , either Federation , Klingon , Romulan , Lyran , Hydran , or Gorn . Do n't just take a screenshot from an episode . You have to do it yourself . When we get enough candidates , I 'll send them to Jinxx , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interplay , and possibly even Paramount ( which is why we do n't need people submitting THEIR stuff ) . <p> If your picture is approved by these folks , it may show up next to nicknames everywhere ! One final note . The pictures must be 120x120 pixels , and have to be viewable by everybody . No Romulan heads impaled on bat'leths with green blood spurting out of them . Remember , it 's a family show . Now get busy , artists !

Take a look at a few of the questions and answers at his Q&amp;A board : <p> Query from : Matt Perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what STTNG : The Forgotten War ( future title ) will be about . The cover looks intriguing ( although you should n't judge a book on its cover . ) <p> Response from : John Ordover It 's about Picard et al running into a lost crew from Captain Pike 's day , still fighting an endless war . <p> Query from : Brian John , I just read where you told someone " you 're just going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starfleet:Year One in the reprints of SNW I and II . Why should he ? This is an absurd idea . Thank God I have n't yet purchased them . It would make more sense to include a line at the end of December 's parts saying they 'll be continued in February . With all due respect , despite what you said about taking into account the opinions on the BBS , you obviously do n't take them into account or respect them . <p> Response from : John Ordover No , I respected them , I just did n't agree with them . Not the same thing .

Thanks go out to David Henderson for the info ! <p> -At 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the second-season TOS episode ' The Deadly Years , ' which is the one in which Kirk , McCoy and Scotty all become grumpy old men . <p> -Tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Hard Time , ' which is one of the best episodes of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> -In Germany , Sat.1 will be repeating DS9 's ' Blasphemie ' ( In The Hands Of The Prophets ) tomorrow morning at 01:35 CET . At 15:00 they 'll start showing the second season , in the form of ' Die Heimkehr ' ( Homecoming ) <p> Trek BBS TodayChristian ( 3:59 pm CST ) At the Trek BBS , we 've now got an amazing 400 members ! Take a look at some of the active discussions all those members are participating in : <p> What sort of idiot decides to stand in the middle of the road , 800 meters before the finish of the tenth stage of the Tour de France , just to make a photo of the Guerini , the eventual winner of this stage ? Thanks go out to Nu.nl for the photos . <p> When Alexander the Great surveyed the great city of Alexandria , seeing her glorious harbor and shimmering library , his heart thrilled with the hope that his mark would live forever , standing as a monument to future generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human whether the journey takes the form of art , empire or literature . Before I 'm worm food , I 'd know I 'd like to know I 've earned a footnote on a granite wall someplace , just to let future generations know " Heather was here . " <p> Like people , empires grow up and eventually deteriorate . History has no favorites . The mighty and the small topple with equal finality . Once an empire ripens , rotting soon follows . The historical cardiogram records each effort a civilization takes to save itself until it at last flatlines . Our fictions use the same paradigm . In Star Trek : Insurrection , concern is expressed for a quickly " ripening " Federation--a Federation weakened by the Dominion War , a Federation maturing and being corrupted by forces within and without . Even that nasty Risa-Vanessa Williams/Terry Farrell pottery episode played on the premise that the Federation was becoming a futuristic Rome : fat , indulged and decadent . How fascinating that the " Real Life " Trek world is in a similar situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my fellow fans , and whether the fruit can be plucked from the tree and preserved for another season , or whether it will mold and serve as spawning ground for flies has yet to be seen . <p> You can find the full feature by clicking here .

Click here to avoid reading those spoilers and be transported to the next update ( even though that contains spoilers as well ) . <p> Yesterday ( or for me : early this morning ) I attended the first Trek celebrity chat in my life , namely the Ultimate TV chat with Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) . What surprised me an awful lot was that there were so few people attending - only about 9 or 10 , while no more than 5 people stayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by at least fifty people . In any case , the chat was great fun , and Picardo provided us with the following information : <p> When asked about the Starfleet Academy rumours , he said " he 's heard them denied . " He knows there 's a new series in development , but he does n't know what it deals with . <p> He 'll soon direct a Voyager episode , which will start filming on the 26th of August , though his preparations will start one and a half week in advance . There may be a story idea for that episode now , though he does n't yet know what it is . He 's not sure he wants to direct more in the future - " In the director 's guild of America the highest heart attack rate was in the 1 hour directors demographic . " <p> The second show is a big Borg show . They 'll have lots of glitz in the first few episodes and everyone 's favourite aliens ( Borg , Klingons ) <p> He does n't believe there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . He thinks they 'd have to do something very wrong with the fans to loose fan support . <p> The Holodoc/Seven relationship will be explored further . He 'll have a few scenes with Seven which would be like most other men 's dreams . <p> Again , click here if you do not want to know about Voyager 's sixth season . <p> Editor Steve Hockensmith at Cinescape recently had a chance to talk with Brannon Braga , executive producer of Star Trek : Voyager . First of all , Braga talks about the recent ' Flight Academy ' rumours : <p> " We 've been chatting about a new series . We chat about a lot of things . I just ca n't comment on it . If I could tell you anything firm , I would , but everything 's very nebulous right now . I will say to you that I do n't know where that Flight Academy rumor started . If there is a new Star Trek series , I highly doubt if it will have anything to do with Starfleet Academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next series . " <p> He then goes on to stress again how premature all of this is , and that there ' has n't been any kind of official talk with the studio about it . ' This does sound an awful lot like spin control to me - we 've heard numerous times the new series is already very much in development . <p> Braga also shared some info on Voyager 's sixth season , telling us that no radical changes for the show are planned . He does tell us about a two-hour Voyager telefilm , which is planned for November , and which will introduce a new major menace to the Delta Quadrant . In the episode , Voyager will encounter the ruins of an ancient civilization that was destroyed 500 years ago . Voyager discovers a vast army of these aliens in stasis , and when they wake up and are intent on taking over the galaxy again , Voyager needs to put the genie back in the bottle . <p> Lastly , Braga provides us with detailed info on the first four episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but unfortunately then this update would get even larger than it already is : - ) . You can find the info for yourself by visiting Cinescape . <p> The most obvious ( and awesome ) graphical change are the targeting reticles for the various races . Each race has its own reticle , of course , and every one I 've seen is shockingly cool . So far , I 've only seen the reticles for the Federation , Klingons , and Hydrans . All of them are very , very impressive . <p> For some reason , shuttles now glow yellow instead of blue ( as in the previous versions ) . Not sure why this is so , but there it is . The color change does n't impact the game positively OR negatively . It 's just different . NO biggie at all . Also , missiles are colored purple . This MAY be because I 'm only using the big , fast , " whupass " warheads . The missiles MAY be color coded according to type , but I 'm not gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( wink ) <p> There have been minor modifications to the interfaces . Again , no biggie at all . They just look a little cooler . For example , the font on the mine display looks like a true-type Arial font . Just looks cooler . No impact on gameplay , but cool nonetheless . <p> Vulcan 's Heart ChatsChristian ( 1:46 pm CST ) Today , Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz , authors of the new " Vulcan 's Heart " novel , will be attending a live chat on AOL . The chat begins at 10:00pm Pacific Time at Keyword : Star Trek Club . <p> On Thursday , TrekWeb will be hosting a live chat with Sherman and Schwartz . That chat will begin at 10:00pm EDT , though you can already submit questions here . <p> TV Barn Braga/Moore ArticleChristian ( 1:46 pm CST ) Ho Hum . John Zipperer at TV Barn has put up a new edition of his " Zippy 's SF Loft " column , in which he looks at recent happenings in the SF world . This week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Voyager staff , and the internet reaction to that . In his article , he also mentions TrekToday and the Trek Nation : <p> Trek Today has been at the eye of the storm , serving as more of an unfiltered bulletin board than as journalism . Read enough of the bickering there and you start to have more sympathy for William Shatner telling fans to " Get a life . " Therein lies a good lesson that simply because people write articles about an event , they are not automatically journalists . One service the site did perform is the publication of John Bierce 's feature article , " The Franchise 's Future , " sic - TT in which the writer takes to task the irresponsible spreading of stories based not on fact but on rumor , speculation , and innuendo . <p> Needless to say , I do n't agree with that part of the article ( and I 'm hoping most of you do n't either ) , but you can decide for yourself by reading the full article . Of course , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us know at feedback@treknation.com so we can improve the site . Thanks go out to Jim Wright for pointing me to this . <p> Star Trek Gourmet Coffee ReviewChristian ( 1:45 pm CST ) At the Daily Sci-Fi , there 's a new report from John Windberg , who recently attended the WesterCon convention . While there , he picked up three bags of ' Star Trek : The Gourmet Coffee , ' available at $4.50 a bag . When asked about the taste of " Raspberry Assimilation " , " Tribble 's Choice " , and " Klingon Raktajino " ( the three flavours available ) , he replied ' They taste really gross . ' Pictures of the actual coffee can be found here . <p> Would I recommend this demo for download ? Most definitely . This demo does exactly what a demo should do . It whets your appetite and leaves you wanting more . You can sample the Klingon side of things , but it just does n't have the same feel as commanding an Enterprise-class vessel . Get the demo , and save some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . <p> Great Voyager Ratings NewsChristian ( 1:45 pm CST ) UK Picard Fan just sent in a news item which will certainly sound fantastic to everyone following Voyager 's ever-declining ratings . Apparently , the June 14-20 edition of Variety magazine contained an article , based on research by Nielsen Media , which had Voyager as a top ratings performer : <p> UPN 's " Star Trek : Voyager " tops the list of shows on each net that most efficiently reach one of the key upscale viewer groups - adults 18-49 living in homes with the head of household having completed four or more years of college . <p> Apparently , in the table which outlines the research findings , Voyager is given an index of 140 ( although it does n't say what this equates to ) , ahead of ABC 's " The Practice " on 136 , Fox 's " Ally McBeal " on 136 and NBC 's " Frasier " on 133 . Major thanks go out to UK Picard Fan for sending this in - this certainly is very good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1:43 pm CST ) Billy ' Wicked ' Wilson at VoodooExtreme has posted two all-new screenshots of Raven 's upcoming ' Voyager : Elite Force ' shooter . The first shot shows a Voyager cargo bay , where a Scavenger alien just beamed in ( unfortunately we ca n't see it ) . The second shot is more interesting , as it shows the player firing a new weapon at a Borg , while inside a Borg environment . This second shot actually looks a bit disappointing - the Borg cube is n't nearly as claustrophobic as I 'd like it to be . <p> F. Murray Abraham In ' Muppets'Christian ( 1:43 pm CST ) Variety 's Joe Leydon has written a review of ' Muppets In Space , ' the sixth full-length feature film showcasing Jim Henson 's puppets . The film apparently focuses on Gonzo , who has a bit of a personality crisis after encountering Noah ( F. Murray Abraham ) : <p> The opening dream sequence , in which a skeptical Noah ( F. Murray Abraham ) refuses to admit Gonzo aboard the Ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor little guy 's main concern : There is no one ( or nothing ) quite like him on Earth . His mood lightens only when he begins to receive cryptic messages ( R U There ' ' ) in his Capt . Alphabet breakfast cereal . Based on this and other evidence , Gonzo snaps to the idea that maybe there 's a good reason he 's unique -- that is , maybe he 's the offspring of extraterrestrials . <p> F. Murray Abraham starred on ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' as bad guy Ahdar Ru'afo . Interestingly , his last project before ' Muppets in Space ' was the mini-series ' Noah 's Ark , ' in which he starred as Lot . More info on the Muppets movie can be found here - apparently the movie even includes a few Star Trek references . <p> Happy Birthdays ! Christian ( 1:42 pm CST ) Today is the 59th birthday of Patrick Stewart , who is of course best known for his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the Starship Enterprise . As I learned yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Robert Picardo . <p> -Tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , British Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Rules of Engagement , ' according to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . At 18:00 tomorrow , BBC Two will be showing TNG 's ' Ship in a Bottle . ' <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 1:41 pm CST ) This morning I received a mail from Amazon.com which was truly nice . About 8 months ago , I subscribed to their ' Eyes ' service , which is supposed to inform you when new books matching your criteria are available for shipping . I thought that this was a cool feature , which could hopefully help me to report here on TrekToday when new Star Trek novels were available . Unfortunately , over the next six months I got precisely one mail , and I was n't exactly that impressed with them . <p> Until this morning , that is , when they sent me a mail with as subject ' A gift from Amazon.com . ' In it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail about four times , but there really did n't appear to be a catch - Amazon did actually want to give me ten dollars ! Of course , when visiting their site again I found out that shipping costs from the US to the Netherlands are at least $6.00 , but still . I 'll probably order the new Sherman / Schwartz novel " Vulcan 's Heart " - with the $4.00 discount I 'll only have to pay $12 , which is a lot less than the $30 my local bookstore will ask for it when it finally arrives here . Thanks Amazon ! <p> Monday July 12 , 1999 <p> Rene Echevarria InterviewChristian ( 3:48 pm CST ) At the Great Link , they 've put up an interview with DS9 writer Rene Echevarria , which first appeared in the British Star Trek Monthly magazine . The interview contains some interesting thoughts from Echevarria on planning the Final Chapter : <p> " We tacked our way towards where we wanted to go , and started throwing balls up in the air , as we had fewer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors had been closed and certain doors left open , we started to have more urgency and fewer options , and even as we were moving into the final episode , we were n't exactly sure what it meant . Dukat and Sisko in some kind of climactic conflict that plays off his Emissary thing with the Pagh-wraiths , that 's all we knew . We did n't know what it was going to be , even in the final two-hour episode , as we sat down to break work out the story . There were a couple of days during that time when I was a little scared that we had painted ourselves into a corner , but somehow we escaped without leaving too many footprints . " <p> New " Vulcan 's Heart " ReviewChristian ( 3:40 pm CST ) Pocket Books editor John Ordover just sent in a news submission about a new " Vulcan 's Heart " review , written by Kevin Lauderdale of the Kevindex . Lauderdale was rather impressed with the novel : <p> In the summer of 1997 , I lavished praise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VULCAN 'S FORGE . Like VULCAN 'S FORGE , their new novel , the sequel VULCAN 'S HEART , tells the story of Spock 's life and adventures after the " death " of Captain Kirk . It brings together ( none of these are spoilers since all of these elements are on the dust jacket ) : a young Jean-Luc Picard and his ship " Stargazer " ; Saavik ; the female Romulan commander from TOS : " The Enterprise Incident " ; and the " Enterprise-C " from TNG : " Yesterday 's Enterprise . " And it 's long : 378 pages . It takes that many pages to tell a story this complex . This is epic Trek at its best . <p> The full review can not yet be find on the Kevindex itself , but it is also extremely positive . Thanks go out to John Ordover for sending this in ! <p> Mailbag , Take TwoChristian ( 3:34 pm CST ) Unfortunately yesterday I provided the wrong link when reporting about the new edition of the Trek Nation mailbag .

For those of you who have n't heard of SFCEdit , it 's a great editor utility for the Starfleet Command Demo , which currently allows you to edit many of the ship systems of the Federation Heavy Cruiser . Future versions will allow you to edit other ships included in the demo . <p> New Garrett Wang InterviewChristian ( 3:33 pm CST ) The Great Link has re-printed an interview with Voyager star Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) , which first appeared in the British Star Trek Monthly magazine . In the interview , he talks about how he feels he is the ' Delta Quadrant Cheerleader : ' <p> " Of all people , I would consider myself the cast cheerleader . I want the best of everything for Voyager : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storylines to really further the characters . When I look at our cast , I 'm amazed by everyone 's individual talent and I really do think we have a pretty good chemistry together . I want that to come out in every episode we do . So I try to do what it takes to encourage the show along . I spend my free time in the editing room and in the production meetings , and try to keep myself involved in the show as a whole . I also want to try to direct at some point . And that , for me , keeps boredom from coming in . Because honestly , although there are some wonderful episodes like " Timeless " , Kim spends most of his time sitting back - as the other characters have to - waiting to come to bat . " <p> In the full interview , which was written by David Bassom , Wang also talks about the episode ' Timeless ' and the rumours about a Wang/Ryan relationship . <p> Again , click here to avoid some ( minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news can be found at the Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage : Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) has signed an extension guaranteeing her commitment to Star Trek : Voyager through a seventh season ! Ryan said this at the recent SciFi Expo convention , where she was onstage for a Q&amp;A session . Take a look at some more info which Jeri Ryan provided at the convention : <p> Jeri recently spent three days back in full Borg costume and make-up for an upcoming episode , though she did n't explain the reason . ' Survival Instinct ' ? - TT <p> Contrary to Internet rumors , Jeri is not involved in the X-Men movie . <p> More can be found by visiting the news page of the official JLR Homepage . <p> Ordover UpdatesChristian ( 3:32 pm CST ) As is usual on Mondays , Pocket Books editor John Ordover has updated his Q&amp;A board , once again providing us with some interesting looks at the Star Trek books universe : <p> Query from : Bob 1 ) Will the crew of the Challenger be all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? 2 ) If so , will they be from TVTrek or booktrek ? 3 ) Has the class of the Challneger been established ? If so , would you tell us ? <p> Response from : John Ordover The crew of the challenger has not yet been determined , nor has the class of the ship . <p> More can be found at his Q&amp;A Board . Perhaps more interesting is a post at Pocket 's Star Trek Books Bulletin Board , in which he talks about the recent Campbell Award conference , which he also attended . The subject of this year 's discussion at the conference was ' SF in movies and on television and its effect on book publishing , ' which of course Ordover also had several thoughts on - you can find that here . <p> Robert Picardo Live ChatChristian ( 3:32 pm CST ) Tonight at 9:00pm Eastern Time , Ultimate TV will be hosting a live chat with Robert Picardo , who stars as the Holodoc on Star Trek Voyager . You do first need to register to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Thanks go out to CARPE , Picardo 's official fan club , for this info . <p> Massive Star Trek Game FeatureChristian ( 3:31 pm CST ) The folks at 3DGaming.net have put up a rather massive new feature looking at the upcoming Star Trek games by Interplay and Activision . As is almost usual for a Star Trek game feature nowadays , they begin by telling us how all previous games were bad : <p> Yes , it 's true ; Star Trek games have never really been hits . The onslaught of cheap clones bearing the Star Trek name have only brought shame to the franchise and not been worth the $50 companies make you pay for them . I 'm sure all Star Trek fans have downloaded and tried the ST : Klingon Honor Guard demo . It was supposed to be one of the first good Star Trek games . Using the Unreal engine , it developed a great deal of hype . But what happened ? To put it nicely it sucked ! It was a half-done job using the Unreal name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much famed ST : Starfleet Academy ? It was probably the most sought after ST game ever , boasting to put you behind the captains chair and in total control of a starship and its crew , waging war on alien races while making peace with others . Too bad it only turned out to be a cheap XvT clone in which the only thing that mattered was who could tap the fire key faster . Oh yeah , and there was that old training officer guy who kept telling you " your score is inadequate you 'll have to repeat the mission . " I must have seen that FMV so many damn times that I just wanted to take a photon torpedo and stick it up his err , anyway , the game turned out to be a big disappointment . <p> Starfleet Academy was actually rather good , IMHO , but that may just be me . You can find the full preview here - thanks go out to Evil Avatar for the link . <p> It 's also apparent that this book was based primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of the lines in the novelization vary from the ones which were aired , and some of the descriptions of character behavior differ markedly from the screen version . Worf 's reaction to learning that Dax and Bashir have consummated their relationship , for instance , is pleasantly paternalistic on the show , but darkly pained in the novel . Sisko gets bossier with Yates , Odo acts more physically affectionate with Kira . He 's also more aggressive with the female changeling , aided by descriptions of his internal thoughts and decisions . <p> In the end Green decides she rather likes the novelization , as you can read here . <p> Six New ' DS9 : The Fallen ' ScreenshotsChristian ( 3:31 pm CST ) GA-Source has published six new screenshots of the Collective 's upcoming 3D action game ' Deep Space Nine : The Fallen . ' All screenshots show Benjamin Sisko , standing in front of several rather great looking environments . You can find the screenshots here - thanks go out to Blue 's News for the link . <p> Today On TVChristian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently not at 11:00pm ) , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the Original Series episode ' Journey to Babel , ' the episode which introduced us to Spock 's parents . 163809 @qwx573809 <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:30 pm CST ) If all goes as planned , the news update script I 'm currently using should get a major overhaul by the actual creator of the script ... I ca n't tell yet precisely which things will be changed ( mostly because we have n't yet figured it all out ) , but I can tell you it 's going to be extremely great ! If anyone 's got any suggestions , please send them my way . <p> Sunday July 11 , 1999 <p> New MailbagChristian ( 4:49 pm CST ) I just put up the second regular edition of the Trek Nation Mailbag ! This week , the mailbag contains the first reactions to Valentine Winter 's ' Defending Flight Academy ' article , more mails about the Voyager cancellation rumours , and some final thoughts on the Ron Moore departure . Jim Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their featured articles . You can find all that and more by going here . <p> You may have noticed that the mailbag is slightly late today , and that my own mailbag responses are n't as , erm , insightful as I would like them to be . The reason is that the mailbag takes up a rather large amount of time - especially considering the volume of mail that is sent in . If someone would like to take over mailbag answering duties , please send me a mail at christian@trektoday.com and you 'll have my eternal gratitude : - ) . <p> Interplay 's Warren Schultz has just e-mailed me that the discs for SFC Beta Two have been shipped . They 're being mailed via Airborne Express ( FedEx to ROWorld ) and all the testers should have their copies by the end of next week . <p> People not lucky enough to participate in the beta test can of course still download the demo . <p> Second DS9 Farewell CommunicatorChristian ( 2:17 pm CST ) Gustavo Leao sends along word of the new edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official Star Trek Fan Club . This issue contains part two of their ' Bon Voyage DS9 ' feature , which says farewell to the third Star Trek series . The new issue contains interviews with people such as Herman Zimmerman and Michael Westmore , a look at all the people you usually only see as names on the credits , and interviews with several supporting cast members . The magazine also contains stuff which is n't necessarily connected to DS9 ending , including one story from the ' Strange New Worlds II ' collection and Rick Berman 's thoughts on the future of Star Trek . More info on what the new issue contains can be found here . <p> Boxleitner A TrekkerChristian ( 2:09 pm CST ) The Swiss Daily Trek newsletter is reporting that Bruce Boxleitner ( Babylon 5 , Sheridan ) considers himself a Star Trek fan . At the Fed Con 7 convention , he confessed that it had been his dream for a long time to have a role on Star Trek . <p> Another Stafleet Command PreviewChristian ( 2:07 pm CST ) Moyzan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command , ' the new Interplay game which every site in the world seems to want to preview . This preview is quite comprehensive , though , and even contains a bit of info on the Starfleet Battles game on which Starfleet Command is based : <p> SFB , ECM , EM , PH-1 , HB . Sound familiar ? Yup , you 're right , this is Star Fleet Battles terminology . SFB has finally jumped to the computer world , and is being designed by Quicksilver and published by Interplay . For those poor souls who did not have the chance to play SFB these past twenty years , let me briefly explain what it is . SFB is a board game that simulates combat between ships from the Star Trek original series and adds some new races not seen on TV . You can control every aspect of your ship , ranging from tractor beams and transporters , to space mines and myriad other things . Just to give you an idea of the complexity of the game , if you put all the rules in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's not counting all the ship 's systems displays ! Do n't panic , though Star Fleet Command is much easier to learn , even though it might be confusing at the start for the novice . <p> The full preview can be found here . Speaking of Starfleet Battles , is there anyone else who remembers ' Prime Directive , ' the role-playing game set in the SFB universe ? I own several of the source books , but I seem to be the only person in the world who stil remembers the game . Does anyone have any info on what happened to it ? Drop me a line ! Thanks go out to StarTrekGames.Net ( still without a functioning domain ) for the link . <p> UK Trek RatingsChristian ( 2:05 pm CST ) After two weeks , the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective has once again posted a British Star Trek ratings report . Voyager appears to be doing extremely well in the UK : <p> With no ST on terrestrial channels , Voyager was the only rated Trek on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Trek encouraged more people to watch Voyager , as it got a great #4 ranking , 0.71m viewers - only just behind The X-Files ( by 0.02m viewers ) . <p> I wish the series was performing as well in the US . In any case , find the original report here . <p> EMH Mark 2 Enters Drug ProgramChristian ( 2:05 pm CST ) Andy Dick , who guest starred in Voyager 's " Message in a Bottle " as the EMH Mark 2 , has asked a judge in the Los Angeles Superior court to consider him for a drug diversion program . This could clear him of the charges brought against him for owning marihuana and cocaine , and for crashing his car into a telephone pole while driving under influence , according to a report at Jam ! Showbiz : <p> Dick , 33 , had been scheduled to enter a plea Friday to charges including cocaine and marijuana possession and hit-and-run driving . Instead , he appeared Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court and asked to be sent to the drug program . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arraignment Aug. 12 . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 2:05 pm CST ) -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' The Bar Association ' at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST . At 20:00 , they 'll be showing the new Voyager episode ' Bride of Chaotica . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> -In Germany , Sat.1 will be showing DS9 's ' Meuterei ' ( Dramatis Personae ) . As you may recall , about a week ago I mentioned here that Sat.1 's episode info page showed a picture of Voyager - they 've now changed it to show Deep Space Nine . Did anyone actually mail the station about this ? <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 2:03 pm CST ) Heehee ! Take a look at how a new spam mail I received this morning started : <p> By DELETING internet email you are wasting just one keystroke . Just think of how many other resources are wasted by receiving standard mail ... ( paper , trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the planet ! ! ! <p> Yes ! Everyone send out spam ! You will help make Planet Earth a better place ! <p> P.S.1 - Yes , there really is an incredibly small amount of news today . <p> P.S.2 - If you visit TrekToday during the first hour after this update , you wo n't see a link to the new mailbag yet - I 'm finishing it up as we speak , but I 'm not quite ready yet . <p> Saturday July 10 , 1999 <p> Defending Flight AcademyChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) Valentine Winter strikes again ! In a new featured article at the Trek Nation , he looks at the recent ' Flight Academy ' rumours , and tells us why such a series might actually be a good idea : <p> ' Flight Academy ' would offer us a look at a part of the Star Trek Universe which we have n't ever been able to see : the Federation itself . Yes , we 've seen Starfleet , but how much do we know about the actual Federation ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth ? What sort of society have we humans formed in the 24th century ? We probably know more about how the Klingons live than about how we humans life ! <p> In a way , ' Flight Academy ' could be the perfect continuation to Deep Space Nine . That series focused on the political situation between all the big Alpha Quadrant powers , and showed us how Bajor was rebuilt after the Occupation .

In the interview , Statz mostly talks about the technical aspects of designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the actual game will play : <p> CGR : What type of maps are you working on now ? JS : Currently I 'm working on the Scavenger Mission . Early in the game , you defend Voyager from invading aliens called Scavengers . You soon discover that you need something from their ship . You then infiltrate their vessel , which is made up of a variety of different looking space ships . So , basically , I 'm making spaceship interiors at the moment . <p> CGR : Are there any innovative uses of the levels to affect gameplay ? Such as the corridors in Voyager to travel through and find different routes , escape foes , etc. ? JS : Like I mentioned above , different missions will have different objectives , and the way you accomplish them will vary . One mission you might be in a run and gun fight for your life , the next you may be sneaking around and gathering information , the next you might be guiding a few team members through an alien ship . We 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . <p> You know we received a ton of entries suggesting new Star Trek shows as well--and rather than try to pick the best out of this numerous category , we 're just going to summarize some of these suggestions for you . <p> You can find the new series ideas ( with titles such as ' Discovery , ' ' Smuggler ' and ' Temporal Sentry ' ) by going here . <p> Best-selling Star Trek novelist Peter David has written an episode of " Crusade " , the " Babylon 5 " sequel series . In the US , the episode " Ruling From the Tomb " will air on Wednesday , July 14 , at 10pm ET/PT on the cable network TNT . It will be repeated the following Monday at approximately 11pm ET/PT . <p> Thanks go out to David for sending this in ! <p> Star Trek World Tour WebcamChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) Issue 36 of the German Daily Trek newsletter contains a report about a webcam which has been installed in Vienna , current location of the Star Trek World Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to see the visitors in at the Tour , and perhaps even catch a few glimpses of the special events happening at the Tour . You can find the webcam here . Do n't bother with the actual World Tour itself , though - when I visited it in Dnsseldorf in December , it was the biggest disappointment I had in a long time . <p> Insurrection has made 1.1 million dollars in Italy after 3 weeks ( it has been number 1 for all 3 weeks ) . It has also made 413,000 after 6 weeks in Sweden . There is no total overseas boxoffice mentioned , but based on the last total ( $43.2 ) reported by Variety after the first weekend in Italy , the overseas boxoffice should now be over 44 million . <p> ' The Longest Trek ' MovieChristian ( 3:45 pm CST ) The Daily Sci-Fi has a report up by Ben Sian , who talks about the DragonCon convention . While there , he met Grace Lee Whitney ( Yeoman Janice Rand ) , who told him about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek ' book : <p> She 's got a new book out called " The Longest Trek . " More than just your typical Star Trek-era memiors , Ms. Whitney candidly discusses her descent into drugs and alcohol and her eventual return from the bottom . This is the stuff of which Oprah interviews are made , and she 's hoping to be on Oprah sometime very soon . The book 's currently in its third printing and she hopes to make it into a movie . <p> With that said , here 's your chance to be a screenwriter . Ms. Whitney openly solicited people to adapt her book into a screenplay . She 's looking for some good screen treatments . <p> New Trek Book ListChristian ( 3:45 pm CST ) Psi Phi webmaster David Henderson just posted an announcement at the Simon &amp; Schuster Star Trek Books board , talking about his own personal influence on the Star Trek book line : <p> You know of the list of all the Star Trek novels , in the back of the books , yes ? <p> Assuming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed typos ( " David " Galanter wrote TNG #31 ? ) , mislistings ( " Insurrection " is a TOS novel ? " The 34th Rule " and the " My Brother 's Keeper " books are unnumbered ? ) , and missing books ( " Mission to Horatius " , to name one ) . That is changing . I made a new list , with the typos fixed , the mislistings righted , the missing books included , and a slightly different format with a couple of new categories . <p> I am told that the September paperbacks ( the " Pathways " reprint and " The Forgotten War " ) will be the first books to include the new list . When I started working on the list , I expected the November books to be the first ones to have the list , so the list actually will actually have a little foreshadowing for the first couple of months . <p> ' Flight Academy ' For Real ? Christian ( 3:44 pm CST ) In his new Mr. Showbiz column , Jeffrey Wells responds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumours were called ' Bogus . ' According to Wells , Flight Academy is still very much in development : <p> She may be denying this because Paramount execs may want to make the announcement themselves later on ( or some such motive ) but she 's oil-slicking all the same . I double-checked with my sources Wednesday , and the story is 100 percent accurate . The spokesperson 's claim that 2002 is the earliest a new Trek pilot will hit TV sounds like a good ballpark figure . Paramount head Sherry Lansing has said it will take about two years . <p> I 'm going to make a major turnaround here - I do now actually believe ' Flight Academy ' is the current project being worked on at Paramount . I still do n't believe the 2002 premiere date , though . What would Berman and Braga need three years of development time for , twice as much as the other series had ? Hopefully we should get some more info on this soon . <p> ' Insurrection ' At 16th PlaceChristian ( 3:44 pm CST ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video rentals , which also still contains the ' Insurrection ' video . According to the top 20 ( which was compiled for the July 10 edition of Billboard magazine ) , ' Insurrection ' dropped 4 places to no. 16 . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:44 pm CST ) -Tomorrow in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Sons of Mogh ' at 16:00 BST . At 17:00 tomorrow , they 'll be showing Voyager 's ' The Chute . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> Eon Moore ArticlesChristian ( 3:54 pm CST ) The people at Eon Magazine have put up two very interesting articles dealing with the departure of Ronald D. Moore from the Voyager writing staff . The first article , written by Christopher Allan Smith , looks at the reasons for Ron Moore 's departure and the rumours surrounding it : <p> When contacted by phone for this story this week , Moore told EON , " I just decided it 's time to move on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that publicly . It really just did n't work out for me and VOYAGER and I just decided to leave . I can say that I 've seen a lot of the rumors too and I can say it did n't have anything to do with any scripts . There was no creative issue that drove me away . I saw various things about it being a reaction to ' Survival Instinct ' which was really the only episode I did , or an episode I helped Bryan Fuller on , and that 's not true . It had nothing to do with any creative issues at all . " <p> ... <p> In commenting about the rumors revolving around Moore 's departure , Bryan Fuller scoffed . " We thought about making up all this kind of stuff , " he says . " Like with Ron being very uncomfortable with the VOYAGER writing staff and him going through a sex change . Those things are just as close to the truth as what 's being printed on the Internet . It 's surprising where the rumors go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , and you can see how they got twisted through four retellings into the wild stuff out there . The dog became a bear . It 's kind of silly . " <p> More can be found in the full article . Perhaps more interesting is an article by Mark A. Altman , who says goodbye to Ron Moore : <p> While I 'm sure he 'll make his mark in the future on many other shows and films , I have no doubt that Ron 's sure hand and ample talent will forever be missed on the frontlines of the final frontier . In any event , he has left a legacy of Star Trek stories that can not be taken away . Live long and prosper , Ron Moore . <p> Overnight Ratings ' Bliss'Christian ( 3:53 pm CST ) Unfortunately it appears the Universe has n't yet posted its Overnight Ratings Report for Wednesday 's repeat of ' Bliss , ' so I 'll guess you 'll just have to make do with my commentary . According to Ultimate TV , ' Bliss ' got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points down from last week . With that it was the sixth shows on all networks , right behind " Dawson 's Creek " which scored a 3.4 rating . <p> I know there 's a lot of speculation out there as to the how 's and why 's of my departure , but I 'd really rather not get into the details of what happened . ( Dirty laundry and all that . ) What I will say is that I realized that it was time for me to move on and that I left more out of sorrow than in anger . I have no bitter feelings over what happened and I wish everyone associated with Trek and with Voyager only the best . <p> As most of you probably will not have AOL , we took the liberty of re-posting Ron Moore 's post at the Trek Nation - you can find that by going here . Thanks go out to Fred Shedian for sending in the post . <p> If you have n't already done so , be sure to check out this farewell to Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This look at the actor famed for portraying Captain Kirk on " Star Trek " includes little known facts about his life , including his battle with a chronic ear problem that nearly drove him to suicide .

Kennedy for reporting this . <p> Blaze Of Glory Cards AnnouncedChristian ( 3:52 pm CST ) Big Customizable Card Game news - the people at Decipher have put up the full card list of the upcoming ' Blaze of Glory ' expansion pack at their web site . You can get the list in . pdf , . html , . txt or . doc format by going here . <p> Berman At ' South Park ' PremiereChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) The new edition of Eon Magazine contains a report of the ' South Park : Bigger , Longer &amp; Uncut ' premiere , which was of course attended by many stars . One of the people attending it was of course Brent Spiner ( Data ) , who had a voice role in the movie . More surprising was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek . You can see a picture of Berman at the premiere by going here . <p> Voyager Syndication Promo InfoChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) Mr. Video Productions has posted some extremely interesting news about the Paramount promotion plans for Voyager 's syndication run , in the form of a letter sent to Program Directors . The most interesting news is that the Voyager reruns wo n't be shown in order , but rather according to certain Theme Weeks : <p> Theme Weeks : To help even further bolster your promotional push and make sure your viewers are going to watch VOYAGER " five flights a week , " we are doing something that no syndicator has ever done before . Starting with the VOYAGER launch on September 13 through the end of November sweep ( December 3 ) , you will have individual theme weeks supported with special on-air generics and theme week episodic graphics - EVERY WEEK ! Here 's a list of the theme weeks with their air schedule dates and " working " titles : <p> Several years ago , I applied and was approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since that initial card , I 've gone from the standard card , to a gold , and now a platinum MasterCard . Each one brought nice Trek-related benefits , like merchandise discounts , the Star Trek Communicator magazine at a special price , and discounted tickets to conventions , plus each card has had a cool picture of different Enterprises . Over the years , the account has also brought an ever-increasing interest rate ( currently just over 17% ) . In the last year , because of some major repairs to our two cars and house , we 've accumulated a good-sized debt using this same card . Of course , the interest paid per month has skyrocketed ! I called MBNA America to see if they had a lower interest rate . I was told yes , but the lower interest rate was NOT available with any Star Trek card ! I ca n't help but feel I 've been discriminated against . So , Buyer Beware . <p> Thanks go out to the person who sent this in - this certainly sounds very weird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK , Sky One will be showing DS9 's ' Return to Grace ' at 16:00 BST , followed an hour later by Voyager 's ' Flashback . ' Thanks go out to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective for this . <p> Ron &amp; Brannon FeatureChristian ( 4:03 pm CST ) At the Trek Nation , we just put up what is probably our most in-depth feature since TrekToday 's E3 section two months ago . The feature deals with everything related to the recent Ron Moore / Brannon Braga rumours , and includes everything from opinion articles to a special mailbag . The most interesting thing , however , must be a farewell to Ron Moore , written by one of his former colleagues at Paramount : <p> Ronald Moore was one of Star Trek 's greatest strengths . His work on Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Generations , and Star Trek : First Contact brought drama , characterization , vision , and fun to our imaginary universe . Ron understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not too different from you and I who somehow find the courage within themselves to meet the challenges of the final frontier . <p> But Ron also knew how to have fun with Star Trek , and he enjoyed putting a bit of lightheartedness in his stories . Doing all of this on a television schedule is damned hard work . To do it many times over a period of years takes more from a person than most viewers probably realize . Ron did all this and more . <p> I was tempted to quote the whole farewell here , but you 'll just have to read the rest here . It really is very moving . Other things you can find in the special feature include a new mailbag , a response from TrekWeb 's Steve ' Berserker ' Perry to the ' Defending Braga ' article , and two rather interesting featured articles . You can find all that and more in the full feature , which is definitely worth checking out . <p> Also , let me thank everyone who sent in mailbag responses and article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very grateful to those of you who took the time to send in their thoughts . <p> Update , 9:36 CET : Ron Moore himself just posted a farewell message to his AOL folder , in which he talks about his reasons for leaving and his ten years on Star Trek . We decided to include this open letter in our Ron &amp; Brannon feature - you can find it here . <p> Trekweb has learned that Ken Biller , former Voyager writer who in the offseason left the show to produce a production deal of his own with Paramount and UPN , will be returning in at least a part time role as co-executive producer , filling in the vacancy left at the post by the departure of Ron Moore . As expected , Robert Doherty remains on as the writer brought in to replace Moore 's role in the writing staff . <p> The original report can be found here , though it does n't contain any more info . <p> How will Deep Space Nine get past the stigmata with Star Trek based games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well on the technology side , the game will be using the Unreal engine , with a third-person POV that will allow players to do things with the characters you ca n't do from a first-person perspective : climb obects , swing on monkey bars , and slide down things . With all this character interaction , The Collective had to expand Unreal 's character animation system with a skeletal-based one . This new system will now allow them to get in a lot more movement . For example , the arms and head can be manipulated independently from any animation , and they now move to track and target enemies while even running . In addition , a new level of detail system will let the development team reduce a character 's polygon count as it gets smaller . <p> The new screenshots can be found by going here and scrolling down to the bottom of the page . Thanks go out to Federation HQ for the link . One of these days you should also finally get to see our own ' DS9 - The Fallen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the time to type it up . <p> Voyager Cancellation RumoursChristian ( 3:52 pm CST ) Here we are again for our weekly session of starting worries and inviting flame mails : - ) . Lord Spock has sent in another report on the rumoured Voyager cancellation : <p> Management still feels the ratings are too low for comfort . If the ratings stay as low as they have been with some of the worst-performing episodes , Voyager will most likely end by the end of season six . A major promotional campaign will start at the end of this month . The actors have already been booked on talk shows to promote the show . <p> UPN is in major trouble . UPN is losing money and there is nothing more to be done . The network hopes that the new fall schedule will get them out of the hole . It is rumoured that UPN could close down or even be bought out at the end of next season , though this not confirmed at all . If this happens , Voyager could conceivably be brought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been confirmed , this is only one source , and this is only one site , making this officially nothing more than rumours . Let 's hope the ratings will improve next year , though - certanly good ratings can never be bad for Star Trek 's future . <p> ' Gravity ' Final RatingsChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) Michael Iversen at the Star Trek Universe has posted the final ratings for last week 's Voyager episode , ' Gravity . ' Voyager did better than last week , though that was not very surprising considering last week 's horrendous ratings : <p> The final rating for last week 's Voyager is in , and it did a lot better than last week - Voyager got a 2.1 , and was nr. 90 along with UPN 's " Moesha " . Thats was a lot better than last week 's very low rating . Voyager was UPN 's highest rated show . ( Of course with " Moesha " ) <p> Starfleet Universe OpensChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) Actually it did a few days ago already , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at what this new Starfleet Command site promises : <p> Starfleet Universe is a new site dedicated to providing the Star Trek community with the very latest news , strategy , files and resources for Interplay Productions ' highly anticipated strategy game , " Starfleet Command " . <p> ... <p> Located at http : **28;1274;TOOLONG , Starfleet Universe aims to provide the latest news on Starfleet Command , as well as breaking news in the Star Trek gaming universe ! We do plan on adding new features/sections to the site including information pages such as FAQ 's &amp; strategy tips , a more comprehensive links section with additional links to clan sites &amp; all Starfleet Command related web sites and free sub hosting to Starfleet Command related web sites ! <p> Find the site here - it has already managed to put up lots of interesting news stories . <p> CGI animation is ... too clean , too calculating , and too easy . Without limitations on the animation , there are no reality checks . Anything you can draw , you can animate , and that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're too top-heavy or fragile to move correctly , they just look like they are . <p> ... <p> Stop the madness ! Bring back models ! Bring back matt drawings ! I do n't care that CGI is so much more convenient ! I do n't care that it 's cutting-edge art ! It looks dumb ! It makes the actors look dumb when they do n't turn to each other and say , " Geeze , this alien king dude looks like something from The Little Mermaid . " <p> Honestly , I 'd rather go back to handpuppets . The Horta in " Devil in the Dark " may have looked like a shag rug draped over a long-suffering actor , but at least it looked like a real shag rug , not a picture of one . <p> The full article can be found here - go and read it , Julia Houston definitely has a point . Models are a lot more romantic than CGI . <p> Pocket SpeaksChristian ( 3:46 pm CST ) Pocket Books editors John Ordover and Margaret Clark both updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at one question and answer from each of them : <p> Query from : Derek will this DS9 COMPANION be worth the money ? by which I mean will it give more than boring info , but things like : author reviews , behind the scenes stories , would-be plotting , behind the scenes stories , and behind the scenes stories ? and I assume it 's for the entire series . <p> Response from : Margaret Clark So I take it you want some behind the scene stories ? ? ? ? ? I can say for certain fact , that Terry Erdmann had become so much a fixture on the DS9 sets , that all I had to say was I was looking for Terry , and would get onto the set . The only excuse that has kept me from dragging Terry to New York and chaining him to a computer is , " You will not believe the stuff I am getting . It 's great , I 've got to go back and change/fix/beef-up " You get the point . I have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen anywhere else ! <p> Query from : Eric John- Sorry to post again , but I forgot one question . Can you tell us about Michael Jan Friedman 's new TNG hardcover for next year ? While I 'm writing , whose ideas were the cross-overs for next year ? For example : DH was yours and Michael Jan Friedman 's , and CT was yours and Dean Smith 's . Thanks , Eric <p> Response from : John Ordover It 's set on the Stargazer and deals with what happened when Picard first took command . Section 31 is Marco 's baby , and he 's working with Weddle and Thompson , the guys who created S31 for DS9 . The New Earth six-book series is me and Diane Carey . <p> UPN Spreading ' Academy ' RumoursChristian ( 3:45 pm CST ) I have received several reports of local UPN affiliates reporting about the ' Flight Academy ' rumours on their news shows . Almost certainly , these are just individual stations reporting about this due to a lack of ' real ' news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep in mind that the New York Post published an article yesterday which had Paramount deny that a ' Flight Academy ' series has even been under consideration . <p> The Sound Of Her Voice ChatChristian ( 3:45 pm CST ) Today at 9:00pm Eastern Time , a live interview will be held with Debra Wilson , most famous for her starring role on the MADtv series . Last year , however , she also starred as Captain Lisa Cusak in the sixth-season DS9 episode ' The Sound of her Voice . ' Info on how to attend the IRC chat can be found here . <p> Three of the others who attended the ceremonies were Ross Isaacs , Christian Moore , and Steve Long , my codesigners on the Star Trek : the Next Generation RPG , which won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game . Ross thanked Christian , and on Christian 's behalf thanked Christian 's parents , his partner Owen Seyler , LUG company honchos Bernie Cahill and Greg Orman , and on his own hook thanked the writers , and his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ross . I thanked Ross ( who , as STTNGRPG Line Developer , shepherded this project doggedly throughout ) and Chaosium , for giving me not only experience , but the chance to get to know Ross ( and hence , a slot on the Last Unicorn development team ) through my Nephilim work . <p> Find more in the full column .

All the screenshots are of more than excellent quality , and should definitely be checked out if you 're interested in the game . You can find them by going here .

Christian ( 3:44 pm CST ) Today is the 53rd birthday of Jay Chattaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the man who created " The Inner Light Suite , " which is quite probably the most beautiful piece of music ever created for Star Trek . <p> Find lots more at the Trek BBS , where you 're more than welcome to participate as well ! <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:43 pm CST ) Do read our Ron &amp; Brannon feature , people - some great content can be found there . And please excuse the rather weak title for the feature - unfortunately I did n't seem to be really inspired today . <p> Two events are predicted more often than any other in the world today : the end of the world and the end of Star Trek . This year , especially , prognosticators are predicting that both will come to pass with the start of the new millennium . I 'm going to put this bluntly : They 've never been right before , and they still are n't . <p> One of the most often-used pieces of evidence used to support the idea that Trek is on the way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will be a slightly different take on Trek 's last 12 years on TV -- While Trek 's weekly viewership has dropped off , the falling ratings can be attributed to many things other than falling popularity , and going by the ratings , the franchise is still healthy . <p> Read more in the full article and , after that , send in your comments to feedback@treknation.com so we can print them in the mailbag ! If all goes well there should actually be another edition of the mailbag tomorrow , btw . <p> ' Armada ' Story InfoChristian ( 4:11 pm CST ) YnrohKeeg at StarTrekGames.Net , still only accessible via the IP-address , has a short report up about the storyline of the upcoming ' Armada ' real-time strategy game . This report is apparently based on an Armada movie which was shown at the May Electronic Entertainment Expo : <p> The movie could not be heard over the din of E3 ( damn ! ) but it did reveal some of the story none the less . The story has something to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none other than Locutus ! Well wait you say , they rescued Picard did'nt they ? Well in the movie the Enterprise is sent out to get talk to ? see about ? the Borg ( could not tell due to no audio ) . You see the Enterprise pull up and then there is a computer-rendering of the E 's bridge and major characters at their stations . Picard opens up communications with the Borg and up on the view screen pops Locutus ; Picards mouth then proceeds to hang WIDE open . DAMN not being able to hear ! There were then some shots of various races battling each other and the Borg and that 's about it . <p> The next " Star Trek " series is already on the drawing board and could hit the air by 2002 . <p> Veteran " Star Trek " writer Brannon Braga and series executive producer Rick Berman are in the early stages of a new series , according to officials at Paramount - the studio that produces the TV show and films . <p> After that the article goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to be ' bogus ' by an official Paramount spokesperson . Rather interesting is the fact that the article mentions the 2002 date twice , which certainly is a lot further away than many people were thinking . What would Braga and Berman actually do with three years development time , by the way ? The other series never took that long ! In any case , find the full article here . <p> The prototype , based on the Saavik body and Janeway head , features the corrected rank insignia on the shoulder and wrist , the correct department color on the collar , and the red stripes on the pant legs ( a detail omitted from all other figures featuring this era uniform ) . <p> Definitive price and date of availability have still not been determined as of yet , but New Force owner , Rick Whitelock , is aiming for an $8.99 per figure cost and a 4th Quarter , 1999 release date . <p> " Equinox " is a good example of Voyager using action and story themes that play best to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series still does n't seem to fly on its own identity , and I 'm doubting it ever will . It flies on isolated plots and often the skillful reapplication of ideas from other Trek series . Last week 's " Warhead " was a perfect example . There 's nothing really wrong with the reapplication of new material ( if done with inspiration , which " Warhead " alas was n't ) , but there 's nothing fresh about it either . <p> Now we have " Equinox , " which brings back a number of familiar themes previously explored exclusively on Voyager--themes that I personally wish were more prevalent on this series . Themes that remind us we 're in the Delta Quadrant , removed from Starfleet and its safe haven ( although considering the war in the Alpha Quadrant , " safe haven " probably is n't accurate these days ) --and possibly removed from its rules given certain circumstances . <p> The full review , in which Jamahl awards the episode 3 out of 4 stars , can be found by clicking this link . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The people at Decipher , the publisher of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game , just put up the winning deck from last week 's Origins event , which also featured a CCG championship . You can see which deck was used by winner David Bowling by going here ! <p> More On Jeri Ryan Top 50 AppearanceChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) Yesterday I reported about the new edition of Visual Imaginations ' Cult Times magazine , which apparently features a ' Top 50 Feisty Fantasy Females ' list . According to the Official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage , &gt;Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) appeared twice on this list , which was rather surprising to me . Jay was kind enough to write in to inform me that one listing was for her role as Juliet Stuart in Dark Skies ( at No.29 ) , while her Seven of Nine role landed her the first place . Thanks go out to Jay for sending this in ! <p> Trek Book NewsChristian ( 3:51 pm CST ) At his books Q&amp;A , Pocket Books editor John Ordover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the below rather interesting two : <p> Query from : Andrew John:How well did the deep space nine finale sell in stores ? Did it do as good as the DS9 rebels trilogy ? <p> Response from : John Ordover Yes , about the same . It 's the finale , after all . <p> Query from : Brent Are you planning any Voyager books that feature the Doctor or at least have him on the cover ? It seems that with most books he is just left as almost a background character without having much influence on the plot ( although I see why this may be , considering that most books are point of view , and it would be kind of hard to do the point of view of a hologram ) . Also , I just wanted to say thanks for answering all of these questions everyday , and I am really looking forward to Christie Golden 's Dark Matter VGR trilogy . <p> Response from : John Ordover The Doctor is a problem , not just because of the POV problem you point out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing a medical story , he 's hard to work with . <p> The last answer certainly is strange to say the least . That would seem to suggest that the books are purely built on action and violence , which is n't exactly how I like to think about the Star Trek novels . More can be found at the actual Q&amp;A Board . <p> Cirroc Lofton Chat TonightChristian ( 3:50 pm CST ) At 8:00pm Eastern Time , TV Guide will be hosting a live chat with Cirroc Lofton and Dan Lauria , stars of the new ' The Hoop Life ' show .

This time , she 's managed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green about Voyager 's sixth season : <p> Mulgrew sat down with executive producer Brannon Braga before shooting started to discuss some of her hopes for Janeway . " My great wishes for this season ... I really want a featured episode with Roxann Dawson , who plays B'Elanna Torres and one with Bob Picardo , who plays the Doctor , where they are integral to what 's happening not only on the ship , but with me , " she revealed . " I have a very close personal relationship with both of them , those two , and I feel that Roxann has suffered a bit in the past year .

The goal is to utilize the full capabilities of the starship to engage and destroy your enemy and complete the objectives . Recently I was privileged to obtain a copy of the E3 preview of Starfleet Command . <p> Starfleet Command , set in the time period of Star Trek : The Original Series , is a real time strategy simulation that is loosely based on the Starfleet Battles board game . Even if you have never played Starfleet Battles or are unfamiliar with the Star Trek universe altogether , you will find Starfleet Command to be an extremely robust and precise space combat simulation . <p> Nimoy Voices ' Computer Graphics'Christian ( 3:50 pm CST ) The Boycott against Yahoo ! has ended , so now I can link to their stories again . According to a ' Showbiz People Briefs ' article at Yahoo ! , Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) will soon be voicing a new documentary called ' The Story of Computer Graphics .

Aug. 8 at the Shrine Auditorium , will be free to the public after the confab 's attendees are admitted . <p> Today On TVChristian ( 3:49 pm CST ) -At 9:00pm , UPN will be repeating Voyager 's ' Bliss . ' Take a look at the official Paramount description : <p> Finally , after five long years , an exhilarated crew of the U.S.S. Voyager finds a wormhole that will bring them back to the Alpha Quadrant . As the happy crew prepares to return to Earth , a skeptical Seven of Nine violates captain 's orders and enlists The Doctor , little Naomi Wildman and an alien pilot , Qatai , to help her stop the ship from entering the wormhole . <p> Thanks go out to the Continuum for the description and the image , which is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 11:00pm Eastern Time , the Sci-Fi Channel will be showing the TOS episode ' I , Mudd .

At 18:00 tomorrow , BBC Two will be showing DS9 's ' The Homecoming , ' followed 45 minutes later by ' The Circle , ' which is extremely great , as I 've seen both episodes only once . <p> Hello World ! Christian ( 3:45 pm CST ) It was only with great difficulty that I was able to drag myself away from " The Guns of Navarone " to do this update - they simply do n't make films like that anymore . I 'm taping the second half of the movie ( which is shown on Dutch television at the moment ) , and perhaps if I 'm not too tired I might actually see the conclusion later on tonight - I just *love* classic war movies . <p> Tuesday July 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pm CST ) After last week 's excellent first installment in our series of " The Franchise 's Future " articles , we 're now very proud to be able to present you with the second article ! This time , the author of the article is Jim Wright , famous for his Delta Blues Voyager reviews and his columns in the Starfleet Journal . Jim Wright is a bit more positive than Jeff Koga was last week , though he does believe that it might be a good thing for the franchise if Voyager 's sixth season would be the last : <p> I 'm not a day trader . I invest for the long term . If Voyager is canceled , the biggest impact for me is I get my weekends back . Would I miss it ? Yes . I think it 's better than many people give it credit for , though it is certainly far from perfect and the Ron Moore rumors are disconcerting . But I do n't place in Voyager 's hands the fate of the Franchise , and I wo n't lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive . It may lie dormant for a time ; it could use the rest . After a time , it will peek out from its lair and not see its shadow , and the winter of our discontent will give way to the spring of a new generation of excited , eager Trek fans . Those who have seen the Franchise at its best and worst , have assimilated and debated each hour to the nth degree , and who are eager to press forward with a confidence that the best of Trek is yet to come . <p> The full article can be found here . As last week , please send in all your comments about the article to feedback@treknation.com so we can publish it in the mailbag ! If things go the way they 're currently going , the mailbag might actually be published twice weekly , btw - we were quite literally flooded with mail over yesterday 's ' Defending Braga ' article . I 'm not complaining , of course : - ) . <p> Next week 's installment will be written by Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , and a good friend of Jim Wright . <p> Sid co-stars with Chris O'Donnell in next summer 's Vertical Limit . We first broke the news about Sid 's next project in June , and now we begin our coverage of filming . Look for more information as it becomes available ! <p> Sid left for New Zealand on June 30 to begin a month of training . Filming begins August 2 . Sid 's role is that of the leader of the rescue team heading up K2 , the world 's second highest mountain . Sid 's character is Pakistani . <p> According to the site , other cast members include Robin Tunney , Bill Paxton , Nicholas Lea , and Scott Glenn . A lot more can be found on the special Sid City Vertical Limit page , which will undoubtedly be updated regularly over the coming months . <p> More On The BotF PatchChristian ( 3:19 pm CST ) Federation HQ , a rather superb Trek gaming news site , has posted some extra information on the ' Birth of the Federation ' patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beta test program for the new patch , which is how they were able to get this info . Take a look at the enhancements the patch will provide : <p> You can now install the music files to your hard drive in order to reduce CD-ROM access . This requires an additional 76MB of hard drive space . <p> If you do a complete install of the game ( by copying the music files to your hard drive ) , then you can " spawn " the game for multiplayer games over a LAN . <p> The scroll speed on the Main Galactic map has been increased . <p> You can now turn off the Borg but keep the rest of the random events . <p> The Solar System Inventory window is now alphabetized . <p> Turn processing time has been improved . <p> There will also be several bug fixes , which are listed on the Federation HQ news page . Microprose should really be thanked for these enhancements , btw - certainly the ' spawning ' option will be extremely helpful for me . <p> Star Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unofficial fan site of Nicole deBoer ( Ezri Dax ) , has put an interview which first appeared in the July 1999 edition of the British Star Trek Monthly Magazine . In the interview , which was written by Ian Spelling , deBoer talks about the fact that she was used rather a lot over the past year : <p> " They 'd say , ' Yeah , it 's all about you . ' I 'd say , ' Oh , no , ' and they 'd say , ' What ? You 're not happy about it ? ' I 'd say , ' It 's just too much . People are going to hate me . ' I was really concerned about it , but then that part of the season passed and they started doing stuff with the other characters . I just really wanted them to incorporate Ezri into storylines that people want to see going on as the show 's finishing up , as opposed to totally separate storylines just about Ezri . I thought it was important to do a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they then started really focusing on the other characters as well and , as we got towards the end , they mostly gave me bits and pieces with Worf Michael Dorn and Julian Alexander Siddig , so I was happy about that . " <p> The full text of the interview can be found here , while scanned pictures from the magazine can be found here . <p> Jeri Ryan In VisimagsChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) The official Jeri Lynn Ryan Homepage is reporting that the new edition of the British Cult Times magazine features a list of " Fifty Feisty Fantasy Females , " and Jeri Ryan ( Seven Of Nine ) is apparently featured *twice* on that list ( No , I do n't know how that 's possible either ) . A picture of Jeri Ryan from that article is actually available via the JLR Homepage 's news site . In related news , the new edition of Starburst Magazine ( also published by Visual Imaginations Publications ) features an exclusive artcard showing Jeri Ryan , which they 're giving away to celebrate reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doherty , who has contributed to Star Trek : Voyager with teleplays such as season four 's " Vis a Vis " as well as last season 's " Infinite Regress " and " Bliss , " has been brought on-board the show as a staff writer . Robert - who served as Ken Biller 's assistant up until Ken left the show at the end of last season - will most likely join the staff as a story editor , helping to fill the void left by the sudden departure of Ronald D. Moore last week . It still remains to be seen if this is or will be the only staff addition . Someone may yet be brought in as a co-executive producer , the position Ron vacated : stay tuned . <p> The full report also contains a few statements from Steve Krutzler about the history of the Ron Moore affaire , presumably in reaction to Valentine Winter 's article defending Brannon Braga . <p> With Deep Space Nine ending and half the cast reportedly unwilling to participate in future Star Trek movies , how are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although not firmly out of the running , is pretty darned expensive , and Brent Spiner has said he would rather not force Data to age along with Spiner himself . And the situation is worse over on DS9 : Avery Brooks and Nana Visitor , the two stars of the series , are n't interested in the big screen . Which still leaves quite a lot of possibilities , albeit not the obvious ones . <p> So what the heck ? If they want to make a Star Trek X movie ( which is like asking if they want to continue to eat food and live indoors ) , who SHOULD they use ? <p> In the end Johnson comes up with a rather surprising crew ( Captain Riker ? Dr. Pulaski ? ) , but it 's still a fun article . Find it all here . <p> New German Tom Paris ConfirmedChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) According to the German Active Trekkies , the new German voice-over actor for Tom Paris in ' Star Trek : Voyager ' is a certain Erich RSuker . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS9 . The previous voice actor , Thomas Vogt , apparently did n't want to do the job anymore after he came back from a holiday in South-America . ( And I do hope I translated that well - neither German nor English is my native language ) <p> Wedding Report In People MagazineChristian ( 3:17 pm CST ) According to AnotherUniverse 's Daily Buzz , the July 5 issue of People Magazine contains an article about the wedding of Kate Mulgrew ( Janeway ) and politician Tim Hagan . The article is apparently part of a ' Celebrity Wedding ' feature , and is written in a " He Said , She Said " format : <p> " I have no interest in Hollywood . I knew she was an actress but had never seen her in anything , " said Hagan of their first meeting . " I 'm an agnostic on many of my days , but when I laid eyes on her I said , ' There is a God . ' " <p> Mulgrew reported that they had champagne immediately after the 15-minute ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne . <p> According to the original report , the People article is accompanied by a nuptial photo of Mulgrew and Hagan , which should certainly make it worth buying . <p> As part of the co-branding agreement , SCI FI Channel 's SCIFI.COM site will feature links to a co-branded version of CityAuction , where buyers can bid on auction merchandise associated with their sci-fi favorites , such as Star Wars , X-Files , Twilight Zone and Star Trek . Sellers of sci-fi collectibles will also be able to capitalize CityAuction 's growing market of sci-fi fans . CityAuction , in turn , will feature links from its sci-fi category to SCIFI.COM , so fans can find relevant information on sci-fi news , feature stories , merchandise games and special events . <p> The full press release can be found here .

Christian ( 3:15 pm CST ) Has everyone noticed that since about two weeks there 's a lovely ' poll ' feature at the right hand of the screen ? Every two days or so I refresh the poll to deal with a different Star Trek subject to vote on , and you might like to participate as well . The current poll deals with the question if Brannon Braga should leave Voyager or not , which certainly seems to be a hot topic these days . If you missed the poll , please scroll up and vote - the current results are interesting to say the least : - ) . <p> Monday July 5 , 1999 <p> Defending Brannon BragaChristian ( 4:07 pm CST ) At the Trek Nation , we just put a featured article defending Voyager Executive Producer Brannon Braga . Over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather serious attacks , and new Trek Nation contributor Valentine Winter decided to write in an defend Braga . In his article , he looks at the various rumours that appeared over the past two weeks , and uncovers some rather interesting things which would seem to make all the reports a little bit less reliable : <p> Unfortunately , the attacks on Braga 's performance as Executive Producer seem to originate solely from internet fandom , which has always had a rather strained relationship with him . It seems to me that many people who still held a grudge against Braga now saw the perfect opportunity to damage him in public . <p> It really was no great surprise to me to find several Usenet postings by this aforementioned ' recook77 ' fellow , in which he mentions that Braga ' really does n't seem to give a sh*t about Voyager ' , suggests that the only reason Braga came as far as he did would be if he had kinky snapshots of Paramount executives , and in which he calls Braga sexist . How much trust can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an e-mail from an acquaintance ' who supposedly knows everything about " secret meetings " organized by Braga ? <p> Lots more can be found in the full article , which I really recommend you check out ! Major thanks go out to Valentine Winter for writing up this article - if all goes as planned , you should be seeing his name at the Trek Nation a lot in the future . As usual , if you have anything to say about the article , please send it to feedback@treknation.com so we can print in the mailbag ! <p> Update - 10:50 CET : In light of the major upheaval that this article seems to have caused , please do remember that just because we publish an article , it does n't necessarily mean we also agree with the article . If anyone wants to write a ' Why Braga Should Go ' article , we 'd be more than happy to publish it as well , if you send it in . <p> I think it is still striking chords with people , but I think it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen will be what happened before : it disappears for a while , and then resurfaces . I do n't know . I do think that everything works in cycles , and the way that people rediscovered Star Trek . They may have to rediscover it again . <p> Sigh . Are there actually any people left who still think the franchise has a life left in it ? The full interview , as written by Paul Simpson , can be found by actually buying DreamWatch . Thanks go out to Gustavo Leao for this ! <p> News From The LotChristian ( 3:50 pm CST ) I just received a report from someone who often visits the Paramount lot , who gave me some extra info on ' Fifteen Minutes , ' the upcoming movie starring Avery Brooks ( Benjamin Sisko ) : <p> It is film about an arsonist . Brooks appears to be playing an investigator/policeman of some sort . <p> The main star of the movie is Robert DeNiro , as we already reported a while ago . I also received the following info : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaked me out ! <p> Major thanks go out to the person who sent this in ! ( And yes , he wishes to remain anonymous , if you had n't guessed ; - ) <p> BotF ReviewChristian ( 3:49 pm CST ) Derek Meyer at GamesFirst ! has written a review of ' Birth of the Federation , ' the new turn-based strategy game , awarding it four stars : <p> Star Trek Birth of the Federation provides a fresh update to a classic strategy game . Not only will the game appeal to Star Trek fans , but also to hardcore strategy gamers who enjoy space based games and empire building . Finally , there is a Star Trek game that is worthy of the name . <p> " We 'd finished the fight and Mike said , ' Cut ! ' There I am lying on the floor on my back and it 's hard for us Klingons to get up because our costumes are so heavy . " Michael Dorn was listening to some conversation across the room and I 'm saying , ' Michael ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere except where my voice is coming from . There I am , like a turtle squirming on its back , yelling , ' Hey , Michael ! Help me up ! ' Once he got me up I said , ' Boy , see how quick you forget the ex-emperor . ' He and I got a big kick out of that . " <p> " We had a good time filming that day even though it was a very long shoot . I think I got there at seven in the morning and did n't leave until two the next morning , but I en- enjoyed myself . What made the day even more special is that it was the first time my wife came to the set . She has a very busy life and with the children the couple have two-year- old triplets it 's almost impossible to make plans , but we got her there that day . She was an actress years ago so she 's used to the whole filming process , but I was just delighted for her to finally be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sound Of Her VoiceChristian ( 3:48 pm CST ) Kevin Day just posted to **25;1304;TOOLONG about a live chat with Debra Wilson , which will be taking place on Thursday at 6:00pm Pacific Time . Wilson is apparently most famous for her role on MadTV , though she also appeared as Captain Lisa Cusak on DS9 's ' The Sound Of Her Voice . ' More on the chat can be found here . <p> Just wanted to let everyone know , the beta patch has been released for the testers by Microprose - no enhancements at this point , just bugs patched . Should know how this baby shakes out in the next few days . <p> Hopefully the public patch will then also be coming out in a few days - I 'm getting rather tired of the slowdown problems with the game . <p> Interplay Releases SFC SoundtrackChristian ( 3:47 pm CST ) The good people at Interplay have released 11 tracks from the musical score of ' Starfleet Command , ' their new strategy game . The game music has been conducted and composed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Best of Both Worlds , ' Interplay 's ' Starfleet Academy ' game , and presumably also ' Klingon Academy .

Thanks go out to TrekWeb for the soundtrack link . <p> New ' Voyager : Elite Force ' ScreenshotChristian ( 3:46 pm CST ) GA-Source has put up three screenshots of Raven Software 's upcoming ' Voyager : Elite Force ' game . The screenshots are part of a sort of mini-preview of the game , which sums up all the features and talks a bit about the Quake III engine , which ' Elite Force ' will be using . Unfortunately only one screenshot is new ( the one you also see here ) , but a full-sized version can be found by visiting this page . <p> New Summer Sweepstakes PrizeChristian ( 3:46 pm CST ) I just noticed the Grand Prize for the Continuum 's Super Sweepstakes has changed - last month , you could win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Grand Prize winner will fly to Los Angeles and receive accommodations for two nights at the Universal City Hilton , dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe , Universal Studios Tour , VIP Tour of Paramount Studios and a visit to a set of Star Trek : Voyager .

Yesterday evening we had lots of rain and lightning , and unfortunately this caused something here in the house to short-circuit . Unfortunately I have n't yet found out what precisely was the cause , meaning that half of the house is still without electricity : - ( . I 'm actually typing this purely in the light of my monitor , as the room light is on the power circuit that refuses to work . It 's getting fixed tomorrow morning , which is just as well , as I doubt my eyes will be able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 1999 <p> First MailbagChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) On a day where there is an exceptionally low amount of news , I 'm extremely happy to present you with the first edition of the Trek Nation mailbag ! The mailbag is the place where you ( you ! ) can write in to let the world know about anything at all Star Trek or TrekToday-related ! In the first edition , we have a mail about the ' Flight Academy ' rumours , a few miscellaneous bits about the ads on TrekToday , lots of reactions to Jeff Koga 's " The Franchise 's Future " editorial . We also received lots of mail about the Voyager cancellation rumours , including this very interesting mail from Richard Rafter : <p> What Lord Spock is saying comes as no real surprise . My cousin has worked on several projects at the studio . He hold in a phone conversation that the suits had not signed off on anything past Christmas and informed the writers to close loose threads . Since the creative team is nowhere near ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strictly economic decision . Due largely of course to UPN 's failing market share . <p> Note that Lord Spock mentioned yesterday that at least the sixth season is safe now , but it is still interesting to hear about this from someone else . Also remember that none of this has been confirmed yet - please just treat this as any other online rumour . Lots more about all of this can be found in the full mailbag ! Remember that if you want to say anything at all about recent Star Trek happenings , please send it in to feedback@treknation.com so we can print it in the mailbag ! <p> Also , I received lots of mail over the past day about my comments that " it might actually be a good thing for the franchise if Voyager is cancelled , because I 'm not sure if Voyager can still be saved ratings-wise . " Let me just explain that I most certainly do not hate Voyager - I actually rather like the series , though I do n't think it 's as good as Deep Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as no one will be able to deny , simply *are* bad - and unfortunately I 'm not sure anymore if Voyager 's ratings will be able to improve . In that sense , perhaps a new series would be able to achieve higher ratings , though it would of course also be an enourmous loss for all us Voyager fans . <p> Roxann Dawson Convention ReportChristian ( 4:18 pm CST ) B3 Prime , the official fan club of Roxann Dawson ( B'Elanna Torres ) , has put up a report of the SciFi Expo convention in Plano , Texas . The convention took place on the 27th and 28th of March , and was also attended by Dawson . The report contains a bit about the Q&amp;A with Dawson : <p> Among the questions she was asked were what were her thoughts on the phenomenon known as Paris/Torres fan fic ( she demurred from answering ) ; if her wig had changed ( no , the color has n't changed , but the length and style are changing , and a new look will be unveiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long filming an episode takes ( she highlighted certain problems with receiving completed scripts ) ; and if she wanted to go back to theatre ( Roxann discussed the thrill of being the first and the last person to portray A Chorus Line 's Diana Morales ) . <p> More can be found in the full report , written by Angela C. Boeckman and Greg Walker . <p> I have received Packaging approval from Viacom/Paramount and I have received approval on the prototype figure .

One of the interviews is with Armin Shimerman ( Quark ) , and the TV Zone people were kind enough to put up a preview online . Take a look at a part of that interview : <p> Michael Piller was keen to develop what I would call three-dimensional characters , " continues Shimerman . " Their three-dimensionality was highlighted by the fact that the characters were good and bad . They were problematical in the sense that there were things about them that were n't especially nice . Kira Nana Visitor , for instance , besides being a terrific officer , was also a Bajoran nationalist if it was n't good for Bajor , then it was n't good , period . It took a long time for her to see things from a Federation perspective and not strictly a Bajoran one . When Sisko Avery Brooks was first assigned to DS9 he was n't exactly thrilled and it took a while for him to appreciate his situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual leader , the Emissary . Our characters had deeper and darker qualities that you never really saw in the crews of the original Star Trek , TNG and now , Star Trek : Voyager .

' Today he does n't seem to have any such reservations left , as he 's posted a huge report looking at precisely what happened that caused Ron Moore to leave . <p> The story goes into precise detail about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , and appears mostly based on a report which was posted to Usenet . It also contains a few deeply personal attacks at Berman and Braga , which in my opinion should never ever have been posted . You can find the full report here , though it 's certainly not pretty , and will make you loose a lot of your faith in Star Trek . Please do remember that Ron Moore 's reasons have still not been officially stated , and that this looks more like a few cheap attacks which are just damaging to everyone involved . <p> Trek ToysChristian ( 3:56 pm CST ) Eon'sJeff Bond just put up an editorial looking at the increasing commercialization of toys , and then especially of the Star Wars figures . According to him , however , Trek toys are still fun to buy , because the franchise is n't ' cool ' anymore : <p> There 's one saving grace in all this , and I hate to say it , but it 's the cult that started all this in the first place . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine . It 's no longer cool . There 's only one STAR TREK TV show on the air and nobody likes it . And the original series , the one I loved from childhood on , is the uncoolest STAR TREK of all . It 's forgotten and gathering dust , its banner barely held up by one disrespected toy company , Playmates . <p> Playmates understocks and barely seems to be able to get its product distributed around the country . You actually have to DIG and be sneaky to find Playmates product . You have to fight with people and bribe managers at Target and Kay-Bee toys to obtain these toys . There are still people doing this same thing religiously to get their Darth Mauls and their Jar Jars , but the difference is , all those people have to do is wait a few more weeks before that crap will be clogging remainder shelves everywhere . If I miss out on buying a 9 " Trelaine from " The Squire of Gothos " at Kay-Bee this month , I 'll wind up having to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3:55 pm CST ) Lord Spock just sent in an update to the Voyager cancellation story , which he first reported on a few days ago . As then , huge disclaimers still apply - this is only one source , and it most certainly has not been confirmed yet . Still , take a look at this : <p> Paramount has given the okay to a full 26 episode season for season six . However , rumours indicate that Paramount has told Voyager writers to tie up loose ends and get ready to quickly write a series finale for the end of season six . <p> As I said before , if Voyager does indeed get cancelled it might actually be a good thing for the franchise . I 'm not sure if Voyager can still be saved ratings-wise , and perhaps it would be better if the show would just get replaced by a great new ( Star Trek ) series . Of course , if you have a different opinion , please send it in to feedback@treknation.com , so we can use it in tomorrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wedding VowChristian ( 3:55 pm CST ) The people at the Daily Sci-Fi just announced the winners of their " Spock 's Wedding Vow " contest , where people could submit creative and humorous wedding vows that could have been said at Saavik 's and Spock 's wedding . The winner would be receiving a signed copy of " Vulcan 's Heart , ' the new novel chronicling that wedding . Take a look at the winning vow : <p> " Mr. Spock , do you promise to make Saavik your cold and ineffectual wife , to have every seven years or so , to not hold unless trudging dramatically through the snow , in pon farr and in health , until one of you gets Bendii syndrome and croaks ? <p> Trek Actors At Anti-Matter FactoryChristian ( 3:54 pm CST ) An article by Arnout Jaspers in the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad ( the ' General Daily ' ) talks about an anti-matter ' factory ' which will soon be opening near Geneva , Switzerland . The article quotes researcher Rolf Landau , who mentions that he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This experiment is still very far from what happens in Star Trek , but it 's a good way to draw in the public 's attention .

" Prof " Smith . Will this be an excerpt from the PROTON book , or a new story just for the magazine ? <p> Response from : John Ordover It 's the first chapter in a Captain Proton serial that will have the second chapter in our Captain Proton book. : ) <p> Response from : John Ordover It might , but -- you know , you 'll just have to read it to understand . It 's not so much =what happens= in these stories and the serial but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'm not exactly that happy with this turn of events , considering Amazing Stories is n't sold here in the Netherlands , as far as I know . Find more Ordover answers at his Q&amp;A board . <p> Continuum ChatsChristian ( 3:54 pm CST ) Blush ! Shame ! On Thursday , I reported Patrick Stewart would be chatting at the Continuum . Unfortunately , it appears I mis-read the date , and Stewart wo n't be chatting until about a month from now , on the 29th of July . The Continuum did announce one other chat - namely with Robert Duncan McNeill on the 22nd of July . Sorry for the huge mistake with the Stewart chat . <p> ' Free Enterprise ' Soundtrack ReviewChristian ( 3:53 pm CST ) The new edition of Eon Magazine contains a review of the soundtrack of ' Free Enterprise , ' the independent movie starring William Shatner . The review contains the following rather nice tidbit about how Shatner 's contribution to the soundtrack actually came into being : <p> I had the life-affirming pleasure of actually watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to watch Shatner rap , perform Shakespeare , and do some classic Captain Kirk acting moves while he pretended to be stabbed by members of the rap group on stage . It 's for that reason that I ca n't give a clear-eyed review of this CD : for an old Trekkie like myself , it just marks too awe-inspiring a life experience . Trust Shatner to not only embrace the ludicrousness of the concept but to somehow , against all hope , make it strangely bracing and cool . There 's also a hidden track here buried at the end of the CD which sets a deleted Shatner monologue to music in highly amusing fashion , and a lexicon of politically incorrect pop culture " Ebionics " ( some of which do not show up in the movie ) that are pretty funny . All in all , it 's a damned good party album , and what good party album should n't end with William Shatner rapping ? <p> Well , I guess it was bound to happen . After belting out an impressive series hits ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollercoaster Tycoon , Mechwarrior III ) worthy of their glory days , Microprose has finally tripped with Birth of the Federation . I guess if there was any game that could so completely take the wind out of Microprose 's sails , it would have been one based on a Star Trek license . <p> In the end , Erhardt ends up awarding the game just two stars in his full review . He is a lot more positive about the strategy guide , which he has also reviewed : <p> Geez , talk about a rock and a hard place . If you 've already read my review of BotF , then you may be confused about my rating on the Strategy Guide above . The problem here is that we have a really good strategy guide for a really bad game , and that 's about as perfect a conundrum as ever comes down the pike . <p> The full review is quite probably the only review of the strategy guide to have appeared on the net - you can find it here . <p> Happy Birthdays ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday of Kurtwood Smith , who guest starred as Annorax in Voyager 's ' Year of Hell .

Take a look at some of the active threads : <p> Hello World ! Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! I spent most of the day outside enjoying the sun , and only got in to update TrekToday when it became too dark . Tomorrow I 'll try preparing parts of the update in the morning - hopefully that 'll mean an earlier update , but with this wonderful weather I 'm not guaranteeing anything ; - ) . <p> Coaxial is now able to confirm that these reports are accurate : Ron Moore is leaving Voyager &amp; there were " issues " between Moore and Braga . Something had to give , and now Moore is gone . <p> The full report can be found here . Thanks go out to TrekWeb for the link . <p> Voyager Hack Job UpdateChristian ( 4:28 pm CST ) Vidiot just updated his Voyager Hack Job page again , this time including information on which scenes were hacked out of ' Bride of Chaotica ' in order to get more commercial time . In total , 2 minutes and 6 seconds were removed from the episode , while six seconds were added to the ep . The Voyager Hack Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also contains a plea from Vidiot himself for less commercials . <p> On a few occasions this summer , according to Ultimate TV , Sci-Fi has decided to air the original series episodes according to recurring themes . ... Klingons will be at the forefront from July 26th-29th , when " Errand of Mercy , " " Friday 's Child , " " The Trouble with Tribbles , " and " Day of the Doves " air . But the theme which will have yours truly tuned in is Shatner In Love , which features Jim Kirk hamming it up with a love interest in " The City on the Edge of Forever , " " The Gamesters of Triskelion , " " Elaan of Troyius , " and " Whom Gods Destroy . " <p> I 'm rather surprised they did n't go for a Shatner In Love Month instead - surely the Original Series would have enough material to sustain that : - ) ?

Reasons for this are speculated to be that there were too many shows competing for the same audience ( as many as 22 programs at one point ) , and that the overseas market for American hour-long action-drama series has been soft with foreign broadcasters playing local programing rather than such fare . <p> Quake II Trek ConversionChristian ( 4:23 pm CST ) Andrew Wyllie , who also created the Star Trek ' Total Conversion ' for Quake I , has released version 1.1 of his Quake II conversion .

There are a few things I might still like to add or change , but I 've kept everyone waiting long enough already , so here it is in its current state . I hope you enjoy it , and feel free to send me your comments . <p> The Gamesdomain review does n't contain a score , though the reviewer rightfully points out the most interesting part of the game is the beginning . <p> After having played the game myself , I can definitely recommend it , at least for the first 200 turns .

Is that hot or what ? <p> The sheets are from the recent press run of the expansion set , estimated to release in late July . All 130 cards of the set ( 50 Rare , 40 Uncommon and 40 Common ) are included in the three-sheet set . Do n't look for foil cards - that 's a separate print job and it 's not included in the prize .

I do hope the show will have even one ratings point left by the end of the summer ... <p> German Voyager ScheduleChristian ( 3:22 pm CST ) The people at the German Star Trek Index just put up the German air schedule for the third season , which is running again at Sat.1 . In the new schedule , two episodes are shown every Saturday , from 15:00 to 17:00 , while some episodes are n't repeated anymore the day after . Detailed info on the new schedule can be found here . <p> I know I 'm not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm guessing I 'm also not the only one who likes to snicker at them occasionally . It 's such a risk to project into the future , and it 's so easy , looking at these films decades later , to feel superior about their erroneous views on " what might happen . " Of course , we 're really as clueless now as " they " were then about what the real year 2300 will be like . But that does n't prevent a great satisfaction and sense of superiority being gained from knowing that " they " were wrong . <p> In truth , however , such films reflect not our true projections of the future , but a depiction of the future which will hopefully sell tickets , a depiction of the future that maintains what we like about our society and changes what we do n't like . As a consequence , sci-fi films of the ' 50s typically have much more in common with Leave it to Beaver than they do with any real scientific analysis . Anti-intellectualism , anti-communism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who destroyed themselves in the search for Truth , daring young capitalists who triumphed over alien invasions , and female crew members who were always either botanists or biologists . <p> What , then , will the future conclude about our time when they look at Star Trek ? <p> Insurrection On Pay-Per-ViewChristian ( 3:21 pm CST ) According to the Flagship , ' Star Trek : Insurrection ' will be shown on various pay-per-view channels in the month of July . The first channel to be reported about is ' DirectTV , ' which will apparently be showing the film in a letterboxed and dolby-digital version . <p> Fans of Star Trek 's alien looks and the work of designer Michael Westmore can meet him and see his Star Trek work in person at a show sponsored by Make-Up Artist Magazine in Pasadena over the July 24-25 weekend .

A new article by People Magazine'sSandy Nicholson looks at the recent career moves of Kevin Sorbo , who until recently starred as ' Hercules ' on the series with the same name . In the article , he talks about his family live , and his decision to quit Hercules in favour of a new syndicated sci-fi series based on the works of the late Gene Roddenberry . You can find the full article here . <p> Convention ArticleChristian ( 3:18 pm CST ) A new article at the LA Weekly web site , written by Athima Chansanchai , takes a look at the phenomenon of science-fiction conventions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rather lucrative deal for the celebrities : <p> For a weekend gig at a sci-fi convention , actors are paid appearance fees ranging anywhere from $500 to $40,000 -- the high-end rate for headliners . The average is between $7,500 and $10,000 . Some actors supplement their income by charging willing fans $5 to $20 for an autograph . Other duties of the celebs include participating in Q&amp;A sessions and sometimes hosting auctions . <p> With convention registration running sometimes as high as $75 for coveted reserved seating ( to get a better place in line for autographs ) -- regular admission starts around $17 -- and with attendance of up to 5,000 fans ( for Creation Con 's Pasadena Grand Slam in April ) , getting in on the action can be quite lucrative . <p> The full article also contains a few quotes from George Takei ( Hikaru Sulu ) , one of the most active convention celebrities .

Christian ( 3:16 pm CST ) Sorry for the ad banner at the top of the page - unfortunately it became necessary to cover the costs of the Trek Nation . I really love how TrekToday and Trek BBS ( not to mention the hosted sites Warp Eleven and ST-Hypertext ) have been able to get extremely popular , but unfortunately that does come with high bandwidth costs - and the Nation 's growth does n't seem to be stopping at least for the near future . I do hope your enjoyment of the site wo n't be completely destroyed by the ads - and perhaps you 'll even find something useful by clicking on them : - ) . <p> ( Of course , if you disagree with this , or have something to say about anything else Trek Today / Trek Nation-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print in the mailbag ; - ) <p> Details on what can actually be found in those books can be found at Clark 's Q&amp;A Board . <p> ' Starfleet Academy ' Rumour ReappearsChristian ( 3:44 pm CST ) Mr. Showbiz just put up a rather interesting report by Jeffrey Wells about the future of the Star Trek franchise . His report deals with the fact that Patrick Stewart is apparently getting both too expensive ( $14 million ) and too irritating ( script input ) to be used in future movies , especially now that Insurrection 's performance was so disappointing . The solution will apparently be to get rid of Stewart : <p> Word is that veteran Trek scribe Brannon Braga and series producer Rick Berman are penning a two-hour pilot for a new Trek TV series that may be used as the basis of the next Trek feature . Tongue-in-cheeky insiders are referring to the new Trek project , allegedly a kind of Top Gun plot revolving around the Starfleet Academy , as take your pick Buffy , the Starfleet Officer ; Ten Things I Hate About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , I 'm told , is Star Trek : Flight Academy . ( Does n't this sound like a Steve Guttenberg movie ? ) <p> The days of Star Trek : Voyager and Deep Space Nine , both Paramount-produced TV series , are on the wane . Paramount publicist Blaise Noto acknowledges that a new series is being developed . I 'm told that the Braga-Berman Top Gun script is being called a TV pilot script , but if it 's well received it may become the basis of a new Star Trek movie . <p> This would definitely seem to tie in with the recent comments by Paramount chairman Sherry Lansing , who recently said they wanted to ' re-invent Star Trek and do something fresh and original . ' In my opinion , it would also mean the death of Star Trek As We Know It . Find more in the full report , but please do remember that it certainly has n't been confirmed yet - as a matter of fact , Paramount even denies the rumours later on in the story . Thanks go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Personally I would n't believe any of these rumours until officially confirmed - this appears to be just an old rumour re-surfacing , and it does n't seem to fit with the 25th Century rumour TrekWeb recently reported . Of course , if you have a different opinion , please let me know at feedback@treknation.com , and I might even print it in the upcoming letters section : - ) . <p> Voyager To Be Cancelled ? Christian ( 3:43 pm CST ) Before I begin with the actual rumour report , let me add in a huge disclaimer . At first I was n't sure if I was going to post the below rumours , most notably because they only came from one source , and perhaps also because the rumours certainly were n't what I wanted to hear . However , this is actually from a source I trust rather a lot , and I would also have reported on it had it been published on another site . Furthermore , it certainly fits with some of the predictions ratings-watchers have already been making over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still take the below as purely unconfirmed rumours . <p> Lord Spock just sent in the following extremely alarming report : <p> I say this with a heavy heart , but there is reason to believe that Voyager IS going to be CANCELLED at the end of its SIXTH SEASON or earlier . Yesterday , a meeting of the programming department took place , where the list of shows that are in danger of being cancelled was discussed . Voyager was VERY VERY close to being shut down on this day already , but the people in charge first wanted to see if the ratings will improve . <p> The only people who currently know this are about 100+ programming executives , and Rick Berman himself , who was told in private . If the ratings sink any lower than they already are now , and the mid-season ratings turn out horrible , they 'll just cut us off . <p> Again , this has not been confirmed by anyone yet , but if it is true , this certainly does n't come as a surprise - Voyager 's ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the show is rather expensive . Personally I 'd say this might actually be a good thing , if Voyager really is beyond saving - at least , if there will still be a new series after Voyager . Thanks go out to Lord Spock for submitting this , even if most of us probably would n't have wanted to have to hear this ; - ) . <p> German ' Insurrection ' VideoChristian ( 3:32 pm CST ) The German Daily Trekkies newsletter is reporting that the German ' Insurrection ' Video will be released on the 8th of July by CIC . You can currently already pre-order the video here , and if you do that , you 'll get a free poster thrown in . The video will cost DM 39,95 ( about $20 ) . <p> Presently , Louie 's group , Louie Beltran and the West Coast Players are actively performing various venues and concerts throughout the west coast .

A new article at E ! Online contains a few statements from Pocket Books editor John Ordover about the Spock/Saavik wedding : <p> Ordover explains that what humans think of as a wedding , Vulcans think of as a betrothal . Hence , the participants are n't giddy with honeymoon plans because they 're not going to , um , consummate the relationship until they 're both officially mad with pon farr--that crazy Vulcan mating thing . ( See : " Amok Time . " Again . ) <p> ... <p> The editor says the Spock wedding was a dream storyline opened up to the novel 's writers , Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz , by a line from a Next Generation episode in which Picard remarks about attending the wedding of Sarek 's son . The decision to marry off one of the Enterprise 's most eligible bachelors made , " then the question came down to who does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever we picked we were going to be upsetting a lot of the audience , " he says , adding that some simply will be ticked that Spock " is n't marrying them . " <p> The full article has a bit more on the background of the novel . Thanks go out to John Ordover for sending in the link to this . In related news : <p> There 's a new poll up at the Sci-Fi Wire asking fans if the marriage is actually a good idea . <p> You can win a copy of the novel by visiting this page at the Daily Sci-Fi . <p> " Vulcan 's Heart " authors Josepha Sherman and Susan Schwartz will be attending an online chat at TrekWeb somewhere in mid-July . <p> Happy Birthday Jeri Taylor !

While the U.S.S. Voyager tries to rescue them from this risky area of space , the away team befriends Noss , an exotic alien woman who 's also trapped on the planet . Soon , she falls in love with Tuvok and although it 's illogical for a Vulcan , he finds himself attracted to her too . <p> Thanks go out to the Continuum for both the description and the image , which is of course copyrighted by Paramount Pictures . <p> -The Sci-Fi Channel is continuing its tribute to DeForest Kelley , which I personally think is absolutely great of them . Today they 'll be showing " The Empath " at 7:00pm and at 11:00pm Eastern Time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS9 's ' Indiscretion ' tomorrow at 17:00 and at 23:30 BST , according to the Television Observation Unit of the Star Trek Collective . <p> -Tomorrow morning at 01:35 CET , German Sat.1 will be repeating DS9 's ' Chula - Das Spiel ' ( Move Along Home ) . At 15:00 they 'll be showing ' Die Nachfolge ' ( The Nagus ) . BTW , could someone who speaks better German than I do perhaps e-mail Sat.1 to complain to them about their DS9 preview pages ? For some weird reason it 's showing a picture of the U.S.S.

Most notably lacking is some sort of scene that answers the question of Bajor in the political sense . Will Bajor ever join the Federation ? Presumably so , but there 's no mention of such in dialog , which seems like a huge omission considering that was Sisko 's mission in the first place . The closing sense is more one of " life goes on , " with Kira now commanding the station instead of Sisko . That 's fine , but a look at Bajor 's new role in the post-war Federation would 've been nice .

@@58304164 @7304164/ <h> Retro Review : Coda <p> Janeway is caught in a time loop that ends with her death and the arrival of what appears to be her late father . <p> Plot Summary : A sudden storm interrupts Janeway and Chakotays affectionate banter while they 're alone on a shuttlecraft . The shuttle crashes on a planet , nearly killing Janeway , though Chakotay performs CPR and revives her . Minutes later , the two are attacked and slain by Vidiians , but moments after that , they find themselves back on the shuttle , chatting as if nothing has happened . This sequence of events repeats with variations : the shuttle is blown apart , the captain contracts the Vidiian phage and is euthanized by the Doctor , an anomaly appears on the viewscreen always ending in Janeways death . Finally she observes while Chakotay is unable to revive her with CPR as he did the first time . The crew tries to come to terms with her loss , which some deny because at first Kes believes she can sense Janeways consciousness . Janeway tries to find ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through solid matter . The anomaly reappears on the ship , releasing Janeways father , who claims to have arrived to demonstrate that she is dead and to help her cross over . Though distressed when Tuvok and Kes stop using telepathy to search for her and wrenched when Chakotay leads a memorial service at which Torres and Kim become emotional , Janeway does not feel ready to move on . When her father pressures and then bullies her to accept her fate , she concludes that he is not a spirit and she is not dead , but fighting for her life while an alien presence tries to draw her consciousness into the anomaly . With the help of the Doctor , she fights off the alien and wakes on the planet . Chakotay advises her to take it easy for a few days , but Janeway is unnerved by the idea that this alien species could be responsible for myths about the afterlife and prefers to celebrate having cheated death , inviting Chakotay to share a bottle of champagne on a holodeck moonlight sail around Lake George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Coda " makes me so acutely nostalgic that I cant pretend to review it objectively . If you do n't  care about Janeway and Chakotays relationship apart from how they interact as a command team , you 'll probably find the episode derivative and somewhat over-the-top , which is fair . The script borrows from several previous Star Trek installments , the guest star is too menacing to take seriously as a benevolent force , and can anyone imagine Riker sobbing over Picards body , let alone Spock sobbing over Kirks ? Feel free to discuss in comments how the afterlife in " Coda " is n't nearly as compelling as the one in " Emanations " and how much more fun it would be to meet Q from " Tapestry " upon your presumed death rather than to meet Janeways father . Also feel free to discuss how " Cause and Effect " did the time loop story better , how " The Tholian Web " did the ghost captain better , how The Wrath of Khan did the memorial service better , and whether its logical that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of performing euthanasia on an unwilling patient without requiring a second opinion , in which case the first thing Janeway does upon recovery should be to disable that option , since the sickbay gas chamber should be the first obvious giveaway that she is n't in a time loop but being manipulated by an alien . These are all valid concerns about the story , but they are n't  what I want to discuss . All I 've ever remembered about " Coda " is the phenomenal chemistry between Janeway and Chakotaythe way they make each other laugh , the way they casually use first names and touch when no one else is looking , the way they flirt . The way they adore each other . If you disagree , then come up with one other valid reason for them to go on potentially dangerous away missions together just so they can have some alone time . <p> " Coda " is a direct sequel to " Resolutions " as well as " Futures End " and " The Q and the Grey " all episodes in which we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement and challenge one another in addition to keeping each other comfortable and relaxed . These little things are of crucial importance in the jobs theyll likely have to keep for many years without any hope of sabbaticals or even significant down time . As enjoyable as it is to watch them falling in love in a desert island scenario in " Resolutions , " I find " Coda " preferable because this is real life for them , working in jobs they chose and for which they trained . Its not like there 's no one else on board with whom Janeway can share a chuckle about Talent Night , since we see her doing just that with Neelix before she gets on the shuttle with Chakotay . Its the way she brushes off Neelixs compliment about her dubious ballet skills , even though that dialogue is written to sound teasing and naughty ( " Captain , you were especially good last night . " " Thanks , Neelix . Its been a while . " ) , whereas when Chakotay announces that the highlight of his evening was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she insists that she dances like a six-year-old . The two seamlessly segue from Janeways suggestion that they could perform together at the next Talent Night to working in tandem to avert a crisis . No one watching this episode is really worried about whether the two will survive , considering that they 're series regulars we even know better than to worry about the destruction of the shuttlecraft , since Voyager apparently has several thousand . All the power of the opening scenes comes from the dynamic between Janeway and Chakotay , the way she responds when he cant remember the time loop , the way he reacts when he believes he s lost her . As in " Dreadnought , " he let 's her go when he must , but oh , it hurts . <p> Because its stranded in the Delta Quadrant , Voyager is in a tough situation and yes , I mean the show , not just the ship . With the other series , there are a lot of big issues to engage the passions of the characters . There 's a Federation to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes come up against the moral codes of individuals , there are alien adversaries who live nearby and must be dealt with as permanent threats , plus there are families and friends close enough for occasional or even regular visits whether its Trois meddling mother or Siskos Earth-bound father . On Voyager , even still-living relatives might as well be ghosts they only show up in memories , holograms , alien hallucinations and there are no species like the Klingons or the Dominion who must be dealt with as permanent fixtures . Starfleet principles like the non-interference directive must be addressed and interpreted without the support and oversight of admirals and diplomats . Apart from a Kazon arc here and a Borg sequence there , nearly all the connections on this show must be among the regular characters , many of whom , like Carey and Ayala , never become much more than repeated faces in specific jobs . Given these storytelling constraints , the most interesting relationships are also the most complicated . There 's none with greater potential than the captain and first officer , a dynamic that inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and commitment into the mix , and we 'd finally get a relationship to rival all the beautiful , complex bonds on Deep Space Nine between people in situations just as complicated a Starfleet captain and a Maquis rebel , a solid Bajoran and a shapeshifting Founder , a Trill who 's an honorary Klingon and a Klingon who was raised by humans . <p> It never happens , of course . In a couple of weeks we get the first installment in what will become Chakotays long history of falling for aggressive Borg women , and we get even more indications that Janeways not capable of sharing her responsibilities since she becomes overly emotional and locks herself away when challenged . This is n't either characters fault its the writing and its not the fault of Kate Mulgrew or Robert Beltran , who are clearly giving their all in " Coda " both in what look like effortless lighthearted moments and in the dark emotional scenes . Beltrans the one who gets to cry , a powerful contrast to the glorified " emotionless " men of the Star Trek franchise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to portray as Janeway slowly realizes that she 's being manipulated by an alien who can access her private memories . Presumably the alien shows Janeway people mourning her the way shed wish to be remembered , so the lovely speech Torres gives at her memorial service about what she learned from the captain represents Janeways attachment to Torres as much as the reverse . Which means that were not necessarily seeing how Chakotay would act upon Janeways death , but how she hopes he would act . In some ways " Coda " seems like a remix of " Persistence of Vision , " also written by Jeri Taylor , since this time Janeway refuses to succumb to an evil alien impersonating a loved one . She fights to keep her ship and does n't  spare a single thought for the man on Earth shell presumably never see again . Janeway may never fully believe in the evil alien impersonating her father , a beloved figure miraculously returned to life , but I know how she feels , because except for a brief interlude in the final season flashback episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Janeway and Chakotay , and its hard to let go .

So did my nine-year-old , who is thrilled that Enterprise now makes pee jokes every other episode . Between his bathroom humor and my slashing every character in sight ... no , wait , the producers did that . We just could n't help but notice . <p> This week , Kevin Sorbo created a lot of controversy among Andromeda fans by announcing that he wants the show to be more like a Mel Brooks movie . Several prominent reviewers ( and an awful lot of fans ) publicly declared that they were giving up on Andromeda this season , as a result of comments and attitudes like these . I note this here because in spite of it all , I love Andromeda , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be so when I am so critical of Enterprise . Well , guess what ? Enterprise IS Andromeda !

He 's furious that he was n't warned , when he brought his dog down to Kreetassen for some fresh air , that the dog could pick up alien microbes . Perhaps the Kreetassen do n't have any pets who eat plants , or perhaps , as on Phlox 's planet , they eat their equivalent of dogs .

" Which is terribly cruel , but my most common alternative thought about him is , " I wonder who is more Reed 's type -- Archer or Tucker ? " and I know how it infuriates people when I imply that about him . Reed was barely in this episode except as a body in the dream sequence -- like Mayweather , who goes from being a corpse to being a stiff -- so I should leave the poor man alone . <p> In fact , I should stick to the two characters who were n't assassinated : Sato and Phlox .

But Phlox does n't . Phlox is his doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scanty evidence at hand , I think one could make just as good a case for Archer 's tension and frustration stemming from the fact that he ca n't have Tucker as from the fact that he ca n't have T'Pol . No , he does n't bite Tucker 's head off for telling him to take the high road the same way he bites T'Pol later for complaining that he 's overly committed to his dog , but maybe that 's just transference or something . Maybe all his tension comes from being out with Reed , and having Reed 's head in his lap just a few short weeks ago . That 's not a particularly more outrageous guess than the suggestion that Cupid 's stress must be caused by Our Lady of the Icy Exterior . <p> It 's not out of character for Phlox to be voyeuristic and obsessed with the crew 's sex lives -- in " Fight or Flight " he was already speculating on who was going to shag whom on the crew before they were a month gone from Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I guess we 're supposed to find him a kindly old doctor figure with lots of experience both personal and scientific , but he frequently gives me the creeps , and you could n't pay me to get naked around him even with a phaser burn .

Or would it be too dangerous if it were Archer , Tucker and Reed slathering each other 's mostly-naked bodies with lube ... I mean goo ... I mean ... there 's no good way out of this , is there ? <p> Visually , this is a superb episode . We get Archer sweaty and T'Pol sweaty . We get Archer 's naked chest , T'Pol 's naked back , Sato in a tank top , close-ups of both Archer 's and T'Pol 's tightly-clad backsides . We get a beagle model that unfortunately does n't breathe or shift position for most of the episode , making my son worry that the dog might be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog in formaldehyde . Some of the camera angles are truly inspired -- the orange crush spilling in sickbay , the pan to Phlox in preacher clothes at the funeral -- in general the dream sequence , though utterly gratuitous , was superbly done , though I have never seen myself making out from an out of body perspective in a dream . It would have been more interesting to see the beginning of the decon scene again , this time from Archer 's perspective , the way we saw T'Pol 's naked back from his perspective just before the kissy-face started . <p> After humiliating himself in the necessary apology ritual , Archer thanks Phlox for making him more culturally sensitive , then braces himself and and apologizes to T'Pol . When he hesitantly brings up the fact that his tension may be exacerbated by the fact that she 's a woman , she runs off at the mouth for an incredibly long time about what a good thing it is that they 're not in any position to get down and boogie because if they were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense they would be trying not to think about getting down and boogie-ing . She 's slightly more dignified about it than this paraphrase , but on a Vulcan scale , it 's somewhere on par with Spock in " Amok Time " yelling , " JIM ! ! ! " <p> But this is n't original Trek . I know that because Kirk would not have put on braids and done performance art for any mission ; he 'd have had Scotty build a plasma injector out of a damp spacesuit and convinced the aliens to give up their silly restrictive customs . On the other hand , if Kirk had had a first officer who flirted with him as shamelessly as T'Pol flirts with Archer , he would n't have gotten into trouble on so many away missions because he never would have left the briefing room . Then again , Janeway had a first officer who flirted with her as shamelessly as T'Pol flirts with Archer , yet she remained celibate for practically a decade after declaring pretty much the opposite of what Archer told Reed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a long way from home . <p> I must say , Archer 's attitude is much more appealing and considerably more logical than Janeway 's . But I doubt he 'll go for it with T'Pol . For starters , I thought after " Breaking the Ice " that Tucker was her man . If she and Archer got together , I 'm sure Tucker would be devastated . Not to mention Reed ... and I do n't mean because he once said he likes her bum . Ah , Enterprise , epicenter of so much sexual tension . Phlox must be in heaven .

OBrien and Odo conclude that the blast was a deliberate attack and suspect that a visiting Flaxian assassin was hired to kill Garak . Though the Flaxian claims innocence , Odo finds Garak even less forthcoming about why anyone would want to kill him . The shapeshifter releases the Flaxian so he can have him followed , only to find Garak waiting in his runabout . The two tail the Flaxian ship but it explodes just before going to warp speed . When the crew determines that a Romulan trigger set off the explosion , Odo concludes that the Romulans were likely behind the attack on Garak . A secret informant corroborates this information and tells him that five former Obsidian Order operatives all died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the dead operatives , Garak insists that they were friends , not former colleagues , which makes an enraged Odo accuse Garak of blowing up his own shop just to get Odo involved in learning who has been killing off onetime Obsidian Order elite . Garak explains that he and the dead Cardassians were all disciples of Order leader Enabran Tain , who has disappeared as well . Odo accompanies Garak to find Tains safe house , but before they can get there , a Romulan warbird captures them . They are greeted by Tain , who admits that he was behind the attempt to kill Garak but now he thinks Garak could be an asset in his current scheme : he has forged an alliance between the Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar , hoping that the Cardassian and Romulan intelligence agencies can do what their governments have been too cowardly to do and neutralize the Dominion by wiping out the Founders . After his fleet of warships accomplishes this goal , Tain intends to take over the Order again , which is why he targeted all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to work together again . <p> Tain and Colonel Lovok of the Tal Shiar command a fleet of cloaked Romulan ships headed for the Gamma Quadrant . Their particle emissions alert Deep Space Nine to their presence , and though Sisko is ordered by Admiral Toddman to remain in the Alpha Quadrant and prepare for retaliatory JemHadar attacks , he tells his senior staff that he intends to take the Defiant to search for Odo . Tain tests Garaks resolve by asking that he interrogate Odo , saying that if Garak resists , hell leave Odo to the Romulans , even though Garak is certain that Odo has no information about the Founders that Starfleet has n't  already shared . While Garak uses a prototype device to prevent Odo from shapeshifting , leaving Odo in agony when it is time for him to regenerate , Sisko follows the fleet through the wormhole , only to learn that Eddington has sabotaged the cloaking device under orders from Toddman to stop Sisko from interfering in the Gamma Quadrant . Anguished by the agony he is causing Odo , Garak begs him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confesses that he wants to go home to the Great Link to rejoin his people , Garak realizes that Odo truly has no useful strategic secrets and let 's him regenerate . Tain orders Odos execution , but Lovok insists that the Romulans have the right to study the shapeshifter first . The fleet reaches the Founders planet in the Omarion Nebula and begins to destroy its core , but the surface life signs do n't  change , and Garak realizes that they are looking at false sensor readings the planet is deserted . The Founders trap closes as hundreds of JemHadar ships surround the fleet . Garak rescues Odo with the help of Lovok , who reveals that he , too , is a shapeshifter who learned of Tains plan and supported it so that the Founders could eradicate the Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar . Refusing once again to join the Founders , Odo flees with Garak in the runabout , which is rescued by the Defiant during the JemHadar attack that obliterates Tains fleet . Starfleet elects not to punish Siskos crew and Garak elects to keep Odos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garak episode since " The Wire , " and " Improbable Cause " is clever enough to bring back Enabran Tain , Garaks not-yet-acknowledged father and , as Odo surmises , worst enemy . Andrew Robinson is one of those actors who has chemistry with every single person with whom he shares the screen like John de Lancie , he raises everybodys game and because Garak is in a combative relationship with pretty much all the characters , even his ostensible friend Bashir , his presence brings energy and excitement to all his episodes . I love that this two-parter kicks off with a domestic scene between Garak and Bashir , quarreling over whether the latter has been so busy that he s been blowing off meals with Garak ; Bashir gets there late , but Garak has to stall to keep him there anyway so that everyone knows where he s been spotted right before his shop blows up . Meanwhile , they 're arguing about whether Julius Caesar is more of a boring farce than a tragedy , since its obvious to Garak from the beginning that Brutus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor and the action remain at the same high level throughout " Improbable Cause , " as Garak fumbles to enlist Odos help in figuring out who 's trying to kill him and while Bashir tries to keep things friendly , telling Garak the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf ( which Garak thinks is a warning not about telling too many lies , but about telling the same lie twice ) , Odo has no reason to be amiable and gets to unleash the sort of anger he usually reserves for violent criminals or meddling Ferengi . There 's really not a dull moment , and that 's even before we know the storys actually about a planned invasion of the Gamma Quadrant by the Cardassian and Romulan intelligence agencies . <p> The second half of the two-parter is n't as strong as the first , partly because " The Die Is Cast " tries to pack so much into a single installment a brief onscreen battle , and were supposed to believe that the entire combined Cardassian-Romulan fleet has been wiped out ? and partly because the regular characters are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but orders Kira to pretend that a message from Starfleet is garbled , but Siskos really not very impressive . He s already been quite liberal about loaning runabouts to whoever is asking , without demanding to know things like how Odo knows his secret source can be trusted and what debt that guy owes Odo anyway . But the always troublesome wild card Eddington sabotages the Defiant right under Siskos nose , and instead of giving him the lecture about loyalty and incarceration that Eddington so richly deserves , Sisko decides to trust him and puts him right back at his post ! Kira is hardly in these episodes except as a joke when Odo asks Garak who would want to kill him sure , we think of her when Garak asks Odo whether he really cares about anyone and again when Garak demands to know Odos deepest secrets , but neither she nor by extension the Bajorans are given much of a role in the story in which the Cardassians may bring a Dominion attack force to Bajors doorstep . Dax and OBrien do their jobs efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bashir considers OBrien a poor substitute for Garak as a lunch date and OBrien ca n't tell when a guy from security has been meddling with the precious cloaking device . On the other hand , " The Die Is Cast " is more interesting visually than " Improbable Cause , " which almost seems like a low-budget episode the post-bomb shop does n't  have enough wreckage ( which I guess makes sense once we realize Garak himself blew it up ) , the room in which Odo questions the Flaxian does n't  seem like a security cell , the Romulan ship pops out rather cheesily . In the sequel episode , the visuals of Odos disintegration under torture a visual precursor to the Founders disease which will be so important in later seasons are superb all by themselves . <p> When I first saw these episodes , I was troubled by various inconsistencies the fact that the Romulans , who at first personally guarded the Defiants cloaking device , had no plan for tracking the ship or disabling the device if it was used against them , the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegade mission to rescue Odo that could have gotten them all court-martialed and left the station defenseless during a potential JemHadar attack , the fact that Sisko stuck his neck so far out for Odo in the first place when at the start of the season he refused to do just that and debated with Kira about precisely how important Odos role was . Eddington reappears just long enough to betray everyone ( and stand up for Starfleet , which he will dramatically betray later ) . And why do the Cardassians need a stasis field to pick off individual Founders if they intend to wipe all of them out in a single attack did they use the Bajoran studies of Odo to construct it ? Odo , at least , is in terrific form , reminding me of how much his character has developed since " Necessary Evil " he can play the good cop without forgetting that he has allied himself with darkness , and his deepest secrets are entirely of an intimate nature , apolitical and outside justice . I thought when these episodes first aired that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slating his own son to die along with all the others who know too much about him ( and putting the loyal Mila on the same list , though that might just have been to test Garak ) seems cruel even by the standards of , say , Dukat , whose rise to power becomes much easier to explain with so much of the Obsidian Order wiped out . The Cardassian and Romulan governments come off looking pretty pathetic , as does a timid , unprepared Starfleet Command . One admiral gets to make the call that the station , Bajor , and the wormhole should be left to the mercy of the Dominion ? At least Sisko can think for himself , even if he goes running off unnecessarily on a mission probably best deputized to Kira and Dax so he can prepare the defense forces back home . <p> Odos confession that he wants to go home is the emotional high point of these episodes , even more than Garaks realization that he truly can never go home again . For both these men , " home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike the fact that it took a torture sequence for Odo to realize how much he and Garak have in common , it feels a bit too much like Stockholm Syndrome , but the characters and actors play so beautifully off each other that I still want to see them have those lunches where Odo wont eat and Garak will suggest that he s hacked the station security files , which would be an entertaining counterpoint to Garaks books-and-food-porn breakfasts with Bashir ( eat my isolinear rod if I do n't  come back , hahaha ) . Tains motto may be " Always burn your bridges behind you , " but its clearly not Garaks . He s obviously not happy about having to torture Odo even before it starts , while Odo is mocking him , " Oh nooo , you 're going to torture me , pleeeease have mercy . " He clearly despises himself during the interrogation , even pleading with Odo to lie to make it stop . The Romulan colonel who 's really a shapeshifter makes no sense to me here ; if hed demanded to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice the refrain that no changeling has ever harmed another , but he let 's Garak do it , then demands to know why Garak was protecting Odo through the torture and afterward . Has Garak made a friend among the Founders ? Is this why the Founders will later decide that perhaps the Cardassians can be trusted as allies , despite how they treat their own ?

Norris &amp; Laura A. Van Vleet 's behind the scenes Voyager set tour . This time , the focus of their interview is Voyager 's moral officer and cook , Neelix , played by Ethan Phillips . Over recent years , Phillip 's character has played an apparently ever-declining role within the series . Describing his character as " more of a pitch hitter for the series " , he explains that " his function was more like spice to the main course . A cooking metaphor , I know , he added a little flavour when you needed it but he was n't part of the main bulk of the stew . " <p> " I think over the last few years , the writers got real caught up in the Doctor 's character and in Jeri 's , " he continues . " The general perception is that they are the most popular characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write for those kinds of characters , those individuals who are so ' Sci-Fi ' by their very nature - a hologram , and somebody who 's been compromised by the Borg . They really bring ideas to a writer 's head , and also , they just like writing for them . I think it 's been a matter of who the writers like writing for , and also , the kinds of stories they buy . That 's just the way the cards played out . " <p> On the other hand , as time progressed , he became thankful for every bit of time he could avoid spending in makeup . " And I have to tell you , the last couple of years , the makeup became so horrendously difficult to wear for me that I was glad to not be featured so heavily in the storylines . It became real torture to wear that stuff for seventeen hours a day . I could n't take it . You ca n't sleep after you 've been in makeup that long , and you ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which takes three hours to put on ? " Imagine having a rubber ski mask glued to your head for seventeen hours , with contact lenses and teeth , " Phillips says . " It 's extraordinarily hot . I remember saying to Rick Berman the first year I put it on , ' this is not so bad ' . Berman said , ' talk to me in four years ' , and he was right , because once you start sweating under that mask , it feels like ants crawling around your head . The removal process , which takes an hour and a half , is just a bath of oil and rubbing alcohol , and it stings . Oh , it 's just disgusting . " <p> " I 'm close with all of them , " Phillips replies when asked about his friends among the cast . " We have great friendships going here . I get along with everybody .

" Well , the official word , " he says , " is that the writers felt they had come to an ending as to where they thought they could explore her character . They wanted to bring on somebody new so they could kind of stimulate themselves and use their imaginations . " However , her personally believes there was a little more to it than that . <p> " I think it is probably true that they really did want this new character , and they thought about this Borg having her journey from being part of the collective consciousness all the way down to an individual . There were budget restraints that would n't support having ten regulars on the show , and in the final analysis they felt they 'd explored Kes enough . That 's my take on it . I 'm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing pretty well . She 's done some movies and she 's back in school now . " <p> Potentially adding the speculation that Phillip 's character is leaving the show in the second-last regular episode shot , ' Destiny ' is his announcement that he 's scheduled to start work on his next project the day after the show wraps . " I 'm going to do a play right after this , over at the Pasadena Playhouse , " Phillips revealed . " It 's called ' Side Man ' . It picked up the Tony Award , and of interest to Star Trek fans , Andy Robinson ( ' Garak ' , Deep Space 9 ) is directing it . We wrap Voyager on the 9th , and I start rehearsals for the play on April 10th . No grass is growing under my feet !

@@58304176 @7304176/ <h> Imperfection <p> By Edward James HinesPosted at October 19 , 2000 - 4:56 PM GMT <p> " Imperfection " *** Teleplay by Carleton Eastlake and Robert Doherty Story by Andre Bormanis Directed by David Livingston <p> Captain 's Log <p> It is a " bittersweet " day aboard Voyager as a Wysanti vessel arrives to claim former Borg children Azan ( Kurt Wetherill ) and Rebi ( Cody Wetherill ) . Mezoti ( Marley S. McClean ) , while not a member of their species , joins them . Icheb ( Manu Intiraymi ) remains on the ship . <p> After the children 's departure , Icheb notices Seven of Nine tearing from her ocular implant . She dismisses this as a technical malfunction , but privately she has been suffering from headaches and other bodily discomforts . When she learns that she can no longer regenerate in her alcove because of an incompatible interface , she tries to work through the night in the Mess Hall , but collapses when Neelix arrives in the morning . <p> It turns out that Seven 's primary cortical node is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implants because the cortical node can no longer regulate them . Tragically , Seven will soon die because these particular implants control her vital bodily functions . Unfortunately , neither replicating nor fixing the existing cortical node are viable options because of the complexity of Borg technology . <p> Janeway resolves to find another cortical node . She , Tuvok and Tom Paris take the new Delta Flyer back to a Borg debris field that Voyager passed several days earlier . After encountering some resistance from alien pirates , who claimed the debris for themselves , the Away Team returns to Voyager with the cortical node from a dead Borg drone . Unfortunately , after several failed holodeck simulations of the replacement procedure , the Doctor concludes that Seven 's body would reject a cortical node that has been inactive for too long . <p> Seven takes the news hard but attempts to continue performing her duties . When Icheb requests her help in preparing for the astrometrics portion of the Starfleet Academy entrance exam , which he has decided to take , Seven insists that he seek help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stung by her rejection and sensing that she has given up hope , Icheb resolves to find a way to save her . <p> After extensive research , Icheb determines that his own cortical node could be removed and given to Seven . Since his body is younger , having been removed prematurely from a Borg maturation chamber and never fully assimilated , it stands a good chance of adapting without the cortical node . Seven refuses to go along with this plan if there is the slightest chance that Icheb will come to harm . He soon takes matters into his own hands and deactivates his own cortical node . <p> Icheb is rushed to Sickbay but manages to convince Seven that she , too , must learn to rely on others and accept help from those who care for her . The surgery is successful for both patients , and after each has taken sufficient time to recover , Seven promises to help Icheb study for his Academy entrance exam . <p> Supplemental <p> Whether by accident or design , " Imperfection " is the fourth-consecutive No. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This informal quadrilogy which includes S4 's " The Gift , " S5 's " Drone " and S6 's " Survival Instinct " comprises story lines that depict Seven in some kind of emotional crisis . In " The Gift , " it is the shock of being separated from the Borg Collective . In " Drone , " she is overcome with grief at the death of the futuristic Borg drone named One . In " Survival Instinct , " Seven feels remorse for having condemned three former drones to death because of actions she took several years earlier . <p> " Imperfection " depicts Seven confronting her own mortality and the regret she feels not only for herself , but also for Janeway . It seems strange particularly after her jolted emotional awareness in " Unimatrix Zero " to see Seven still denying her emotions in the real world , even after three years as an individual . Nevertheless , " Imperfection " is a touching episode that capitalizes on the vibrant emotional interplay not only between Janeway and Seven , but also between Seven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that infuses Icheb with vibrancy too powerful to ignore . Thankfully , he survives not only the " general housecleaning " that saw the abrupt exit of his fellow Borg youngsters , but also what could have been the expected , hackneyed denouement resulting in his death . <p> Existence Is Futile <p> The hasty disposition of the Borg children is the most troubling element of the show . Their summary dismissal makes the teaser most akin to the " imperfection " bespoken by the episode 's title . Who saw this coming ? <p> If you think about it , however , the story works better if there is only one ex-drone aboard Voyager who can offer Seven his cortical node . Also , the departure serves to stifle the doubtlessly annoying question of why the Borg children , when they are not involved in an episode , are conveniently missing from the cargo bay when Seven comes home to regenerate ( as in " Unimatrix Zero " ) . Still , there is no denying that the " Imperfection " opening sequence seems rushed to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the story as quickly as possible . " <p> Surprisingly , and unforgivably , neither Neelix nor Naomi Wildman are present in the Transporter Room to say goodbye to their friends . Neelix , in particular , would never absent himself from such an important event , especially given all the time he has spent with Naomi , these Borg children ( " Ashes to Ashes , " " The Haunting of Deck Twelve " ) and other alien children ( " Counterpoint " ) . Actor Ethan Phillips has little enough to do as it is without the producers missing an obvious opportunity to include Neelix in such a crucial farewell . <p> Also terribly strange is that the Wetherill twins are given no dialogue for their final scene as Azan and Rebi . Granted , they were never given much to say anyway , but this is a special occasion . How about a simple " thanks " and " we 'll miss you " ? <p> And what headquarters genius decided it was time to get rid of Mezoti ? It is at least understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely used , but actor Marley S. McClean always brought such a wonderful precociousness to Mezoti that it is difficult to understand why the producers would want to give her up . The Wysanti were n't even her people . Her departure seems more like an afterthought , i.e. , " While you 're at it , Madame Wysanti , could you please take this little girl , too ? " This seems especially unfair to Naomi , who is once again bereft of a playmate . <p> This general confusion seems to be part of the inexplicable " master plan " behind VGR to avoid developing an " extended family " of recurring characters . Of the three contemporary Star Trek series , this concept should work best on VGR because it features a small , enclosed environment of about 150 people who are stuck together . Ironically , however , the idea flourished on DS9 , which , as a space station , should have seen different aliens always coming and going . Regardless , DS9 's main characters were often revealed more clearly via their interactions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a result , after almost seven seasons , we know surprisingly little about most of these people . <p> Despite the questionable circumstances around which the Borg children are sent packing , the scene at least plays well . Actor Jeri Ryan usually betrays such little emotion as Seven that when she does allow the character to be moved , even slightly , the expression is unmistakably apparent . The hugs that Seven exchanges with Mezoti , Azan and Rebi seem to affect her so much that in the very next scene , she is anxious to deactivate their regeneration alcoves under the guise of conserving energy . But we know better . <p> Three Generations of Janeways <p> At this point in the series , Janeway and Seven 's teacher/student , mother/daughter relationship has been well-documented . In " Imperfection , " however , Seven shows continuing signs of maturity by assuming responsibility for her own health , insisting that the Doctor adhere to physician/patient confidentiality without informing Janeway of Seven 's earlier , minor medical troubles . <p> Later , when the situation worsens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doctor and tries to calm an agitated Seven . Janeway as " mom " also demonstrates the extraordinary lengths to which she will go to help Seven . As in " Dark Frontier , " Janeway proposes to infiltrate a Borg ship and , this time , take a cortical node from a living drone , if necessary . The Doctor , of course , objects to this unethical option and catches Janeway off-guard with his vehemence a nicely performed scene . <p> But there is a new extension to the Janeway family tree Icheb , who similarly shares a son/mother , student/teacher relationship with Seven ( begun in " Child 's Play " ) . With her back turned to him in the Astrometrics Lab , we can see Seven 's almost-imperceptible beam of pride as Icheb expresses interest in greater challenges , wanting to work on the Bridge and even take the Starfleet Academy entrance exam . Later , in her naivete , Seven hopes to spare Icheb the pain of her death by pushing him off onto other crewmembers ( and out of the nest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also learn to rely on others recalls Worf 's early problem of having to depend on people , especially with his life ( TNG 's " Coming of Age " ) . <p> Icheb 's budding relationship with Janeway is expectedly tentative at this stage with just the suggestion of a grandson-to-grandmother slant especially when Seven rejects Icheb 's plan and he appeals to Janeway to overturn Seven 's rejection . After all , what is a boy to do when mom wo n't listen ? Hit up grandma , of course ! <p> Reconciling Imperfection <p> The most enlightening scene between VGR 's celebrated mother/daughter combo involves Seven 's concern that , in death , she will have failed to live up to Janeway 's expectations of her as an individual . Obviously , this assumption is erroneous to Janeway , who instead marvels at Seven 's development over the last three years . Seven , however , still seems to be thinking as a Borg drone in pursuit of " perfection , " and that her failure to successfully " assimilate " the role of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , but also make her time among the Voyager crew irrelevant and unmemorable . This , to a Borg drone , is unimaginable , because even if the drone were to be deactivated , its memories would continue to reside in the Collective 's consciousness . Seven , now disconnected from the hive , worries that her contributions as an individual will be lost and forgotten if she dies . This is why she feels a greater impetus to succeed and be useful , running herself ragged day-after-day in pursuit of a " perfection " she does n't realize she will never achieve . It simply is n't the nature of humans to lead " perfect " lives . In the 24th century , humans pursue the betterment not the perfection of themselves and their communities . <p> Surprisingly , the perfect example of the " typical human " is Neelix who is obviously not human but he shares an important characteristic with Seven . He , too , runs himself ragged around Voyager , wearing many different hats and making a grand life for himself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him is that he can kick back , relax and enjoy some time off . When he and Seven are playing the game in Sickbay and she asks him if he has something better to do , his answer is the pat " Nothing that ca n't wait . " This is an important lesson for Seven to learn . Some things take precedence over the successful performance of duties . <p> Strange Bedfellows <p> The astonishing " heart-to-heart " conversation about death that Seven shares with B'Elanna Torres should probably have been assigned to Neelix , who has actually died ( " Mortal Coil " ) and grappled with the faith-shattering experience of finding " nothing " in his afterlife . Torres , despite her epiphanic experience in " Barge of the Dead , " has butted heads with Seven too often in the past , rendering this heartfelt " girl chat " too unbelievable to take seriously . Still , Torres has been known to have " windows " of calm in her usually fiery personality , so maybe Seven just got lucky this day . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torres . Who knows ? The advice and encouragement that Torres imparts to Seven are right on the money . Chalk it up to seventh season sentiment . <p> Details , Details <p> Perhaps the most interesting detail in " Imperfection " is that the crew has already built a new Delta Flyer , so obviously some time has passed between the end of " Unimatrix Zero " and now . Thankfully , the producers included Paris ' playful quip that Janeway should probably be supervised while taking the super-shuttle out on a mission . But for this brief exchange , however , the issue of the once-destroyed Delta Flyer would have been left glaringly dangling . <p> In this same scene , Chakotay acts like a broken record by once again insisting that Janeway not undertake a dangerous mission by herself . <p> The most glaring costuming gaffe in " Imperfection " involves Paris wearing a wedding band during Seven 's simulated and actual surgical procedures . Was " Imperfection " supposed to be shown after the next episode , " Drive , " with coming attractions featuring Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the episode production numbers . " Imperfection " is 248 and " Drive " is 249 . <p> Icheb recalls that Tuvok was once an instructor at Starfleet Academy ( " Flashback " ) . Also , in his proposal to the Doctor , Icheb suggests that without his cortical node , genetic re-sequencing should help his body regulate the remaining Borg implants . In TNG 's " Bloodlines , " Ferengi DaiMon Bok re-sequenced Jason Vigo 's DNA to convince Picard that Jason was his son . <p> The Doctor continues to be a hologram with extraordinary abilities . Not only can he create an amusing play on words ( " Persistence is futile " ) , but also , thanks to Torres having tweaked his program , he can sob when attending the holographic opera . Last season 's " Blink of an Eye " also revealed that the Doctor can sire a child , but no one has figured out that one yet . <p> Regarding the Doctor 's handiwork , Seven 's ocular implant is capable of tearing but then again , so were Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven 's recollection of some of Voyager 's dearly departed include Ensign Marie Kaplan , who died in " Unity , " and Ensign Lyndsay Ballard ( " Ashes to Ashes " ) , who , technically speaking , really is n't dead . The deceased crewman Timothy Lang is different from the female Ensign Lang from " Blood Fever " and " Displaced . " <p> Janeway 's hometown in Indiana is finally revealed as Bloomington , which is also home to Indiana University . <p> Finally , the greatest overlooked detail of all is still about what happened to the Borg baby from " Collective . " Nobody can find it . Does VGR know where the rest of its Borg children are ? ( Last-minute update : Brannon Braga now tells us that the Borg baby was returned to its people off-screen a predictably cheap workaround . ) <p> Behind the Scenes <p> For the first and last time , Marley McClean uses her middle initial " S.

@@58304177 @7304177/ <h> The Cloud Minders <p> Plot Summary : The Enterprise arrives at the planet Ardana to pick up a shipment of zenite necessary to halt a deadly plague on another Federation world , but the zenite has been taken and hidden by the Troglytes - the working-class citizens of Ardana , who work in the mines , kitchens and repair stations while the upper-class leaders and intellectuals live in Stratos , a city in the clouds where life is entirely devoted to leisure . Plasus , the planetary leader , tells Kirk that the Troglytes are mentally inferior and tortures Vanna , a female leader of the rebels who was at one time a servant of himself and his daughter Droxine . But when Vanna attacks Kirk , he realizes that she is intelligent and committed to fighting for the rights of the Troglytes . He also learns from McCoy that the zenite being mined on the planet 's surface emits an odorless gas that is affecting the intelligence and temperament of the miners . When Kirk offers Vanna masks in exchange for the zenite , she takes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has Plasus beamed into the mine . When the gas begins to affect them all , both Vanna and Plasus are forced to realize that the differences between Troglytes and Stratos dwellers have been caused by the gas and major changes are necessary to repair their world . Kirk obtains the shipment of zenite and goes to cure the plague . <p> Analysis : If you 're only going to watch one third-season Star Trek episode about the complications arising when the Enterprise must retrieve medicine to halt a plague , make it " Requiem for Methuselah " rather than this one . " The Cloud Minders " is n't as terrible as I had remembered from youth , for I recall hating it with the fiery heat of Vulcan 's sun . During this re-viewing , it surprised me early on to find myself watching and finding the episode both relevant and interesting . And then Droxine arrived . <p> To be fair , Droxine herself is not really the problem . Yes , she 's a thoughtless bimbo in an outrageously skimpy outfit with an annoying voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means the most embarrassing portrayal of a futuristic woman on Star Trek . What 's intolerable is that there is a character named " Spock " who interacts with her and says the most painfully idiotic things ! He looks like the first officer of the Enterprise , and he appears to be played by Leonard Nimoy , but we get no explanation why he appears to be mentally diminished without even breathing the fumes from mining zenite . He goes ga-ga the moment he sees Droxine - his very first words to her are to call her a work of art , echoing her father 's little joke , except Spock seems to believe it . He babbles to himself , thinking aloud that " the high advisor 's charming daughter Droxine " is " incomparably beautiful and pleasant " like the rest of Stratos and wondering " if the lovely Droxine " could " retain such purity and sweetness of mind " if she knew of the suffering on the planet 's surface . <p> And if that was n't bad enough , this Vulcan who only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circumstances , swearing the captain to secrecy , telling him that it is a thing no offworlder may know and Vulcans do not even speak of it among themselves - Spock did n't even tell his doctor and good friend McCoy but left the chief medical officer to figure it out on his own ! - this very same Vulcan sits and chats blithely with Droxine about it as a form of flirtation . " The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcans , " he informs her pleasantly . " At that time , the mating drive outweighs all other motivations . " When pouting Droxine then asks whether nothing can disturb that cycle , Spock announces , " Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing , madam . " It 's important to note that Spock is n't chatting Droxine up in the hope of learning something useful about the Troglytes , her father or the zenite shipment , the way he opened up to the far more intelligent , sensitive and like-minded Romulan Commander while he was trying to distract her from Kirk 's planned theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPOCK ! - thinking with the wrong head . <p> And boy , does it diminish the episode . It makes Spock seem slow and stupid in other areas , such as his confusion about why the protestors would destroy artwork to make a statement about life on Stratos versus life on the surface . It makes an unfortunate contrast with Kirk 's far more intelligent attempts to get through to Vanna , with whom the captain has far more chemistry than Spock displays with the work of art , since Kirk for once attempts to use both charm and logic at the same time . ( Spock , bursting in on Vanna 's unsuccessful abduction attempt at a point when Kirk is trying to find out why the Troglytes resent the Enterprise , asks whether he 's interrupting anything ! ) Droxine , who seems reasonable if stupid at first , shows her true nature and tells Vanna that Troglyte eyes are not accustomed to light just as Troglyte minds are not accustomed to logic , and Spock just stands there listening while Kirk goes on a crusade for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of ways . Oh , Spock tries halfheartedly to convince Droxine that Troglytes can understand justice while Kirk is passionately objecting to Vanna 's torture by the supposedly nonviolent Stratos dwellers , but he mostly sounds like a besotted egghead . It 's no accident that Kirk is the one Plasus wants shot on sight if he returns . <p> I wo n't even get started on McCoy , who speaks casually of the fact that Troglyte intellect ratings are so low that he does n't know why Kirk would bother negotiating directly with them before casually mentioning that mining zenite probably has something to do with why . It 's no wonder Vanna and her allies wo n't trust these Federation buffoons ! It 's quite clever of Kirk to force Plasus to experience how the Troglytes live first-hand , ordering Spock to beam him into the mine where he has trapped himself and Vanna , but then he leaves to go cure his plague , wagging a finger and suggesting that some Federation bureau of industrialization might be helpful , ignoring the fact that Plasus did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not care about what happened to the Troglytes . It seems apparent that ten seconds after Kirk beams up , Vanna is going right back into that torture device that one of her allies committed suicide to avoid and the Troglytes are staying down in the mines without their masks , where they 'll likely never be able to organize a real revolution against those living in the clouds . <p> It 's nice to see an episode that attempts to trace the causes and tactics of terrorism and how to deal with it . But these terrorists are preposterously idealistic despite the invisible gas that supposedly makes them hysterical - they attack sculptures rather than officials , they leap off buildings rather than using their mining tools for demolition , they have no plans to kill their hostages - The Next Generation 's Bajorans , and later the various cultures fighting the Dominion War , provided far better parallels with real world events . And Plasus is portrayed as entirely hypocritical and unreasonable , not as a sympathetic man trying to protect a way of life he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many questions underlines his pettiness and the sense that he knows he 's up to something the Federation would n't approve of . Even assuming that the screening process to be admitted as a Federation member was it looser in Kirk 's era than Picard 's , it is hard to believe that a planet which in essence practices slavery was never asked any hard questions about its practices . I really ca n't be sorry that Kirk does break the Prime Directive ! <p> There 's potentially a really good episode here , in which a society that essentially practices the classical humanism of the ancient world ( where the intellectuals could sit around writing plays and philosophy while others cleaned their latrines ) comes up against the desperate situation of a plague and must evolve or die , but the plague is set off in the distance and the underlying issues are never brought to the front .

Though initially skeptical , Picard has Data investigate unusual Starfleet directives .

Picard heads to Starfleet Command on Earth to investigate the matter and is told that he and Riker should beam down while the ship plays host to Picard 's friend Admiral Quinn , who had already warned the captain of a conspiracy while trying to persuade Picard to take over at Starfleet Academy .

Quinn recovers , but Data realizes that the queen sent a homing beacon deep into space before it died . <p> Analysis : Here is an example of an episode that starts well and drops the ball in every way - even to the end , where it implies that there will be a sequel that never arrives ( by this point fortunately ) ! We 've already had hints of a Starfleet conspiracy in " Coming of Age , " when Picard 's old friend Quinn was so concerned that he wanted to recruit Picard to become Commandant of Starfleet Academy to keep an eye on things .

Because they make humans EAT WORMS . <p> I ca n't write a fair review of " Conspiracy , " which really has a perfectly adequate first half , because I ca n't help remembering how it ends and how painfully laughable I found it the first time around - I was pretty ready to quit on the series , but the fans were hyping the return of the Romulans in the season finale and like a true Trekkie sucker I stuck with it . Do n't get me wrong , it would be worth watching " Conspiracy " just for the demented glee on Jonathan Frakes ' face when Riker breaks Picard 's heart and prepares to eat a handful of WORMS , then instead whips out a phaser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it goes laughably bad , hitting a cheese factor unparalleled even in the original series ' third season . Admirals possessed by BUGS ! Sitting around admiring them in their little briefcases ! <p> It would make a fun parody of a Next Gen episode , except it 's not . Crusher earnestly imploring Picard to shoot to kill ? Glee at watching hapless Remmick get blown apart as the host for evil aliens ? Riker and the WORMS ? And it starts so well , even seeming to understand how a joke can be played to overkill , with Geordi telling Data the end of a dirty joke about sex in zero gravity and Data attempting to figure out the humor . There 's a lovely , taut scene where Keel tries to make sure Picard has n't been compromised which gives us some backstory in a nutshell : Keel introduced Beverly to Jack Crusher , Picard was n't there , he did n't meet Beverly until later . We also discover that Starfleet 's finest young captain is a woman . And those tantalizing hints of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents - resolve in the chilling discovery of Keel 's ship in unrecognizable pieces of twisted metal . Finally Picard decides to trust Troi and let her do her job , though he declines her advice to inform others on the crew until he realizes that his own ship may be in danger . Like Picard before him , Riker is doubtful until he sees first-hand that something is very wrong with Starfleet 's finest . <p> And Quinn beats up a Klingon , and Crusher uses a phaser in order to discover that he 's got something akin to the infection from the original series ' " Operation : Annihilate ! " and it 's starting to look like things might work out despite the BUGS when we get the insane cocktail party and WORMS and the stupidest conspiracy dialogue ever , with talk about takeovers and covering tracks ... to qualify as ultimate clichT , it just needs someone to cackle madly like the Wicked Witch of the West . Because it would be impossible to top the worm-creature crawling out of Chekov 's ear in The Wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouths and go running to Mommy Remmick , looking like the poor special effects they are . " We mean you no harm , we seek peaceful coexistence " Remmick bleats before Picard and Riker shoot him . And somehow Remmick manages to send off a signal into deep space before he dies . <p> Now , what 's interesting in long retrospect is that one can see the beginnings of Next Gen 's superlative alien threat , the Borg , in how these creatures work : they assimilate only brains , so far as we can tell , except the queen , but there 's the same sense of infestation and helplessness in the face of an enemy who has stealthily conquered thousands . The TNG writers showed great wisdom in dropping the BUGS and concocting that much more interesting alien threat from afar . It 's obvious from " Conspiracy " that they were capable of setting up a mystery/horror arc and sustaining it across multiple episodes ... but it 's also obvious that at this point they had no idea how to finish it off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piller 's episodes will soon be on the way .

One of them is Annorax , leader of the Krenim . The other is Kathryn Janeway of the starship Voyager , who makes James T. Kirk in " The Naked Time " sound sane . <p> Annorax and Janeway are both chasing windmills across the decades . He wants to get back in time , she wants to get back in space . They 're both obsessed , and in love with their mechanical monstrosities that they use to try to make the galaxy do their bidding . At the end of the episode , we 're led to believe that the the insanity of Annorax is n't an inevitability - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who love him . One can only hope that this is true of Janeway , too . <p> I suppose I should talk about the curious decision to structure an episode on the model of a war between Captain Nemo and Captain Ahab . But I 'm too disgusted to do that , too bogged down in the predictability of the plot , the heavy-handedness of the symbolism and the unoriginality of the ending . I 'm going to ignore the ways this reminded me of a dozen other Reset Button Trek Tales , including Voyager 's own " Time and Again . " I 'm not going to ask why no one ever mentioned the timeline in which Kes encountered the Krenim - has she been wiped out of history , or just out of the fourth season ? OK , maybe I ca n't really ignore those things , but they 're not what made this episode irredeemable for me . Janeway did that . <p> Voyager 's writers accomplished something I had not believed possible . They had me cheering aloud when they killed Janeway off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fit to command , though I 'd love to know whom he thought was going to take over in her absence . I suppose she saved the galaxy , but it was sheer coincidence , since she did n't understand anything about the temporal problems she was dealing with . If she had , she would have kept her ship in that nebula for a few extra days . <p> As Annorax said in last week 's episode , the ability to alter time makes its linear progression irrelevant . Whether Janeway pursued him a day , a week , a decade later would not have mattered in the end , if she realized that resetting the clock would wipe out whatever came after the moment of incursion , and possibly what came before as well . She did n't have to risk her ship and remaining crew in her haste to engage the Krenim - if anything , her doing so could have led to their deaths before she stopped Annorax , thus permitting his timeline to succeed . Chakotay may have flunked quantum mechanics , but Janeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue . <p> I 'm not even going to wonder why this Janeway did n't evacuate non-scientist Neelix and blind Tuvok along with the rest of her crew - could n't she have made better use of a couple of engineering ensigns ? I do have to ask why she did n't deactivate the Doc right after he treated her . Keeping his program running just to fight about her competence seems like a waste of energy which he should have noted . It makes no sense that Doc was functioning at all , considering that Sickbay and the holodecks had been destroyed and most of the computer was offline . Well , Trek 's dependent on contrived science and technobabble , which can be tuned out when the people are compelling enough . So instead of worrying about plot holes , let 's stick with characterization , which is what always makes or breaks an episode for me . <p> These characters ? In " Year of Hell " ' s alternate timeline , Seven sounded a lot like Tuvok being logical , and Tuvok sounded a lot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which I mean pathetic ... a pre- " Scorpion " version who still worships Janeway for reasons which momentarily escape me , who can be talked into anything by anyone in a position of authority - even a genocidal maniac who kept him imprisoned for months . Paris sounded like the old Paris , too - he was angry , he was rebellious , yet he had principles and was competent in a crunch . Hmm , that last part also sounds like the new Tom Paris , the guy who can pilot the ship while running sickbay and engineering singlehandedly . All his girlfriend B'Elanna can do lately is miss him . The characters were close but not quite there ... which could be clever writing to tell us it 's not our universe , or it could just be that the writers never get them consistently in the first place . <p> Ah , the heck with the cast . We 're in an alternate timeline , so none of it counts . Right ? Maybe . <p> About that watch , which Janeway was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Is it supposed to represent linear , old-fashioned time , which is here portrayed as " natural " while manipulation is supposed to be unnatural , even though we 've learned from other Trek episodes that multiple timelines always exist simultaneously ? Or , since it was a gift of affection from one person to another , is the watch supposed to represent the connections between people which transcend time , like Annorax 's love for his wife ? Chakotay said it 's a replica of the watch of a British captain who brought his ship in after everyone had stopped knowing or caring that he was still out there . That 's not how he said it , of course , but that 's what I heard . I doubt the singlemindedness of Captain Cray would make an interesting subject for a serial television show . ( Annorax , on the other hand , would fit right in on Sliders . ) <p> Anyway , the watch ca n't possibly represent the connection between Janeway and Chakotay , since he does n't seem to register on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She generally prefers holograms to live people . Maybe that 's why she 's so in love with her ship . Though Janeway keeps declaring that her crew is a family - she used that word about a half-dozen times in the two parts of this episode - she never shows that feeling . There are no subtle , compelling bonds between her and any other character . Oh , there 's occasional chemistry between her and Chakotay when she 's not playing the Ice Queen , and occasional warmth between her and Tuvok when he 's not ridiculously over the top . Hugging on the bridge ? And he 's supposed to be a full Vulcan ? If Chakotay 's crush on Janeway seems misguided , Tuvok 's is just embarrassing . <p> It 's sad that Starfleet captains have to resort to a " family " analogy to indicate interpersonal feelings which transcend crew loyalties . But I do n't believe it anyway . If there 's one thing this episode makes amply clear , it 's that Janeway loves nobody more than Voyager , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what she 'd think of Kirk blowing up the Enterprise in The Search For Spock , giving up his precious machine , and his Starfleet position , in a joint quest to save his best friend . Janeway seems to see Voyager as an extension of herself . She 'll probably get it home , same as Annorax got his wife back , but that wo n't make her selfish means justify the ends . <p> At the end of the episode , the " real " Janeway did n't violate Kremin space . But she did do similar things in " The Swarm " and " The Raven " and various other episodes , so I ca n't say she was out of character . Maybe I should be pleased with how she held it together rather than worrying about her crazed devotion to her mission - we never saw Kirk or Picard get beat up this badly , perhaps she 's really the strongest of the three . But Janeway was n't working to restore the timeline for the good of the universe . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was as obsessed with her personal goals for the ship as Annorax was with a scrap of red hair , and we 've seen her act that way in the so-called " real " timeline .

" does not remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get of Kirk interacting with family members , and his determination to save his nephew causes tension between himself and both Uhura and McCoy . It 's also a rare glimpse of Spock with his control eroded almost to the breaking point as he fights the pain with which the alien creatures are bombarding him , trying to force him to do their will . In terms of characterization and the performances of the series regulars ; this is a very strong installment . It 's too bad viewers must sit through Aurelan Kirk 's over-the-top death scene , the Attack of the Flying Barf Monster and the inanity of the eighteen medical labs on the ship not having tried UV rays when they tested the creatures for sensitivity to radiation . <p> The episode is helped greatly by the pacing , which starts with a bang with a Denevan flying himself into the sun , and the on-location shoot , which features a lot of staircases to run down and courtyards filled with strange-looking artwork to creep across . We learn almost immediately from Spock that galactic mass insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family there . It 's a tragedy of the episode that we never really meet Kirk 's brother - he is dead on the floor by the time Kirk 's away team bursts inside - and our only glimpse of his sister-in-law is as one of Star Trek 's all too frequent damsels in distress wailing that she needs help . In this case , Aurelan actually seems to be one of the stronger Denevans , for the men we see are crazed with violence even while they 're warning Kirk and his team away . <p> It 's also a shame that we never see even a token scene between Kirk and his nephew , who remains unconscious throughout the crisis ; even a single moment of melancholy farewell would have been nice , and an improvement over the forced humor of the tag , when no matter how relieved Kirk may be to have Spock back at his position , he still must be hurting a great deal over his brother 's death . Sam is more of an idea of a character than someone real , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it affects Spock ; we do n't hear a single memory from Kirk about their childhoods , their relationship , whether Kirk attended his wedding , what sort of relationship he has with this nephew given that we learn there has been no contact with Deneva in over a year . <p> The loveliest scenes are Spock 's - when he is first infected by the aliens and trying not to scream as Kirk helps him stand , when he goes mad and tries to take over the ship , and then as he learns to control his pain , needing enough fight to snap out of his sickbay restraints to try to return to the planet 's surface without giving in to the impulse to obey the aliens . Kirk is more visibly temperamental than Spock is - it is the captain who may have to make the decision to kill all the colonists to stop the spread of the madness , as well as his nephew and first officer - but there is a quiet moment where Spock , ending a conversation with Kirk and McCoy , allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Vulcan speaks of utter agony . It is rather entertaining to watch him fight Scotty in his efforts to leave the ship , though Scotty has a very fine moment pulling a phaser on him and taking control of the situation . The scenes in which the aliens are discussed tend to be embarrassing ; even in pain , Spock babbling that the aliens may come from a realm where physical laws do not apply just sounds silly , though perhaps it is necessary for Kirk to be the scientific genius who suggests trying intense light to affect the creatures when McCoy 's radiation tests have failed . <p> The real pathos of Spock 's blinding is that Kirk and McCoy seem far more devastated by it than Spock himself . He is so relieved to be out of pain that not even the news that his blinding was unnecessary rattles him , though Kirk can barely look at his first officer and friend , ordering McCoy to take care of him and racing out of sickbay . When he later tries to comfort McCoy he does so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays his return to duty for maximum shock value , announcing almost as an afterthought that he had forgotten about his inner eyelid - perhaps he knows that Kirk will predictably ask him whether regaining his vision was an emotional experience , allowing Spock to joke about the hideousness of beholding Dr. McCoy 's face as the first thing he could see . It 's nice to know that McCoy thinks Spock is the best first officer in the fleet , but , again , the ending feels rather forced after the tragedy that Kirk has just undergone . <p> " Operation : Annihilate ! " has quite a bit in common with the horror movie body-snatcher staple plot ; it would have been nice to catch a glimpse of a few more Denevans , larger crowds of extras closing in on the crew as in " Return of the Archons " or some hint of people fleeing to build the ships we hear the aliens are forcing them to construct so they can spread their madness . I suppose for budgetary reasons it was necessary to explain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode a bit of a hollow feeling instead of the gut-twisting feeling from actually seeing a civilization gone mad .

" It may not even be the best Janeway/Chakotay episode , since there 's a strong case to be made for the third seasons " Coda .

I am Mary Scott-Wiecek , better known in Voyager circles as monkee , fanfic writer and reviewer . I have never , ever been an even remotely unbiased reviewer . This is due to my refusal to blame the characters for anything those bad , bad writers , directors and producers force them to do . This is an astoundingly illogical approach , but there you have it . None of that matters here , though , because , of course , there 's not a thing wrong with this episode . Nope , not a single thing ! <p> Michelle : I 'm not a big reader of romance novels , but I am familiar with the Desert Island trope from pon farr fan fiction , namely the idea that if you strand two people who already have lots of chemistry and unresolved sexual tension for long enough without any other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something about it or at least talk about it . So " Resolutions " may have a giant cliche of a plot not radically different in some ways from " Attached " which is the equivalent Picard/Crusher episode but let 's face it , we do n't  actually care what sort of cheesy plot throws Janeway and Chakotay together . Nor do we mind all the time wasted talking to primates and building bathtubs , because we figure there must be a payoff coming . <p> Mary : Cliche ? Absolutely . But it 's also a deeply rooted human desire to be with your beloved , alone , surrounded by natural beauty . They write songs about it ! " I believe in fires at midnight , when the dogs have all been fed . Golden toddy on the mantle , broken gun beneath the bed . " ( Jethro Tull . ) Or " Our house is a very , very , very fine house .

It also helped that Janeway and Chakotay had two seasons of solid development behind them . They were two strong , appealing characters with established chemistry . Once the initial premise was set up , who would n't want to see what happened next ? <p> Michelle : I 'm perfectly aware that I should be embarrassed , calling myself a feminist and at the same time admitting that my absolute favorite Janeway episode is the one in which she is n't the captain in which she declines that title , inviting her first officer to call her by her first name in which the shows writers prove that , as they hinted and as I feared all along , they have a hard time imagining that a woman can be a commander and at the same time a well-rounded sensitive , emotional , sexual individual . I 'm aware as well that in the years since " Resolutions " first aired , we 've developed a much broader vocabulary for discussing gender and sexuality , but my interest here is n't whether Janeway might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be demisexual or aromantic , all of which could be argued as possibilities . I 'm still interested in the ways in which Janeway was a breakthrough character for mainstream television before we as a culture started discussing the problems with binary gender and sexuality . I still beat myself up for asking the question of why Janeway seemed so interesting to me as part of a pairing , since Ive never believed that a woman needs a relationship to be complete . <p> Janeway is very different from Kirk , Picard , and Sisko Kirk was always interested in relationships but rarely in monogamy , Picard largely chose to be solitary , Sisko was in mourning when we met him and later became involved in a relationship that had to become secondary , not to his position as a Starfleet captain , but to his role as the Emissary . We know that Janeway feels painfully conflicted at the thought of moving on from the man she left back home , that she enjoys her friendships with crewmembers , that she craves distraction enough to kiss holograms , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthier for everyone if she allows herself to explore relationships . With nearly everyone on the ship , I 'd buy the argument that the disparity in power creates serious issues in fact , I might argue that of her relationship with Chakotay later on , after " Scorpion " when she pulls rank a few times . But not yet certainly not here . Is it progress for women to insist that a woman must be alone to demonstrate that she can be alone , even in the 24th century ? <p> Mary : I do n't think there 's any need to be embarrassed about being a feminist and loving this episode . I see Janeway as a very strong and admirable person on New Earth . I always thought that Chakotay was just a little quick to go into homesteading mode , but Janeway attempts to work the problem until it becomes impossible , then goes about the difficult and courageous business of changing her life goals and her entire sense of self . The New Earth sets , costumes , and music scream ROMANCE , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeway character to the situation . In fact , re-watching it now , I 'm struck by how much she reminds me of Picard as Kamin , who goes through a similar transition in the Next Generation episode " The Inner Light . " <p> What I am rather embarrassed about is that I wholeheartedly believed that Janeway and Chakotay had , indeed , entered into a relationship in this episode , which continued well into the third season . For months , I believed this ! I was thrilled at how well it was working out ! Look ! ' I thought to myself . She is the Captain , yet she can balance that with a relationship . Yes ! ' After a while , of course , I was forced to conclude that I was sadly mistaken , because if the writers had really decided to go this way , they 'd have already overtly addressed it . I 'm embarrassed by my cluelessness , but I also see it as evidence that the relationship could have worked out just fine , at least at first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courageous enough to take the plunge . <p> I do agree that as the series went on , and the crew 's journey became more difficult , the relationship might have become problematic . I see that more as a function of her being a commander than of her being a woman . I ca n't truly imagine Kirk or Picard being able to pull it off , either . Perhaps the writers and producers reached that conclusion as well , but it would also have been interesting to see the romantic relationship end and morph back into a friendship while the professional relationship continued . The writers were too meek . Perhaps they did n't really believe that it was impossible for a woman to lead and still be a well-rounded , emotional and sexual being , they just did n't want to tackle it because it was too messy and difficult , like real life . Too bad , though . <p> Michelle : I was n't sure until seasons later , during " Shattered " when a Janeway who never went to the Delta Quadrant asks Chakotay just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some barriers they never cross that we werent meant to believe Janeway and Chakotay were lovers while they were stranded on New Earth . But I was pretty sure from their behavior during " Basics " and afterward that the moment they got back to the ship , they did not resume any relationship they might have had on the planet . Romance on Star Trek is more soap opera-ish than on many nighttime soaps , since romance on Star Trek often involves people getting possessed by alien spores , being forced to read each others thoughts , catching some variation of the " Naked Time " condition , etc. etc. etc . Except on the very mature Deep Space Nine , nearly all relationships are fleeting and real love does n't  much factor in . Kirk was never fond of commitment and Picard had trouble opening up to friends as well as lovers , but Sisko showed us that a Starfleet captain could have a long , lasting relationship even with a woman whod betrayed everything he stood for by aligning with the Maquis . <p> I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Janeway and Chakotay would have been problematic . " Resolutions " shows us how well they work together apart from their roles on the ship . People who are as compatible as they are and who clearly enjoy one anothers company and seem to appreciate one anothers superficial features have been known to fall in love , even when its inconvenient or inappropriate , and make it work because they know that their joint goals are more important than their personal egos . In fact , I think it would have solved some of the problems of having a captain isolated from Starfleet by having Janeway and Chakotay have a relationship . The writers rarely let Chakotay start arguments , let alone win them , because it weakened Janeways image as the captain , since her first officer is n't supposed to be challenging her orders , especially given his Maquis background . But if they were committed on a personal level , they could have quarreled privately as equals , which would have made the arguments more dramatically interesting and demonstrated that people with real leadership skills can separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mary : Perhaps it 's just as well . The writers attempts to handle that kind of nuance in this series would just have made us mad ! I wanted to like Paris and Torres , but their dialog sometimes sounded like it came right out of I Love Lucy ! Maybe it all comes down to the fact that they really did n't want to do story arcs , though the storyline of Voyager really would have benefitted from them . Sigh . <p> Michelle : I liked the idea of Paris and Torres as a couple much more than the execution I felt that a lot of what made Torres a unique and powerful character was sacrificed to the relationship but I was never as invested in them as a couple in the first place , since the show gave us far less reason to be until just before deciding to make them a couple . It would have made more sense for their relationship to be developed all along they have a lot in common , from father issues to Maquis pasts not grounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seeing the other at their worst . But its Janeway and Chakotay we see flirting over breakfast foods and laughing over mating behavior . Sure , it would have been interesting to have a female captain portrayed as fully self-contained the sort they would n't have had to saddle with a Mark back home in the first place , not worrying that we might not see her as a Real Woman otherwise but that 's not the Janeway I adored from " Caretaker . " She was never chilly or isolated . Marks existence was always a story arc headed for doom . <p> When " Resolutions " aired , I was n't worried about whether Janeway could cope alone at the top . Until the nightmare that was " Night , " I still believed she could if she had to . I just did n't  see why she should have to , based on a protocol owing more to 20th century prudery than what I imagine 24th century human attitudes about sexuality might be . Even 20 years after this episode first aired , I look at Janeway and Chakotay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , have developed a strong friendship , share laughs , have similar values , trust each other , and seemingly cant keep their eyes off each other . Why couldnt they have continued to explore that on the ship , whether or not they explored it romantically on New Earth ? <p> Mary : I would love to have seen them try . It might have been extraordinary and inspiring . It might have even set Voyager apart . Fifteen years later , it seems to me that Voyager does not command much respect among the general Star Trek fandom . <p> Michelle : Maybe that 's because after this episode , every single time Chakotay says , " My people have a saying " , we all assume it to be made-up nonsense ! But I ca n't help feeling that more than my sense of romance is let down by the lack of follow-up to " Resolutions . " It feeds into my entire sense of Star Treks sense of optimism about the future . If we can erase racism , sexism , and speciesism , cant we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harassment ? Imagine a world where people decide who and how to love without prejudices about rank , social position , possibly even gender as determined by biology . Its a final frontier Star Trek never managed to traverse in a satisfactory way , and when I think about where that could have changed , I always end up back in the shelter on New Earth where Janeway and Chakotay are holding hands , imagining a future together . It is , to me , an absolutely perfect moment . <p> Mary : Sigh . It still bums me out , but Voyager gave me many good friends , so , silver lining ! <p> Michelle : For me too . Ive known Mary for 20 years because of Voyager ! " Resolutions " was central to the Janeway/Chakotay fan community , which is still going strong in social media all this time later . For that reason alone , I cant imagine anything ever replacing it as my favorite hour of television .

While a landing party investigates , a group of Klingons arrives and their captain , Kang , accuses Kirk of having destroyed his ship . When Chekov accuses the Klingons of having killed his only brother and is captured and tortured by them , Kirk has no choice but to give them passage on the Enterprise , though he warns Spock to be prepared and puts the Klingons in a modified holding cell . A series of disasters sends the ship careening into interstellar space while most of the crew is trapped belowdecks due to a failure of the bulkheads . Soon the Klingons have escaped and all the energy weapons aboard have been turned into swords .

With the help of Kang 's wife and science officer Mara , Kirk is able to convince the Klingons to make peace and to bond over mutual disdain for the creature , which leaves the ship . <p> Analysis : An episode which reads at times better than it plays , " Day of the Dove " gives most members of the original series cast plenty of opportunities for overacting and they make the most of them . At times one gets the impression that writer Jerome Bixby wanted to see sword-fighting on the Enterprise and came up with a scenario to allow it : the scene where Scotty walks into the armory to find that all the phasers have been turned into different styles of antique swords , like a magnificent Renaissance Faire weapons display , is quite enjoyable but also absurdly anachronistic . One can explain away the more outrageous behavior of the crew because the Evil Pinwheel Entity affects everyone 's behavior , but that does n't mean they do n't look pretty silly at times . <p> Thematically , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep Space Nine would revisit the concept of two armies killing one another and coming back to life to fight again in " Battle Lines " , and there are some interesting parallels to be drawn between Kirk 's insistence on a balance of power in " A Private Little War " and the alien balancing act here , where it becomes obvious that sometimes having equal sides gives each of them just enough hope of victory that they will keep fighting indefinitely . Kang is n't as overconfident as Kor nor as pompous as Koloth ; he and Kirk make solid adversaries , each believing he has a legitimate grievance and each convinced that the other is capable of thoughtless , savage destruction . <p> It 's also a delightful surprise to meet Mara , a senior officer on Kang 's ship as well as his wife - given that we have seen no evidence of equal treatment for Klingon women before , how wonderful that she as much as Kirk must convince Kang to change his mind . This episode led me to believe that Klingon women must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Starfleet , and I was irate when the Duras sisters showed up on The Next Generation to say it was n't usually so . Though she wears so much eye makeup that one fears she may collapse under the weight of it , and though she is distressingly passive for much of the episode - despite coming from a warrior culture , she barely struggles when a maddened Chekov tries to rape her - Mara demonstrates that Klingon women may be as educated and empowered as the men , and it 's a shame we never get to see her again . <p> Perhaps because he is shown to be a family man , Michael Ansara 's Kang gets to be something Kor and Koloth never really do : a brooding , sexy anti-hero . Despite ordering his men to torture Chekov in the early minutes of the episode , he is never the villain of the story , for Kirk 's impulses are just as violent from the time he beams down and William Shatner 's portrayal of Kirk 's rage and frustration is far less subtle than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have swords in their hands and they each control one part of the ship , or think they do . Kang appears to distribute power among his men in much the same way that Kirk does ; he does n't allow his subordinates to contradict him , but he listens to what they have to say even when he disagrees , counseling patience rather than a rush to fight even after he has come under the influence of the alien . He is n't an egotist like Khan who wastes time torturing the crew ; he wants to take engineering , bring the ship into Klingon space and then worry about punishing Kirk for the deaths of Klingon crewmembers . <p> Unfortunately , as the characters come further under the influence of the Evil Pinwheel Entity , their dark sides are balanced by a tendency to pontificate . Kirk rightly realizes that both McCoy and Spock are espousing racist beliefs that contradict their usual attitudes , but instead of simply pointing this out to them , he makes speeches . " We 've been trained to think in other terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , if necessary , " he announces . " Has a war been staged for us , complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating ... even race hatred ? " It 's a clumsy declaration , laying out in words things that are already evident to the viewing audience from the actions of the crew ... though I must admit that in the political climate of 2006 , it 's rather resonant . <p> In the end it 's laughter that does in the Evil Pinwheel Alien , much like Harry Potter 's Boggarts , and it flees the ship as the combined Starfleet and Klingon crews ridicule it , though the tension is n't entirely diffused ( " We need no urging to hate humans , " declares Kang ) . There 's a lot to be said for the idea of Hatred as an externalized , alien force which is itself the enemy , far more so than whoever one happens to hate , for whatever reason . Even presented with evidence that these Klingons have no weapons of mass destruction ... that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far away , Kirk disregards facts in favor of insisting that they must somehow be responsible for something , or soon will be . Meanwhile Kang and Mara have no problem believing exactly the same of humans , given that they have heard stories of Federation death camps and the sort of mindless brutality that McCoy - McCoy ! - espouses under the influence of the alien . <p> Interestingly , Kirk and Spock realize that if they do not succeed in forming a truce , they will be fated to wander forever between galaxies with madmen at their throats .

When Kirk orders the pilot and crew beamed aboard , he discovers that the ship has only a captain , Harcourt Fenton Mudd , and three beautiful women whom he intends to deliver to settlers on a colony searching for wives . The women have an unusual effect on the male crewmembers , distracting them from their duties ; even McCoy and Scotty are charmed , though McCoy is not so muddled that he fails to notice that one of the women sets off strange readings on his medical scanners . Mudd proves to be a smuggler and counterfeiter , and the beautiful women are artificial as well : he has been giving them a drug to make them more erotic and alluring .

The miners discover the fraud but decide that wives who can cook and sew will make more suitable companions than beautiful sexpots anyway , and Kirk takes Mudd back for trial . <p> Analysis : Along with " Spock 's Brain " , " Turnabout Intruder " and " That Which Survives " , this is one of the episodes I 've most dreaded rewatching , let alone reviewing . I believe that I have only seen it twice previously , compared to probably 50 viewings of " Amok Time " and " City on the Edge of Forever " , if that tells you anything about how much I hate it . If you dislike reading feminist rants , I recommend that you skip this review , because I honestly do n't know how to talk about " Mudd 's Women " without such issues coming up , unless I focus on things like the phony-looking magnetic storm with the little pieces of paper that get caught in Kirk 's hair or the Trek evolutionary details , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilithium crystals and it uses battery power for backup , apparently without impulse engines . <p> Because this is such a very early episode , and because it originally aired in 1966 , I am willing to cut " Mudd 's Women " a very slight amount of slack ; as painful as it is to watch , it does n't disgust me quite as much as Enterprise 's " Bound " , which offers precisely the same phony-pheromone , **27;1387;TOOLONG garbage yet was written nearly 30 years later . I suppose that Gene Roddenberry , who wrote the story for Stephen Kandel 's teleplay , might have imagined that he was saying something progressive about beauty being more than skin-deep in the end when Eve started blabbing about how she would make a better wife for a miner because she could cook and sew and need him rather than being vain and selfish , but it 's really hard not to loathe Kirk and Spock for failing to point out that she has many other options - that she could get a job or an education or sue Mudd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there for a woman who could do so much better than tying herself to a miner whose only redeeming quality , as he points out at least three times , is that he does n't beat or rape her . <p> It 's hard to know how much of Eve , Magda and Ruth 's backstories can be believed because they describe them under duress , but apparently all come from planets where the subjugation of women is taken for granted and where getting a man is the most important thing they can accomplish . When Kirk asks if they came with Mudd voluntarily , they explain that they 've basically lived as slaves , cooking and cleaning for their brothers and fathers . Now , as Eve protests , " We 've got men willing to be our husbands ... and you 're staring at us as if we were harem girls or something ! " Clearly someone has coached them in the art of seduction , probably Mudd , since he 's the one ordering them to distract specific crewmembers so he can learn about the miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . All of the women are terrified of being discovered to be ugly ; they have no confidence in their beauty or sex appeal without the drugs , presumably no one ever told them that they had beauty or sex appeal before the drugs , and Eve is as stunned as the miner she ends up tying herself to when she learns that she can be sexy and charming merely by believing that she is . <p> There 's no moral judgment implied in the episode about this trafficking in women . Mudd may be a smuggler and a cheat , but he is treated as a roguish , affable troublemaker , not a villain . He steps off the transporter padd like a cross between a cowboy and a pirate with his big hat , outlandish moustache , bright shirt and earring ; Spock 's response to him is to smirk , both there and when he lies to the computer which is almost as good at detecting his fibs as Kirk .

" He 's a Vulcanian , " Mudd helpfully explains to his women , which to him means that Spock is only attracted to pretty girls when he allows himself to be .

Soon after , the ship is attacked by a vessel on a collision course that beams aboard its only passenger - Bele , who is black on the right half of his body and white on the left . Bele claims to be an official from Cheron in pursuit of the insurgent Lokai , but Lokai insists that Bele and his people have oppressed Lokai 's people , and the entire basis of Bele 's prejudice is based on Lokai 's skin color .

Plus it has Batman 's Riddler , a.k.a . Frank Gorshin , in a lead role . <p> Yet rewatching the third season of the original series has held some revelations for me , one of which is that the episodes which are high-minded are n't necessarily the ones I enjoy most . " Spock 's Brain " is a nightmare of characterization , plot and values but it 's undeniably hilarious , whereas " Let That Be Your Last Battlefield " plods . It urgently lacks humor . It requires Kirk to be stiff and uncomfortable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like they 're targeted at children . Maybe audiences needed things stated so obviously in the 1960s , but I find it hard to believe that the average Star Trek viewer was so dense . <p> Thus , while the episode is mildly engaging as a historical curiosity , it does n't grab the emotions , even when nightmarish things are occurring like men learning of the deaths of everyone on their planet . It all feels more like an allegory than something happening to real people ; the men of Cheron might as well be Doctor Seuss 's Sneetches , half of whom have bellies with stars and half of whom have no stars upon thars . It 's almost embarrassing to be subjected to a story that portrays racism in such black-and-white terms , which Kirk and Spock earnestly try to apply to human history in ways that require vagueness and generalizations instead of specifics of the sort that make episodes like " A Private Little War " more effective . <p> It also does n't help that these are supposed to be super-aliens , engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the Enterprise 's controls to a malfunctioning child 's toy .

Kirk is reduced to spouting platitudes which are n't nearly as interesting as those he used against much more powerful and intractable aliens like Apollo . Meanwhile freedom fighter Lokai is kept largely in the background ; we get a glimpse of Sulu listening to one of his impassioned speeches for freedom , but he does n't have enough of a platform to sound like a Martin Luther King , Jr . <p> There is something comical about the moment when Bele realizes that Kirk and the others genuinely do n't understand the reason he believes himself to be superior : " It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that Lokai is of the same breed as Bele , the latter asks whether Spock is blind and points out that he is black on the right side ; Lokai is white on the right side . " All of his people are white on the right side .

" There is no persecution on your planet . How can you understand my fear , my apprehension , my degradation , my suffering ? " When Chekov explains that he read about human persecution in his history class , Sulu points out that that was way back in the 20th century , a sort of primitive thinking that just does n't happen on Earth of their era .

Spock and Kirk hypothesize that Bele and Lokai must have common ancestors - something McCoy presumably could prove with a DNA test , though no one suggests that - yet it is unclear whether the racial distinction on Cheron falls along geographic lines or whether Bele 's people were indeed breeding Lokai 's as slaves , as Lokai suggests . Is there a lesson here for intelligent humans ? Sadly , I suspect it 's that when any theory of racial conflict is reduced to absolute black and white with no shades of gray , it inevitably seems nanve , moralistic and a little dull .

( I know that the clip show " Shades of Gray " is widely regarded as the worst not only of the second season but the entire series , but I do n't remember it being as tedious as this one felt upon rewatching . ) There are many pointless scenes , and others that simply seem to drag on endlessly .

And it 's pretty sad to meet an Alien Menace and think that the black slime from " Skin of Evil " was more interesting and more creative . <p> The characters do n't fare much better than the plot of this exercise . Which is the real Riker - the one who thinks nostalgically about legends of ships that sailed off the edge of the world , or Mister " Let 's get the hell out of here ! " ? Which is the real Worf - the cautious , prudent one who wants to go to Yellow Alert before Picard is ready to acknowledge a threat , or the one who thinks a good offense is the best defense ?

Troi is thankfully spared any dialogue about sensing malevolence or menace , but given that that 's all she ever talked about first season , she seems passive and uninvolved , so that by the time it 's a phony version of her telling Picard to give in to Nagilum 's demands , it 's really difficult to tell the difference . We see Worf having a tantrum of sorts on the holodeck at the start , so when he loses his cool on the fake Yamato , again , it 's hard to say whether this is Worf under extreme duress or just what Worf is going to be like as a Klingon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in awhile . If Kirk had half his crew threatened with death , he would seethe . He would n't become pensive and then , in the end , calmly tell the aggressor that they share curiosity as a common trait .

Picard has a long speech about death that he delivers to faux-Data about how mortals want their reality to be more than what they understand it to be , but it 's not clear whether this philosophy or the imminent self-destruct is what convinces Nagilum to let them go so he can play with humans another day .

Seven claims that he is a human trained by aliens to help protect Earth , but although McCoy is able to confirm that he is indeed human , Seven escapes before the captain can discover his mission . Kirk and Spock beam down to New York City , where Seven has discovered that his fellow agents have died and he has inadvertently revealed too much about his plans to secretary Roberta Lincoln , who becomes his assistant .

Kirk and Spock discover Seven interfering with the rocket that will carry it , but before they can stop him , he is rescued from the scene by Roberta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make the decision to trust Seven , allowing him to detonate the nuclear bomb more than a hundred miles above Earth 's surface before it lands and starts a war . <p> Analysis : Despite plot holes big enough to derail the potential series for which " Assignment : Earth " was to have been the pilot , this remains a very enjoyable episode , all the more so for me because of what happened in the interim since the last time I watched it : namely , I became a Doctor Who fan . Suddenly some of Gary Seven 's quirks -- like the time travel via what looks like typical Earth-based devices and the mightier-than-the-sword pen that substitutes for a sonic screwdriver -- remind me of the classic British science fiction series , which makes me wonder whether that was one of NBC 's reasons for not picking it up independently . The theme seems similar too , though Gary Seven is a human raised by aliens rather than an alien and we see little evidence that he plans to meddle outside of Earth 's own history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen the way they were supposed to , and we have a logical if regrettably deus ex machina explanation of how humans did survive what Sargon called their primitive nuclear era . <p> What makes the storyline work is the chemistry among the actors and the fun they 're obviously having . It 's mind-boggling that Starfleet would risk contaminating the timeline just to study a nuclear crisis , and even more mind-boggling that Spock does n't confirm Seven 's story with a gimmick well-established in previous episodes , the mind-meld . Plus it is n't very bright of Kirk to bring his Vulcan first officer on the away team , rather than letting him do the scientific studies Scotty is carrying out on the Enterprise while letting the human chief engineer ( who could n't be unmasked by Roberta Lincoln like Spock ) tinker with Seven 's machines . Despite logic , however , it 's fun to have Spock there to see Roberta 's reaction to him ; it 's just as well Spock does n't think of reading Seven 's mind , because it would diminish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Starfleet had n't authorized such a silly mission , it would have been pretty difficult to explain another accident like the one with the black hole from " Tomorrow Is Yesterday .

No woman 's taste was ever that bad ! ) Seven , too , seems to have gotten his ideas about espionage not from studying actual CIA and Defense Department operatives , but by watching Star Trek 's fellow Desilu production , Mission : Impossible , which despite the science fiction element " Assignment : Earth " resembles . None of this interferes with the fun of watching a single installment , and it 's not like Mission : Impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's outfits were almost as bad as Garr 's here ) . But I can see why the series never took off . <p> The commentary on the Sixties remains interesting , with Kirk asking what 's going on during the period they 're visiting Earth and Spock offhandedly citing an assassination and a coup in Asia as well as the launching of the nuclear missile platform . Spock is perfectly delightful in this episode : he ca n't stop petting Seven 's cat any more than he could help himself with the tribbles , he wears hats almost as painful to look at as Roberta 's outfits , he tells Kirk in a calm voice that having no time for logic , they will have to rely on intuition . Maybe he does n't want to mind-meld with Seven for some reason -- he might find out that most of the nuclear near-misses of the era required alien intervention to halt . Seven tells Kirk repeatedly that if he hinders him , Kirk will destroy Earth and start World War III -- this is n't minor meddling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's benefactors remain shrouded in mystery on a planet that even the Vulcans have never been able to detect . <p> In his history of the rise and fall of Khan , writer Greg Cox brought back Gary Seven , Roberta Lincoln and Isis to superb effect ; these are probably my favorite Star Trek novels ever , and bring up a lot of might-have-beens both for the " Assignment : Earth " series that never was and the alternate history of the world in which the Eurasian war did break out . I 'd have been happy to watch more episodes with Seven knocking people out with his pen 's happy-ray and Lincoln trying to figure out how to serve her country and fix it at the same time , but this time around I find that the character who most intrigues me is Isis , the shape-shifting cat who always seems to know more than she 's telling .

Both the men and women are descendants of a culture whose technology they no longer understand , and the women have taken Spock 's brain to serve as Controller for the computer system that regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Spock 's body , using a remote-control device to make him move , and learns along with Kirk of a device called the Teacher that can temporarily transmit knowledge to the women . McCoy puts it on to learn how to reattach Spock 's brain , but he begins to forget before the operation is finished and a barely conscious Spock must talk him through it . Meanwhile Kirk suggests to the women that they move to the surface of the planet with the men and find ways to keep warm that do n't require a Controller . <p> Analysis : There are episodes of Star Trek that fall apart in the final minutes , like " The Omega Glory " , and there are episodes of Star Trek that are poorly paced , like " Metamorphosis " . There are episodes of Star Trek that are painfully sexist , like " The Man Trap " , and there are episodes of Star Trek that are just sort of doofy , like " Who Mourns for Adonais ? " But of all the bad episodes of Star Trek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw-dropping awfulness ... and this is how the original series kicked off its third season . The only way to make it tolerable is to scream crude comments at the screen during the most atrocious scenes , like giving McCoy advice about which of Spock 's body parts he should move next while he 's testing the reconnected ganglia . <p> Watching it again after all these years , I confess that I found the episode hilarious and not in the least boring , even though I know it well enough to recite along with it ... " Brain and brain , what is brain ? " Nothing about the episode makes any sense at all - not why the women choose a Starfleet vessel to search for a Controller when they could presumably go directly to Vulcan or somewhere else and have their pick of many fine brains , not why she left the body intact and cared for - well , maybe that 's because Spock without a brain is only slightly less intelligent than the people of Sigma Draconis 6 - not why the Controller is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots and tinfoil leotards . I suspect that the costumes , like the sets , the staging of the fights and most of the performances , were chosen to be as outrT as the script . If " Spock 's Brain " had been written to be a parody of the worst in science fiction , it could hardly have done a better job . <p> I do n't find this episode as agonizingly misogynistic as " Turnabout Intruder " or even " That Which Survives " - and the latter is far less funny and more boring - though I do want to smack Kirk at the end when he suggests that the women find some way to control their men without pain belts and move to the surface to become cave-wives . Obviously they did something right if they 're the ones controlling the underground technology and enslaving the men , even if they need a male brain to run their entire society . For once Kirk does n't check out every babe in a skirt - it never occurs to him to use seduction to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the women are weaker than the Enterprise crew , not because they 're female , but because they 're untrained in physical fighting because they count on their electronics to do their tough stuff for them . This is essentially the same storyline as " The Apple " except the men and women already know how to reproduce and the all-powerful Controller that has prevented the society from developing has been stolen from the Enterprise ; there are no Prime Directive issues here , and Kirk promises to send advisors to help everyone acclimatize to living together on the surface . <p> William Shatner takes a lot of crap for his Star Trek acting style , but really , given the kind of dialogue he must contend with in episodes like this one , I think he does a rather miraculous job of making Kirk believable and sympathetic . Kirk must play a hunch about which of the three Sigma Draconis planets might be playing host to Spock 's brain , and agonizes , " If I guess wrong , Mr. Spock is dead . Spock will die ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the absurdity of the scenario . He has to march around demanding , " What have you done with Spock 's brain ? " to women who give him straight-faced , wide-eyed blank stares and ask politely what a brain is , since it 's something they apparently lack . And there 's that sweet moment on the surface when Kirk starts instinctively to call to Spock , only to realize it 's Scotty standing beside him . Shatner and Doohan both play this very well -- enough that one can forget , for a moment , the idiotic plot to bring Robo-Spock down to the surface . <p> For me , the best way to watch this episode is through slash fan glasses - that is , to assume that the entire original series is a subtextual romance between Kirk and Spock , and in this installment , a panicked , pouting Kirk must rescue his beloved from the evil horde of bimbos who have no proper appreciation for his body . There are many delightful moments for K/S fans , particularly the numerous times Spock 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to gaze longingly at Spock 's animated corpus as if perhaps it will throw its arms around him and shout , " JIM ! " like at the end of " Amok Time " when Spock had thought Kirk was dead . Miraculously , the brain-voice sounds just like Spock , though the women did n't steal his vocal cords , and Spock tells Kirk that " there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice ! " I do n't even have to make this stuff up ! <p> McCoy has a couple of great moments , first asking Chekov to please send him stomach down when a lift drops very quickly from the surface , then regretting that he reconnected Spock 's mouth after the surgery . In my household there were also several questions from the 12-and-under crowd about whether McCoy could control parts other than Spock 's arms and legs with that remote control , making it very difficult for me to keep a straight face , though the kids ' primary interest was more in the toilet humor direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spocks to lonely fans . I know , we 're supposed to love him for his brilliant Vulcan mind , but really . We come , we give pain and delight ! Brain and brain , what is brain ? Who needs it , anyway ?

I 've always said that one of the things I liked about Kirk was that no woman was ever completely undesirable to him - she could n't be too ugly , too scary , too smart , too brutish , too alien - and here we see one of several cases where he initiates a seduction for selfish reasons but ends up liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some nice visuals on the planet - Galt 's glowing eyes that activate the light-up collars of obedience , the spare , clean slave cells and the rocky terrain over which Shahna takes Kirk for an exercise run - and some gratuitous whipping and shirt-ripping , not to mention the shadow-play on the wall as Lars assaults his trainee while Kirk has one of his fine panicked ranting moments , " What 's ... happening ... toLieutenantUhura ?

" ( What does he think this is , Iraq ... er , Vietnam ? ) Kirk does n't intend to stick around to be certain that the teaching meets with his approval , and we do n't hear about Federation plans to check up on Triskelion ; instead we are left with the image of Shahna staring tearfully after Kirk , who has returned to the lights in the sky . <p> Though there are more of them , the scenes on the planet do n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Spock encounters his usual problems in command as McCoy and Scotty put forth what they believe to be sound arguments against his planned course of action .

When Scotty first reports Kirk 's disappearance , Spock says , " I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter , Mr. Scott , " and that kind of thick-headed Vulcan logic continues through the episode to very nice effect .

@@58304248 @7304248/ <h> Retro Review : Blood Fever <p> After a Vulcan engineer tries to force Torres to mate with him , the effects of pon farr impair her judgment during a dangerous away mission . <p> Plot Summary : Voyager has discovered a planet with deposits of gallicite , which the ship urgently needs to refit its warp coils . The crew finds evidence that a civilization once colonized the planet , but they appear to be long gone . While Torres tries to prepare for an away mission to retrieve the gallicite , Lieutenant Vorik astonishes her by asking her to marry him , citing the ways in which they complement each other . When she refuses , he seizes her and initiates a mind-meld which she ends by punching him in the face . The EMH examines Vorik and concludes that he has the symptoms of pon farr , though both Vorik and Tuvok are reluctant to discuss anything as private as the Vulcan mating drive even with each other .

She suggests that they have sex , but Paris fears that shell regret it afterward because she 's not in her right mind , although he changes his mind when they are rescued and Tuvok insists that Paris must help Torres or she will die . Meanwhile , Vorik beams himself down to the planet and sabotages the ship to prevent anyone from following .

Voyager trades technology for the gallicite , only to discover that the underground aliens are so fearful because their colony was decimated by the Borg . <p> Analysis : I know a lot of people love this episode . Its the first time Paris and Torres admit that they have feelings for each other the real beginning of their canonical relationship . Its the start of the Borg arc that will shape Janeway and Chakotays characters for the rest of the series . It gives us a Vulcan connection with the original series . We get to see the Doctor bragging about his comprehensive knowledge of sexual behavior , characters in tight climbing gear , hand-to-hand Klingon-Vulcan combat , a whole bunch of scenes set somewhere other than on the ship .

I might even hate " Blood Fever " as much as I hate " Retrospect " the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telling anyone about it . I will never get past the fact that " Blood Fever " is the episode which makes clear that Starfleet not only pardons but tries to aid sexual predators if they use the excuse that they just could n't help themselves . Its the episode in which a crewmember sexually assaults his superior officer and the head of security refuses to do anything about it even to protect her from a second assault because the inability to control ones violent sexual impulses is considered too much of a personal matter . Its the episode in which ( I cant believe I have to type this sentence ) Tuvok orders Paris to have sex with Torres after Paris has repeatedly expressed that he does n't  want to have sex , not like this , not under these circumstances . Imagine if Kirk had demanded Uhura help Spock in " Amok Time " even as Uhura was saying that , while she really liked Spock , she did not want to have sex with him . Or imagine that Spock had assaulted Uhura the way Vorik assaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-Klingon probably would n't be able to fight off a Vulcan . Its vile . The only reason Vorik is n't a rapist is because , as he declares in his proposal , he has chosen the strongest woman on the ship , someone whose biology suggests that she likes brutal sex . Torres may manage to avoid physical violation by Vorik , but she 's still a victim of sexual violence . And even if no touching had happened in this episode , there 's so much hideous rhetoric about sex in " Blood Fever " that its hard to watch . <p> Voriks " proposal " is itself a demonstration of male entitlement . Vorik comes to Torres with a shorter list of things he can offer her as a mate than the list of things he imagines she can provide for him . The Doctor has n't  yet confirmed that he s experiencing pon farr , so Vorik believes his behavior to be logical and justified . He gives two seconds of lip service to her talents and bravery before he starts bullying her , first with a 20th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surely fears the likelihood that none of the other limited choices aboard would pick her , then with the brag that he s the only man around who can handle a woman like her because of his Vulcan prowess . ( Its rare for me to cheer when someone solves a problem by punching someone else , but I whooped aloud when she smashed his face . ) The escalation from declarations of desire to demands for reciprocation and violence upon rejection may be scripted here as typical for Vulcans , based on original series precedent , but its also far too typical an experience for human women in the presence of men whove been told that persistence and aggression are the keys to winning over a partner and that sex is owed to a man who follows what he believes to be the nominal rules of courtship . Voriks response to Torress refusal is to try to take what he wants . " I meant to be gentle , but she tried to move away , " he tells Tuvok as if Torres and not Vorik is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be logical for Torres to mate with Vorik once its obvious that the assault has given her pon farr symptoms , though Tuvok notes that Torres has never been logical , which we know to be a Vulcan insult . Janeway goes along with Tuvok and the Doctor in accepting Voriks right to work out his problem on his own as is Vulcan custom , but it does n't  seem to occur to any of them that Vorik may very well attack Torres again or choose a woman less equipped to fight him off . If the Doctor believes that Vorik can transfer his affections to a holographic sex doll and forget about Torres , surely he must recognize the possibility that Vorik might choose another live , independent female as a mate . Yet Vorik is treated as a sympathetic victim rather than as a threat to every woman on the ship . Does n't  Chakotay , who was deceived and essentially raped by Seska , have anything to say ? <p> I 'm trying to put aside both my incredulity that Starfleet would protect Vulcan privacy by putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentient hologram would create a sex-slave hologram . Its not like the latter is a new idea on Star Trek , though I 'd think the EMH of all people would be slightly more concerned with the way holograms can be programmed to submit to anything even when theyve also been given intelligence . For the mind meld aspect of pon farr to be relieved , would n't she have to have a sophisticated mind ? I understand that Vorik is n't equipped to undertake the full kal-if-fee ritual we witnessed during " Amok Time " and Torres probably has even less experience with Klingon bonding rituals than Worf did when he and KEhleyr hurled themselves at one another , but substituting a few minutes of violent combat for a mating bond is ridiculous given that we 've been told the violence of Klingon and Vulcan mating rituals exists specifically because there 's so much more to sex than mindless rutting . The Vulcan bond is meant to be much more than physical . Here , violence and sex are interchangeable releases of tension . I 'm not sure why the Doctor thinks a hologram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Klingon mating behaviors , as uncomfortable as I am with the fact that Dax and Worf often end up in the infirmary afterward , they 're supposed to be consensual . In " Blood Fever " we have Torres biting Paris as mindlessly as Vorik tries to force a meld on her , then repeatedly trying to overrule Pariss objections to sex with her when she is n't in control of herself . The fact that Paris never feels threatened the way Torres evidently does with Vorik does not make the behavior less troubling . We 've often seen that Paris does n't  take sex overly seriously , and since he s basically a good guy , I imagine he might engage in it to save anyones life , even Voriks . But how ironic that the guy who 's most often been seen pursuing women attached to other men , treating twin sisters as if they 're interchangeable , and indulging himself with holographic women becomes the one serving as a role model in not taking advantage of woman whose judgment is impaired . There 's not much joy when he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may feel violated anyway and consider him the instrument if not the cause . <p> If " Blood Fever " has a saving grace , its this discovery about Paris , who suddenly seems more enlightened about sexuality than Tuvok , the Doctor , and Janeway , whose main role during this episode is to play the chaste leader and make uncomfortable faces while her EMH gleefully reads off lists of mating behaviors across the galaxy . Remind me again about how it would be wrong for her and Chakotay to have an entirely consensual relationship , but its okay for Vulcan officers to go on deep space missions where they may rape crewmates or die trying . Paris has made comments previously about being sorry he missed seeing inappropriate shipboard fraternization and thinking Kim should ignore fidelity in favor of snagging a Delaney sister before they 're taken , but his understanding of and insistence upon consent is one of the sexiest things ever to appear on Voyager .

Tucker , who had plans to meet her for a neuropressure session , forces T'Pol 's door open when she does n't answer and is hit over the heat by Rajiin when kneels by T'Pol , unconscious on the floor .

Phlox discovers that the reptilian Xindi apparently had a suicide gland implanted in his body to release a neurotoxin . Archer demands a complete autopsy and a complete analysis of the alien weapon , including possible counter-measures . Back at the Xindi council , the humanoids and reptilians quarrel about the risk of rushing into an assault . Rajiin shows them data on human biology but tries to explain that there is more to the humans than they will learn from scans .

" I 'm not sure that there could be such a thing as a responsible Trek episode about sexual slavery , but this sure as hell was not it , anyway . <p> Or wait ... that 's not exactly true about responsible episodes . This is , incredibly , the same series that gave us " Cogenitor " , which is a very serious look at sexual slavery not a fantasy of beautiful , well-dressed women in exotic brothels . The irony is that despite their cheap , sleazy seductive moves , none of the alien women is as erotic nor as interesting as , say , Vina in the original series ' " Menagerie " , because voyeuristic desire depends on more than just flashes of erotic poses . We have to have some connection to the scene , some sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refocused on the violence of Rajiin 's rescue ; the payoff tussle is premature . T'Pol and Tucker , who are much less specifically erotic with one another even compared to last week 's episode , are a lot sexier to watch , particularly since we get to see them interacting on so many levels quarrelling , working together , trying to protect one another and trying to keep their relationship from being perceived as precisely the sort of sleazy sexual hookup being sold in the bazaar . <p> Rajiin is in some ways a fascinating character , a combination of little-girl-lost and woman-before-her-time , not weak despite her need for rescue , not a bimbo despite her use of her charms in the practice of her career , whether it 's spying , prostitution or both . We do n't really know whether she 's getting paid for her efforts or if she might have a gland like the one in the reptilian Xindi that might trigger her death if she did not cooperate ; we do n't know yet whether the Xindi killed himself or if , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . From that standpoint Rajiin remains intriguing and somewhat sympathetic . <p> In other ways she 's an absolute clichT a trained slut who comes on to everyone around her . ( I wo n't ask who on Enterprise loaned or replicated her clothes . ) The scene where she gets touchy-feely with Sato feels spectacularly gratuitous , even more so than the scene where she gets her hands all over T'Pol 's naked flesh , because at least by the time she touches T'Pol we have some idea what she 's up to ; when she 's with Hoshi it looks like pure lesbian titillation for the boys in the audience who are into watching that sort of thing , and rather than preserving her personal space , Hoshi seems prepared to dive in . Do n't get me wrong , I 'd be delighted to learn that Hoshi was lesbian or bisexual , but that 's not what this is about , any more than T'Pol 's heavy breathing and writhing when Rajiin touches her is about forbidden Vulcan loss of control . It 's about creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that my sons are too young for this show and I 'd be better off sending them down the basement to watch Smallville on Wednesdays from now on . It 's also clear that any male over 18 ( or at least with emotional maturity over 18 ) is n't going to find these cheap sexual tactics a good enough reason to watch the show ; it 's not like throngs of men tuned into Voyager to see Seven 's catsuit . So who is this show aimed towards : males 14-16 , the only ones old enough to be allowed to watch this nonsense yet young enough to find it titillating ? That does n't really seem like enough of an audience base to keep this franchise alive . I 'm going to be very interested in the ratings this month , to see how many viewers in that demographic instead tune in to see an adolescent Superman who never gets laid . <p> And it 's a shame that this is what I 'll remember about " Rajiin " , because in other aspects it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are references to the events of every episode so far this season , a B-plot picking up on the need for Trellium-D to resist the effects of the anomalies , Archer still suffering from having been completely transformed not long ago ( and how rare is that on Trek , to see a character having major issues from genetic rewiring we sure did n't get it in Voyager 's " Threshold " ! ) , Tucker and T'Pol having to struggle with the implications of what they are and are not doing together in her quarters after-hours . <p> I 'm unfortunately distracted by the glaring inconsistency of Archer 's sweet treatment of Rajiin in the brig ... following his behavior a few weeks back , when , as I 'm sure we all remember , he put an alien in an airlock and threatened to kill him . That alien was an incidental captive , a marauder who did n't necessarily have information about the Xindi ; Rajiin , however , has already proven herself to be a liar and a conspirator . Not that I 'm in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if Archer did it once , why did n't he do it again ? Because she 's hot , because she 's a she ? It 's very convenient considering that she ends up trying to defend him to the Xindi , who do n't listen anyway , but there 's never any rationale for it . There 's no rationale , either , for what could be taken as a violation of non-interference when Archer rescues Rajiin after all the grief he gave Tucker in " Cogenitor " for getting involved , but since there 's no Prime Directive , that , at least , can be ignored . <p> As arc storytelling goes , " Rajiin " takes some interesting risks and keeps all the pieces of the puzzle nicely in play . As science fiction goes , though , it 's pretty feeble , despite lovely alien bazaar sets and a glimpse of a Jeffries tube . I wo n't even ask the obvious question of why , if the Xindi plan to destroy humanity using data from her scans , Rajiin wastes so much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to fantasize that the traces of alien viral DNA in Archer 's and Sato 's bodies will have mucked up those scans , and hope the non-humans on the " Jedi Council " acquire more depth , and wait to see if the Expanse holds any truly strange new worlds , new life or new civilizations .

" Originally , they were going to open the torpedo in orbit , in space , so originally we had Kirk chasing her into a room where she was changing into a space suit , " said Orci .

And that vision is tested by Khan , and it is corrupted by Marcus , within itself . And so the question Kirk asks at the end of the movie , and I think the question we leave the movie on is , can Starfleet continue in its utopian vision given the kind of things that happen in the movie ?

So it was really nice to see how she could be so professional on stage and off ( during the autograph line ) and be so nice , attentive and listening to the audience because that was what she did back in 1996 . She has obviously not forgotten who has been her bread and butter these past seven years during Voyager 's run as unfortunately many of the TNG and DS9 stars have . <p> What also made this convention appearance of hers interesting was almost half - and I mean half - the people asking questions at the mic were really people who were giving Kate heart-wrenching , personal testimonials on how Kate herself and/or the Janeway character had changed them in some dramatic way ; in some cases saved their lives from suicide or other devastating things . So I would have more quotes and facts in this review , except half the conversations going on with Kate with the audience members at the mic were personal testimonials which Kate listened to patiently , hugged each person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk was over . Having been going to conventions since 1980 , never since Lucy Lawless ( Xena ) in 1997 had I *ever* seen a guest star get so much adulation and personal testimonials of life affirmations . It was pretty incredible to witness , although I think there people who might have wanted to ask Kate some more questions . <p> This being Kate 's hometown now , her husband , Tim Hagen , was present , looking ever the politician . He is a major political figure in Cleveland and Ohio in general and it has been rumored for some time that he may run for Governor . Hagan 's appearance there did reek a bit of politics , standing by Kate on stage through the last part of her talk , although he did get fun comments like being called ' Mr. Mulgrew ' ( which I personally called him in the autograph line - as he was sitting beside her the whole time ) . It brought an aspect of the ' real world ' of politics into a place I did n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities were now to follow Hagan and his plans because he had had to follow her career and her plans the last few years they had been married . <p> Toward the end of Kate 's talk , while Hagan was on stage , he was asked by a fan what it was like to be married to ' such a strong-willed woman ? ' His response was to suddenly drop to his knees on stage and bow down three times to her in supplication - got great laughs from the audience . He said he 'd been in Cleveland politics for years and was rather well known in the area . But now he was known as ' Captain Janeway 's husband . ' Kate laughed in response and called him ' Mr. Mulgrew ' and everyone laughed heartily . <p> Perhaps Hagan 's presence and that of her mother-in-law ( also on stage ) and perhaps other family members present led to Kate being ' on ' so much of her talk . But it did n't matter - she was simply terrific on stage - looked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ask for , especially considering the convention outrageous prices that were being charged by Make It So Productions . <p> Kate started her talk by addressing the native Cleveland residents and how wonderful it was just a few days ago to be sitting at home with her husband and stepdaughters and watching the end of Voyager ' Endgame . ' She talked about how she cooked a big meal for everyone , sat down and started to cry and just could n't stop every time one of her cast mates came on screen . " It was a very brutal finish to something that has meant a great deal . " She said when she went to bed that night she slept right into the next day and in the end was " proud , deeply proud " of what she had been a part of . She felt that since day one on the set of Voyager she had " set a high bar for Janeway and kept that bar to the end . " She felt she was able to " flesh out the skeleton for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion " and so on . <p> Towards the beginning of her talk , Kate addressed all the women in the audience and thanked them " for your unfailing support over the years . That without that support , Janeway would never have been able to be what she was . " She said women were the constant source of love , comfort and joy in life and without that she would n't have been able to do the part . She then addressed the men in the audience : " How could you trust me to run the ship ? " She then thanked the fathers in the audience for letting their sons watch the show . <p> What was her favorite line of the series ? " Engage . " She said that in " Caretaker " , brought in after former Janeway actress Genevieve Bujold has given up the part . Kate said " there were 20 suits on the set and director Rick Kolbe pulled me aside and said , ' this is your room , do it your way , Babe . ' " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " great moment . " <p> Did Bujold ever call her up and say , " Hey - doing a great job " , etc. ? No , but Kate said that she had nothing but admiration for Bujold for turning down the part because she realized early on that " Trek was n't for her ... I am SO glad she left ! " Kate said she wondered what would have happened had Bujold STAYED for 4-6 months and THEN left ... it would have been a disaster for the show . It was good that she realized the situation and left when she did . Kate mentioned that one of Bujold 's priorities at the time was brining up a young son , and that was the choice that she chose to make instead of doing Voyager . <p> Kate talked about how , when she was first hired to do Voyager , she was sent 10 videotapes of Trek to study . She had two days to prepare for the role before she had to go before the cameras and she did n't want to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was glad I went with my gut . " <p> Did Kate see Janeway running Voyager as a democracy or a dictatorship ? " I did n't rule by dictatorship , but from the high of femininity . " <p> TV Guide left her out of the list of " Sexiest Women in Sci-Fi . " Where was Kate ? " I was working , " she laughed . <p> Kate was asked if she would do a Voyager movie ? " I have learned to never say die . " She feels a movie would be speculation only but would seriously consider it if it were to become a reality . <p> Toward the final filming of ' Endgame , ' her work hours often went to 85-hours per week because of the constant filming of double Janeways . She said every shot with the two Janeways ( Admiral and Captain ) had to be done three times : one shot delivering the lines , one with the double , and one with no one there . They tried to do interesting things like the Captain passing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took 10 hours to film . " She said the measurements of the people and objects had to exact . <p> She was asked yet again - at every convention appearance , just like Robert Beltran- about the whole Janeway/Chakotay relationship and why could n't they have finally gotten together in the end . Kate said that she simply felt it was n't a good idea for her , at the age of 38 , still of child-bearing years to be in a relationship with her first officer . She felt romance would be better - which she had with a hologram . " I needed a First Officer I could count on and that he would n't be thinking of something else . " Shortly after this question , a man dressed in a command Voyager uniform and tight leather pants came up to the mic and Kate joked - as she had him come up on stage - that perhaps if Chakotay had worn this outfit every day than maybe things would have been different ( everyone laughed ) . <p> After series creator and Executive Producer Jeri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined for the Janeway character ? Kate said that Taylor " wrote the blueprint for Janeway but that I threw that out and rewrote it . " When Taylor left Kate said she simply took off with the part with Taylor gone . <p> One question from a fan involved the original Star Trek series and how it was able to comment on the Vietnam War and other social issues of the 1960 's . Did Kate think that Voyager had done the same in its time period ? Kate said , yes , she felt Voyager tackled many issues of the day including suicide , the Vidians problem and the episodes dealing with the Prime Directive . " I felt every topic was topical and on the mark ... I feel Voyager attacked with fervor and resolution many current issues of the day . " <p> Kate said she found it " daunting " to be considered someone who was helping bring people into the 21st century in terms of science and technology . She knew from the beginning when she learned how Trek affected science . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she like best ? Kate said that actually she had no favorite hair style of the many she wore . " They drove me crazy with it . Patrick Stewart had it easy . " She commented in hindsight how the suits were SO nervous about a woman in charge that they applied themselves to a symbol - her hair - and that would decide whether she would succeed or not . <p> About make-up on set : Kate said she did n't like people touching her all the time , " It was annoying . " At this point husband Hagan came on stage and talked about how the make-up people drove HIM nuts because they would shoot 10 seconds of one scene and suddenly the make-up people would descend on Kate again and again , with touch-ups having to be done constantly . <p> Why did n't Harry Kim ever get promoted ? " We waited until the 7th season finale - he got himself into a lot of trouble ! " <p> A child asked her what was it like fighting the Borg ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end ? She killed her ! " <p> One of the very last questions was about the fun moments on the set . " Especially after midnight with the boys . Most men between the ages of 10 and 80 after midnight turn into something their mothers would rather they did n't . " With her often being the only woman there they would often overlook her ; but there were spit-ball fights , people dropping their pants to moon others - weird behavior . <p> What are her future plans ? Kate said that she will not give up acting and does plan to do some theater , but right now her husband comes first in everything . " I feel I 've been given a good thing with Tim . " <p> She felt one negative aspect of her Trek experience was how her sons over the last seven years had mostly seen her " in the Captain 's chair " and not at home . <p> During the early part of her talk , Kate pointed off stage to her husband , " The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " She talked about how over that time he had been visiting the set of Voyager every 10 days , getting up at 4am with her and standing with her on the set for 15-16 hour days . She felt she owed him a lot . <p> " There was a rumor that I married into a small family ... that 's a gross understatement . " She said she married into a HUGE family where Hagan is the Patriarch . <p> Who has influenced her the most ? Her acting teacher Stella Adler as well as her mother who told her she " would be a great actress . " She credited those two as her biggest role models . <p> Kate loves coffee . She laughed about the people in the room who had turned into coffee addicts because of the Janeway character . <p> ' Kiernan ' is her middle name - it 's her mother 's maiden name . <p> What made her go into acting ? Growing up in the cornfields of Iowa and being one of eight children . She was encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar at the age of 14 to subsidize apprenticeships to prepare for leaving home at the age of 16 . " Acting was all I ever wanted . It has been my salvation . Stella Adler said it would be the one thing that would always lift me up - how true . " <p> 25 years ago , where did she think she would be ? ( in acting , in life ) . " I did n't think I 'd be here , certainly . " She said Voyager showed how fate and serendipity were involved . " I never imagined being Captain of a ship - and a damned good place to be . " <p> Does Kate feel there has been a prejudice against her because of her voice ? She said she feels it has worked in her favor because it has an " original quality .... and no bimbo roles for me . " <p> Hagan was asked that if he became Governor of Ohio , would he vote for more money for NASA ? " What the Hell do you think my answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . At one point during her talk , Kate struck the famous Janeway hands-on-the-hips pose for everyone - and it brought the house down ! Very popular with everyone . <p> At the same convention , Roxann Dawson was asked if there were any props or any part of Voyager she took home as a souvenir . In the autograph line for Kate , someone asked her the same question and Kate replied with a big smile that she took home a uniform " pips , the boots - the whole thing . " <p> Guest Roxann Dawson was in fabulous form during her Saturday appearance , wearing a blue , sleeveless dress and rather short hair . She was funny , witty and delightful and proudly proclaimed to everyone when she got on stage that this was her very first convention after the ending of the series had aired ( just the week before ) and this was the first time she was at a convention without a script in her room to study . <p> Right off the bat she asked the fans in the audience if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much applause . " I thought it was a very classy ending . " She wondered whether the ship just heading to Earth was the real way to end it . Would it have been better to see more , such as Janeway facing a Court Martial for breaking Starfleet rules , 7of9 going off to jail , Paris becoming a father ... <p> Roxann is always a GREAT source of information for Trek so this review is filled with tons of it . It even includes a few snippets on the new Trek series Enterprise in which she is directing an episode . <p> Before anyone had a chance to ask she answered the usual question about the make-up : It took 2 1/2 hours for the Klingon make-up to go on and an hour to take it off . " Ethan was three hours of make-up - would you believe that ? ? " <p> She watched the series Finale with her 3-year-old kid and the kid saw her mommy ( B'Elanna having a baby ) and her kid looked at her and asked , " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said her kid did n't like that at all . Roxann also explained that when she was pregnant three years ago she asked the writers to include an eating disorder for Torres - seeing B'Elanna eating food constantly in Engineering , " but they did n't go with that . Then when they make me pregnant they had to put all this padding " on her . She commented how , when she was really pregnant during 4th season , they hid her pregnancy by having her wear an Engineering " smock " that had the tools actually SEWN INTO the jacket and could not be removed . <p> She commented that the padding during the latter part of 7th season became quite extensive and quite uncomfortable . She was wearing a wool uniform , rubber on her face and boots and it was all uncomfortable , " But I was supposed to be pregnant so it made sense . " <p> She said it was strange that the series , as a whole , was over - it was a seven year commitment , " which was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " She feels overall there will be no continuation of the show , that the writers knew what they were doing at the end of the episode . She has heard no plans for a TV movie of any kind . She said that after seven years it was sort of good to have it over , feeling it was time to graduate , like school , and looks forward to the future . She does n't regret the seven years but does feel it is time to move on . <p> The most poignant episode of 7th season was when Ethan Phillips ( Neelix ) left . " Because it was the last scene the whole cast would be together before the end of the show . " <p> The very day of filming for the show was her and Robert Picardo ( the Holodoc ) doing the Be'Elanna-gives-birth scene . <p> How did it feel as the series was coming to a close ? She said she has so many strange feelings going on , especially when the sets started being taken apart - it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she stole a piece of the Engineering set ; she tried to steal to the Warpcore , " But it was too big to fit in my purse . " She said Robert Picardo stole the wooden railing around the Warpcore and put it around the bar at his house . She thought it was neat to have part of the set . <p> Roxann was asked what it was like to be called " B'Elanna " in public by the fans ? " If they look nice than I say ' Hi . ' If they look weird than I ignore them . " She said she feels the Klingon make-up has been good to hide her real appearance and help her get other work and not get typecast . <p> About the first season episode ' Faces , ' " When I hardly knew my character . " She asked her parents to watch this particular episode and her mother calls her afterward and tells her she was good . Roxann said she was disappointed because she put so much hard work into both roles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the episode again and her mother comments that woman who played the Klingon female was terrific - not knowing it was Roxann all along ( much laughter from the audience ) . <p> Speaking of first season , she said in the beginning when the cast had been hired for the show , they were all given a tour of the various sets like the Bridge , Sickbay , etc . When they got to Engineering , director Rick Kolbe turned to Roxann and said , " And this two-level set is yours and you 'll be shoveling coal over there . " Roxann said she went home to her husband saying she 'd shoveling coal in the show ! <p> In terms of how she got the part , she said her agent called her and said that Paramount was doing a new Star Trek series and it was shooting in Los Angeles - which was good for her because it was local , " And I wanted to work locally . " She went in for some readings but did n't hearing anything for three months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Trek to see what it 's all about since she did n't have a clue . She watches some TNG , sees Worf 's character and goes , " Oh , that poor man , " and all the make-up . Finally she is told she has the part - hr agent having been told , " No , there would be minimal make-up . " The early tests for her make-up " were horrendous . It was all very heavy and I would come home crying it was so awful . " She had her parents over for dinner and showed them a picture of what she would look like and , " He just laughed and laughed . " Months later he came to her asking for promotional shots and about how he needs autographs for a few friends . <p> She directed the episodes ' Riddles ' and ' Workforce , Part II and will now be directing the second episode of the new Star Trek series Enterprise . " Voyager has ended for me , but my association with Star Trek continues . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " No , because as an actor you do all sorts of things and this is just one of those things . " <p> She was asked about her action figure and commented about how she and Ethan Phillips joke that the plastic figures look nothing like them . <p> Roxann was asked what it was like working with such an excellent actress as Kate Mulgrew . She felt that Kate " held the standard we tried to hold up to . She was a real team player and a cohesive force . " <p> Would she participate in a Voyager movie ? " If B'Elanna has to wear make-up , probably not - just joking ! " She said she knew a new TNG movie was planned but did n't know if DS9 or Voyager would become movies . " Probably not . " <p> Was there ever a scene where she had to do a lot of takes ? Roxann laughed and went into this hysterical story about how it was first season and the director of the episode was TNG 's LeVar Burton ( Geordi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable with all the technobabble - she had problems with it in the beginning - but get better at as season progressed . Then Burton comes in to direct and suddenly there was line of technobabble that she simply could not do . Take after take and she could n't get it , " I was SO embarrassed . " Burton eventually walks her around the Engineering set and tells her that she can do it , it 'll come to her . Eventually she gets the line , but ever since then has never forgotten it , " Vent the conduits around the dorsal emitters . " She felt it was on of her most embarrassing moments on the set . <p> What are some memories from being with the cast ? Roxann said it was hard to choose , really , part of the problem being there so many times when she and Kate Mulgrew , " Would laugh so hard it would be awful . The boys would do Riverdance impressions and do impressions of people . " She said Tim Russ ( Tuvok ) once appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) , she said Robbie and Tim Russ would do stuff , " juvenile stuff . " Like Robbie would get a " big guber thing and stick it in his nose and wait for someone to say something . " She felt it was not that funny - just weird . Tim wanted to get a huge afro hair style with a bog book box and play the theme to " Shaft . " She described Ethan Phillips as " quite loony . " he would simply moon people all the time . Robert Beltran would do impressions of people as did Garrett Wang . " The girls were entertained but the boys were who would entertain . " Meanwhile , with Garrett , on the Internet someone had put his head on the body of a body builder and she would take it to the set and show it off to people - so proud of it . She said recently on a Trek cruise he denied the whole thing but then posed for everyone ( with clothes on ) . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite 7th season episode was ' Lineage . ' " I was reading the script and kept breaking down and crying . I felt it was the strongest story , " and was meaningful for her . <p> An audience member mentioned that a recent PBS Nova episode covered the issue of genetics and showed a scene from the Voyager episode " Lineage " where B'Elanna wanted to change the genetics of her unborn child . Roxann was proud of that . <p> Was never a Star Trek fan before joining Voyager , " But I have SEEN THE LIGHT ! " <p> Roxann said it was weird that B'Elanna was in TV Guide as one of ScFi- 's sexist stars ... she felt it was B'Elanna , NOT HER , Roxann , in the issue . " Bt it was neat to have a woman with ridges was a sexy sci-fi woman . " <p> The name of B'Elanna 's &amp; Tom 's baby is Miral , named after Roxann 's mother . <p> Roxann described the Warpcore as swirling lights in a screen , " Sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ' angry ' on the show ? " It was SO much fun ! " She said in real life she can get very angry and frustrated and has been known to use dishes and throw them in a garage so as not to break other , more valuable things . <p> If Torres has not been romantically involved with Tom Paris , who would she have wanted Torres to be hooked up with ? " Janeway ! " she laughed . <p> How did she about Kes leaving after 3rd season ? Roxann explained that she had just become pregnant and had been written out of a lot of scripts . She just was n't present for a lot of stuff with Kes . But " I feel it was a good cast before ( Jennifer Lien left ) and a good cast afterward ... we had a lot of fun all around . " &gt;p&gt;She is directing the second episode of the first season of Enterprise . She said she actually had a script upstairs in her room for the episode , " Bt I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set and thinks Scott Bakula is a great choice for Captain and it looks like a strong cast . She says there 's a lot going on in the opening pilot . <p> With the directing of the Enterprise episode and the like , she feels a lor of her future will involve directing in general . <p> Regarding other work , she has been recently involved in the " Alien Voices " audio series headed by Leonard Nimoy and John DeLancie . She said things seemed to have fallen apart over a few things but hopes to do more . <p> She is continuing to work on the 3-book Simon &amp; Schuster book series . Called the Tenebria Trilogy , she 's working with a writer . The only guidelines given by Simon &amp; Schuster were that there be a strong female character and that the story be in the science fiction genre . The first book has already been released in paperback after an initial 750 hardback release . The second book is coming out soon with the same charity release of 750 hard backs and will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has written mostly in play form , not novel form and it has been quite interesting for her . <p> One of her upcoming projects is to be in Austin , Yexas the first weekend of September to do some workshops as well as put on a play that she wrote . <p> Roxann said her first professional job our of college was doing two years of " A Chorus Line . " She has done two very long runs of shows now in her life ( she indicated she wound up doing " A Chorus Line " a lot longer than two years ) . <p> Her life has changed quite dramatically since Voyager ended . She talked about how she has more time with her children and how they love having her at home . She used to have to get up at 3:30am every morning to be at work by 4:15am for make-up . Now she has time to take her kids to swimming lessons and plant a garden . " I am enjoying the time . " <p> Her education involved UCLA Berkley , some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor , Larry Moss . She said that for big B'Elana episodes she would often go to him for advice . She said in general actord should be constantly training even while acting . <p> What does she think she 'll be doing in the next five years or so ? " I am someone who does n't know what bored means . " She said she had the trilogy of books she was working on , hoping it would turn into a screenplay . She wants to spend more time with her children , and get to know her husband again . " There are so many things , from traveling to writing ... I just want to embrace life . " <p> A 6-year-old fan in the audience asked what it was like to have a baby . Roxann 's response , " VERY PAINFUL ! " <p> At the end of her talk she auctioned off a signed picture of Jeri Ryan , Kate Mulgrew and herself in the famous " evening gown " picture . It was for a charity for children in an AIDS camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation where it helps female children in China - where girls in China are nit valued as much as boys and are mistreated and this helps girls , among other things , find homes out of their native China . <p> What can one say about Jennifer Lien other than - at least she has improved as a convention guest over the past few years . Before coming to this convention I had been warned by many people that Lien as a guest was a disaster . That she answers very little when people ask questions . That she has no opinions on anything , has no sense of humor and has often had her on stage time cut sometime by half because there have been so few questions for her because , well , she really did n't answer questions with more than a yes or no . She has been widely considered the worst of the Trek convention guests . <p> But I tried to go into this with an open mind and see for myself just how bad she could be , and what I saw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one syllable and actually have a sense of humor . My impression is that she had simply learned over her convention appearances to deliver more than mono-syllable answers . Anyway , something had changed and it was for the better . She was much more animated than had been reported before and was more forward spoken . <p> She was introduced by fellow convention guest Roxann Dawson . She wore a yellow sweater with a shawl over a long black dress . Her hair was wild and curly . She was on stage for less than half an hour . <p> A child asked what it was like to be thrown off the show ? " As an actor you have to realize that it happens . You take your knocks and keep going . " Had she been able to pick the Holographic Doctor 's name , what would she have named him ? Lien responded that she really knew the HoloDoc as " Zimmerman or Schweitzer . He picked Joe ? ? " <p> In the episode ' Tuvix ' how would she have ended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way . " <p> If she were offered to work on a new Trek as a different character , would she do it ? Lien said she did n't really know - she had no idea if she would be doing any more acting at all . <p> She welcomed the character in the episode ' Warlord . ' " I liked that different play on the character . " <p> Lien was asked about her current curly hair and was that what was used toward the end of 3rd season ? She said her hair was naturally curly , but that a wig was used on the show . Sometimes the wig allowed her to get away without wearing the pointed ears . <p> Was anything the same when she returned for the 6th season episode ' Fury ? ' Lien said that everyone was very nice and people seemed really relaxed in their roles . She enjoyed doing ' Fury , ' " I felt it was interesting character change . " ' Fury ' was her favorite episode of all of Voyager , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " <p> Was there a particular favorite actor on Voyager that she liked working with ? " It would be unfair to answer that . " <p> Are there any jokes or funny moment that she remembers from the set ? " Well my wig once caught on fire - no , just kidding . But it could have happened . " <p> How much of Jennifer was Kes and visa versa ? She said it was a fine balance between her and the character . " It was my body and my voice that made Kes , but things were done to change that . " <p> Was she ever prepared for the instant fame that Trek gave her ? " I do n't think of myself as famous , but it is overwhelming . Any attention for what you do is overwhelming . " <p> When she read the script for the audition what was her impression of the character ? Lien said " Righteous , but not too self-righteous . I wanted that important distinction . " She wanted someone who had a limited lifespan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of naivety and other things for the character . I thought it was neat being an alien . " <p> Was playing an alien making her bring more to the role than just acting ? " No , I knew the writers would take care of that with the writing of the stories and characters . " <p> There was a reception for the convention guests last night and she said she saw Kate Mulgrew and Roxann Dawson there , it had been a long time since she had seen them . <p> What has she been doing lately with her time ? Lien said she had dropped out of acting for awhile and had been taking some classes and is just continuing to do that . She said right now she is exploring everything . " Getting two years out of the way " and then maybe specialize in something else . " Very general . " <p> Lien was complimented on her voice and the various voiceover work she has done over the years . She said she had done work for " Men in Black " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . On the Superman cartoon voiceover work , that was just a small role and something her agent had set her up to do . Does she prefer voice acting to stage ? No . <p> She recently worked on an American history film and enjoyed it , " It was a good project . " She has recently done an independent film but is still looking for a distributor for it . Did Lien ever appear in a film named " Hoofey " ? No , she was not in it . <p> She is from Iowa but is originally Norwegian . Poetry and fiction are her favorite things to read , as well as some science fiction . She could n't pin down any exact favorites . However she did say that so far she had read none of the Star Trek novels out there . <p> Does she prefer roles in comedy or drama ? " Both are good , both are roles , characters ... it 's really hard to choose . " <p> Does she have a website ? No , but Lien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Are there any particular acting parts that she enjoys doing more than others . She said she simply liked doing any role . What was her acting/training background ? Lien said she started acting 14 years ago in theater and did that for four years and also did some tape and video work . She then did some soap opera work , took some acting classes , some workshops and then came to California . While working on " Phenom " she studied more to improve her skills . Just recently she took an acting class that encompassed much of what she had learned over the years . She may not have been acting lately , but she has been practicing the talent .

@@58304267 @7304267/ <h> A Story Of Two Men <p> By Fred ShedianPosted at April 8 , 2001 - 2:54 AM GMT <p> In a change of pace , I would like to take a few minutes to tell a story which does n't seem to have too much to do with Star Trek . However , as the expression goes , never judge a Ferengi by it 's ears ... or something like that . This is a story about two men and how destiny caused them to meet . It is a story that raises several important points for us about determination and what we think about who will impact our world . Oh , did I forget to mention these are true stories ? So let us begin ... <p> The story begins in World War II , the Pacific campaign actually . It centers on a Texan lawyer turned pilot who held a position within the United States Army Air Corps. who flew B-17s in an attempt to help his country defeat Japan . Becoming very close friends with a man named Kim , this First Lieutenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavalry Officer , would in the end find himself working in Washington D.C. and for Pan American airways . <p> This pilot had ended his military career with close to ninety combat engagements ... only to find himself aboard a crashing airliner almost five years after the war . After a crash which killed seventy-five percent of the passengers , the person who had orchestrated a successful rescue of the seven surviving passengers , decided he had enough with planes . He turned his attention back to law and became a police officer . Eventually moving to Los Angeles , he ended up on the " skid row " detail , working as a patrolman with police informants , narcotics users , drug dealers and of course prostitutes . <p> This cop eventually found himself the head of research within a section of the L.A.P.D. and became an expert on studies dealing with drug addiction . Officer 6089 would eventually retire from the force in the mid fifties , leaving behind a distinguished career in civil defense . <p> When we reach our second chapter , we move back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , in New York , a family was pleased with the birth of a new baby boy . This child would find himself enjoying things on Long Island and would eventually attain a Bachelor of Science degree in Speech from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the late sixties . <p> This New Yorker would relocate to California and take up the talent of writing , eventually becoming the Director of Dramatic Development for a television studio . Here this speech major was involved in several television hits and worked heavily on the ABC hit " MacGyver . " Finally , he reached the pinnacle of his career by becoming the Executive-Director of Dramatic Development . <p> Now a New Yorker and a Texan have very little in common , as most folks can tell you . In fact , the above forty year tale of these two individuals could be considered common for people who apply themselves . It is a tale showing how work , regardless of who you are , can get you almost anywhere . You see , these two individuals would meet and become partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allow me to clarify . <p> Looking at our World War II veteran , do you recall the brief mention of a best friend named Kim ? Although this person lost contact with his friend after the war , you probably already know him . For you see , this man 's full name was Kim Noonien Singh .... perhaps a distant relative of Kahn Noonien Singh or maybe the creator of Data , Doctor Noonien Soong ? And although he had a Buddhist wedding , our Texan lawyer turned pilot/policeman is indeed the founder of our beloved franchise .... Gene Roddenberry . <p> The person he was destined to become friends with is one of those who hold the future of this franchise in the palm of his hand today . For you see , this man was indeed at the pinnacle of his career in 1986 ... acting as the head of Dramatic Development at Paramount Pictures . However , all this would change with a fellow named Roddenberry approaching him in 1987 about creating some show called " Star Trek : The Next Generation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take control over the Star Trek franchise in 1991 . <p> Some may be asking why I wrote the above today . I did it to point out how two completely different people and backgrounds came together to play important roles in what we consider the Star Trek Franchise . In addition , I wrote this to remind everyone to watch out ... you see , that person you may be bullying at work or school may someday be responsible for determining what 's in Star Trek 15 ... even if today they are a janitor at a fast-food restaurant . <p> Some of the lessons Star Trek attempts to teach are basic ones , and sometimes are often overlooked . Treating each other with the respect we wish to be treated is nothing new ... going back to Biblical references . However , it is trait many of us often forget ... and it is one we need to put in practice today if we ever hope to have a 23rd or 24th Century like those we 've come to love over the last thirty-five years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter holiday .

@@58304277 @7304277/ <h> The Savage Curtain <p> Plot Summary : While taking readings on a planet that appears to be made entirely of solid rock , the Enterprise is scanned and then addressed by an entity that appears to be President Abraham Lincoln . When a skeptical crew beams the being aboard , he reads as human and behaves as Kirk expects Lincoln to behave , though his transporter readings register momentarily as a kind of molten mineral . Lincoln invites Kirk and Spock to the planet 's surface , and when they accept , lured by the mystery of an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suddenly appearing on a previously uninhabitable planet , they are greeted by the great Vulcan philosopher Surak . They also meet the rock entity Yarnek , who cuts off their communication with the Enterprise and announces that he requires Kirk and Spock along with Surak and Lincoln to represent Good in a classic battle of Good vs . Evil , with Evil represented by Genghis Khan , the tyrant Colonel Green , the murderous scientist Zora and legendary Klingon Kahless . If they refuse to play , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in the fighting , Kirk and Spock win and are allowed to return to the Enterprise . <p> Analysis : Somewhere buried deep in the insanity that is " The Savage Curtain " lies the germ of an interesting idea : What if you could meet your childhood hero , the person who most represented " good " to you , but when the two of you together faced a deadly situation , your hero 's instincts and actions went counter to everything you believed was necessary to triumph ? Unfortunately , that 's not the episode we 're given here . <p> It 's never really explained whether Lincoln and Surak are Kirk and Spock 's ideal representations of " good " , nor whether we are seeing their own particular expectations for how those characters would act as opposed to some magical projection of the " real " Lincoln and Surak . In the end Spock concludes that Lincoln and Surak behaved as Kirk and Spock would have expected them to behave , which adds a kind of interest to the fact that Kirk and Spock argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their adversaries . But if we 're seeing Kirk and Spock 's expectations for " good " , then I 'd think we 'd be seeing their expectations for " evil " as well , and while Spock might have put human tyrant Colonel Green on his personal list for ruthless misuse of logic , and Kirk might have perceived Kahless as a bloodthirsty savage because he founded the Klingon Empire , who picked Zora over Hitler or Stalin ... or , if they wanted a woman of mythologically evil proportions , Elizabeth Bathory or one of the Borgias ? <p> Nor is it ever clear why Yarnek cares about good and evil as defined by humans , for although Surak and Kahless are not in any part human , Yarnek announces that the people of his world , Excalbia , are watching for their first understanding of " Earthlings " as represented by these teams . Kirk rightly announces in the end of that of course good and evil look similar when given this sort of playing field , though it seems unfair of Yarnek , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sacrifice and Lincoln 's efforts to save him in the same category as Kahless and Green 's joint perfidy . There 's an " Arena " -like quality to the challenge , with the combatants forced to use locally available materials while the crew watches helplessly on a monitor , with an alien judge sympathetic to no one 's cause waiting to see whether anyone represents any sort of real threat to his ideology . But in " Arena " , there was a reason for the combat : the Gorn had destroyed a Federation outpost , which the Federation had unwittingly placed on a planet they did n't realize had already been colonized . In " The Savage Curtain " , the alien simply seems to get his kicks watching aliens representing absolutes try to kill each other . <p> Does Yarnek do this often ? What has he learned ? Does his " go in peace " to Kirk at the end mean that he will rethink this tactic of slapping labels on people and then forcing them to fight ? Everything about the episode is half-baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting elements to Star Trek 's mythology , most notably Surak , the father of Vulcan logic and peace . It 's also interesting that Lincoln , who was never a military man , is chosen as Kirk 's idealized figure for good ; as before in history , he is assassinated , and one must wonder whether Kirk 's fantasy of Lincoln as a pacifist makes him believe that will always happen . Kirk very much wants to believe that this Lincoln is real even while Scotty is ridiculing him , wondering whether Robert the Bruce is next , yet he lacks faith in Lincoln 's methods , while Spock appears to feel that he has no business challenging Surak . <p> An unforgettable scene in this episode is set on the Enterprise , when the dead president addresses Uhura as a " charming Negress " , then apologizes for the statement , saying , " In my time , some used that term as a description of property . " Uhura assures him that no offense is taken - " In our century , we 've learned not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his communications officer and sends her to give Lincoln a tour of the ship . While Lincoln surely does not mean the racial term in a derogatory way , he is still defining Uhura by her skin color ; he does n't say , " What a charming woman in the shortest skirt I have ever seen , " which it surely is , by the standards of his own century , and he becomes aware a moment later that his apology is as telling about his inherent prejudices as his initial exclamation . Presumably Yarnek does n't witness this exchange , but he could learn a lot more about human biases and the way they are overcome through communication than anything in the scenario he constructs down on the planet .

But when Picard sends down an away team to determine whether the crew might enjoy shore leave among them , Wesley Crusher accidentally breaks the law and is sentenced to the only punishment known to the Edo : death . While the away team argues the unfairness of subjecting a child to a law of which he was ignorant , Picard discovers a multidimensional vessel orbiting the planet . When the vessel probes Data , allowing him to discover its objections to the nearby colony , the crew also discovers that the vessel is worshipped as a god by the Edo . Though the crew is allowed to retrieve Wesley over the objections of the Edo , the alien vessel gives Picard a signal that it would like the human colony removed from the nearby planet , then fades out of the dimension it shares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two bad episodes in one ! The first is about a nanve , childlike pleasure planet where people make love all day and apparently do little else , unless they have the misfortune to be named mediators , in which case they must frown sternly and execute others for ridiculously trivial offenses . The second is about an interpretation of the Prime Directive so preposterous that one desperately longs for Captain Kirk to show up , save Wesley and give both Picard and the Edo one of his trademark lectures on truth , fairness and thinking for themselves . I vastly prefer the earlier minutes , when a grinning Riker returns from an initial contact to announce that there 's a planet full of nubile hot young people ripe for first contact . Despite weird readings off the starboard bow that everyone in the audience knows perfectly well mean trouble , Picard sends down a team to evaluate the planet 's appropriateness for shore leave , apparently including Wesley to make sure all the public lovemaking wo n't have too traumatic an effect on the youngsters . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistake of teaching the local kids Hacky Sack and causes an interstellar incident !

Apparently the Edo have as little time to commit crimes as they do to cultivate their own fields , etc. , since they 're busy making love all day . ( It 's extremely unclear whether child molestation is a crime among the Edo ; the woman who first embraces Wesley looks like she 's contemplating it . ) It 's hard to say which is the bigger guilty pleasure : watching all the terrible actors in blond wigs running around jiggling in their skin-tight shorts or watching Wesley making an idiot of himself and then , in a fit of nerdiness worthy of - well , Picard - announcing , " I 'm with Starfleet . We do n't lie , " thus confessing his guilt and sealing his fate . <p> Now , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that calls itself " God " , what does he do ? If you answered , " Destroy it ! " , you 'd be right in nearly every case ! " Where No Man Has Gone Before " , " The Apple " , " The Return of the Archons " , " Who Mourns For Adonais " , etc. are just lead-ins to Star Trek V : The Final Frontier where Kirk meets a being claiming to be the God and naturally kicks His butt . Picard , unfortunately , cowers and blathers , citing the Prime Directive as a possible excuse just to let the Edo execute Wesley and be done with it until Beverly drops every trace of professionalism and sobs in Sickbay . You 'd think that " God " initially warning the crew not to interfere with " his " children would be enough of a red flag to call off shore leave and get everyone off the planet , but no . <p> The Next Generation-era shows often tried to have it both ways with religion , unlike the original series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly indulgence . The Edo " God " is in some ways like the Bajoran Prophets , interfering on every level with their lives , yet because the culture welcomes it and is dependent upon it , Picard respects this arrangement rather than concluding Kirk-like that God must be exposed for the fraud He is . The Edo girl Rivan strongly resembles the worshippers of Vaal making offerings , yet Picard never questions her obedience nor suggests that she question it . And she does not question , though she knows her God is not all-powerful ; as she points out , Picard could just beam Wesley aboard his city in space and be gone . Too bad for Wesley that the captain is less afraid of the wrath of God than of violating the Prime Directive . Yet if beaming the innocent Rivan aboard the ship to face her God is n't a violation of the Prime Directive , why worry about the more clear-cut matter of saving a human child from execution ? <p> Not altogether unexpectedly , the Edo start worshipping the Enterprise crewmembers because they share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Picard refuses to play that card , though he does attempt to beam Wesley away . Which God at first prevents , but after a brief declaration by Riker that justice has never been as simple as a rule book , God changes his mind and the Starfleet officers are allowed to beam out . Huh ? Did God just want their attention to put in another protest about the colony on the nearby planet ? Or was God actually testing the Edo 's commitment to punishments they rarely have had to execute ? It does n't ever really make sense . And although Picard shows more respect for the idea of spirituality than Kirk ever did , his willingness in the name of the Prime Directive to obey this tyrannical God and a planet of bimbos is frankly rather embarrassing . <p> Best moment of the episode : Worf telling Riker that he does not date because human females are too fragile , and Riker - who has been checking out every Edo woman available , in part , it seems , to make Troi jealous - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a statement , Riker would think it was bragging .

@@58304290 @7304290/ <h> Star Trek Ratings History <p> By Greg FullerPosted at July 7 , 1999 - 5:00 AM GMT <p> Two events are predicted more often than any other in the world today : the end of the world and the end of Star Trek . This year , especially , prognosticators are predicting that both will come to pass with the start of the new millennium . I 'm going to put this bluntly : They 've never been right before , and they still are n't . <p> One of the most often-used pieces of evidence used to support the idea that Trek is on the way down is Trek 's current performance in the Nielsen ratings . This will be a slightly different take on Trek 's last 12 years on TV -- While Trek 's weekly viewership has dropped off , the falling ratings can be attributed to many things other than falling popularity , and going by the ratings , the franchise is still healthy . <p> First off , here 's a rundown of the approximate number of homes tuned into Trek every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes in the Nielsen system ) : <p> Fall 1987 - Spring 1988 : 8.55 Million <p> Fall 1988 - Spring 1989 : 9.14 Million <p> Fall 1989 - Spring 1990 : 9.77 Million <p> Fall 1990 - Spring 1991 : 10.58 Million <p> Fall 1991 - Spring 1992 : 11.50 Million <p> Fall 1992 - Spring 1993 : 10.83 Million <p> Fall 1993 - Spring 1994 : 9.78 Million <p> Fall 1994 - Spring 1995 : 7.05 Million <p> Fall 1995 - Spring 1996 : 6.42 Million <p> Fall 1996 - Spring 1997 : 5.03 Million <p> Fall 1997 - Spring 1998 : 4.53 Million <p> Fall 1998 - Spring 1999 : 4.00 Million <p> The data looks grim ; on some levels , it is . The fact of the matter is that Star Trek has been losing its audience since TNG 's glory days in its 4th and 5th seasons . However the reasons for the drop are far different than some represent them . Between 1987 and 1994 , TNG was airing as a mainstream sci-fi show with very little competition and very good national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyager and DS9 . <p> When TNG premiered in 1987 , it was the only first-run syndicated show on television , and one of very few sci-fi shows in general . At the time , there were 4 networks and a handful of cable channels . <p> As TNG flourished in an atmosphere without competition , it firmly rooted itself in a position that would cause it to grow -- TNG was actually replacing some networks ' prime-time lineup in places . <p> When TNG ended , this seven year downward spiral began , but not because Trek as a whole was getting worse or less-liked , but because each new show was starting in a crowded , competitive environment with many similar shows . As of June , there were 7 networks , dozens of first-run syndicated shows , and over a hundred cable and premium channels . Where TNG had to deal with maybe a dozen competitors , DS9 and Voyager contend with around 50 ( counting the premiums ) and a sci-fi market that 's close to being oversaturated . <p> Where TNG was able to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS9 and Voyager have grown up in an environment very different from the one TNG grew up in . DS9 had to fight for prime-time slots and Voyager was only seen by as many people as UPN could reach . With Trek 's quick fade from the spotlight after the end of TNG , Trek swiftly lost its casual viewership and mainstream support . The number of people viewing Trek has shrunk back to what one would expect from a wildly successful cult TV show . Yes , that number is smaller than it once was , but for what Star Trek is , it 's still doing quite well . <p> The Next Generation was basically a mainstream show that fully intended to be a mainstream show . Good mainstream shows get pretty high ratings as TNG did . DS9 was never a mainstream show and it never wanted to be one . Voyager has tried to be a mainstream success but simply ca n't ( through no fault of its own ) because UPN is such a failure as a network . <p> The Star Trek franchise may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Voyager have thrived even with the handicaps they have . Judging every Trek series against TNG is what is leading people to make grand claims that the Trek series is dying , but despite the fact that both are Trek shows , comparing TNG to DS9 or TNG to Voyager is like comparing Apples to Squash . TNG was born with a silver spoon in its mouth , DS9 and Voyager had to fight their way up . <p> Deep Space Nine spent most of its lifetime as the number one syndicated first-run show on television despite its falling number of viewers . Even when it became a near-serial show ( usually , long-term serial shows are ratings disasters -- witness Babylon 5 ) airing in prime-time in less than 60 percent of the nation , DS9 managed well over a 4.0 average in its final two years . As a general rule , a syndicated show needs to maintain a 3.0 to be successful , DS9 always maintained that despite the strikes against it . Look at the other sci-fi shows similar to DS9 : Earth : Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower 3.0 range and Babylon 5 is the hot potato of science fiction television -- it 's done so poorly that no one wants to hold on to it . <p> As a serial , more cultish television show , DS9 is right behind the X-Files on the all-time list of successes even with extreme disadvantages . <p> Voyager , on the other hand , has very little that it can brag about . That 's not because Voyager is an awful , unpopular show , but because it 's on an awful , unpopular network . Voyager can only do as well as UPN because of Voyager 's status as a network show . UPN has been losing stations since day one and is now only airing in a little over 60 percent of the nation , meaning that Voyager is competing in a very crowded market with both hands tied behind its back . For its disadvantages , Voyager has still managed to remain UPN 's top show . However , Voyager will never be able to perform near the level of its predecessors so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not the sign of viewers losing interest in Trek , it 's the sign that viewers are n't interested in UPN . <p> In short , the ratings *are* down . Less people are watching . The bleeding off of TNG 's more casual Trek audience is nearly complete and the shows are losing some of their viewers to competition . What does that mean ? Is Star Trek dying ? No , Star Trek is not dying , it 's just not a mainstream hit anymore . Things have grown far smaller , but smaller is n't necessarily bad as long as a show is maintaining minimum audiences , which so far Trek has done . Star Trek may someday stage a mainstream comeback with a TNG-sized hit , it may not . But as long as Star Trek maintains its loyal audience that it currently holds , the franchise will be fine .

One of the inmates is Garth of Izar , a Starfleet captain once greatly admired by Kirk who went mad after being horribly wounded in the line of duty . When Kirk and Spock beam down with a new treatment that may cure him , they discover that Dr. Cory , who runs the facility , has been imprisoned and that Garth has taken over , using his ability to shapeshift taught to him by friendly aliens . The mad Garth has himself crowned Lord of the Universe and tries to take over the Enterprise by impersonating Captain Kirk , but he can not answer Scotty 's demand for a security code .

When one Kirk demands that Spock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise , Spock realizes that that must be the Kirk he knows . The two of them overpower Garth , who is treated with the new medicine and cured of his megalomania . <p> Analysis : I had remembered " Whom Gods Destroy " as a real stinker , so I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed rewatching the episode . Although the inconsistencies and plot holes remain as gaping as ever , the storyline features dueling Kirks , an Orion dance , a double Vulcan neck pinch , bad recitations of Shakespeare and that rather touching scene in which Spock admits that he has come to think of Kirk as a brother . Okay , so the idea that a humanoid can be taught " cellular metamorphosis " that would allow him to transform instantly into any other being is ludicrous , and Spock 's logic appears to fail him utterly when he must determine which Kirk is the real Kirk ... could n't he ask a question like " What was your brother 's name ? " or " Who is the helmsman of the Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you promise never to discuss with anyone else ? " But then , of course , we would have been deprived of Kirk vs . Kirk , and what fun would that be ? <p> " Whom Gods Destroy " may be bad , but it revels in its badness . The villain has a clichTd Evil Bad Buy laugh , wants to be Master of the Universe - not even Khan aspired to that ! - and has a super-power . He may have been exiled to Elba ( II ) , but he still thinks of himself as a Napoleon , and he is so arrogant and cruel that he kills his Orion consort just to demonstrate that he can and will . It 's a horrible scene , yet a little difficult to take seriously , for the mad Garth and Marta are characterized more as cartoons than real people . Marta has some stellar comic moments nonetheless - trying to kill Kirk mid-seduction to put him out of his misery , for instance , plus claiming to be the most beautiful woman on a planet where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare may have written his Sonnet XVIII several hundred years ago , that does not alter the fact that she wrote it again yesterday . Though she seems unhinged , Marta does n't come across as nearly as insane as the others , most of whom passively follow Garth 's orders as if they 've been drugged ; she tries to warn Kirk that the doctor he meets is n't Cory , and she 's extremely articulate , if lacking judgment ... which is an improvement in some ways on other Orion women we 've seen on Star Trek . <p> Garth 's success hinges on a gimmick that 's crazier than he is : though apparently human , or whatever the equivalent from Izar might be called , he can transform himself and his clothes completely into any other being he wishes . The diagnosis of madness is necessary to explain why he keeps sabotaging very good charades ; he mimics Spock superbly ; I 'm still not sure exactly what tips Kirk off that he 's not the real thing . And I 'm not sure why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't shout , " Hey Scotty ! There 's a madman down here who can pretend to be anyone ! " so Scotty knows what he 's up against . But , like I said , logical thinking does n't seem to be high on anyone 's agenda in " Whom Gods Destroy . " Having a security code would seem to be a very clever idea , but how come we 've never seen one before ? A single sentence about how it 's a brand new protocol being tested would have fixed that . Sloppy , silly , though - again - kind of fun . <p> There 's not much in this episode worthy of deep analysis - otherwise questions would come up about whether Garth should be prosecuted for attempted genocide , not to mention Marta 's cold-blooded murder , and Scotty 's lack of creativity in mounting a rescue is quite disappointing - but there is that lovely scene where Kirk attempts to remind Lord Garth that he once held the venerable title of starship captain . Kirk reminds Garth of his strategic genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited as a young officer , which Garth makes Garth scoff - " Peace mission ! Politicians and weaklings !

" Gloating , Garth asks sarcastically , " Mr. Spock , do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers ? " , quite certain ( and perhaps rightly so ) that the logical reply will put Kirk down . <p> But instead Spock says , " Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively , and with undue emotion ; however , what he says is logical , and I do , in fact , agree with it . " It does n't get any more original Trek than that , and although Garth insists that Spock is blind - " You are his subordinate and that is all " - it is Garth who clearly does n't see the loyalty that is there , of a completely different nature than the terrified obedience he receives from those around him . It enables Spock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Kirk without asking logical questions , and it allows Spock to guess which man to shoot when the moment comes , though Kirk teases him about how long it takes him to figure out .

Data requests permission to examine it and discovers three preserved human bodies , which he beams back to the Enterprise when Picard arrives and orders the ship away at once . The ship has been directed to go to the Neutral Zone to discover why two Federation outposts have gone silent , which may presage new hostilities with the Romulans . While Picard , Riker and Troi try to guess what the Romulans might be up to , Crusher revives the cryogenically frozen humans , cures the medical conditions that caused their deaths in the 20th century and asks Picard and Data what is to be done with them .

" The Neutral Zone " has moderately engaging A and B stories but they have so little to do with one another that the episode is in some ways more frustrating than it might have been if it ditched either of the stories to do a better job with the other . This is the first season finale for The Next Generation and one has the impression that the writers decided they had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to throw in the Romulans to tantalize viewers into coming back ... but then they could n't figure out what they wanted to do with the Romulans in the future , whether they wanted them as villains or potential allies against a bigger threat not yet developed , so the Romulans simply appeared and disappeared again like a cloaked ship . From this twenty-years-on perspective it 's fun to see the Romulans because Marc Alaimo plays Commander Tebok - the first appearance of the man who will later play Gul Dukat , one of the greatest villains Star Trek has ever known - but otherwise the presence of Romulans at this juncture is mystifying at best and a waste at worst . <p> The people-out-of-time storyline has more potential , but it skirts the edges of TNG 's heavy-handed moralizing at the expense of giving the characters real personalities .

The banker is by far the most vocal and that makes him by far the most interesting even though he 's a walking cliche , demanding to see The Wall Street Journal and announcing that it 's not possessions but power that he seeks . The homemaker does n't seem to have any interests or needs beyond her sons and doofus of a husband - absolutely no sense of wonder that she 'll get to see the future , the world her descendants built .

Then it 's Riker whom Picard sends to talk to the awoken survivors , not Troi , who apparently only shares her skill as a counselor with the woman - not the businessman who 's completely lost his sense of identity and not the musician asking Crusher for a pick-me-up . Troi instead gets to try to psychoanalyze the Romulans , whom no one has seen in decades and who end up being so transparent that the businessman invading the bridge is able to read them as quickly as Picard can . ( The reason the businessman has the opportunity to offer this analysis is that Picard has the two most incompetent bridge security officers in the history of Starfleet ... first they fail to stop the guy from marching onto the bridge in the first place , and then , when ordered to escort him away , they drop him to gape at the Romulans onscreen ! ) <p> So we have two potential Cold War era allegories , neither of which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars who are supposed to mirror people from our own lives , except they all seem completely blind to the wonder of it all .

It 's somewhat condescending and pretty boring , and a very good thing the next season is on its way .

He invites Tucker along , even though the latter hates the climate . While the two are exploring strange new foods and learning local sports , T'Pol receives a hail from Trelit , the head of the region 's government . He informs her that Zobral is a terrorist , accuses Enterprise of aiding the criminals , and warns that the crew will probably not see their captain alive again . <p> T'Pol quickly contacts Archer with this information , suggesting that he and Tucker leave at once . But Zobral refuses to let them go . He has heard from visiting Suliban that Archer liberated an enormous prison , and wants to enlist his help in his struggle against a government that continues to enforce an unfair and illegal caste system . To protect the legendary Jonathan Archer , Zobral hides him and Tucker underground when government ships begin bombing the encampment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but more than 30 kilometers of desert lie between them and the ship in which they arrived . <p> Because Archer and Tucker have not left the surface , Trelit assumes Enterprise is in league with the enemy and threatens to attack any shuttlepod launched from Enterprise . The planet also has a shield that blocks sensors . As he and Archer stumble through the desert , Tucker , who overexerted himself playing sports the day before , becomes dehydrated and gets heatstroke . Archer hauls him to the abandoned ruins of a building where he attempts to purify what little water he can find . Meanwhile Zobral returns to Enterprise , where T'Pol and Reed tell him that Archer is not a legendary warrior and moreover that they hold him responsible for getting Archer and Tucker stranded on a planet whose government believes they are enemy agents . <p> Archer tries to keep Tucker from falling into a coma by quizzing him on warp reactors and playing Geography , but when the government bombing raids begin again , he realizes that he must drag his friend back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Zobral 's help , Reed pilots a shuttle through the planetary defenses , enabling T'Pol to pick up human life signs by scanning in the area being attacked . They rescue Archer and Tucker . Zobral says a cold farewell when Archer informs him that even if he was a great warrior , he could not have helped the alien 's cause . Privately the captain admits to T'Pol that he believes it was a cause worth fighting for , but T'Pol says that such decisions should be left to governments , not starship captains . <p> Analysis : All the elements come together in ' Desert Crossing ' -- solid plot , good acting , great continuity , a break from the monotony of the ship and some of the Big Themes for which Star Trek has long been appreciated . At the start , Enterprise is back on course for Risa , their destination in ' Fallen Hero ' before being diverted by the Vulcans ; this time they 're diverted by a distress call , and it 's pretty amusing when Archer admits that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know just how serious Zobral is when he says he wo n't take no for an answer to his offer of hospitality . After eating blood soup filled with chunks of the essence of the male , as Zobral explains , he learns an alien version of lacrosse . He also receives a gift of Suliban artwork , yet somehow this does n't set off Archer 's personal red alert . <p> And then we see him pay for his meddling in the Suliban prison camp -- a gutsy and unexpected twist , given the moral absolutes presented in ' Detained . ' Unlike that episode , in which the imprisoned Suliban were unquestionably innocents while the government officials were clearly fascists , ' Desert Crossing ' has a lot of gray areas . Zobral never denies being a terrorist , admits he wants Archer 's arsenal , and although we 're given no reason to doubt his account of caste oppression , we 're given no reason to believe it either -- considering his manipulation of Archer and his gross distortion of the facts of the Suliban prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth to fit his own ends . Still , he comes across as magnanimous , with a booming British voice reminiscent of John Rhys-Davies in the Indiana Jones movies . Although Trelit is portrayed unsympathetically , a knee-jerk bureaucrat willing to sacrifice the innocent , we 're not given reasons to doubt his fears . The only thing that 's certain is the civil war . <p> Well , that and the fact that Suliban sympathetic to those who escaped the Tandarans have done business with Zobral . Here are the real consequences of Archer 's meddling , and they are potentially much bigger than his own suffering . What if the freed Suliban become freedom fighters , idolizing a distorted image of Jonathan Archer , characterizing Earth as a place sympathetic to the displaced and humans as willing warriors for the oppressed ? I 'd love to have seen a scene in which Archer sheepishly explained to Admiral Forrest that there might be other aliens who expect him to become their savior . <p> T'Pol cites High Command protocols and suggests that Archer needs directives of his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out , the Vulcans landing in the U.S. for first contact must have made other countries nervous . And now , she adds , humans are in the position of getting involved in wars just by accepting dinner invitations ; it 's a necessary risk on first contact missions , since warp technology developed on one continent does n't necessarily indicate peace or prosperity on the others . In ' Fallen Hero , ' V'Lar suggests that humans are relatively undeveloped as a species , but I 'd expect it to be the rule rather than the exception to find a race in space that 's a peaceful democracy . Nobody seems to have avoided relations with the Ferengi just because of centuries of systematically oppressing their females . It would have been very interesting to see what would have happened had a Ferengi female asked for Federation assistance in fighting off patriarchal oppression . <p> Politics aside , the visual pleasures of this episode abound -- and I do n't mean Archer and Tucker with their shirts off , though they 've both obviously been putting in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lacrosse-type game with its glowing ball actually looks intriguing , unlike Tsunkatse , Velocity and most other sports manufactured for genre television . Zobral 's home has an interesting mix of Native American and Middle Eastern-looking tapestries and dining implements . I wondered a bit whether anyone wore sunblock and whether Archer would n't have been better off bringing T'Pol down with him -- Vulcan , after all , is supposed to be hot as hell . Unlike previous Trek shows ' uniforms , Enterprise desert wear really let 's you see them sweat . <p> The hurt/comfort quotient of the Archer/Tucker scenes remind me of Voyager 's ' The Chute , ' particularly when Archer ends up embracing Tucker to keep him safe from overhead missiles . ( Slash fans are going to have a lot of fun with ' Desert Crossing ' ; " ' Tell me what you want , ' pleads Archer , and Tucker replies ... " ) .

I 've been an editor here at Pocket Books handling Star Trek books for so long that DS9 was still in production . As the last hired , I was given the task that everyone hates , the black hole of book production : calendars . Come on , you wonder , how hard can it be to do a calendar ? Twelve images and you 're done . ( Actually it 's fourteen . ) <p> However , if you care you start choosing photography with the rule of thumb that every lead actor : one , should have a shot by themselves ; two , that is interesting ; three , that is flattering and four , that has n't been used before . Not so easy . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I saw a cast shot , for a particular show , used as a cover image one more time , I was going to scream . Pocket had reached out to Gary Hutzel and he had done a cover for us I called Gary and asked if he would do calendar covers and centerfolds . He did for TNG , several DS9 , and even a TOS . The images he created were unique and exclusive to Pocket . We got a lot of positive feedback from the fans . <p> Then we were asked to add a calendar to the mix . At the time , I had a book project with budget issues , but I reasoned that if I could defray the cost of producing the book by creating images for a calendar and reusing them in the book it could work . I asked the authors of the book , Mojo and Rob Bonchue , if they could create fourteen images for a calendar .

He not just one of the talented artist I use and abuse , he is my " ship wrangler .

( Oh , and could I have it ready in six to eight weeks ? ) Ships popped into my head , but I wondered if I had enough images for a book . Even I was amazed by how many we did have , and how I did n't have to use every ship image that was ever created for us . I knew that I needed text that would speak to the heart of Star Trek . I could only think of one person to write it , and luckily Mike Okuda agreed . <p> Ships of the Line is a unique book , and I 'm not saying that because I 'm the editor .

There are echoes of the feminist dystopian classic The Handmaid 's Tale , in that much-needed cogenitors are not permitted to read or to go outside without permission from their families ( ostensibly for their own protection ) and they can be passed around among otherwise infertile couples without any participation in the rearing of their own children . There are also parallels with The Next Generation 's " The Outcast " another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sexless society are brainwashed if they reveal that they have a gender preference , and an Enterprise ( 1701-D ) crewmember 's involvement puts one such person in danger . <p> Yet the scenario mostly makes me think of Octavia Butler 's phenomenal Xenogenesis trilogy , in which humans are forced into reproduction with a third sex from another species . It 's creepy and titillating and upsetting all at once to realise how much coercion can be involved even in " normal " compulsive heterosexuality . We 're not led to doubt the desperation of Vissian couples for cogenitors , nor the deeply held belief that cogenitors can not be educated . The prejudices obviously date back a long time . These are people who understand Shakespeare and Sophocles , though it takes a member of the oppressed minority to grok The Day The Earth Stood Still . <p> And of course it has to be Tucker who discovers the situation , not only because Connor Trinneer 's a superb actor who can make viewers believe in the depth of Trip 's involvement , but also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he can prevent it . He sees a person not a gender , not a species even when he 's checking out T'Pol 's cat-suited figure or her Vulcan physiology . This is a big difference between Tucker and Reed , who is shockingly irresponsible about allowing an alien into his armory and does n't even seem interested in hearing about photonics once he hears that he can get her naked without any effort . Tucker , on the other hand , is old-fashioned enough to get uneasy when Phlox offers to show him pictures of three-way alien sex . He does n't want to think about the differences , he wants points of common reference , the same way he looks for commonalities while making engine comparisons with the Vissian engineer . <p> T'Pol is right that this is a mistake , for Tucker genuinely does n't see how devastating his interference might be , not only for the cogenitor , but for everyone else on the Vissian ship or conceivably the entire society , were the cogenitor to come into contact with others . Yet Tucker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humans certainly in his era , but hopefully in our own as well the cogenitors are treated appallingly . They 're essentially sex slaves , kept in home prisons , fed only one meal a day except on special occasions , denied privacy , freedom of movement , free speech , every right imaginable . We 're led to believe that the Vissian engineer and the scientist to whom he 's married are fundamentally decent people ; it simply does n't occur to them that a cogenitor could or should be treated otherwise . Tucker 's shock almost seems too little , and T'Pol 's icy refusal even to listen to his concerns is absolutely infuriating . <p> Archer , who has in essence been on vacation , flying a sophisticated alien ship in and out of particle waves , returns home with a new friend only to discover the magnitude of the crisis affecting both ships . He 's frustrated on a personal level , for he 's just had a fantastic first contact experience and met an alien captain who treats him with respect despite the inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend and trusted officer has so badly misjudged what Archer would have done in the situation . The scene in which Trip tells his captain confidently that he tried to emulate Archer is heartbreaking , because one wants Tucker to be right , and on one level he is right and Archer knows it , for he refuses to send the cogenitor back without at least making inquiries . <p> But even without a Prime Directive , even without any threats from the much stronger Vissians , he knows that he can not rewrite centuries of Vissian history and tradition based on his ethical beliefs . This is no knee-jerk decision ; we see him agonise over it , and when he learns that his actions have led to the death of the cogenitor , it brings tears to his eyes , though he claims he 's upset about his failure to be a proper role model . For Tucker this may have been a test of non-interference , but by the time Archer arrives on the scene , it 's a Kobayashi Maru , a no-win scenario ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead and the Vissians are upset , and even less of a surprise to see that Archer is more shaken than Tucker , who despite his apologies seems never really to doubt that he made his choices for the right reasons . <p> Archer tellingly says that he might agree if they were in Florida or Singapore . Why Singapore , a city unfortunately associated for many years with child labor and traffic in underage sex , regularly condemned by various human rights organisations ? I do n't believe the suggestion is that Americans have no right to judge that situation ; far from it . But if Archer believes that humans can and should interfere with sexual oppression wherever it occurs on their own world , is n't it awfully hard to rationalise completely ignoring it elsewhere , among people whom he hopes will become allies ? <p> The writers strongly indicate that regardless of necessity of non-interference , it 's extremely difficult and painful to make such choices . As Braga and Berman 's names came up at the close of " Cogenitor " , I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to remember the last time Star Trek made me cry over a moral dilemma as opposed to tragic deaths like Damar 's in " What You Leave Behind " . DS9 's " Duet " did that to me , and " The Ship " , and long ago the original series ' " City on the Edge of Forever " and " The Empath " , but episodes with this much substance to them are few and far between . ( And whichever UPN executive signed off on the fluffy sex promo for " Cogenitor " should be fired . ) <p> But none of this would work were this not also an excellent character story . I already said that Trinneer is superb , but I do n't want to neglect mentioning how good Scott Bakula is as well . For most of this episode , Archer is n't captain-like ; he 's goofy and enthusiastic on the Vissian stratopod , and he 's on the verge of losing it with Tucker from the moment he gets back . It 's amazing how powerful it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't know how to cope with his own grief and guilt except by ranting , and he has to dismiss Tucker before the engineer can see it . He does n't even bother to discipline Trip properly , he just wants him out of the room . T'Pol , by contrast , is so stiff and unfeeling that one wants to shake her ; one of the problems with having Jolene Blalock play a more emotional Vulcan than we 've usually seen is that when she does n't show emotion , she seems far too icy . <p> The special effects in this episode are , well , stellar , especially the little ship dodging solar flares . It 's an absolute thrill to see Andreas Katsulas , who played G'Kar on Babylon 5 and the Romulan Tomalak on The Next Generation , on this show ; he 's a bit under-used , however , and I would love to see the Vissian captain return . In fact I would love to see the Vissians return , because I imagine that this situation will continue to haunt Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it will affect anyone on the alien ship as well . I ca n't imagine a follow-up that would n't be something of a letdown after the emotional twists of " Cogenitor " , so nothing would thrill me more than to be surprised . 
@@58304313 @7304313/ <h> Retro Review : The Killing Game , Part II <p> While Janeway and Chakotay fight the Hirogen , Seven and the Doctor plot holographic insurgence against the Nazis . <p> Plot Summary : Janeway and Seven sneak into the astrometrics lab to figure out how many Hirogen control the ship . The alpha Hirogen refuses to kill the now-cognizant prey because they need help rebuilding the holodeck , though his underling disables the Doctor and orders other Hirogen to leave the prey dying where they fall . Meanwhile , in the Nazi simulation , Chakotay and Tuvok plot to bring down the German super-weapon and agree to follow Janeway-as-Katrine to disable the technology . Janeway sneaks herself and Chakotay into the Klingon holographic scenario and summons the Doctor , suggesting using holographic weapons to disable the neural implants in the real sickbay . Because the safeties have been disabled , the Hirogen cant use holographic technology to protect his own people . Just as Janeway sets off the pulse that makes the crew remember their true identities , the Nazis take control of Katrines establishment , trapping Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeway agrees to a truce with the Hirogen leader and promises to give him holographic technology to save his people , the Hirogen on the holodeck listen to the Nazi ideology of the Hauptsturmf++hrer and refuses to lay down his weapons . He kills the alpha Hirogen and orders Janeway to start running like prey . Fortunately , the Doctor has enlisted Neelix to lead the holographic and crewmember Klingons into the fray , which slows the Hirogen . Though wounded , Janeway leads the Hirogen into an area where the holographic emitters are not functioning . When he refuses to stand down , she shoots him . While the Klingons hold off the Nazis , Harry overloads the holo-emitters , causing all the holographic Nazis to disappear . Now outnumbered , the Hirogen ultimately are forced to agree to a ceasefire . Janeway gives the new leader an optronic data core to create their own holographic prey or to keep as a trophy . <p> Analysis : " The Killing Game , Part II " is little more than a big action movie , but like the first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its prequel in terms of the fun factor . Most of the cast get a chance to shine , too : Neelix gets to be a Klingon warrior , Kim for once gets to save the ship ( a refreshing change from this seasons trend of always letting Seven save the ship ) . As much as I wish we 'd gotten to see more of Katrine , I 'm glad Janeway is herself both as a fighter and a negotiator , though I have some serious Prime Directive concerns about Janeway handing over holographic technology to a culture that lives to hunt and kill everyone else . Of course she thinks she 's doing the Delta Quadrant as well as the Hirogen a favor , giving them the capability to create artificial prey and stop losing their own members to dangerous hunts , and the idea initially came from a Hirogen leader , so it is n't as if she 's forcing a change upon them . But just as Kirk discovered in " A Piece of the Action , " the Federation wont always be around to control how this outside technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holographic prey but holographic lures and tricks for sentient prey . Given the new Hirogen commanders skepticism about the value of the technology in the first place , I 'm hoping the optronic data core Janeway turns over as a potential trophy is more a schematic than a working model , forcing the Hirogen to settle down a bit and develop their own science . There are probably Prime Directive issues even with that sort of interference , since its putting Federation values on a nomadic culture , but at least enough of them will survive to decide what sort of relations they want to have with other aliens in the region and the other aliens will have some time to protect themselves if necessary . <p> There 's one aspect of the scenario that really troubles me , and that 's Torress relationship with and pregnancy by a holographic Nazi . Its never explained precisely how that works does she have a holographic baby inside her , or is it all a trick of clothing and external holograms ? Torres can feel it kicking even after her implant is turned off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holographic lungs within a very specific set of Sickbay parameters . Brigitte certainly believes that she is pregnant , she 's not pretending to be to manipulate the Hauptsturmf++hrer she tells Davis a.k.a . Paris as much so are we to assume that Torres has implanted memories of sex with the babys father , which would constitute a sex crime even if she does n't  remember it after the implant switches off ? We know that she has no attachment either as Brigitte or as herself to the Hauptsturmf++hrer , but Brigitte must have complicated emotions toward the child shes carrying and we never learn how Torres feels about it beyond annoyance about the holographic weight gain . ( Please tell me that someone has developed a program to allow men to experience holographic pregnancy by the 24th century . ) I think it would be enormously traumatic to come out of mind control and find oneself pregnant , then to learn that an enemy is the purported father , even if the pregnancy is holographic and can be switched off with no physical suffering . If I were Torres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Seven did when her Borg implants triggered memories of experiencing and witnessing abuses . Brigitte may have consented for the good of the Resistance , but no one ever asks her host Torres how she feels about any of it . The most we get is a throwaway moment in which Davis calls Brigittes holographic lover a pig , played for humor because all the way back in " The Cloud " when the characters visited Sandrines , Torres called one of Paris holograms a pig and added that Paris was one , too . <p> My other quarrel with the episode is also gender-related , when Captain Miller tells Katrine that the babes back home are n't  as gung-ho as she is . Five minutes of research about women on the home front before and during the second world war would have shown the writers how completely wrong they were about that not just in fact but in public perception during the Depression and the lead-up to the war . Ill put up with it , though , because it may just be Miller looking for a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fun to see Paris and Torres flirt as ex-lovers who never quite got over each other , its even more fun to watch Chakotay developing a crush on Janeway even though he does n't  know who she is , or who he is for that matter ; he does n't  appear to be at all interested in Seven even though she looks just as stunning in her black Resistance garb as she did in the slinky silver dress , and its understandable that Tuvok would think their Aryan poster girl might be a Nazi spy . Seven herself is entertaining when in trying to avoid having to sing for them , she warns the Hirogen that the Borg will eventually assimilate them . Meanwhile Chakotay and Paris have several nice moments together the two of them should get more casual interaction when were not in an alternate reality , two humans familiar with Earth history sharing that common interest and Paris manages to corner Kim while the former does n't  remember who he really is but the latter does , using a 20th century movie trivia question to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can believe Kim could actually pass because we saw Kim giving Torres a movie trivia quiz to keep her distracted from an injury in " The Year of Hell . " I also must admit that I really love watching Klingons beat up Nazis . For that scene alone , this action story would be a keeper . <p> This is going to be my last retro review , at least for a while . TrekToday is undergoing some changes and after more than a decade and a half of reviewing here , I 'm not sure when I 'll be back . Its been a lot of fun experiencing Voyager all over again ; its never going to feel like those giddy first weeks two decades ago when I fell in love with the show , but with some distance , I can really appreciate elements I ignored or disliked on a first viewing , especially all that Jeri Ryan contributed she never let up the level of intensity she brought to Seven of Nine .

Winn gets to assassinate the man who 's both the scheming architect of the Occupation of Bajor and the wraith-possessed would-be destroyer of Bajor , his red eyes gleaming as they did when he murdered Jadzia Dax . Plus Winn gets to revel in the pleasure of her actions in a way Sisko does n't  . Her arguments with Dukat are laced with wry humor and an undercurrent of the apparently scorching sex they had before she discovered his true identity sex they 're both willing to toy with the idea of sharing again , even though he suggests that she 's weak and pathetic while she calls him heinous and loathsome . These characters are fascinating in their complexity , never mere villains ; Winn despises Dukat for his treatment of Bajorans even as she plots to kill their gods and let the unworthy die , while Dukats remorse for the Occupation seems to be genuine once he understands the power of the Bajoran gods and their adversaries . The pair at times seem genuinely regretful that they must destroy one another , since there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hope that Winn survives her immolation just as Dukat does and theyll be trapped in the Fire Caves clawing at each other for all eternity . That is the ending they both truly deserve . <p> Its nice to see so many love stories emerge , even if many of them are destined for painful conclusions . Dax really seems to be the consolation prize for Bashir after OBrien torn for years between his family and his best friend to such a degree that even his young daughter is aware of it runs out of excuses not to make a choice between Keiko and Julian , and promises to take his wife home . Its not quite a happy ending for Dax and Bashir , just as its not quite a tragic ending for Kira and Odo , who embody the adage that if you love something , you must set it free to know whether its truly yours . There 's no question that they love each other very deeply , yet no question for either that they must separate so that they can decide who they are apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things theyll never share . Odo has said repeatedly that if it werent for Kira , hed be with his people , which is a great burden for her to shoulder she must be not only his lover but his entire world . I like to think that theyll find their way back together at least to remain in communication if not the communion that Odo shares with the Great Link . As much as I love the pairing , I appreciate that Kiras most memorable moments in this finale are not as Odos lover but as a Cardassian liberation fighter , bringing her full circle from the onetime Bajoran terrorist who learned how to fight tyranny by attacking the very people she now seeks to help . <p> The Dominion collapses when its center turns on itself , borrowing a metaphor from Star Wars , which is fine because the gigantic fleet battle here is really more space opera than science fiction , with beautifully filmed perspective shots echoed by , of all things , Vic and Quark in overhead visual at the bar . ( The interweaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gorgeous too and quite tear-jerking . ) There are only a couple of things I 'm even a little bit bummed about : its a little sad that Bajor has n't  yet joined the Federation , a little aggravating that Jadzia Dax does n't  appear even in a photo , a little frustrating that we never see if Bounty Hunter Princess Leia is really under all those Breen helmets , a little disturbing that the new ambassador to QonoS is the sworn brother of the new Chancellor , which Klingons who drink blood wine over the bodies of their enemies may not find to be a conflict of interest but I 'd think the Federation would . If there 's a missing scene , its at the very end , when I always half-expect to see Benny Russell typing the final letters of the story on his typewriter . Smiling . Sisko can never die , for this series has belonged to the fans for over 15 years .

Aboard the Enterprise , McCoy cautions that the children may be suffering from a kind of post-traumatic shock , but Spock believes that the adults on the mission must have been attacked by an unknown entity that caused their despair and may be responsible for the children 's apathy .

This is the performance on which every comedian bases his impersonation of William Shatner : the scenes where Kirk loses control of himself , first in the cave on Triacus and then on the ship in the turbolift , are so comically awful that it 's impossible to take anything else in the episode seriously . The children do n't help matters either : Tommy Starnes , the oldest of the children , is a sneering , scrawny know-it-all boy who is considerably easier to despise than Wesley Crusher , while the three younger boys are largely interchangeable and the little girl is one of those adorable demons in blonde ringlets like the eternally annoying Cindy Brady . <p> In an odd twist of fate , though , I rewatched this episode to review the night my husband 's grandmother died - we had just put it on and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paused the DVD . So some of what I had considered the most exaggerated aspects of the storyline , like Spock 's analogizing the children 's refusal to grieve with pure evil , had a kind of sad resonance ; the story 's still dreadfully executed , but the concept did n't seem as stupid from the outset as it always had to me before . The children are focused on very superficial distractions like ice cream and running games , which Tommy really seems too old for : like the pre-adolescents in Miri , he 's pathetically clinging to childhood in a way that 's absolutely creepy , even though he also likes the privilege of being the oldest and therefore the de facto leader of the children . <p> It 's never clear how the alien managed to distract the children so thoroughly that they ignored their parents ' deaths - losing a parent is often the most terrifying nightmare for children , yet though Gorgan preys on the beasts of others , he suppresses this very thing in his young followers . It 's not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these children away from parents who , from the records of the expedition , were affectionate and involved in their children 's lives . So the horror of the opening image in which all the adults are seen dead by their own hands while the children race through playing hide and seek diminishes as the episode continues : it 's not quite plausible , particularly when Tommy says that his parents are happy on Triacus , as if they 're still alive . <p> Kirk makes many stupid decisions in this episode . He feels unaccountable anxiety in the cave on Triacus and nearly falls apart , but instead of going to McCoy for immediate evaluation or concentrating on what might have been the causes of that feeling in the cave , he goes back up to the ship and sends down teams of security officers to patrol . Sulu and Chekov manage to take the Enterprise out of orbit without attracting anyone 's attention , and Kirk orders two more security officers beamed down to the planet before anyone bothers to check whether the planet is still there - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He leaves Tommy on the bridge while he and Spock both go off to consult with McCoy , even though he 's already put a guard on the children because he suspects that something is not right , thus allowing Tommy to seize complete control . Kirk 's authority is further undercut by Shatner 's fits of acting - one gets the impression that he simply could not take the script seriously , and thus could not portray fear or unhappiness with nearly the conviction he showed in " The Paradise Syndrome " or " The City on the Edge of Forever . " <p> The hallucinations we see for the rest of the crew are just plain goofy . Uhura sees her death , but her major concern ( in the mirror she apparently keeps beside her console in case she needs to freshen her makeup or something ) seems to be that she is no longer young and pretty ; Sulu sees a giant collection of knives that look like a Renaissance Faire armory wall decoration . Scotty , by contrast , does n't sound that different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines being strained . Because Scotty 's and Spock 's inner demons are so close to their usual characterizations , Sulu 's and Uhura 's seem hopelessly overplayed , even though we as viewers can actually see the knives and the aged visage whereas we ca n't see whatever Spock and Scotty are picturing happening to the ship . Even the production crew was n't trying this episode : we see the same knife patterns swirl on the viewscreen , we see the same shots of the kids shaking their fists to make the crew obey them , and Gorgan 's rather bland appearance inspires neither awe nor fear . Given that the episode is a bottle show - the planet is clearly an artificial indoor set rather than a location shoot , and most of the story takes place on the Enterprise - the lack of visual distraction coupled with all the intense close-ups of some of the weaker performances of the series makes for pretty unimpressive entertainment . <p> When an episode is too dreadful to take seriously , like this one becomes after the crew loses control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually by laughing at it . The worst moment of " And the Children Shall Lead " is also its saving grace for me : the scene with Kirk in the turbolift clinging to Spock like he 's afraid of losing his boyfriend , wailing that he 's all alone until Spock , whose face is close enough to kiss him just by puckering his lips , murmurs , " Jim . " This is screamingly funny if you 're not of the inclination to find it perversely touching , and I can watch it either way . I ca n't remember now who wrote the parody of this scene where Kirk stammers , " Spock ! I 'm losing my ability to act ! " and Spock gently replies , " Jim . You never had any , " but I ca n't stop thinking about it , listening to Shatner babbling about how he 's losing command and looking like he 's embarrassed to be there while Nimoy plays Spock with a sweet earnestness that refuses to scoff at this preposterous situation because Spock would be concerned first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases coming out of his mouth .

Humans are not allowed contact with Medusans because their physiology is so radically different that most species go insane when looking upon them , though Vulcans are able to do so while wearing special visors . When Jones ' jealous assistant Larry Marvick tries to kill Kollos , he sees the unshielded Medusan and becomes dangerously paranoid . Taking control of the Enterprise , Marvick strands the ship far beyond the reaches of the galaxy before dying of his madness . <p> Because the blind Jones can not pilot the Enterprise , Spock mind-melds with Kollos over her objections and uses Medusan understanding of navigation to guide the ship home .

Her experience doing so enables her to form a mind link with Kollos , and the two are delivered to his home planet while Spock recovers . <p> Analysis : " Is There In Truth No Beauty ? " would be a keeper for the concept of the Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations alone , though the IDIC was created as a marketing scheme to sell to fans and legend has it that Leonard Nimoy refused to wear the pendant until Gene Roddenberry rewrote the script to make it less heavy-handed . Roddenberry created all of Star Trek to be a commercial product and make money ; I do n't care whether he created the IDIC because he thought it was pretty , he thought it would sell or it represented his most deeply-held beliefs , it 's one of the most important concepts I took away from Star Trek as a child and the one I find myself citing most often when people ask why the series still has relevance forty years after its debut . <p> It 's rather a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the IDIC is introduced here , because the idea that people are stronger , smarter and empowered when they step outside their usual boxes and belief systems has no less relevance today than it did during the tumultuous 1960s or really any other human era . It 's also a shame that Sulu , Chekov and Uhura are n't included at the scene where Jones and the senior officers sit at dinner in their dress uniforms - Spock wearing the Vulcan symbol , Scotty his kilt - while they try to puzzle out the meaning of " beauty " and consider whether Keats had it right when he wrote , " Beauty is truth , truth beauty - that is all/Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . " <p> Despite some awkward pacing , weak dialogue and un-Vulcan behavior , " Is There In Truth No Beauty ? " remains one of my favorite episodes for several reasons . Miranda Jones remains one of my favorite female characters from the original series ( and I have continued affection for Diana Muldaur , who later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a bit of ' 60s sexism in her characterization - screaming when she learns that Kollos would like to meld with Spock , for instance - but Marvick is far more of a jealous hysteric than she is , and she handles herself quite well when Kirk turns on the charm to try to distract her from Spock 's plans to meld with Kollos . She does n't buy any of his blather about the attractions of one of her own kind , nor his unpleasant repetition of Marvick 's insistence that she should act more like a woman , which in both cases seems to mean she should submit sexually to a man just because he 's attracted to her . Obviously she has major issues with intimacy , but those are from growing up blind and pitied and from being a telepath , subject to the random lustful , violent , hostile thoughts of the humans around her before she studied with the Vulcans .

The sensor web on her dress seems to be a forerunner of Geordi LaForge 's VISOR , for like him , she can perceive things that ordinary humans can not , such as precise distances and physiological changes in the people around her . And she is also gifted - and cursed - with extrasensory perception that enables her to hide her inability to see from others .

At one point Kirk , Spock , and McCoy all appear to be competing for Jones , exchanging barbs and wondering how she can want to spend the rest of her life with a creature as ugly as Kollos ; Jones wins the argument handily , asking McCoy how he can want to spend the rest of his life looking at disease . Even Kollos , within Spock 's body , is very nearly overcome by passion , contemplating how lonely humans must be in their shells of flesh . Having learned a lesson from Sargon , Kirk quickly orders Kollos out of the shell of flesh before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a bottle show , the episode moves fairly quickly , if jerkily ; the Marvick storyline seems to drag on , and the powerful story is n't served very well by the cheesy music and eerie lighting used to represent the alien ambassador .

On the other hand , the costuming in the dinner scene is great fun , particularly Scotty 's kilt , and there are some different camera angles on the bridge when the ship leaves normal space-time and Spock and Chekov look for ways to repair the damage . It 's also nice to see the Enterprise 's arboretum again . And any time we get to see Spock smiling in a plausible situation - not because evil aliens or spores have taken over his body - is a cause for celebration . <p> There are also some lovely moments that link this episode into the series as a whole that make up for its flaws .

" with , " That 's Spock ! " <p> And Spock quotes The Tempest to Miranda , too . There 's a sense of growth , accomplishment and wonder throughout " Is There In Truth No Beauty ?

Though Kirk is certain that there has been some mistake , he is forced to accept that Spock lied to him when Spock takes the ship and Captain Pike to Talos IV - a planet visited only once previously , by Captain Pike and his crew . Anyone contacting that planet ever since has faced the death penalty .

They have a human female captive they rescued from a crash and hope to breed a colony of humans to maintain their technology , but when they discover that Pike and his crewmembers would rather die than accept captivity , they let the Enterprise go , telling the humans that further contact is impossible because if human beings learned their powers of illusion , they would destroy themselves . <p> The courtmartial officers all find Spock guilty , but by then the Enterprise has reached Talos IV , where the Talosians communicate directly to Kirk , who realizes that Spock was determined to bring Pike to Talos IV to free him from his shattered body and allow him to live via illusion ; Spock did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kirk also learns that Mendez was never on board , but was an illusion to distract Kirk from attempting to regain control of the engines , so the courtmartial decision against Spock will not stand . After viewing the Talosian evidence , Starfleet also agrees not to press charges against Spock , and Pike is invited to spend his life on Talos IV with the severely injured human woman he met their years before . <p> Analysis : Two of the finest hours of Star Trek ever made , " The Menagerie " incorporates the series ' original pilot into a two-parter that deepens and complicates Spock 's character in both the past and present , turning some of the flaws of " The Cage " into assets . There is a great deal to like in the story witnessed in flashback - a captain facing some of the dilemmas that regularly afflict Kirk concerning risks to the crew and the difficulty of a personal life , the highest-ranking woman we will see in Starfleet until The Next Generation , another crew that appears to have strong personal bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are also some things that make me profoundly glad that " The Cage " was not picked up as the initial episode of Star Trek , most notably a captain who 's not quite Kirk , a doctor who 's not quite McCoy and a Spock who 's not quite Spock , though there are also some excruciating attitudes about women and sexuality despite a female " Number One " that make me flinch . <p> Structurally the episode is a bit awkward , setting up the backstory via exposition in which Kirk and Mendez discuss the Talosian situation and Pike 's accident while Spock gets in a few gratuitous action sequences knocking out guards so he can send false messages to the Enterprise . There 's no real damage done , but it 's a good thing no enemies of Starfleet picked this week to attack , and one really wonders about starbase security when one man can singlehandedly control so many systems as well as beaming a critically injured patient right off the facility . The story picks up once Kirk is aboard the Enterprise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendez , whom we will later learn is really an illusion - he plays to Kirk 's expectations of how a commodore would respond - insists that such material has no business being aired at a courtmartial , but Kirk and Pike both permit Spock to display this evidence , telling much more of the story within the story than is truly necessary for his defense , for Pike 's emotional state before visiting Talos is hardly relevant in terms of the charges against his former science officer . <p> The story of " The Cage " is itself engrossing and entertaining , though it brings up a number of questions about the intelligence of the Talosians , such as why they did n't try to keep more human subjects to study and how they believed a single pair could breed an entire colony of workers . They repeatedly insult the captive Pike 's intelligence for not having realized earlier that he was facing a fantasy on the surface rather than reality , yet he is quick to figure out not just their motives but their weaknesses , even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings that rescued her from the wreckage of an Earth ship many years earlier , only to make her their slave and seek out a male counterpart . His strategy in trapping a Keeper , forcing the Talosian to show him the hole his phaser made in the wall and his final display of compassion - allowing Vina and the Keeper to return inside when Number One sets her phaser to overload - ultimately makes him seem both more clever and more highly evolved than the Talosians themselves . <p> Vina insists that the Talosians do n't mean to be cruel , and indeed they seem determined to create a sense of happy nuclear family among their victims ... though one wonders whether , if they had abducted Kirk rather than Christopher Pike , they would have provided a harem in deference to his apparent preferences instead of a lone woman . Presumably much of what the Talosians have learned about humans and their desires comes from Vina , so it is interesting that they are ready to cast her aside and provide Pike with an alternate female rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working between them . Since Vina was so badly damaged in the crash that brought her to Talos IV , it is curious that they wish to keep her as breeding stock rather than choosing a healthier human woman from Pike 's crew . Their loyalty to Vina and later to the returning Pike is formidable . Did they learn this quality from the humans they had hoped to enslave , by reading their minds ? Or was it already a part of them , and if so , where did these delicate creatures of illusion find the steel to carry out their plot to breed slaves ? <p> I really loathe Vina 's reasons for not departing with the Enterprise and Pike 's easy acceptance of the suggestion that being ugly is a reason for a woman to choose illusion over having a life . Presumably there would be medical help for her back at a starbase , though I would understand if she thought her health could never be repaired and for that reason chose illusion over pain . While she might never be as young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty are still so essential to a woman 's happiness that she would rather never see another human than be seen as ugly is really quite offensive . I assume she was a scientist on the mission that took her to Talos , since Number One begins to calculate her age as a crewmember ; would n't she want to share what she had learned ? Certainly she is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and a degree of symbiotic dependence upon her captors , but the fact that Pike merely says he understands rather than trying to persuade her of all she might have to live for back home does n't make me like him much . <p> It 's a great relief that we did n't end up with a Star Trek series where from the first episode the captain has overt sexual tension with both his first officer and a pretty young thing on his crew ... well , okay , arguably Kirk had that too , but not with so much melodrama from the get-go . ( The " Who would have been Eve ? " line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Menagerie " but its implication remains . ) Yet some of the elements of that original pilot are replicated successfully in the Star Trek that would be : the drinking-buddy aspect of the captain 's relationship with his doctor , the logical , purportedly unemotional first officer , the brash younger bridge crew ready to die at their captain 's order , and particularly the spirit of exploration and compassion which are hallmarks of the original Star Trek . <p> Kirk and Spock 's relationship is cemented for all future episodes in " The Menagerie " , ironically as Spock mutinies and disproves the adage that Vulcans ca n't lie . As passionate as Kirk is defending Spock to Mendez , he 's equally convinced that Spock could and would distort the truth if Spock had a compelling reason to do so - and unlike McCoy , Kirk 's not convinced that the Vulcan is incapable of such strong feeling for his onetime captain that he would never resort to breaking the law to bring Pike a measure of happiness . The two-parter concludes with a tag that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that is flagrantly emotional , then attributes his actions to logic and accuses the humans of insulting him if they suggest otherwise ; it becomes a private joke between Spock , Kirk and McCoy in " Amok Time " and " The Galileo 7 " , but here it 's something deeper , the first tacit understanding between Kirk and Spock of the degree to which Spock is not Vulcan but just as capable of loyalty and love as Kirk . <p> For if " the needs of the many outweigh the needs of few , or the one " , as Spock so famously declares later on , his decision to divert a starship and face the death penalty for Pike makes no logical sense whatsoever . What has happened to Pike is a grave tragedy , but Spock puts numerous other people at risk , fighting the engineers and security officers on Starbase 11 , forcing Kirk to follow him in a shuttle until the ship 's oxygen is almost gone , placing Kirk in a position that might have damaged his career as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Kirk , who takes Spock 's treachery as a personal betrayal ; it is only Spock 's insistence that he was trying to protect Kirk from the death penalty by refusing to share his plans that brings Kirk around after Kirk has undergone the agonizing process of condemning Spock by finding him guilty . <p> Certain elements of " The Menagerie " are enshrined forever in Star Trek lore : the green-skinned dancer ( who is , in fact , Pike 's fantasy of an Orion slave girl rather a real Orion woman ) , Spock smiling at the chiming plants on Talos and shouting , " THE WOMEN !

I think it 's going to take somebody like that . <p> Trek Nation : Do you think Star Trek needs a break right now ? Or does your husband , as a Trekkie ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : They 're always coming out with something else . He 's searching for something to take its place , but nothing really takes its place . <p> Trek Nation : Does he watch Battlestar Galactica ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : No . He is just a Trekkie . I used to think he was a sci fi guy , which he sort of is , but truly it 's Star Trek . <p> Trek Nation : Do you keep in touch with any of the people from the show ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Avery Brooks and my little Cirroc Lofton . When you create a family on television , you kind of become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those are my Avery stories ! <p> Trek Nation : Have you followed Kasidy 's development in the Pocket Books ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Somebody educated me about it . If I had known all the history and all that stuff , she might have been different . I think there 's such a thing as too much information for the actor . <p> Trek Nation : Did you know the Maquis storyline was coming ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Let me tell you , when I saw that word in the script , because my husband was there , and I said , ' And the Marquis ... ' And he said , ' How do you spell that ? ' And I looked at him and said , ' It 's Marquis . ' And he said , oh no ! I 'm thinking I 'm going into a building or something . My husband had to sit me down and explain it to me . Prior to that , the writers were really good ; I was doing The Larry Sanders Show so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what the story might be . They did say that she might be going to jail , and I 'm thinking , I guess I 'm finished with Star Trek . But it 's the best going to jail I 've ever played , I 'm telling you ! Sherry had nothing on Kasidy when it comes to going to jail . She had her man by her side even though he 's the one who put her there ! <p> Trek Nation : Last time I talked to you , you were working on a theatre project , I think through your church . <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : I still am . We still are . We just did a huge fundraiser for the Katrina victims . I wrote a piece based on that , and what we did with those funds was , we gave them to families . We did n't send a check ; families were relocated in Los Angeles and one Sunday some of them were invited to our church home , and they were given checks on the spot . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims . They did n't know that monies were going to be given to them , they did n't know who was going to benefit from this , whether they were given to the American Red Cross ... when the pastor asked them to stand up and they were handed checks , that was very sweet . <p> And Gralin and I have completed his album - it 's released on March 1st - and we have almost finished my CD . Mine is not music , however , there is music attached to it ; mine is a voice and speech workout CD . Which I have done for over 20 years . I put a program together many , many years ago and decided , if people keep asking me for this , then let me get it ready for them . Actors , lawyers , public speakers , those who find themselves in the pulpit , those who just find themselves speaking will see results . Not just hear results : you will actually see results on your body . That 's the fun part ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most excited about 400 Years ; that 's my husband 's CD . I could just marry him 400 times over just because of the music . It 's so beautiful , and so close to the heart . <p> Trek Nation : Now , are you dead on 24 now ? For real ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : You know what , the spiritual side of me , let me get a little deep here , never wants to say dead . I was wounded , and you never saw my funeral . On television you 're never dead unless you see the body ! However , 24 is in my past . As it is in a lot of people 's pasts . This is supposed to be the last season . They 've been talking about a movie since the first season , and they were saying , would it be a movie before , when David was a Senator ? <p> Trek Nation : So David and Sherry could be back ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : The Palmers and 24 just go together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different show . I have to tell you , I was mortified that Leslie ceased working after the first year . I thought it was ingenious of them to kill off a character like that , however , I am a working actor and I love when other actors work . The bad side is that you have a friend who is no longer on a show , and that 's not usually the way it 's done in Hollywood . I do n't know if it 's financial reasons , or ratings . What happens in the television setting when you have a lead actor , you have a Kiefer Sutherland , you do n't want him to be married . You want him to be a player because you want every woman out there to be able to fantasize about him , you know ? That 's part of good television . That 's why soaps are so popular . Even if they 're married , they 're all having affairs ! For some reason we are just really immoral people ! We like that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for : Star Trek or 24 ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Sometimes I try to guess , when I can see someone who 's ready to come over and I need to let them know whether it 's okay to come over or , ' Right now I 'm dealing with my daughter , do n't do that . ' And I 'm not right ... it 's almost always not what I think it is . I think they see Sherry Palmer over here and it 's Beverly from The Larry Sanders Show . And then I think they see Beverly and it 's Kasidy Yates . And kids love the Disney movies . So I never know . I ca n't guess anymore . Except when I hear words associated with characters ... if it 's the B word , I know it 's Sherry Palmer ! <p> Trek Nation : What would you like to do next ? Would you rather be playing a role model or is it just too much fun to play the B word ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to be doing this new series where I get to let women of age just enjoy themselves onscreen . How wicked or how wonderful we are at that certain age ! <p> Trek Nation : You do n't look like you 're at that certain age . <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : But I do have a 23 year old ! A lot of people ask me about playing Condoleezza Rice , because I 'm actually playing her again . They ask political questions which I do n't really have answers to because I am of a different politics than Condoleezza . But I find myself madly in love with her just from playing her . <p> Trek Nation : Did you get feedback from her or anyone connected with her ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Absolutely -- the last movie I just finished , which will be out in May , playing Condi , the former senator from New Jersey came up and kept staring at me and he said , ' Condi is not going to believe this . I keep looking at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here with us . ' We decided to take a picture in the White House on the set together , and he said , ' When I show this to the president , he 's going to say , ' Our secret is out ! ' I took that to mean , Condi 's running the country ! <p> Trek Nation : Maybe you could trade places with her and run the country differently . <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : I thought , ' I should put this on my web site . ' There 's Condoleezza sitting behind the desk ! People do ask me questions about getting into the White House , because they know Sherry was desperate to get into the White House and playing Condoleezza , who is in the White House and probably is running the White House . A lot of people who know the family side of me want to know little things about marriage and how it works , being in Hollywood , and I welcome those personal questions .

That has all the DS9 writers . <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : It was this time last year and that 's why I wanted to do it . But the offer came , and I would not have finished shooting the season until September . That 's when my mother in law was diagnosed , and I really thought that I would be blessed more saying no to a gig than , after this whole thing , having any kind of guilt or suffering from wondering , ' Why was that more important than a life ?

' and ' Why has there never been a gay crewmember ? ' <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Yes , and those are the interesting questions ! I think that you have to first define gay . Is it a sexual preference or something ... I asked a friend recently , because I thought this friend was gay , and my friend said , ' Oh , but I 'm not gay , ' and I said oh , then I do n't know what gay is . As far as Star Trek , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you do n't know , is a male a male in another galaxy ? <p> Trek Nation : Is Odo male ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : Yes . It 's a unisex kind of thing . I think we already have that going on in Star Trek , if we are going to say that this is our human way of thinking about how that lifestyle is . But I do n't know ! I 've had people tell me and had to say , ' I stand corrected . You know more than I do . ' <p> Trek Nation : And what do you think the next Star Trek should be ? <p> Penny Johnson Jerald : I think you have so many rich stories and untapped stories with the Star Treks that have already come and gone .

So why have the Prophets moved him forward in timeand why have They brought him and Kira together ? " <p> The Review : <p> This story follows on from previous books of Georges ( Sacraments of Fire , Ascendance , etc. ) so its a continuation of a story that has been in progress and not truly a standalone . There are frequent references to previous events and while the story can be read without having read the other books , obviously the reader will get more out of the story by having read prior books . <p> There are two main stories here . One is about Vedek Kira Nerys , the newly-arrived Altek Dans and conflict between two religious factions on Bajor after a discovery deep beneath the surface of Endalla , one of Bajors moons . Kira must walk a fine line between the two factions so that civil war does not break out on Bajor . <p> This task is complicated by Kiras own firm belief in the Prophets , her hazy memories of the life and love she experienced after she vanished into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kiras old prejudice against Kai Winn which makes her begin to distrust the new Kai Pralon . <p> Altek , seemingly brought to Bajor from its distant past , has a hand in the proceedings , literally .

Back in her quarters , she picks up a religious book and looks for the chapter " Faith and Love . " As she begins to read the text , an unexpected but very welcome visitor arrives . The Prophets , often enigmatic , seem to have been aware of and answered Kiras unspoken need . <p> The other story in The Long Mirage is about the disappearance of Morn and Quarks quest to find the Lurian .

Vic is able to return to his singing career , but his rescue comes with a cost to the hologram . <p> The Verdict : <p> I liked the book .

Ro Larens selfishness and her desire to avoid unpleasantness caused pain to Quark . Kiras bad experiences with Kai Winn began to affect how she related to Kai Pralon and she had to struggle to be fair and to not let her prejudice overwhelm her . <p> Not having read the previous books , I did n't  really buy into the previous romance between Altek Dans and Kira and so his attempts to rekindle that annoyed me . <p> Deep Space Nine did n't  always give happy endings ; not on the televised series and not in this book .

@@58304329 @7304329/ <h> Too Short a Season <p> Plot Summary : When Federation members are taken hostage on Mordan IV , the Enterprise is ordered to ferry Admiral Mark Jameson to negotiate with planetary leader Karnas for their release . Jameson known Karnas from past dealings and insists that he will command the mission , which both Picard and Crusher find troubling because the admiral is both extremely i 'll and erratic in his behavior . However , Jameson soon seems healthier and in fact appears to be younger , foregoing his wheelchair and taking on the appearance of a man half a decade younger than his age . When his wife and Picard both demand an explanation , he explains that he took a double dose of a controversial alien de-aging treatment , which is making him grow young twice as fast but is also making his condition unstable . The reason for his desperation is that 40 years earlier , when Karnas took hostages and demanded Starfleet weapons , Jameson met his demands and armed the other side as well in a misreading of the Prime Directive that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge , but when he sees the admiral in the throes of agonizing death as his body tries to return to childhood , he agrees with Picard that the past is over and the hostages should be freed . <p> Analysis : " Too Short a Season " is n't one of The Next Generation 's best-executed episodes , but it has a solid premise that would have fit in on the original series and good acting from the regulars and a young guest star buried under what has to have been one of the more difficult makeup jobs to work with on the series . Clayton Rohner enters the venerable position of Evil Admiral here - how many times was Kirk forced to take a senior officer aboard , only to have his mission sabotaged by the very expert who was supposed to be saving the day ? In this case Jameson 's perfidy is internal as well as external , for not only did he make a mistake and lie to Starfleet at the cost of millions of lives , but he sabotaged his own integrity , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Commodore Decker in " The Doomsday Machine " , he wants to relive the past and get it right this time , but he 's obviously a bit mad and refusing to accept assistance from the Starfleet captain who has the same goals in mind . <p> The hostage storyline and the medical miracle storyline never quite come together , which is frustrating because the latter gets short shrift both scientifically and ethically . For how long have people been searching for a way to take years off their aging bodies ? Jameson abuses the magical formula he has been given by grateful aliens , taking his wife 's dose as well as his own , but what 's lost in his suffering from this overdose is that the formula works . Works ! I do n't care how enlightened the people of the 24th century are : there are still those who would kill for this . Probably not Beverly Crusher , who can see first-hand the toll it takes on the body , nor Deanna Troi , who can see first-hand the toll it takes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enterprise who can see Jameson and what 's happening to him . There must be hundreds of more interesting stories than the dragged-out hostage drama that this Fountain of Youth fable could have been a vehicle to tell . <p> But we get what we get , which is a not-unexpected revelation that the reason for the current crisis is Jameson 's bungling of a similar crisis decades earlier , resulting in a scenario much like the one Kirk seemed to know he was setting up in " A Private Little War " : what happens when you arm both sides equally is not usually stalemate followed by peace negotiations , but stealth attacks , terrorism , resentment , reprisals , as much all-out warfare as can be waged at any given time . Clearly Jameson is not a student of history . It 's a bit hard to root for him , both because of this short-sightedness ( and the many , many years he has spent covering up his actions ) and because of his testosterone-addled solution : take a drug , march in and solve everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be young again , enjoying sex again , feeling like a man again ( " I was useless to you , " he tells his still-aged wife , who had been looking forward to a quiet retirement ) . It 's not a terrible human drama but it only barely touches on the myriad of issues raised by becoming young again and getting to do it all over . <p> For much of the episode , actor Clayton Rohner is stuck trying to emote through many layers of not-the-best aging makeup , which definitely hampers his plausibility and forces him to overact while the admiral is supposed to be over 60 . Once he 's playing in his own body , the performance becomes more modulated , but then both Karnas and the actor playing him seem over-the-top by comparison , which would n't be a problem in a Kirk-era villain but makes Karnas ' sudden renunciation of his revenge and willingness to negotiate without a grimace quite implausible . Not just Jameson but the entire Federation is arguably as responsible for the civil war as the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some responsibility ; fine , but how is it possible that no one at Starfleet noticed enough missing weapons to wage wide-scale war , nor checked up on the planet after Jameson left with the hostages ? ( Yeah , the US did n't check up on Iran much after the Ayatollah shipped off the hostages in 1980 , but Picard 's in the 24th century , and as we 've seen has better , safer ways of dealing with such messy situations . ) <p> Against the backdrop of such messy politics , what could have been a compelling human story gets lost . We do n't have time to explore Jameson 's guilt and self-condemnation because he must spend too much time simply convincing Karnas that his newly-young body is really him ; we do n't have time to explore the effects on his marriage because his wife sounds rather selfish whimpering that she just wanted a quiet retirement while people are in mortal danger on the planet below . Like the dead end that Jameson leads the away team into , which wastes valuable time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle out of them instead of progressing . <p> All the same , " Too Short a Season " retains enough of an original series feel to be enjoyable , and there 's a lovely balance among the cast , perhaps because in this episode about artificial youth , Wesley Crusher is kept far out of the way . I wish that in a later story , someone had dropped in on that mysterious planet where Jameson found the secret to reliving his youth . There 's a terrific story to be told in there .

Watts , the pair named co-star Jonathan Frakes ( Riker ) as their favourite director and expressed their frustration with Star Trek Nemesis director Stuart Baird , whom Burton said had bragged about not having done any research from the episodes to see what had worked previously . When Watts mentioned that the film had done poorly at the box office , Burton declared , " That 's because it sucked !

" <p> When asked about another recent Star Trek installment that was less than a success among fans , Sirtis said that when she appeared in the Enterprise finale , " Personally I thought it was a good episode ; I just did n't think it was a good last episode . " Was the problem the script for " These Are the Voyages " ? The actress did n't think so . " To be honest , and I think LeVar would agree with me on this , we read many scripts that sucked , right ?

Our friend Geordi would come visit , and wacky uncle Data , and we 'd have our little dog Worf . " Reminded that her character had had an affair with that little dog , Sirtis moaned , " Do n't remind me ! " <p> While Sirtis said that she would still be on TNG if she could , " though not LeVar because he 's a big-time director " , she made gagging gestures at a question about whether it was true the next Star Trek feature film would be a prequel .

Not only did he have a great sense of humor , he had a very peculiar work ethic : we never worked past 5 o'clock because Jimmy started drinking at 4:45 . He will be missed . " <p> These days Burton prefers directing to acting . He explained that as a director he needs " to be concerned with the entire thing " , not just his own lines , which is where actors tend to focus .

After Captain Jellico ordered her to wear a proper Starfleet uniform , said Sirtis , " Not that they ever listened to me , but I wanted to stay in my spacesuit ; it made me feel like really part of the crew . I had somewhere to put my pips ... where were they before , tattooed on my ass ? " She added as an aside to the men in the audience that they were " pathetic " for the way Voyager 's ratings increased after Jeri Ryan ( Seven of Nine ) joined the series .

" she said . " Until you brought it up it did n't even occur to me . " She added that Roddenberry 's response whenever anyone asked why there were n't any gay characters on Star Trek was , " How do you know ? He thought should be non-issue . " <p> Burton recalled that the network did not want Roddenberry to have a black woman , a Russian , an Asian and an alien together on the bridge , but said that the creator had fought for it , insisting that the Enterprise reflected the world in that people are all in it together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , " he added when asked whether a show like the new Battlestar Galactica might be more relevant in a post-9/11 world .

The captain and science officer successfully convince Tucker to lower his weapon , allowing T'Pol to stun him and inoculate the entire away team .

It 's sort of a merger between the Classic Trek episodes ' The Naked Time ' and ' This Side of Paradise ' crossed with DS9 's ' Dramatis Personae ' and ' The Voyager Conspiracy , ' yet manages to be creepier than the former and wittier than the latter . This is mostly due to a fantastic performance by Connor Trinneer , who owns this episode ; he manages to play believable insanity without sacrificing either his authoritative demeanor or his comic timing . For this reason alone , ' Strange New World ' is easily my favorite Enterprise episode so far . <p> We get introduced to some " lower decks " crewmembers , Elizabeth Cutler and Ethan Novakovich , who manage not to become red-shirts , meaning that we might actually see them again .

His most endearing moment comes when he worries about the ethics of squashing a scorpion-type creature that has crawled into Tucker 's sleeping bag . I 'm not really complaining , because the sparks between Archer , T'Pol and Tucker have provided most of the great scenes in previous episodes , but I 'd like to see the supporting cast given stronger roles or at least more memorable dialogue . <p> Archer seems to have learned something from ' Fight or Flight ' when he expresses concern about beaming down into someone 's backyard , but goes on to demonstrate typical foolhardiness when he sends down an away team without decent planetary surveys -- and takes his dog with him ! Too bad Porthos is n't exposed to the spores ; I 'd love to know whether paranoid dogs envision cats or doorbells no one else can hear .

OK , I wo n't go there . We get a brief , terrifying Final Frontier flashback as the crew sits around the campfire , but they do n't sing , and T'Pol keeps her distance . She sounds more Vulcan in ' Strange New World , ' partly because we finally get some contrast with her uncontrolled side when she starts snapping at Tucker in the cave . Her recommendations seem muted , less focused on making Archer look like a fool and more on protecting their crew . And since she makes the very silly suggestion to remain overnight on the planet she wanted to spend a week surveying from space , their relationship seems more balanced . <p> The paranoia develops nicely because we view the rock creatures from the point of view of the crewmembers before we know their faculties have been compromised . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're inclined to believe Cutler when she says she saw T'Pol talking to mysterious aliens . I 'm still uncomfortable with the level of Vulcan-baiting on this series , but maybe the point is to suggest to us that we 'll accept irrational suggestions over Vulcan logic . However , the effect is undercut when we see paranormal events with our own eyes . But hey , we get to see the Vulcan neck pinch , even if she does perform it upside down and backwards , so Vulcans must be cool after all , right ? <p> While we 're on the subject of racial difference , though , I want to ask a question . How come Enterprise -- whose crew is overwhelmingly human -- has an alien doctor managing sickbay without a single human serving as backup during a crisis ? A human M.D. might not realize that the psychotropic drug contains a variant deadly to humans any more quickly than Phlox does , but Phlox 's uncertainty about whether T'Pol might be affected does n't inspire confidence in him .

Archer needs a bigger sickbay staff . <p> His first officer , however , needs no improvement . I love the scene where Archer asks Tucker to remember the time the latter got nitrogen narcosis and tried to take off his helmet in zero-gee . " Trust me now , " the captain begs , and we see the struggle on Tucker 's face -- but then the good ole boy asserts himself and declares that he wo n't die with a hypospray in his hand , forcing Archer and T'Pol to do some pretty clever acting . It 's even funnier that Archer sort of makes up the Horta decades before Kirk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rocks and that was also initially dismissed as a hallucination . <p> Tucker -- who 's going to have lots of preconceptions challenged in next week 's episode if the previews are any indication -- manages to regain his senses and his dignity in time to admit that his distrust of T'Pol stems from a bad high school experience with a Vulcan teacher who threatened his world view . That 's a better explanation for prejudice than the knee-jerk reactions exhibited by many of the other humans on the series so far , though it 's nice to know he 's already growing out of it . Trinneer 's obviously having a lot of fun with the role yet taking it entirely seriously at appropriate moments . And in truth , the part of me that still despises T'Pol 's catsuit , curved eyebrows and sexpot demeanor was quietly rooting for Tucker to shoot her , though she 's growing on me . <p> Even though I like him , I know Tucker 's on the show to appeal to same demographic as T'Pol .

Kirk finds a girl , Miri , hiding in a closet and discovers from her that all the " grups " died after becoming violent ; he also discovers that he and the other members of the landing party are infected with the same contagious pathogen . While Spock and McCoy go through the research notes of long-dead doctors , discovering a life prolongation project gone horribly awry , Kirk and Janice Rand try to contact the children , who have lived for hundreds of years in terror of the agony and death that arrives with adolescence . One of the older boys plots to get rid of the Enterprise crewmembers by stealing their communicators and keeping them from contacting the ship , but Miri discovers that she is developing the disease and works with Kirk to find them . While they are gone , McCoy tests his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing the others to convince the children to trust them . The crew leaves behind a medical team and a promise of teachers , farmers and other " grups " to come help rebuild . <p> Analysis : In classic horror stories and films , attempts to reverse death or live forever always come to horrible ends - people suffer so grotesquely that dying seems far less scary than its alternative . " Miri " is a cautionary tale about such an effort , but it 's also a lovely character story and contains one of the better-developed female guest stars to interact with James T. Kirk . Miri may be jealous of Kirk 's attentions to Rand , but she ca n't realize how lucky she is to be too young to serve as a love interest . Though she receives intimations of Kirk 's charming machinations when he uses her attention to gain information or access to the other children , Miri is in some ways treated as more of an equal than most of the women Kirk encounters during dangerous missions , and it 's impressive how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's striking how much more complex Miri seems than Rand , whose screaming , crying , mothering the children and trying to get Kirk to look at her legs seem painfully clichTd by contrast . This woman is a professional on a starship , yet her reaction to the probability of decay and death is to lament her lost beauty while Kirk is agonizing over his crew and McCoy and Spock are struggling with the medical conundrum of the disease . Kirk displays little personal emotional reaction to learning that he will probably die within a week : his concern is focused outward on his ship and crew , making certain that no additional personnel risk contact with the disease and facing the additional horror of the discovery that all the children on the planet will starve if they are unable to cure the disease and contact " Space Central " ( as it is called in this episode ) to assist . Spock , who never becomes infected and taunts McCoy about the advantages of having green blood , is concerned not about death but being abandoned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to the ship , and he is the first to notice when their communicators disappear . <p> Kirk states his opinion that children have an innate longing for adults to teach them right from wrong , for which there is n't a lot of evidence in the episode ; John , the oldest surviving boy among the " Onlies " , is bossy and disinterested , while Miri 's interest in Kirk stems from a more selfish motive than the desire to be taught by him . The violent possessiveness of a dying adolescent at the beginning of the episode , clinging to a tricycle that clearly has n't worked for years and clearly was too small for him for years before that , is unnerving not because the Enterprise crew is ever in danger from him but because it is all too easy to imagine what the older Onlies might have done to the younger ones . The boy who plays schoolteacher and leads the others in beating Kirk demonstrates both a penchant and skill for violence learned not from the long-absent Grups , but probably from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she proposes to put to Rand about who takes care of the littlest Onlies when they 're sick or injured . <p> " Miri " does a lovely , subtle job exploring the fantasy/horror of childhood without any adults . On the surface , it 's all " foolies " , as the Onlies call fun and games . But all the toys are rusting and broken and none of the 300-year-old children quite remembers the rules of Teacher or Policeman beyond the possibility of " bonk , bonk on the head " for misbehaving . Despite their attempts to hurt the invading Grups , these appear to be fairly kind children who support the youngest and weakest rather than leaving them to suffer , but there are also relatively few of them in the city , and one suspects that their dreamlike elongated youth with no boring education and no strict adult guidelines must have a much darker side than the episode depicts . The details of the horrors when the Grups from the planet became i 'll are vague , but from Miri 's terrified reaction to the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried the adults , and what happened to the nursing infants and unsupervised toddlers ? I do n't even want to imagine the history of this Neverland - as Kirk tells Rand , the dream is not very pretty . <p> But of course , adolescence is the true nightmare on this duplicate Earth , sending children into a degenerative state that causes pain , physical distortion , madness and death . Going through puberty without any adults around must be confusing enough : the moment the landing party arrives and she realizes that they are n't going to hurt her , Miri instantly gravitates toward them even though she is given petty tasks to do like sharpening pencils and she ca n't read the complex notes they must decipher to try to cure the disease . Kirk understands her feelings before she does herself and must be the one to break the news , not only that she is becoming a woman , but that that process will kill her if she does n't help them reverse the legacy her parents and their peers left behind .

The power of this scene is undercut later when Shatner tries to explain the same situation to a gang of taunting kids - " No blah blah blah ! " he shouts in one of the episode 's painfully comic moments , double-daring the Onlies to return the black boxes they use to talk to the ship . Yet Shatner is quite effective laying out the scenario to follow : " If you do n't help us there wo n't be any games anymore . There wo n't be anything . No Grups , no Onlies . Nobody left . Forever . " The fact that the kids smirk does n't detract from the chill . <p> McCoy has a very powerful moment injecting himself with the antidote that Spock has said might be " a beaker full of death . " It 's hard to know , with only hours left , whether he makes this choice because he is beginning to go mad , because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found the cure and this is the only way to prove it to Spock , thus saving Kirk and the others , but it 's a brave and dramatic gesture that earns him a rare expression of admiration from Spock , veiled beneath the comment that he will never understand the medical mind . The trio has some fine moments in " Miri " particularly as the situation deteriorates , with Kirk ranting about his crew , McCoy ranting about how Kirk is n't a doctor and Spock trying to impose logic on the extremely tense situation . McCoy and Spock work particularly well together in the crisis , even finishing one another 's sentences while they speculate on how the disease came to be and how it works . There are some funny first-season quirks - a parallel Earth that has the same continents with no explanation of how it came to be , the absence of the Federation as a resource - plus one of McCoy 's earliest " He 's dead , Jim , " moments and a tag in which Kirk makes a joke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a game without rules , and the early structures that made Star Trek unforgettable are already coalescing here .

Leila , a scientist of Spock 's acquaintance , introduces him to a plant that generates intense pleasure and tranquility in those infested by its spores . Spock declares his love for Leila and his intention to remain on the planet ; soon afterward , McCoy is infested as well and beams up dozens of the plants to the Enterprise , where the entire crew is affected and mutinies to join the colony . At first resistant , Kirk ultimately succumbs to the spores , but when he contemplates leaving the Enterprise forever , his wrenching emotional response breaks their hold on him . Requesting that Spock beam up to help him transport equipment , Kirk picks a fight with the Vulcan and then the two build a sonic device to sow irritation and anger among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the spores ' influence , he recognizes that his agricultural colony has made little progress and tells Kirk that they wish to relocate . <p> Analysis : Famous - or perhaps infamous - as a rare " Spock in love " episode , " This Side of Paradise " serves as a peculiar sort of cautionary tale . It 's on fine if familiar ground when it seems like a don't-do-drugs episode , with Spock telling Leila that there 's no such thing as a happiness pill and the entire crew then falling victim to what 's obviously an addictive psychotropic chemical in the spores . But then , at the end , Kirk 's speech on how man is n't meant to live in paradise veers off into some weirdness about how humans have to fight and claw their way up , and the whole episode gets cast in rather uncomfortable light as a result . What happened to " We can admit that we 're barbarians but we 're not going to kill today " ? In that light , when Leila turns on Spock 's insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for her , she seems quite sympathetic , and Kirk and Spock rather cruel . <p> This is another instance of Kirk imposing his will about how people should live upon others - not unfairly , as in " The Return of the Archons " and " A Taste of Armageddon " , since his crew has been influenced by an alien plant and his ship and mission are at risk . But he is n't content to take back what 's his , or even follow Starfleet orders . He is strongly judgmental of the lifestyle of the colonists , who are n't making progress according to his definition of human advancement . There 's no reflection upon the value of the contemplative life , living in harmony with nature , people producing only what they need and sharing equally in tasks ; of course it 's artificial , since these people are living in a place where animals can not survive , in a symbiotic relationship of sorts with alien spores , but the episode is overwhelmingly judgmental of " backward " lifestyles and reasoning . Spock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that maybe he should stop to look at clouds in the future . Not until Star Trek : The Motion Picture will he again verbalize the question , " Is this all I am ? " <p> It is , of course , entirely possible that I am overthinking the meaning of the episode , for much of " This Side of Paradise " is an entertaining lark . Spock gets sprayed with spores , makes out with a pretty blonde , hangs from a tree , calls Kirk " Jim " in front of everyone and announces he has no intention of following his orders , though he sincerely hopes Kirk will join him in his newfound happiness ... meanwhile McCoy reverts to the Southern accent of his youth , goes off to make mint juleps and refuses to poke into the miracle of a population with regenerative powers , while Sulu walks around blissfully studying plants and Uhura gleefully short-circuits the console that requires her to keep a receiver in her ear . It 's entertaining to watch their giddy smiles , and even more amusing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees with him when he announces that the man 's desertion is mutiny . <p> The piFce de resistance is the fight into which Kirk goads Spock , trying to make the Vulcan angry enough to overwhelm the influence of the spores , which he has already logged may be quite dangerous . " All right , you mutinous , disloyal , computerized half-breed , we 'll see about you deserting my ship , " he announces , brandishing a pipe . Spock blinks at him and answers in his utterly endearing , logical style that half-breed may be applicable , but he 's not computerized - he 's a man - to which Kirk , who 's just getting warmed up , demands , " What makes you think you 're a man ? " He then proceeds to slur his best friend 's parentage , his brain , his " planet of traitors " - here Spock asks Kirk to stop - and the fact that he is disloyal , subhuman , and , worst , making love to a human girl . Either Kirk has spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , or he 's a little more needled than he 'd like to admit to see his first officer hanging from trees , giggling and smooching ... perhaps he 's jealous that Leila never gave the legendary Kirk physique a second glance , or perhaps he 's jealous that any woman could touch Spock emotionally in a way he ca n't . <p> In any event , he manages to get Spock riled up enough to smack him around , one of the more entertaining fight sequences of the entire series . Then , when Spock has shaken off the effects of the spores , Kirk congratulates himself on having gotten under that thick hide and Spock on having gotten away with belting his captain ; Spock is concerned that perhaps they should both be in the brig , since striking a fellow officer is a court-martial offense , but Kirk defuses this with his usual triumphant humor and Spock concedes that it would be more logical to worry about deprogramming the rest of the crew . What strikes me about the latter part of this scene , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly still feeling strong emotions : he 's remorseful , he 's embarrassed , and Kirk is very attuned to this fact . He 's also worried about Spock talking to Leila afterward , even though Spock is ostensibly free from passion for her . <p> Curiously , Leila seems not to notice when Spock 's rejection drives the spores from her that he is still fighting his feelings . ( She has her back to him - a lovely bit of directing , so the audience can see her face and Spock 's without a cut . ) He is sorry for her pain , but she is n't really hearing him when he says , " I am what I am , Leila " - he never agrees with her that he is incapable of giving of himself , in fact he proves her wrong a moment later when he brushes the tears from her face , but she wants him on her own emotional terms , and that is alien to him . She is manipulative - Spock says rather peevishly to her before he is affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to avoid direct answers to questions - and yet she is sympathetic , showing Spock and the viewer a side of him that is n't entirely spore-generated . <p> There 's quite a lot else to like in the episode - McCoy , for one thing , wryly telling Kirk that it 's pure speculation and just an educated guess , but he 'd say that Sandoval is alive , later insisting that he did not say he wished Spock would mellow a little when we 've all heard him say things much stronger than that , and still later assuring Kirk in country doctor style that he 's got everything taken care of while he cheerily beams plants to the ship . There 's also quite a bit of pathos in Kirk fighting for his ship - Lenore is right in " The Conscience of the King " that at this stage no lover can compete with a starship , though it 's interesting how much that will change , how Kirk will sacrifice the Enterprise with scarcely a second thought in The Search for Spock . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , at least for a little while , in the Nexus , but here it 's not so much the artificial means of achieving inner bliss that he finds problematic - and it is problematic , in a place where no animals can thrive , where we see no children or creative growth .

He explains that on the way to Azati Prime , the ship encountered another trans-dimensional disturbance and he put all the humans in comas to protect their neocortexes because it would have taken weeks to go around the region otherwise . Because he is Denobulan , he is immune to the madness and death that would have afflicted the humans , so he is responsible for keeping the ship running for four days , following a nervous crash course by Tucker and others in keeping everything running in case the computer has a problem . <p> Phlox plays with Porthos , feeds his plants in the nude and has his own private movie night , but he becomes nervous when he hears sounds and thinks he 's seeing things .

In his panic , Phlox nearly shoots Porthos . <p> Ignoring the science officer 's recommendation that he rest , Phlox continues to make his rounds , imagining first that he sees a horribly deformed Sato blaming him for her suffering , then a wakened Archer saying that T'Pol warned him of Phlox 's hallucinations . Phlox knows that they are not real , but he is distressed to discover that he can not tell reality from illusion . He suggests turning the ship over to her and sedating himself , but T'Pol admits that she is on the verge of losing control of her emotions and says the crew is better off in Phlox 's hands . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it appears that the disturbance has expanded and Phlox decides that they must risk turning on the warp engines to escape . <p> T'Pol is helpless to assist , claiming that she can not focus , so Phlox reads the manual and after some initial trouble figures out how to close the plasma relays and generate a warp field . He believes that he sees Tucker coming to berate him , but manages to get the ship into warp , bolstering the hull plating as Reed taught him to do . Once clear of the disturbance , Phlox wakes Archer , who thanks him . Then he walks T'Pol to her quarters to sleep , only to discover that T'Pol is already in her quarters , in a coma ; the T'Pol with whom he has been conversing all this time has also been a delusion . Phlox wonders aloud to Dr. Lucas whether he should delete his entire letter but decides to keep it for entertainment purposes , and invites the real T'Pol to eat with him , telling her that the ship did n't feel nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected a rehash of Star Trek : Voyager 's strained haunted house episode " One " , so imagine my delight at getting instead a cross between A Beautiful Mind and The Sixth Sense , headlined by the two actors who seem never to make a wrong move on Enterprise no matter what sort of material they 're given . In this case , the material is derivative and it did n't take long for my kids , let alone for me , to figure out that T'Pol was n't really there ; but that discovery makes " Doctor 's Orders " a more interesting character study rather than a weak thriller , giving us insight into Phlox 's psyche with sympathy and wit . <p> Like " Dear Doctor " , one of Enterprise 's best episodes , " Doctor 's Orders " is structured as a letter narrated to a human friend familiar with Denobulan culture . Because of the format , the audience is able to see that Phlox may not be entirely stable long before he suspects . In two amusing scenes , he eats a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants with various props blocking body parts unsuitable for family television viewing ; there 's a particularly funny angle on a watering can , suggesting Denobulans may be phenomenally well-endowed . <p> By the time T'Pol turns up , we have reason to believe she may not be the genuine article . In fact , it 's a relief to have that confirmed after her display of utter incompetence in engineering during the episode 's climax . But just as John Nash 's imaginary roommate from A Beautiful Mind - a literature student - only ever lectures on Lady Chatterley 's Lover because it 's apparently the only English novel Nash can recall , T'Pol can only know as much as Phlox knows about any given system of the ship . When she orders Phlox to check the long-range sensors , it 's a pretty obvious giveaway that this is n't the real science officer ; the genuine T'Pol could read sensors no matter how emotional she got , even while having a fling with Tucker or something . <p> It 's delightful to see Phlox 's personal impressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unlike nearly everyone else , he does n't treat her as particularly exotic whether she 's utterly Vulcan in her repression of emotion or more like the humans around her . In fact , seeing T'Pol through Phlox 's eyes is quite enlightening : even unbalanced and terrified of Xindi , he takes her expertise for granted and allows her to question his competence with basic equipment , though later when he visualizes Archer and Tucker , they 're more intimidating figures - the one condescending , the other very nearly threatening . Phlox 's depth of esteem for T'Pol is obviously quite deep , and for once when he dances around the subject of romance , making oblique reference to the irrationality of Commander Tucker , he seems not voyeuristic but like a potential confidant . <p> It 's also obvious that Archer 's trust means a great deal to Phlox and he is determined not to let him down , nor to risk anyone 's life by prematurely ending the coma state even though he desperately needs help in engineering . It 's endearing to watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never seen him bond with the captain . It 's also curious to see how little he changes when left entirely alone ; unlike the Starfleet officers , who act very differently on duty and in their off-hours , Phlox 's personality hardly alters beyond quirks that might be caused by the spatial distortion . <p> The haunted house atmosphere , dim corridors and empty rooms , gets mitigated by the understanding that most of the threats are inside Phlox 's mind - if there were really Xindi running around the ship , as T'Pol logically points out , they 'd have to have boarded somehow or beamed on , there would be evidence . Thus it all feels rather domestic , even when we 're looking at Phlox and T'Pol through an overhead fisheye lens ( one of several lovely shots by director Roxann Dawson ) . The threat to the crew comes from the same source as their salvation , for Phlox 's real fear is that he 'll go insane and somehow get everyone killed , but like Archer , we know him enough to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost-story bits , like a subtle reference to William Shatner 's Twilight Zone episode " Nightmare at 20,000 Feet " with the " creature " outside the ship and references to Tucker having shown The Exorcist , do n't really distract from the fact that we 're watching The Sixth Sense with the same dead giveaways : T'Pol ca n't operate the machinery , Tucker does n't acknowledge her presence in the last scene . I 'm not quite sure about his own personal movie night choice , which I 'm fairly certain is the 1949 production of A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur 's Court , other than the fact that he has to take on many different roles and feels out of place among humans , but that seems to have changed somewhat by the end , anyway . ( Addendum : I 've been told that it 's Danny Kaye 's The Court Jester . Same comment applies . ) <p> In short , there 's very little to praise in terms of the sci-fi of " Doctor 's Orders " but as bottle shows go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice break from the Xindi action storyline while still moving the ship forward on its quest . And unlike " One " which allowed the character who always saved the ship to save it once more , this time we got to see an unlikely hero do the job .

But I 'm not sorry that this job goes to Billingsley and Blalock : they take it and run with it with great style .

Thanks a lot , Deanna ! Logan is inconsistent , first insisting that LaForge needs to protect the crew , then objecting to LaForge 's apparent plan to abandon the away team , but LaForge ends up acquitting himself nicely with the help of Worf and a woman at the helm who quickly disappears from the series .

It 's kind of silly how Riker gets caught in the energy field : Picard tells Riker to signal to beam up , rather than simply telling the helm or transporter room to get Riker out of there now as Kirk would have done . The end of the episode is rather pat and a bit confusing , since it involves Picard negotiating with a hologram at the same time LaForge is trying to fight his way back to stage a rescue .

She really does n't come across as a very strong chief of security - ca n't stop the captain from beaming down into an extremely dangerous situation , ca n't disarm the drones without Data 's help , and does n't seem any more knowledgeable about the nature of the weapons systems they 're facing than any of the other away team members while the engineers on the ship make better guesses .

And since Crusher spends most of this episode pretending to have the shakes and falling asleep , it 's not like the other women are outshining Yar .

@@58304373 @7304373/ <p> Many Star Trek fans have long hoped for some type of resolution to the relationship between Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Dr. Beverly Crusher . The new novel Death In Winter by Michael Jan Friedman aims to resolve their relationship once and for all and it succeeds in doing so in a way that I suspect will leave most fans feeling quite satisfied . <p> The remainder of this review will contain MAJOR SPOILERS for Death In Winter , so if you do n't want details , stop reading right now . <p> Jean-Luc Picard has been in love with Beverly Crusher for over thirty years . Remorseful about harboring such strong feelings for the wife of a close friend and reluctant to jeopardize their own friendship , Picard learned to bury his feelings for Beverly long ago .

The Romulan Empire is at a critical juncture . The death of Shinzon , following his assassination of most of Romulus 's political leadership , has left the Empire in chaos as various factions via for control and the Empire 's subject worlds grow restless .

Several characters , most notably Picard 's former Stargazer colleagues , fulfill their roles but they do n't add to the story .

@@58304376 @7304376/ <h> The Empath <p> Plot Summary : When the Enterprise arrives at Minara to collect a research team just before the star goes supernova , a landing party consisting of Kirk , Spock and McCoy is stranded when a radiation surge threatens the ship . The officers can not track down the researchers and are soon abducted themselves by two aliens from a race called the Vians , who imprison them together with a mute empath whom McCoy calls Gem . When torture by the Vians leaves Kirk injured , she heals his wounds . The Vians then demand that Kirk choose either Spock or McCoy as another test subject , warning that McCoy is likely to die and Spock is likely to go mad . Because Kirk is still in pain , McCoy gives him an injection to help him sleep , leaving Spock in command ; when Spock says that he will be going with the Vians , McCoy gives him a shot as well and tells the Vians that he has been chosen for their experiment . Kirk and Spock track down McCoy , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gem to heal him because they want to see whether her species is deserving of salvation when the star they share explodes . Gem offers to give her life to save McCoy but he will not permit it , and Kirk persuades the Vians that because of her willingness to die for another , Gem 's people should be saved and McCoy as well . <p> Analysis : I 'm not going to try to argue that " The Empath " is a good episode ; it has too many similarities to " The Menagerie " and the set looks less minimalist than unfinished , like the producers could n't be bothered to come up with enough of a budget to create a believable background . That said , I adore " The Empath " unreservedly and it 's on my Top Five list , though it is n't nearly as nuanced or sophisticated as " Amok Time " , " The Enterprise Incident " , " Journey To Babel " and " The City on the Edge of Forever . " I choke up every time I watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCoy were Gem 's teachers : " Your will to survive , your love of life , your passion to know , they are recorded in her being ... each of you was willing to give his life for the others . " But I think my favorite moment in the entire series may be the one earlier in the episode , when Spock has just informed McCoy of his purportedly logical decision that he , Spock , will be going to probable death to save the other two , and Gem walks over to touch him , proving with one look the extent to which Spock 's claim to have no emotions is a lie . <p> This is an episode that could easily have fallen apart if the performances were not spot-on , and for a little while at the beginning , it looks as if it will : there are some silly-looking stumbling-and-falling scenes when the Vians first capture the landing party and again when they suspend them in an energy field for observation . The big , ominous test tubes in which the three will presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is revealed seem pretty campy too , particularly since we 've just seen the dead researchers wearing Sci-Fi Expressions of Horrible Agony , which are never anywhere near as scary as simple , featureless death . But as comical as Shatner can be to watch when he 's looking unconvinced by the scenario , he can be equally good when he makes it real , and from the time of the abortive escape when Kirk furiously demands to know what the Vians have done with his men whom they promised to release , his performance is pitch-perfect . Kirk is in agony , and it has nothing to do with having the bends . <p> Gem is the key to any of this mattering , and Kathryn Hays also gives an unforgettable performance , hindered by the fact that she has no dialogue and is called upon to perform exaggerated demonstrations of pain and fright . McCoy 's paternalism toward her , which is at first a little annoying - he flatly refuses to believe that she could be the alien responsible for their abduction - evolves into a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healer that he ca n't even dream of . Kirk does n't seem quite to know what to make of her , as she does n't fit into his model of women who either need to be protected or have powers he needs to learn to understand . The mechanism by which Gem 's people can take on and cure the injuries of others is never explored by these scientifically-trained Starfleet officers . She is profoundly alien to them , someone whose thoughts they can not penetrate and do n't particularly try , though untold numbers of lives besides their own are tied up in her choices . <p> The set-on-the-cheap gives the episode something of the feel of a theatrical piece , since there is little for the camera to focus on besides the actors ' faces ( with a couple of neat angles , like the overhead shot after the characters are first abducted ) . As in " The Menagerie " , the team works its way to the surface , only to have it revealed that they have been misled by illusions ; this brief distraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also forces Jem to look wraithlike and helpless . Her jewel-tone clothes and heavily accented eyes are pretty and exotic to look at , but I wish it were clearer whether she is a child or an adult among her people , and whether the Vians are looking for instincts already present or trying to instill values that she will share telepathically with all the others . <p> The Vians believe Gem to be a tabula rasa who may absorb the Starfleet officers ' values completely , but it 's not very clear how they came to this conclusion , and they seem to leave a lot to chance , given how little time they have left . Apparently the Federation scientists studying the dying star made unsatisfactory examples of " everything that is truest and best " , in their words . There 's no suggestion that the Vians had any telepathic influence over which crewmembers beamed down , and if they did n't , what was Kirk thinking , really , beaming himself and Spock to the surface of a planet whose sun was about to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dead scientists just how much humanity has to offer , for it is certainly what we would deem " human " values as opposed to Vulcan ones that they want Gem to understand : passion , compassion , loyalty , sympathy , maybe even the interconnectedness of all beings . They certainly are n't concerned about whether she will make logical decisions about whom to save . Spock may be able to suppress his emotions well enough to escape from the Vians ' energy field , but no one in this instance is impressed and it changes little . <p> It 's a bit frustrating that it takes a typical speech from Kirk to make the Vians decide that Gem has passed the test and McCoy ( who refuses to let her die for him ) deserves to be saved , but in this case perhaps the writers have justified it , for if the Vians did feel things as deeply as Kirk does , they would n't need the Starfleet officers to teach her what they believe her people must learn . Considering what they do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think it 's because ( since we know the Starfleet officers will survive ) they allow the crewmembers to access and portray what 's really important in their relationships beyond the banter which is largely absent from " The Empath . " It does make a return in the end , as McCoy announces that he finds it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances , it was good old-fashioned human emotion that the Vians valued most . Kirk asks Spock whether he can be prevailed upon to bring this news to the Vulcans , and Spock replies that he " shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due . " Maybe he should have taken the idea more seriously ; he could have spared himself years of trying to find fulfillment through Kohlinahr.

@@58304390 @7304390/ <h> Retro Review : The Q and the Grey <p> Q demands that Janeway have a child with him to stop the civil war in the Continuum caused by Q(uinn)s suicide . <p> Plot Summary : Voyagers crew is thrilled to witnesses a rare supernova up close . Afterwards , Janeway goes to her quarters , only to find that Q has transformed them into a love nest , where he informs her that he wishes her to be the mother of his child . After dismissing him , Janeway warns the bridge crew to be on the lookout for omnipotent interference . While Chakotay expresses concern that Q is pursuing Janeway with puppies and promises of an immediate trip home , the crew discovers several more supernovas , which Q admits are being caused by a conflict within the Continuum triggered by the suicide of the Q whom Janeway previously determined should have the right to be mortal . When Qs longtime lover appears to demand that he give up Janeway , Q confesses that he wants to have a child with Janeway not out of love but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . He takes Janeway to the center of the carnage , depicted as the American Civil War so that Janeway can comprehend the extent of the violence . While the female Q tries to help Chakotay and Torres navigate Voyager into the Continuum so the crew can retrieve their captain and the female Q can reunite with her ex-lover , Janeway tries to work out a negotiation with Qs opponents . She is captured and threatened with execution . The female Q leads Voyagers crew into battle using Continuum weapons . After they rescue Janeway , Q and his ex agree to procreate together to see whether that changes the Continuum and their opponents agree to a ceasefire . With the universe safe from the warring Q , Voyagers crew find themselves back on the ship , where Q arrives to show off his baby to " Auntie Kathy . " <p> Analysis : Among Voyagers episodes , " The Q and the Grey " may be my guiltiest pleasure . It has more sex-and-gender problems even than " Threshold " the other episode in which a powerful male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) evolved into a giant salamander and couldnt be held responsible for his actions , whereas Q , being omnipotent , presumably knows not only how humans court one another in the 24th century , but also what appeals specifically to Janeway , who is briefly swayed by his puppy . Yet " The Q and the Grey " also has that very entertaining characterization of the Q Continuum as the Antebellum South , plus this is why its such a guilty pleasure ! the glorious moment during which Chakotay admits that Q wanting to mate with Janeway really upsets him , at which Q growls that he thinks Chakotay is jealous and Janeway should have told him there was another man . ( Q asks whether the attraction is the forehead tattoo , then gives himself more extensive facial art and declares in classic alpha male fashion , " Mines bigger ! " ) I honestly do n't  know how anyone can read that scene as Chakotay expressing only concern for a superior officer , not deeper feelings he does n't  believe he should verbalize , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reaching out to him when Q interrupts . To put a completely positive spin on " The Q and the Grey " often posited in fan fiction , though not in cast or crew interviews one must believe that Q does n't  really want to have a baby with Janeway at all , since humanoid sexual reproduction is kind of icky ( he says as much to her later ) , but he cant bring himself to admit that what he really wants is her " inferior " human mind , both to help him make the female Q forgive him and to find a way to restore the rest of the Continuum . I 'd accept all of Qs sexism if I thought it was always intended to be parody and if Janeway reacted to it as such . <p> Because its a reasonable test of whether the scriptwriters are being sexist or just writing mediocre dialogue , let 's consider how this story would play out if Kirk or Picard rather than Janeway were Qs intended co-parent . There 's no reason that could n't happen . Q tells Picard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , and since Q reproduction is largely theoretical , especially with lesser species , I 'm not sure why Q does n't  ask Picard instead of Janeway to have a child with him . Theyve shared more emotional intimacy than Q has with Janeway . Apart from Sisko , none of the captains ever expresses any passionate interest in becoming a parent , and despite a prodigious appetite for the act that produces offspring , Kirk does n't  know what to do when he finds out he had a son . Would Q woo Kirk or Picard with the equivalent of bathtub serenades , baby animals , roses and chocolate ? Possibly . Would Q turn up in their bedrooms ? Definitely in fact , he put himself in Picards bed in " Tapestry . " Would Q make the same jokes about committed relationships being equivalent to prison and admit that his devotion would be to his child rather than to his partner ? That answer might be different for Kirk than for Picard , since Kirk , like Q , has a wandering eye , while Picard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterize a male captain as designed for child-rearing on the basis of anatomy , ponder a male captains biological clock , declare that a male captain could make no greater contribution to the universe than producing offspring ? Absolutely not . In an episode full of clever inside jokes about Klingon females and the long friendship between Kate Mulgrew and John de Lancie , why does Q fall back on the phrase " playing hard to get " in its privileged male 20th century usage ? Why would Q expect Janeway to know it and react to it ? To quote Chakotay , this bothers the hell out of me . <p> I 'm glad the writers do n't  belabor the sex-as-commerce question would Janeway sleep with Q if it meant getting back to Earth ? but I also believe that in her situation , stranded in the Delta Quadrant with diminishing resources , Kirk would cheerfully swap sex with Q for a trip home and probably make Q fall in love with him for life in the process . Even centuries in the future , the strongest woman we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a powerful mans lover , baby mama , and nursemaid . Q never thanks Janeway for the intelligence and resourcefulness that make possible the end of the war of the gods , and though Ive always found it forgivable when Q himself behaves in blustering human cliches , which one could argue Q adopts specifically to communicate with Picard and Riker so that when the Borg threat becomes known , theyll take it seriously , now we see the entire Continuum demystified . Multiple Q behave like Americans from a less enlightened century than our own . The guys are running around with guns like standard boring macho men , while the only Q woman we meet played by the same actress as the gloriously independent KEhleyr , Worfs onetime mate adheres to clingy female stereotypes , desperate to recapture her man , eager to have his baby , when she too could be dressed as a soldier fighting the good fight . Either the South is a representation of how Q himself sees the Continuum or its a representation of what he thinks Janeways crew wants to seein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chakotay and Tuvok playfully dressed as Union soldiers . Janeway rises above it , fearless and innovative as she seeks a solution , but then she loses her mind : to prove a point about perseverance , she tells Q he does n't  have to send her crew home because itll mean more if they get there through hard work . <p> In the end , were shown Janeway giving a schoolmarm lecture instead behaving like the relatable , well-rounded human being who reaches out to Chakotay at the moment he seems to be on the verge of the confession we already heard metaphorically once , in " Resolutions " when he promised to stay by her side and do everything he could to make her burden lighter . The thread of that love story made me forgive " The Q and the Grey " for everything , for years , until the writers finally decided theyd never have the guts to see it through and tossed it aside completely in the shows final season . Janeway tells Q that one day she would like to have a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to be a prerequisite . I 'm not sure I agree with her that that 's the strongest foundation of a family love , conscience , and compassion can be found among all sorts of non-nuclear families , whether its grandparents as primary caretakers because birth parents cant take on that role or friends who decide to raise children together but if those are her values , if that 's what she chooses for herself , then I am in complete agreement that she should have a family on her own terms . If Sisko could do it while the Dominion War is underway , Janeway could do it too , and arguably should do it before she turns into the basket case she becomes in later seasons in episodes like " Night . " Where was Q then to ask whether an alternate dimension might tempt her , since she was determined to deny herself all human contact ? It seems fitting that Qs representation of his own peoples war saddles this captain with skirts to trip over . <p> Twenty years ago today , I was at the only science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Starfest in Denver .

At the time she was the one I was most excited to meet , and though I interviewed her a few times afterward , it wound up being the only time I saw her face to face . Many of the friends I made at that convention , however , have remained friends for life . I spoke to several of them yesterday both because it was the anniversary of our meeting and because we had just learned of Princes passing .

It was only as I tried to articulate what Bowie and Prince stood for among people who felt different often in terms of sexuality , but also in terms of creativity and artistry and how we express those things that I could explain it was n't the musicians I was mourning , but the public figures upon whom so many of us projected our own images . Its even more true with Rickman , whose acting I admired but whose appearance as Snape brought together many women of my generation in a franchise wed first encountered while introducing books and movies to our children . I cant imagine what my life would be like right now , who my friends would be , what professional connections in writing I would have made , without these celebrities . So while I express my frustrations with Janeway , I want to mention my gratitude to Mulgrew . I hope Prince and the others knew how much they were appreciated , too .

When he persists in begging her to stay , she shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that she still has feelings for him , though she can not abandon her fight for a free Cardassia . Odo interrupts them to place Lang under arrest ; the Bajoran government has agreed to a prisoner swap with Cardassia , and Sisko has no choice but to obey the terms . An old friend of Garaks , Gul Toran , arrives on the station to take custody of Lang and the others , telling Garak that if he wishes to end his exile , he must kill the terrorists . Quark persuades Odo to let the prisoners escape since they are already slated for execution , but as the group rushes to Langs ship , Garak appears , followed by Toran , who is ready to kill the fugitives himself if Garak wont do it . Garak shoots Toran instead and let 's the others go . Quark asks Lang to let him go with her , but she insists that she would rather know he s safe on the station and promises that she will always love him . <p> Analysis : Its impossible to take " Profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point even more than Mary Crosby , an actress most famous for shooting J.R . on Dallas , playing the great love of Quarks life . There are a lot of problems with its logic , the biggest being that Bajor agrees to a prisoner exchange with Cardassia when supposedly the last Bajoran prisoners were released when Li Nalas was found to be alive in a Cardassian prison camp assuming that the Cardassians were probably lying about that , I still find it very hard to believe that the provisional government would agree to turn over three Cardassians who oppose military rule without even speaking to them , and who told the Bajorans that the Cardassians were on the station anyway ? Were not supposed to be thinking about logic , though ; were supposed to be thinking about the parallels with Casablanca , which sadly do not include a moment in which Quark tells Odo that his help in securing the fugitives escape could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship . Quark is an even more unlikely hero than Rick Blaine , his bar is more seedy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the secretly anti-Nazi American from the legendary film . Thankfully , Lang has no illusions about him , which makes their chemistry believable ; apparently she once thought he had sold food to Bajorans during the Occupation so they could feed their children , but since his act of selfish heroism , helping his love escape so he could save her life , she has realized that it was all about making a profit . She tells him she 's stopped drinking her favorite drink from his bar , she insists that she never wants to hear a Rule of Acquisition again , and she shoots him when he wo n't take no for an answer ! <p> What gives the story teeth is not the revelation that Quark once had an altruistic , politically motivated , Cardassian lover whom hed do anything to get back , but the subplot and its parallel revelation that Garak will do anything to get home . It is he who alerts the Cardassian authorities about the presence of Releken and Hogue who do n't  , in fact , seem to be terrorists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn next to nothing about them , since Sisko and Kira never bother to question them or do any investigation of their activities prior to the attack on their ship . Garak is hopeful that simply exposing the renegades to Cardassian authorities will get him back into the good graces of the Cardassian government , but a sneering Toran insists that he must prove his loyalty by killing them himself . Considering that the episode starts with Garak seeming quite cheerful at one of his regular meals with Bashir , flirting as they discuss the limits of loyalty and Bashirs suspicion that Garak is a spy , its surprising to see him turn vicious so quickly . I 'm quite shocked that Sisko is n't angrier at the discovery that the plain , simple tailor has brought a Cardassian warship to the station , and I 'm truly astonished that Kira does n't  call for Garak to be kicked out of yet another place . I suppose some other Bajoran working in security or Ops could have alerted the provisional government to the Cardassian governments demands , but I would think any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her , and its pretty appalling that she does n't  make a case for the lives of these resistance fighters no matter who the Cardassians have offered up in trade . <p> Though its a pleasure to hear Quark spout self-interested optimism instead of Rick Blaines weary cynicism , the love scenes are rather too talky and go on too long . Maybe were supposed to be impressed that Quark can be articulate and passionate as well as lustful and greedy , but all the talk about sacrifice and happiness starts to drag down the action , considering that at the time no one is stealing letters of transit or even an illegal cloaking device something else that I 'd think would be a much bigger deal to both Sisko and Kira , considering that its presence on the station could bring in a Romulan fleet . I approve of Odo letting the fugitives escape because his sense of justice means he cant allow them to be executed without a trial as would surely happen on Cardassia , but its odd that he does n't  express outrage to either Sisko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither immediately calls him in after the escape to demand to know how it happened . In good film noir of the Humphrey Bogart era , loose ends are tied up much more neatly . The Cardassian rebel students are annoyingly one-dimensional and we never do learn what theyve done at such young ages to make them such a threat , but I 'd be willing to overlook that for a stronger sense of how the command crew would respond to such a crisis since they , not Quark , are usually the ones who behave heroically rather than pragmatically . The lovely moment in which Quark first encounters Lang and in typical overstatement tells her that she 's as beautiful as ever , to which she retorts that he s as big a liar as ever , seems more real and grounded than the love scenes , and I really adore Quarks goading of Odo to free Lang , taunting that Odo has all the emotions of a stone . It seems as if these small moments will have to serve as the emotional highlights of this romantic dramaat least , until Garak steals the show at the end .

How could the same makeup people who gave us the elegant Cardassians do such a thing to the Romulans ? The brow ridges make them look expressionless . Ditch them and create something better . <p> 9 . DO Hire experienced , classically trained character actors for most of the regulars and not just for the ridgeheads .

Just because a guy is young and handsome does n't mean he 's sexy to women . Many male actors are gay , and that 's fine , but they have trouble projecting masculinity on-screen . <p> 10 . DO Make your sets and lighting conform to the atmosphere you wish to create . DS9 was supposed to be gritty and edgy but we had soft warm colors on everyone . As for colors , if you a want dark and mean atmosphere use cold colors of lights -dirty white and blue , not warm like yellow , green and red as ds9 did which was anti-climatic . X Files always has grayish light which makes things spooky and foreboding . <p> 11 . DO N'T ever ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one believed Kira in a catsuit , which was so different from other Bajoran uniforms . Seven of Nine is now known as " Borg Barbie " for her ridiculous costume .

I cheered when they finally put her in a proper uniform . She looked much better <p> 12 . DO remember that on a woman over thirty , less is more : makeup I mean . I swear sometimes poor Troi looked like it had been put on with a trowel . I do n't know how many rows of false eyelashes they put on her but I was suprised she could keep her eyes open . Ditch the glossy lipcolors and the elaborate wigs . Nana Visitor 's eyelashes grew to such proportions they were all I could see at the end . The poor woman looked like a clownish freak . Her pale skin , bright red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her either . It clashed with the orange uniform and made her look like a teenager experimenting with different " looks " Women in prominent roles like this will have little time to fuss over hair and makeup anyway . <p> 13 . DO N'T rely on the holodeck . Ditch it like the writer 's crutch it is . If exploration is n't exciting enough why are we doing another series ? <p> 14 . DO stop playing favorites with the actors . Come on ! You know what I mean . We can calculate screen-time too . Be professional and deal with the characters and the plot , not your personal favorites. 15 . DO N'T put us into another war . Vow , like the Japanese , to renounce war as a plot device . <p> 16 . DO find whoever was responsible for the RED CONTACT LENSES . I want him/her . I want him bad . I want him/her flogged with a wet typewriter ribbon . This was the most execrable , cartoonish , childish , spiteful thing I have ever seen on Star Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spock 's Brain . " <p> 17 . DO N'T listen to fanmail . Most fan campaigns along the lines of " We the undersigned want X to happen " , along with 10,000 signatures , are just five fans and a Xerox machine . Do n't trust internet polls they are cheat fests . Do n't trust much of anything on the internet.

Meanwhile , the Enterprise is fired upon by an asteroid that upon investigation proves to be moving through the galaxy on an independent course ... which will cause it to collide with an inhabited world if it is not diverted . Kirk , Spock and McCoy beam to the asteroid 's hollow center and discover a colony of humanoids , descendants of the Fabrini who left their homeworld when their sun went nova . These people call their world Yonada and are governed by the priestess Natira , who serves and takes command from a godlike computer . She falls in love with the ailing McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer and study the asteroid . When they are forced to return to the Enterprise , McCoy decides to remain and marry Natira . As part of the wedding ceremony , McCoy is shown the secrets of Yonada , including the book that contains information about how to control the artificial asteroid . The computer punishes him for sharing this information with the Enterprise , but Kirk and Spock have already beamed back to Yonada , where they use his knowledge to find the control room and reprogram the propulsion systems . They also find the Fabrini medical database , which contains a cure for McCoy 's condition . But Natira chooses not to witness the secrets of her ancestors , and she and McCoy agree to part . <p> Analysis : There 's nothing terribly wrong with " For the World Is Hollow , and I Have Touched the Sky " except that it 's extremely clumsily done , like the people involved just could n't be bothered to put in that extra effort which might have made this a thoughtful or moving episode . It has its moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon learning that one of his best friends is dying , Spock 's quiet concern for McCoy which betrays the fact that he knows too - while what should be dramatic scenes , like McCoy choosing companionship over his career and Natira discovering that her god may have lied to her , just are n't big enough . The intriguing sets of Yonada , like the Oracle Room , are undercut by costumes that make little sense for the repressed society controlled by a computer . Why are the men wearing shiny plaid suits and carrying swords when wrongdoers can be punished for their crimes by a computer ? Why are the women wearing provocative gowns when only the priestess is allowed to choose her own mate ? <p> The episode feels both too short and too long ... too long in that it drags , particularly the tedious scenes where Kirk and Spock go hunting for facts and get zapped by the Oracle , yet too short in that we do n't get the same kind of exploration of this very restrictive society that we did in " Return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a seemingly much larger population , there was an organized resistance . The only resistance we see on Yonada comes from the source of the episode 's title , in which an old man confesses that once he climbed the mountains and discovered that the world is hollow , for he had touched the sky ... an admission that results in his immediate death by the Oracle which apparently monitors every word , if not every thought , of the citizens . I assume he survived so long with this knowledge because he never spoke it aloud , but what inspires him to tell the strangers after keeping silent among his priestess and people ? <p> And along similar lines , Natira is at first adamant in her insistence that the Oracle can do no wrong , then abruptly willing to court death to question the nature of her world , but we do n't see McCoy slowly breaking down her defenses , encouraging her to question ; he accepts the Instrument of Obedience as the price for sharing his life with her and very nearly dies when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet he never makes what I 'd expect to be subtle efforts to get Natira to think and question for herself . Other than her beauty and the fact that she is drawn immediately to him - one of the rare instances in which a girl shows no interest at all in Kirk or Spock - we do n't really see what he sees in her that would make him choose love in her very restricted society over the companionship of his friends of many years . Really , they barely know each other , and she certainly does n't know his value system if she does n't realize that he 's not going to stop trying to save her society whether interference is forbidden or not . <p> There 's so much it would have been interesting to know about how Yonada functions - is the sun in their sky holographic , how is the air recycled and the climate controlled - are we looking at a perfect ecosphere , where careful control of reproduction allows the plants to replenish oxygen for the animals and decaying organic matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in place , hidden from the childlike Fabrini descendants , that allows them to continue oblivious to the delicate machinery keeping them all alive ? How many people must be destroyed each year because they ask too many questions or come too close to expressing the truth ... or , if they do not question , how will they be ready to form a self-governing society when they reach the planet that is the asteroid 's original destination ? Starfleet appears to wish to stay uninvolved . <p> In fact , there is some implication that Starfleet may be thinking about blowing up Yonada to save the planet with which it may collide , as Kirk and Spock are ordered to leave quickly and move on to their next mission while Kirk is still mourning the loss of his chief medical officer and friend . The breakthrough that allows the Enterprise officers to save both Yonada and McCoy happens quickly , with little sense of peril , and once McCoy is cured , he gives little thought to the woman with whom he had intended to spend what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to look at the machinery that replaced her Oracle ? Or does having his death sentence rescinded simply remind him of how much bigger his universe can be ? <p> So many questions left unanswered , so many more never asked . Even Spock seems content to communicate with McCoy on an empathic level rather than speaking logic to him - the fact that they have a year to study and possibly cure his condition , the likelihood that he is hiding rather than choosing happiness by staying with Natira . There are intriguing possibilities in " For the World ... " but ultimately the episode is hollow , and there 's no sky to touch .

They felt that the two-parter , so near the series ' end , was an attempt to throw in original series references that were n't grounded in anything from Enterprise , and " when you play a role for 98 television hours , and then you 're asked to play that role totally differently , nobody knows how you 're supposed to do it . " During rehearsals he recalled the director telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood exactly what that meant . When he saw it , " I thought it looked cool ... but the rest , I did n't understand it . " <p> Asked by a fan about the lack of long-term relationships on any of the Star Trek shows , Trinneer said , " In my situation specifically , my character is dealing with a character who did n't show her emotions at all . I did have a conversation with the writers about our relationship ... after a certain point I felt that they had taken Trip 's spine away from him and he was just following her around : ' You want to get married ? Okay . Take your time . ' " Trinneer felt it was something of a " dealbreaker " to be with someone like T'Pol who refused to show emotions and only wanted to have sex once every seven years . He also noted that a military situation is " not really one that 's conducive to ' Captain , I 'm in love ... I just wanted to share that with you ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a fan later joked that it was brave of Trinneer to acknowledge Tucker 's forbidden love for Archer , he said straightfaced , " I think that subtext played throughout the series . I do n't know if you noticed it . I fixed his chair , I was jealous of the dog ... " And , grinning , " Go back and watch some of these episodes and it 's really subversive in that regard . " <p> As for the romantic scenes with T'Pol , Trinneer found those nearly as difficult as the alternate universe scenario . " You do these scenes with people that you develop friendships with on the show , and it 's generally uncomfortable to go in there and do a sex scene , " he noted . " That sounds stupid , but it 's true . " Having never had romantic feelings for Jolene Blalock , nor she for him , and having 30 people making faces behind the camera , " To go in there and try to get the reality ... the fact that people can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare , he added , was easier than technobabble : " Shakespeare 's not hard .

" <p> Though the producers refused to admit that the Xindi arc was intended to be an allegory for the aftermath of the events of 9/11 , Trinneer said that for him that understanding influenced the entire third season and the way he portrayed Tucker 's grief and anger over the death of his sister . Asked what he used for motivation for crying onscreen - images of dead puppies or tragic childhood incidents - he joked , " I was big baby on the show , was n't I ? " but added that he really needed little imagination to be able to work up emotion for the events . When he had to react to the news of Tucker 's sister 's death , he said he just imagined having to be without his own sister , and when his character and T'Pol had a baby , he had only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actors can force tears by using " stuff like Noxema " under the eyes and putting their heads down .

" When that last comment met with applause , he added , " Let 's not get started . I might agree with it , but others might not ! " The actor holds an MFA degree in acting and directing and had plans to tail Voyager actor and Enterprise director Robert Duncan McNeill ( Paris ) when he directed an upcoming episode of The O.C. to study the craft .

' " He said that his minor celebrity never really affects them in Los Angeles because there are so many actors , though perhaps once a week someone will politely tell him his work is appreciated , which he enjoys . " I 'm only a celebrity to you guys , god bless you all , " grinned Trinneer . " To the rest of the world , they do n't really know who I am .

" Fundamentally there 's a huge difference between the two of them , " said McNeill . " Nick Locarno was somebody who appeared to be a really good guy to the Starfleet teachers , faculty and staff , but deep down was a rotten guy . I think Tom Paris was the complete opposite of that . He appeared to be a little rotten on the outside , but was really a good guy underneath it all . Initially , Voyagers creators might have conceived the character to be very much like Nick Locarno , but it became clear to me quite early on that he had to be very different . " <p> " Nick Locarno was someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief purpose , " explained McNeill . " But for Tom Paris to last , as well as be relevant , he had to be a real hero and a character who , underneath all his warts , faults and weaknesses , was someone that viewers would want to come back to every week . That 's why I felt it was necessary to bring a sense of humor to Paris . To me , Star Trek was its most successful whenever it had a bit of irony and tongue-in-cheek quality along with a sense of fun and adventure . So I tried to bring the spirit of that into everything I did , even if it was n't scripted . <p> For Tom Paris , being stranded on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant meant a second chance , but he had to prove himself to his captain and fellow shipmates . <p> " What was really important for our show was that this mismatched group of people came together with their strengths and became a team , " said McNeill . " That was a challenge , though , with Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone wolf . So I looked for opportunities to showcase his value as a team player . <p> " That began in the pilot with Harry Kim Garrett Wang , where I wanted to show Tom as being sort of the wiser , older brother to this character . Even if it was lightly scripted , I tried my best to emphasize that while Tom might look like he does n't  care about anybody else , he actually does care about Harry , who 's a little less experienced and needs a bit of help . The more I did that , the more , I think , our writers started writing to it . <p> " Something else I feel was unique about Tom was the fact that he was kind of a down-to-earth straight talker . With all the technobabble , sci-fi talk and complicated stories and situations , I tried to be the one who had a sense of plain speak and be a little folksy with my character . "

He explained how he felt that Richard Woolsey has moved beyond just being a heavy and a foil to Richard Dean Anderson . " I think what ended up helping me is when I did the first guest star the writers and producers , specifically Joe Mallozzi and Paul Mullie , just decided they kind of liked me and kind of wanted me to hang around , " he explained .

" Once we got into the third or fourth episode writers who were pitching the show got a sense of The Doctor 's possibilities , and so they got a lot of stories pitched for me , " explained Picardo . " But also I went frequently to the writer 's office . Brannon Braga does a great impersonation of me hiding in the bushes outside the writer 's office so when he came out for a smoke I would jump him and say ' You know , Brannon , I was thinking , dot dot dot ' . In retrospect , the best suggestion I made was how The Doctor related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kes left the show because her character was The Doctor 's confidant and he revealed himself in a way to her that he did n't with anyone else . I was concerned that The Doctor would no longer have his sounding board . When I mentioned this to Brannon he asked that I come up with a way I could related to the new character , so I went off and thought about it and decided to turn the dynamic around . Because Kes had basically tutored The Doctor in his developing humanity , I thought would n't be wonderful if The Doctor thought he was more suited than a human to teach Seven how to reclaim her humanity . So I proposed the whole thing of the role playing and the social appropriateness lessons . I did n't know they would carry that arc for four years . " <p> When asked where he thought the EMH would be seven years after Voyager had returned from the Delta Quadrant , Picardo said , " I think of him lecturing at Starfleet Academy and traveling all over the galaxy for guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has written several treatises on Holopology , which of course is the study of hologram culture and art . I think he has been a guest soloist with the San Francisco Symphony singing some of his favorite arias .

Remember The Doctor does n't  age , so I figure after ten or twelve years The Doctor is starting to look good . "

After the crew draws lots to determine who should get to enjoy shore leave on the pleasure planet , Archer , Sato , Mayweather , Tucker and Reed head down in a shuttlepod . The latter two declare their intention to ' broaden ' their cultural horizons ; meanwhile Mayweather wants to go rock climbing , Sato wants to learn the local language and Archer wants to relax with his dog . Meanwhile , back on the ship , Phlox enters a state of hibernation , leaving Cutler in charge of sickbay . <p> In a restaurant , Sato meets a man from a planet with an unpronounceable name . She spends nearly a day trying to learn his language while he easily masters hers . Tucker and Reed head to a club that even the Vulcan database acknowledges to be a hot spot ; after spending some time checking out exotic aliens , they meet two women whom they deem worth pursuing and invite them for drinks . In a secluded villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then meets the woman herself when she comes to retrieve her pet . She introduces herself as Keyla and agrees to have dinner with him the next evening . <p> To her surprise , Sato finds herself falling for the attractive Ravis and spends the night with him . Tucker and Reed are n't so lucky ; the women they picked up at the club turn out to be alien thugs who transform into bald men and steal the Enterprise crewmembers ' clothes . Mayweather does n't have much fun either , for he falls while climbing and has an allergic reaction to a pain suppressant given to him at a Risan hospital . When he arrives on Enterprise , Cutler fears he could go into shock and reluctantly brings Phlox out of hibernation . The doctor has trouble focusing , but he manages to treat Mayweather before falling back asleep . <p> Archer enjoys the company of Keyla , though she is in mourning for family members who died in a Suliban attack . But when she becomes too aggressive in her questioning of him , he becomes suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis . When Archer confronts Keyla with his discovery that she is Tandaran , she knocks him out to protect her privacy , insisting that though he has been kind , he does not understand her . Asked on the trip back whether he got a good night 's sleep , Archer admits that he went out like a light . <p> Analysis : Archer 's Captain 's holiday is n't all it 's cracked up to be , but then , when are they ever ? I 'm racking my brain trying to think of a Risa episode I did n't think was stupid -- and failing -- so while I 'll admit I did n't love ' Two Days And Two Nights , ' it was neither as tasteless nor as feebly plotted as it could have been , despite its banality . Ironically , this week 's outing was directed by Michael Dorn , who had the misfortune to star as Worf in Deep Space Nine 's dreadful ' Let He Who is Without Sin ... ' In that episode , environmental terrorists were trying to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's era , swimming-pool-blue water and golf-course-green vegetation thrive in all their phony-looking glory . In the earlier era on Risa , people apparently do n't walk around carrying statues as an indication that they 're in the mood for love , either , which is just as well ; when Tucker promised to bring T'Pol back a souvenir , I thought for sure that he 'd be giving her one . <p> That absence , however , is the only unpredictable element of the hour . When Hoshi scoffs at the men for plotting to get laid , it 's fairly easy to deduce that she 'll meet a handsome stranger ; when Trip and Malcolm reject women whose eyes appear too ' alien ' for their tastes and zero in on two human-looking hotties , it 's unquestionable that they 'll turn out to be thugs and probably male as well . Not that I 'm complaining about the latter ; after having to listen to the boyz objectify women 's bodies for several minutes , the kinky overtones of their capture , stripping and bondage put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Shuttlepod One , ' the producers seem to be doing everything in their power to give Tucker/Reed slash fans plenty of food for thought . In all seriousness , the humor works better here than in ' Shuttlepod One ' partly because their suffering and humiliation are actually more believable locked in the wine cellar in their underwear . <p> It 's nice by contrast that Sato falls head-first , impressed with her new friend 's language skills and shared interests , rather than from staring at the bumps on his forehead or elsewhere . Archer , too , gets involved warily with a woman whose dog seems an oh-too-convenient excuse for a meeting . There 's no question that she 'll turn out to have a nefarious agenda ; for me the only question was whether she would turn out to be someone who hated Suliban or someone who was Suliban . The thread ends ambiguously with the discovery that Keyla is Tandaran , but just as all Suliban are n't evil Cabal members , all Tandarans surely are n't genocidal totalitarians like Grat , and this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it . Then again , she shows no compunction about knocking him out and fleeing so she does n't have to explain herself . Her spots appear to resemble those of the Trill , though we do n't really get a good look at them despite her bathing suit , and since we know she 's been genetically altered , they probably do n't mean anything . I presume that she 'll return at some point , though whether Archer 's friendliness to her will count as a strike in his favor or a detriment , it 's hard to guess . <p> As for Mayweather 's injury ... the moment we see Phlox go into hibernation , it 's a sure bet that someone will be critically wounded . Since Enterprise seems to be following Deep Space Nine 's pattern of not allowing a black male character to express too much interest in the sort of animal sexuality with which Tucker and Reed seem preoccupied , it 's a pretty good bet that Mayweather will be the guy rushed back to the ship ( though really it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Instead of a vacation , he gets a broken leg , a trip to an alien hospital and a brush with anaphylactic shock ; bet he wishes some of the non-regular characters had drawn lots for shore leave instead of the bridge crew . <p> I guess the doctor 's bumbling incompetence while half-asleep is supposed to be humorous . But the slapstick falls dreadfully short , and does n't really tell us anything about his species ' biology ; finding out how and why they usually hibernate would be much more enlightening . And what happened to Phlox 's nascent romance with Cutler ? Not only does n't it come through in the text or subtext , but she looks upon his physical necessity with apparent distaste . Worse , we do n't get any indication that she 's becoming a competent medic . But even that is predictable ; this is Star Trek after all , where love affairs frequently go into hibernation for years on end . <p> Structurally , this is a very sound episode . Four separate plot lines run parallel without ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the short shrift . The planetary exterior shots seem both sparse and phony , but the interior of the restaurants and Archer 's bungalow look spacious and lovely , a nice change as always from shipboard episodes . I appreciate the nods to past storylines and the character continuity . <p> A few morals : always take your scanner with you on away missions , remember that dogs make better babe-magnets than pretending to be the captain , and keep in mind that if you spend all your time talking about yourself and your date does n't get bored and leave , she 's probably after something besides your body . The good news is that just about every humanoid race seems to know what kisses are , no matter what words they use . 
@@58304492 @7304492/ <h> Patterns of Force <p> Plot Summary : On the way to the planet Ekos to investigate the disappearance of Starfleet Academy professor John Gill , the Enterprise comes under attack by a weapon far more advanced than the crew had anticipated . Upon beaming down , Kirk and Spock discover that the primitive Ekosians have industrialized and built a society that very closely mimics Nazi Germany , right down to the uniforms and secret police , and are planning to destroy the neighboring planet Zeon , starting with any Zeons who live on Ekos . The mastermind behind this plan is Fuhrer John Gill . Though Kirk and Spock try to disguise themselves as Nazis , they are taken prisoner and escape with a member of the underground , who explains that the Nazi movement 's genesis coincided with Gill 's rise to power . He and his associates are shocked to learn that Gill is an alien but claim that Deputy Fuhrer Melakon is really ruling the planet while Gill lives in isolation .

Gill denounces the Deputy Fuhrer , only to be shot by Melakon , who is killed in turn by the resistance . The Ekosians promise peace with Zeon and rebuilding . <p> Analysis : " Patterns of Force " is an episode I really want to like , to appreciate the warnings about fascism and how easily hatred is cultivated , but like " A Private Little War , " it 's just too cynical and has too many points of stupidity to be a real success . A man whom we 're told is one of the greatest historians of his era tries to build a society modeled upon Nazi Germany - not just based on a misperception of the efficiency of the industrial programs , which would have exhausted available natural resources had they continued unchecked , but including all the horrors from the rampant militarism of a police state to the ideology of racial purity . Gill even reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Noninterference Directive is the only way , " he wheezes on his deathbed , and even the Zeons feel sorry for him , but particularly rewatching the show this time around , this just makes me angry . <p> Gill 's mistake was n't violating the Prime Directive , and it was n't ( as Kirk , Spock and McCoy babble at the end ) overlooking the fact that any leader wo n't be able to resist the urge to play God . ( That 's the same sort of cynicism about human nature at work in " A Private Little War , " which is in direct contradiction of the hokey but wonderful human nature Kirk speechifies about in " Return To Tomorrow " and even " Mirror , Mirror " -- " In every revolution there is one man with a vision !

How did he never read George Santayana , who wrote that those who fail to heed the lessons of history are doomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what history teaches us is that we never learn from history ? <p> Kirk and Spock live in an era when humans , a surprising amount of the time , demonstrate that they have learned from history . They do stupid meddlesome things on other planets sometimes , particularly when those planets appear to be reproducing patterns like those seen on Earth , but they have laws in place to try to stop them from doing that too much and problems usually arise when the intention is usually to spread democracy and freedom among people who have n't yet grasped the concept . The idea behind the Prime Directive is n't that one idiotic Starfleet professor might engineer a planetary takeover , but that civilizations have to work through their own wars and prejudices and baggage before they are ready to grasp the freedom of moving among the stars . In a later generation , Picard is actually ready to let an entire planet 's population die rather than risk contaminating them so that they can be moved ! <p> Okay , I found that Next Gen episode painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I find Gill even more painfully stupid , and Kirk spends the entire episode apologizing for him . Oh , John Gill would never have knowingly recreated Nazi Germany , he tells Spock . Then , well , okay , maybe John Gill did it , but his intentions must have been good . Oh , look , John Gill was drugged and his evil second-in-command took over ... it was n't his fault . Oh , and John Gill said he was sorry before he died , let 's leave these people to sort out the gigantic mess Starfleet has created among them and go back to the ship and make jokes about civil wars . It 's in terrible taste , and " Patterns of Force " was originally aired 40 years ago , when many Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans and European civilians victimized by the Nazis were watching . What were they thinking , ending with a pat " Oh , that was a silly mistake ! " and some teasing ? <p> What works in this episode is all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style sneaking around in a fascist country , with Kirk and Spock first pretending to be Nazis , then helping a member of the resistance escape , then having to fight off resistance members disguised as Nazis to be sure of their loyalty . Any episode in which Kirk and Spock are shirtless in a prison cell makes up for a whole host of gratuitous shots of Uhura 's legs , Chapel 's cleavage , etc. , and the fact that they 're climbing all over each other to escape just increases the naughty titillation value . Of course , in order to enjoy these things , one has to block out the fact that people are dying all over the episode - Daras ' father , Isak 's fiancTe ( who was abused while she lay dying ) - that the real Nazi atrocities feel rather trivialized by this storyline , which almost gives me a new appreciation for Enterprise 's much-loathed " Storm Front . " <p> " Patterns of Force " is n't quite campy enough to get away with trivializing Nazis as Mel Brooks has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious statement about the evils of fascism and have its comic tag too . There 's the oddness of Ekosian leader Eneg , whose name is a reversal of that of World War II veteran and series creator Gene Roddenberry , renouncing his Nazi ways and declaring that it 's time to live the way the Fuhrer intended , while many of the Zeons have Jewish-sounding names ( Isak , Abrom , Davod ) and maybe it all hits a little too close to home ... Voyager 's " Remember , " which is also a Holocaust allegory , is much more effective . Maybe when it aired it was enough to show two Jewish actors , Shatner and Nimoy , wearing Gestapo uniforms as they struggled to depict Star Trek idealism in this story about a Federation mercy mission gone horribly awry .

@@58304498 @7304498/ <h> Beating around the Beltran <p> By Caillan DavenportPosted at December 29 , 2000 - 11:41 PM GMT <p> It 's depressing when the infamy of Voyager 's backstage activities overshadows the show itself . With the latest splurge of Robert Beltran comments , the battle lines are clearer than ever . Most recently , Kate Mulgrew seemingly shot back her own response to Beltran 's complaints , lambasting " lazy actors . " The media hoopla that surrounds Voyager , however , seems to give all these comments a life of their own . <p> A report on November 30th , entitled " Mulgrew Criticises Lazy Actors , " and billed by TrekToday editor Amy Hightower as " a thinly veiled attack on Robert Beltran , " contains a transcript of an interview aired on the UPN9 station in America . At the end , the transcript states : <p> Mulgrew : That 's a lazy actor 's response . ' They did n't let me act ' . Really ? Go get a job in a cereal commercial . I just do n't have any time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Sit in this seat and say nothing . Do it ! Be it ! ( turns towards second officer 's chair ) Lift it up ! We 're all trained here and we 're , you know , compensated *very* nicely . Fandom.com 's Star Trek Central also reported the interview , again emphasising Mulgrew 's " lazy actors " comments : <p> Kate Mulgrew said in the interview " I do n't  buy that for one minute . That 's a lazy actors response . They did n't  let me act . Really ? Go get a job in a cereal commercial . I just do n't  have any time for it . Of course , you can find every opportunity , " she says turning to look towards Chakotays chair . " Sit in the seat and say nothing . Do it ! Be it ! Lift it up ! Were all trained here and we , you know , were compensated very nicely . " <p> When I actually downloaded the interview , however , I think it is open to a different interpretation . Mulgrew is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the Captain 's chair . Thus , in order to turn towards the first officer 's chair , she would have had to turn around completely , rather than simply turn her head , which is all that took place . Mulgrew often uses extravagant gestures , so it seems only natural that she would do so in this instance . <p> The editors of TrekToday and Star Trek Central made very different comments on their reports , however . Amy Hightower stated that " I 'd say from that it 's pretty obvious I misinterpreted what I saw . " She then went on to say that it was in fact another Webmaster who mentioned Beltran 's actions to her , who " noted to me that Mulgrew was turning towards Chakotay 's chair while talking about ' lifting it up ' and suggested that I include it in the transcript . As you can see , I did , trusting in his judgement and never actually went back to check the clip , so in that the fault is mine . " Amy added that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , although she did n't offer any opinion on the matter . <p> Antony at Star Trek Central , however , said " I stand by what I wrote , " adding that " when STC was more of an opinion/editorial site I think opinion was fair , but as we move to just news reporting I 'm striving to be more neutral . I think I 'm achieving that all the more now , but it 's something that has to be done , and I may not always achieve . But also everyone inherently adds opinion to things . " <p> Elaborating on this , Antony explained his reasoning . " With this particular item , as I said , I stand by what I wrote . No , she 's not in her captain 's chair . But not only is it plainly obvious who she 's talking about , but she does sweep around that way when talking about that point . I felt her movement was enough to merit a mention . She also says about " sitting in the seat " which again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she says " sitting in the seat " I think she is looking at the commander 's chair . I 've tried to do a screen grab , I 'm unable to , but at time index 1.56 she does clearly look that way . The interviewer is in front of her , so who would she be speaking to in that direction ? " Antony 's comments show that there are obviously two , equally valid , interpretations of Mulgrew 's interview , and also , that he continually strives to report as impartially as possible . <p> Now , I 'm not condoning Kate Mulgrew 's comments here , even though she did n't expressly mention Beltran by name . I 'd rather the Voyager cast and crew did n't give any more interviews if they can be interpreted as a mudslinging match . It damages the show , and the franchise 's integrity . However , as Antony mentioned , it 's inevitable that opinions sneak in , even when we try to write objectively . The latest outburst of Beltran criticisms began with a UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reported at Trek Today on July 7th . The report , written by Trek Today editor Christian Hohne Sparborth , consists of what he terms " highlights , " which are all negative remarks made by Beltran about Voyager . However , upon close examination of the actual report , Beltran actually had some positive things to say about Voyager , none of which made it into the Trek Today report . Here 's some positive " highlights " which I picked up on : <p> Q : Any memorable moments on the set ? <p> RB : Well , yeah , six years worth ! There are a lot that stand out , because we make it a point to make our ten , twelve , fifteen hours on the set as fun as possible . Otherwise we would all have quit a long time ago . But it 's kind of hard to pinpoint . And there are kids here too . That 's very limiting as far as telling some of our stories ! But take it from me we have a lot of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never thought that I 'd be on a Star Trek series , yet here I am . And I have no regrets . <p> Q : Do you think Star Trek is a very moral thing , with a very commendable ethic running through it ? <p> RB : Yeah , in some ways it is . If you 're an evolutionist , yes , it 's your heaven , but if you 're not you could quibble quite a lot with the show . It 's very positive in a humanist sense . <p> Q : So what do you think of " The Fight " ? <p> RB : I did n't think it was that bad ! I appreciated the fact that I got to do something different . <p> And perhaps most tellingly , Beltran remarked on his fellow cast members , and although to some his impersonations of Robert Picardo and others may come off as slightly mean , he said that " You may get the impression I 'm being catty , but we do this all the time to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in front of them . " A comment such as this goes a long way towards highlighting the camaraderie on the Voyager set . ( The full report can be found here . ) <p> It would be incredibly naive of me to suggest that Beltran 's comments on his UK tour were wholly positive about Voyager , because they were n't . However , he did make some positive remarks about Voyager , and it 's good to hear the other side of the story . Rowan Green , creator of " The Borg Grail " website , also attended one of Robert Beltran 's UK appearances , made the following comment in her report : <p> " Well , he is certainly very cynical about the whole thing . However , I found myself very much enjoying his dry sense of humour , and he had nice things to say as well . In the end I found that I like and respect him . <p> .... <p> As I 've already said he can be scathing ( though with his Beltran 's dry sense of humour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting comments should be taken ) . " <p> The comments take on an interesting dynamic when we hear from someone who was actually present at the time . Rowan Green 's report more fully reflects Beltran 's humour than any sensationalist soundbites ever could . <p> On the other hand , Beltran obviously is n't a science-fiction fan , full stop . His remarks on Star Trek extend far beyond Voyager , although some may like to think that he is only criticising the latter . Comments like " my analysis of Star Trek is that is gives the appearance of being very complex , and it 's all done with smoke and mirrors " do n't really do much to endear himself to the Trek community . Often , it 's difficult to tell whether he is genuine or just pulling your leg , but I 'd say in this case that he does n't really appreciate the genuine inspirational quality of Star Trek . Beltran himself admits that he does n't read the full scripts anymore . Quite frankly , it smacks of not really caring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers wo n't write good material for Chakotay because Beltran does n't put much effort in , and Beltran wo n't pull his weight unless he gets better writing . If we look back on previous seasons , however , it is only in season six that Chakotay 's role began to diminish slightly . In season five there was " Extreme Risk , " " In the Flesh , " " Timeless , " " The Fight , " and " Juggernaut " that all featured a lot of material for Chakotay 's character , particularly in his relationship with B'Elanna and Janeway ; many of the " Timeless " scenes were particularly moving in this regard . <p> " Equinox , Part II , " the season six premiere , also featured some meaty scenes for Beltran , as did " Barge of the Dead , " " One Small Step , " " Memorial " and " Tsunkatse " although they were not specifically " Chakotay episodes . " In all these instances , the material was there , so sometimes Beltran 's comments do seem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for working within an ensemble cast , and not giving up . Mulgrew , in the above mentioned interview , talked about how " lazy actors " should " lift it up , " which Beltran does n't always do . Now , perhaps Mulgrew should n't have been so scathing in her comments , but Beltran was equally frank in his comments about the series . Maybe they should all grow up . <p> Ken Biller has said he ca n't do anything about Chakotay 's character , which is plainly untrue . As Executive Producer , he could lobby for better writing and more fulfilling characterisation , but they need to work together with Beltran . Hopefully , with some good sense and collaborative thinking , they could push Chakotay 's character further . It 's never too late . But Beltran needs to contribute - " lift it up " seems like good advice to me . <p> The media places too much of an emphasis on sensationalism - why else would most websites concentrate on Mulgrew 's " lazy actors " comment , as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , learning about the characters and what makes them tick just is n't enough any more . Now we have to hear about every on-set quibble , every comment , every remark . Harking back to what I said in the last column - it 's all about perception . Several cast members have remarked on the fact that their characters might die or become " tragic figures " , and this has often been interpreted that the cast members are unhappy with their roles . Could n't this be interpreted that they want their character to go out with a bang ? Mulgrew in particular , even with the infamous " go out in a coffin " comment , has only wanted what was best for her character , because she understands Janeway . I ca n't think of a more fitting end for our valiant captain than to see her go down with the ship . It works . It makes sense to anyone who watches the show . <p> Beltran does get material , good material . To say that Beltran has nothing to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like those people who say that Voyager has " no continuity . " Beltran gets good material and Voyager does have continuity , it just takes people with some modicum of intelligence to actually spot subtlety . Sometime in the near future , I 'd like to see the truth back in business . <p> Voyager is almost at the finishing gate , but if Beltran 's not careful , he 's going to be left behind .

When the Borg attack , she beams up most of the away teams and takes the ship to hide in the atmosphere of the planets sun , using an experimental shielding technique .

Hugh resents the Enterprise crew for this and refuses to help Riker , though he agrees to show him where Picard is being held once he learns LaForge is among the captives . Meanwhile , Data keeps Picard and Troi locked up and begins to experiment on LaForge , whose attempts to remind Data of their shared friendship are met with apathy . LaForge suspects that Lore is triggering Datas negative emotions using a transmitter and guesses that an energy pulse might reset Datas ethical programming . Picard and Troi steal a transmitter and emit the pulse with it , causing Data to express ethical concerns to his brother . Lore announces that Data must prove his loyalty by killing Picard , which Data refuses to do , for which Lore sentences Data to death . But before he can execute Data , Hugh arrives with weapons , and in the ensuing fight , Riker and Worf free Picard and Troi . Data chases Lore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must deactivate and disassemble Lore . Picard persuades Hugh that he can be the new leader of the Borg . Back aboard the Enterprise , Data tells LaForge that he will never use the emotion chip designed for himself and stolen by Lore , now that he knows emotions can make him hurt his friends . <p> Analysis : I 'll admit up front that " Descent " is not one of my favorite Next Generation two-parters . Its the darkest storyline for a major character all series , and its exceptionally violent , even if most of the horror takes place offscreen . The only real levity comes at the very start , when Data plays holographic poker with Newton , Einstein , and Stephen Hawking ( the latter played by himself ) with Newtons stuffy irritation at the game contrasting with Einsteins humor and Hawkings pride at winning before a Red Alert cuts off the game . A red-shirted ensign all right , a gold-shirted ensign becomes the first to die in an episode with a very high body count , and then Data commits a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacker who knows his name . Rikers biggest concern upon returning to the ship is n't the dead crewmember or Datas behavior , though : its the change in the Borg , since , as Troi says , the only Borg with a name was Hugh at they gave it to him . Specifically , LaForge gave it to him , and that friendship becomes central to the crews survival . LaForges friendship with Data , however , gets tossed aside , and though LaForge and the others are quick to forgive and forget afterward , I 've never found it so easy to erase the images of Data as a sadistic murderer craving emotion and sensation more than any other aspect of what it means to be a human being . Datas behavior with the Borg Queen in First Contact seems subtle and reasonable compared with this . <p> Really , " Descent " is nobodys finest moment except Crushers I love getting to see her in command of the ship and I love that she puts her knowledge of experimental solar shielding to use , saving the ship and crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the ships doctor to be so interested in metaphasic shielding , yet now we see that she 's competent in all areas of science and technology aboard the ship , and if her leadership style is n't as polished as Picards or Rikers , its still both collaborative and decisive . Not so Picard this episode , whose reaction upon hearing about the change in the Borg collective is not relief that they 're no longer assimilating everyone they see , but anger at Riker as messenger and regret that he did n't  use Hugh to kill all the Borg when he had the chance . Admiral Nechayev comes aboard to make the same accusations Picard has already leveled against himself , and I really have to wonder why it took Starfleet so long to question him ; I would think that Picard would already have faced a board of inquiry for not striking against Starfleets deadliest enemy or at the very least for not bringing Hugh in to a starbase so other scientists could have the opportunity to learn from him . The state of war between Starfleet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings about having been Locutus have been resolved . Perhaps its this guilt that drives the captain to lead an away team into the heart of the crisis , where its actually a nice change to see that he cant do a thing . So often the crew faces disaster , then Picard shows up , makes a speech and saves the day . Here , no one is listening to his speeches , and LaForge and Troi do fine without him figuring out how to approach Data . <p> As plotting goes , this two-parter is a strong one most of the major cast members have significant things to do if not significant character development , and there 's well-paced action throughout . But there 's scant humor really , the funniest line in the two-parter is Datas explanation to Troi that in his quest to experience emotion , he watched two bad comedies , then tried porn , but nothing happened ( and Marina Sirtiss facial expressions are priceless ) . He s just made the discovery that he s turned on by killing , which is creepy and seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he decides hed kill Geordi just to experience that rush of emotion again I do n't  care whether his ethics program is being compromised and Lore is feeding him a carrier wave with emotion he does n't  know how to handle , he s had damage to his circuits before that have made him act out and he s been smart enough to have LaForge or Crusher figure out physically what 's going on . Emotion in Data seems to operate like a drugin fact , ironically , with emotions it becomes less possible to think of him as human and more as something to be switched on and off . Suddenly he s not Data but the android , presumably the only person on the ship who can be disabled or turned into a killing machine with a carrier wave . Suddenly Picard looks like a fool for letting his android spend time alone with an incarcerated Borg who knows his name . Some of the best episodes of this series have been about Datas personhood , in a personal sense , a legal sense , a social sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary side of artificial life forms , the Clone Wars/Terminator possibilities . " Descent " seems determined to ask whether we actually want someone like Data to have emotions . <p> Brent Spiner gives a wonderful performance as the villain , but his Data seems too much like Lore even after the ethical program is supposed to be working . I 'm more convinced by Lores declaration that he loves Data even though we know Lore to be a consummate liar and manipulator than I am by Datas halfhearted renunciation of emotion , something we know wo n't last , particularly after Generations and First Contact . Most of what we will see of Datas experiences with emotion are pretty dark , which to a large degree is true of Seven of Nine as well once she joins Voyagers crew . There 's little joy , no unrestrained hilarity , and love is always complicated and conflicted . Maybe that 's realistic or even inevitable for someone with little experience of emotion during formative years , but it makes me not look forward to episodes focusing on the development of such characters ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers , the idea that people are fundamentally generous and joyous , and will outgrow , both as individuals and as societies , any tendency toward prejudice or hatred . The Borg in " Descent " seem both diminished and even more horrifying they may have acquired some sense of individuality , but they are capable of expressing it only in terms of rage , jealousy , fear , scorneven what passes for patriotism is overwhelmed by darker elements , fervent worship of an elevated leader and loathing of all outsiders . Hugh may still feel friendship for Geordi , but in the vacuum left by Lore , will he be able to teach the others how to think and feel for themselves without destroying one another ? What sort of leader will Hugh become now that his inexperienced , childlike mind has had a taste of power ? He and Data have both called LaForge their friend , yet neither ever makes the sorts of leaps in the name of friendship that we take for granted from the supposedly unemotional Spock where Kirk and McCoy are concerned . It makes the ending feel rather hollow to me. 
@@58304500 @7304500/ <h> ' Endgame ' Cut Scenes Revealed <p> During the television production process , it is inevitable that changes are made to a script before the final version reaches our screens . ' Endgame , ' Voyager 's series finale , was no exception . <p> Courtesy of Barbara , we have obtained information on those scenes that did not make it into the final aired version of the episode , as well as an addition to the script that was made during production . While these scenes were apparently cut from the script even before filming started , they still provide interesting extra glimpses at some of the finale storylines . Full details on these cuts and the addition can be found below . <p> The AcademyOne of the episode 's early scenes , set twenty-six years in the future , features Admiral Janeway lecturing a group of Starfleet cadets on the Borg . In the final on-screen version of the episode , there is an exchange between a female cadet and the Admiral : <p> Cadet : " Admiral , some of us were talking before class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nine 's involvement with Unimatrix Zero ? " Adm . Janeway : " I 'd prefer not to discuss Seven of Nine . " Cadet : " Yes , ma'am . I 'm sorry .

Therefore , it may have been added to the episode in a later revision to the script , or during shooting . <p> The ShuttleAs part of her plan to send Voyager home early , Admiral Janeway travels to the past in a shuttle equipped with all the latest anti-Borg defence mechanisms . In one of the cut scenes , B'Elanna and Seven examine the shuttle 's specifications , but soon segue into a discussion about relationships . <p> Seven reveals that she entered the baby pool , a fact that surprises B'Elanna . " I 'm trying to broaden my participation in crew activities , " replies Seven . " My life would be so much easier if I never met Tom Paris , " B'Elanna jokes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeway &amp; ChakotayA key scene that did n't make it into the finale episode is the dinner with Captain Janeway , her counterpart from the future , and Commander Chakotay . During the meal , Admiral Janeway takes the opportunity to ask Chakotay about his love-life . <p> The dinner starts with a little prologue , set earlier in the day , with Admiral Janeway bringing some food to her younger self in the Ready Room . " You 're going to have to make some time to eat . You 're too thin , " chastises the Admiral . " It just hit me ... I 'm going to turn into my mother , " Janeway replies . <p> The setting then changes to later that evening , with Chakotay and the two Janeways talking about their adventures with the Rotenians . When Captain Janeway gets up to get more tea for the Admiral , she leans over and asks Chakotay about his personal life . When Chakotay acts surprised , the Admiral says " There 's no need to be coy with me , Chakotay . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously not keen to discuss this while his Captain is in the room .

" Chakotay smiles . " Great . " The script indicates that the Admiral is " warmed to see Chakotay at such a happy time in his life . " <p> The Briefing RoomA significant change also seems to have been made to the scene in the Briefing Room in which the crew decides on their plan to destroy the transwarp hub . Here 's the scene as it appears on-screen : <p> Tuvok : " Once inside , we 'd fire a spread of transphasic torpedoes . " Seven : " They 'd be programmed to detonate simultaneously .

After Seven changes the display , Tom says that this would send the crew " two thousand light-years further away from Earth . " <p> It should be noted that often scenes which do n't make the final version of the episode or film often appear in the novelisations , as in the case of ' Star Trek : Generations . ' The ' Endgame ' novelisation , written by Diane Carey , will be released next month , and may perhaps include some of the scenes above .

It 's certainly nothing like the horrors of the Bubonic Plague as described by Flint , who sounds as though he lived through it , one of the many clues that he is not merely a student of history but a time traveler of sorts . Yet Flint initially wants to force Kirk to leave without the means to cure the Enterprise crew , then demands to mine and process the necessary mineral himself , all to keep an eye on the men so he can be certain of keeping Rayna from them .

For a man who 's come close to living forever , he still seems to understand little about what sparks romantic love or makes it last . Whereas even a cranky Kirk , worried about his ship and snappish with his crewmates , can take the time for sensuality , to dance with a woman as though she 's his only care in the universe while leaving McCoy to fret about the antidote and Spock to gape at the Brahms manuscript that he may be the only person besides the composer ever to play . <p> Though his dilemma is essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan before he discovered that there were other Immortals - Flint is written as a Shakespearean tragic figure , whose language rises to the level of his pathos .

He tells Spock and McCoy that he identifies with Flint , " A very old and lonely man , and a young and lonely man ... we put on a pretty poor show , did n't we ? " Certainly he feels guilty for having forced Rayna into a choice she literally could not make , but Flint was equally responsible - or more so , since he was the one so insistent upon stirring her passions , then attempting to redirect them . <p> Yet what 's so remarkable about the ending is that the powerful , emotional storyline surrounding Flint and Rayna is overtaken by a much more familiar one . Spock is surprisingly emotional all episode , admitting to feeling envy at the rarities in Flint 's collection and lamenting that while the joys of love made Rayna human , the agonies of love destroyed her ... was it the fear of something similar happening to him that led him to attempt the disciplines of Kolinahr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McCoy comes in to report that Flint is dying and then makes an extraordinary speech , telling Spock that he feels sorrier for Spock than he does for Flint , " because you 'll never know the things that love can drive a man to ... the ecstasies , the miseries , the broken rules , the desperate chances , the glorious failures , the glorious victories . All of these things you 'll never know , because the word ' love ' is n't written in your book . " He leaves the room , and Spock places a hand on Kirk 's head and whispers , " Forget . " <p> What , precisely , is Spock telling Kirk to forget ? Surely not the entire encounter with Flint , for that is already a matter of Starfleet record , since the Enterprise has been accessing data about the man and his planet to determine their right to mine Ryetalin . It 's unlikely that Spock would have erased all memory of Rayna from Kirk 's consciousness since she played such a significant role in the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he loved her ? Or only the pain of having lost her ? Is this so different than what Spock 's half-brother does , in the canonically questionable and much-maligned Star Trek V : The Final Frontier , when he frees others from the pain that cripples them ... an offer to which Kirk responds that he would rather keep his pain , since it 's part of what makes him who he is ? Does Spock in fact tell Kirk to forget not Rayna at all , specifically , but Kirk 's sense of loneliness and isolation ? It taps right into the fear Kirk expresses in The Final Frontier that he will die alone . <p> But as Spock tells Kirk in that film , he was never at risk for that , because he was never truly alone ( a confession which inspires Kirk to reach out to embrace Spock , only to have Spock raise an eyebrow and gently remind him , " Not in front of the Klingons " ) . In fact , Kirk is rarely alone ; he has Spock and McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic love have failed him . And the same is true for Spock , who brought his closest friends to the Vulcan wedding never before shared with outworlders and cared more for their safety than his future bride . McCoy 's telling Spock that the word love is n't in his book is ludicrous ; Spock may never fall victim to the sort of romantic passion that leaves Kirk aching over a woman he barely knows , like Rayna or Lenore Karidian , but he knows all about love . He shows it in that " Forget , " whatever precisely he might have been instructing Kirk to release . <p> And yes , for any other old-timers out there who like me read Star Trek Lives ! in their formative preadolescent years , I borrowed that idea from Jacqueline Lichtenberg , Sondra Marshak and Joan Winston , and it has shaped my viewing of this episode - and the original Star Trek , plus all its sequels - ever after . In the years since , I have read academic studies and psychological analyses , books on the philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none ever made as much of an impact on me as that first book by fans for other fans . It was the volume where I discovered the existence of fan fiction , conventions and the wider network of the world of fandom , and when I pulled it out to find the exact quote about " Requiem For Methuselah " for this review ( on a page that I had dog-eared more than 25 years ago , and my son laughed at me when I showed him this ) , I remembered that reading this book was the moment when it hit me that Spock had always , obviously , visibly , profoundly had emotions , no matter how much press he got for logic . <p> Here , because I ca n't find it anywhere else online and it deserves to be linkable , is what Lichtenberg , Marshak and Winston said about " Requiem For Methuselah " and the relationship between Kirk and Spock : <p> They ... learned to trust each other with an absolute , bedrock certainty based on each one 's knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling friendship - even Spock did . They called it being brothers . Kirk would have been willing to call it a very special kind of love . <p> But it was Spock who did , however silently , actually call it love . One of the most moving scenes in all of Star Trek is the final one from ' Requiem for Methuselah ' ... McCoy , for once genuinely and totally failing to understand Spock , lectures him on the meaning of love , which he says that Spock will never know ... and leaves . Silently Spock crosses to bend over the sleeping Kirk , touching him to establish the Vulcan mind-meld . Aloud he says only , ' Forget . Forget . ' But the word is love .

The development of an outside-the-law secret section offers rich opportunities for storytelling , not just in terms of cloak-and-dagger intrigue but the possibility of introducing characters not bound by Starfleet 's code of ethics .

Unfortunately , neither Batanides nor Picard knows that both men are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romulans and classified information about the rulers of Chiaros . <p> As both agents work to recruit Lieutenant Hawk , the comfortable and confident young officer must weigh his responsibilities and decide whether to betray Section 31 to protect the Federation itself . For despite the covert organization 's vast intelligence network , neither Tabor nor Zweller understand the real reasons for the Romulans ' interest in Chiaros -- and by the time Picard has uncovered the scientific enigma at the heart of the crisis , the Federation is no longer welcome in the Geminus Gulf . The writers produce an admirable balance of action , character development and political intrigue over the course of the novel 's 350+ pages ; although the scientific mystery remains shrouded in technobabble throughout , it 's not really crucial to the story except as a catalyst for the unfolding drama . <p> Mangels and Martin do an admirable job depicting the negative consequences of Section 31 while making its members complex people with accessible personal agendas . Unfortunately , it 's difficult to make any character sound intelligent while parroting Sloan 's explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the argument runs that the Federation ca n't maintain its existence under its own peaceful charter , so it needs a top-secret division to break all its rules in the name of saving it , even if that division 's actions ( ranging from assassinations to stopping proto-warp civilizations from traveling into space ) violate everything the Federation represents . As Riker and Picard demonstrate in Rogue while dealing with an asylum request , it is possible to bend the rules -- even the Prime Directive -- without requiring a shadow government accountable to no one that makes the entire hierarchy of Starfleet and the diplomatic corps look like fools . <p> It 's also frustrating that the legitimate representative of Starfleet Intelligence , Batanides , ca n't seem to separate her roles as an outraged admiral , a betrayed friend and a grieving lover . Her fury against Section 31 has as much to do with personal losses as principle , which weakens her as a character and an advocate for the Federation . I 'm delighted that Mangels and Martin have developed Hawk as a gay character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm sorry the female characters in Rogue , even the Chiarosan planetary leader , seem so caught up in emotional issues rather than demonstrating the clear-headed thinking of Picard and Data . The captain and Riker are superbly characterized , with warmth and wit as well as lots of fun cultural references ( Picard remembering War of the Worlds , Riker and Hawk joking about Martian colonization ) . One wishes the confident , clever Troi of First Contact played a larger role in this story set mere months beforehand . <p> Rogue and Shadow both do a fine job illustrating the demoralizing dangers of Section 31 . One wonders why the group has n't assassinated Picard in order to prevent him from being a magnet for the Borg in his role as Locutus , particularly after reading Shadow , in which an unknown assailant tries to kill Seven of Nine in order to stop the ex-Borg from reviving her link to the Collective . Smith and Rusch set their novel shortly before the events of ' Equinox , ' perhaps to explain why Janeway acted like such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abusive treatment of crewman Noah Lessing makes even less sense in the wake of the discovery of a covert division of Starfleet that she abhors . Since Shadow is a Section 31 novel , it does n't take much insight on the reader 's part to guess the career path of Seven 's would-be assassin ; thus it 's a bit annoying to watch the crew fumble in the dark without a clue . Still , Janeway ends up sympathetic at the end as she uncovers the logs of her onboard spy and discovers what an idiot this agent believes her to be . <p> The novel starts with Voyager cliches -- the captain wants to divert from the all-important voyage home to examine a spatial phenomenon , and Torres is a bit miffed that Janeway has insisted on calling Seven away from her regeneration cycle because she wants another pair of eyes besides those of her chief engineer . Within moments , the cargo bay is rocked by an explosion , followed within hours by repeated attempts on the former Borg 's life . While Tuvok attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on saving the lives of millions of aliens on a ship from Rhawn , a planet that once orbited one of two stars on the verge of a stellar collision . Without stronger shields , the pre-warp vessel Traveler wo n't survive and its population will become extinct . Janeway decides there 's really no Prime Directive conflict because these people have obviously come looking for advanced civilizations -- an assessment with which one suspects Starfleet Intelligence as well as Section 31 might disagree , but no one on Voyager 's crew really tries . Voyager commits resources to helping the alien ship before the crew discovers discovering that their own computer has been compromised by whoever initiated the attacks on Seven . <p> The most entertaining parts of Shadow concern the monarch and people of Traveler , who despite their desperate situation seem better able to work together than Voyager 's Starfleet-trained crew . This is n't a problem with Smith and Rusch 's story but with Voyager itself -- the novel seems consistent with its late-fifth-season setting in terms of the characters ' lack of resourcefulness and passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's given a rare chance to perform his function on the ship and disable a threat to security ( though Seven of Nine of course resents the fact that she is n't in on the investigation , which she assumes she could conduct far more competently ) . Shadow does n't reflect any love for the Voyager crew , for Torres and Paris act like unprofessional brats holding hands in the briefing room , Janeway wonders whether irritation is the default setting for Seven 's face , Chakotay contributes nothing beyond acting as a sounding board for the captain . It 's more interesting to read about the immature but determined Rhawnian leader Aetayn and Travelers Lypsa and her daughter Andra , who have a bit in common with Voyager 's Samantha and Naomi Wildman . <p> At 250 pages , Shadow offers a lot less substance than Rogue in terms of both complexity and interest . It does n't help the drama when the identity of the Section 31 agent on Voyager gets revealed ; I did n't even remember the character , who appeared only once on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake but the fate of the Federation seems very far away , and it 's hard to worry too much about all the attempts to bump off Seven of Nine considering that on the series her wonder-nanoprobes have brought people back from the dead . The nanoprobes also make Voyager 's resident know-it-all the obvious person to explain the existence of Section 31 to Janeway , since Seven 's Borg database of assimilated intel makes her the only person on board with pre-existing information about the organization . Seven states that the Rhawnians have a Borg designation despite the fact that they never ventured off their planet until their sun began to die ; is there anything she does n't know more about or ca n't do better than everyone else ? Maybe that 's why a jealous Torres spends so much time giving orders to examine a sabotaged panel before she gets around to having an unconscious Seven beamed to sickbay . <p> Perversely , as I read Shadow and came to understand Section 31 's reasons for wanting to assassinate Seven , they made more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despicable nor any more logical -- it 's purely a reflection of my own frustration with Janeway 's inconsistency and Seven 's outrageous authority on her ship . Yet such mean , petty thoughts point out as well as anything just how dangerous Section 31 really is . An organization that stands for anarchy , sabotage and genocide can not possibly contribute anything positive to its universe . The mere suggestion of its existence undermines everything that 's progressive and optimistic about Star Trek . Armed with the personal prejudices and private resentments of which all human beings are capable , one unscrupulous individual like Sloan could bring down the entire Federation . <p> This is the eleventh installment in a series of regular book reviews Michelle Erica Green is writing for the Trek Nation .

They meet two beings , Korob and Sylvia , who appear to be human - well , Sylvia sometimes appears to be a cat - but they have remarkable powers , from the ability to turn Enterprise crewmember into obedient zombies to the ability to use sympathetic magic to make the ship overheat and trap it in a force field . Korob explains that they are from another galaxy and are supposed to be on a mission of investigation , but Sylvia enjoys the physical sensations available to her in the form of a human woman and tries to seduce Kirk to further explore her sensuality . When she figures out that Kirk has no feelings for her , she threatens to kill his entire crew . Korob helps Kirk escape , explaining that their power comes from a transmuter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries . He smashes the transmuter , forcing Sylvia and Korob back into their natural form as delicate blue insects that die in the harsh atmosphere of the planet and causing the zombified away team members retrieve their willpower . <p> Analysis : This is one of the very silliest storylines ever produced on the original series , yet it 's entertainingly played and visually unique . Spock hypothesizes that the particular haunted house into which the crew stumbles was created from their subconscious minds , guessing that Sylvia and Korob believed that they were accessing actual human places and memories rather than nightmares and fantasy , but one has to wonder which members of the starship 's crew are so terrified of the classic cliches of Western horror . As Kirk notes repeatedly , it 's a lot like Trick or Treat , which to most children is about the fun of exploring intimidating things like ghosts , skeletons and witches , not the terrors that made those things fearsome in the first place like superstitions about the Black Death and the hazards of childbirth in an era before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination when it comes to horror or Spock 's theory is just plain off . <p> Yet the episode begins on a somber , eerie note with a dead crewman and ends on a similarly dark tone , with the aliens expiring and Kirk expressing his unhappiness about Jackson 's senseless loss . It 's as if the writer and director could n't decide whether to go with the potential humor or try to stick to serious science fiction , resulting in a bit of a mess thematically . ( The comic elements are amplified helplessly on DVD ; the skeleton and dungeon accoutrements look extremely cheesy with the newly clear transfer , and it 's impossible to miss the puppet strings that animate the insectlike Sylvia and Korob at the end . ) <p> DeForest Kelley plays McCoy through much of the early episode as if he just ca n't quite take any of this seriously , not even the death - maybe that 's why he has to be zombified . Meanwhile Shatner plays gamely along for Kirk 's attempted seduction of Sylvia , disinterested in her cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real chemistry , perhaps because Sylvia is one of the strongest women with whom we have seen Kirk , and it 's hard to tell for awhile whether the captain remembers that this woman has killed a crewmember . <p> It 's hard to tell exactly what to make of the relationship between Korob and Sylvia . On some level he 's evidently jealous , though whether this is over her fearlessness , her ability to relish sensation or her bonding with another man , it 's hard to say . He has plenty of opportunities to rescue the Enterprise crew and get Kirk out of his hair before he decides that he must intervene in Sylvia 's plans , even though he 's already told her that she 's violating the very reasons they have come to study this galaxy . <p> If only we had some backstory !

Did Sylvia specifically want to attract more people down to the surface ? <p> Visually the gimmicks are cheap but fun ; my kids were amused by the black cat who sounds at all times like she needs to be fed , and the crew makes entertaining faces provided first with what looks like the start-of-term feast from Harry Potter that magically appears on the tables , then the plates of gemstones that replace it .

" I could squash you and that would be an interesting sensation , " announces Sylvia gleefully . Then , when she realizes that Kirk 's kisses are all for show , " There is no fire in your mind !

" <p> The giant stalking cat may be the oddest bad guy from whom the crew must flee , and it 's hard not to be sad about the smoking corpse of the bug-thing she later turns out to be , even if she is a heartless murderess . There really is not a lot of substance here to comment upon , but I 'm sorry we do n't get to know Sylvia better . Traces of her show up on the later series - she and The Next Generation 's Ardra are soul sisters - yet there 's not quite the same gleeful , shameless sensuality , accompanied by a certainty that she can and will have her way .

Below you 'll find the transcript of the Q&amp;A : <p> Sean Stephenson : Welcome to the LCARS : Federation Databank 's question and answer session with Mike and Denise Okuda . This Q &amp; A is in conjunction with our November Contest where you got to ask the question . We are very grateful for the opportunity afforded to us ; thanks from all of us , Mike and Denise . Now on to the questions . <p> Question #1 ( Favorite Question ) : Denise , Seeing as how one or your hobbies is tropical fish . I was wondering , did you pick out the fish in picards ready room ? The Reef tigerfish ? ( I think ) I know , I should n't push it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you answer this question as well ? ( if you have enough time in your already busy schedual ) What software program do you use to create the computer graphic displays ? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS ! GREAT WORK ! KEEP IT UP ! ! ! <p> The Okudas : No , the Australian Lionfish was originally selected by John Dwyer , TNG 's set decorator during the first season . After Dwyer left for movie assignments , Livingston became the responsibility of Jimmy Mees , who , like Dwyer , hired Mark 's Fish of Studio City to take care of his tank . We use Macromedia Director for most of our comptuer displays . <p> Question #2 : What was the origninal inspiration for the LCARS graphics ? Has Microsoft or any other major technology firm ever approached you about creating an OS based on the LCARS concept ? ? <p> The Okudas : The ST-TNG style of instrumentation and graphics came out of Gene 's request that the ship be extremely user-friendly . I interpreted this to mean that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've spoken informally with some friends at Microsoft for some project , although I do n't know what that is . I do n't think it 's an OS . <p> Question #3 : My question concerns the 1st season TNG episode " Conspiracy . " Nowhere , in *any* version of your Encyclopedias , is there an entry for the alien parasites who infiltrated Star Fleet . Other entries refer to them , but the " buggers " ( my pet name for them ) have no entry of their own . Is this an oversight ? Or perhaps it is part of the conspiracy .... ? ? ? Thanks , and keep up the great work ! ! <p> The Okudas : I think we simply could n't think of a " proper " name for them , and we intended to go back later and think of something , but in the inevitable deadline crunch , it got lost in the shuffle . We could ( and might ) add something if we ever do another edition , but there 's really no new information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's amazing that you 've been able to keep such a consistent look to the TREK computers over the years . However , do you think that it would theoretically be possible to design a computer system with that LCARS Graphical User Interface that would actually be comfortable to use ? It 's never entirely clear what the characters are actually doing on the show beyond pressing buttons , and the attempts that I 've seen to recreate this user interface in various web sites and multimedia reference products have been , at best , awkward . <p> The Okudas : The TNG panel graphics are intended to suggest something well-organized when a viewer sees them in the background of a scene . My advantage , of course , is that they are seldom seen closely , so I rarely have to take the time to figure out a panel in exact detail . As long as it looks credible on camera , I 'm okay . This is extremely valuable , because it could easily require ten or fifty times as much time ( and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the panels done in that kind of detail . The problem with actual software implementations of the style is that it requires far more than simply mimicking the colors and patterns . In order to work well , one has to analyze the tasks and the users ' needs in great detail . This is something that the software industry in general does poorly , in my opinion . One also sees the same kinds of issues in things that should be well-understood , like VCR controls and TV remotes . They are all elegantly designed , but the users ' needs are seldom adequately anticipated . On the show , I have the advantage that the viewer can assume that I 've anticipated the crew 's needs , simply because you can see how easy it is for the actors to use the controls . <p> Question #5 : Hi ! I was wondering , how are the actual graphics made for the video screens which we see on Star Trek ? Are they produced on computers ? or ... <p> The Okudas : Most of the on-set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director software . Most of the static backlit images are done with Adobe Illustrator . Jim Van Over creates most of the animated graphics on Voyager , while Wendy Drapanas does most of the static art . <p> Question #6 : This question is for Mike : There is a scene in Star Trek 5 that really bothers me ( not to mention all of the movie ) - when Kirk , Spock and McCoy are in the turboshaft and they start climbing . The deck numbers start at 1 and go to 70 ( i think ) . Anyway , from the Encyclopedia we know that the 1701-A did n't have that many decks . Also , the bridge has always been deck 1 . My question is this : did you ever have a conversation with William Shatner to say that this was incorrect ? I guess I 've assumed that you knew what you were doing based on all of your work but you were told that it did n't matter so just make the signage for 70 decks . Is this the case ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had other ideas . Bill is always open to suggestions , but he ( like any director ) reserves the final decision to himself . I disagreed with his choices , but once he made his decision , it was my job to implement it as quickly and efficiently as possible . <p> Question #7 : What is the greatest challenge in creating a fresh look in an established setting like the Star Trek universe ? <p> The Okudas : The limitations of time , money , techniques , and our own imaginations . <p> Question #8 : I heard that you integrate little funny sybols and texts into your designs , which are to small to see for the ordinary spectator on TV . Could you say something about these additions and did ever a producer or actor/actress comment on that , do they at all say something to your work ? <p> The Okudas : We do such things occasionally for our own amusement and for the amusement of the crew , but we try never to make them large enough to be visible on camera . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . Most cast members notice them , and they 've found them funny . <p> Question #9 : What was the first Idea for the **35;1793;TOOLONG ? <p> The Okudas : See #2 . <p> Question #10 : What kind of screens do you use for Voyager , the have no scanlines are with the animation , too good to be mockups . And if you do n't mind me askin ' how much are they ? <p> The Okudas : Most of the panels are simple back-lit art . The animated graphics are usually displayed on a variety of commercial video and computer monitors built into the set . They do have scan lines , but Marvin Rush , our director of photography , tries to shoot them so that we rarely see them . <p> Question #11 : Please , excuse my poor english . I 'd like to know if your work has some influence or if it is inspired by some Bauhaus style . <p> The Okudas : A little Bauhaus , an little art deco , I suppose . <p> Question #12 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life on the stage . I understand how the fancy images are digitally matted in , but how are the live gags pulled off ? <p> The Okudas : Mostly with on-set video . We use a variety of special systems to standards-convert our on-set video to 24-frames per second so that they can be photographed without a roll bar . Ben Betts is our on-set video engineer . He works closely with Denise and with Jim to make sure our video graphics look as good as possible . <p> Question #13 : What is the most difficult and the easiest thing about working with your spouse ? <p> The Okudas : It 's hard to leave work behind when we go home at night . We get to carpool together to work . <p> Question #14 : How long does it take to make each console for any of the Star Treks . I would also like to ask how long you have been doing this job . <p> The Okudas : It varies greatly with the importance of the console in any given shot , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three or four days to prepare the graphic art for a console in an episode . And this does n't count the job that the production designer , art director , set designer , and the construction department has to do to actually build the console . I 've been with Star Trek since 1986 . <p> Question #15 : Thanks for all the work you have put in over the years to make Star Trek the pre-eminent sci-fi series of our times , and one of the finest dramas too . Can you answer a question that has been batted backwards and forwards on alt.tv.start-trek.ds9 for months now ? What has happened to the DS9 sets ? Have they been destroyed , as some seem to think , or are they stored away neatly ( hopefully to be re-used ... ) ? <p> The Okudas : The DS9 sets were demolished immediately after the end of filming for the last episode . We 've saved a few pieces for possible use on Voyager . <p> Question #16 : Michael , your occupation seems to be both technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , an artist or a scientist ? <p> The Okudas : A designer with an interest in science . <p> Question #17 : The ships fired ( season 7 ) phasers while flying with Warp-Engines and they effected is n't that impossible , like it was written in technical manual ? <p> The Okudas : Star Trek 's technology has always been a little flexible to give the writers some leeway in storytelling . In some cases , we can try to rationalize such changes with technical explanations , but in other cases , we hope that no one will notice . ( But someone always does ! ) <p> Question #18 : How did you get the idea for the LCARS interface ? <p> The Okudas : See #2 and #4 . <p> Question #19 : Can you tell me what was the first episode of star trek ever made , What was it called , What was the year and the date try that one . <p> The Okudas : The first episode of Star Trek was " The Cage , " which was produced in 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okudagrams " shown on the various LCARS displays in the various Star Trek series . How did you design the panel displays on the CRT terminals with their touch pads ? Their multi-colored hierarchal orientation seems to be quite innovative and appropriate to the general theme of Star Trek . I would like to obtain an " Okudagram " for display in my Star Trek display at home . Is there a source where you offer them for sale ? P.S. De Kelly was an inspiration for me to pursue a career in medicine and am saddend by his passing . I was able to see him at a convention and was pleased to hear that obtained joy in the knowledge that he felt honored by his role in inspiring people to pursue this noble profession . <p> The Okudas : The original TNG display panels were done in 1987 with pen and ink and rub-on letters . This art was then photographed as very-large-format photographic transparancies . We now use programs like Adobe Illustrator on Macintosh computers to design the panels , which are output on large-format inkjet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase actual graphics from the sets . I had suggested this to the folks running the Star Trek store at the Las Vegas Star Trek Experience , but I do n't know what ever happened to the idea . DeForest Kelly was a wonderful man who took great delight in the fact that his role of Dr. McCoy helped inspire so many people into the medical profession . We miss him terribly . <p> Question #21 : My question for you is : What was the graphic/board/language most fun to work on ( both brainstorming and contruction ) ? <p> The Okudas : Probably the original series Enterprise bridge graphics in " Relics " ( TNG ) and " Trials and Tribble-ations " ( DS9 ) , mainly because of all the detective work required to re-create graphics for which we had no reference other than the videotapes of the episodes . <p> Question #22 : Have you ever considered making a collection of the different animations you 've created for the different series to be sold ( possibly as the REAL Star Trek Screensaver ) ? I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cross-platform ) . : - ) <p> The Okudas : I 've suggested this to our friends at Simon and Schuster Interactive and other licencees , but nothing has come of it . However , S&amp;SI did include some of our screen animation graphics in a CD-ROM product called STAR TREK : THE CAPTAIN 'S CHAIR , which is a detailed walk-thru of several starship bridges .

The Federation itself , represented by cautious President Jaresh-Inyo , finds itself in conflict with Starfleet , lead by the more alarmist Admiral Leyton .

@@58304516 @7304516/ <h> The Enterprise Incident <p> Plot Summary : When a short-tempered , irrational Captain Kirk orders the Enterprise into Romulan space , the ship is promptly captured by three Romulan vessels that could n't be detected on sensors until they were within firing range . Two Romulan hostages are exchanged for Kirk and Spock , who beam aboard the flagship and are accused of espionage . When Spock declares his belief that Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and craving for glory , the Romulan Commander accepts his explanation that Kirk is no longer sane , but a furious Kirk assaults Spock , who uses the " Vulcan Death Grip " to protect himself , killing the captain . But of course there 's no such thing as the Vulcan Death Grip , and while Spock distracts the female Romulan Commander by suggesting he might be seduced to remain with the Romulans - or with her , personally - McCoy surgically alters Kirk to look like a Romulan so that , wearing the uniform of one of the exchange hostages , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romulan vessels from the Enterprise . A transmission from Spock to Kirk with the device 's location leads to Spock 's capture and arrest , but Chekov is able to beam him back to the Enterprise before his execution . The Romulan Commander , who tried to throw herself into the beam to stop it , is also brought on board , and though she orders the destruction of the Enterprise , the cloaking device protects the ship until it has entered Federation space . <p> Analysis : This was my very favorite Star Trek episode during my youth - more than " The City on the Edge of Forever " , more than " Amok Time " , even more than " The Empath " - so I shall not even attempt objectivity , though there are things that have always made me roll my eyes like the fact that Romulan women 's uniforms are even more absurd than Starfleet women 's uniforms . Joanne Linville 's Romulan Commander was my favorite female Trek character until Kira , and watching " The Enterprise Incident " again after all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command of a fleet of ships ! She 's thoroughly unintimidated by Kirk and uncowed by his charming smile ! Yet she 's smart and tough without being the sort of sexless maternal figure that Kate Mulgrew fought hard to turn Janeway into during Voyager 's latter seasons , and her fingers-only erotic exchange with Spock is utterly scorching , all the more so because it 's so understated and underplayed yet leaves them both quivering . <p> Something 's off from the beginning , with Kirk stomping around the bridge insulting Chekov and grousing at the rest of the crew , so that by the time Spock declares him insane , it 's pretty obvious we 're watching something agreed upon and staged beforehand for precisely the reasons later declared - so that the Romulan incursion will be entirely on Kirk 's head and the crew may be spared any punitive actions , though these are more reasonable Romulans than the vicious ones from Balance of Terror , where the commander was a reasonable man but many of his crew were bloodthirsty and brutal . These Romulans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cloaking technology seriously , and the Commander assumes that Spock will be easily enticed away from his previous loyalties . It also does not seem to occur to them that , once the cloaking device has been stolen , the Starfleet officers may be able to install and use it immediately . This is their weakness , and watching Kirk and Spock play on it is highly enjoyable because unlike all the noble savages they encounter - and the just-plain-savages - these people are worthy adversaries . <p> And because we know more than they do , the episode manages to be funny while it 's also thrilling . Shatner 's over-the-top style works perfectly in this scenario , as he rants that Spock is a filthy liar and shouts , " I 'LL KILL YOU ! " which fits in with Romulan expectations of overly emotional , uncontrolled humans . Summoned to the Romulan ship to take care of him , McCoy announces , " I do n't make house calls . " Though he 's apparently not in on the plot , he picks up right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " uses the Vulcan Death Grip on the captain , McCoy manages to quip , " Well , your instincts are still good , Mr. Spock - he 's dead ! " ( He also has the last word of the episode , reminding Kirk that he needs to bob his ears unless Kirk wants to go through life looking like his first officer . ) The three main characters work in such lovely synchronicity here even though they do n't quite know what each will have to do to pull off this plot . Kirk is apparently polite enough not to ask Spock how the Romulan Commander came to be wearing that negligee , and he does offer to let Spock escort her to her quarters after the mission is over . <p> But oh , that affair that is not to be ! The Romulan Commander is clearly interested in Spock right from the start , when she notices him on the Enterprise bridge and invites him to beam over with the captain via an invitation from Subcommander Tal . She speaks of the common roots and origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the original series and not fully explained for a generation ; " We can appreciate the Vulcans , our distant brothers , " she tells Kirk . Though her appreciation for Spock is decidedly not fraternal . She offers him various forms of Romulan ale ; she tries to recruit him not only by insisting that someone of his capabilities should have his own ship , but by trying to appeal to his artistic and aesthetic sensibilities , using herself as representative of all that he might enjoy in Romulan culture . When he confesses that he is half-human - a rather surprising admission , since this is something he has tried to downplay on the Enterprise and which could cost him her interest - she tries to appeal to his emotional nature as well , and offers him something she considers similarly intimate : her first name . <p> Spock 's reciprocal seduction is effortlessly sophisticated , soft-spoken , intense ; I was always more of a Kirk girl than a Spock girl but " The Enterprise Incident " offers an undeniable display of his appeal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable with no more than a suggestion that her beautiful name is incongruous with her military uniform , then declares almost breathlessly that her attire is not only more appropriate , but should actually stimulate their conversation , with an emphasis on " stimulate . " Then he echoes the Vulcan ritual bonding finger-touching that we first witnessed between Sarek and Amanda in " Journey to Babel " , but this is n't a chaste greeting between husband and wife ; it 's a prelude to whatever sort of emotional or mental connection they form when they touch one another 's faces , and while it is possible to believe that Spock is faking it in the moment to buy Kirk time to steal the cloaking device , he makes clear at the end of the episode that he considers it neither artificial nor casual . <p> Kirk has a great many flings with a great many women over the course of Star Trek , but they 're really never a bonding between equals : we see him either with child-women like Shahna and Rayna , with intelligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with clever vixens whom he puts in their places like Sylvia and Deela . Spock 's other romances are even more painful , the pining Leila , the drippy Droxine , and Zarabeth who gets him only because he 's stopped being the Spock we know . Not counting the tease of Kirk 's forced kiss with Uhura , the Romulan Commander is the one truly worthy love interest all series , and it 's that much more enticing because she 's an antagonist , an adversary . We do n't really want Spock to defect and join her , yet somehow she does n't look foolish for believing that he might . Nor does he look foolish for appearing momentarily regretful , when she demands to know how he could betray her , that he must define himself first and foremost as first officer of the Enterprise . <p> Joanne Linville is unforgettable as the Romulan Commander , and her chemistry with both Shatner and Nimoy is such that her character has formed lasting bonds in Bantam and Pocket Books fiction with both Kirk and Spock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names that I know of , and three distinct backstories , in official fiction based on the series , though the fan fiction , particularly Kathleen Dailey 's Unspoken Truth ( one of my favorite fan novels in more than 25 years of reading them , though I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone underage ) . There are so many moments in this episode I love : Scotty 's proclamation of loyalty to Kirk ( " And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the Enterprise , it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us " ) , his huffy refusal to go to sickbay when McCoy demands his presence ( " We 're surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us .

@@58304518 @7304518/ <h> ' World Enough and Time ' <p> By Michelle Erica GreenPosted at August 28 , 2007 - 9:23 PM GMT <p> The latest Star Trek : New Voyages episode , " World Enough and Time , " has raised the bar not only for fan productions but for future professional productions of Star Trek . I 'm a lifelong fan of the original series , which is roughly my contemporary , and this episode holds up respectably next to much of that show 's third season . It also gives George Takei more to do as Sulu than any of the original episodes and most of the films , plus it has Grace Lee Whitney in a cameo as Janice Rand . I ca n't help missing the original cast - executive producer and lead actor James Cawley is n't William Shatner , though thankfully he avoids the excesses of parody and plays Kirk slightly differently . But even so , this new episode held me riveted in a way that few episodes of the later series did . <p> I 'll tell the truth : Before " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan-made episode of Star Trek all the way through . This is partly because I have trouble watching anything on my computer screen that 's longer than the length of a music video without getting a headache , but it 's also partly because no single episode has ever grabbed me and made me want to watch the whole thing in spite of the headache . ( Bootleg episodes of Torchwood , for instance , managed to do so . ) " World Enough and Time " is well worth risking a headache to see , though I had the good fortune to watch a DVD copy of it . It 's possible that I missed some glitches in the online version , but I can report that the visuals on a widescreen TV are breathtaking -- much better than any original series episode and the equal of most Enterprise episodes . <p> The story , co-written by Next Gen writers Michael Reaves and Marc Scott Zicree , follows Sulu as he reflects on the bridge of the Excelsior ( brilliantly recreated here ) about an incident from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Star Trek 's legendary spatial anomalies , Sulu and crewmember Lisa Chandris left the ship in a shuttlecraft searching for a solution . While only minutes passed aboard the Enterprise before Scotty attempted to retrieve the crewmembers , 30 years passed for Sulu -- during which time he and Chandris , believing themselves marooned on a wild planet they named Caliban , had a daughter named Alana before Chandris 's death . <p> Though Scotty is able to beam the much-aged Sulu back to safety , Alana 's pattern is partially trapped on Caliban because of the spatial anomaly . Sulu has two dilemmas : he may only be able to recall how to save the ship from the anomaly by reverting to his younger self , which will make him forget Alana , and there may be no way to free the ship from the increasing danger from the anomaly without losing Alana 's degrading transporter pattern . Meanwhile , Kirk -- naturally ! -- begins to fall for the beautiful young woman , a situation about which Sulu has decidedly mixed feelings . The resolution is bittersweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another character whom I was delighted to see return . <p> Story-wise , the episode reminded me of " The City on the Edge of Forever , " " The Inner Light " and " Flashback , " each of which was among the best installments of the original series , Next Gen and Voyager respectively . I was also extremely impressed with Zicree 's direction , including an overhead shot of the bridge and a shaky shuttlecraft ride that made me laugh out loud as the characters shook around original series-style . The performances seem a tad uneven , perhaps because some of the recasting of classic roles is so on-the-nose that the actors doing more original takes on the characters look a bit off to me ; Andy Bray 's Chekov and Julienne Irons ' Uhura are so bang-on echoing Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols that Jeffery Quinn 's Spock is more visibly distracting for his lack of physical resemblance to Leonard Nimoy . ( I wonder if I 'll have the same issues with Zachary Quinn . ) <p> John Lim , who plays the younger Sulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures and facial expressions as the older Sulu , but this is Takei 's episode , and with the exception of a mind-meld sequence that contains all the original series ' typical hyper-emoting , he gives a subtle , rich , moving performance . The writing offers lovely moments for all the actors - humor between Chekov and Sulu , Kirk and Spock bantering about their interdependence , Uhura 's warmth , McCoy 's frustration with logic , Scotty 's miracle working . <p> " World Enough and Time " will be hosted on the New Voyagesweb site once the site recovers from the technical problems that plagued the planned Thursday night premiere . Both the episode and the premiere , hosted at The Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills with Takei , will be available for download this week .

@@58304526 @7304526/ <h> Retro Review : Time and Again <p> Janeway and Paris get caught in a subspace fissure and thrown back in time one day before a cataclysm that will wipe out all life on a planet . <p> Plot Summary : At the same moment that Voyager is rocked by a shock wave from an explosion , Kes wakes with a vision of the inhabitants of a dying world . When Voyager scans the nearby planet , the crew finds that the entire population has been killed by a massive polaric energy discharge . During the investigation , Janeway and Paris fall into a subspace rift and find themselves in the past , hours before the disaster . While Chakotay orders Kim and Torres to find a way to communicate with the missing crewmembers , Janeway and Paris disguise themselves as natives and attempt to discover whether they can use the polaric energy conduits that power the planet to get them back to their own time . Paris wants to warn the people they meet of the impending disaster , but Janeway tells him that the Prime Directive forbids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skirmish between the authorities guarding the energy facilities and dissidents who oppose the dangers of polaric energy , and are captured by the dissidents , who believe they are spies from the government . After Janeway learns that the dissidents intend to move up the time of their planned intervention to moments before the disaster , she realizes that Voyagers arrival may already have disrupted the planets timeline by forcing the dissidents to rush a planned act of sabotage . Believing that the dissidents intervention must be the cause of the explosion , she tries to warn the authorities . Paris is shot in the ensuing struggle . Following the dissidents into the power facility , Janeway tries to stop them from accessing the planetary power supply . At that moment , Torres activates an energy beam to try to locate Voyagers missing crewmembers through the subspace fissure . Janeway realizes that her own crews rescue attempt will cause the polaric energy discharge and uses her phaser to cut off the beam . As subspace fractures , the timeline resets , and no one remembers the incident except Kes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewscreen to prove that her vision was only a nightmare . <p> Analysis : As much as I enjoy the character development in Voyagers early episodes , it was pretty silly of the writers to kick off the show with two time travel paradoxes , particularly this second one in which all the positive crew interactions are erased as the explosion timeline disappears . All that remains canonically is Paris being a selfish player who does n't  take Kims relationship with his girlfriend seriously , and Kes having supernatural gifts that unfortunately resemble some of the more ludicrous empathic powers of Deanna Troi . Overall , nearly everything about " Time and Again " feels like a Next Gen script repurposed for Voyager , right down to the captain being annoyed by a meddling child and the first officer and most logical crewmember having an argument about the captains interpretation of the Prime Directive . Some of the more obvious issues that might come up for discussion , such as Chakotays unswerving focus on retrieving the captain against whom several of his Maquis crewmembers would like to mutiny and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a moment of attention . Janeways recitation of the purpose of the Prime Directive sounds just like what Picard would say ; there 's no trace of Kirks sense of personal responsibility and belief that if he s in a position to avert a disaster , perhaps that 's what he s meant to do . Chakotay , too , very much resembles Picard in command in this story , and as much as I like that he listens to everyone on the crew , even Kes and her irrational-sounding intuitions , its hard to see where he developed such a style in the Maquis , where there surely was n't time to sit down and come to a consensus before every firefight or act of sabotage . I get the impression that the writers threw broad outlines at the actors and hoped that the performances would fill in the gaps , which might work with really strong , original , action-packed science fiction stories but does n't  work so well in talky episodes where even the aliens look and act like humans . <p> Which is not to say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are among my favorites despite the anomalies of the week . There 's immediate , believable chemistry among most of the cast members , something it took nearly a full season for Next Gen to develop and was spotty on Deep Space Nine until the writers had figured out which of the stations inhabitants made for valuable recurring guest stars . I may not like Paris focusing on snagging the Delaney Sisters before someone else gets to them , but I do appreciate seeing him take a bullet for a child , and he and Kim have a nice rapport in their scenes together . Its also nice to see Kim and Torres working together on a scientific problem , since their previous interaction at the hands of the Caretaker mostly involved her trying to pump him up and him trying to calm her down . There 's the complete delight of getting to know the Doctor , who makes it clear in " Time and Again " that he does , in fact , have a programmed sense of humor and his sarcasm is not just a quirk of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Voyage of the Damned , " he announces upon learning that the captain is missing , after which he assures Kes whose species he has never encountered before that she has a lovely brain . The crew spends so much time alternately being relentlessly perky , as if they werent lost 70,000 light years from home , and being unhappy/afraid/troubled , which could happen to anyone who kept bumping into spatial anomalies , that its a pleasure to have one character who 's snarky and aggrieved purely by nature . The tension between Chakotay and Tuvok is interesting to watch since it will never completely go away ; their personal styles and priorities are just too different , and they 're a bit competitive about guessing what Janeway would do , since Tuvok would like her to be a captain who prioritizes Starfleet values while Chakotay always tends to put people and their suffering above the letter of the law . <p> At this early stage , Neelix and his bombast remain a bit of an irritant , and its hard to know what to make of Kes ( " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced " ) . I feel like most of what I like about her can be credited to Jennifer Liens understated performances , not to her scripted dialogue . Its nice that Chakotay does n't  dismiss her extraordinary abilities until he has some proof that they 're genuine , but its also not clear how listening to her helps him or the crew . Which leaves Janeway , who has a decidedly mixed outing . Yes , I love a captain who 's hands-on enough to go on away missions ; no , I do n't  think its very smart to enter potentially life-threatening situations when her top priority is supposed to be finding a way to get her crew home . Its a pleasure to watch her on the planet , first trying to solve the scientific problem of their time displacement , then trying to talk her way around the dissidents and government officials , and finally having to work on her own after Pariss injury as she slowly comes to realize that her own crew may be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is a lot like the one in " Caretaker , " in which she 's aware of the Prime Directive but also aware that merely by being there , she and her people are already involved in events that could end in a holocaust . Janeways behavior when no one on her crew can see her is very much like her behavior when they can she 's not concerned about her ability to defend herself , she does n't  look for backup , and she has no problem giving orders to aliens , whether friends or foes . It may be a fairly silly storyline , which makes Janeway look more silly than one would hope for spending time and resources getting involved you 'd think by now shed start to realize that any attempt to study a situation may constitute interference but she acquits herself well during the action . But without any sort of payoff , even a momentary discussion of whether volatile polaric ions could help Voyager get home , " Time and Again " ends up feeling like waste of time and energy .

Raised in Philadelphia , de Lancie attended the Juilliard School , worked at the American Shakespeare Festival and appeared in dozens of films and television shows , perhaps most memorably as Eugene Bradford on Days of Our Lives before he became known for Star Trek . He has numerous other genre credits , including Stargate SG-1 and the original Battlestar Galactica , and has also been involved in many theatrical productions as an actor , director and producer .

If everybody 's funny , then you become serious . <p> Trek Nation : I know that Picard was always the straight man to Q , whereas with Janeway , they had a more flirtatious relationship . Was one more fun to play than the other ? <p> John De Lancie : Probably Picard was more fun to play against .

I started reading late , as a kid , and I really did n't pick up my first book until I was fourteen or so . <p> Trek Nation : Kind of like what Harry Potter is to a generation now . <p> John De Lancie : Exactly . Mine was Jules Verne and H.G.

I know a lot of people think sci-fi on television has gotten a lot darker . <p> John De Lancie : I tend to like darker sci-fi . I never was a big fan of didactic sci-fi . But I also think it 's one of these instances where the canvas , which up until let 's say the end of the ' 60s was Westerns , and then we went through a whole period of cops and doctors and what have you ... then the canvas became science fiction .

Or an omnipotent being - you have to be the omnipotent being who 's too stupid to know it , the omnipotent being with the feet of clay , or the omnipotent being who has a real self-image problem . You try to fracture it as much as possible . <p> Trek Nation : Did the casting people tell you what it was in you that made them say , ' This is the person to play God opposite Patrick Stewart ' ? <p> John De Lancie : Well , I know that Bobby DeNiro auditioned for it and did n't get it ... no , I 'm teasing !

That 's when you say ' Okay ' ... you do n't look any further . <p> Trek Nation : Was that a role you got pretty quickly ? <p> John De Lancie : I was working at the Mark Taper Forum doing a play with Donald Moffatt , and we were getting ready to go off to Japan .

Under duress , Picard agrees only on the condition that Q stop meddling with his ship . Riker and an away team are promptly taken to the surface of a planet , where they are forced to relive a battle from the Napoleonic Wars with animalistic humanoids . As crewmembers start dying , Riker discovers that he has been given the power of the Q.

But it chickens out at the critical moment , when Riker , given the opportunity to play God , demonstrates lack of both ingenuity and ambition , and that not only makes it mediocre , it diminishes everyone involved ... except , oddly enough , for Q himself , despite a departure worthy of " The Squire of Gothos " himself , Trelane from the original series .

Absolutely nothing worth watching ! He lacks the ambition of Gary Mitchell , though for a few minutes , when he 's calling the captain " Jean-Luc " and suggesting that the laws governing mere mortals no longer apply to him , it appears that there might be some hope . But his surefire plan to bestow bliss upon his crewmates not only demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of what makes them tick , even the ones he claims to know well . It also proves to us as a viewing audience that halfway through the first season , the TNG writers still scarcely have a clue what these people are about ! Wesley sometimes wishes he were taken seriously like an adult ? Duh . Geordi dreams of being able to see the faces of his crewmates and be free of the VISOR that gives him headaches . Double duh . Worf feels isolated as the only Klingon on a ship of humans ? Lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us this in the very first episode ! <p> Riker 's idea of providing " companionship " for Worf is to invent an animalistic Klingon woman who communicates in growls instead of speech and tries to smack Worf around , which probably says much more about Riker than about Worf ... particularly since Worf points out that apart from the initial porn value , he has nothing in common with such a creature and no use for a mate who 's none except in the most physical sense of the word . And I find it extremely telling that Riker makes no effort to answer the age-old question of what women want . He implies that Crusher would choose selfless medical knowledge like any good doctor ( I 'd expect exactly the same of McCoy , Bashir , and Phlox , though Voyager 's holographic doctor might have received Data 's gift instead ) . But Riker 's onetime love Troi is conveniently absent for his foray into godhood , and Yar , once again , gets nothing to do ...

We know in retrospect that Q 's real fixation is on the captain , not his first officer - Q later reveals that if he knew Picard could be tempted by the fairer sex , he would have come to him as a woman , and later still Q shows up in Picard 's bed - but here the best banter is saved for Riker , save for the marvelous scene where Patrick Stewart and John de Lancie quote Shakespeare at one another as if competing to see whether the traditional British or maverick American version of one of the most famous soliloquies in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet 's glorious " What a piece of work is man !

And it 's interesting to watch Riker appear ( and be called ) arrogant as he begins to take on characteristics we quite naturally take for granted in a starship captain , calling everyone by their first names , summarily dismissing them and suggesting that some rules were meant to be bent , if not broken . Clearly Riker lacks the cruel streak of so many super-humans ( not just Trelane and Mitchell but Henoch , Khan , et al ) , yet his model for how a human who has fulfilled his potential seems to be Picard . He does n't quite get what 's wrong with trying to fulfill people 's wildest dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty feeble . Wesley 's not being ready for something he will achieve soon enough is one thing , but Data would feel phony as a human ? How does he know that without trying it ? <p> It 's so frustrating that " Hide and Q " fails to hit the mark because it comes so close , more so than any earlier installment . It asks big questions without becoming obnoxiously talky or sanctimonious .

@@58304533 @7304533/ <p> For those anxiously awaiting the next installment of the post-finale Deep Space Nine storyline the wait is finally over , and it was well worth it . Following in the footsteps of Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Volume One ( June 2004 ) , readers can enjoy a double dose as both Volume Two and Three hit bookstores in February . <p> The Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine volumes are intended to immerse the reader in the cultures of the planets most closely associated with Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and allow the reader to experience those societies from a familiar character 's point of view . At the same time , these volumes advance the post-finale storylines . In Volume Two , the worlds explored are Trill in " Unjoined " by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels and Bajor in " Fragments and Omens " by newcomer J. Noah Kym . <p> At the end of Unity , Trill society stands on the edge of an abyss . The parasites have been destroyed but the ramifications of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trill society . " Unjoined " begins with Dr. Julian Bashir in the middle of bedlam and then proceeds to explain how he got there , how the chaos he and Ezri Dax find themselves caught up in came to be . <p> " Unjoined " is a beautifully constructed story that explores Trill 's previously hidden history by carefully taking into account everything previously established about the planet and it 's culture and expanding upon it in a very creative and interesting way . With the very fabric of their civilization being torn apart , the inhabitants of Trill find themselves in a desperate fight for the future of their society , a fight they may be unable to win . <p> " Fragments and Omens " has a much more hopeful tone . Set shortly after Bajor 's admission to the Federation there is still much work to be done helping Bajor become a fully integrated member of the Federation . J. Noah Kym successfully employs several different storylines and characters to weave together a descriptive and evocative story that provides the reader with a much broader picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in the past . <p> You are likely to feel a bit lost if you attempt to read any of the volumes of Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine without having read the previously published novel Unity . The six stories contained in these three volumes are in many respects an interlude . They carry the story forward from Unity , wrapping up some of the ongoing storylines not fully concluded in that novel while introducing new story threads . At the conclusion of both " Unjoined " and " Fragments and Omens " , the characters have been brought to the point where they are ready to move forward with their lives leaving the reader eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold . <p> As enjoyable and satisfying as the four previous stories told in Volumes One and Two of Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine are , Volume Three saves the best for last and packs quite a punch . Volume three brings together the Ferenginar story , " Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed " by Keith R.A. DeCandido , with the final tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by David R. George III . <p> In " Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed " , it comes as no surprise to learn that Quark is not the only Ferengi who is not pleased with direction that the recent reforms is taking their society . When Grand Nagus Rom finds himself in the middle of a no holes barred fight for his political future , Rom and Ro Lauren accompany Quark home to Ferenginar in an attempt to get to the bottom of serious accusations leveled against Rom . <p> With " Satisfaction is No Guaranteed " Keith DeCandido demonstrates that he knows his Ferengi every bit as well as the Klingons with a serious story that still manages to be rousing good fun . The predicament Rom finds himself in is uniquely Ferengi as is the solution . <p> " Olympus Descending " is a different kettle of fish entirely , an introspective tale that explores the nature of the changelings existence . While Odo and his search for answers about his people and their history may be the focus of the story , the author also manages to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , adding a good deal to our understanding of both species . <p> The story starts slowly , evolving into a tale that is entirely engrossing and at times shocking . The author pulls off more than one very neat little writing trick with great expertise . David George 's writing style strives to allow the reader to wholly immerse themselves not only in the events and surroundings that the characters are experiencing , but also to illuminate how they feel about it , and what the ramifications for them may be . Your mind tends to linger over the prose , savoring the words and the images those words provoke . <p> Each of these volumes has the " acknowledgements " and standard " about the author " sections run before each story , instead of at the end of the book as they usually do and there is a very good reason for that . Many readers read those sections before they begin a book and in the case of these stories , most particularly this final volume , turning to the back might mean you inadvertently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't turn to the back of the book , not even to peruse the included chronology of events . Save it for last and savor the bombshell . <p> You ca n't really characterize Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Volume Three as a conclusion ; these books are after all , not a trilogy . Rather they are three books that feature six separate stories that are part of one larger whole . However , you can easily characterize Worlds of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Volume Three , indeed all three volumes , as an outstanding addition to this bestselling series .

@@58304552 @7304552/ <h> Retro Review : Shadows and Symbols <p> While Sisko tries to learn what the Prophets expect from him , Kira refuses to cooperate with the Romulans and Worf fights for Jadzias afterlife . <p> Plot Summary : Ezri Dax introduces herself to the Siskos , explaining that she never wanted to be a host , but when the Dax symbiont began to decline , she was the only Trill on the ship with whom Dax could be joined . She asks to join the family on their trip to Tyree , which cheers up Sisko , though Ezri is space-sick and having trouble reconciling Daxs thoughts with her own . While searching for the Orb of the Emissary , Sisko begins to hear a voice paging a doctor and has visions of himself as Benny Russell , struggling in a mental hospital to finish a story that the doctor tells him is the cause of his mental instability . Back on the station , Kira tells Admiral Ross that Bajor will take any steps necessary to stop the Romulans from putting weapons on a Bajoran moon and sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluffing because Starfleet wont fight its Romulan allies . Odo agrees with Ross that the Romulans may indeed shoot Bajoran ships while Starfleet does nothing , but goes with Kira to confront an incoming group of Romulan ships carrying supplies for the weapons . Meanwhile , Weyoun urges a drunken Damar to get the shipyards to increase their output , while Worf and Martok joined by Bashir , OBrien , and Quark , who wishes to honor Jadzias memory prepare to attack those same shipyards by firing weapons into a nearby star , triggering a plasma ejection . JemHadar ships attack them , but OBrien is able to set off the desired reaction and the shipyards burn in the solar ejection as Worf chants prayers to send Jadzias spirit to Stovokor . On Tyree , Dax reminds a confused Sisko that he must retrieve the Orb , and in his vision , Benny writes that Sisko opens the box containing it . As he does so , energy shoots into space and ejects the pah-wraith from the wormhole . Sisko has a vision of his birth mother , who explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the body of the human woman to ensure that Sisko would be born to save the Celestial Temple . When Odo tells Kira that the wormhole has been restored , she takes it as a sign from the Prophets not to back down ; she prepares to fire on the Romulans , but Ross insists that Cretak comply with Bajoran demands and turn the ships around , which Cretak does . The Emissary returns to a rejoicing station , and Ezri greets all of Daxs friends , including Worf . <p> Analysis : I thought " Shadows and Symbols " was pretty much perfect when it first aired , and now I think its what 's better than perfect ? Sublime ? Transcendent ? Simultaneously , we get to see who Kira is when she winds up in command someone who becomes Bajors ferocious protector , who terrifies a Starfleet admiral and who Sisko is when he must confront what we all now know to be his messianic birthright . Except for people blessed ( or cursed ) with great faith and perhaps great ego , must of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we are , why were here , what were supposed to do with our lives . Just look at Ezri , who thought she knew who she was an assistant ships counselor , a Trill who felt complete and fulfilled without needing to become host to a symbiont then the universe threw her a mighty curve ball . No wonder she grabs Siskos baseball and tries to toss one right back ! Shes suffering from space sickness , paralyzed by memories of dying horribly in another body , ordering drinks she personally ca n't stand , cut adrift from almost everything she had thought was really important , including her family and closest friends . How lucky that she 's still a Starfleet officer and still a person of action rather than introspection ; its a great way to reintroduce her to her old friends and to a viewing audience . Then there 's Odo , literally transformed by love , comfortably wearing the humanoid form that for many years felt like an impersonation to him , while Worf , Bashir , Quark all of Jadzias intimates have to figure out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she would want them to do because they can no longer ask her . Even Kira glows with relief when she believes she 's been given a sign from the Prophets that her path is the right one , when the responsibility for the lives of Bajorans in the blockade , not to mention the alliance between the Federation and Romulans , no longer feels like it falls to her alone . <p> But Sisko ? Now he knows that he s never been alone , he s never existed without purpose . All the painful , horrible things he s suffered , the loss of his wife , the exile to a remote space station , the tragedies of war , the death of Dax , very literally shaped his path to put him where he was supposed to be at a critical moment of destiny . Of course part of him deeply resents this , learning that what he believed were his own choices were to a large extent fated , but a part of him must be exultant . Imagine having absolute proof that your life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the right ones ! No wonder Sisko returns to the station with a smile on his face . Like Benny Russell , who may be a figment of Siskos imagination or vice versa , Sisko knows with his whole being that he is doing the right thing . I love the reminder that Sisko may still be the butterfly dreaming he s a philosopher , the struggle with the condescending doctor who has Damars face and voice . Ezri may be trained in psychiatry like the doctor in Siskos vision , but she also knows Sisko ; she does n't  think he s crazy , she thinks he needs to follow his destiny , just as both Jake and Joseph Sisko do , even though they do n't  understand it and have been personally scarred by it . If I have a complaint about " Shadows and Symbols , " its that we never learn enough about Siskos mother or his feelings about learning how the Prophets violated her , as well as his father , to ensure his birth . There are overtones of all the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can take advantage of her and father children by her , except in this case its a womans mind instead of her body that 's altered , plus a man is seduced under false pretenses by the being sharing the womans existence . For the remainder of the series , Siskos mother primarily appears as a prophet of doom of sorts , and I 'm not happy that this family-oriented man does n't  do more to learn about the woman who gave birth to him , now that he knows she exists . Maybe he could n't bear to think about whether he would exist without such manipulation . The Virgin Mary may have been pious and accepted an unsought pregnancy as the will of God , but Siskos parents seem to have been resentful , which casts a pall over the poignant scene in which Sisko confronts the Prophet who made him . <p> I 'm not usually a big enthusiast about Klingon stories or space battles , so I 'm not as excited by Worf and Martoks quest to get Jadzia into Stovokor with the help of two men who belated realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who ca n't bear to let one of the other two go into danger without him , though as is so often the case , it turns out to be that third man whose engineering skills save the day . Poor Quark gets stuck trying to be the comic relief in a situation that really is n't funny , so his pleas for some appreciation from Worf for putting up with bad gagh only make Worf more sympathetic when he apologizes to the others for failing to appreciate their importance to Dax . Nicole de Boer does a wonderful job demonstrating that Ezri is still Dax , though clearly not Jadzia ; her vocal inflections are often very similar to Terry Farrells , though Jadzia never had the edge of hysteria that we hear at times in Ezri . Think how much she will learn from Kira , who is utterly glorious in this story arc , showing both the Romulans and Starfleet that they can never again take Bajor for granted or try to push Bajorans around . Ostensibly she 's acting as the head of the militia , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than either Shakaar or Bareil , and the man she 's with now is a better match for her than either of those previous partners , impressive as their resumes might have been . Odo is n't afraid to criticize or mock her , to offer unwanted advice , to give her warnings she does n't  really need , yet at vital moments his ego disappears , he is entirely at ease taking her orders and following her lead , and his support never wavers even when he thinks her choices may lead to both their deaths . That stand-off with the Romulans had me biting my nails more than Benny Russells with the doctor , and its glorious that all the storylines converge at the moment the Prophets return to power in the Celestial Temple the wormhole reopens , as Weyoun wanted , just at the moment he loses all the ships he might have deployed to launch an attack because of Martok and Worfs triumph , reminding Ross what is at stake if he does n't  support his Bajoran allies as well as the Romulans , allowing Sisko to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the living as well .

Not necessarily religious faith , but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how dismal or dark things may seem , somehow we can make it better faith . Cathedral utilizes compelling and emotive language and imagery to drive the point home and to lay the groundwork perfectly for the final chapter of this unsurpassed story . <p> Lesser Evil brings this long arc full circle and left me grinning like an idiot for hours after I finished it . Sure the ending leaves some things open , but it offers endless possibilities for future books . Not in a way that leaves your teeth on edge , cursing the fact that you 've got x number of months to wait until you find out what happens next . But rather the ending leaves you both satisfied and anticipating where the overall adventure could be going . <p> It 's just like a season of the television series used to make me feel .

Youll smile , you 'll gasp , and you might even find yourself tearing up a bit . <p> The timing of the Alpha Quadrant story line and the Gamma Quadrant story line do n't  always run concurrently as you read each novel of Mission Gamma . But they end at the same point . Through it all the characters continue to be become more richly detailed personalities , exhibiting growth in both large and small ways . And we get to be introduced to some fascinating new characters , some of whom well love to hate . Its a very large cast and some characters get more emphasis than others at times , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been reading books for almost forty years , and to me the true measure of a really great story is that I cant wait to read it again . From beginning to end , Mission Gamma is that kind of story . Make no mistake , there may be four novels , but there is only one story . And that is what makes Mission Gamma so extraordinary . What was begun in Twilight and continued through This Gray Spirit , Cathedral and Lesser Evil is , from beginning to end , one magnificent story .

Meanwhile , Janeway retires for the evening , only to find her quarters transformed into a love nest and Q waiting to inform her that he 's chosen her to be the mother of his child . <p> While the crew snickers and Chakotay sulks , Q attempts to woo an uninterested , suspicious captain with bathtub serenades , a puppy , promises of getting home ... the usual , for an omnipotent being with not much imagination when it comes to women . Finally , pursued by his long-time lady love among the Q , he is forced to tell Janeway the truth : he wants to have a child with her to try to put an end to a devastating civil war among the Q which is causing the supernovas . He picked her not only because he finds her attractive , but because her decision to let Q ( the one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continuum so he feels it 's her duty .

The captain came off as strong and independent without losing her passion and warmth ; this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " perhaps even " Resistance . " <p> The captain I fell in love with in " Caretaker " and " The Cloud " was deeply committed to her values and goals , but also to alleviating the suffering of others .

I like the fact that for once she was willing to admit she had weaknesses and failings without getting defensive about them , and that she clearly thinks connections between beings are of utmost importance . <p> " The Q and the Gray " was one of Chakotay 's better episodes too ... not because he looked particularly commanding , he rarely does , but because he too was passionate without being possessed . The scene in the ready room where he tells Janeway how much he resents Q 's propositioning her is the most blatant soul-baring we 've ever heard from him , and was quite touching . I liked her concern for his feelings as well . And the fact that Chakotay was n't baited by Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeway even when he 's upset . I wish this guy had stuck around for " Scorpion . " <p> This was even a good Q episode , though the fact that the Continuum has been demystified is a big disappointment - and a big waste for the franchise . Q was less superficially misogynistic than in " Death Wish , " and more sympathetic - for once he looked less like a bully than like a child overcompensating for his own limitations . If he 'd thought with his brain instead of , well , whatever the Q equivalent of the " wrong head " might be , he would have figured out that Janeway could have helped his people a lot more as a counselor than as the mother of the messiah . <p> But the flip side of the episode , the treatment of gender and domestic issues , is very much a product of the Star Trek universe , where there 's no such thing as a tolerable long-term relationship . Even the omnipotent beings fall into stereotypical human cliches . Sex is alternately an indulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting women to pop out heirs for the men who rule the universe . Even 400 years in the future , females are characterized as mothers , nursemaids , and contributors of DNA for powerful men , rather than as resourceful , intelligent , valuable people . <p> It bothers me greatly that the Q now have gender , in direct opposition to what Q himself said on The Next Generation - my favorite-ever Q moment was when he told Picard that if he 'd known Picard was vulnerable to love , Q would have appeared to him as a woman . I always enjoyed Q 's flirtatious behavior with Riker , as well as his attitude that carnal love was disgusting . Now , he 's just a standard boring heterosexual male . Suzie Q ( played by Suzie Plakson , so memorable as K'Ehleyr ) , was funny but deplorable , a sort of negative Janeway .

The relationship issues brought up by " The Q and the Grey " confirm my worst fears : deep down , Trek 's writers do think of committed love as something which represses free spirits , a " ball and chain , " as Q said . <p> And it 's always women being placed in the role of homebodies - and , therefore , restraints to liberty and liberation . No wonder Janeway takes the conservative position that love should be a prerequisite to mating ... like many women throughout human history who feared pregnancy and abandonment by more powerful men .
