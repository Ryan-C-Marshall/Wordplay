There were so many songs , from so many incredible ( and some not so incredible ) bands . While there are hundreds of extraordinary- songs from this decade , here 's our list of the 50 you should never forget . <h> 50 . All Mixed Up 311 <p> You did n't  live in the 90s if you have n't heard this song at least 1,000 times . <h> 49 . Been Caught Stealing Janes Addiction <p> Aside from giving us one of the weirdest- music videos of the decade , this song solidified Janes Addiction into the regular rotation- on radio stations across the country . <h> 48 . Good Riddance Green Day <p> You know you were having the time of your life at least once while listening to this song . Whether it was your high school graduation ballad or the song that inspired you to make a big decision in you life , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Killing in the Name Rage Against the Machine <p> F*$# You ! I wont do what you tell me ! <h> 46 . Sabotage Beastie Boys <p> Some will argue that the Beastie Boys were mainstream artists before this song hit the airwaves . While that may be true in some circles , the release of Sabotage made the Beastie Boys a household name . <h> 45 . Santa Monica Everclear <p> Sadly , - suicide was a big theme throughout a lot of 90s alternative music and culture ( see : Kurt Cobain ) . This song tells the story of one guys attempt . <h> 44 . More Human Than Human White Zombie <p> Alternative , meet metal . When White Zombie came into the scene there were a lot of plaid-wearing grunge rockers who popped this single into their walkman . <h> 43 . Basket Case Green Day <p> When Green Day released Dookie , nobody knew what to make of it . Song after song this guy named Billie Joe Armstrong was unloading every feeling he ever had on anyone who would listen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , up-beat manner like no one else had ever done . " Do you have the time to listen to me whine ? " Yeah , we all did . <h> 42 . Hy Hero Foo Fighters <p> From the ashes of Nirvana came Dave Grohls Foo Fighters , and much to everyones surprise Grohl was n't playing the drums . His musical talent transcended what we knew of him from his earlier 90s work . My Hero was often mistaken as a tribute to Kurt Cobain , but was actually just a song about everyday heroes who try to make a difference in the world . <h> 41 . Brain Stew/Jaded Green Day <p> Classic 2-for-1 and a preview of things to come from Green Day ( see : American Idiot ) this song came at you fast and hard and you could n't help it when you hit rewind ( remember rewind ? ? ) to listen to this track again . Note : These songs were originally released as a one song single which is why were calling them one song here . <h> 40 . Inside Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you either loved this song publicly or loved it in private . If you did n't  love it you were lying to yourself and everyone around you . Swallow your pride and admit this song is great ! <h> 39 . Scar Tissue Red Hot Chili Peppers <p> Anthony Kiedis had no problem telling people over , and over , and over that he had a drug problem at one point in his life . <h> 38 . Self Esteem The Offspring <p> If you 're a 90s kid , you know you relate to this song . How many of us had girlfriends we just *couldnt* get rid of ? <h> 37 . Hurt Nine Inch Nails <p> Anyone who can write a song and get Johnny Cash to cover it deserves to be on this list . Both versions included here for your listening pleasure . <h> 36 . Lump Presidents of the United States <p> This song is just weird , but everyone who grew up in the 90s knows it . Just like Lump , you cant get this song out of your head . <h> 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone love this song so much ? Probably because it took queues from the metal you listened to in the 80s and snuck them passed you in the form of a pop song . <h> 34 . Zombie The Cranberries <p> Who can sing like that ? <h> 33 . Buddy Holly Weezer <p> Even thought the band apparently thought this song was too cheesy to include on their first album , they did and you loved it ! <h> 32 . Hunger Strike Temple of the Dog <p> Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell got together and blew everyones brains completely out of their heads . <h> 31 . I Alone Live <p> When you saw Live live , you got to see one of the best vocalists to come out of the 90s alternative scene . This song was one of the two or three that hooked you and got you to buy that concert ticket . <h> 30 . Sober Tool <h> 29 . Glycerine Bush <p> Do n't  let another day go by before you listen to this song again . Kind of takes you right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  it ? <h> 28 . Hey Man , Nice Shot Filter <p> This song is cool . And then its crazy once you find out what its about . <h> 27 . Vasoline Stone Temple Pilots <p> About as basic as it gets when it comes to music ( my high school drum teacher gave me this song to learn at my very first lesson ) , the chord progression is still haunting and Scott Weiland pulls you in with his lyrics and vocals. <h> 26 . Daughter Pearl Jam <p> Pearl Jam is going to be on this list a lot , and they probably deserve to be on this list many more times than they are . This probably was n't the first song your heard from Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam , but it quickly became one of your favorites , despite the message of the song being quite disturbing . <h> 25 . Lightning Crashes Live <p> This song taught you that someone else had a way worse day than you did . <h> 24 . Jeremy Pearl Jam <p> Clearly I remember the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life changing . Not to mention the first time you saw the music video . <h> 23 . What I Got Sublime <p> What 90s kid did n't  love Sublime ? In this song- Bradley Nowell taught us life is good and we need to take it easy come what may . <h> 22 . Yellow Ledbetter Pearl Jam <p> Nobody understands how this song could have possibly been left off of Pearl Jams first album . When people found it as a B side single , they went nuts . The song made the radio and made it all the way to 21 on the Billboard charts . <h> 21 . Bittersweet Symphony The Verve <p> Epic song about normal stuff . <h> 20 . Creep Stone Temple Pilots <p> Scott Weiland really does n't  like himself . <h> 19 . Heart-Shaped Box Nirvana <p> A subtle progression from Nevermind , this song- makes 90s kids wonder what Nirvana could have been if Kurt Cobain was still around . <h> 18 . Big Empty Stone Temple Pilots <p> Although this song is definitely not a traditional blues riff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the blues sound . <h> 17 . Everlong Foo Fighters <p> By the time you heard this song you were probably already convinced that Dave Grohl was a much bigger star than you thought . If not , this was the song that pushed you over the edge . <h> 16 . In Bloom Nirvana <p> The second song on this list ( and not the last ) from Nevermind , some would argue the best . Also the song that made you realize that Kurt Cobain did n't  care . <h> 15 . Loser Beck <p> You bought this single on cassette and listened to it over and over until the tape broke . So did everyone else . <h> 14 . Alive Pearl Jam <p> Aptly titled , this song gave birth to Pearl Jam when Eddie Vedder first sang vocals to an early instrumental track . Changed a lot of peoples lives forever . <h> 13. 1979 Smashing Pumpkins <p> You almost did n't  get to hear this song , but you know you 're glad you did . <h> 12 . Even Flow Pearl Jam <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the 60th or so recording of it ? You loved it the first time you heard it . <h> 11 . All Apologies Nirvana <p> Some people have said this song proves Kurt Cobain knew he was going to live a much shorter life than any of us wanted him to . <h> 10 . Better Man Pearl Jam <p> Another deep , haunting story told in a way only Eddie Vedder could . By the time we were done listening we all believed she deserved someone better . <h> 9 . Come As You Are Nirvana <p> The title alone gave validation to an entire generation of grunge rockers . The fact that the message was delivered in this song made it gospel . <h> 8 . Plush Stone Temple Pilots <p> Hard not to choose every song from this album , but this one easily cracks the top 10 . Our introduction to Scott Weiland and STP couldnt have been better . <h> 7 . Lithium Nirvana <p> This song gave Nirvana fans a glimpse into the type of music that inspired Kurt Cobain to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bridge Red Hot Chili Peppers <p> RHCP front man Anthony Kiedis bares his soul in this song , and some would say this song made RHCP. <h> 5 . Black Hole Sun Soundgarden <p> This is the song everyone knows Soundgarden from . Your dad even loved this song . <h> 4 . No Rain Blind Melon <p> Another great song written by another great singer who left us way too soon . <h> 3 . Black Pearl Jam <p> When it comes to Pearl Jam , or any 90s alternative music really , it does n't  get much better than this . Black became more legendary because of how protective Eddie Vedder was of this song . <h> 2 . Creep Radiohead <p> If you 're a Radiohead fan , this song is probably the reason you started listening to them . If you 're not , you still remember hearing this song . A lot . <h> 1 .

@@61449670 @1449670/ <h> X96 Beginners Guide To Emo Revival <h> Emo rock is back , but its not what you might think . <p> In its heyday , early to mid-2000s , emo rock was wildly popular with bands such as Taking Back Sunday , Brand New , My Chemical Romance , Dashboard Confessional , The Get Up Kids , Saves The Day , and Thirty Seconds To Mars who once filed the ranks of emo popularity during the time . However , during the late-2000s , emo rock declined in popularity due to music trends changing , as they often do , and that many of the emo pioneering bands were either moving away from their roots or breaking up altogether . Fall Out Boy broke up and then got back together and started writing more radio-friendly , stadium rock/pop music . Taking Back Sunday moved on from their over-aggressive shouting to a more mature style . Both Panic ! At The Disco and Thirty Seconds To Mars moved on to a more synth-pop , glam rock sound . Chris Carrabba of Dashboard has been working on his new folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly silent for the past few years . <p> It looked like the emo scene had ran its course , until recently there have been a few underground Warped Tour-esque bands that have been keeping the flame alive . This new batch of emo groups have been taking elements of the emo scene and recreating it to fit a more modern musical landscape . Since this reincarnation of emo is noticeably different from the bands of yester-emo , the term " emo revival " was coined to describe this new sound . Emo revival keeps a lot of the aesthetics and feeling of the old emo-pop the overtly confessional lyrics , over dramatic expressions and metaphors , and a overall melancholy/somewhat introspective attitude . The instrumentals have been toned down in order to keep more of a focus on the lyrics and emotional tone of the songs . <p> Let us take a look into what bands this new trend has to offer : <h> American Football " Never Meant " <p> Technically , this band started in 1997 and ended back in 2000 . So chances are that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did briefly get back together last year and released an deluxe version of their self-titled album . American Football has set the standard and helped spark this new emo movement . Their style , specifically in this song , will be heard and reflected throughout the rest of this playlist . So its only fitting that they should be included on here . <h> Pianos Become The Teeth " Repine " <p> Dark , melancholy , introspective , Pianos Become The Teeth have it all down . Their latest album , Keep You , is the perfect album for you to listen to during a rain storm or while driving home late at night . <h> Balance And Composure " Reflection " <p> Balance And Composure fall on the heavier side of the emo revival spectrum . The soaring guitars and relentless drumming are very reminiscent of Circa Survive while the lyrics are much more emotionally heavy . <h> Foxing " Night Channels " <p> Foxings new album , Dealer , is like a sucker punch straight to the feels . Do n't  let the goofy video still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like she has heart of stone . <h> Tigers Jaw " Hum " <p> Emo revival meets folk rock in Tigers Jaws " Hum . " Brianna Collins melodic vocals do well over the light folk guitar strumming . Tigers Jaw offers a more multi-layered style to the genre . You can either tune out the lyrics and simply nod your head and tap your foot to the simple beat or delve deeper into the lyrics and get an emotionally deep indie rock tune . <h> Moose Blood " Cherry " <p> Think of early Clarity-era Jimmy Eat World having a jam session with So Long , Astoria-era The Ataris . That should give you a good idea of the scope of Moose Bloods sound . " Cherry " falls more on the softer side of their sound while the rest of their album offers more of a early emo-pop vibe . <h> La Dispute " Woman ( In Mirror ) " <p> https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=5BLiQxT61QQ <p> Soft instrumentals that focus more on rhythm and beat give the listener more of a chance to focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convey . That 's the goal with La Dispute , in particular their new album Rooms of the House . The vocals in the album range from mostly spoken word to screaming to some light singing while focused on telling the overarching story of the album . <h> The Front Bottoms " Twin Size Mattress " <p> Similar to acts such as The Early November and Dashboard Confessional , The Front Bottoms have powerfully confessing lyrics written over a soft acoustic laden with other light instrumentals . <h> Touche Amore " To Write Content " <p> Touche Amore also sit on the heavier side of the emo spectrum . Harsh guitars accompanied with screams that are just as harsh , both lashing out to grab the listeners attention . <h> The World Is A Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid To Die " Heartbeat In The Brain " <p> Yeah , their music is just as intense and exhausting as their band name . More concentration is put on the instrumentals rather than the vocals in this track . The mixture of clean vocals and light screaming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emo bands ( Taking Back Sunday , Brand New , Hawthorne Heights , etc . ) . But these guys implement in a more toned down , melancholy way . <h> Empire ! Empire ! ( I Was A Lonely Estate ) " How To Make Love Stay " <p> Another long-winded band with a sound that is equally exhausting on the emotions . " How To Make Love Stay " sounds like it could belong on Brand News The Devil And God Are Raging Inside of Me . Its very similar to tracks like " You Wont Know " and " Untitled . " This band focuses more on the downer guitars and - drums fills , breathing more emotion into the instruments than the lyrics . <h> Follow our Spotify playlist below and have yourself a good cry . 189944 @qwx599944 189945 @qwx599945

Ferris Buller said , " Only the meek get pinched . The bold survive . " Before music was made for the masses , people had to rebel in more physical ways . The French did n't  take kindly to recommendations on cake eating . The American revolutionaries did n't  savor " taxation without representation .

And Eddie went , Whaaaat , you bought a GUN ? And I said , In fact , I bought two , which ended up as the opening line of the song . I think its fair to say Eddie was pretty outraged . " <h> 13 .

@@61450264 @1450264/ <h> No Dancing in Saint George <p> People are all a buzz about the recent story out of St. George where a local dance was shut down by the cops . - It made NATIONAL news ! - I 'm pretty sure Keven Bacon has tweeted about it by now ! But believe it or not , this story actually DOES surprise me. - Before.Before I was X96s- Mid-Day superstar , I was a morning show host in St. George . - I was a well known cat ! - For ten years I did the " Jon Smith Show " , I was given the key to the city TWICE , they even declared a " Jon Smith Day " in the city ! ( Only because I asked them to , but shhh ) . <p> Usually this sort of thing is reserved for realtors . <p> But even with local fame and fortune , I would not dare shake my booty in Washington County . - At least not within city limits , unless I had a permit . - Footloose jokes aside , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people on the city council , who can be real a**holes when it comes to gettin jiggy with it , will often go out of their way to shut dances down . - In this case , a guy by the name of Jared Keddington was holding a party at a place called Fiesta Fun . - Which is a well known place in the STG because well .. Its a small city and there 's not a lot to do there if you 're not into riding bikes or being an old coot. - So a heap of college kids bought tickets to a private party , at a private business . - Only to have the fuzz show up and forbid them from dancing . - Think about that for a moment . - There were no drugs . - No booze . - just kids riding go carts and busting an assorted move . <p> Put your hands in the AYAAAAAAA ! <p> In cities across the nation we are dealing with riots , corruption , and you know , actual crime . - Yet , here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were fighting in the movie .. - Swing Kids . - ( Ha ! - You thought I was going to make another Footloose crack ) . - So why is this a big deal ? - There HAS to be more to this story . <p> In the past few years , Ive seen Mackelmore , Voodoo Glow Skulls , Aquabats , and Reel Big Fish roll through town . - All had dancing involved . - When Yo-Gabba Gabba hit the stage at The Electric Theater on St. Georges historic Main Street . - Nobody seemed to care when 600 7 year old kids when ape sh*t on the dance floor . - But at the same time , Ive seen concert venues open where kids were forced to " hop in place " instead of dancing , and a night club shut their doors and leave town only weeks after getting their coveted permits . - I 've been through the permit process , its not that hard . - Theres even a box you can check for " Dance " . - I do n't  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to send a gift . <p> According- to my pal , - stgeorgenews.coms Mori Kessler , who actually broke this story , the city has- maintained that the promoter did n't  follow procedure and apply in time and it bit him in the end . - Which honestly seems like a fair statement . ( thanks to Stgeorgenews.com for the photo of Fiesta Fun ) <p> All of these facts combined could only mean one thing <p> The world will jump at any opportunity to talk about Kevin Bacon movies - And I 'm more than ok with that . <p> Mmmm . - That 's the stuff . 189944 @qwx599944 189945 @qwx599945 
@@61450265 @1450265/ <h> 24 One-Hit Wonders from the 90s That Should Never Be Forgotten <p> When you think of a one hit wonder , often times you think of that amazing song that you were listening to that one time with that one person . More often than not you remember the music , melody , and lyrics but you do n't  remember the band/group/singer who performed/rapped/sang it . Some one hit wonders are so obscure you 're not sure you even remember if you ever knew who the hit belonged to . Others belong to bands/groups/singers who your memory tells you had several , if not dozens of hits . <p> Regardless , one hit wonders always tug at our heart strings . They take us on a nostalgic journey back to a time when life was simpler . They take us back to Junior Prom . To high school graduation . To the first time you kissed someone . These songs , whether we loved them or not , help us hold special memories from different times in our lives . In this case , the memories from the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to set the rules . To qualify as a one hit wonder here you have to fit under the following criteria : <p> The song has to have been released as a single in the 90s . <p> The song has to have made the top 40 on the - Billboard Hot- 100 list . <p> No other song by this artist can have the same criteria ( single in the 90s , top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 list ) . <h> 24. - Onyx " Slam " <p> Nothing said " get off your couch and move " like Slam . When this track spun at your junior high school dance all the boys went nuts . " Let the boys be boys " became theme for a lot of 90s pre-dudes. <h> 23. - Wreckx-n-Effect " Rump Shaker " <p> Yeah , you remember this song . The second you hit play you know you 're about to teleport back to the time when all you wanted to do was see someone shake their rump even if you did n't  know why . <h> 22 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Chances are you 've heard this song about 42,673 times . And you know all the words . And every time you hear it you ca n't help but " WHOOMP ! " <h> 21 . Urban Dance Squad " Deeper Shade of Soul " <p> This song is weird , but it made you want to go outside in the sun , ride your skateboard , and just chill . " Mellow . That 's my style . " <h> 20 . Lou Bega " Mambo No. 5 " <p> Do n't  pretend you did n't  sing along to this song . You know you wanted a little bit of Monica in your life <h> 19 . Cypress Hill " Insane in the Brain " <h> 18 . Paperboy " Ditty " <p> This is just a great song . Paperboy really knew how to lay it down . Hit play Youll remember . <h> 17 . Skee-Lo " I Wish " <p> Every dude wished he- were a little bit taller . And that he- was a baller . And had a girl who looked good so he- could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not sure about the rabbit and a hat with a bat though . <h> 16 . House of Pain " Jump Around " <p> Actual 9th grade conversation : Me " Who are these guys ? " My friend : " Some dudes from Ireland . " Me : " Ireland ? ! " My friend : " Yeah . We should move there . We could totally be rap stars . " Me : " Um ok . " In case you were wondering , we did n't  move there and House of Pain are NOT from Ireland . <h> 15 . Silverchair " Tomorrow " <p> Everyone was calling Silverchair the next best band ever when " Tomorrow " hit the airwaves . Bet you ca n't name another song of theirs <h> 14 . Chris Gaines ( Garth Brooks ) " Lost In You " <p> Ok , I know country fans out there are calling for my head right now . How dare I say Garth Brooks is a one hit wonder . Well , we all know he is n't . His alter ego Chris Gaines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13. - DNA " Toms Diner " <p> This song always made you think someone was peeking through your window at you . Still does even when your window is on the 3rd floor of a building downtown . <h> 12 . Biz Markie " Just a Friend " <p> These days most people remember Biz Markie because he was a recent contestant on Celebrity Fit Club . But way back in 1990 Biz hit us with " Just a Friend " and stayed in our heads for years to come . <h> 11 . Green Jelly " Three Little Pigs " <p> Originally called Green Jello ( until a copyright lawsuit popped up ) , heavy metal band Green Jelly got HUGE for a minute when they re-told the story of the three little pigs in a very angry way . I remember a lot of people telling me this band was from Utah because they named themselves after the States favorite dessert . FYI , they 're not from Utah . <h> 10 . Tom Cochrane " Life Is A Highway " <p> Some people reading this are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nope . Tom Cochrane originally made this song a hit . And never had another one . Both versions here for your listening pleasure ( or pain ) . <h> 9 . Right Said Fred " I 'm Too Sexy " <p> Even though you probably hated this song , you still listened to it 1,426 times . <h> 8 . The Mighty Mighty Bosstones " The Impression That I Get " <p> SKA ! From the band who legitimized Ska for a generation , had a cameo in " Clueless " , and made you realize a Boston tough guy could make some really happy music . Probably surprises some people that the Bosstones only had one hit . Wont surprise them that this song was the hit . <h> 7 . The Proclaimers " I 'm Gon na Be ( 500 Miles ) " <p> You heard this song so much you would walk 500 miles if you never had to hear it again or any of the 56,887 cover versions of it . Except the MxPx one . That one is still cool . <h> 6 . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you , Sir Mix-a-Lot was n't the first guy to make , um , plus sized rear ends a priority . Freddy Mercury did it first with " Fat Bottomed Girls " . If you 're still reading this article , however , you liked em because this rapper from Seattle told you to . <h> 5 . Blind - Melon " No Rain " <p> Some will argue that this would not have been Blind Melons only hit if singer Shannon Hoon did n't  overdose on cocaine . Unfortunately he did , and this is all we got . <h> 4 . Steelheart " I 'll Never Let You Go " <p> You probably played this song for more than one girl hoping it would get you to second base . It probably worked . <h> 3 . Beck " Loser " <p> Hard to believe this guy had only one " hit " . Not hard to believe it was this song . <h> 2 . The Offspring " Come Out and Play " <p> Another surprise until you remember that these guys released a ton of popular stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Maybe the biggest surprise of all . You know this band . You love this band . If Bradley Nowell had n't  died of a heroin overdose right before this song and album dropped , I have no doubt they would n't be represented on this list . Sadly , they are . 189944 @qwx599944 189945 @qwx599945
