It is just the nature of any project work and something that simply needs to be taken in stride . <p> A challenge we encounter quite often when first working with new clients is defining , at a fairly granular level , a project 's scope . Often organisations know what they want in terms of high-level project deliverables , but have not gotten down to the nitty gritty stuff - but that 's what we 're here for ! <p> Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals , deliverables , features , functions , tasks , deadlines , and ultimately costs . <p> In other words , it is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to deliver a project . <p> It is important to pin down the scope early in a project 's life cycle as it can greatly impact the schedule or cost ( or both ) of the project down the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key processes to follow in order to define scope correctly . <h> Define the Product Requirements <p> Before we determine what will be in the project 's scope , you must be very clear about what are the product requirements , otherwise known as product scope . In other words , what are the functions and features required for the website , application and/or software solution being developed ? Is there anything specifically that must be built into the design ? Must it follow a specific set of branding guidelines ? The list goes on . <h> Define the Process Requirements <p> Process requirements describe how people interact with a product and how a product interacts with other ( often existing ) business processes . When you discuss how data gets moved and how business transactions flow from one point to another , you are describing process requirements . For example , the requirements for billing transactions within a website , how such transactions link to invoicing and accounts , and at what point can staff view and alter the status of orders needs to be detailed . <h> Involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for a project to be delivered successfully , the correct stakeholders from the organisation commissioning the project must be involved very intimately at various stages of the project scope . When this does not occur , assumptions begin to be made ( which are generally subjective ) and stakeholder confusion can occur as the project goes on . <h> Identify the limitations <p> Perhaps even more important than what is in-scope for a project is what is out-of-scope for a project . Often it is crucial to document what will not be done " otherwise people will assume that certain things are to be executed that were not budgeted for or included in the project timeline . <h> Change Management <p> It is natural for parts of any large project to change along the way . While it is always best to avoid scope creep ( a situation in which one or more parts of a project ends up requiring more work ) , sometimes it is unavoidable due to the changing nature of any business . In order to avoid disagreements and changes to a project 's scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best to have strict change management processes in place . Once scope is defined , it must not be changed without the appropriate change management functions taking place , at which point appropriate action can be taken to address the shifting project requirements . <p> So there you have it ! A simple guide to getting your project off to the right start by correctly defining your project scope . At its very basis , effective scope management requires good communication to ensure that everyone understands the requirements of the project and agrees upon exactly how the project 's goals will be met . Once you have this bedded down , you have the foundation to commence and hopefully successfully complete your project .

@@121446513 @10446513/ <p> Successfully navigating a business through a rebrand is undoubtedly a monumental challenge . Contrary to what many people will say , the rebranding process is not about cosmetic changes or a series of design deliverables ( although they are major elements ) . It is about defining and articulating your story and message ; it is updating a business 's goals , message and culture ; it is change that should ideally have a profound , positive shift in your business 's identity . <p> We are going through this very rebranding process at Totally as we speak " so I thought it would be beneficial to share much of what are working through . <h> Why conduct a rebrand ? <p> If your business is operating in the same way today as it did 5 years ago , or even less in some industries , then you are stagnant . And that is never good . <p> There are several good reasons for a business to rebrand themselves " new products/services , new audiences , a merger , an acquisition , an outdated company or , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , there are also times when not to perform a rebrand . For example , if your company has significant brand equity , you could end up losing customers if the process is n't executed well . <p> So as I said , a rebrand is a tough move to pull off . But that 's not to say it ca n't be done , and done well . <h> Which path should I take ? <p> As a general rule , there are three paths you can follows when conducting a re-brand : 1 ) Work with internal teams to manage the process ; 2 ) outsource the rebrand process entirely to an external agency ; 3 ) a combination of both . <p> Each process most definitely has its merits and there are numerous examples of each being executed to perfection " which option is best for you may largely be dependent on the qualifications of your team internally and your available resources . <h> Action Plan <p> Once you have determined a rebrand may be beneficial , put down on paper what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it and when you want it done by . <p> Appoint someone to lead to way and act as brand steward , driving the entire process from conception , to implementation to enforcement of guidelines . So often companies have intentions of rebranding , but external forces ( i.e. customers ) take priority . <p> Putting down on paper the who , what , when , where and why ( oh , and do n't forget how ) , along with someone to drive the whole process , will ensure all your good intentions have the best chance of actually coming to fruition . <h> Prepare for change <p> Rebranding your entire business requires a shift in thinking , often letting go of old processes and routines . This extends beyond those coordinating the rebrand , but to the whole organisation . Everyone needs to be on the same page and communicating the same message " from the way staff answer the phone , to how they engage with clients/customers , to the tone of email correspondence . <p> Being prepared for this change is important and requires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grunt-work . Open internal communications and a positive perception throughout the organisation about the rebranding process is a must ; usually , people simply want to know what 's going on . <h> Launch with your big-boy ' voice <p> The is no point in going through the above process if you are then going to casually implement all your hard work and continue to go about your business as per usual . Talk about a missed opportunity ! <p> Use the launch to celebrate past accomplishments and outline the company 's vision for the future . The brand launch is also an opportunity to reconnect with past clients , as well as the media and prospective clients . This is the time to remind the marketplace who you are , what you stand for , and what you can deliver for them . <h> Deliver on your promise <p> Have you ever met someone who is all huff-and-puff , but they ca n't blow out a candle ? <p> Ok , I do n't mean in the literal sense " but the point is that all the bravado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't deliver on them . Your organisation must deliver on the messages communicated , or risk alienating customers because what you say you can do , and what you can actually deliver , are very different things . <p> Change is very important " whether it is a complete overhaul or a few adjustments , every organisation of every size can stand a bit of improvement . <p> We will be sure to keep you updated on the Totally Communications re-brand over the coming months , with a planned roll-out later this year .

@@121446542 @10446542/ <p> In this post I 'm going to talk about how the decision of which CMS you use can affect the development of your website or application . What affect does it have on the developer , and what are the long term implications for the site owner . Does it take longer to build something from scratch ? Is it always better to do so ? What are the hidden costs of apparently cheaper one-size-fits-all solutions ? <p> I will - hopefully - wrap up those questions with some insightful answers , and end with some kind of meaningful conclusion. - <h> When is it right to go bespoke ? <p> If you 're talking about clothing , the answer 's simple , every time you can afford to.In software design the decision is n't always so clear . Also , how does this decision affect those of us on the project coalface ? The answer to that question really depends on the project itself . <p> Sometimes , although rarely , the requirement is for a simple brochure style website with a few pages advertising an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than display a few words and some pictures . In that instance a program like Perch , which enables simple lightweight editing capabilities for small sites , really shines . Creating an online presence like that should be a cinch for any developer , and a pleasure to maintain for the site owner . <p> Perhaps you 're a celebrity , or a brand , and you want to share your news in a more conversational style than the traditional press release allows . If that 's your only requirement , then one of the many excellent blogging platforms would do the job perfectly . Wordpress- stands out for me as an example of something easy to install and configure , which is robust and well supported . We have developed Wordpress sites for our clients , and when you stick with the intended functionality of the software , it 's a simple pain-free process . Working with a Wordpress site after development is also pretty easy , and quick to learn , with many great themes available if you get bored with the way it looks . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth mentioning is Ghost. - It 's a Kickstarter funded project which Jason touched on last week in his Review of the week- with a back-to-basics ethos people seem very receptive to . It 's interesting to note that a lot of new projects are in fact stripping away functionality and bloat in favour of finely tuned niche features . <p> Maybe your business sells a product and you want to move into the world of eCommerce . In that case you might decide to use ZenCart , - Magento , - or even Drupal . Each of these software solutions have been around a long time and are used by millions of other people , so they must be doing something right , right ? In my experience that 's not always the whole story . <p> - - - - In the case of Drupal , for example , you are using software originally written to perform the function of a bulletin board- which is now being used by literally thousands of websites as an eCommerce platform . Over time this lightweight BB platform has grown , organically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfil various other tasks . Today , Drupal can perform the role of almost any type of site . The tradeoff being that it does n't do any of them brilliantly without significant investment to further specialise it to your requirements . Also , it 's now so bloated with unnecessary functionality that it 's very resource hungry . A Drupal site will often require its own server to run effectively where other systems can sit side-by-side in shared environments , running 20 or more concurrent sites . That said , no other CMS system tries ( and succeeds to some extend ) in doing so much , for free , straight out of the box . <p> Magento on the other hand is also free , written specifically for selling stuff on the web , and has a large developer community . I have personally developed a couple of Magento sites and I would say that it 's a very capable piece of software . Some of the code genuinely represents a benchmark study in object-oriented software design. - Many large brands use Magento ( generally not the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might therefore assume that developing a Magento site is nice and easy , and the obvious choice for open-source , free eCommerce software . In practice it 's actually quite complicated to use , with a steep learning curve for both the developer and site owner when it comes to maintenance . The documentation lacks depth and the aforementioned excellent object-orientation means that reading the intended workflow from code in isolation is time consuming , and often a bit of a head scratcher . The amount of work required to extend the core functionality of the software - even a little - is disproportionate to the task . With experience our developers have learnt to make it jump through hoops but that journey caused more than a few late nights , and would be a daunting prospect to unspecialised people . <p> A major player in the eCommerce world seems to have picked up on this problem . Amazon recently launched a new free ( sort of ) service called Webstore- that boasts rich , modern features , simple set-up , and seamless integration with the Amazon marketplace . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from DIY , or IIY ( install-it-yourself ) platforms , - to hosted , configurable products . <h> So , if these packages all do their job , however well that might be , why go for something bespoke ? <p> The answer is simple and almost unavoidable . At some point , you are very likely to require the software to do something it does n't do by default . If you decided to use a pre-existing CMS or software package , then you are going to have to change the system to meet your needs . At that stage you are investing in bespoke software , whichever way you look at it . It 's true that a lot of these platforms have modules , plugins or extensions that will do what you want . The support for these often expensive mini-apps ranges from amazing to non-existent . Also , quite regularly , there is no existing plugin that does exactly what you want - so you either change your business to suit what is available , or , again , invest in a bespoke solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I care . What difference does it make to me ? <p> I am often asked to step in and work with a business that has outgrown the functionality of their existing online software , but they do n't want to change it significantly . Or a client might ask for a particular platform to be used , generally because the skills required to maintain the software already exist within the organisation , so no further training is required . The ability to hit the ground running- with a new project definitely has its advantages . These are all very reasonable situations backed by solid business reasons . <p> They do however give me a good perspective on the alternative , which is starting with or moving to , a business specific , bespoke solution that meets the current needs precisely and can grow with the organisation . <p> I think any developer would agree they love a challenge , and the chance to be exposed to varied software . Therefore , refactoring existing systems or developing new functionality can be interesting and rewarding . Coercing square pegs into round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's role - which is great for the developer , but perhaps less desirable for the person forced to engage their services because their critical business systems no longer fit the bill . <p> I often wonder if the attractive , seemingly cheaper route , is a bit of a red herring given the extra development time required to sculpt these packages into their final shape . Also , in terms of time costs I suspect it 's not as clear cut as you might first think . <p> Nothing these days is truly written from scratch ; not music , literature or software . We all re-use our own code , written using frameworks which themselves build upon other systems , re-using widgets made available by service providers . As such , entirely new systems are not quite as bespoke as you might think , and that 's a good thing . Developers - good ones at least - re-use or refactor code they know works well as a time saving device , not untested dubious code from unknown sources . Therefore a lot of the basic functionality can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create and test the brand new parts of the system for any given project . So , possibly less to worry about that you thought when it comes to the build time of a bespoke system . <h> Moving forward , - what should you take away from this post ? <p> If nothing else , it 's a good idea to give a word limit to humanities graduates writing blog posts . Other than that , it 's probably just a cautionary note to consider the hidden future cost of choosing these pre-existing systems . If you 're investing time and money to launch your product you want to make sure your choice of software is a good one . You want to be confident there is a buoyant community of developers so you can get help with any future issues. - If the job is likely to change beyond the scope of the tool , do n't use it . Pick a package and team that can grow with you . Consider bespoke software if it 's appropriate , or use a package that is truly flexible while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you decide you do need to leverage a proven , existing system , at Totally we generally advocate a different type of CMS - - and perhaps unsurprisingly , it 's something we developed ourselves .

But unlike the alternatives , it 's actively developed by the same team that will be creating your site or application . It is an enterprise class hosted system that requires no setup by the end user . It combines the extensibility of all the other systems described here with the added benefit that it can be integrated into other bespoke applications , rather than having to be modified itself . It is written to an excellent code standards which means it 's easily maintainable by other developers , should you want to take your site elsewhere . We 're all very proud of it and genuinely feel that it represents the middle ground between a completely bespoke system ( which we also love creating ) and one of the jack of all trades- platforms that exist .

Next I open up the online platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cloud-based customer service platform which includes ticketing and customer support features . I will then have a multitude of projects and support tickets which I have to juggle between - my first objective is to focus on what project to prioritise and the best way to approach this . I have to make sure that I 'm available to talk to our clients through Zendesk or over the phone about any problems they may be having or any new features they are requesting . <p> As a support developer I must ensure I 'm always monitoring the support queue along with the rest of my team , however while doing this I 'll be working on my own individual projects ; for example I am currently building a website for one of our clients the Commercial Bar Association . As well as this I 'm working on microsites for some of our existing clients . Besides my intense work schedule I 'm currently involved in a fierce table tennis competition with my colleague , Joao , so that is definitely a big part of my day - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a career in web development ? <p> I started programming when I was around 11 , mainly creating online games which as you probably know is n't the way most 11 year old boys spend their free time , but for some reason I really took an interest in it and it became my favourite hobby as a young child , obviously I never lost interest in it as I then decided to pursue it as a career . After graduating from university I knew all I wanted was to be at the forefront of new web technologies . <p> What would you say are the main skills one needs to become a support developer ? <p> Well there are probably too many skills to list , however a few that come to mind would firstly be communication skills because all the work we 're doing is evidently for our clients and therefore we must ensure we 're meeting every need they have , be this over the phone , in person or just simply via email . I also think one would need to be able to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additionally it 's important to find the right balance between learning and teaching . I 've been here for six months and I 'm still learning new things each day , even from those who may have less experience ; likewise they will often look to me for advice , which I am more than happy to give . <p> Finally , I ca n't promise it will be like this at every digital agency but here you have to know how to handle your alcohol in any social situation ; a key skill that I wish someone had taught me before committing to this position . But who does n't enjoy being the office lightweight , right ? <p> What would you say you most look forward to about coming to work ? <p> This sounds very cliche but I 'd be lying if I did n't say that one of the things I look forward to is definitely seeing my colleagues , along with all the other fun parts of the office , such as : beer and Pizza Friday . On a more professional note I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with . As a developer every day is different , you work with different people , different projects and different clients so it 's actually a fairly satisfying feeling to encounter a variety of different activities each day and something I really look forward to . <p> What part of your job do you find most challenging ? <p> As I said earlier it 's not always easy to just choose one thing as every day brings new challenges , but on a general note it is always difficult to alternate between support tickets and other projects . I 'm finding the more experience I get , the easier it becomes . However sometimes it can feel like there is n't enough hours in the day to do it all ! I 've always been pretty good at managing my time accordingly so it 's definitely something I 'm working on and feel like I 'm getting better at . <p> Is there a project you 've worked on and are particularly proud of , if so what is it and why ? <p> Yes , my current project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I 've really wanted to work on for a while and it 's great because it 's really challenging which obviously means I 'm increasing my skills in that particular area of the job . I 'm also enjoying it as I 'm working directly with the designers ; I 'm getting feedback from them and my supervisor which is very beneficial to me . <p> If a new person was to join the support team what advice would you give them ? <p> First and foremost I 'd say to be yourself . My second piece of advice would be to listen 80% of the time and talk 20% ; you 'll find that the more you listen , the more you 'll learn . This office in particular is full of very knowledgable people , so I say speak up if you do n't understand something , add input when and where you can and of course spend as much time as you can learning from the people around you . On a more personal note I 'd definitely say interact with your colleagues as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the right balance between work and fun . <p> Like the sound of being part of the support team at Totally ? We 've actually got roles going , so- apply now

However , they will be allowed and encouraged to collaborate with their classmates on joint projects and experiments . <p> ' Blended Learning Labs ' are beginning to pop up in educational establishments across the world , and so far the results are proving to be very promising . By actively mixing online digital lessons with in-person attendance , students are able to work to their individual levels without the risk of falling behind the rest of the class , or becoming bored because the work is not being issued quickly enough . <p> This method of learning is more commonplace in the USA , where programmes have been developed to cover everything from archaeology to science and web design .

There will always be room for more students , so there will be no competition for places for popular subjects , and the school will not need to employ more teaching staff to run multiple lessons . <p> For older students , there would also be the opportunity to enrol for classes without actually having to attend the class in person .

All children will be equipped to thrive and learn with no-one feeling as if they are being ignored or left behind . <p> Having the chance to deliver tailor made digital lessons is a great way to help prepare children for their future that will involve them working closely with technology .

How have your first two months been with us ? You can be honest , we do n't mind <p> ( Laughs ) Haha , they 've actually been really great - I feel really comfortable with all the members of staff . The job is interesting and challenging because my background is quite different . Although it keeps me on on my toes - as I said everyone in the office is very nice , so I am really enjoying it . <p> ... good answer ! That 's what we like to hear and we 're obviously pleased that you 've settled in . So you mentioned that you 've some from a slightly different role to the one that you 're doing now ; tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what you do now <p> So I was assistant director of an art gallery and I guess it was different because I was mainly used to managing myself . But it was very busy so I had loads to like looking after things like calendar management and events - and I think that 's the part that fits with the position I have now . The reason why why I decided to apply to the job advertised was because it seemed a very creative environment . The guys obviously work very hard and at the end of the day you have a product which you prepare - the process is a bit like the process of creating a piece of art . <p> Well we must admit we 're certainly a creative bunch ( *humblebrag* ) . Could you tell us a bit more about about your art ? <p> So I create a lot of abstract art . It 's always very difficult for an artist to speak about their art - but I love colours , and I love textures and I concentrate mainly on creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm working really hard on my art at the moment and I am hoping to get through the Royal Academy Summer exhibition next year . I went through the first stage this year - but I did n't quite make it through to the end . But I am really trying to make it through this year . <p> Wow that 's pretty impressive . Can we see some of your work ? <p> - So other than your artwork , what other things do you like to do in your spare time ? <p> I like walking a lot - in parks , by the canal . I like going out with friends ; I am often proposing things to do . I enjoy going out and meeting people . <p> Organising and planning ! Sounds like you 'll do just fine here . So this is kind of a sneaky question , but how is the organisation of the Christmas party coming along ? Obviously without spoiling it too much for everyone , what sort of thing can we look forward to ? <p> So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dates we have chosen and I am just really waiting for them to get back to me with a final confirmation . I will probably involve drinks , food and maybe some dancing . <p> You 're really not going to reveal any details are you ? Drat ! OK , well we 've got a couple of quick-fire questions which we 'd like you to answer as instantly as you can . <p> Thanks Sara for taking time out your busy schedule - we 're delighted to have you join the team at Totally and are really looking forward to continue working with you ! <p> If you 're like Sara and are keen to work in a friendly , creative team which has wicked Christmas nights out , pizza Fridays every other week , a fridge stocked with drinks and choccies - and you 're not averse to hard work - then we invite you to look at the roles we have available at the company at the moment ( *cough* UX designers take note ) .

Each company has their own unique processes and procedures and working for one such company is no preparation for working for another . <p> I think you also need to wholeheartedly adopt the idea of continual learning . Technology is developing rapidly and it is important to embrace this change and devote every effort to keeping up. - <p> Do you have a favourite part of your job ? <p> I 'm not sure getting Totally to shout us pizza every other Friday counts as part of my job technically , but it 's certainly a favourite part of working here .

Those days can be challenging , particularly when you have a tight deadline .

I still remember the first one and the feeling when it went live - that is definitely up there . <p> But I suppose bringing some semblance of order to the United Synagogue Intranet is worthy of mention as it 's a massive system , and a big job .

The work will be different from what they have done before , although there will be similarities too . But it 's marrying the two that is key to learning how we do things and how you can progress here . <p> After that , we generally find there is no limit to what a developer can achieve for themselves , and offer us as an employee .

@@121446604 @10446604/ <p> There are three key processes in delivering search results : crawling , indexing and ranking . <p> There is little doubt that SEO is taking longer to deliver results than ever before ( assuming you comply with Google 's guidelines as we do at Totally ) . <p> At the same time however , the value of being top of organic search has never been greater , which is why the SEO/Search industry has grown at such a rapid rate in recent years . <p> As more and more websites are created and compete for attention , search engines have had to keep up with this growth while still focusing on delivering the most relevant content for a user . As a result , it is important to have a firm grounding in how search works in order to ensure your site is as search engine friendly as possible . <p> At a basic level , there are- three key processes in delivering search results- I am going to cover today ; crawling , indexing and ranking . <h> Crawling <p> Crawling is the process by which search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sites or pages , changes to existing sites , and dead links . <p> To do this , a search engine uses a program that can be referred to as a ' crawler ' , bot ' or spider ' ( each search engine has its own type ) which follows- an algorithmic process to determine which sites to crawl and how often . <p> As a search engine 's crawler moves through your site it will also detect and record any links it finds on these pages and add them to a list that will be crawled later . This is how new content is discovered . <h> Indexing <p> Once a search engine processes each of the pages it crawls , it compiles a massive index of all the words it sees and their location on each page . It is essentially a database of billions of web pages . <p> This extracted content is then stored , with the information then organised and interpreted by the search engine 's algorithm to measure its importance compared to similar pages . <p> Servers based all around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorting this information requires significant space and both Microsoft and Google have over a million servers each. - <h> Ranking <p> As SEO 's this is the area we are most concerned with and the part that allows us to show clients tangible progress . <p> Once a keyword is entered into a search box , search engines will check for pages within their index that are a closest match ; a score will be assigned to these pages based on an algorithm consisting of hundreds of different ranking signals . <p> These pages ( or images &amp; videos ) will then be displayed to the user in order of score . <p> So in order for your site to rank well in search results pages , it 's important to make sure search engines can crawl and index your site correctly - otherwise they will be unable to appropriately rank your website 's content in search results . <p> To help give you even more of a basic introduction to this process , here is a useful video from Google which explains it quite well . Each search engine follows a similar methodology to this. -

@@121446610 @10446610/ <p> For many companies , search engine traffic is their lifeblood . They sink or swim on what new leads and enquiries come from customers finding them through search engines such as Google . <p> For charities , the direct benefits of promotion through search engines are less obvious and as a result , SEO sometimes becomes neglected communication tactic . <p> But the positives for charities and not-for-profits that can come from SEO is endless . <p> Just imagine growing your traffic for particular key words , for example ' Clean Water Africa ' , from 50 to 500 or even 5000 visits a month - and that 's just for that one keyword search term ! <p> Its not just about numbers though . People searching for ' Why does n't Africa have clean water ? ' are obviously interested in that cause . So if your organisation is dedicated to providing clean water to those in Africa , they 'll probably be interested in what you have to say . <p> Its not just about numbers though . People searching for ' Why does n't Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . So if your organisation is dedicated to providing clean water to those in Africa , they 'll probably be interested in what you have to say . <p> SEO is about picking the right keywords - finding opportunities to tap into , like the extreme poverty example above , that will bring the right kind of visitors to your site . <p> So while larger charities such as UNICEF or World Vision who have broad name recognition can perhaps get away with ignoring SEO , smaller charities do n't have such a luxury . They need to focus on raising funds or generating attention to their services at a much more grass-roots level . <p> Below are 5 reasons why every charity or non-profit organisation should engage in SEO. <h> 1 . Increase Awareness <p> A charity or NFP 's website is their window to the world " a chance to capture attention , show what your charity/NFP does , engage and involve supporters and raise funds . SEO will drive traffic to a website more than any other tactic , giving more people the chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raise more money <p> A key strategic goal of all but a few charities is to raise funds in support of their service delivery . A study conducted by Blackbaud earlier this year found that online giving grew 10.7% in 2012 compared to 2011 . SEO can drive visitors either directly or indirectly to your online donation page . <h> 3 . Finding new supporters <p> If the majority of your search traffic is branded , it shows the people finding your site through search engines already know about you " meaning chances are they 're your existing supporters . That 's great , but what about all those other more general searches for issues relevant to your cause ? These search terms generally have a higher volume than your brand name , with a lot of them made by people unfamiliar with your organisation . These people could be potential new volunteers , donors or fundraisers. <h> 4 . Reputation , credibility &amp; trust <p> Ultimately , SEO can increase trust and loyalty in a charity . If searching for the name of your charity or even related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ( if not the first ) of a search engine , it immediately undermines your reputation , not to mention you 're missing out on quick wins and pre-qualified visitors who are already engaged enough to search for you by name . <h> 5 . Promotion of a specific campaign <p> Campaigns are a tried and tested strategy for charities to build support and promote specific causes . With search engines becoming increasingly reactive , incorporating more topical issues , news and events and integrating social media too , the incorporation of creative and interesting optimised content on your website can increase the reach and impact of your campaigns , not to mention generate interest from other websites and even media .

@@121446612 @10446612/ <p> Let be honest here , most people do n't go on first dates because they 're fun . Sometimes they 're ok , often they 're awkward , and on many occasions you will never see them again - or at least that 's always been my impression . <p> Unfortunately , unless you want to die alone in your apartment under a mountain of cats , at some point you have to get in the game . <p> The first date is when you get to know someone . It 's when you get to observe them as person and determine whether you 'd be a good match - or rather , if they 'd be a good match . <p> While it may sound odd , people are judging your website in the very same manner , asking themselves a very similar set of questions . <h> First Impressions <p> Turns out , first impressions do matter . Who knew ? Everything from someone 's looks , dress sense , intelligence , timeliness and personality come under the microscope when going on a first date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of a website when landing on a homepage or landing page , on average making a decision on whether or not to engage in a deeper level of interaction within 5 seconds . So you need to make sure your first impression counts , and fast ! <p> Granted , most dates allow slightly longer than 5 seconds to make the right first impression ; but it can all be over in those opening seconds as well . <h> Are you on the same page ? <p> After assessing whether or not your date is within the bounds of your normal tolerance level of crazy , next you begin to evaluate whether you 're both on the same page . Essentially , the date turns into a reconnaissance mission ! Broadly speaking this may include not-so-subtle mining for shared interests , passions , opinions , foods , or even if they share your secret passion for collecting ornamental owls ( unlikely , but possible ) . <p> Assuming a user has been wowed enough by their initial impressions of your website to navigate further , they similarly next assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The key point here is that organisations need to ensure what the user wants and searched for is clearly addressed on the homepage or landing page . It should lay the groundwork and guide a user in a certain manner that not only reflects the type of experience your company wants its audience to have , but the type of experience your audience desires and seeks . <p> Otherwise , once again . next ! <h> Creating trust <p> While you ca n't create trust on one date , you most definitely can lose it . Your date declaring their passion for automatic assault rifles or rocking up to dinner in their Hells Angels ' colours is probably not going to create the immediate urge to open a joint bank account . <p> Again , it 's not much different here on the web . Your landing page should be the first step in creating trust in your organisation . Do you have the experience and skills in whatever it is you claim to do ? Is it safe to use a credit card ? Will you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with creating this trust , as discussed in another recent blog post . <h> Is it hard work ? Annoying ? <p> Even if your date ticks off all of the above with flying colours , it still does n't necessarily guarantee a successful courtship . They might be a perfectly nice person with whom you have a few things in common - but then there 's the little things . For example , do they chew with their mouth open ? Do they ramble at times ( or , all of the time ) ? Do they only talk about themselves ? Are they easily distracted by shiny objects ? Any of these quirks or annoyances may be deal-breakers and result in a second date not being all that forthcoming . <p> The same can be said of a user 's experience with your website . Users will look at a site and assess how difficult it 's going to be to navigate and find what they 're looking for . Are they going to have a hard time finding the right product or service ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? Are things laid out sensibly ? If your site looks like it 's going to be high maintenance , or even annoying to use , customers are going to go and find a site that is n't hard work . <h> So what now ? <p> The end of a first date is always a little awkward . You 've managed to last the entire evening without a faux family tragedy conveniently intervening , so what 's next ? Are you going for a coffee after dinner ? Maybe catch a movie ? Do they want your phone number ? Are you supposed to make the next move ? Are they ? What 's that , they 're flat is within walking distance ... how convenient ! The point is , most dates that end successfully have some sort of plan of what is supposed to happen next . I 'm meant to do X , they 're going to do Y. <p> Once I 'm on your landing page and you 've passed all of my selection criteria - a great first impression , you offer everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user experience ( all of which may assessed subconsciously ) - I want a road map outlining what I am supposed to do next . At a basic level , some sort of call to action that lays the groundwork of what is meant to happen to get the ball rolling . <p> Of course , dating is the analogy here . The point is first dates and homepages/landing pages are really just a door to bigger and better things . But just because your date is great on paper , it does n't mean their marriage material . Similarly , just because you have a website does n't mean you are going to convert potential customers into something far more valuable . <p> You 've got to work for it , tick all the boxes and hope you get lucky ( pardon the pun ) .

@@121446618 @10446618/ <p> Choosing a CMS can be a daunting task . They really do come in a wide variety of flavours ; from commercial tools with all the bell and whistles , to open-source tools with a vibrant community of dedicated developers , to home-grown CMS systems developed inhouse . <p> And because there are pros and cons with any of these tools , the system you choose should reflect your agency 's goals , objectives and needs . Without a clearly defined set of requirements , you risk being tempted by elaborate functionality you will never use . <p> What then should you look for in a CMS ? <p> Below is a list of key considerations you should take into account when selecting a CMS . <h> 1 . Core Functionality <p> Many people assume all CMS platforms perform the same functions - for example , creating , deleting , editing and organizing pages and content . While at a very basic level this is true , there is a range of functionality that not every system supports , such as eCommerce , events management , multilingual support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on ! <p> On the other hand , there is no point investing in a CMS with bloated functionality you will never use . Unused functionality is n't excess power , its excess weight slowing you down and making your system unnecessarily cumbersome . <p> Making a definitive list of what you need and do n't need from your content management system , as well as any future requirements , is extremely important and the first thing that will help narrow down the field of competitors . <h> 2 . Interface &amp; Usability <p> The whole point of a CMS is to enable non-technical people to make updates and changes to the content of your website easily . So it 's important the backend of whatever CMS you choose is intuitive and easy to use . Badly designed systems can frustrate users with poor accessibility and usability . And even though the majority of people are familiar with word processing and spreadsheets , they may not be all that technically savvy . <p> When navigating around the administrative portion of a CMS you should be able to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to create content should also be a consideration . An intuitive system that makes a user 's life easier can cumulatively add up to a considerable amount of time saving . <p> Updating and maintaining your website should n't be a constant struggle ! <h> 3 . Initial Set-up &amp; Deployment <p> Where costs can be incurred when implementing a CMS is in setup . <p> While open source CMSs may be available free of licensing costs , and can mean a saving on up-front expenses , the system still needs to run somewhere , and be installed and configured to your needs . <p> If you happen to have provision for hosting already , as well as the technical skills available , then you may be able to do this yourself . <p> However this is n't a step to be underestimated , with configuring and optimising CMSs for production use often a complicated task . The safest route in many cases is utilising a dedicated vendor to take care of this for you . <h> 4 . Flexible <p> The presentation of content or the functionality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations may have existed in the past in terms of the way content is retrieved and presented , the best CMS 's now largely avoid these constraints . <p> Without naming names , we have had ( and still do at times ) the misfortune of working with quite a few well known content management systems that are completely inflexible in their presentation of content . Such systems continue to put unreasonable constraints on the design and can have serious impacts on accessibility . <h> 5 . Extensible <p> Most CMSs will allow for a certain degree of configuration to bend and shape them to your particular needs ( some better than others ) . But once you go beyond relatively common functionality , then , over time , the CMS will most probably need extending in some manner . <p> The ability of the CMS to incorporate extra features into a website or application by means of bespoke development or plug-ins , such as photo galleries , media players , event booking systems etc is an important consideration . And much like the flexibility of a CMS regarding design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their superior code base . <h> 6 . Integration <p> Some businesses have unique processes that require multiple systems to operate their business ( e-commerce websites , procurement systems , CRM systems , Volunteer Management Systems etc ) . But when such systems do not integrate effectively , the resulting dispersed data can significantly hinder the businesses ability to collect , compile , share , analyse and report on important information in a timely manner . <p> The ability of your CMS to integrate with existing systems or third-party applications is an extremely important consideration . <h> 7 . Search <p> Search is one of the most important aspects of any website , however it is an often overlooked element when selecting a CMS . Here are a few things to look for when assessing a CMS 's search engine friendliness . <p> Title Tag Customization <p> Static , Keyword-Rich URL Customization <p> Meta Tag Customization <p> Enabling Custom HTML Tags <p> Internal Anchor Text Flexibility <p> 301-Redirect Functionality <p> Image-Handling &amp; Alt Tags <h> 8 . Budget &amp; Licensing <p> When choosing a CMS you 'll need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford . You can either opt for a commercial proprietary CMS offering a robust set of features and ongoing support , or follow the free open-source CMS route . <p> Choosing one over the other really boils down to your business , your needs , your budget and often the preference of your staff or the developer building the website . <p> Today , many organisations are going down the open-source route as it is viewed as a substantial cost saving while still allowing a great deal of freedom to customise . <p> Nevertheless , no matter what CMS you opt for , it 's always best to investigate the costs in terms of licensing fees and ongoing development - otherwise a cheap solution in terms of initial outlay may blowout very quickly . <h> 9 . Support <p> For open source projects , the level of community support is very important ( unless you have in-house technical support ) . Such large active communities help to further develop the CMS as well as providing answers to any questions users may have . However , you should remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , there is no real support line ' that can be contacted asking why your site is down . <p> Paid professional support is an option that should be pursued in most cases , particularly with larger sites . This does n't necessarily mean you have to choose a proprietary CMS as many companies ( including Totally ) generate revenue from open source software by offering a comprehensive paid support service . <p> For commercial proprietary CMS solutions , support if often built into the licensing arrangement , however it is important to understand the extent of this support and what limitations are placed on the licensing arrangement ( as there will be some ) . <h> 10 . Future &amp; Scalability <p> It is important to select a CMS that will work for you not just right now , but in the future as well . A CMS should have the ability to scale with your organisation as you grow and change over time . After spending all this time researching the CMS that is perfect for your organisation , you do n't really want to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting your ability to expand your web presence . <h> Conclusion <p> The main conclusion from all of this is that choosing a CMS is far from an easy decision and requires a great deal of thought , planning and future consideration . <p> Whether open source or propritary , you should evaluate each CMS purely on its own merits . Does it do what you need ? Does it fit within your budget ? Can it be properly and satisfactorily supported ? Can it grow and adapt as your organisation grows and adapts ? <p> Finding a CMS that closely aligns with your needs is the best way of getting value for money !

If you were to navigate to this URL you 'd be presented with the page below that is optimised for payday loans : <p> They are clearly displaying one set of content to Google while redirecting users to another page . <p> Leveraging Expired Domains <p> Often domains that have existing authority expire and become available to purchase . As these sites already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engines spammers are able to leverage this authority get them to rank for desired keywords rather than grow a sites authority from scratch . Expired domains are readily available to purchase at sites such as expireddomains.net and domcop.com <p> If you visit http : **29;297;TOOLONG you can see that this expired domain is being prepared to try and target the payday loan SERPs by leveraging the existing authority the site has . The meta title clearly indicates the site will eventually be flipped to Kitty Payday Loans ' ( see below ) . <p> Hacked Sites/ Hacked Content <p> Hackers are often able to gain access to a site through security vulnerabilities . Once gaining access to a website they are often able to add content to existing pages . Such pages are often meant to manipulate search engines and sometimes the added content is hidden from users and webmasters through cloaking <p> They can often be distinguished by content that is completely irrelevant from the domain name . For example In July last year http : //www.parliament.uk/- was ranking 7th- for payday loans ; it had clearly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it rank for this keyword . At some later date the hacker would then look redirect this page . <p> Leveraging Google+ Accounts <p> Spammers have been using fake Google Plus accounts to help build trust in Google 's eyes by manipulating Google Authorship . This allows them to get a picture of a person next to their search result which in turn helps make the website more legitimate . Not only that but it also increases the number of people who click through to that search result . <p> Only a couple of months ago leanbenchmark.co.uk linked their website to a Google+ account by the name of Winifred Beane ' . This is how it appeared in the search results : <p> If you clicked through to the Google+ profile it was clearly affiliated with leanbenchmark.co.uk : <p> The spammers have subsequently moved on and leanbenchmark.co.uk now redirects to electric-media.co.uk which displays content for Kitty Payday Loans. - <p> Outlined here are just a few of the tactics spammers are employing to game the search engines . These are often used in combination for maximum deception and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although these spam tactics are easy to spot with the naked eye it is much harder to identify and exclude them algorithmically ; while Google 's algorithm is so dependent on links spammers will always be able to leverage new and expired domains in combination with Google bombing- to game the search - results . Based on the fact it took only one week for spam to reappear in the payday loans SERPs I would speculate it will be some time before these tactics become obselete.

Consumers wo n't warm to you . Your business wo n't grow . Your time and money will be wasted . So fix it ! <p> Harsh ? Maybe .

Unfortunately , many site owners often struggle to grasp this concept , instead creating a site experience users love ' by focusing on the things they ( as site owners ) actually care about . <p> In essence , they build their website backwards . <p> So , in order to create a site experience users love , take the time to identify their needs , wants , desires and points of annoyance - you know , the things they actually care about . Because it 's impossible to create a site your users will love if you do n't know them . <h> Keep it simple <p> So many websites focus on the fancy bells and whistles of web design before establishing a solid foundation for the messaging and the conversions they 're looking to build . <p> Unless you 're Facebook or Reddit , users do n't navigate to your website because they 're on a leisurely Sunday stroll through the green pastures of the internet . They come with purpose , or perhaps more accurately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , they 're looking for a low-interest loan , their iPhone died and they're- looking to upgrade . <p> As a site owner , you need to determine what your customers ' needs and wants are , and provide them with the most relevant solutions and information they need to solve them . That 's it ! Simple , right ? <p> If they want to go on an expedition searching the depths of your website for gold , great - their already invested . But for those who are merely prospecting , give users exactly what they want and nothing more . <h> Feed your audience <p> To win your audience 's favour and keep them coming back to your site , you need to offer them an incentive . A little something for their efforts . <p> Now this does n't necessarily have to come in cake or chocolate format ( although that would probably work ) .

@@121446642 @10446642/ <p> When it comes to design , there always tends to be a question of whether to be trendy or to be a trendsetter . To stay current and relevant to the latest visual styles or to create innovative designs that will inspire others . <p> Whether designers choose to embrace current trends or steer clear of them , one thing can not be argued " they impact the web tremendously . <p> In 2013 , simple layouts that display optimally across platforms were all the rage . That trend will likely continue in 2014 , but what more can we expect ? <p> Below are a few trends we feel will be a positive influence on web design in 2014 ! <h> 1 . Less is more <p> Minimalism is set to continue taking over the web world . Designs , colour schemes and graphics that are minimalist in nature are quickly becoming the order of the day . Nobody wants to navigate through pages and pages of text and overcrowded graphics . <p> A cleaner page is easier to navigate , understand and scan , with organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor is there in the first place . <h> 2 . Simple Colour Schemes <p> The use of simplified colour schemes began to creep into vogue in 2013 and will only become more popular in 2014 . In particular , expect to see websites with monochromatic colours - all the colours ( tints , tones and shades ) of a single hue with the addition of white , black and greys - popping up all over the web in the coming year . <h> 3 . Flat Design <p> Ok , so this has been popular for much of 2013 , particularly since iOS7 came out , but it 's still going strong . Flat designs rarely introduce dimensionality , shadows , or textures into the equation , relying instead visual clarity and unique , often bright , bold colour combinations to communicate . <h> 4 . Mobile-first <p> As touched on above , now responsive web design is becoming more commonplace , we are starting to see brands dig deeper into our mobile lifestyles . There is evidence this will go one step further in 2014 , with organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which then becomes the foundation of the entire layout of their desktop website . Large user-interface elements that are intuitive and easy to navigate are a sure sign symptom of such an approach as they combat shrinking screen sizes and help users effectively tap their way through information . <h> 5 . Animated Storytelling <p> All good designers try to communicate some sort of message or story with their designs . But this is poised to go to the next level in 2014 , with designers ( and developers ) using a combination of animated words , illustrations , scroll activated animations , typography , videos , photographs , colour , icons and symbols to tell their story through a level of interactivity like never before . <h> 6 . Moving/Video Backgrounds <p> As just touched on , websites do n't have to be static and many brands took advantage of this in 2013 . With organisations set to try to communicate more with less in 2014 , browser-size background videos are set to become even more popular , providing audiences with an inside look into your company , product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 7 . Long-scrolling <p> Trends suggest long-scrolling website are in - and they 're here to stay in 2014 - with users now more comfortable than ever with scrolling through the web to find information . And now with animated story telling also set to become more widespread , along with mobile display a primary consideration , single page sites will become even more prevalent .

But my i 'll feelings towards my cat Harry were soon expunged by the prospect of Brighton SEO . A place where likeminded people gather to talk tips , make jokes about the need for great content ' , aggressively head hunt others , and of course drink ! <p> 4 Drinks In <p> We 're on the train to Brighton and I 'm eyeing up the Drambuie on the food cart when it hits me that we 're surrounded by other excited SEOs , eagerly discussing the latest industry buzz . I imagine any muggle on board would be deeply confused about the controversial gang war between the white hats and black hats . Not quite as gory as bloods vs crips but equally as played out . <p> 5 Drinks In <p> Still on the train I managed to trade my bottle of water for some whiskey off a man I nicknamed waste bredder ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I picked out the following plan : <p> 6 Drinks In + 2 Free Drink Vouchers <p> Entering the venue I spotted an old acquaintance from my hustling days giving out name cards and free drink vouchers . 6 Fingered Filo was his name , and I 'd helped old Filo get off a murder charge a few years back in South East Asia , meaning it was easy to get an extra drink voucher ( passed to me with a sweaty hand and sleazy wink ) . <p> The first thing I noticed about the setup of Brighton SEO was that the main hall was n't setup for any talks in the mid-section like last time . In fact I never actually found where they were being held . That 's the only problem with the Dome theatre ; it has more sections than a mental institute . But they still hold the technical talks in the smallest room ! <p> 7 Drinks In <p> We hit the first talk of the day by Ian Miller . Ian 's talk was a good reminder that ultimately , Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technologies . I asked Ian if he thought Google would move into the VR space , seeing as they 're everywhere else : <p> If someone does n't make a VR bar and program it so people see rainbows instead of sick when blowing chunks , I 'll be disappointed in mankind . <p> On a more sober note , Ian 's talk made me think of the extra $200 million reported in the yearly revenue Google makes from having a slightly different shade of blue in their ads . With the recent drop in authorship snippets and the live testing of different colour star ratings , it 's important to remember that changes in the SERPs can have a signifcant impact on Google 's revenue from advertising . <p> - <p> 8 Drinks In <p> Unfortunately I missed Jon Earnshaw 's talk on cannibalisation , which we 've seen an increasing amount of in the last year due to Google 's move towards semantic search . Instead I waited in line for the next set of tech talks after the break , as I knew from last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinks In <p> Tom Bennet 's talk was arguably the best this year at Brighton SEO . That 's not because it was around this time that I was hitting a state of drunken euphoria , but Tom 's short demonstration of how you analyse log files was incredibly well-articulated and useful . <p> In short , collecting and analysing data on how Google Bot visits your site allows you to understand which sections of your site are not being crawled . This could be due to a loop caused by poor website architecture , a technical issue related to redirects , or just poor internal linking . Having all this data at hand will allow you to make improvements to make Google crawl the most important sections of your site . <p> Tom if I ever see you at the pub I 'll buy you a drink or five ( but only if I have a company card on me ) . <p> Discussed the purpose of disavowing links in order to be proactive , especially important considering the impending Penguin update and the issue with sites effected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White " Hacking Google docs to detect and diagnose penalties <p> Displayed a great way to display data about each client through Google docs for easy daily data digestion : <p> Great insight into the large variety of data sites out there , such as Fishbase , Eagle-I , and Geo Name .

However before I fade to the peaceful black I can safely say that there were some very interesting and useful talks at this year 's Brighton SEO . The speakers I saw gave us insight into how we can inspect our data more effectively , whilst giving us that broader vision by Google which impacts our everyday tasks . If the paramedics can pump my stomach well enough , I 'll most certainly be back next year . 
@@121446653 @10446653/ <p> When initially meeting with clients about SEO , one of the first things we flag with them is that it truly is a long game . So many of the basic principles of SEO , such as building engaging , unique content that other sites link too , can take months to achieve . Of course , when the penny drops , all the effort can be more than worth it . <p> Despite this , there are range of short-term quick wins that everyone can do . Below are 7 of the most common SEO quick wins that when resolved can impact your website 's performance in search engines rather quickly . <h> 1 . Page Titles <p> Page titles are still one of the most important ranking factors . Each page should have a unique title and if possible focus on one keyword area ( often the page 's H1 ) <h> 2 . Meta Descriptions <p> Even though Meta Descriptions have no direct impact on ranking , it is used in search results to describe your link and can have a big impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 150 characters ( including spaces ) or risk your text being truncated in search results . <h> 3 . Images <p> One of the most commonly forgotten on-page SEO quick wins is the optimisation of images , ensuring they all have ALT tags . The most important function of an ALT tag is to explain to a visually impaired user what an image is displaying . But ALT tags also ensure- search engines can crawl and understand images being displayed . <h> 4 . Effective Internal Links <p> Internal linking is crucial if you want your site to be indexed thoroughly by search engines . The actual text you use for that internal link is also important , with keywords and keyword phrases related to the page you are linking too recommended as the anchor text used ( i.e. not Click Here ) . <h> 5 . Direct Links to Important Pages <p> A flat website architecture is ideal for SEO , but this is not always possible . Instead , identify your most important pages and have direct links to them from your homepage . This effectively flattens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , thus helping them to rank higher in search results . Using the Anchor Text Key Stage 4 Maths to page about that topic would also be beneficial . <h> 6 . Keyword Research <p> Identify the range of keywords your potential site visitors might type in to search for your organisation , product or service . Then , work these keywords into useful content . This will help search engines recognise you website has content relevant to those search terms , and thus may be of interest to the user . <h> 7 . Google Analytics <p> Lastly , Google Analytics is a free web tracking service offered by Google to help website owners track and analyse traffic sources , website visitors , conversions , site performance and much , much , much more . If you are not onboard already , you should be ! It is very simple to implement and will allow you to better understand the behaviours of your visitors and what they want
