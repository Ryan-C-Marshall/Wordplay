@@37517426 @6517426/ <h> Twin Torment for Timmy <p> If I had known then what was to happen , I 'd have rushed out of the store door , but in hindsight it was now locked and I 'd have got nowhere fast had I decided to make a run for it . So all I could do was follow Miss Fotheringale into a change room and progressively get fitted with a control brief , padded panties and a lacy pink training bra after I had stripped down to my underpants .. My humiliation went from bad to worse , but all I could keep thinking of was the five pounds that I would get for putting up with all this . One other point of salvation was that the shop was closed , so there was only mum , me and Miss Fotheringale along with the junior saleslady who had let me in . If there had been other ladies coming into and out of the store that would have seen me , I think I would have died of embarrassment . <p> Mum had Tina 's measurements recorded and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and padded panties , both she and Miss Fotheringale let out more sounds of excitement as they measured me up and found I was getting closer and closer to Tina 's ' vital statistics ' . <p> However , although my chest was a 32B just like Tina 's , courtesy of a bit of help from some booster pads inserted under my training bra and my hips were now 34 's just like hers thanks to the padded panties , I had a problem with my waist which still was n't as slim as hers . What to do ? The ladies thought for a while and then decided the only thing was for me to wear an old-fashioned high-waist girdle , in order to get that final three inches from my waist . <p> I was soon to find out just how tight one of those girdles can be . Although Miss Fotheringale 's salon was basically there to stock frocks and accessories , she also had a small corsetry and hosiery department . She went searching into the corsetry area and soon came back with a heavyweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hooks and eyes plus a long zipper than had to be fastened . ' Timmy , You 're lucky that I 've got just one of these in a small size , because usually they 're for larger sized , more mature ladies who 've put on a bit of weight and need some firm control . ' <p> All the time the ladies were fixing the girdle onto me , I was told to keep breathing in . There were all those small hooks and eyes that had to be connected before it could finally be zipped up via that long zipper on the left side I then found I could hardly breathe out again because it was so tight . I soon realised this was one really mean and uncomfortable item of feminine underwear ! Miss Fotheringale measured my waist and finally she and mum were happy as the tape measure now read the magic figure of 24 inches . So , I at last had exactly the same measurements for my chest , waist and hips as my twin sister Tina ! <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually met Tina 's measurements , it was time to try on the dark red party frock that mum admired so much . It was really a very pretty garment , and if I had n't been in so much discomfort from that tight girdle I might have secretly enjoyed the experience of wearing it more than I did . It actually was n't that difficult to get into , just stepping into it and having Mum fasten it up at the back . <p> Thanks to all the various female undergarments I was now wearing , everything fitted perfectly . The last thing was to put on some lacy white petticoats to get the correct effect on the frock 's hemline . My ' chest ' jutted out in front , my now narrow waist fitted the confines of the frock , and my hips widened out just right for the cut of the frock . Mum and Miss Fotheringale ' oohed ' and ' aahed ' about how perfect I looked ! <p> Of course , it would n't have been all over without me having to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frock fitted me . That was when the two of them decided I really needed to wear some nylons and a pair of heeled shoes , because that was what Tina would need for the party , and also they were worried that the girdle would begin to ride up around my hips if I did not wear nylons with it . <p> Unfortunately the nylons proved to a bit of a problem because my feet and legs were apparently an unusual size combination , and the only ones that were the right size were 15 denier Kayser brand ' fully fashioned ' ones in dark tan . I think I could have managed to put on a pair of seam-free stockings on my own , but it proved beyond me to get those seamed stockings on correctly . It did n't help either that the girdle I was wearing was so tight and firm , making it difficult to lean over to put the nylons on over my feet . <p> So Mum came to my rescue , and slid one stocking on over each of my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lacy petticoats while Mum pulled the stockings up my legs and Miss Fotheringale made sure the back seams were perfectly straight before they attached the suspenders to the tops of the stockings . The girdle had three suspenders for each leg , so there were six of them to do up in all . Without Mum I do n't think I could have managed to get them with the seams even remotely straight , and I wondered just how mature ladies in similar tight girdles got on with putting their nylons on every day . <p> I guess that it was all a matter of experience , getting things just right . Now that I had the stockings on and the back seams passed inspection , it was a matter of finding a pair of black court shoes with low heels , seeing I was a novice at walking in ladies ' shoes . Miss Fotheringale rescued a pair with shiny steel bows on the front from a mannequin model which fitted me perfectly , but although the heels were barely two inches high , I had the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem was that because of the effect of the lacy petticoats pushing the hem of the frock outwards , I could n't actually see my feet so I was kind of ' walking blind ' in them . <p> One other problem was that they felt tight around the front , but the ladies told me that was the way women 's shoes were meant to fit when worn with nylons . If they were n't a tight fit , there was a good chance the shoe could fall off at some awkward moment and cause some disaster like laddering those expensive and delicate nylon stockings . <p> The salon had a small sort of ' catwalk ' which I had to walk up and down several times with both mum and Miss Fotheringale <p> watching my every move . It was really quite embarrassing , especially with the lacy petticoats continually rustling as I walked up and down . However , despite my problems with the shoes , they were both very happy with the way I looked in Tina 's party frock . Mum then told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss F. sorted out the finances in her office . I can not tell you just how happy I was to finally get to sit down ! CONTINUED

@@37517428 @6517428/ <p> I consider myself somewhat lucky . For whatever reason , I 've been enamored with the soft , silkiness of girls ' underthings , poufy slips and petticoats , and frilly party dresses from the time I was a young boy . Why was I lucky ? Because I had an accepting mother and a sister ( the only sister in a family of five children ) who would indulge me in my love of feminine clothing . Because I was the closest in age to my sister , my father kind of turned a blind eye to our dress-up activities . He must 've thought , " What 's the harm ? He 'll grow out of it . " He probably thought that I did ; however , that was n't the case . <p> We ( my sister , younger brothers and I , and even a girl and a boy cousin who were close to us in age ) would often play dress-up , then put on fashion shows for the adults whenever my aunt , uncle and their family came to visit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 60s , our families visited each other a couple of times a month , so it afforded us a lot of opportunities to engage in my favorite activity . ) I was a late bloomer -- I did n't reach my full size until I was a senior in high school . Until that time , my physique more closely resembled that of a young girl . The only thing that did n't give me pleasure in my cross-dressing was the bullying and taunting of my older brother . Larry was ashamed of me because he was big for his age and very athletic . He excelled in sports in both junior and senior high school . He wanted me to be just like him , and he had a hard time accepting the fact that I was n't . Mind you , I was good at sports and I liked them , it 's just that I did n't make the school teams because I was n't big enough . But , I digress . <p> My father worked two jobs and was n't around an awful lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry punched and kicked me more times than I can count , to try to toughen me up and to let me know that he did n't approve of my activities with Linda and Cindy ( my sister and girl cousin ) . I do n't doubt that some of Larry 's kidney punches and shots to my ribs contributed to my slow growth rate . Well , his punishment was n't too much of a secret -- most of our extended family knew about it . One summer , my aunt ( my mother 's sister , whom I love greatly ) came to my rescue . It was the summer of 1970 -- three months before I would turn 11 . All of the stars must 've been in alignment for the following scenario to unfold . I do n't know why or how it happened , but I 'm glad that it did . <p> My uncle , Richard , was a college professor , but he had taken a sabbatical to finish up the requirements for his doctorate degree . The school where he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our state just the year before ( after a 2-year separation ) , and the two kids in the family had wanted to go with their dad for the summer to spend time with a family that they had grown very close to in Oklahoma . My aunt could n't join the family because she had to take care of the upkeep on the home , ensure that their monthly bills were being paid , and be available for a niece on the other side of the family who was getting married . Because she did n't want to be alone all summer , and knowing that my sister was n't going to be available at the time she needed her , Aunt Meryl had asked if I would be willing to spend a couple of weeks with her , if for no other reason than to get me out of the situation with Larry for awhile . I readily agreed , not knowing that my cousins were n't going to be around or what she I and would be doing in those few weeks . <p> The afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go run around for awhile , Ally , but do n't get dirty , okay ? " ( I thought it odd that she referred to me using the feminine connotation of my name , but I did n't question her . ) When I asked where Cindy and Jon were , it was then that I found out that they were in Oklahoma and would n't be available at all during my stay . Again , she told me to go play at the neighbor 's but not to get dirty . ( She knew that I could n't not get dirty if I was playing with the next door neighbor boy , Brad Martin . ) I came in an hour and a half later with grass stains on my the knees of my jeans and it looked like I had been in a dust storm -- I was very filthy . <p> Meryl said , " Oh look at you ! !

" I did n't know it at the time , but the lotion was actually hair remover . She had seen Jon and I playing Batman and Robin a few months before , and noticed that we had raided some of Cindy 's tights to use with our costumes . Meryl had n't said anything , but she did n't like the way the hair on my legs poked out through the tights .

I was going to let you borrow some of Jon 's clothes , but they 're all too small . Cindy 's will have to do . " I found out later that it was part of the ploy all along -- to " forget " the clothes from the car and to get me dirty right off the bat so I 'd be " forced " to bathe . <p> I was dumbfounded more than anything , not upset at all , and somewhat excited . After all , as I said at first , I love frilly underwear and dresses . Aunt Meryl had seen me in various dresses and dance outfits from all of my earlier fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " leading the charge " and actually encouraging me into girls ' clothes .

Meryl added , " I know it 's only about 6:30 , but what if we just get into our jammies right now , enjoy some dessert , and watch some TV ' til bedtime ? " I told her that that would be great . She pointed to the nightgown on the bed , instructed me to put it and Cindy 's bathrobe on , then meet her downstairs . <p> Aunt Meryl was flipping through the TV Guide when I got down there , and she said , " Would you like milk or juice with your strawberry shortcake ? I answered , " Milk , please , " and she said , " There 's really nothing on TV tonight - what if we play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I indicated that that would be fine , not really self-conscious at all about the way I was dressed .

Jackie , my niece , really wanted Cindy to come with me , but she 's obviously not available - would you like to go with me ? " Before I answered her , I wanted to know if there were going to be any other boys there . When she said , " No , there wo n't . I was hoping that you 'd be willing to go in Cindy 's place , if we can find you a cute dress and some shoes ! " <p> For the second time in just a few minutes , I was so shocked I was speechless . Meryl felt awkward because of my silence and asked , " Will you please seriously consider it before telling me ' No ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't embarrass you , and no one will have to know that you 're a boy .

" I picked up on what she said and asked , " Dresses ? ! " She replied , " You 're going to be here for two weeks , Ally , and we ca n't have you going to both the tea and the reception in the same outfit , can we ? " I take it from your sly grin that you 're willing to do it ? ! " " Only if you do n't embarrass me and if no one finds out I 'm a boy . " I replied . Aunt Meryl just beamed at me and was almost as happy as if someone had just told her she had won $10,000 . Before preparing our strawberry shortcake , she added , " No one will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a deal " , I said . <p> We enjoyed our dessert , then Aunt Meryl got out her nail polish . She did her finger and toenails then asked , " Do you want to match me or should I find you a different color ? " I said , " Let 's match ! " and she complimented me on my choice . I had always been jealous of my mother and sister being able to wear nail polish ; now , here I was , openly wearing some at my aunt 's request . I was really enjoying getting dolled up without being hit or made fun of for doing so . <p> I had one of the best nights of sleep I ever have that night . We enjoyed a light breakfast the following morning , then Aunt Meryl found a pretty dress of Cindy 's for me which no longer fit her . The white tights felt great after she helped roll them up my hairless legs . They were followed by a crisp , white petticoat slip , a lavender party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to dig out an old Easter hat of Cindy 's to cover up my short hair though . After putting on some light blush and some soft , red lipstick , we were ready for our shopping spree ! <p> What an experience that was ! We were both dolled up ; walking hand in hand around town . We must have hit three different clothing stores and a couple of shoe stores and a wig store . I got some interesting looks and comments because most of the sales ladies knew I was n't a little girl . Most were fine with it because they wanted to make the sale , I guess . I was somewhat embarrassed , but it was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be . I trusted my aunt ! In all , I ended up getting three dresses ( complete with their own set of petticoats and slips ) , six pair of tights , two pair of shoes ( one in black and one in white leather ) and a sandy blonde wig . Aunt Meryl also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tops , six pair of panties ( in various colors ) , some girls ' jeans , and a pair of girls ' sneakers . <p> We had an enjoyable few days -- just aunt and niece hanging out together -- then had a great wedding tea for her other niece , Jackie , on Thursday . I saw and Meryl and Jackie exchange grins and winks after I was formally introduced as " Ally . " Jackie was old and wise enough to know that Meryl did n't have a niece named Ally . I appreciated her playing along though . All of the ladies and girls that were there at the tea could n't have been nicer . Most were none the wiser , but I learned later that I had n't been as passable and convincing as I thought . I guess some of the girls were wondering aloud to their mothers why I was n't sitting very ladylike at times . The high school-aged girls figured out that I was a boy , but they did n't make a scene and were actually very complimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said things such as , " You look very cute , Ally .

" <p> I did meet a girl a year older than I ( a girl named Natalie who was actually closer to Linda and Cindy 's age . ) She had the gall/courage to ask if I was really a boy . I went beet red , looked at my feet and eek-ed out a small " Yes . " Natalie 's mother got the biggest smile , and Natalie just said , " That is so coool ! Will you be at the reception tomorrow ? ! !

To the girls , it was just a game they played one rainy day , to me the start of a life long journey . <p> It was one of those typical English summers days we all remember from our school holidays - it could n't make up its mind to be sunny , cloudy or wet . So far it had been sunny at breakfast cloudy , then drizzle ; now it was cloudy looking like rain . <p> In the lounge of an average suburban semi-detached house was someone else who could n't make up his mind . Steven had been sitting in the front room of the house trying to read a book , but he was bored and restless .

After much thought and pacing backwards and forwards towards the door , he made a decision that unbeknown to him would have a profound impact on his life . <p> <p> " Oh , what are we going to do ?

Steven heard furniture being moved around and hoped they would n't move too much as Jack , who was 16 , would blame him if he thought the girls had been in their room . <p> Carol had delved into the wardrobe and found the box Margaret had mentioned which contained the veil , tiara , little white ankle socks with bows , a gold cross in a velvet box and white gloves . <p> " Do you remember Sister Mary Saviour saying we were all to be Brides of God ? " mused Margaret . <p> " Now girls , straight backs , heads up and small steps - we do n't  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation of the girls ' headmistress . <p> Carol put the box on the bed and both she and Steven turned to see Margaret pull her Communion dress out of its bag . It was typical of its kind in the 60s , a left over from the previous decade : a simple satin dress with lace overlay , tight bodice with peter pan collar and short puffed sleeves , the skirt flaring slightly designed to take an additional petticoat to give it real bounce . The net petticoat was taken down from its hanger . Steven stood there paralysed , like a mouse waiting for the snake to bite , his mind racing with a million thoughts at the same time , but his brain not able to process any . The only thought that came through his befuddled mind was what would it be like to wear that dress and those petticoats . It was this single thought that dominated and seemed to block out everything else in the room . <p> " Right , come on get those clothes off , " teased Carol helping Steven pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put the socks on , arranging the pretty bows on each side , then the petticoat , helping Steven step into it . The petticoat had a tight fitting nylon yoke from the waistband to the first layer of net and this fitted snugly around Stevens waist and over his cotton y-fronts . The dress was then dropped over his head and rustled as it spread out over the petticoat , the buttons were done up at the back of the bodice and the girls stepped back for a look . <p> " Isnt he a little sweetie ... back straight , head up , small steps , " she mimicked again . Steven was finding the net petticoats prickly against his skin . <p> " Hmm ... " said Margaret . " Looks ok for her Communion , but not exactly right for a bride . Stand still - stop fidgeting . Hmm ... I know what 's wrong with you - I had the same problem . Mother made me wear a half slip under the net petticoat which stopped most of the tickling accept on my knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in tights - that would be more grown up , " said Carol <p> " Yes , let 's , " agreed Margaret . <p> Steven said nothing , but just stood there , not knowing whether to pull the dress off , scream , or just run away . For some reason he did n't  understand , he felt almost imprisoned in the clothes and unable to do anything other than what he was told . <p> The girls took the clothes off , including the socks and got out a pair of Margarets best white tights . " Well , this is the ' something new ' . " Then she rummaged in her drawer to bring out her silky nylon half slip but , as she , did a pair of very frilly blue panties fell on the floor . <p> " Well that 's ' something blue ' , " laughed Carol . <p> Steven just stood there as the girls put the tights on him and smoothed them up his legs , telling him to pull them tight around his crotch ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic to snap as she settled them around his waist . Next was the very silky nylon half slip . As this last garment was pulled up around his waist Steven gave an involuntary gasp , as he had never experienced sensations like this . He could n't describe them - happiness , bewilderment , feeling emotional , almost as if he wanted to cry . The girls carried on in silence as if the dressing of Steven had taken on a life of its own . <p> Steven stepped into the petticoat and Carol pulled it up around his waist , there were now four layers of silky material encompassing his not yet ripe manhood . The dress was dropped over his head and the various layers adjusted , the dress was buttoned up behind him and he felt a slight tightness at the waist and neck , the sensation of imprisonment but such glorious imprisonment returned . <p> " Come on then on with the shoes " , Margarets voice broke Stevens reverie , Carol strapping his feet into a pair of his sisters white sandals . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed Stevens beat nick hairstyle forward and into a fringe , then attaching the veil to the tiara she fitted it into his hair then she dropped the front of the veil over his face . He was then given the gloves and he put these on himself . <p> " Oh dear , no bouquet ! " thought Carol out loud . <p> " What about the flowers in the hall ? Just put the stems into an old white sock to protect the dress , " suggested Margaret . Carol disappeared downstairs and came back with the flowers and , as suggested , wrapping the stems in an old white sock . <p> " Ok , let 's look at you - hold the flowers in front of you about waist high . " Carol pushed Stevens arms into position . Margaret had gone into the other room and Steven heard her tell Eileen and Jill that the Bride was now ready . " ' Fashionably ' late , " laughed Jill . <p> Carol explained that she was the Father of the Bride and Steven had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Margaret was the priest , Eileen the best man and Jill the groom ; this made Steven blush a deep red behind his veil . The humiliation of it all - wearing a pretty dress and being paraded in front of the girl of his dreams - just did n't  seem right . Before Steven could do or say anything Carol was hooking his arm around hers and he was clasping the bouquet tightly so as not to drop it . <p> " Straight back , head up small steps and off we go , " laughed Carol . <p> As they walked into the bedroom , Steven found that the tightness of the half-slip forced him to take very small steps . Steven could see the girls were wearing Jack 's and his blazers and shirts and ties over their shorts ( which just made Jill even cuter ) . They all hummed the wedding march as he came in , and Carol paused in front of Margaret and handed Steven over to Jill , who took hold of his hand . Margaret did a good job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love , Honour and Obey " part . Steven had relaxed and was just letting all the wonderful sensations wash over him when he heard his Sister say , " You may now kiss the bride . " What followed was as if it was being played out in slow motion as Jill lifted the veil and kissed Stephen confidently on the lips , as the girls all giggled again . <p> " Ok , who 's next ? " said Carol . <p> " Thats me , " said Eileen , rather to keenly , to make Steven comfortable . Over the next half an hour or so Steven was married to all the girls , including his sister , and by this stage he was really relaxed , carefully taking small steps and copying the way he had seen the girls walk . <p> As the last marriage was taking place and Carol was kissing Steven , the sun came out . <p> " Great , we can go up the park ! " shouted Jill , clapping her hands and doing a little dance . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the girls were leaving the room , without so much as a backward glance . <p> " What about me ? " Steven heard himself say in a very timid voice . <p> " No , you cant come . You do n't  want to get your dress dirty - you just stay here and do the tidying up , " teased Carol . <p> " And make sure you put your dress and petticoats away properly , " said Jill , which was like a dagger to Stevens already fragile heart . <p> " See you ! " chorused Margaret and Eileen and , with that , Steven heard the front door close , and he was left alone in his pretty dress and petticoats . <p> Steven wandered back into his sisters bedroom and looked at himself in the mirror . He took the veil and tiara off and put his sister 's Alice band on . He felt that he really did look like a little girl - a very young version of his mother . He went into his parents bedroom - something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see himself in the full-length mirror on his mother 's wardrobe . He spent a while in front of that mirror curtseying and pulling poses , as he had seen his mother and sister do when buying a new dress or getting ready for a night out . He wandered back into his sister 's room and began reading the teen magazines the girls had left behind . He had looked at the magazines before , but now with a completely different eye , imagining what he would look like in the different outfits . <p> " Steven , you better get your room straightened before Jack gets home , and when you 've done that , I want you to lay the table for me " . His mother 's voice brought him back to reality , and he took one last look at his reflection in the mirror , promising that he would do this again just as soon as he could . <p> Panic ! Steven couldnt reach behind to undo the hook and eyelet or the top button no matter how he tried - they just would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the dress for a matter of minutes , but it must have been longer . <p> " So there you are , " said his mother , smiling as she entered the room . <p> " The girls made me do it , they were playing dress up and Carol said ... " Steven started to blurt out the whole story . <p> " Now just come here let me give you a hand . " His mother unhooked , then unbuttoned the back of the dress . <p> " Can you get out of the rest yourself ? I really must get back to the dinner . " <p> " Leave all the clothes on the bed - I will put them away later " <p> Steven hurriedly undressed and laid everything out on the bed before putting on his own clothes and going to tidy up his room . He went down to the kitchen and his mum reminded him to get the new tablecloth from the cupboard under the stairs . <p> Steven was very quiet at dinner that night , but nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact nothing was ever mentioned again . <p> After dinner that Sunday the family sat down to watch an old western on the television ; Steven loved westerns and often thought he would like to be a cowboy when he grew up . Watching the film that night was strangely different - instead of watching for the guns , the fist fights and horse riding , Steven took more notice of the ladies , the way they walked and talked , their hair , the saloon girls ' outfits and , of course , the beautiful crinolines of the ladies at the celebration ball . <p> Although he did n't  realise it at the time things had changed for Steven , just how much he would learn in years to come but , as they say , Thats another story entirely. 
@@37517431 @6517431/ <p> Although it was over 50 years ago , I still remember my first time in petticoats in detail . <p> It was the summer that I was 7 , my brother was 9 and our sister was 11 , our father had just given my brother and me new bikes for getting good grades in school all year , as he had promised . At lunch , my brother and I started to argue about whose bike was faster and it was suggested that we have a race to decide whose was . <p> When our sister said that the winner could wear her clothes for the rest of the day , Mom laughed and said that it was n't prize either of us would want and said it was more like a penalty ; it was changed to the loser would have to wear her clothes for the rest of the day . My brother , sure that he would win , agreed to it . Mom told me not to , because I would loose , but I felt that I had to agree , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew his bike was faster . <p> When I saw that I was loosing the race , I put every bit of energy that I had into winning , but my brother was clearly the winner . My sister and I got along very well , but neither of us liked our brother much -- he had a mean streak and was often very nasty . I was laying on the grass trying to catch my breath when my sister walked over and said that she was glad that I lost because she would n't have wanted our brother wearing her clothes . Then she told me that she would find me something really nice to wear , as if she was doing me some kind of favor . <p> Our mother had packed up all her best clothes as she outgrew them and stored them in the attic . When my sister told me to take a bath while she went to the attic and found something for me to wear , I went to my mother and told her that she wanted me to take a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that she understood why my sister did n't want me wearing her clothes all sweaty and smelly , that I should do it and that maybe it would all teach me not to make dumb bets that I could n't win . <p> When I finished taking a bath and went to her room she had shoes , socks , blue panties , a full waist length petticoat , and blue dress laid out for me . I really was surprised , I had been thinking it would be shorts and a blouse or at worst a skirt . She told me to put on the petticoat then handed me the blue panties and told me to take off my underpants and put them on . When the dress was on , she saw that it was a little too small -- she said that she would be right back and went to the attic to get something else for me to wear . <p> Upon returning with a garment bag she told me that it was one of her prettiest dresses ; then she opened it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a darker pink nylon taffeta dress that had two layers of sheer organdy over the skirt and puff sleeves , pale pink panties with bright pink ruffles , a pair of pink single straps and pale pink socks with bright pink ruffles . When she handed me the ruffled panties and told me to take off the blue ones and put them on . I was dizzy and thought that I was going to pass out . As soon as I put the pink petticoat on over the white one and put the dress on over that she buttoned it , said that it fit me good , and told me to sit on the bed so she could put on the shoes and socks . I still remember the sound when I sat on the bed , it sounded so loud , everything crunched and crackled like I had sat on a pile of potato chips . <p> I looked for my mother to complain about the way she had dressed me -- everything felt so strange , nothing that I had ever worn felt anything like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise ) and I was sure that the swishing and tapping of the shoes would be heard long before I found her . My mother was n't sympathetic at all , she just told me that I looked very nice and that I should thank my sister for giving me some of her nicest clothes to wear . <p> When my brother saw me and started to tease me , I told him that it was n't that bad to try to play it down . He said that if I liked wearing girls clothes , I was a sissy , I told him that did n't say that I liked it but I was sure that he would . Our sister told him that he did n't have to be jealous , she had lots of pretty clothes that he could wear and he went off in a huff all insulted . <p> When my father came home , saw me in my sister 's clothes and found out what had transpired , I got a long lecture on how I should n't make stupid bets because I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wearing girls ' clothes was n't that bad and he shook his head and walked away . <p> In the middle of supper my father stopped eating , looked at me and said that I was to wear my sisters clothes for a week and then tell him that it was n't that bad . Then I knew that I had gotten myself in a real mess . <p> It was n't unusual for our father to take us all out for ice cream on nice Friday evenings during the summer . When after supper he said that we were going out for ice cream , I did n't want to go but I was n't given a choice . I knew that , being dressed like a girl on Easter Sunday , everyone would look at me and , with my haircut , everyone would know that I was a boy . <p> I still remember the woman smiling as she handed me my ice cream cone and saying , " Your dress is very pretty , you 're dressed very nice ... for a boy ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car and I had to stand there eating ice cream with people coming and going and standing around until everyone was done eating their ice cream . <p> Sunday mornings my father slept in while we went to church . As soon as I got up , my sister dressed me up in some of her Sunday clothes . I begged my mother to let me wear my own clothes to church but she said no , my father would probably be up when we got back , but she did get a silk scarf and tied it under my chin to cover my boys haircut . There were enough girls all dressed up that I do n't think that I was even noticed . <p> Several days later , our mother went grocery shopping and we all had to go to help carry the bags of groceries home . I was so afraid that one of my friends would see me that if I 'd have come face to face with one of them , I 'd have probably wet myself . <p> My sister always dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's full length over it . At first the front of the petticoats would bounce up and down a lot . She had me take shorter steps , not bend my knees so much and swing my whole leg forward , Though I did n't realize it at the time she was teaching me to walk like a girl . <p> By the end of the week , I was getting used to having my sister dressing me up and walking around the house in her clothes and , instead of feeling strange , I think that I started to like the way they felt . <p> When my father asked me if I still thought that wearing girls ' clothes was n't that bad or did I need another week to think about it , I begged to wear my own clothes again . It was n't because I did n't like wearing girls ' clothes but because I had n't gone out to play in a week . <p> The clothes went back to the attic for awhile , but then my sister started talking me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home alone . At first it was n't bad , it made her happy , she was always very nice to me and made it seem like fun . One day , after nearly getting caught several times , our mother was downstairs doing laundry , and she wanted to dress me up . When I refused she said that she would tell our father that I liked wearing her clothes , and that he would probably make me wear them for a month , and then she could dress me up every day again . That changed everything -- when I felt that I had no choice it took all the fun out of it . It gradually tapered off , but it was almost two years before it stopped . <p> Several times I went to the attic and dressed myself , dressing in secret , but it made me feel guilty so I stopped .

Then she sat down next to him and looked him over in an appraising manner . He seemed a little below average height for his age , a bit slim perhaps , and his features were very delicate , especially for a boy .

The ceilings were very high and there were a lot of dark shadows in the corners and hallways . He looked up into her eyes and did n't  see anything that looked like she might change her mind . He wondered why she did n't  smile more like most ladies . <p> " Well , what 's it going to be , Timmy ? We have to get started right away . Will you do as Auntiie tells you , or do you need to be convinced by a spanking with my hairbrush ? " <p> Gosh ! His mommy had never given him a spanking . But she had told him that his Auntiie could do it if he was naughty and did n't  obey her . The whole thing was so different and came about so fast that Timmy did n't  know which way to turn .

She had called and told Francine that she had an emergency , and had quite frankly explained she needed to get a nice girls hair style for a little boy . Francine let out a tired sigh on the other end of the line , and then she told Corinne to bring him right over . <p> Timmy was still in his boy clothes , and he knew only ladies and girls went to beauty salons . But his Auntiie had insisted that they had to get his hair done first before dressing him up . Timmy was in no rush to get dressed up either . The whole thing seemed really weird to him , and he <p> was surprised that his mommy had said that she wanted him to do this , even if it was for only a month .

What in Gods name is Corinne up to now , she wondered . But Corinne gave her steady business and tipped lavishly , so she tried to be accommodating with her . <p> Walking in as if she owned the place , a frozen look of superiority on her face , Corinne marched little Timmy down to the rear of the shop where Francine stood waiting for them . She gave Francine a little smile and told her she appreciated her emergency attention for Timmy , and explained hed be staying with her for a month . Then she bent down and spoke to Timmy . <p> " This is the nice lady that 's going to make your hair look pretty , Timmy . And Auntiie wants you to behave while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will , " answered a wide eyed Timmy . He felt like he had entered a sort of secret place that only girls and ladies knew about . <p> Francine sat him down in a chair and began looking at his hair . <p> " Corinne , he has lovely hair ! How did his mother ever keep it so long while he was in school ? This will be easy . When you first called up I had visions of a boy with normal short hair coming in here , which would pretty much limit us to a pixie cut . But this makes some really pretty styles possible . " <p> " Actually , " said Francine , " he probably would look best with a simple bangs and ponytail style . He s pretty cute for a boy , just in case you had n't  noticed it . Imagine how nice hed look with a pretty ribbon tied in a bow around the base of his ponytail ! Really .

Why do n't  I give him a nice shampoo while he s here , and then well see what it looks like in a ponytail ? " <p> " Very well , " said Corinne . " While you 're shampooing his hair I want to step over to Cherry &amp; Webb and pick up a few things . " Francine smiled knowingly at Corinne . Cherry &amp; Webb was a women and girls store , and she suspected little Timmy would be having a portion of his new wardrobe picked out for him while she worked on his hair . Corinne turned , her heels clicking away on the tile floor and disappeared out the door . <p> " So , Timmy , " said Francine , " you 're going to be a nice girl for Auntiie for a whole month . Are you excited ? " <p> " No , " said Timmy sullenly , " but mommy says I have to do what Auntiie says while she 's away . " <p> " Oh , Timmy , " said Francine .

And you and Auntiie will do lots of nice things together , too . " <p> In back of him some women were sittting under dryers , and all of them had caught on to what was happening to Timmy . They smiled at Timmy . <p> Timmy was thinking about the girls in his class at school . Girls did look pretty , but he did n't  understand why they wanted to . And they acted different . He did n't  see what was so much fun about being a girl . They never seemed to do anything interesting . But they smiled and laughed a lot . And most of the time , it was a boy the teacher would have to speak to for being naughty in class . He made a little sigh and looked up at the salon lady as she combed his hair . She smiled down at him sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shampoo his hair . <p> By the time Auntiie walked back into the salon , Timmy was back in the first chair after being under a dryer for a little while . Francine had tied a pretty ribbon bow on his ponytail . And she had already cut and arranged some delicate looking bangs on his forehead . <p> Corinne approached Timmy with mild curiosity . After all , he was still just a little boy . Then she got a good look at him . WELL ! ! ! This was quite interesting ! Francines instincts concerning not only his hair , but the shape of his head and face had been right . He really did look remarkably pretty with bangs and a ponytail , and the shampoo gave his hair a nice sheen . Corinne folded her arms and studied him carefully . He really looks quite good , she thought . <p> Francine turned to Corinne with a big grin . Obviously she was proud of her work . She was working the comb through his ponytail to give it a little upward flip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Timmys natural curl was still there . She had picked a pink ribbon to tie a bow with . That blond hair seemed to shout for pink as a pretty contrast . <p> Timmy felt out of sorts . He had known from the way the other boys at school kidded him that he had a kind of pretty face and then mommy started letting his hair grow long , too . But now the way the salon lady had fixed him up really made him look like a girl . <p> " Corinne , " said Francine as she rummaged through her purse , " let me put just a tiny touch of make-up on him . " <p> " Go right ahead , " said Corinne , becoming more interested by the minute . Soon Timmy had a little mascara on his lashes , had a few eyebrow hairs plucked out , was wearing just a hint of lipstick , and had a little very light rouge rubbed onto his cheeks by Francines finger tip . <p> " There ! Now that 's how he should look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . Timmy really did make a passable girl ; in fact a pretty girl . She thanked Francine , paid her and included a very generous tip , took Timmys hand and marched him out of the salon . He could feel his ponytail bouncing against the back of his head and neck as he walked . <p> " Goodbye , Timmy . Have a nice time , sweetheart , " called out Francine . <p> They got into Auntiies car and Timmy noticed several large shopping bags and some large flat boxes on the back seat . When they got home , he helped Auntiie carry them into his bedroom . Then she began to open them all . <p> " This wont be enough for a month , Timmy , " said Auntiie , " but itll get you started . Well shop some more for you in a day or two . " <p> Timmy went over to a little mirror hanging on the wall and looked at his face . The ponytail with the pretty bow , the bangs and the make-up , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at himself without smiling . <p> " How do you like yourself , now , Timmy ? " asked Auntiie . <p> " II look like a girl , Auntiie , " he said in a quiet voice . <p> " Well , girls look prettier when they smile , dear , " she replied . <p> Timmy made a little smile and saw that she was right . He did look prettier when he smiled . <p> " Timmy , go start to fill the tub up with warm water while I put away your clothes , dear . When its about half way filled , call me . " <p> " Yes , Aunt Corinne , " he said , and started off towards the bathroom . When the tub was half filled he stepped into the hallway and called his aunt . She came towards him without any smile , a look of all business on her face . Soon the tub was filled and Timmy , a little bath cap protecting his shampooed hair , was almost hidden by a mountain of nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , " said Auntiie , " while I finish putting your things away . Try not to get your face wet and spoil your make-up . " She picked up his boy clothes and held them out away from her as if they might contaminate her dress . Timmy never did see them again . <p> Auntiie returned with a little summer weight girls robe for him , made sure he was adequately clean , and then told him to dry himself off with a fluffy towel on the rack . <p> " Once you 're dry and have your robe on , come back to your bedroom , " she told him and disappeared into the hallway . When he got to his bedroom Corinne was sitting on the edge of his bed smoking a cigarette . An ashtray from the living room was on his nightstand . <p> " Sit down , Timmy , " she said , sounding about as inviting as a dentist . He sat down next to her and looked up at her .

You have to learn how to act and behave like a girl , and you have to learn it quick . I 'm not going to lose a whole month training you to be a girl . I have too many other things I want to do . Just about all of them , you 'll be doing with me . And you have to look and act like a nice girl . Do you understand ?

" She got up and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute , and then took her choices over to the bed where she laid them out . While Timmy was looking at them , she turned and went to a chest of drawers and came back with some panties and some girls anklet socks . <p> " Take off your robe , dear , and let 's put these nice panties on you , " said Corinne . They were cute light pink cotton panties with little darker pink hearts all over them and little white lace at the leg openings . She pulled them up to his waist . <p> " Why do they have hearts on them ? " asked Timmy . <p> " Because they 're for sweethearts , dear , " said Corinne . " Just like you 'll be . " Then she lifted a white bouffant slip over his head and told him to raise his arms . The lace trimmed straps settled onto his shoulders and the rest of it went on down to his knees . It had three layers to it , and Timmy was surprised how smooth the layer next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white netting that poufed out and finally a stiff parchment nylon overskirt that had pink ribbons going around it , a lot of lace , and a big pink bow . It stuck out from his legs a lot . <p> " That fits you quite well , dear , " said Corinne . She did n't  bother to ask him if he liked it . <p> " Now sit down on the bed again , Timmy , and well put your anklets and shoes on . " The anklet socks were pink but had white lace tops that Auntiie folded down over his ankles . Then came a pair of white Mary Jane shoes with a strap and buckle that Auntiie fastened . <p> " There , " said Auntiie , getting back to her feet . " Now its time for your dress . Just think , Timmy . This is your first dress . But therell be a lot more to come . " <p> The dress she had picked was pink like his socks . It had short puffed sleeves with plain white trim , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white zig-zags went across his chest . There were more of them going around the middle of the skirt . Auntiie called them ric-rac . She went in back of him and began to button it up . Afterwards she took the two loose ends of a pink sash and tied them into a big bow in the small of his back . <p> As soon as she was finished , she took his hand and led him into her room where there was a full length mirror . She stood next to him , still holding his hand as they looked at the reflection of themselves . Timmy remained quiet . <p> " There , " said Corinne . " Do n't  you think you look better now ? " <p> " II look just like a girl , Auntiie , " said Timmy . <p> " Yes , you do , " said Corinne . " And this is the way Maryanne is going to look for a month . So you better get used to it . " <p> " Maryanne ? " asked Timmy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's going to be your name while you 're a girl . Your mommy likes that name . Do you like it ? " <p> Timmy shrugged his shoulders . " I guess so , Auntiie . " <p> " Now come along to the living room , dear . We have to begin your training . " <p> In the living room , Corinne immediately began teaching him the little habits and manners of girls concerning how they sat down , walked , talked , stood politely while they had to wait for something , and little things girls did regarding their dresses , such as fluffing them up and smoothing out the wrinkles from their skirts . Maryanne found it boring , especially when Corinne made him sit down and then get back up a dozen times , always smoothing his dress behind him when he sat down , keeping his feet and knees together , etc . <p> He had to learn to walk like a girl , not swinging his arms , but just letting them hang relaxed along the sides of his dress , taking smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slouching was definitely forbidden ! Then came his talking . He must always talk in a soft , clear voice and never ever use slang . It was alright for Maryanne to call her Auntiie when they were home alone , but when they went out anywhere , he must always call her Aunt Corinne . And he must never ever interrupt ladies when they were talking , or contradict Auntiie or any other lady . <p> " One other thing , Maryanne , " said Auntiie . " If I ever catch you taking a pee standing up it will mean an instant hairbrush spanking . Do you understand ? You sit down like a nice girl from now on . " <p> " Yes , Auntiie , " said Maryanne in a soft voice . <p> Then there were a lot of rules about what he was expected to do around the house . The guest room was going to be decorated by the maid tomorrow to make it look more suitable for a girl . He would keep it spotless and never leave clothes lying around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as something needed laundering , he was to put it in the bathroom hamper . Because of all the antiques , Maryanne would have to always move slowly and carefully through the house . Running , inside or outside the house , was forbidden . Only tomboys ran . He was going to behave like a little lady . <p> " When were visiting one of my nice friends , Maryanne , " explained Corinne , " you should smile nice and tell them its nice to meet them . Always say please and thank you when you should . Little girls should just remain quiet and still unless they are spoken to . Sit up nice and straight with your hands in your lap and simply be quiet . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes , Auntiie , " answered Maryanne , wondering where all the fun was girls were supposed to have . <p> " Maryanne , " said Corinne , " there are a lot more things you have to learn , and I do n't  expect you to be able to remember them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to learn them as soon as possible . Besides , acting and behaving like a girl will make you feel more like a girl . And do n't  forget what I told you a little while ago : until your mommy gets back , you are no longer a boy . You 're a girl . If I suspect that you are pretending you forgot to do something the right way , you 'll feel the hairbrush on your bottom . I know you 'll make a few mistakes at first , but you have to learn as much as you can as fast as you can . I wont have you embarrassing me when we go out . " <p> " Yes , Aunt Corinne , " replied Maryanne in a subdued voice . <p> " Sit down here next to me , " said Corinne . Maryanne sat down , smoothing his dress behind him and kept his feet and knees together . He sat up straight and placed his hands in his lap after he brushed away a couple of wrinkles with this hands . Corinne smiled slightly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get used to wearing a nice dress , dear ? " asked Corinne . <p> " Wellnot really , Auntiie , " he answered . " It all still seems kind of weird and silly to me . But I 'll do it since mommy wants me to . " <p> " And because I say you have to , Maryanne , " she reminded him . <p> " Yes , Auntiie , " replied Maryanne softly . <p> " You know , Maryanne , Auntiie is really doing you a big favor . " <p> " You are ? " he asked . <p> " Oh , yes , dear , " she answered . " You see , ladies and girls are much better persons than men and boys . They act nicer , keep themselves looking nice , are much cleaner , and are smarter , too . I bet the girls in your class at school get better marks than most of the boys . " <p> " Gosh , Auntiie ! I think they do , " said Maryanne . " I never thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Corinne suddenly found herself primping the bow on Maryannes ponytail . It was something pretty automatic for most women to do , but Corinne was surprised at herself . She 'd seldom even touched any child before now . <p> Then the phone rang , and Corinne began a lengthy conversation with one of her friends . Timmy continued sitting on the couch for a while , but Auntiie became pretty involved in discussing some country club gossip . Finally she put her hand over the mouthpiece and beckoned him over to her . <p> " Maryanne , I 'll be busy for a little while . You practice walking and sitting down around the house like a good girl . " <p> " Yes , Auntiie , " he answered , glad he could move around instead of just sitting there . Corinne went back to her gossip . <p> He left the living room and wandered down a hallway to a little room that was filled with books , just like his mommys library room . He walked in , his hands at the sides of his dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather wingback chair . <p> He looked down at his dress covering his legs and brushed away a wrinkle with his hands . He still did n't  understand any of this . It did n't  make any sense to him . He knew that Auntiie did n't  like boys , but even if he had a ponytail and dressed like a girl , he was still a boy . He began to wonder if maybe it was some kind of a game or joke she wanted to play on her friends , fooling them into thinking he was a girl . But why would she want to do that ? And why did his mommy tell him that she thought being a girl would be good for him ? He gave up trying to figure it out for now and began to look around . <p> There was a window near his chair that looked out across Auntiies big lawn to the street . Suddenly he saw three boys coming along the sidewalk . He got up from his chair and got closer to the window . As the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . He stepped back behind the drape alongside the window so they would n't see him and took a peek at them . But the boys were busy talking about something and did n't  even look over at Auntiies house . Pretty soon they were gone . <p> Timmy sat back down , feeling a little scared . He looked down at his dress again and began to wonder . What if the boys had seen him getting out of Auntiies car with a pink ribbon on his ponytail ? Or what if they saw him later today or tomorrow all dressed up like a girl ? If they recognized him it would be awful ! Pretty soon all the kids at school would know he had been wearing girls clothes . He might just as well run away to someplace far away , like Alaska or Africa . He wondered if mommy would come with him . But not Aunt Corinne . He sighed and lowered his head . He knew he was n't going to run away anywhere . He had to stay here so mommy could make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . It would be the end of July before he could dress and act like a regular boy again . He could n't see where there was any fun to being a girl , despite what Auntiie had told him . And he sure did n't  think she was doing him a favor like she said . The dress was comfortable on him , but felt funny because it was so different . And the lower half of his legs were bare . A good thing its warm now , he thought . <p> He did n't  like it . He did n't  like wearing girls clothes , or having a ponytail and bangs , or having to learn how to act like a girl . It all seemed crazy to him . Wearing panties and a poufy slip and dress made him feel squirmy inside . And he did n't  like Aunt Corinne either . He thought she was mean to be making him do this . He did n't  know why mommy said it would be good for him . But she had , and that puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be anything he could do about it . <p> He left the little library room and went up to his Auntiies bedroom and stood in front of the big mirror again . He really did look like a girl . As long as he acted and talked like one , maybe no one would know he was a boy . Why did he look like he did ? The other boys at school all looked like regular boys . Why did he have a sort of girls face even before Auntiie dressed him up ? And why did mommy like to keep his hair so long ? <p> He was still looking at himself when Corinne came into the room . <p> She stopped next to him and looked at his reflection in the mirror with him . <p> " I meant to tell you , Maryanne , " she said , " its a good thing for girls to look at themselves in the mirror whenever they get the chance so they can see if they look alright . You would n't want to be walking around all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would you ? " <p> " No , Auntiie , " he answered . <p> " Thats a good girl , " Auntiie said . " After a while a lot of girl things will become automatic for you . Now its getting near dinner time . I do n't  feel like cooking tonight , so well eat out in a nice restaurant . " <p> Timmy groaned inwardly to himself . It was bad enough dressing and acting like a girl here . But going out where people would be seeing him really worried him . <p> " Do we have to , Auntiie ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , Maryanne , " she replied . " And it will do you good , too . As long as you act like a nice girl , you 'll be surprised how people will think you are one . You certainly look like one . All you have to do is act like Auntiie has been telling you to . Besides , its about time you learned how nice it is in a really good restaurant where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auntiie ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , " she replied . " Like my friends . " <p> The trip to the fancy restaurant turned out to be no big deal , but it did n't  start out that way . Wearing white gloves and with his purse hanging from his shoulder , he had entered the restaurant with Auntiie , tripped in the deep carpeting , and fell in a heap , his dress and slip all in disarray , his sweetheart panties in plain view . A man at a nearby table jumped up and helped Maryanne to his feet . Auntiie shook her head and thanked the man for his assistance . Then they straightened out his slip and dress and sat down . Pretty soon , Maryanne was eating the first shrimp cocktail hed ever had . Later , after they had finished their dinner and were driving back home , Auntiie said a strange thingfor her . <p> " Maryanne , I 'm sorry you fell down when we entered , " she said . " It was really my fault . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . I 'm sorry , dear . " <p> " Oh , that 's okay , Aunt Corinne , " he replied . " I 've fallen down a lot when I 've been playing with my pals . " <p> That night Auntiie showed him how to hang up his things , washed his face , combed and brushed out his pretty hair , and gave him a cotton baby doll nightie to wear . It was pretty , but it was even shorter than his dress and slip . He wondered why girls did n't  cover up their legs . He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up . Corinne looked down at him , but did n't  smile or make any attempt to tuck him in like mommy did , or to give him a goodnight kiss , either . <p> " Sleep well , Maryanne , " she said . " We have a busy day tomorrow . " <p> " What will we be doing , Auntiie ? " he asked . <p> " You and I will visit one of my older friends . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ever embarrass me in front of one of my friends , your bottom will be sore for a week . Good night , dear . " With that she turned around and left the room , shutting off the light and closing the door . <p> Maryanne lay thinking about everything that had happened to him that day . It still seemed so strange . He did n't  want to be a girl . Why wouldnt Auntiie let a boy stay with her ? He had always acted nice when he and mommy visited her before . And even though his hair was in a girls ponytail and bangs , and he had worn a dress and things all day , she did n't  seem to like him any better . He wished he did n't  have to do this . Auntiie scared him , too . She was even taller than mommy and she hardly ever smiled at him . He turned his head sideways on the pillow and cried a little bit . He did n't  like being a girl at all . Why was this happening to him , he kept wondering . 
@@37517433 @6517433/ <p> I 'm not sure where you are from but if you remember about four years ago(1994)the North American east coast got hit by a really big snow storm . The day that that storm hit I had gone to visit an old friend , from highschool , in northeRn Ontario ( where they average at least three to four feet of snow during the winter ) . What I did n't know was that there had been a water main that had burst on her property . Guess what ? Lucky me found out where it was because I fell through the ice into the hole that the bursting pipe had made . I was drenched ( and freezing ) and as luck would have it the clothes in my bag were soaked as well because the zipper was broken . I dragged myself out of the hole and stiffly walked to my friend 's door ( her name was Angela ) to let her know that I was there . As luck ( I 'm now thinking fate ) would have it the power was out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela suggested that we go into town ( the town was already in the boondocks and she was twenty miles out of town ) to a coin laundry and dry my clothes . We got in my car and warmed it up real good . Just as we were getting ready to pull out , we heard on the radio that all the roads into ( and out of ) town were closed because the plows could n't handle the snow in town yet alone the snow outside of town . We also heard that the power was expected to be out for at least another twenty hours . I thought great now I guess that I 'll freeze to death . <p> We went inside and to my surprise Angela said that she did have something that would fit me . I asked her what it was and Angela said that she had her sister 's old wedding gown ( size 26 ) . At this point I felt like a little kid on their birthday and because I did n't really have a choice I told her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and her surprise ) the gown ( without a petticoat ) was a perfect fit . I wore the gown ( without underwear ) until the power came back on . The power ended coming back on around 5:00PM the next day ( Sunday I think ) and by then it had stopped snowing . Angela saw that I was n't in any hurry to take off the wedding gown , so she said that if I was going to continue to wear the wedding gown ( I felt like I was in heaven ) , I should at least try to look the part . By the end of that day Angela had me wearing silk stockings , a garter belt and a hand-made multi-tiered satin-lined tulle petticoat ( that she made that night ) under the wedding gown as well as false breasts ( the glue on kind ) . I did n't wear a bra or panties because Angela did n't have any large enough for me ( she was only a size 6 - I 'm still jealous ) . My hair was already down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she did n't need to do anything to it , except to wash and brush it . By noon on Monday the snow plows finally cleared the roads heading into town ( my clothes had already thawed out and dried on their own after the power came on ) . Angela suggested going into town and she told me to keep the wedding gown on . I gave her a look and she told me that I could pass as a large homely girl ( I did n't have any make-up on ) . She also told me that some houses in a nearby town had been broken in to , and the only things that had been stolen had been the female clothing . The first place that we went to was a Bridal Salon that was at time owned by a friend of Angela 's . Angela wanted to make sure that I had everything that was neccesary for a bride to wear , including a veil . By the time that we got back to her place , Angela had bought me two white satin bras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two silk blouses ( one white , one emerald green ) with matching tea-length silk skirts , two tea-length silk dresses ( one white , one royal blue ) , two tea-length petticoats , two garter belts and two floor-length silk nightgowns ( one black , one semi-sheer white ) . I wore a pair of white panties and a bra home underneath the wedding gown along with everything else that I had worn when we left Angela 's house . I ended up being Angela 's ' girlfriend ' until I had to reluctantly leave to head home about two weeks later . <p> When I did leave Angela 's , I left as Darlene . As I was leaving Angela 's place she handed me a package and told me not to open it until I got home . On my way home I reluctantly stopped at a gas station and changed back in Darren , mainly because of my parents who I still live with . My father considers all crossdressers to be gay , and believe me I 'm as straight as a nail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela had given me . To my pleasant surprise inside was a teal silk blouse , a black tea-length silk skirt , a ruby red tea-length silk dress , a tea-length petticoat , a white satin bra , a pair of satin panties , a pair of silk stockings , a garter belt and a pink floor-length silk nightgown , none of which was bought when Angela had bought the rest of my wardrobe that stayed at her place . After I laid everything out I noticed something else was wrapped up at the bottom of the package . I took it out and carefully unwrapped it . To my pleasant surprise it was a hot pink floor-length satin bridesmaid gown . <p> Two years ago Angela was killed a traffic accident . Unforunately I was n't able to get to Angela 's place before her parents cleaned out her closets and dressers . My wardrobe that Angela kept for me was given to charity by her parents which at the time include two wedding gowns that she had bought as gifts and almost two dozen petticoats and crinolines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( May 3rd &amp; 4th , 1997 ) I was away and she decided to clean out the guest room closet . Guess what , she thought that my wardrobe were clothes that had belonged to a dead cousin of mine that had lived with us about eight years ago . When I got home from the weekend my wardrobe was gone to the Salvation Army , so unknown to my parents I still have two silk nightshirts . One ( white ) which I am currently wearing . I really hope that I can find a job soon , that way I can get my own apartment and restock my wardrobe . My personal favourites for dressing are wedding gowns , bridesmaid dresses , skirts , blouses &amp; dresses that are made from satin or silk , silk pajamas , satin panties and long silk flowing nightgowns . <p> One fantasy that I have is to get locked in a Bridal Salon ( must carry at least size 24 ) that also sells lingerie . It would be paradise because I would try on everything that was size 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary was a beautiful girl and she took great care of her appearance and taught me to as well . Those beautiful weekends , in her bedroom , left to our own devices . Not only did I wear her clothes , but we ? raided ' her mother 's closets , we were size-compatible . . . She was lonely girl , her parent tolerated her and her brother ignored her when he was home or was away at Gordonstone learning to be a " man ! " . Not only did we both share the excitement of what we were doing , there was a great deal of affection between us too . I 'll never forget the phone call late one evening from her barely intelligible mother saying she was staying at a friends , one of her lovers no doubt . But ! ! ! ! We were alone ! The whole house , to ourselves . We looked at each other guiltily and then grinned . Curtains were drawn , lights turned off downstairs , doors checked and then . Upstairs . We soaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot scented water . She said , " This will be our first night together " her eyes bright , almost feverish . She leaned close and whispered " I have a special treat for you . . " And with that , she climbed out of the tub and wrapped in a big towel , disappeared , I heard he go down the hallto her mother 's bedroom . . . I relaxed in the hot water for a while and then got out and dried myself in one of the gigantic , fluffy towels . I dried my hair carefully , it was longer now and I was taking care to make sure it had a feminine look . . I was pleased with the result . My figure was slim and my shape was that of a girl 's . . . Putting on my dressing gown , I padded off down the long hall to my room which was next to hers in the east wing . I knocked on the connecting door and it flew open and she came in . . . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No cheating ! " She put her finger on my lips . . . and sealed them . She used this a lot , it was her way of taking control of me . . . I was her beloved slave . I closed my eyes and she led me into her room stopped , she closed the door , took my hand again and led me , I guessed , to the bed . She whispered " Open your eyes . . " I did - and nearly fainted with pleasure . There , on her large bed , carefully laid out , was the most beautiful frilly nightdress I have ever seen ! " My mum bought that years ago , but never wore it . . . Dad was always too tired or working " she grinned . " It 's pure silk . . " It was snow white silk . Ribbons adorned the puffed sleeves and frills were everywhere ! She gently took my dressing gown off me , let it drop to the floor and then reached for the nightdress ( she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ) . She held it against me , studying my face , judging the effect it was having . When I felt the material touch my skin , I shuddered in ecstasy and closed my eyes , letting out a long , soft moan of pure pleasure . She slipped it over my head and it cascaded down around me and an erotic fog of silk caressed my skin . She led me to the mirror , and as I walked , I could feel the rows of frills on the hem caressing me , walking in this garment had become an act of poetic lust ! I looked at the reflection and melted yet again , I was beautiful . I looked like a young , honeymoon dream and Mary stood there , hypnotized , her eyes glowing with pleasure . She told me to lie on the bed and then she quickly slipped into one of her baby-pink silky Baby-Dolls . She twirled around , the hem floating in the air and then went to her closet and collected nighties , petticoats and going to the drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . I will never forget the night that followed . . I have never in my whole life experienced such undiluted erotic pleasure . I was in lingerie heaven , with a girl I adored who , treated me as a girl ! It was a lesbian , lingerie love story . . . <p> This passion of mine is now part of my being and as I sit here writing this now , I am wearing a white negligee over a pink nightdress . . . And I love it ! 
@@37517434 @6517434/ <h> PATTY 'S PLIGHT <p> Patrick did n't  really mind the calf-length petticoats so much , although the boys DID tease him when and if they passed the house and saw his plight ; along with the pantaloons , they felt nice against his legs . It was the stays that really bothered him . Not only were they tight , but also they prevented him from doing most activities of boys of his age he could never catch his breath ! And if he COULD play that way , well , he would n't want to expose himself to the other boys ridicule and teasing . Furthermore , if he mussed his frock , or even his pinafore , well , it would mean even more punishment . <p> The Ryan family matriarch was well known for her methods of her handling unruly grandsons and great-grandsons . She expected them to grow up as " gentle-men . " Lacing them into stays prevented them from getting into trouble but the rest of the dress was punitive : Whenever a Ryan boy got into trouble , well , it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . An eternity of humiliation , in boys time ! During that period , the wrongdoer stayed home and did his studies there , making up schoolwork the following week that was a punishment as well . <p> But it was n't just the dressing that bothered him : It was also having to permit all of his sisters to dress him every day . And doing female chores with them . Furthermore , if he did not do them right , his skirts were pulled up and he was put over Grams knee and spanked , in front of all the children . <p> This was Patricks third time in such straits . Try as he might , he was always in trouble ( boy will be boys ! ) . Some of the boys DID " learn their lesson " after one such bout ; but Patrick was not one of them . <p> ** ** ** ** <p> The Saturday had begun fairly non-eventful . Patrick and some of his friends were playing ball in the front yard , and , very quickly , the game ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others immediately ran off , and Patrick was alone to take the blame . He quickly knew what the future held as watched the errant ball sail toward the window , causing a loud shattering noise , promptly followed by Grams appearance at the front door . <p> " Ruffian ! This the second time you have done this ! Wash you hands and face and go to Marthas room ! Immediately ! " <p> There was no use in protesting . There never was . But he figured hed try . <p> " But , Gram . I cant stay home from school next week its finals ! " <p> " Well , then , you will have to go to school in your Patty dress . " <p> " But Gram cant we wait until next week , so I can stay home ? The others will never let me live it down ! " <p> " Should have thought about that when you broke the glass ! Brought this on yourself , boy . Go now , " waving her hand in a shoo motion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a girl at home but at school ? This was terrible ! He trudged up the steps . He knew his sisters would be coming up soon . He was trapped . <p> As he entered Marthas room , that now-familiar feeling came over him once again , of being out of place in all the frills and laces and light colors . He hated the ridicule and humiliation , but he had to admit to himself that he kind of liked the feel of pantaloons and skirts on his legs . It was the darned stays that bothered so much , especially when his sisters decided to have fun and tie them too tight ! He could hardly breathe ! <p> As he waited , he walked over the large armoire in the corner , where all the girls older dresses were kept . Opening the door , he began running his hand across them , in an idle manner , wondering which he would be forced to wear . <p> " They really are so pretty , " he thought . He remembered this one he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to hold a memory . Most unpleasant from the humiliation , but some were not so bad . <p> Herethis green frock ... what a day that was ! <p> He remembered it well ; it was a rather windy , but warm , day this past early spring . His brother Harold , feeling sorry for him , and wanting to console him , took him up the hill to the south field for a little picnic . It was there , for the first time , that Patty got a sense of how a girl must feel in a similar situation he was surprised that he rather liked it . It seemed incongruous to him that Harold call him Patrick with he in a pretty dress with ribbons in his hair , so he insisted he called him Patty . His brother did , awkwardly at first , but after awhile , Harold seemed to begin behaving toward Patty the way he acted toward all girls gentlemanly . It was strange feeling , especially since Patty was only twelve . He even helped him with his skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Harold even had difficulty picking a subject for conversation something he never had before . Patty surmised that his garb presented itself to Harold as female , making it difficult for him to relate to him as a boy a boy in petticoats . The illusion was furthered by the fact that his hair was even longer than a boys after his first week in frocks , Gram never allowed his hair to be cut . <p> Once , that first time , Patty had begged Harold to loosen his stays for a short while , which he did while they hid in a closet . Of course , his frock had to remain open until Harold retightened it . But this time his brother demurred , saying something vague about having hurt his hand , and therefore , he could not retighten him . After that day , he never related again to him the same things were just different , and Harold was always gentle toward Patty , even when Patty was not in dresses . <p> Yes , the green dress with the floral pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into the room interrupted his reverie - his hands were still on the dresses . <p> " For now , " said Bernice . " The others will be here soon . Finishing a chore . What did you get yourself into this time , bad girl ? " <p> Patty scowled . <p> " Some of those dressesohI mightily wish I could still wear them ! " said Martha , sighing , with her hand to her bosom . <p> " Me , too ! I guess well have to live vicariously though our littlesister ! " <p> Delilah and Francine , the twins , just then entered . They were older than the other two , and were into the long skirts appropriate to their age . <p> " Oh ! Those short dresses - our girlhood ! " exclaimed Delilah , seeing the rack in the open closet . " <p> " Pswah ! said Martha , " You are STILL girls . " <p> " Let 's get going , " said Francine . <p> " Please , my sisters , do n't  tie me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure that you understand what WE go through , " said Francine . <p> " You made your point ! " <p> " Well see , " said Delilah . " Let 's get you into your under things . Take off those horrid boy clothes . " <p> This was the part he hated . Being naked , even for a moment in front of his older sisters . Sometimes he wished he had a younger sister on whom to take out his frustrations and ever since that time on the hill , his older brother was of no help in any attempt to shield him . It was a dismaying situation . And now ! Now he would have to face his schoolmates face-to face ! Patty felt like crawling into a hole . The only consolation was the feel of the petticoats and pantaloons on his legs ; he REALLY liked that but he could NEVER admit that to ANY ne , least of all his sisters . He would never live it down ! <p> Slowly , he removed his trousers , shirt , shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Please " <p> " Go aheadtake them off , " said Francine . Her voice was not harsh , and the others , while they felt no compunction about all of this , were not about to allow him privacy to put on his feminine undergarments , what with Grams strict orders and terrible punitive disposition when it came to punishment . They would make sure it was done right . <p> He removed his undershirt and , then , slowly , with great reticence , removed his underpants , putting his hands over his crotch . He had placed his clothing in a neat pile on the floor . He knew that the first chore after he was dressed would be to wash both his male clothing and the girls as well . <p> " All right , " said Martha . " Let 's see what we have for you " <p> While Patty just stood there , she brought out a cotton camisole , linen pantaloons , and a pair of black stockings . <p> " Sit on the bed , Patty . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to past her knees . " Good thing you have no hair on your legs yucky ! Yours are just like a girls ! " <p> Patty ignored her and looked up at the ceiling , all the while trying to keep his privates hidden with his hands . Yes , I imagine the clothing would n't feel so good if I had hair on my legs . <p> " Stand up ! Francine , would you put on his , that is , her underclothing ? " All the sisters seemed a bit shy , in a girlish fashion ( particularly the younger ones ) , not directly looking at Pattys nakedness ; all the same , they did allow themselves a peek here and there . And , of course , the girls who actually applied the clothing had the best view and did n't  have to avert their eyes . A little giggling DID take place now and then . After all , a girl can not help herself ! <p> When Patty finally was no longer naked , ( s ) he felt more comfortable able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first touch of female clothing , he began to THINK differently , as if by magic . It was as if the clothing made himsofter , more vulnerable less prone to object to orders . ( S ) he feltwell , cozy ! <p> " Time for the lacing , Patty ! Said Martha . " I know you asked us not to make it that tight , but , Patty it is clear that we must tighten you enough to get you into a dress , and the only size we have means you will have to be tighter than even the last time , because you have grown a bit ! We have no larger sizes at this point that are not TOO large , and Gram will not permit us to alter , or even to teach YOU to alter , any of the dresses . She says you will just have to live with it . I 'm sorry . " <p> Patty groaned . Being tight was one thing , but having to do chores while so laced was even worse ! ( S ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The act seemed to calm her when she was upset . No doubt , the girls noticed , as they did in the past , because they glanced at each other with a little smile . <p> Patty went over to the high lacing bar in the other corner , and grabbed hold , as Martha placed the pretty blue satin corset about her waist . It was fairly long , ending under where the bust might be if she were a mature woman . At this time , since Patty was only twelve , she was not expected to have breasts and the dresses she wore at this stage were cut as a childs <p> One day , should her dresses period continue , she would be into long dresses and padding in her bodice , much as her older brother had been for a short time before he learned to behave and not act like a ruffian . <p> Patty sighed deeply , then , as always , and as instructed , took deep breath and held it while the girls gathered around to close her busk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , the girls were very slow and gentle with lacings , and stopped about two inches short of their goal . They were really not mean Patty , nonetheless , suffered , not used to such constriction , and she knew they were not finished . If they stopped here , I could do this . <p> " Pretty girls have tiny waists , little sister Patty ! " exclaimedDelilah , unable to resist . The rest giggled . Patty did n't  see the humor . Besides her mind was not on this as much as if she had n't  been staring down and admiring her pantaloons with the pretty pale blue dainty flowers . <p> But the reprise was only for the settling in , as they called it . Now they proceeded with the rest of Pattys dressing routine . <p> After assisting Patty down from the all-too-familiar bar , the girls escorted her back over to the armoire area . <p> " All right , Patty , " said Francine . With your pretty blue corset , you may wear a pretty blue dress ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Martha already had a pile of petticoats in her arms , and she produced the first , which was of pink taffeta . <p> " So rustley ! " said Francine . " Mind you take care of this ! It is our favorite for daytime use ! Besides , you would not want to disappoint Gram ! " She pulled it over Pattys head and down over her new waist , fastening it there with the attached cord . The girls could not help notice the difference in Pattys demeanor . A far-off look had come to her eyes . <p> Again , the sisters looked at each other but his time they were not smiling . <p> Delilah said , " Is our little brother all right ? " Her use of the word brother instead of sister signified her concern . <p> " Oh Oh , yes , I amfine . These stays , " said Patty as if catching herself and coming out of a trance . <p> But it was clear to him , and perhaps to the girls , that her new clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? <p> Clearing his head , he said , " All right , sisters , let 's get this over with . " <p> " Yes , Patty , " said Martha . " We shall lace you in slowly . " <p> The taffeta petticoat felt marvelous ! The rustling and the slippery feel were delightful . Patty was getting scared . I am NOT a girl ! <p> Unbeknownst to Patty , her sisters had noticed his erection , and were hiding their glances from each , the younger very embarrassed , the older ones tolerant and kind . <p> Next came a polished cotton petticoat , in white . Floating down over her head , Patty was mesmerized . It became very difficult for her to maintain her composure . It appeared that the more layers of petticoat were applied , the more of an ethereal experience followed . But this time she quickly shook it off , coming to her senses , as if she said to herself STOP ! I 'm not going to let this happen ! <p> But telling herself to stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DID have to consciously maintain her masculinity to her sisters . So her sisters did not , in this case , realize her state . <p> Finally , a very light wool petticoat topped the other three , adding to the fullness , and thus , Pattys euphoria . But her face was neutral . <p> " There ! " said Francine . All ready for your dress . But first , the lacing ! " <p> Back to the dreaded lacing bar , where Patty knew her misery would begin . But the heaviness of her petticoats , and the pleasant rustling , keep her in a decent frame of mind . <p> As her sisters pulled and tugged and adjusted , Patty tried to think of more pleasant things she daydreamed she was on a billowing white cloud , sliding within its folds , lace all around the edges . Well , she kept drifting in and out of this dream , as she was now and then abruptly brought to reality by the ever-increasing tightness in her waist , brought about by the constant tugging . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! That I could just be in floating petticoats and soft pantaloons and pretty ! I HATE corsets ! <p> But the fantasy could not persist in the ever-increasing grip of her stays . <p> " Oohh ! Please ! " Patty gasped she was having a difficult time , as she fought to breathe . <p> " Its all right , Patty only one more inch ! " she heard Francine say through the haze . <p> " But I cantbreathe ! " <p> " Do like we taught you last time Breathe from your upper chest ! <p> " II wanttoplease " <p> <p> The smelling salts did their job . Patty awoke in a haze . Looking up , she saw all the girls around her , looking at her with concern . <p> She was on Marthas beautiful pink , lace adorned canopy bed A dark blue cotton dress hung from the canopy hers ? Her layers of petticoats billowed up from her legs , and contrasted nicely with her now-tiny waist . Her stomach hurt a bit , but she was all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fascinate Patty . While she put out her arms , the pinafore was tied in a big bow in the back and the skirt adjusted to fall just short of her dress . <p> " There ! That will keep my old pretty dress clean ! " exclaimed Martha . <p> " This wasyours ? " <p> " Yes and she never looked as good as you in it ! " shouted Francine . <p> They all had a good laugh , including Patty . She was beginning to feel much better . She loved the dress , and the pinafore as well , and she was feeling VERY kindly toward her sisters - sisterly . Sisterly ? I feel like one of the girls ! Wait ! No ! I can not let this happen . I am NOT a girl . <p> Pattys demeanor suddenly changed , and she became morose . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Nothing . I mean , well , I mean do not feel I should be feeling good about this . I am a boy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty . We 've had to do this before , and you did n't  feel this way . " <p> " Well , yesbut you are dressed as a girl right now . So you can feel that way . You have to take the bad the corset - so why not take some pleasure in the good , as you see it the petticoats ? We manage . " <p> " Ar-are you going to tell Gram how I feel ? " <p> " No , sweetheart , " said Francine . If we tell her about how you like petticoats , then shell just find another punishment and , if we tell her about how you detest your stays , well , shell make it worse somehow . " <p> " Couldnt be worse than this geez ! " <p> " Trust me , it could be worse smaller dresses have smaller waists . Smaller waists " The girls looked each other . <p> " You mean tighter ? " <p> " Possibly . But more likely , she would , punish you with more and harsher whippings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Martha , " Let 's cheer up and go to lunch . Come - Let me help you with your shoes . " <p> " Yes , let us put on your shoes , and we can go down to lunch , " agreed Francine . <p> <p> As the sisters entered the door , they turned and watched Patty follow them in . Momma , Poppa , Gram , and the other two Ryan brothers were sitting down already , waiting to be served by Cook . <p> Poppa looked at Patty cursorily , without surprise and then said , dryly , " I see Gram has been at work againsit down , my girl ( a little smile ) we are ready for prayers . You may have the honor . " <p> " Hello , Father . Hello Mother . Hello Grandmother . Hello Harold . Hello Sean . " Each nodded in return . The boys were prohibited from using their usual familiar names for the adults ( such as Poppa ) when dressed as a girl . It was Grams idea of propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must feel . <p> Mother said , " Make sure you tuck your skirts under like a young lady , dear . " She always said this when she saw one of the boys in a frock sitting down , for it was one of Grams sore points ( she had a many such points ) , and she did n't  want to see the boys suffer any more than they already were . <p> " Yes , Mother , " as she gathered her petticoats and the dress under her arms and stiffly sat . Even though her stays were hurting her , she smiled at Mother , knowing she meant well . Gram cast a sharp glance at Mother , as usual . <p> Father just sat there , observing , his mind regressing to his youth , when Gram put HIM through similar rigors . Well , hell be all right I am . Perhaps he was , but there came times , now and then , when he asked Mother to dress him up , usually when one was at home . Father particularly enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked corsets ! But , of course , he would never admit such to any of his handsome sons or pretty daughters . He let out a deep sigh as he folded his hands for prayer . <p> " Just for that , you will speak in a girlish voice for the rest of the evening . Do you understand , Patty ? " <p> More embarrassment . " Yes , Grandmother , dear , " Patty said in a high-pitched voice . " The younger girls giggled and they all looked down . <p> Patty squirmed in his chair and began to eat . But even the small portion she was given was difficult to get all down , her stays were so tight . She felt a bit nauseous , but managed to conceal it . <p> But Francine noticed her discomfort , and whispered , " If you eat slower , it will be easier on you . Girls always eat slowly . " <p> Patty glanced at her and smiled in gratitude , not only for the advice , but also more for the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed her aching waist again . <p> " Patty , young ladies do not continually touch their waists , " said Gram . " Desist ! " <p> " Yes , Grandmother , " in her high voice . <p> Dinner proceeded fairly normally after that , with the usual talk of family affairs and situations , and soon Patty , was immersed in talk , almost forgetting her tight stays . Her demeanor actually changed because of her attire she was more delicate , more feminine . It was almost second nature to emulate the mannerisms of her sisters she had observed all of these years , and the high-pitched voice , while initially annoying to use , soon became second-nature . Except for her stays , Patty actually was becoming comfortable being a girl . Most of her sisters seemed to notice that , but , most importantly , Mother did as well , lovingly smiling a bit at her new daughters attempts at being lady . <p> So when Patty unconsciously began to rub her waist again , Mother immediately attracted attention to herself and began talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distract her attention from Pattys movements . Patty quickly realized she was doing , and even Mothers kind distraction , and smiled at her . Seems people around here treat me better as a girl than boy ! <p> Dinner over , the family retired to the parlor , some playing games and others reading . Patty was required to learn crocheting from Delilah , who was adept at the craft . She still wished she could have her laces loosened a bit , but knew that there was no way , even if Gram allowed it the dress would never close ! So she suffered as she learned , concentrating on the pleasant feel of her petticoats whenever her sides ached , really bothering her . Many of her thoughts were of the difficult day ahead at school . <p> Bedtime proved a little relief , as her stays were changed to the nighttime-type , a little looser , but also much longer . These stays were to her lower thighs another one of Grams requirements for ALL the girls . No touching of private parts ! Masturbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their hands were tied to the bed railings at night if she suspected they were abusing themselves . It was a common occurrence . <p> The one thing she did n't  like much was the light glacT dressing mask on her face to prevent the wiping off of the facial cream she had to sleep with . All the girls wore them . It was not tight , just annoying , it did have eyeholes , and a mouth and nose hole as well . <p> Patty DID enjoy the filly flannel nightgown it reminded her of a petticoat ! Just before they all said their prayers and went to sleep , Mother came up to say good night . <p> When she came to Pattys bed , she brushed her hand over her hair and , with a loving smile , whispered , " You would make a WONDERFUL daughter , dear ! " With that she kissed on the forehead and began to walk away . <p> " ButI still want to be a son , " he said in his male voice . <p> Mother looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Patty was full of confused thoughts , but eventually fell into deep sleep . She dreamt of a picnic on a blanket on a meadow , with fluffy clouds and lacy dolls and cozy petticoats . <p> <p> Patty was all ready for school and on her way out , when Gram came from behind and said , " Do n't  forget your bonnet , Patty ! " <p> " But I already have on a hat , Grandmother . " It was lacy and pinned close to her head . <p> " Oh ! No ! That is for inside ! Here . " She fitted a large straw bonnet on Pattys head , fussing to get it just right . Patty hated these bonnets , for they stuck out from the front of her face ( as was the fashion ) and prevented her from any peripheral vision . Difficult thing when you were trying to make sure some boy was n't sneaking up on you to lift your skirts , as they were wont to do ( shed done it herself ! ) . <p> Bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and the bonnet would surely attract even harsher derision and taunting from the boys , even her best friends . <p> Today again her stays hurt , but not as badly . She supposed she was getting used to the pressure . <p> " Good bye , Grandmother . " <p> " Have a pleasant day , dear . " <p> Right . This will certainly be a pleasant day . " Yes , Grandmother . " <p> The school was used to Grams manner of discipline , and , over the years tolerated it , so the teacher and other adults would really not take notice . <p> But children can be cruel , especially when a boy is dressed as a girl , so Patty was prepared for the worst . She did n't  even have to get to school before it began . Halfway there , Billy Murdock and Hans Miller saw her walking alone . <p> " Hows the sissy-boy ? " As a boy , Patty had a reputation of being a good fighter , so the taunting probably would never be really harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can we see your underwear ? " Patty ignored them , until one of them quickly ran up and pulled up her skirts . With the three petticoats , it was not difficult to preserve her modesty , but it WAS annoying . Darn bonnet ! <p> " Hows your pecker , Patty ? " They both laughed . <p> But it was only when some of the girls from schools , turned in from a side street , that the boys relented , and drifted off . <p> " Hello Patty , " they said quietly . Word apparently had gotten around about her plight . By their tone , Patty guessed that her sisters had asked them to be nice and understanding and try to protect her , since they did not go to the same school , being older . " We can walk with you , if you like , " said a pretty one named Jane . <p> " Y-yes , that would be nice . Thank you . " <p> " Thats a pretty dress , Patty , " said another , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension on Pattys face , she added , " Oh ! I really mean it . I 'm not being funny . It IS a pretty dress . And the lace " <p> Patty looked down . " Thank you . " Patty liked Glenda , so this was difficult , but they were being nice . <p> Glenda continued as they walked , softly , " Is this punishment hard for you , poor boy ? I mean , you must feel soawful . " <p> " Its not so bad . Its just " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Its just these darn stays - they are so tight ! " <p> " Now you know what we girls go through . But you will grow accustomed them , " said Jane . <p> " Pat , we will help you ward off those awful boys . Just stay with us , " said Glenda . " And I know Mary and Millie in your class we shall explain the situation to them , and they can do the same ! What a pretty bonnet ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad after all . The girls helped her with her studies , and that was positive . Patty got a lot of stares and many looks and comments from many of her old friends , but they dared not touch her or her clothing , which reduced the agony considerably . Her new friends also warned her when , because she was not quite used to looking after them , her petticoats showed too much , or she was just not quite lady-like in her manners ( It was rumored that some of the teachers actually reported back to Gram any indiscretions ) . <p> Mary and Mille were very close friends and , after a day with Patty in her predicament , got to know her and rather like her , and invited her over to Marys house after school the next day . <p> It did n't  take long for the four girls and Patty to become good friends , and soon they were talking about exchanging clothes and the like it made Patty very excited . Later her sisters joined them now and then . Unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could not use Marys clothing in order to allow for larger stays . Gram would notice the new dresses . So Patty continued with her struggle , finding solace in some of the stories the girls told her of THEIR past difficulties with tight stays . <p> Soon , the Pattys period drew to a close , and once more , he found himself in boys clothing . Then , somehow , the closeness that had developed with these new found female friend slowly vanished . The assumption has to be made that , whilst dressed male , Pat could not confide in them , or act feminine , and therefore , alienated the girls a bit , making them feel uncomfortable . This soon dawned on Patrick . One thing was for certain : Pat enjoyed his time with the boys less and less , partly because he had reveled so in his time with the girls , and also because the boys began treating differently , not as friendly . Perhaps they were somehow intimidated - or confused . Or perhaps they had less and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the petticoats ! He was relieved that he did not have to wear stays any longerbut it appeared to be a reasonable trade-off . <p> So , somehow , in a few days , Patrick did n't  hesitate as he trampled Grams prize flowerbed , visions of soft petticoats and friendships in his mind . <p> As time went on , it was noticed that PATRICK was always bad , PATTY was always good . And little by little there was less and less of the former , and more and more of the latter , happily learning the ins and outs of lacing her waist tight from her friends .

" <p> " Why a proper little flowergirl 's dress , with two huge petticoats , ruffled panties , your fancy kind , of course , some lace knee-hi 's , another pair of Mary-Janes , and a blonde wig set in banana curls with pink ribbon bows decorating it-and of course all the clothes should be in pink and white with all kinds of ribbons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't bother to argue or complain as Ms.Susan led me off to the dressing room , for I knew in my heart of hearts it would do no good . " Now you wait here , little girl , and soon Ms. Susan will turn you into the little Sweet Heather that Mommie wants you to be ! " Ms. Susan was back in no time at all , and soon had me stepping into a pair of pink and white lace-covered panties , a pink flared skirt , a white blouse with pink lace on the collar and cuffs and was putting a blonde pageboy wig on my head . " Sweet Heather , you look just good enough to eat , and I just might do that ! " laughed Ms. Susan . " Now let 's go see Mommie ! " <p> When we reached the front of the store , Mommie did n't stop laughing for five minutes . " Oh ! This is just to good to be true ! I 've just got to take you to my beauty shop appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me carrying my purse in one hand , looking like the sweet little girl she was turning me into , with my skirt blowing in the breeze and showing my ruffled panties underneath , much to the delight of the ladies watching from Ms. Susan 's . She led me to the passenger 's side of the car and buckled me in with my arms at my side so I could n't get away . <p> " Now , my little girl , I 'm going to take you for a little ride , and when we get there , you 'll be at a place that all little girls love to go . But you 'll have to be a good little girl when we get there or Mommie will spank your little tushie . " <p> We drove off , heading for the other side of town , and , after driving for about twenty minutes , arrived at our final destination : " The Pink Powder Puff Beauty Shop " , the sign said . <p> " Mommie , you 're not taking me in there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you could stay in the car , letting everyone see you , and laughing . Then I could bring all my girlfriends out to see the pretty little sissy I have sitting out here . Or , you could come in with me and be introduced as my niece Sweet Heather . It 's all up to you , and remember , that act has just gotten you that much closer to a spanking . <p> " Mommie , please do n't spank Sweet Heather . I 'll come with you ! " She reached into the car and undid my seatbelt , once again freeing my hands , and proceeded to help me out of the car , walking with me into the beauty shop . <p> " Girls , are you ready for my appointment , and my misbehaving son 's , too ? " And , with that , my long brown hair came into view , along with the deep crimson blush on my cheeks . <p> " My goodness ! It 's a little boy , but dressed in such darling clothes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so his appearance matches his dress ! " laughed one of the girls . <p> " Now what do you want us to do with him ? " <p> " Well , as you all can see , he 's not the little blonde that I brought in here with me , so I think you 'll need to bleach his hair , and I suppose that a perm would also be in order , a manicure , pedicure , pink nail polish , of course , and , when you set his hair , leave it in rollers . That way he gets the same joy we all do sleeping on rollers all night . Sharon , if you can open early in the morning , I 'll have him over here so you can comb him out and put his make-up on before the wedding . <p> " Now , little boy , go with your beautician so she can get you all prettied up ! " <p> " But , Mommie , do I have to ? " I asked <p> " You did n't ask that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while your father and I were away , now did you ? This is your punishment for that . Now take it like the little sissy girl you are ! " <p> And so , with that being said , I followed the beauty operator off to my date with destiny . " <p> **** <p> The beauty operator , whose name I learned was Allison , escorted me to the back of the shop and had me take a seat by the shampoo bowl . <p> " My , what a pretty little sissy girl we have here ! But I 'm going to make you prettier still ! Now let 's get your hair washed and see what we have to work with ? " As Allison shampooed my hair , I knew that the jig was up . Mommie finally caught me in her clothes , and now was time to suffer Well , I had always wanted to be a girl , or so I told myself , but who was I kidding ? This was not the way to spend a Saturday afternoon . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , Sweet Heather . It 's time for our little girl to get curly . " So she set my hair in perm rods , put in the solution , and Sweet Heather became a little curly head . Allison neutralized me then set my hair in rollers and put me under the dryer for my hair to curl . <p> " Your Mommie wanted me to bleach your hair blonde and that 's just what I 'm going to do after you 're done drying , and just think , little girl , tonight , Sweet Heather is going to spend her first night sleeping in a baby doll with her hair up in rollers . Wo n't we be having sweet dreams ! " <p> " Mary , Sweet Heather is waiting for you ! Mary ! Sweet Heather 's Mommie wants you to do her nails in a sweet shade of pink . And be sure that she gets both a manicure AND a pedicure . " <p> " Heather , you stay with Mary now , and do n't you move an inch ! Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misbehave ! " <p> " Yes , Miss Allison . I 'll be right here when you get back . " <p> One thing one learns in a beauty shop is that time passes slowly , but soon Miss Allison was back at my side again . " My ! What pretty nails my little darling has ! Such a pretty pink ! And if she 's been a good little girl I might just have a surprise for her . " <p> " Has she been a good girl Mary ? " <p> " Oh ! She 's been just a little angel , Allison . " <p> " Well , guess what little girl ! Your hair does n't get bleached today . I told her that would be too much for one day . But do n't worry darling , she promised to bring you back next Saturday for your bleach , and a facial after . You 'll need it after wearing make-up all week long . And do n't think that once you have a perm that does n't let you stop taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me what going to bed in rollers for a full week is like , and I wo n't be here tomorrow when you come in for your combout and makeup , so have fun ! when you come back . " <p> It was the next morning when Mommie called me to get out of bed . " Hey , get up , Sweet Heather ! It 's time for your bath ! Time 's awasting , and your going to have a very big day . We have to get you a bath , dressed up , and down to the beauty shop before we go to the wedding . For now , you 're going to wear the same outfit you wore to the shop yesterday . Now , get your sissy butt in here . " <p> I entered the bathroom to find Mommie standing there with a bottle of some kind of creamy stuff in her hand . " And how come we have n't gotten our babydoll 's off yet , young lady ? You 're being expected to be treated like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , you 're looking a bit like one ! " laughed Mommie . " So hold up your hands ' cause they 're coming off . " <p> So I held up my hands and Mommie got rid of my babydolls . She started spreading the lotion all over my body as I asked , " What 's this stuff for Mommie ? It 's burning me all over ? " <p> " Why , Sweet Heather , you should know it 's depilatory cream . It 's what keeps us girls nice and smooth all over , and , when it gets done working on you your going to be smooth as a baby 's butt ! " laughed Mommie . With that . she started running the tub , adding bubble bath and a fragrant bath oil . " This is to make Sweet Heather smell just like the sweet little girl I 'm turning her into . In fact , because your hair did n't get bleached yesterday , remember , you still have an appointment with Anne Saturday after , and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out ! " laughed Mommie . " Now , get out of the tub so I can dry you off ! " <p> I got out of the tub and Mommie dried me off with a towel , then powdered my body with a scented dusting powder that tickled as she applied it to my skin . " Hurry , little girl , and get your clothes on . We should have been at the beauty shop five minutes ago ! " yelled Mommie . <p> I hurried as fast as I could , but it was n't fast enough for Mommie . I think it was all the big rollers in my hair . It was hard getting them over the dress . Five minutes later , we were at the beauty shop and , as we pulled up , all the girls came out to greet us . <p> " Sweet Heather 's cousin just got here with the dress and all the other things you asked her to bring , so just go back to the dressing room , and we 'll get her all dolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I followed Mommie back to the dressing room , where Cathy was waiting for us . Get undressed , little girl . We have all kinds of new clothes for you to wear ! " said Cathy . <p> I got undressed and hopped up on the table , lying on my back . Mommie was across the room from me with her back turned . When she turned around , my jaw dropped . For , in her hands were a bottle of baby oil , and a can of baby powder . " You 've acted like a baby all morning , so I though that we 'd just treat you like one . " Mommie oiled , then powdered me , and Cathy came around with the thickest pair of diapers I had ever seen . When they put them on me , I could hardly close my legs . Then Mommie was there with a pair of pink and white ruffled rumba panties which , she drew up my legs . After that , Cathy was there carrying three petticoats ; two were white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net and also very full . She put them on me and , when I turned around , I looked like a powder puff on legs . <p> But Mommie was n't done with me yet for now . She was back with a cotton candy pink satin party dress that , when she had put it on me , the result was simply too pretty for words . It was pink satin with white ruffles round the collar and round the puff sleeves . It had a white ruffled bib with three pink bows decorating it and pink bows on each of the sleeves . Then Mommie made me lean back against the table . " When your wearing knee-hi 's with pink ruffles around the the tops and a pair of pink patent Mary-Jane 's on my feet . She then had me turn around and tied the sash around my waist into a big bow . <p> " O.K. , Sweet Heather ! It 's time to go up front for your comb-out and make-up now--and try to be careful ! I know it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed Mommie . I know , because I made it that way . <p> Well , Mommie had to stand behind and push in order to get me to the front , and when the girls saw me , it took them at least fifteen minutes to stop laughing . <p> " Now come here little girl , and we 'll get you combed-out ! ' laughed Allison When she finished , my hair was all done up in barrel curls , with pink and white ribbon bows in it . My cheeks were tinged with pink blusher , and my lips pink with lipstick . We were ready to be off to the wedding . <p> " Sorry girls , but this day at the beauty shop has got Sweet Heather all tired out , and she 's got to take a little nappy-poo . Night , Night ! " <p> **** <p> As I stood there in the lobby of the beauty shop , I wondered why did I do something so stupid ! There I was , wearing a frilly lace encrusted dress , my petticoats fluffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in barrel curls with each one with a little pink or white bow attached to it . My face was made-up , and my fingers and toes sported nail polish . <p> " Come , you sweet little sissy ! It 's time for you to become a star ! " laughed Mommie . " Our limo is here . " <p> I looked up and sure enough , pulling into the parking lot was a shining pink limo . " But Mommie , I ca n't go in that ! Everyone will think I 'm a Sissy ! " I pleaded . <p> " Now look at you . There you go , standing there in a pink dress with your petticoats fluffing out and you have the nerve to tell me that someone will call you a sissy -- I should spank your fanny right now ! Do n't you think that is the point of our little adventure today ? Now get into the limo . " <p> We got into the car and drove off to the wedding . As we traveled , Mommie turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the main reason that I 'm taking your cousin 's wedding is to humiliate you as much as possible , and that I want to convince you to never wear a dress again ! When we get there , you 're to be on your best little girl behavior , and if your cousins give you a hard time you do n't fight back , but turn around , drop a sweet little curtsy , and thank then for caring ! " giggled Mommie . " Any behavior other than that will involve a longer time in dresses ! " <p> When we pulled up to the steps of the church , the wedding was being held at , my cousin and her maids-of-honor were awaiting up with smiles on their faces . Mommie got out to greet them and came to my side of the car to let me out . " Come little sissy it 's time for your big day ! " she giggled . <p> I got out and was immediately surrounded by girls . " My gosh ! Any girl in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That dress is just too beautiful for words ! " <p> " And it must be held out by at least three petticoats ! " laughed one of the maids-of-honor . I wonder what he 's wearing under it . " <p> " Let 's see ! " giggled still another girl , grabbing my dress from the rear and holding it up . " Come girls , you 're not going to believe this ! " my cousin shouted . " He 's wearing pink and white rumba panties and I think he has something inside them ! Oh ! Is n't this just the cutest ! She 's got the little doll wrapped in diapers ! " giggled my cousin . <p> " Why did you do this Auntie ? " <p> " Well I know that little girls and little sissies sometimes get all excited , and I did n't want him to ruin his dress . After all , we know how little girls just want to keep their pretty dresses ! " laughed Mommie . <p> " O.K. little girl . It 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , so let 's get in the church . " <p> When we got in the church , my cousin was already waiting and , as I came up to her , she handed me a white wicker flower basket , filled to the top with pink rose petals . " Now , these are your instructions ! You 'll be at the front of the line , and , as you take a step , I want you to bend at the waist and sprinkle some flower petals , and I want you to do that at every step you take ! " <p> " But , cousin , wo n't my panties show every time I step ? " I asked . <p> " Oh ! Most certainly , but your mommie wants you as humiliated as possible , and it 's my wedding , so you 'll do exactly as I say , or your mommie is going to be giving you more time in dresses to think about it ! " <p> Til then , that was the longest walk of my life , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not through with me yet . Later in the day , at the reception , I was playing with some younger cousins of mine , or should I say they were playing with me , lifting my skirts and teasing me about the diapers I was wearing . So I took a swing and hit one of them . Well , the adults broke it up , and , the next thing I knew , I was standing before Mommie . <p> " I just ca n't get over it ! Your Mommie gets you all fixed up just like a sissy like you like to be , then you just have to go and ruin it . Well , young man , since you keep acting like this , I 'm just going to have to add to your time in dresses one year . That , and a good old fashion spanking when we get home . But that wo n't humiliate you enough , so I 've got another idea ! " laughed Mommie . <p> " Girls , you remember the chocolate mousse that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then give it to your mom and tell her I need it thickened with some flour , and when she 's finished , bring it here . And you might bring her along . She might enjoy watching me punish this little sissy ! " <p> " Now , little sissy , off with those rumba panties ! I have a special pair for you to wear ! " <p> I took them off , and Mommie reached into her purse and brought a pair of clear vinyl panties with a chain around the waist . I put them on . <p> " Now girls , I want two of you to go behind him and hold his dress and petticoats up . " <p> Two girls moved behind me and did that . Then Mommie asked two girls to pull my diapers out so you could see skin . <p> " Now , you 're the little girl he hit . I 've got a special job for you . I want you to take a third of the mixture and put it down the back of her diaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and then hold it a minute . " <p> They did that , and it felt yucky . Then Mommie was there with a little lock . <p> " Guess what ? When I thread this lock , you wo n't be able to take off those diapers , or that panty til I get ready to take them off you , and you have n't lived until you sit down in them -- and with those clear panties on , everyone is going to see what you 've done . " <p> " Now girls , you can let his skirts down . I want you to get in on the fun too . First , I want one of you to take a little in her hand and smear it around sissy 's face . Make it look like he just got done feeding himself . " <p> " Now , let 's see , what can we do with the rest of this ? " <p> " I 've got an idea Sis ! " She came up and whispered it in Mommie 's ear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sis ! " And with that she handed the bowl to me . <p> " Now little sissy , unless you want to get spanked twice as hard as your going to now , you 'll take that bowl , raise it over your head , and pour it on your head . " <p> I had no choice , and as I lifted the bowl up , the girls came behind me with a chair and sat me down . <p> Well , I went home that night with my diapers still on , and received the spanking of my life . If it helped my disposition any we 'll never know , but it did n't stop me from being the little girl I wanted to be or end my ability to get in trouble .

I was still home for Christmas break from school , and as usual was playing with my older sister ( age 13 ) and my younger sister ( age 4 ) as we always did under my oldest sister 's leading and direction : she was the school teacher and we ( my younger sister and I ) were her female students , or she was the fashion designer and we were her female models , or she was the mother and we were the daughters , and these were always played with me in full girl 's clothing ( all stuff that used to be my older sister 's when she was younger , but were now stored by my mom in our basement in one of two large steamer trunks under the steps , or in one of three large garment bags that hung behind her sewing area ) ... I can not remember which make-believe game we were playing this day , but my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly remember the outfit because I so clearly remember being caught and embarrassed in it . <p> We had been in the basement for over an hour playing some make-believe dress-up game ... I was wearing pastel blue nylon panties , white stretch-lace tights , an off-white full slip ( stretch top/bodice that flared below the waist with a 1 " lace trim on the hem ) , a formal , ivory-satin Christmas party dress that had been hers when she was 8 or 9 ( it was smooth satin jumper style tank sleeves , zipped up the back to a hook behind my neck , satin sash-belt that snapped in back with a fixed bow , wide flair skirt from the waist down to 2 " below my knees and lined with 2 layers - one of taffeta lace and one of stiff netting - with sheer , see-through lace long-sleeves that had elastic at the wrists in a lacey ruffle ) , and black patent-leather buckle shoes ... I had fairly long hair for the mid- ' 60 's that completely covered my ears by 2 " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled both sides up into pigtails in rubber bands and tied white ribbons in bows on each pigtail , and had the bangs combed straight down with a part down the middle and a white plastic hairband across the top of the bangs where they met the part ...

I looked at my older sister as I entered the kitchen and she just smiled wide at me , and my younger sister just sat there at the table drinking her cocoa ... I knew the woman behind me was Mrs. Thomas ( my Sunday school teacher in 1st grade ) , and behind her was Mrs. Sarallano , who had n't really seen me face-to-face yet ( she was the children 's choir director and I sang for her ) , and behind her was Mrs ..

Sarallano got into the kitchen and said hi to sandy and then looked at me kind of perplexed , and asked , " So my sweet , what 's your name ? " ... I had no idea what to say , I mean this was the lady who was my choir director ... then Mrs .. Crossman came in and also said hi to Sandy and then looked over at Deanna and gave her a pat on the head , and then turned and also seemed not to know me right away and said , " Hello dear , and who 's this ?

" <p> Within a few seconds , Mrs .. sarallano and Mrs .. Crossman both got wide-eyed and smiled and said things like , " Oh my goodness , is that you Danny ? " and " My , oh my , I can not believe that 's you Danny . " Then Mrs ..

@@37517441 @6517441/ <p> There are quite a few videos posted on YouTube , etc. of retro fifties era fashions ( recreated ) , especially from Germany . While they are great to watch , somehow they do n't really capture the true feeling of the magic era . Firstly , the petticoats do not match the intricate designs of the true 1950 's creations . Secondly , one sees the models walking and flaunting the petticoats , something no young girl would have done in the 1950s . Those of us old enough to remember the magic era , recall that the whole charm and thrill would be a sudden glimpse of yards of frilly net and lace when a girl sat , or a sudden gust of wind revealing the delicious frilly confection a girl was wearing beneath that bouffant skirt . The exception to this rule would be the dance floor , but again , no girl would do a ' cancan ' , just give us guys the fleeting glimpse as she spun and twirled her skirt and petticoat out horizontally . Do others agree with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yesterday 's post reminded me that that is what my sister called hers : bouffant slips . They were NOT as huge as the square dance petticoats of today . I remember wash day and the old wringer washer . Mom used to use a porcelain-lined baby bath tub filled with a starched concoction , and my sister 's petticoats were the first to take a dip in there after the rinse tub . Then the white shirts . A resurgence , yes , a small one , or one geared around small people as well . Case in point , the pettiskirt craze . <p> 29 Nov 13 Chris S. <p> I was also lucky enough to live through this time but , in retrospect , I did n't appreciate just how lucky I was ! Petticoats were often referred to as ' bouffant ' slips to distinguish them from normal straight slips or petticoats - either full length or waist length . Ornamentation was the norm . Lace and ribbons . There has been what appears to have been a coordinated push in the past ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion .

In the 1950s and 60s women referred to ' petticoats ' or ' slips ' - both terms were freely used . I asked a girlfriend back in ( I think ) 1958 what she hoped to get for Christmas . Her answer : a ' sticky-out petticoat ' . She referred , of course , to the then-fashionable stiffened waist slips . In fact , our friendship was only a temporary affair and I never found out if she got one . She did , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dress ' to make it all flare out ' and she hoped she would be able to wear it later in the year under her school summer dress . There was some doubt about that because , apparently , the school tried to stop the girls from wearing the big net petticoats , but she thought the stiffened one she hoped to get would be allowed . <p> " I learned from another source that the multi-layered net petticoats were regarded as too bulky for school use , but the stiffened nylon ( paper nylon ) ones did a similar job but could be flattened down more easily , and so were easier to manage in the confines of the school classroom and corridor . " <p> ED : In English , " crinoline " is indeed a reference to horsehair and cage devices of the Victorian era ; however , in the US , it came to also be the term used for a stiff petticoat . In the UK , " crinoline " was never used to describe such . " Sticky out " is kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this with showing the petticoats is something imported from square dance , where it is as it should ? Here in the UK , ladies showing their petticoat were told ' Charlie is dead . ' It was so embarrassing to show the petticoat , the message was coded . My grandmother always asked my grandfather to have a check before they went out . It was not a petticoat , but a slip . <p> 27 Nov 13 Eleanore <p> As Crinolyn has stated , it was definitely a ' no no ' to show petticoats - I always remember my mother asking me to check the hem of her skirt or dress every time before leaving the house , to make sure that the hem was hiding her underclothes and that no petticoat lace was apparent . <p> " I was only five when she started to ask me to check . For a time I told her the truth , with subsequent adjustments made so that decorum was achieved ; however I found the whole idea of glimpses of lace petticoat so enchanting that , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing when in fact there was a glimpse of lace hem peeking below the hemline . I would then walk behind my mother while she was shopping , inhaling the delights of seeing glimpses of lace petticoat as she walked , or when her hem bounced , or when a breeze lifted her skirt . I never tired of watching for the next exposT and sadly would do so today but for the lack of petticoat hems to be seen . Oh well ! ! ! <p> 27 Nov 13 Geoff in Australia <p> G'day to all , I agree with all the comments re the display of petticoats . In the fifties and sixties the general rule was to have the skirt two inches longer that the petticoat/s . Just last week I saw the two opposites : One a young girl teenager , early twenties wearing a red floral dress with about two to three inches of black net showing below the hem . The other was magic . She stood out in the crowd a red dress well ' pouffed out ' and the occasional flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have dragged out my camera , but I was not quick enough to think of it .

Here they were always referred to as petticoats . Ahh ! Memories . <p> 26 Nov 13 Crinolyn <p> " Looking at this photo , it seems that there is a father and four daughters in school uniforms . They appear to be carrying lunches and books , maybe waiting for a school bus ? It is supposed to be from 1963 . <p> " True , they did NOT show petticoats .

" <p> 25 Nov 13 Denise <p> Seems like one of the big charms of petticoats in ' The Era ' was knowing they were there , but having to work to get a peek . Yep , the girls tried hard not to put their undies on display and we guys tried just as hard for a special treat : a little glimpse of white . " I do n't ever remember hearing the word petticoat or crinoline back in the 1950s . I recall my sister and cousin sometimes talking about their ' big slips ' or ' stiff slips , ' or ' cancans , ' but never petticoats or crinolines .

Oh , how I hated that ! <p> ED : We personally heard the term ' crinoline ' used a lot , more than ' petticoat , ' along with the other terms mentioned above now and then . In Britain , our understanding is that the term ' crinoline ' was never used . Correct us if we are wrong . <p> 24 Nov 13 Marilyn <p> I totally agree . Girls in the fifties went to considerable trouble to make sure the crinoline or petticoat was not visible . It was a source of embarrassment if the hem of the crinoline slipped below the hem of the skirt , requiring a rush to a washroom to make a repair . Safety pins and straight pins were used to anchor the undergarment so that it remained hidden . Yes , the joy came at school when there was a sudden , accidental flash of a frothy crinoline as a girl attempted to sit modestly at her desk , but had difficulty controlling the abundant pouf .

The same length or up to 1 " shorter is okay . <p> 2 : The petticoat must never be darker than the skirt . White works with everything , black only works with a black skirt .

I recognize that the pinball machines are actually from the 70s , but I can handle that minor dIscrepancy . The girls commonly try to look ' 50s ' , to the extent they can in this dress .

I had noticed one particular waitress on several previous visits . She had not been there long , and had what I 'd call a ' permanent frown ' ? almost at the verge of being unattractive , but with an underlying cuteness that made me glance at her every chance I got .

Then here comes Poopsie ( another waitress ) . She commonly wore a nice white frothy petticoat , so it was a pleasant surprise to see her . Someone came over with a glass of water , and informed me that someone ( else ) would be with me shortly .

She waved occasionally , but somehow I didn ? t seem to draw her section for several weeks . I surmised that perhaps the management had suggested that these things not be worn any more because of the inconvenience and size factor . I could understand management doing that ? which is not saying I agreed with it .

After a bit , my eyes just happened to be directed to just the right spot at just the right moment - she had her back to me , about 25 feet away ; she bent over forward ( away from me ) to pick up something off the floor , I think .

She was a wonderful mother - and one of the wealthiest women in Texas . <p> Our family was Texas royalty , according to her .

Little Mandy was n't shy at all . Nor was she very lady-like . Mom took great pains to explain to me that ladies just did n't  do that . <p> I was more subtle by age eleven .

I was also a blooming exhibitionist , but , so what ? I was Mandy McDougal . <p> I 'm sure Mom prayed for that phase to pass quickly . I do n't  think she ever learned of my playing doctor and other naughty games with my cousins and playmates of both sexes in secret ! <p> The local charities received a windfall of beautiful used childrens clothing every year , donated by the McDougal estate and written off on taxes .

@@37517453 @6517453/ <p> From my experience , it is very difficult to get a significant other ( especially a wife ) to appreciate the enjoyment that some men get from wearing petticoats . I 've been married twice and both wives did n't want me to cross-dress , let alone wear petticoats . During my first marriage , I often would put on her clothes when she was gone .

Costumes with crinolines may be rented , and you may thus avoid the hassle of arguing over a purchase .

Let him/her know that you are attracted , but again , do n't act like a wolf ! Be genteel . He or she is now the ' lady ' you 've longed for , remember ? More discussion might follow this event .

Do n't ruin an otherwise loving relationship over two or three bolts of stiff nylon net ! Remember , you always have your private time and your imagination - and this community - to fall back on !

The BEST part came when we got home : I would be so worked up from being around all those petticoats , and actually having women press up against me while wearing them , it 's a miracle my heart did n't burst out of my chest !

Yes , you have to go to class each week , but I ca n't think of many times when we 've had more FUN ! than in Square Dance class . Oh , do n't worry about the lessons . I never danced in my life until we started Square Dance class . Believe me , if you can walk , you Can ! Square Dance . The best part of course is ALL the Pretty Frou Frou . <p> If you have a support group that would like to try it you could even hold a dance where Everyone ! comes in Frou Frou . Even if you 've never done it before you 'll find that most callers are excellent at providing a really fun dance for first timers . Also , most callers would n't be upset or judgmental about being asked to call for a T group . 
@@37517454 @6517454/ <h> SKIRT TRAINING FUNDAMENTALS ( for adults ) <p> There are basically two types of skirts , and , in wearing them day in and day out , women must constantly be aware of the them , especially when pursuing certain activities . <p> Straight skirts , especially if of a longer length , are probably the most restrictive . Bending down , negotiating stairways , and sitting number among the many of those times when a woman is VERY aware , whether she likes it or not , that she is wearing a skirt , <p> It is mostly impossible for a lady to bend down at the waist to pick up something , as the tightness about her thighs and restricted ability to spread those thighs necessitates her keeping them tightly together and bending at the knees . With high heels on , this can take much practice , as balance is precarious . In this case , the skirt actually forces the action : There is very little else she can do in order to accomplish her task ! Of course , the more " pegged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight skirt is , the more difficulty she will encounter . <p> Heels also tend to hinder her ability to climb stairs . Combine a tight , straight skirt with high heels and , sometimes , the task may be impossible . Most ladies accomplish this by ascending the stairs in a " sideways " fashion . This technique works for descending stairs as well , a time which can prove to be very dangerous , since a large chance exists that she may trip up on those heels ! An ankle-length straight skirt makes the situation even more precarious . While most of these tend to have slits ( vents ) , some slits are not very long , and do not really make the job of climbing stairs easy . One wonders how ladies in the hobble skirt era managed stairs ( they were probably carried ! ) . <p> " Sideways " seems to be the key word when wearing a straight ( and tight ) skirt . Even sitting down requires this technique , especially if a couch is low and even more if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels really are an important part of the skirt management discussion , particularly since women usually wear them with straight skirts . As a result , it is imperative that all skirt management practice be done wearing at least 3 " ( and preferably 4 " ) heels . Without them , all is for naught . <p> If the straight skirt is very short , modesty becomes a consideration . When short skirts are tight , they tend to ride up with body movement . Therefore , it is imperative that a lady continually pull the skirt down , in order to keep her crotch covered . Stretching up is another activity that should be avoided when wearing any short skirt . Awareness is something ladies always must practice when wearing such garments . Then , that provides for an aura of femininity in the manner in which she walks , sits and otherwise negotiates her way through the day . The helplessness and hindrance engendered by straight skirts certainly adds to her attractiveness . <p> One last note : Although many do not wear slips with tight skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slip with the slit in the skirt , so as to be congruent . A man will appreciate the time a lady spends making this effort , and certainly the sloppy look of a non-slitted slip blanking out the slit in a skirt presents a very careless look . <p> Full skirts ( bouffants ) present a whole other set of considerations . Nothing is so feminine , and nothing else has the potential for indignity . Here , too , a lady must keep on constant guard . <p> Sitting is the largest consideration : There are essentially two ways a lady may accomplish this . One way is to smooth her skirts under her buttocks as she descends into sitting position . At the same time , she must be certain that the front part of her skirt is not billowing upwards so much as to compromise her modesty . All the while , if the skirt length is longer , she must make sure that the back part does not sweep the floor and muss her skirt and petticoats ! This is very difficult if carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause much consternation on the part of said female . The term " petticoat face " is used to describe the look on a lady ? s face when attempting to navigate such a procedure . When she fails , we may coin the term " red petticoat face ! " ( See the 1954 New York Times Magazine article on the subject , printed here in its entirety . ) <p> The other way is for the lady to allow the back fullness to come up behind her , generally reducing the upswell on the front part of the skirt . The result is that there is nothing but panties between the lady and the seat . Could be a chilling ( or unsanitary ) prospect . It is , however , a delightful sight when the lady is sitting on the ground with her skirts about her ! Of course , in such instance , her skirts must be perfectly arranged , special , attention given to the petticoats underneath ! <p> During all of this , the petticoats and crinolines underneath tend to get mussed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her underskirts at every possible moment , for the proper peeking out from under requires they be neat and seemly . The best way is for girlfriends to mutually inspect the two sets . Of course , the more layers , the more inspection and maintenance will be required . This allows careful arrangement of the layers , so that one is not hung up on another ; and , of course , any ornamentation and frillies ( ribbons and bows ) applied on the slips must also be kept from creasing . <p> Another consideration is care in keeping your heels untangled from the petticoats , especially if the petticoats are made of net or other fragile material .. This is most important when the skirt length is longer , as then it tends to happen more often , especially when sitting . A ripped petticoat is a poor sight to see ! <p> In order to help prevent that from happening ( and to protect their modesty ) , many ladies in the Fifties wore a straight slip underneath their bouffant lovelies . If this is done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding double consideration . See the old " Lawrence Welk " shows--this arrangement was consistently used by his dancers . ( Probably made dancing more difficult ) <p> Floor and ankle-length full skirts present another set of problems . Aside from the consideration of touching others with your skirts ( improper ) , there is the safety situation . Tripping over one ? s skirts can cause injury , to say nothing of embarrassment . Of course , touching another with your skirts can be provocative as well , and lead to nicer things . Skirt-flirting is an art , short OR long and , as such , is a fit topic for another article . There is , however , very little more feminine then the grace of an accomplished long-skirt wearer . <p> Some such skirts are draped over hoops . Hoops can be amusing , even to the wearer , but they require a specific technique in order that the whole rig doesn ? t fly up in the air upon sitting down . This is accomplished by assuring that the rear part is pulled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including hoops , be pulled up in front so the possibility of tripping is negated . Coming down stairs requires at least one hand on the railing and the other holding up the front part of the skirt . We assume that anyone behind you would be careful not to step on the backside of the skirt . In the case of a hoop , try to pull it up far enough so that you can see your trajectory , if not your feet . Of course , the width of a hoopskirt and its rigidity can cause damage to items sitting on furniture , to say nothing of little children and dogs ( which may take offense and begin crying or barking , respectively ) . <p> Hoops should be worn with either pantaloons , pettipants or petticoats underneath , again to protect modesty , especially when dancing . <p> Some long skirts , particularly wedding gowns , incorporate trains . Like the tractor-trailer driver and his trailer , a lady must be aware that it is behind her at all times , short OR long . Magnificent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand must be free in order to pull the whole train up off the floor in many instances . It is a treacherous time , wearing a train , during which a lady is dependent upon the care and concern of all around her . Perhaps that is why brides have trains , in order to emphasis their helplessness and dependency . <p> Remember that petticoats and crinolines are at their best when providing a provocative atmosphere . Arrangement of such at appropriate times can prove to be very erotic , and the rustle of taffeta and other petticoats is a sound not easily ignored . Wear more than one , so they can slide against each other , supplying a variety of interesting sounds . <p> While all these suggestions may be heeded , nothing woks as well as practice . So get into your heels , don that favorite pretty dress and get to work ! You ? ll feel the better for it ! 
@@37517455 @6517455/ <p> I have always been a sissy : I was petticoated as a child , my hair kept long and was required to wear girl 's knickers and a petticoat under my kilt on Sundays , which developed into regularly wearing skirts and dresses at home . However , my fondest memory is of going for a Valentine 's weekend to Dubai to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary . <p> My wife convinced me to wear my Sunday best to travel , which was a ladies ' kilt , under which , as with normal practice , I wore a full satin slip and matching knickers . My dear wife had bought me a lemon satin bra-slip which was underwired - for those of us with excess fat in the breast area it gives a rather feminine look to the chest , with undisguised breast mounds . This was worn with white knee-length socks and normal buckled slip-on shoes and a soft lemon lambs wool top which hid my slip straps if I was careful , and a black ladies shoulder bag . <p> It 's amazing just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few knowing looks , but most was only curiosity until I got to the security search .

With me almost shaking with fear ( or anticipation ! ) , his hands went up under my sweater and you could see his eyes get wider as he slid them up the satin material and onto the cups which shaped my rather well developed excess male breasts . <p> He completely disarmed the situation by asking if I was travelling as a man or a woman , and after I flustered with , " My passport says male , temporarily . " <p> " It 's OK sir , " came the reply , " I 'm sure it was always a mistake .

The young lady approached our seats and she pulled out two ladies ' complimentary sets handing them to the Nigerian lady and my wife , then was handing me a male gift set when the Nigerian lady grabbed her arm and told her that a ladies gift set would be more appropriate for me . The Stewardess looked at me and asked me if that was indeed my preference . With a red face I , of course , said " yes please " . <p> For those of you who know the flight , it takes almost seven hours ; I had to put up with tricks from this woman , including ordering ladies , magazines , a rather feminine cocktail and make-up from duty free , all delivered to me .

For those of us who live this way , of course , it can be an occupational hazard to be singled out for humiliation at the hands of others , but on a plane there is no escape from your audience . <p> Having finally dropped off to sleep , her final trick was to undo the rose clasp pin holding my kilt in place as a skirt and to slightly move the neck line of my sweater . This , according to my wife , who was highly amused by all this , had the joint effect of revealing a satin strap and a few inches of lemon lace . Next thing I know she was asking me to let her out for the toilet , at which time my additional movement revealed my bra-cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me my petti was showing . <p> I do n't suppose most will think it mattered by then - I was very androgynous in appearance anyway , and in essence my femininity exposed prior to this , but I had not yet reached the point in my life where it became second nature to wear feminine clothing in public , even if I rarely wore trousers at home . As we queued to get off she was behind me , deliberately rubbing her hand on my rear and giving it the occasional squeeze . <p> In comparison , the weekend was event-free . I got a rather knowing smile from the security lady in her burka , I wore my kilt on a couple of occasions while out without incident , and the only other thing that happened was a trick by my wife by the pool side .

Thelma ( my stepmother ) , and the Sandfords , placed shopping bags on the floor and she explained the dress code . I knew this had been coming ever since word spread about how perfectly I had behaved for a week after the birthday party where I 'd spent the whole time dressed as a girl , as punishment .

If we need to take him out in public , anyone who 's curious will have to get a close look and ask him what 's going on . And Preston will have to explain why such a clean-cut boy must wear such pretty girly-girl clothes .

If I wanted to watch television in the living room before my homework was done , it would be in a dressrisking being seen by any and all visitors . These were all incentives to do my chores and homework very promptly , and correctlywhich I had always been terrible at . <p> I was told that thisunlike what happened to me at the birthday partywas not petticoat punishment , because I had not yet done anything to be punished for .

" <p> I have to admit , they had my number . They knew that petticoating me was effective at killing my boy ego . They even knew that , like many boys , I lived in fear of being seen in my underwear , even of other boys seeing the waistband of my briefs . That was why the dresses were so indecently short . They knew I was naturally modest that is why they liked keeping me bare-legged , bare-armed , and gosh , this sleeveless dress even kept my shoulders bare ! I felt not only girlishly humiliated , but naked too , and so completely helpless . <p> The women started putting away the other shopping bags .

He did keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me from the party , and never told anyone about my predicament there . This had a price of course .

He even got me to blow him , which no boy wants to do , let alone kneeling in panties and petticoats ! While I was doing it , he loved to make comments like , " You suck a mean cock in your Jockey shorts , Preston , because I know you 're motivated to get your darn pants back .

Then came that awful day when I had to leave the house . <p> It was a rainy afternoon , and I was hours away from finishing my homework , when I noticed that my book report book was overdue . I absolutely had to renew it , but the library would close at five . I had to go now .

What are you doing ? ? " <p> " Can we discuss this in back ? " I pleaded . He led me to the back office , and on the way , the men reading newspapers in the periodicals section stared suspiciously at my bare legs and the pink hem . <p> " Take off your coat !

I begged him not to tell anyone . <p> " Well , I guess No , wait a minute . Let me tell Kevin Moore . " <p> I always used to torment Bobbys next-door neighbor , Kevin Moore , in the schoolyard , and once I had de-pants-ed him for calling me a stupid rich kid .

Now I had to submit and settle things peacefully on other peoples terms . I said , " OK . " Before I put the slicker back on to hurry out , Bobby insisted on coming close to reach under the dress and feel the lacy petticoats . He put both his hands underneath and felt them from behind , too , and I began to wonder if I had another Eddie to worry about . But he stepped back and said , " You better leave by the back door .

@@37517458 @6517458/ <h> EXTENDING THE CHARM <p> One admirer 's perspective on petticoats , crinolines , hoops and farthingales <p> Why are bulky skirts so intriguing ? Why do they continue to find a place in the female wardrobe , despite their unwieldiness ? What makes them so attractive ? <p> Well , one of the most obvious answers is silhouette : A wide skirt exaggerates the female figure , allowing for the illusion of a thinner waist , and a curvaceous-ness that defines femininity of form . <p> Mystery is another aspect . What ? s under there ? The skirt seduces us into a world in which few men participate . Beneath the surface lies a myriad of captivating items : petticoats , garters , suspenders , stockings , panties , garterbelts , long girdles , long corsets - and the fragrances bestowed upon her flower garden by the lady herself . How can one help but wonder and desire to see and explore ? <p> But the mere width of the garments seems to preclude our examining the contents further . So , we are stymied , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps this protection gives the lady the courage to further inflame his passions , she secure in the knowledge that any advances can be dealt with easily , and allowance for advance kept in proportion to her interest in the gentleman . A garment to control her libido , as well as that of the interloper . <p> But there is further dichotomy here : The strength endowed on womanhood by such garments is countered by the fact that they leave her " open-ended " and accessible . Accessible to the elements , such as wind and unfortunate stumble ; accessible to unwarranted intrusion by those with little regard for the social probity assumed above . This has been particularly true during times in our history when it was considered uncomely for a lady to cover her private areas , further discussed below . At one time , hoop crinolines and voluminous petticoats placed a lady ? s very well-being in immediate danger should her clothing catch fire , or should her hoop attach itself to a moving vehicle . <p> Recently , there existed a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ? rooms always had long lines , while men could zip in and out with very little wait .

Add to that the incredible project involved in undressing and redressing , along with the confining atmosphere of a facility stall , and one can well understand why ladies stayed in their seats during intermission .

Most women attended to their bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate little thereafter . An examination of historical copies of Playbill -type publications yields some affirmation of this situation : Almost every article was written to attract the female reader . <p> But wide skirts also helped in the personal activities of women during the hooped crinoline and farthingale eras : Anecdotal evidence suggests that there were instances of women attending lawn parties , and standing off to one side whilst urinating . No proper gentlemen would ever think a lady would do such a thing , but who would know ? It was a day when the wearing of wearing any type of " panty-ed " garment , including drawers , by women was proscribed ( " only a loose woman would wear pants ! " ) . All it took was a little practice , and the lady could avoid a trip to the outhouse , with its attendant uncleanness .

" It was men who pointed out possible medical deleterious effects of tightlacing and the dangers of wearing cages , which could either catch fire , or become caught in a passing vehicle or other moving object . These observations became fertile ground for cartoonists ? satirical lampooning of these fashions . <p> So it was women who begot these innovations , and , unlike some men of another era , we are forever grateful to them and their understanding of the effects of feminine attire on men . Generally , with exception , modern women do not have a clue regarding the seductiveness of petticoats and the like . Rather , many feel that the fewer the articles of clothing they wear , the more attractive they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the male ? s admiration of the naked female form to be a signal to disrobe , not realizing that mystery is what beguiles the average man . <p> Wide skirts , whether in the form of hoops , crinolines , farthingales or voluminous petticoats alone , are a direct barometer of the times . Skirts become paltry during times of war and unrest , not only because of the scarcity of material , but of the mood of the women , preoccupied with thinking about their men who are away , busying themselves in their support . No time for encumbrances . Witness the American Civil War : The bell-shaped Southern Belle lost her " pouf " for the interim . However , after almost every such period , there comes about a widening of the skirt . Recent examples include World War II ( Dior ) , the Korean conflict ( teenage rock-and-roll skirts and cocktail dress crinolines ) , and the Vietnam conflict ( bouffant evening dresses and gowns ) . Now that the Cold War is over , we see pouf returning , even if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large mass of excess lacing which resulted from tight lacing corsets in times gone by ? Well , many times , it was simply drawn through the eyelet which formed at the waistband of the petticoat where it fastened in the rear . There , this " ball of laces " provided a pleasant upswing of the silhouette at the rear , especially in times when bustles were not in vogue . <p> The crinoline hoop ( horsehair over a rigid frame ) was an innovation born of the fact that as many as seventy pounds of heavy petticoats were worn at one time to keep nineteenth century lades ? skirts propped . The hoop did , indeed , alleviate milady of such weight , but offered the disadvantages mentioned elsewhere in this piece . Soon , however , concern began to emerge concerning the untidy look of the " hoopline " under the skirt ? the outline of the hoop structure clearly seen from without . In response , many women began to wear one or two , or even three , petticoats OVER their crinoline cages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This added weight again , and reduced the effectiveness of the cage in reducing such . <p> One might think that " hooplines " were only a consideration during the last century ; that this was not a subject of discussion in modern history . The fact is , there was a short time in The Fifties when hoops were the rage , worn over crinolines and more crinolines . However , the term " crinoline " in the Eisenhower era , was differently defined . During this period , the term referred to a knee-length petticoat , usually made of stiff netting or some other such material ( even though horsehair was not unknown ) . In Europe , any skirt propped up by a crinoline was known as a " rock-n-roll " skirt , and the petticoat underneath was a " can-can slip . " Generally , a crinoline was never known by anything else but it ? s nineteenth century definition in parts of the world outside of the United States . <p> History does repeats itself ! It was considered improper amongst the teen-agers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their skirts to be seen . To eliminate these lines , they wore crinolines OVER the hoops , making the silhouette even wider ! This , of course , almost guaranteed that an observer would be treated to some wonderful glimpses of underskirt . This writer once beheld such a sight and it will remain embedded in mind forever , as an example of delightful overindulgence . The wearer veritably " floated " into the room , and the eyes of every male could not keep anywhere else ! A memory with a halo around it ! <p> ( pg 69 ) " There was a girl in my school--a real sosh--who always wore her hoopskirt with such aplomb . She 'd sashay down the aisles between the desks ( to sit with a boy ! in the eighth grade ! ) without it once ever flipping up . Not even the school bus was her undoing like it was for the rest of us " mere mortals . " And the ridge of her hoop never showed through her skirt either . Not showing the hoop line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hoop with layers of crinolines . She wore this very long and with real Capezios . " Ellen Ekman <p> ( pg 65 ) " In the fifth grade ( 1957 ) , full skirts hit . The fuller , the better . So we wore not one , not two , but three or more petticoats , starched stiff . When that was n't enough , we learned to wear a hoopskirt . I say learned because it took practice to learn to seat yourself without the hoop flying up in front of you . I remember my mother suggesting that I could wear just one petticoat . Could n't I see how much more graceful it looked , wearing just one ? Of course not . What was the point of wearing just one ? The fuller , the better .. " Lyn Messner <p> Fifties fashion designer Anne Fogarty , an icon of the era , was dubbed " Petticoat Queen " for her advocacy of the flared and bouffant skirt . In her book " Wife Dressing " ( 1959 ) , she relates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations . She came home one night after a long day to find him sound asleep , his head pressed against a large mound of petticoats as a result of rolling over . Apparently , she had been sorting them earlier , and had left them on part of the large bed ; he had fallen asleep on the other half . Upon hearing her , he awoke and greeted her , but only after exclaiming that he thought he had died and gone to heaven ! For , when his eyes opened in the fog of sudden awakening , he found himself immersed in a cloud-like atmosphere , soft and delicate , and totally out of touch with reality . ( Many present-day women think most men are too ! ) I think we can all relate to that ! <p> In conclusion , certain ladies , who , throughout The Fifties , very rarely could be found without their frou-frou , should be cited . These women understood the attractiveness of these wonderful undergarments , and how they enhanced their femininity . They were fortunate enough to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when existed many women who shunned crinolines and petticoats , preferring to wear their fuller skirts and dresses " sans petti . " <p> So , a broad salute to Alice Lon , Connie Stevens , June Allyson , Shelley Fabares , Patti Page , Grace Kelly , and Ann Sothern . They will live in our memories forever , symbols of what we all miss so much . In addition , a special honor goes to Wynona Judd , the contemporary country-and-western singer who never needed an excuse to wear her full crinolines on stage and elsewhere , whether considered fashionable at the time or not ! A bright and shining star . Too bad her daughter ( and duettist ) , Naomi Judd , chose not to follow in her foot-steps . A fallen star , in my book .

I did n't have a sister to blame I just found dresses and skirts pretty and exciting , particularly the 50s look , so much for films like Peggy Sue Got Married , etc. with their flashes of pettis , what a turn on . Anyway , I 'd acquired a couple of pettis , a full circle skirt and a full dress , together with various other items of lingerie and some other skirts , blouses and dresses . Fortunately , at 5 ' 5 " , I was n't too tall and I had a slight build ( only just 9ST ) so it was n't too hard getting things that fitted . I used to lock myself in my room , get changed and play on the computer . I 'd loosen up my long hair , and brush it out , trying to make it look nicer . I 'd get changed back if I had to go down to Mum &amp; Dad , and when I went to bed I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one a little baby doll ) . Carefully , I 'd put everything away in a case before I went out , so as not to be found out . <p> I was taking a year off before going to Uni and had arranged some work with a friend of Dad 's - Working on some software development for him in his small business . Before starting , I had to go for some training on the software . <p> I called home on the Thursday , as it seemed we 'd finish early , and I 'd get home about two on the Friday instead of later , as we 'd thought , so I thought I 'd let Mum know , as she was going to pick me up from the station . Well she was waiting at two when the train got in and we put my bag in the back of the car and headed home . On the way , she said I should be more careful with my things . I did n't know what she was talking about . Then she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . I realised what she meant . I mumbled . She said that if things needed washing , I should put them in the wash ; she did n't mean to pry , but they 'd taken the opportunity to re-decorate my room while I was away . As we arrived home , she asked how long I 'd been dressing up in girls ' clothes , I tried to answer , but the words did n't come out I was so embarrassed . <p> We went in , and I carried my bag through to the washing machine . <p> Mum called me upstairs . I was dreading this . I walked into my room : It was a pastel lemon color with satin bedspread and lace curtains . On the bed were two sets of clothes : jeans and sweatshirt with socks and shorts ; and the other the circular skirt with a white blouse , a petticoat and bra and pants . Mum looked at me told me I should have a quick shower , then get changed and join her downstairs . I could wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we 'd gather up all the girlish items and put them out as trash . If I chose the skirt , then there was to be no more hiding and I was n't to be ashamed of the way I was . <p> I showered , dried and went back into my room . I was determined I 'd have to get rid of my skirts . Once I looked at them on the bed , I knew I wanted another last time . I went to lock the door , but the lock had been removed . I pulled on the stockings and fastened them to the belt , pulled up the panties and then fastened the bra behind me . Mum had even laid out the silicon inserts I used . Next , I pulled up the petti , feeling it sway against my legs . Then I slipped on the blouse and buttoned it up . Finally , came the skirt , which fastened snuggly around my waist . It felt great . Next , I opened the wardrobe and there neatly hung up were my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers of the dressing table , I found my underskirts and panties neatly laid out . I turned around , and there was mum . <p> I think it must be like the feeling that a rabbit has when a predator is near : You simply freeze . I wanted to say , " Wait , I 'm going to change . " Instead , I went downstairs with Mum . <p> She told me I should unpack my bag and put the washing in the machine and get it started . I started loading the machine as she explained what I should do , and then she left me to it . When the machine started , I joined Mum in the kitchen . She sat me down and brushed my hair , then she applied some make up . It was really strange , but she said that if I was going to dress up , then I should do it right . She told me that while I 'd loaded the washing machine , she 'd called the salon and booked me in for the Saturday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beauty treatment . <p> Next I helped lay the table for our evening meal . Not the three places for Mum , Dad and me , but eight places , as we were to have company . Then I had to hang out the washing to dry . I went out into the back yard to hang out the washing ; while I was doing this , I realised mum was talking across the fence to a neighbor . At the same time , there I was in a skirt and blouse wearing makeup . <p> Dad did n't say much when he got in - shook his head a little , and then asked how the course went . It all seemed a bit surreal talking to him as if it was normal for me to be in a skirt . <p> A little before seven , our dinner guests arrived : my aunt , uncle and cousin and Dad 's friend , Eddie ( my new boss ) , and his wife . By now , I just felt drained ; the world could have ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made was that he hoped I 'd made up my mind about dresses , as he did n't want me turning up as a lad one day and a girl the next . <p> It was after 12 by the time I got to bed after bringing in the washing again and helping with the clearing up . When I got back to my room , the jeans etc had gone , and on the bed was a nightie . <p> In the morning , I showered and dressed - a simple a-line skirt . Mum brought through a jacket , and said it was time to go to the salon . I 'd forgotten all about it . I just could n't go in a skirt , so Mum let me wear my jeans , though I still had a blouse on . We arrived at the salon and were shown through to a back room . All sorts of things were laid about and Jean , the salon owner , told me to strip to my pants and lie on the table . She started to wax my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Annie to come through , and Annie proceeded to do the rest of the waxing . I 'd been to school with Annie ; it was really embarrassing , lying there with her applying wax , then tearing it off . We chatted , small talk , for me it was trying to hide the embarrassment . I just did as she said , even when I had to push down the top of my panties so she could do a bikini line and when I opened my thighs to let her wax there . Finally , I was waxed ( and sore ) ; she stood slightly behind me , and asked me to sit up . Then ouch ! - my left ear was pierced , then the right one . Next I sat down , as she gave me a manicure and pedicure , finishing with a couple of coats of red polish . I though she was finished , but , no , a few minutes more , and she 'd shaped my eyebrows . <p> When this was done I was allowed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my bra ( and fillers ) . Next , she came in with a waist slip which Mum had left for me . It was white satin with a wide lace edge , and came down to about my mid calf . Annie handed me a nylon wrap to cover myself with as I was to have my hair done now . The wrap only just came down below my bottom . I had to go back into the main salon to have my hair done . The ladies there commented on how pretty my slip was , and I was truly embarrassed , sitting there , as Jean and Annie fussed over my hair . It was washed and clipped and rolled and , eventually , I sat under a drier waiting for it to end . Mum came back just as I was coming out from under the drier , and she waited , as Jean applied some make up for me . When I saw myselfv , I was surprised , I was n't exactly a looker , but at least I was passable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mum had laid out a pair of high heels and a skirt and blouse for me . Dressed , I went through to Mum ; she handed me a jacket and we left . After this , we went shopping , and I ended up with another couple of bras and a skirt suit .

I was working almost entirely with women , and they treated me really well , even with the teasing . They helped me out with my poise and how to act like a girl . I must admit I was surprised at how rude some of their actions were . There were a few things happening that year , and this is already too long . They used a banana to show me how to ' draw a boy 's sting ' , and later on , when they 'd bullied Mike into taking me out , they insisted on watching , as I showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Christmas , we went for a winter vacation . I went as me , and changed to Felicity when we arrived . As a present , I was to have my broken nose fixed .

A couple of days later , I woke up with my face bandaged ; there was also bandaging on my chest . By the time I got home , I found that I now had a girlish nose and cheekbones , plus I no longer need the fillers for the B cup bra . <p> Anyway , sorry its so long . I stopped being Felicity most of the time as I went to Uni , though there were the holes ( still have the implants though - tight T-shirts &amp; loose jerseys cover them well ) . 
@@37517460 @6517460/ <p> You read so much about the harm of petticoating , but there are thousands of feminine males like me who welcomed the opportunity to wear girls ' ( and now , women 's ) clothing . I had an elder and younger sister and my mother raised us , my father leaving us very early in our lives . There was always going to be a heavy feminine influence on my life whether in play , emotions , attitudes and yes , even dress . I am not ashamed to say as a child I preferred having longish hair , wearing a kilt and wearing knickers ( I hated boys pants ) . All my life ( I am now in my 50 's , writing in 2009 ) I have worn knickers . As a child growing up in Scotland in the 1950 's , many boys wore knickers under their kilts , mainly blue or green , but sometimes white , and I preferred white .

I started wearing really long vests under my shirt and kilt . In some circumstances when glimpsed it looked like an underskirt , and at church my mother used to take great delight in reaching under my kilt and smoothing it down for my comfort . It earned me the reputation of being a bit of a sissy , but I really did n't care . From there I graduated onto my elder sister 's kilts for church on Sundays and readily agreed to wear a cotton underskirt for comfort . Later in my early teens , this would often be thick nylon and lace trimmed . <p> My family knew and encouraged my preferences , and wearing knickers through my grammar school and university days continued , as did wearing a ladies ' kilt on Sundays for church ( no sporran , too masculine for me ) . By then I had a number of lacy underskirts and full slips of my own , many received as birthday and Christmas presents . <p> My mother was astonished that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later became my wife . This in no way implies I was the masculine one in the relationship - my mother had always thought I would end up as the girl in a relationship with a man , not the feminine half of a relationship with a woman . When we married in Amsterdam she wore a trouser suit ; I wore an above-the-knee kilt and during the dancing at the reception onlookers were left in no doubt who was the feminine partner : the exposure of my " something borrowed " white layered petticoat , matching satin knickers and blue garter as I was spun around the floor produced whistles from the men and claps from the women . <p> A lot has happened since then and since retiring I spend rather more time in skirts and dresses and , particularly when my wife 's girlfriends are round in the evening for drinks , I often wear a pretty dress and make-up .

Young boys would often wear girls ' knickers as instructed by Mum to avoid their thingy popping out . The popular colour for boys was bottle green or navy blue , but a few of us wore white .

Girls ' kilts fasten on the left ( boys ' on right ) and were made of lighter material , and usually above knee length , and sometimes had a wrap round bodice . I wore girls ' kilts from the age of eight and I wore a plain cotton underskirt at my Mum 's behest for hygiene reasons and to make it hang better , but only to church on Sundays and visits to my aunt .

You could get away with wearing a girls ' kilt at junior school , but from around the age of ten it was certainly seen as slightly effeminate for a boy to wear a girls ' kilt and easily spotted by the female population . This is particularly so for a " man " wearing a ladies kilt . <p> Yes I was called various unsavoury names as a boy as I 'm sure you can appreciate , but we are who we are .

Secondly , one sees the models walking and flaunting the petticoats , something no young girl would have done in the 1950s . Those of us old enough to remember the magic era , recall that the whole charm and thrill would be a sudden glimpse of yards of frilly net and lace when a girl sat , or a sudden gust of wind revealing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt .

For the sake of brevity , the terms " marriage " and " wife " are used ; as appropriate to your situation ; please substitute your relationship . <p> In your marriage , during intimacy , does your wife ever wonder or complain that she does n't know whether you are making love with her , or making love to a petticoat ? <p> As an example , if your wife pulls on a petticoat and gets flirty , which leads to intimacy , either during or sometime afterwards does your wife ever muse as to whether you are making love with her , or making love to a petticoat ? <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frocks with bouffant petticoats , you were called a " cissy " if anyone realised that was what was in your mind .

Perhaps that spelling is peculiar to Britain . I thought that " cissy " was just a girl 's name . Some girls were called " cissy " , which I assume was a familiar form of the name Cicely . At one time ( up to the 1940 's ) Cicely was quite a common girl 's name . It was only when I started looking at things on the Internet that I came across the word " sissy " spelt with an " S " . I assumed that this was the American spelling .

The OED states that the use of " siss " was of US origin . It states that " cissy " with a " C " was first noted in 1915.

@@37517470 @6517470/ <h> PETER 'S PETTICOATED PREDICAMENT <p> I had never thought of myself as being a particularly naughty child , just perhaps a little prone to becoming bored especially during school holidays.So back in July 1959 at the age of 13 , it did n't seem all that terrible a crime to climb over the backyard fence , late one Wednesday morning , and sneak up on the tent in which those two awfully soppy girls Cynthia and Brenda , who lived next door , were playing inside . <p> It also did n't seem such so naughty for me to ' accidentally ' pull out the tent pegs that held it up , leading to it suddenly collapsing on top of them , with lots of girlish screams resulting.Of course , by that time I was well out of the way , having climbed quickly back over the fence before I could be recognised as the perpetrator of the tent collapse . <p> Or so I thought , because when I reckoned the coast was clear about an hour later for my lunch , I found my mother waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly annoyed . " So , Peter , what have you been up to thistime ? " she said.I tried to look as innocent as I could , but it soon transpired that I had been observed by Mrs Thomson , the mother of Cynthia and Brenda , sneaking away , after letting down their tent . <p> " I 've warned you before about picking on those nice girls next door . " said Mother . " This is the last straw , so go up to your room and change into your school uniform right now.I know it 's a week before you have to go back to school again for the new term , but I have an errand for you and I want you looking respectable for it.Off you go , you naughty boy ! " <p> 2 . NEVER TRUST A VEXED MOTHER <p> Well , I 'd been sprung , so there was nothing to do but carry out Mother 's orders and change into my school uniform , after a quick wash in the bathroom.When I came down the stairs in my school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me the usual inspection , and then handed me an envelope . " Peter , you are to deliver this right now . " she said.It was addressed to ' Edna Bainbridge , c/- Bainbridge Fashions , High Street ' in the local High Street.I knew Mrs. Bainbridge and my mother were old friends from way back , but it did seem a strange sort of errand for a Wednesday afternoon , seeing as it was half-day closing . <p> " Wo n't the shopbe shut , Mum ? " I asked . <p> " Edna and her staff are stocktaking this afternoon , so all you have to do is knock at the side-door of the shop and they 'll let you in to take this envelope.You 'll have to wait there for a reply.Now , on your way , and show me you can at least do one thing right ! " <p> So off I headed , without even getting a bite to eat for my lunch.I might have been only 13 , but I was n't so stupid as to see when obeying Mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile away from the High Street , and I knew quite well where " Bainbridge 's Fashions " were , because my mother and elder sister Wendy often visited it.On occasion , I 'd even had to go into the shop myself with them , waiting while they looked at this or that silly frock or bought themselves some new underwear or whatever.Luckily , the shop had a sort of outer waiting-room , with a pile of comics and magazines to look at while Mum and Wendy were checking out their new frillies or frocks.So the shop was n't as much of an awesome prospect as it might have been for a 13 year-old schoolboy like me . <p> I reached the " Bainbridge 's Fashions " shop just after 1 pm , seeing as the local Town Hall clock was striking as I turned the final street corner into the High Street.The shop already was shut , but I knew where the side entrance was and knocked loudly on the door.I heard some clicking footsteps and the door opened.It was n't Mrs Bainbridge , but one of her sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' according to her name badge . " Ah , you must be Peter , with the envelope for Mrs Bainbridge , " she said , with a strange sort of grin . " Well , come in , lad do n't just stand there ! " <p> I followed the gruesome Hilda into the shop , and was led through the main sales area with all the silly frocks and other stuff on display , into a side waiting room that I 'd never noticed before . " Sit down over there , lad " said Hilda . Madame Bainbridge will be here shortly to take control " . <p> With that , she left , closing the door.There was a sofa to sit on , with a table in front but no comics or anything to read.The only things of interest were some corset and brassiere adverts on the walls.Well , I might have been only 13 , but I was already noticing the interesting shapes of young ladies and the ways they achieved such things , courtesy of the magazines that Mum and sister Wendy used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEVIL AT ONE O'CLOCK <p> After about five minutes , Hilda returned , with no less than Mrs. Edna Bainbridge herself in tow.The door was ominously shut behind them . <p> " Peter , " said Mrs Bainbridge with a frown , " I 've been having some bad reports from your mother that you 've been very naughty today.You 've apparently been ignoring all the good advice from your mother about how a 13-year old boy should conduct himself , and disgraced your mother over your bullying behaviour with your next door'sneighbour 's two girls.Is this true , Peter ? " Well , what could I say ? I could only hang my head and mumble that I was sorry for what I 'd done . <p> There was a silence and then Mrs Bainbridge looked directly at Hilda , ignoring me completely.She just said " OK , Hilda , you know what to do.This young lout needs some strict petticoating to mend his ways . Please give him the full treatment as before , with those other naughty boys.I 'll be back in 15 minutes to check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking aghast what was this petticoating and full treatment going to be ? <p> 4 . PANTIES AND PETTICOATS FOR PETER <p> It did n't take long to find out.That awful Hilda was holding a pair of elastic panties , which she handed to me . " Peter , you have five minutes to undress and put these panties on by yourself.If you do n't , I 'll be back with my assistant Gertrude and we 'll do it for you.I should tell you right now that Gertrude does not like cheeky boys , and she carries a stick that she 'll use on your bottom if you do n't cooperate . " With that , she turned around and left , closing the door behind her . <p> I just stood there aghast.What could I do ? I tried the door , but it was locked.In five minutes the terrible Hilda and the even worse Gertrude with her stick would be there , to check on my progress.I might have been only 13 , but I was n't stupid so I stripped off all my schoolboy clothes and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and compressed my private parts so closely that I actually looked just like a girl the effect was surprising.There was a mirror in the corner of the room , so I could see just how I looked and it really wasa shock to see that I suddenly did n't look like a 13 year old boy at all.Apart from my flat chest of course , but that was soon to change ... <p> The door opened and there were Hilda and Gertrude , carrying several packages.They came in and shut the door behind them . " Turn around , Peter . " said Hilda . " Yes , that 's a good start you 're looking nice and girly already in your panties.But now we have to get you into your training brassiere , do n't we ? Put your arms out in front of you , there 's a good little sissy boy ... " <p> 5 . BUSTING OUT ALL OVER <p> It was so humiliating , but within barely another five minutes I 'd been fitted with a " Berlei Princess Training Bra , " along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure I knew just what I was being fitted with , whispering in my ear as she adjusted the bra straps , what a cute " Berlei Princess " I would soon be . <p> Bad as that was , worse was to follow.They made me turn around in front of the mirror now in my training bra and panties , this way and that.I felt so humiliated I wanted to burst out in tears , but I felt that it would just be giving in to them so I didn't.Maybe I should have , because far worse was to follow ... <p> As I turned around , Hilda whispered to Gertrude that my hips and bottom were far too slim still , and needed some additional " assistance . " They did n't realise that I could make out what they were saying , but I did n't have a clue just what that " assistance " might be.Within a couple of minutes I found out only too well , when Gertrude reappeared with a package marked " Playtex Magic Briefs . " The package was handed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my elastic panties.Those Playtex Briefs were padded around the hips and rear , with a constricting waistband.It was so embarrassing to then have to walk around in front of the mirror yet again , while Hilda and Gertrude ummed and aahed , but they did seem quite satisfied that I now looked more appropriately rounded . <p> I took a sly look myself at the mirror and I was amazed I actually looked like a girl , what with my budding breasts and rounded hips and bigger bottom . <p> 6 . IMPRISONED IN A PANTIE-GIRDLE <p> Bad as that was , things were to get even worse.Hilda said to Gertrude , " I think Peter 's ready now for his panty-girdle and stockings , do n't you ? " <p> I could have died right there and then , because my elder sister Wendy wore a panty-girdle to control her flabby bottom and waist and I knew it was not a very comfortable thing to wear , because she always complained when she had to wear it for going out . <p> Still , there was nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away to find an appropriate undergarment for me.They even measured my waist and hips now suitably altered by the addition of the Playtex Briefs , of course so when Gertrude returned with a " Berlei Sarongster Hi-Line Panty-Girdle " - it was a perfect fit.Well , that 's to say a perfect fit after the pair of them tugging and pulling it over my waist and bottom , but finally it was in place.I just had to sneak another look in the mirror , and it was really frightening now , just how feminine my outline looked.My waist was now much thinner , but my hips were wider and of course my bottom was much bigger too , which on top of myboobies , courtesy of my Princess Training Bra , really all added up to make me look like the perfect young teenage fashion queen . <p> 7 . KAYSER SEAMED STOCKINGS TOO <p> Of course , my legs were still my own - but they had that organised only too well also . " Hmm , " said Hilda to Gertrude , " those suspenders on Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we need to fit him with a pair of sheer nylons , just to complete the picture " <p> They already had brought a few packets of nylons with them , so it did n't take too long to have me wearing a pair of size 7 seamed Kayser dark-tan 15 denier stockings.The first pair they tried on were too long , so there was a minor delay while those came off and were replaced by the size 7 nylons , which were a perfect fit and reached the suspenders on my pantie-girdle perfectly.I was only a sort of mannequin while this was going on , becauseHilda and Gertrude were doing all the fiddling and fitting.The stocking seams seemed to be the most difficult part for them to get right , and I had to keep turning this way and that until they were satisfied that my seams were indeed straight . " Turn around slowly in front of the mirror , Peter " I was ordered.I could only obey of course , and I was so shocked to see just how feminine my legs now looked , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If it was n't formy familiar face , I 'd have sworn I was looking at the figure of some pretty girl.It was really quite disconcerting how all those various feminine undergarments had transformed me from a typical 13 year old schoolboy into a schoolgirl princess.However , that also was to change , because the door suddenly opened and there was Mrs Edna Bainbridge herself , carrying a couple of wigs . <p> 8 . DOROTHY LIVES , BUT NO WIZARD <p> " Well done , ladies ! " she said in her booming voice . " This naughty lad Peter is really starting to look quite a pretty girl now.All we need is to get his head looking appropriate tooWithin a couple of minutes I 'd been fitted with a schoolgirl wig complete with plaits dangling down either side of my shoulders.It was just so humiliating , to look like some kind of ' Heidi ' or " Dorothy ' from the Wizard Of Oz.However , they were n't wearing a pantie-girdle and seamed stocking like I 'd been forced to wear , so my embarrassment was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them checked me out from every angle , but they seemed to be satisfied.What was in store for me now , I wondered ?

@@37517472 @6517472/ <p> It was Halloween 1984 ( I think ) when all this started : a good time to go out " dressed " in public for the first time . A sympathetic female friend suggested that we go to a Manhattan Club which catered to " alternative lifestyles " ( I believe it was called " Le Scene . " ) . Of course , being married , but estranged from my wife , I could n't very dress at home , and my friend 's place presented logistic problems . So , we decided to take a room at a modest-priced hotel in Midtown and cab it to 19th Street ( as I remember ) for the festivities . <p> It was a fantasy come true ! I had never experienced the feeling of being dressed in public , never mind that I was dressed as a fifties gal , with tall heels and a bouffant skirt accented by a very wide stretch belt .

It was there that Bill , with a smile , produced from the mystery bag two deflated plastic rafts , which we blew up . Changing into a few pettis , she advised me to do the same we noticed someone on a rise a short distance away watching -he said nothing . But that did not stop us from launching onto the pond , and spending the next two hours relaxing and talking , dressed only in our pettis ! The wet pettis were definitely and unique experience ! <p> Bill and Tessy talked about a lot things , and she persuaded Tessy to launch a new website , dealing with pettis .

@@37517473 @6517473/ <p> I was still very young when I realized I had an absolute fascination with women 's clothes , especially their underwear - and was fortunate to have a mother with a drawer full of beautiful , lacy , satin and nylon lingerie . I was unfortunate enough to have an older sister ( I have no brothers or younger sisters ) who despised me - and I her . ( Only years later , when we were adults and got together to compare notes , did we come to the mutual realization that our parents had been playing us off against the other . ) <p> Anyway , Mom had a magical drawer full of wonderful clothes which felt so good , so fine , so pleasant to slip in to and experience . <p> My sister , on the other hand , had only utilitarian , unadorned , plain , cotton underwear , except for three rather large and noticeable exceptions : the three most beautiful , bouffant petticoats you could ever imagine in your most vivid , wildest , lovingest dreams . One was white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elastic waists . Drop yokes . Double ruffled hems edged with matching colored lace ruffles . Shiny satin horizontal strips about 2 inches wide were sewn into each of the petticoats at about mid-petticoat level . The petticoats were hung on perfume-scented hangers and kept in large plastic garment bags so that the petticoats would not get dirty or dusty ( they were not worn very often ) . Thus , when I unzipped the bag and took out the petticoat , it had an enchanting , intoxicating fragrance which I deeply inhaled ( Bill Clinton , eat your heart out ! ) and positively reveled in absorbing through every available pore of my being . <p> The last player in this remembrance was my father , who I recall as a harsh , strict disciplinarian , a fighter pilot in the Air Force who was not home a lot during my childhood but when he was he yelled a lot . Once I discovered the secret lure of dressing up in my mother 's lingerie and my sister 's petticoats , I positively LIVED for those " golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , there were many evenings when I could partake of those treasured " golden " moments . My parents would go out to eat or to a movie or some other undefined destination , while my sister would have some impolite remark to sneer at me as she left to go over to a friend 's house for several hours . Guess that left little ol ' me all alone . Boo hoo ? NOT ! ! ! Yippee ! ! ! You betcha ! ! ! <p> So on many an evening I happily indulged my deep , dark , hidden , forbidden , horrible , sexually deviant and irresponsible fantasies ( all attributes my father used when he found out what I was doing ) : I would strip naked and slowly , lovingly enjoy the sweet , sensuous pleasure of the feelings of the magnificent fabrics as they caressed my flesh , followed by donning one of my sister 's dresses which had a flowing skirt , or one of my sister 's simple blouses with a matching , flowing skirt . The BEST part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enchanting , fragrant petticoats . Historical artifacts and documents in the Smithsonian Museum are not handled as carefully , as lovingly , as gently , as reverently as I handled those petticoats . Just touching them sent electric-like impulses through my body . I was actually trembling as I raised one leg , then the other , and delicately brought them down through the waiting , hollow circle of the waistband . Then pulling the petticoats up while watching myself in the large mirror which crowned the dresser : The mystical , magical transformation of the empty , flowing skirt in to a living , pulsating , gorgeous , bouffant creation of beauty ! ! ! I can still recall how my eyes stung with my own tears as I lived those crystallizing moments in my life . <p> As my experiences grew in number , so did my confidence and boldness in dressing up for briefer and briefer periods of time . Remember , these events occurred in the era before answering machines , when door-to-door salesmen or the newspaper boy collecting for his route could show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had some pretty close calls ! ! ! <p> My first incidence of getting caught happened one evening when I was so sure I would be alone for hours on end that I never thought to keep an eye on the clock . I was sitting in my sister 's room , dressed in one of my mother 's bras ( the cups were filled with panties ) , a pair of my mother 's nylon panties , one of my mother 's Playtex panty girdle with Hanes stockings held up with the girdle 's garters , a pair of my mother 's high heels , one of my mother 's white , lacy blouses and one of my sister 's flowing skirts . Underneath the skirt I wore two petticoats , which caused the skirt to stand out practically like a ballerina 's tutu . I was holding the third petticoat the way Linus holds his security blanket in the Peanut 's cartoons : It was lovingly wrapped in my arms as I gently stroked the petticoat with my hands and at the same time stroked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swishing my legs together , savoring the sensation of the nylon as my legs rubbed together and also the feel of the petticoats against my legs . The bedroom door which led to the hallway was ever so slightly ajar . I never heard my sister come in the house . It did n't take long for her to make her presence known . Totally oblivious to everything else , I was in happily enjoyed life in my own petticoat world when my sister , standing in the now-open doorway , let out a blood-curdling scream ! ! ! To this day I do n't have a clear recollection of exactly what happened next , or the sequence of the actions which next occurred . All I can remember was my chest hurt ( from my heart attack , no doubt wholly caused by my reaction to my sister 's scream ) and both of us yelling at each other at the top of our lungs . <p> Somewhere in the melee of events , our next door neighbor came over to see if everything was okay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams , so he had come over to investigate and make sure we were all okay . Fortunately , my sister handled the neighbor at the front door . Meanwhile , I quickly got out of my sister 's and mother 's clothes , got dressed in my own clothes , and as quickly as I could rehung and replaced all of my mother 's and sister 's clothes exactly where they were supposed to be . In my haste , I forgot to close the sliding walk-in closet door ... which was a dead giveaway when my sister stormed back in to her bedroom , seething and promising a FULL , COMPLETE , WHOLLY BIASED report to our parents THE MINUTE they returned home and boy was I in for it this time ! ! ! My sister did not have to elaborate what " it " was ... I already knew . <p> Crying and blubbering like a newborn , I apologized as profusely as I could to my sister , making solemn promises that incidents such as this evenings ' would never , ever again occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she icily informed me that there was not so much as one chance in a thousand of that happening and that , furthermore , she was going to look forward to seeing what fate awaited me , so I might as well just accept that I was done for .... so there ! ! ! <p> My parents were late coming home . It was past my bedtime , so I was in bed . Sleep was out of the question , of course . I laid there , terrified , as I listened as keenly as I could to hear how my sister would relate the events she and I experienced earlier in the evening . My sister kept her word : With venom dripping from her every word , she related a highly embellished report of her discovery . My mother was crying . My father was cursing . My sister was complaining about how could she keep me out of her room and what could my parents do to help her ? My father came to my room . I pretended to be asleep and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event occurring to me on the same evening . <p> The next morning the whole thing seemed to have been forgotten . At breakfast , no one said one word about what happened or about the highly prejudicial report my sister had verbalized . <p> From then on , I adopted much more careful and conservative mannerisms when it came to dressing up in my mother 's or sister 's clothes . I " got away " with dressing up many more times , until I was caught one afternoon by my mother , the details of which will be revealed in my next episode . <p> #2 It happened during the Spring of the early 1960 's . My father was overseas . My mother had taken a job to keep her busy while Dad was away . I was in high school . My sister had finished high school and left for college . Fortunately , she left behind a lot of her clothes which she never figured to wear again , including several blouses , skirts , dresses with full skirts and , best to all ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and , yes , it DID seem natural to wear them ! ) , I took advantage of every opportunity to play " dress up " and happily donned my sister 's and mother 's clothing and accessories . But I had to be careful ... <p> At the time , I was in my early-to-mid-teens . I was growing bigger , taller and stronger , while the feminine apparel in the house seemed to be getting smaller , more delicate and a more snug fit . I did n't want to leave any " too obvious " traces of my dressing up activities , such as a rip or tear of any clothing . <p> One thing that I had NOT been able to " break " myself of was my near-tunnel vision appreciation and total fascination for the most magnificent clothing yet to be created by mankind : petticoats . With only my mother living in the house at the time , it seemed I could have a lot of time to myself if I so desired . By nature I am an outgoing , friendly person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports or girls . <p> My dressing up times most frequently occurred during the late afternoon or early evening hours before my mother returned home . Somehow , the " golden moments " I enjoyed when I was dressing in my sister 's petticoats never seemed long enough . I had to think of an alternative plan if I wanted to feel those petticoats more frequently ! The solution was n't particularly difficult : I started making excuses to leave school to go home . Sometimes I was n't feeling well ( I would come down with a " 24 hour flu bug " ) ; other times I went home for lunch ( and was often late getting to the class which started just after lunch ... my excuse was that I fell asleep watching TV while eating my lunch ) ; or I simply played hooky and ditched classes for an afternoon . My grades were satisfactory , so I was in no danger of failing anything ... at least academically . <p> My interest in donning petticoats was heightened by visual images I enjoyed seeing in magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fondly recall was seeing the women models spinning or twirling , joyously sending their skirts and petticoats flying " aloft . " Naturally , I absolutely HAD to experience those wonderful sensations myself ! So that became one of my pleasurable activities : While wearing the petticoats , I too enjoyed spinning and twirling myself around the room , all the while loving the images of myself in a large mirror which I had lugged from the bedroom into the living room , which was the only room in the house where I found I had enough space to allow the skirt and petticoat to fully " go aloft . " <p> One lunch time ( somehow , I was never actually hungry while dressing up ) , I was dressed in one of my sister 's dresses which had a expansive , flowing skirt , one of my mother 's bra and panty sets , a pair of my mother 's stockings and my sneakers ( my feet had grown much too large to fit into either my mother 's or sister 's shoes ) . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoats ? Or that I had all three petticoats sitting on the living room couch and would take one off just to put another one on , so that I could enjoy all three colors and also have a " contest " as to which petticoat went " highest aloft " when I was spinning ? <p> I was in a petticoat-charged , erotically-drunken stupor as I continuously hand-fluffed the petticoats , spun and twirled myself around the room , laughing and smiling and having a wonderful time ! ! ! ...... when I thought I saw a shadow in the room near the edge of the room where the hallway started . I stopped dancing and slowly looked around . No one was there . In a loud voice I called out " Is anybody here ? " Silence . Whew ! ! ! I got ta stop being so paranoid ! So I flounced over to the couch , slipped down and stepped out of the petticoat I was wearing , and stepped in to the next petticoat . My back was to the edge of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the petticoat and appropriately adjust the skirt when I heard my mother 's voice . <p> Mom was speaking in a quiet , controlled voice . She did n't sound mad or angry . She said that it was obvious I had been enjoying myself and wanted to know how I was doing . I carefully lowered the petticoat to the carpet and stepped out of it while at the same time turning to face my mother . There I was , standing in front of my mother , wearing , except for my shoes , not one stitch of male clothing . I was incredibly embarrassed and humiliated . I apologized to her . My mother told me to sit down . I did and she sat next to me . She took my ( trembling ) hands in her own . Her hands were soft and warm . Mom spoke in a soft , gentle voice . She asked me again how I was doing . I told her that myheart was racing right that minute but that right up until then I had been having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been silently observing me for about the last 15 minutes . I asked her why she had n't answered when I called out . She told me that , as a mother , it gave her great joy seeing her children happy and enjoying themselves and did n't want to spoil my good time . <p> I remember asking my mother what caused her to return home on this particular day . She said that the school had telephoned her at her office about my increasingly frequent occurrences of leaving the campus ( my high school had a " closed campus " ) during school hours ) and was concerned that I might be up to some mischief . So during her own lunch break , my mother had decided to drop by the house , just in case . Sure enough , her motherly intuition had paid off and she had caught me in the act of being a " crinimal ' . " <p> Then she said that I had better get changed so I could get back to school . I asked her if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked her if she was going to tell anyone . She asked me if I meant the other kids in the neighborhood , my football coach , or my father ? No , she said , this will be our little secret . Just do n't do it any more , okay ? I promised I no longer would . I kept my promise to my mother . For as long as I remained living under the roof provided by my parents , I never again worn any women 's clothes . There is a postscript to this episode : Shortly after my mother caught me , she removed the petticoats from the house . I never saw them again but I have never forgotten them and frequently and fondly think back to and recall and relive those wonderful , memorable times . <p> #3 I met Carol while square dancing . It had been about 5-6 months since my divorce and I was very lonely for some female companionship . Oh sure , I could have kept myself busy at bars and picking up hookers downtown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life style . I enjoy being with folks who are more honest and wholesome . Hard to get more of those admirable attributes than in a square dancer , I always said . And I was correct . Carol was a very nice woman to know . A little on the short side , a little on the plump side , but with a pleasant personality , a happy , cheerful face , a great cook and man oh man did she ever love that cushion pushin ' ! ! ! What 's more , Carol loved to be the recipient of unexpected little gifts such as flowers , candy , invitations to eat out , and lots of Victoria 's Secret lingerie ( unlike my ex , who always frustrated my romantic attempts ) . Carol always showed her appreciation the very same night . She loved to dress in her new lingerie and put on a private " fashion show " for me . <p> All that was really nice , but what I secretly enjoyed even more was what I was " forced to live with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could share living expenses as well as be closer to each other . Carol lived in a two-bedroom apartment . Her mother ( not an overly elderly woman but who had serious medical problems ) used to live in the room I was moving in to , but Mom had become quite i 'll and was now in a nursing home so that she could have 24-hour observation and health care . Carol told me that she was very sorry but my clothes would have to share the bedroom closet with her petticoats . I managed to control the excitement in my voice and the trembling of my legs as I assured her it would be no problem . And it was n't . My clothes easily fit on one half of the hanger rod , with her two huge , voluminous petticoats taking up the entire other half . ( One day , Carol explained to me that she left her petticoats hanging in my closet because her closet was completely full of her clothes . Thus , the petticoats could dry out ( from her perspiration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunched up " look if she had to bag them due to any other lack of available space . Again , I assured Carol that it was no problem . ) <p> I never told Carol about how , on almost every evening , while she was in the bathroom just before we went to bed , I would go to my room and just bury my hands and face in either the side panels or lacy hem of the petticoats , just loving the feel , the touch , the sensation of the fabric against my skin . Or , sometimes , I would take the petticoat off the rod , hanger and all , and just hold it close against myself or my own clothes ( if I was wearing any ) , then quickly replace the petticoat and hanger in the closet . Then , a quick , quiet kiss on the petticoat and off to bed and pleasant dreams . ( I was always very careful that I did n't leave any " marks " or " stains " on her petticoats . ) <p> Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though I gave her plenty of clues : I asked her to pose with me ( she did ) for a snapshot when we were both dressed to go out square dancing . We went square dancing as often as we could . I once asked her to dress up in her square dance clothes , including her petticoat , while we spent an otherwise quiet evening alone together . She did , although later she told me that she thought it was just another of my liking to do fun , impulsive things , all of which lead ultimately to wild simultaneous " gratification " later in the evening . <p> Carol found out about my fascination the hard way . <p> Three times a week on her way home from work , Carol would stop off and visit her mother in the nursing home . Since I always got home before her anyway , the situation seemed ideal for taking advantage of ... that is , jumping in to those gorgeous petticoats myself , even if just for one time ! ! ! Even if just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did . Only I did it more than one time and for more than one minute . Because Carol was a bit on the plump side , her square dance outfit blouses , which had lots of elastic in them , fit me . Ditto her square dance skirts . Ditto her elastic-waisted petticoats . I did n't have a lot of money ( remember , I had recently gone through a divorce and , as any man who has been through a divorce all too well knows , once through THAT wringer - especially in California - you hardly have two dimes to rub together ) , so I had to improvise when it came to lingerie for myself . Wearing Carol 's was out of the question : I told myself that if she found one of my body hairs in any of her undies , my goose would be cooked . So I left her lingerie alone . I did n't want to incur the expense ( or having to explain it to Carol ) of buying two sets of everything . Besides , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I did n't consider spending a lot to be cost effective . <p> What I wound up doing was purchasing four pairs of queen size pantyhose and one bra . One pair of the pantyhouse was for my legs . I cut off the legs and cut through the crotch of another pair . Those legs covered my arms and the panty portion covered my chest and trunk . ( The pantyhose kept my body hairs from leaving tell-tale reminders on the petticoats . ) Then the bra went on . Each cup got filled with one balled up pantyhose . Cheap , ugly , simple , but functional for my purposes . Plus , it was easy to crush and hide the mostly nylon items . <p> So , three times a week , for about 15-20 minutes each time , I enjoyed my private moments . Carol " enjoyed " them , too : When she would get home , I would have changed back in to my guy clothes and would be so worked up that Carol could barely get through the door before I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both eagerly followed up on ! ! ! And so it came to be that one fine day I was all " dressed up , " admiring myself in the full-length mirror which hung on the back of my bedroom door when , to my heart-stopping horror , the door opened and there stood Carol ! ! ! Although it was only a few seconds , it seemed like hours passed that we both stood there , neither of us moving a muscle , looking at each other with our mouth 's hanging open , not saying a word . Then , still without saying a word , Carol turned and walked back out to the living room and sat down . My stomach hurt , but I managed to pull myself together . I quickly changed back into my guy clothes , put away my lingerie and as carefully as I always did rehung her clothes and petticoat . Then I went to see Carol . <p> It was not a fun time to be me . Carol did n't want any explanations . Her voice shaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice as I guess she could have had at a moment like that , she said she wanted me OUT and she wanted me out NOW . No , she did n't want to take a minute to catch her breath . No , she did n't want to take a walk . No , she did n't want to go out to dinner and discuss anything . No , she did n't want to hug or have a quick roll in the sack . She said she had said NOW and she meant RIGHT now . Today . This minute . Pack your stuff and GET OUT . Thank goodness I had n't given her a ring or something more expensive than some lingerie . I packed my clothes and spent the night with some friends from work . The next day I found a place of my own.After that , Carol and I occasionally saw each other at square dances . She was always polite but formal the way the British are known for . Neither of us " pushed " the other to get back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened because we had seemed " the perfect couple " when we went together ) . After several dances , I noticed Carol never wore the outfit that she had caught me wearing , so during a break at a dance I asked her about that . As formal and polite as ever and , looking me right in the eye , Carol very quietly told me that not long after I moved out she decided she would never wear any of those clothes again and so had given the blouse and skirt to a local charity thrift store and , knowing how much I admired and adored the petticoat , had BURNED IT in her fireplace ! Stunned , I told her that that had been wholly unnecessary ; that if she had n't wanted it any more I would have been happy to purchase it from her at any price she wanted . I also told her that , to me , hearing of her having done something like that was like hearing about someone buring the American flag . Carol just gave me a little smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . <p> I eventually went on and met , fell in love with and married the wonderful woman who is now my wife . We are very happy together . My wife and I square danced for a brief while after we were married , then drifted away from it . But I did hear one last thing about Carol . She had married some guy from Oklahoma and had quit her job and moved back to the mid-West , where she now lives .

After square dancing for a few years in amidst a sea of petticoats , I decided in late 1997 it would be fun to go to a dance in a ladies ' square dance outfit as a gag . The lady at the local square dance shop put together an outfit for me . I got a woman partner to dress and dance the boy 's part , and off I went in my costume to dance the ladies ' part !

If your work starts drifting off where you wanted to sew then steer it back by turning the work pieces sideways as they are entering the foot ( BE CAREFUL ) . Also be sure that the top and bottom pieces of fabric stay lined up the way you want them . It ? s very common for the bottom piece to move under the top piece and if your not keeping track you ? ll find you ? ve only sewn thread onto the top piece when the bottom piece moved out from under the needle . Using pins to hold the pieces together helps , but still check . If you do use pins be sure to remove each pin just before it goes under the foot . Some people just sew over the pins , but I ? ve found that I get bent pins and sometimes broken needles from doing that . Go SLOW until you are used to how the piece you are working on handles . If you get off your sewing line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could by steering the work under the foot here ? s one way I get back . Stop sewing with the needle through the material . Lift the foot and turn the material so you ? re headed in a good direction to get back . Lower the foot and sew back to where you wanted to be . Again stop sewing with the needle through the material . Raise the foot and turn the material until it ? s headed in the direction you want to be sewing in . Lower the foot and continue sewing . This will leave a little zig in your sewing line . This method is also useful if you have to make a tight turn in your line of sewing . Other things you could do are : End the current stitching line , move the material , and start a new line of stitching . This will also be noticeable on the completed work . The last resort is to stop sewing , remove the thread from the current line of sewing on the material , and start over . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and visible signs of a problem . That is if you didn ? t damage the material while removing the thread . If you have to remove thread from material there is a tool I ? ve heard called by two names one is " Button Hole Opener " the other is " Seem Ripper " . It ? s a small sharp tool like a two tined fork with one tine longer than the other . It ? s sharp on the end and there is a cutting edge between the tines . The tool is inserted between the two sewn pieces of material and the cutting edge between the tines is used to cut the thread so the pieces of fabric can be separated . BE CAREFUL ! it ? s easy to cut the fabric and it ? s easy to cut yourself . 
@@37517478 @6517478/ <p> First and foremost , I look at my petticoats as the cake that goes under the icing ie : the dress . The petticoat must make the dress look its best and fill it out to its proper form . Right now I 'm wearing a beautiful long Quinceanera dress . It is a full length dress and is moderately puffy , and so is the petti I 'm wearing . Most of the time I wear shorter " little girl " style party dresses . When I wear them the pettis I wear under them a short but very poufy . <p> When the needs of the dress are satisfied , one of the other things I like in a petti is the slip style petti ( bodiced ) . Not having the body of a real woman , I like the straps to hold the petti up . Lots of bows on the petti and lace on the slip top are also a nice feature . And last but not least - a nice swishy sound makes the petti totally sexy ! <p> Heather in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am interested in length , fullness and colour . The length has to be suitable to hang properly under the skirt or dress I have in mind . The fullness is important to me , too . I love a sea of frothy billowing crinoline to be visible as I walk or sit down . Full crinolines ( 100 yds or more ) eliminate the need to double up one crinoline on top of another . Colour is important , as well , for I generally like basic white , but it is nice to get some variety with different colours . <p> Rhonda Risque 1/23/00 <p> Practically speaking , one should at least have several white petticoats . It 's nice , of course , to have different colors to go with different colored dresses . I 've always said that nylon chiffon petticoats are the nicest because they feel so wonderful and they have a very pretty look . Taffeta petticoats are also very enjoyable . <p> Davita 4/21/97 <p> " THE Petti " is the one at the moment that completes my outfit . It has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the right color--matching or contrasting . It 's got to be just barely peek out as I move about .

" THE Petti " is the one that makes me dream of how nice life is ! <p> Beth 4/22/97 <p> When I got up enough nerve to buy my first pc there was only one basic style in the store I was in . It was the original type of material ( not sure of the name ) and was fairly full . I had an old skirt my mother had gotten in Mexico and never wore . It was blue so I bought a blue pc and matching petti pants .... what a charge ! ! ! just buying it was an unbelievable feeling . I could n't wait to get it back and try it on . <p> All my later petticoats have had one basic theme .. the fuller the better . However , after being in both square dance and clogging groups I have refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original material , I realized that it looses fullness no matter how well you take care of it .

I try to buy now based upon color to match an outfit ( or better yet , one that will go with several outfits ) , I buy at least 19 " in length ( longer ones can be adjusted if necessary ) and sometimes experiment with other materials or combinations of materials but usally end up with the crystal . But most importantly , fullness ..... <p> I own several 80 yard ones and even wear several at a time .

The thing I really like in a petticoat is FANCY ! Lots of Lace ! , Bows , Ribbon , and Ruffles ! In complementing or contrasting Colors ! Matching lace and ruffles are okay , but I love the extra color ! A white petticoat with red rusching at the hems and red satin ribbon at the seam of each tier is Much ( ! ) prettier than a plain white petti . The seam at each tier of a petticoat is a place that just begs to be dressed up with lace , ruffles or ribbon . The yoke of a petticoat needs a ribbon bow or an embroidered heart . So far I have never seen a petticoat that I thought was overdone . More lace , more ruffles , more ribbon , more bows , more color -- that what I look for . <p> Donna Leanne 5/22/97 <p> I wholeheartedly agree with Liesel . The frillier the better .

You can also make statements about why you wear petticoats and other intimate thoughts about your pretties . Alternating blue and pink satin letters , or all the colors of the rainbow if you like .

@@37517483 @6517483/ <p> When I was 14 , my brother and I spent the summer with an aunt and uncle in northern Ontario . My aunt was a very proper , but kind and warm woman , who was always properly attired in dresses and aprons . This is when I say that , on one particular day , while my brother accompanied my uncle on a journey to Ottawa , and while my aunt was grocery shopping , I decided to explore the upstairs closets , dressers , cabinets , and loft . I soon discovered that my aunt was a clothing packrat and apparently saved every stitch of clothing that she , my uncle , and a series of grandparents and spinster great aunts , ever wore . One closet contained an array of dresses and gowns from the 30 's through to the 50 's . Keep in mind that this was a six bedroom Victorian in a small village . <p> Perhaps it was the musty aromas mingling with the pungent smell of aging cedar , or the rustling of silks and taffeta ; I was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950 's numbers . This particular dress was constructed of green taffeta and a black satin collar and bow/bustle . When I took it off of the hanger , it literally sent a chill down my spine . I was a tall teenager , slightly muscular , but slim . I positioned the dress in front of myself , as if I were wearing it , and sashayed in front of one of those tilting boudoir mirrors ; this all transpired in an uninhabited guest room with a large walk-in , cedar-lined closet . The moment arrived when I crossed the line and just had to try the dress on ; it almost beckoned me . <p> I was aware enough , having had parents who considered themselves 1950 's fashion hounds , that a dress such as this , could not be carried off without suitable accompanying foundation garments and lingerie ; my quest continued . As I searched dresser drawers and closets , I felt my heart pulsating and a warmth surge through my body which I had never felt before . I 'm certain that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act by my aunt . Eventually , I came upon some female relatives ' undergarments , reminiscent of an era of ultra-femininity and grace . Briefly ( no pun intended ) , I squirmed into a black all-in-one , boned , body-hugging girdle sort of thing , and applied a pair of white stockings which I found in one of my aunt 's dresser drawers . Though overkill and keeping in mind that this was a first time experience , I could n't resist a satiny Van Raalte half slip that my aunt seemed to favour , so I stepped into it . I still remember the wave of warmth and dread that I experienced , standing in that quiet bedroom , sliding a slinky slip over the stockings and the slippery boned girdle until it came to rest around my now slightly reduced waist . <p> During my hunt , I had discovered two crinolines or petticoats which had been left over from the fifties ; they were probably designed more for formal occasions than daywear and they would fulfill my purpose beyond my wildest fantasies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers , and an inner layer of black taffeta ; I tucked in the half slip as I pulled it up over my hips and positioned the crinoline with the bow facing out front . The second crinoline actually looked more like a fancy petticoat which dancehall girls wore in films that I remembered seeing . It , too , was mid-calf length , but had a lot more pouf to it , comprising three layers of organza and taffeta . The outer layer was bright pink and black and was adorned with pink bows ( where my aunt ever wore such a creation , living out in the middle of nowhere is still a mystery ) . It felt like hours as I carefully stuffed the first crinoline inside the second one , trying to inch the waistband up and into position . I must have been meticulous in this first experience , or perhaps it was just a firstborn overkill sort of thing , but a longline corset/bustier sort of thing also had caught my attention and I postioned it around myself , fumbling with hooks and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the waistbands that were accumulating aroung my waist . Several key events occurred during that time : the compression of that antique corset caused shallower and more rapid breathing that totally sent me , and I then felt as though I had actually transcended into a totally feminine experience , now being totally enveloped in lingerie . I quickly stuffed the cups of the outer corset with tissue , producing a curvy illusion and turned around to gaze at that gorgeous taffeta dress , spread across the bed in front of me . <p> At that point I almost turned back , but I was overcome with a sense of excitement which I had never before experienced . I positioned the dress over my head and attempted to slip it over my arms and shoulders ; the sensation of the taffeta against the nylon of the corset was almost orgasmic . This ordeal lasted about 5 minutes because I did n't want to rip the dress . When I finally positioned the dress over the petticoats ( it had a V bodice ) , I barely managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience began to culminate with the squeezing of my young man 's feet into a pair of mules with high heels . I remember feeling short of breath and looking into that full-length mirror ; it 's almost as though I was entrapped or cocooned in taffeta and lingerie . Many things stand out from this whirlwing experience ; the overwhelming sound of rustling lingerie brushing against the taffeta of my gown ; my feminine curves , surrounded by womanly fabrics , staring back at me from the mirror ; the constraint of both foundation garments , ultimately enabling me to squeeze into the dress and providing me with the temporary physical changes to carry off the illusion . <p> The bubble almost popped when I heard a screen door open from somewhere downstairs , and my aunt 's footsteps coming up the stairwell . Being only 14 , I remember thinking that my aunt might also enjoy my first time escapade ; she did n't burst my bubble . My aunt pushed open the half opened bedroom door and stated , " You look lovely but you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any of my things on , just put them in the clothes hamper so that I 'll have something clean to wear . " <p> Could she have know somehow that under the mound of petticoats lay her lace-embellished half slip ? Before I changed , I twirled some more , curtseyed , and practiced sitting on two types of chairs and the bed ; crossing my legs was somewhat challenging , being imprisoned beneath all of that lingerie . I often regret not having rescued the garments contained in those upper rooms before my aunt and uncle sold the house and moved to an apartment . My aunt and I have never spoke about my first and ultimate transformation , but I will never forget those two hours of entrapment in boning , nylon , lace , satin , and taffeta .

" Well you 're right . Typical man : All he did was open the wine to let it breath and watch me panic ! The last 10 minutes was spent doing my make-up , by which time they had already arrived . Everyone was in the lounge getting a drink as I entered the room . Now , I 'm not really one for making a grand entrance , but when I came in , both the wives ( who seem to know each other ) were saying things like , " Wow ! How wonderful you look , what a lovely dress .

My brother greeted me with a kiss on the cheek and introduced me to the group . Having witnessed the kiss , one of the guys took the initiative to do the same , and because one had , the other felt compelled to . <p> So , what a good start . I had been kissed three times and received multiple compliments in less than 30 seconds , and all I did was walk in the room ! I was feeling great , as you might expect . I was briefly looking for a seat to enjoy my drink and about to sit , when one of the guys ( I 'll call him " Mr. X " ) , offered me his seat , so I accepted and expected him to take the other spare seat which was alongside me . But no , he remained standing facing me ( as if to get a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would look me up and down . In case he decided he had seen enough , and , to keep him ' on the boil ' , I decided to risk crossing my legs while chatting .

Besides I envisaged spending the rest of the evening at the table with little opportunity of further teasing . I was n't sure if he had caught a glimpse of dazzling white petticoat or not , so a few minutes later I flicked my dress-skirt over my knees . <p> Now , listen carefully non-girls , because this feminine activity is difficult to describe , but a very effective method of showing froth . Flicking one 's skirt over is performed by lightly pinching one 's skirt near the hem in a feeble attempt to bring it further forward and ensure that it covers your knees ( and slip ) . The motion is carried out very quickly , but in order for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs ) a little as part of the initial movement . That 's the normal way , but for teasing purposes , I slowed down the movement and exaggerated the uplift to make certain some of the white lace edging of my petticoats could be momentarily seen . It seemed to work , because Mr. X 's rate of drinking increased dramatically thereafter ! He was caught in my spider web . I had a clear sense he was to be my main tease victim for the evening ( even though I was later to be proved wrong ) . Yes , I was plotting WICKEDNESS ! <p> After some chatting , and witnessing Mr. X 's wife giving him some murderous looks , I announced we should go to the dining room before the food spoiled . The other guy ( I will call " Mr Y " ) who , up to this moment seemed less intrigued , suddenly sprang up and gave me his arm in a very old fashioned ( but delightful ) manner , to ' escort ' me to dinner . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting interesting : two victims for the price of one . <p> We sat to dinner , which took at least two boring hours relieved only by the occasional need for me to visit the kitchen and bring out the next course . During these excursions , I tried to make best use of my attire , deliberately swinging my hips a little to make the petticoats move under the dress and create as loud a ' swish ' noise as possible . Unfortunately there was no opportunity to reveal any froth on these trips to the kitchen and back but , then I had an idea . I got up from the table and asked if anyone would like to listen to some music . I knew the answer would be positive , so I searched through a pile of CDs in the display cupboard at the other end of the dining room . From where Mr. X and Mr. Y were seated at the table , they could see all of me quite clearly . I plotted to select a CD and put it in the player but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the objects on the shelves ( so as not to knock them down with the big skirt ) . I arranged for just the right amount of skirt re-positioning that would enable these guys to see about 5 to 10cms ( 2 to 4 inches ) of petticoat . It was very likely they saw both petticoats ( white and yellow ) at least at the bottom edges . I then realised my brother had his back to me at the time , so he could n't see what I was doing , so I decided to be more daring by letting go of the skirt ( pretending I needed two hands for the CD ) and then holding it back again , but this time with almost as much vigour as a can-can dancer . They could n't fail to see petticoats this time unless they were blind ! I returned to my seat thinking it was all over , no more fun to be had . <p> But I was pleasantly surprised later when another opportunity arose . Mr. Y dropped his desert spoon on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieve it . Since he had not immediately found the spoon and , being the host ( or at least his ' partner ' ) , I bent forward on my chair and put my head under the table to genuinely try and help find it . Now , you have to imagine yourself leaning forward whilst sitting at a table and bending sufficiently to get your head under it .

@@37517491 @6517491/ <p> Recently , I carted 25 boxes of miscellaneous antiques , collectibles , and vintage garments to a two day nostalgia show , held in another city in our area . I had accumulated much of it from yard and estate sales , and , although many of the vintage garments were quite nice , many could not be sold on the Internet ; they would be a wonderful promotional tool for advertising to buy other items . In short , much attention was focused on my booth because I was the only vendor with vintage clothing . I sold several 30 's sheer dresses to a lovely 19 year old who oohed and aahed over the vintage slips , shoes , and accessories ; one of the dresses was destined for her May prom . I cleared out many , many items , but not before the moment when a middle-aged woman inquired if I would be interested in coming to her home after the show in order to purchase a large quantity of 50 's and 60 's items , left to her by a Great Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a room in the lady 's basement , we sorted through garbage bags of little 50 's sweaters , swing skirts , several elegant taffeta dresses , high heels , and assorted accessories . Much to her frustration , we could not seem to find a bag which contained , in her estimation , approximately 10 formal foundation garments , 1 full length crinoline , and about 15 slips , all from the same era . The lady queried her husband who explained that while she was attending the show , a neighbour lady had been given access to the room and had removed two garbage bags full of items unbeknownst to him , all for the sum of $15 . The only reasonable assumption was that the neighbour had absconded with some of the very best prizes from this estate lot . However , and much to my delight , the lady removed from a closet in the room , two white crinolines , both equally spectacular , from the same estate lot ; they had been hung up on a hanger beside the fur coat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fullness as well as both being constructed of a variety of fabrics ; one was several inches longer and a big SIZE MEDIUM , the other being a ladies SMALL . I purchased the crinolines , boxed stockings , 12 pairs of narrow-toed 50 's pumps , several bouffant skirts and dresses , many 50 's blouses , and some very demure sweaters , and carted them all home . <p> Now we draw closer to the point of my ramblings . I decided to contact a lady in our city who owns and operates a Victorian-themed tea room in her large and stately Queen Anne home ; she adores all manner of vintage clothing . I did not want to be bothered to sort , scan , and sell the vast myriad of articles on the Net . My wife seized several garments , including the mink , and I thought it prudent to sell a large lot , for one price , to someone else . We arranged for her to come out to our large , cavernous farmhouse later in the week , during the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , and I found myself indulged in sorting and handling all of the vintage garments which I was destined to sell . I will admit at this point in time , that the two crunchy , rustling crinolines , especially the smaller one , absolutely fascinated and perplexed me . However , I was all too well aware of the damage that I could inflict on the smaller waist band of the smaller crinoline . I had recently bought a royal blue taffeta bridesmaid gown , in a tea length , basque-waist style , simply because it had been priced at $4 , and because perhaps I thought that it might prove useful at some point in the future ; it was a size 20 and I could almost secure the back zipper . I completely fell off the wagon ( I 'm happily married and do not DRESS on a regular basis ) and became consumed with assembling a look from all of the garments that I was supposed to be selling . I still had a very imposing and heavily-boned Vanity Fair corselette , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and garters , in a lovely formal black colour . Fine , I admit it ; I stripped and forced myself into the corselette and fished through the bag of boxed stockings , finding a smoky gray colour that I thought would fit me . I wish now that I would have had the guts to shave my legs because I can not describe how wonderful it felt to remove them from the tissue and slide them up my legs , attaching them to the garter tabs . I stuffed the cups of the foundation garment and donned one of my wife 's blonde costume wigs , trying to at least protect the integrity of the illusion I was trying to create . In our clothing stash we have accumulated many pairs of vintage shoes and I found a pair of slingbacks that would reasonably accommodate my large feet ; I forced them in and began to feel very tipsy and awkward . Without exaggeration . when I picked up the medium longer crinoline , the crunching noises that it made , almost caused my knees to buckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinoline , one foot at a time , feeling the paper-like acetate inner skirt slide over the nylon of the stockings . I flung the dress over my head and forced it down over my modified torso , watching the event in our full length mirror . The crinoline brought the dress to life , almost throwing the huge skirt into a poufy expanse of blue taffeta . I fought with the zipper and was deceived by the country quiet security which provided me this wonderful opportunity . Without the word of a lie , my wife and our prospective clothing collection buyer , stepped through our bedroom door , immediately coming to a grinding halt , both of their mouthes hitting the floor . Our second floor is entirely carpetted , providing a highly efficient sound barrier ; I had n't even heard them come in the front door . My wife very calmly stated that this was entirely in my hands and that she had some things to attend to , briskly turning about and exiting the room . Well , the inevitable had finally confronted me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom I 'll refer to as " PAT " , seemed to have enjoyed my embarassing and uncomfortable situation because she did n't turn red and she had a Cheshire smile on her face . She said something glib like " I did n't expect you to model these things , but thanks anyways " . She also offered to help me with fastening the zipper of the dress , if that 's what I wanted her to do . I simply sat down on the bed and admitted that I had always been fascinated with 1950 's fashion and perhaps had always harboured some jealousy for not being able to actively participate . We talked for an hour and a half and looked at many garment and accessories , I ended up changing , and I met someone who shared my enthusiasm for vintage fashion . Pat bought many items , including the medium crinoline which I had inadvertantly modelled for her . One of her closing thoughts on that afternoon , two weeks go , was that I was welcome to drop in for dessert and coffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I was serious about my fashion fantasy , then she would entertain the notion of helping me dress , to the extent of actually looking real and interacting with some of her other friends .

On weekends she often wears jeans and looks great in them . She is just as likely to wear a skirt or jumper or sundress . <p> The pretty factor comes in with her lingerie . I know her collection well , as I do the laundry and care for her lingerie . She has two cotton panty and bra sets to wear when she is doing yard work or heavy house work .

She has single layer petticoats that she wears under a couple of long &amp; very full circle skirts , not the full bouffant look , but they give her skirts a noticable lilt . She wears the petticoats for one reason : the skirts look pretty with them . She is just as likely to wear them to go grocery shopping as she is likely to wear jeans . <p> I look at my wife , think about her fashion habits , and can only conclude that other women do n't dress that way mainly because they have not been exposed to it . They are clueless , through no fault of their own .

I 'd be interested in hearing some responses to my conclusions , especially from women . <p> 4 Apr 99 Bob <p> I graduated from high school in 1959 and grew up in the era of petticoats . I still feel that the fashions of that time have never been surpassed . The turbulent sixties did that era in because of the rise of the women 's movement and the hatred that separated the generations because of the Vietnam War . Except for a brief period in the eighties , petticoats have not made a comeback . I 've observed that when a woman wears something especially feminine like a wedding gown they spin and twirl and say how beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wear that type of fashion in any other situation . Personally I think it is because fashion designers and the woman 's movement equate it with being somehow degrading to the spirit of the " New Woman . " I feel the exact opposite . To show femininity is a sign of confidence in one 's self . A woman , like Pettilady , who shows her femininity because she is confident in who she is , and not afraid to show it , demonstrates a strength of character far surpassing most other woman in today 's world . Anyone who has looked at Pettilady 's pictures knows what a stunningly beautiful woman she is , a beauty that is enhanced by her fashion sense . <p> 2 Apr 00 Paige <p> One of the more obvious reasons women do n't wear petticoats anymore is that many women never or only rarely wear a skirt or dress .

@@37517496 @6517496/ <p> Does anyone enjoy trying to attempt perfecting a specific look , such as 1950 's formal elegance , or a bride , or a bridesmaid , or even a lady about to attend an 1850 's ball ? Is the experience enhanced by the selection and wearing of all of the related undergarments , shoes , gloves , etc. , and then by the awareness that those around you know you are dressed completely and accurately en femme ? <p> Suggested by Rosalyn <p> The assumption is that many out there enjoy the complete experience of dressing in foundation garments , hosiery , slips , and wigs , cosmetics , and ultimately , dresses which are fashionable , fit well , and were designed to accommodate one or more petticoats or crinolines ... or is just slipping into a crinoline in a quiet and empty place enough to satisfy ...

Probably because so many mothers do n't want to dress their little girls in these wonderful dresses and it gives dress makers a chance to practice their craft to the fullest since these dresses are so detailed .

The aura which surrounds women , half clad in elegant 50 's lingerie , fussing over the bride 's petticoats , hair , and makeup is more than a girl can stand . To be one of 5 pink taffeta-clad bridesmaids , enveloped in boned corsetry , silky stockings , and several organza/taffeta crinolines , represents the ultimate dressing fantasy .

To be photographed by guests as we gush over the bride , matching pink high heels clicking the sidewalk and gusty breezes revealing layers of petticoat to the world , cumulatively adds to the experience . Sharing the experience of having another girl zip up the tightly-bodiced gown to the point of breathlessness , and her subsequent comments about how natural your curves appear to be , only heightens the anticipation of having the wedding guests watch you precede the bride , her bouffant gown dwarfing your miniscule petticoated illusion . Still , when you make eye contact with a guest or two , and you are convinced that they know you are wearing all of the same feminine garments as your sisters , reinforced by the sight of the lacy hem of your outer crinoline , now peeking from beneath the pink gown , the boning of several constricting foundation garments plainly visible through the taffeta material of your bodice , you have established credibility and you know that your feminine illusion has succeeded . The fitting conclusion to this dressing event is simply to enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoat , and the taffeta of the dresses , and of course , to raise your hem in a teasing fashion from the dance floor , whenever a guest 's camera lens is pointed in your general direction . I personally would make sure that my modesty was preserved by the placement of a lace-edged Vanity Fair half slip between my corselette and the first crinoline . The only other hard decision would be whether or not to apply painted false nails on hands which would be covered by formal length white satin gloves for much of the event . Perhaps my salon transformation experience could encompass this theme , but then all of the attention to correct layering of lingerie and cosmetic shading would perhaps be wasted because of the absence of 200 appreciative wedding guests , 4 other " girls " , all enjoying the same dressing fantasy , and a petticoated bride to dote upon .

@@37517498 @6517498/ <p> When I was a teenager , my folks joined a square dance club and began taking an active interest in square dancing as a hobby . Within a few months , my mom had collected a few dresses , petticoats and pettipants . I always thought she looked exceptionally pretty in them , and was particularly fond of a cute blue one that had white lace around the neck , pouf sleeves and skirt ruffle . <p> I was old enough to stay home alone and do homework on the nights that they went out dancing . I soon realized that on the nights that they were taking lessons , I could be fairly comfortable that they would not return home for a full 3 hours . After a few weeks of internal agony over whether I was about to commit some horrible sin , I finally decided one night that I was going to try on one of the dresses . <p> Standing in front of my mom 's closet , I took the dresses out one by one and held them up in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would pick , but it was fun to see how the others looked . I got very aroused by just touching the fabrics , holding the dresses against my body with one hand and swishing the skirts around with the other . Finally , I took the blue one into my room , along with a full blue petticoat , a soft nylon white petticoat and a pair of white mid-thigh pettipants . <p> In my room , I laid the things out on my bed and took off all my clothes . Seeing how erect I was , I figured I had to do something to prevent " leaking " anything onto my mom 's clothes that she might detect later . So , I went down the hall to the bathroom and gathered 6 or 7 tissues . Taking them back to my room , I slipped on the pettipants , pulling them up to just below my crotch . After wrapping the tissues around me , I then pulled up the pettipants the rest of the way , such that they pressed against the tissues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull the petticoats over my head and shoulders and pull them down , or whether to step into them and pull them up . I picked up the white one and decided to try stepping into it . It pulled up quite easily , the elastic waist being similar to the stretchy kind in the pettipants . It felt fantastic ! I could n't help gathering the folds of it in my hands and holding it out , over and over . It was mesmerizing to hold it daintily near the bottom and slowly pull the fabric up , such that it glided over the lace ruffles of the pettipants . There was such a wonderfully tactile sensation in doing this , and the image of a kitten pawing around in a laundry basket came to mind . <p> The blue petticoat was stiffer and stuck out more , so I pulled it over my head and pulled it down over the white one , being careful to spread it out evenly . I then tried twisting my hips back and forth so that the petticoats fluffed out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I unzipped it quickly , pulled the dress over my head , put my arms through the sleeves and smoothed it into place . I was n't used to zipping anything up my back , and it took me a while to get the dress zipped , but when I did I felt as if I had entered seventh heaven . The dress came with a wide white sash that I tied around my waist , making a large bow in front that I then slid around so that the bow was in back . I could n't stop admiring myself in the mirror , running my hands over the material of the dress , pressing down on the skirts , fingering the lace trimmings . I suddenly realized that I was " leaking " a little fluid , and I started to panic - what if the tissues had moved out of place ? I tried laying on my back on the bed , and lifting all the petticoats in front up over my chest so that I could then lift up the waist of the pettipant and check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues had bunched up somewhat , and I was worried that they would not catch everything that might come shooting out . <p> I took everything off and went to get some more tissues . As I passed by the hall linen closet , I remembered my mom 's sewing basket was in there , so I decided to get a piece of ribbon to use to tie the tissues on snugger . While looking for the ribbon , I came across her rag bag . Fishing through it , I found an old white silk hankie with frilly lace trim . Taking the hankie and a piece of white satin ribbon into the bathroom , I pretended that I had a little doll between my legs and proceeded to dress her up as a bride ! First came plenty of layers of tissues , that acted like little petticoats , next came the hankie-gown covering it all , followed by the ribbon wrapped around the whole affair covering my shaft and balls several times and tied in a little bow in front . <p> Now I decided to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room and got a bra , some soft stockings to stuff into it , a beautiful old slip , some white support pantyhose , a white hair band , white lace gloves and a silver cross necklace . I contemplated trying on makeup , but was too concerned that I might get some of it on the clothes , so decided not . Back in my room , I put everything on and stood for several minutes in front of the mirror in absolute awe looking at what appeared to be an absolutely adorable girl gazing back at me . I was extremely aroused , but in a completely calm and peaceful way . When I would skim my lace covered hands over the fabric of the dress , I would barely touch it . All my movements seemed so delicate and refined . I put a pillow in the middle of my bed and got up on it , on my knees with the skirts spread out all around me , straddling the pillow between my thighs , and positioning such that I could see myself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touching my " breasts " gently , running my hands down my sides and up under the petticoats , breathing deeply and feeling electrified , I imagined that the pillow was the girl who lived next door , that she was dressed similarly , and that we were rubbing our crotches against each other - within minutes I proceeded to have a very long and intense orgasm better than anything I had ever imagined . <p> I collapsed back onto the bed and lay there in a euphoric state , sort of napping , for about 20 minutes . Then I realized I better get up and get everything put away exactly as I had found it . Of course , I repeated this for several more weeks whenever my folks were out , until one night disaster struck - the zipper got stuck , I could not get the dress off . I nearly had a heart attack , and the girl next door came over to rescue me . If you 're interested in hearing more about that , send me an email .

@@37517507 @6517507/ <p> Well , it was not the first time I had dressed up as a girl , but it was certainly the first time that my mom and dad " encouraged " me . It was the early sixties , and like many of you , I was a 10 year old catholic boy with an older sister . My mom and dad both worked and I was home quite a bit by myself after school and during the summer break , which is when I began to find my way into my older sister 's closet . I had been dressed up as a girl before by my mom when I was very young , and my dad had often told me how they had wanted another girl , when they were surprised with their son being born instead . I had also been dressed as a girl one night by some friends of the family who had 5 daughters . I remember how much my dad had enjoyed seeing me dressed that way .. ( I think I was about 5 or 6 when that happened ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's clothes and found her pettipants . They were so soft and so cute and they had a white fringe around the legs ; I tried them on and was in heaven . Venturing down into our basement , I found a drawer filled with a couple of full petticoats . I really liked this , and every day I found more clothes of either my sister 's ( she was a few years older ) . The pettipants and petticoats were just something I became addicted to , as well as dressing up every chance I had , which was about every day during the summer . I just could not stop myself - I really liked dressing as a girl . <p> One day , I tied a scarf over my head and went out the back door and down through our alley to the corner . I was so nervous , but so excited at the same time . I did not know that one of my friend 's moms saw me from her apartment window ( they lived in a three flat ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing and she said to me , " I saw your sister the other day walking down the alley - she is certainly a pretty girl . " I could not believe my ears ! <p> While I enjoyed this dressing up , I did keep it a secret , thinking that no one knew this was going on ; I did not realize my mother had known about this ( and I am sure she had told my dad about it as well ) . My father , for his part , had always wanted a second daughter and made no secret of it ; he tried to cover it up , but I knew his true feelings . One Halloween , many of the boys in the neighborhood decided to dress as girls for Halloween . They were just going to wear their mom 's dresses with their pants pulled up or wearing shorts underneath . One of my friends said he was going to wear his sister 's penny loafers with socks . When I mentioned it to my mom one night , she asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did , but I pretended to not be interested .. She was a bit surprised I think , and my dad seemed genuinely disappointed . He said , " Well , if your friends are going to do it , do n't you think it would be fun to try it too ? " That 's when my mom took me aside and told me she knew I had been dressing in my sister 's clothes , and in her clothes from the basement as well , and that it would be so nice for my dad if she helped me become the second daughter he had always wanted . I agreed ... much to my dad 's delight . <p> Mom took me into my room and told me to wait , then came back in a short time from the attic and the basement where many of my sisters clothes were stored , which she had outgrown . I learned later that my mom had many of her clothes stored down there as well - I just had not yet found them . As I was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with and the clothes fit very well ( which I knew they would ) . First , there was the nylon panties , followed by a long led panty girdle with garters , as pantyhose were not around at the time . Then there were the stockings ( which felt so good ) , and it felt embarrassing , but nice , to have my mom helping me . Then came a bra which fit well , but my mom still added a couple of foam liners for some extra fullness . Then four frilly petticoats which I had never seen before ! Next came a very full skirted dress which zipped up the back . I could not believe how full the dress was with all of the petticoats , as I had only found one petticoat in my sister 's closet to try on . Of course , with all of the petticoats , the dress came above my knees , and Mom told me to be careful when I was out , as the least little breeze or movement might cause my petticoats to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just giggled and I really did not know why at the time ) Mom had a couple of wigs she used for work and she found one that was shoulder length and , with a bit of blush and lipstick , I turned around to see a copy of my sister ... but it was me ! Of course , my mother was delighted , but not half as much as my dad , who called me his " little girl . " He walked around me and smiled and then gave a a bid hug and told me honestly that he had always wanted another daughter ; not that he was disappointed with a son , but he just wanted another girl in the house and now he had that little girl with " his " Tina Marie . I had never seen my dad smile that big - I knew he was really happy about this . Well , this year my dad insisted on taking his new little girl out trick or treating and kept telling me what a cute little girl I was and how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the block , he held my hand and told me not to be scared because I was a cute girl and he was here to protect me . As we continued walking , a gentle gust of wind came and , sure enough , it blew my dress up , revealing all of my petticoats . My dad thought this funny and cute . He said " You will have all the boys following you so they can watch that happen . " <p> We finally got to the corner where I would meet up with my friends but no one recognized me . They said hello to my dad and asked who I was , and I was so shy I could not even speak . My dad said why this is my " other " daughter , Tina Marie , but you probably know her as Tommy . Well , the look of shock on my friends ' faces was amazing , and they did not believe him at first . They came over and looked at me closely , and one of them finally said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad said , " Do n't you mean it 's her ? " Well , they thought this was so funny and said , " Yes , it is her - she really is a cute girl . They did not stop their teasing , and soon some of their older sisters saw me and could not believe this either . My dad was just beaming the whole time , and when one of the older girls raised my skirt she said , " Oh , look at the beautiful petticoats she has on and the cute girdle too . " After she had said that , my friends wanted to see that too . <p> I was so embarrassed , and my friends came over , lifting my skirt up but my dad intervened and told them that the wind would do a fine job of blowing up my skirt ! I could not believe he had said that . Of course , they all followed me as we went door to door trick or treating for the rest of the evening , and every time the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout . Since I was holding on to my trick or treat bag in one hand and my dad 's hand with the other , there was little I could do when the wind blew my skirt up . <p> Everyone talked about Tina Marie 's petticoats and girdle the rest of the night ( and the next day at school too ) . My dad kept encouraging me to behave like a girl and to not be afraid to show off my petticoats . By the end of the night my friends asked me if I could just become Tina Marie all of the time . I could not believe what was happening - they actually liked me more as a girl than as a clumsy boy who did not play baseball very well . My dad heard one of them say that and he turned to them and said , " Would you really like to have her in a dress all the time ? " They replied Yes ! My dad said he would have to think about it and then said , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer play sports or do boy things and she would have to be looked after as she was a girl . " <p> My friends all promised they would take care of me and watch out for me , and that I was not very good at sports anyway and they would love having me watch them play instead . After that night , my life really changed and during the summer break , they enjoyed having a new friend , Tina Marie , who they took care of and watched over as long as " she " was dressed as a girl and did not try to be one of the guys . In fact , my mom and sister made sure that I had plenty of dresses and petticoats to wear through the summer months , much to the enjoyment of my friends . I also was more accepted by the girls in the neighborhood , but that 's another story . There are more stories yet to come , and I will send more if dear Tessy will publish them for me. 
@@37517508 @6517508/ <p> For me , one of the nagging problems with being T is that things never seem to fit just right . ( I meant that in a sort of non-physical , psychological sense , but as in all great writing , the statement can be interpreted at many different levels . ) A lot of my T-time activities have involved searching . Searching for something and never finding it ; or finding what I thought I was after and deciding that , " No , that was not It. " <p> I have spent a lot of time searching for things on the net , never exactly sure for what . Most of what I found was definitely not " it . " One of the sort-of-fun places I ran across was www.pettipond.com , a CD place focusing on petticoats . The girls that are really into that call themselves " Pouf Bunnies " and unlike some of the costume sites that often strike me as a little less than positive and uplifting , the Pouf Bunnies seem to be trying to just have fun and enjoy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do with " imprinting " at some key moment when an organisms systems are primed to receive some signal and lock on to it , it will do that even if the signal is from the wrong station . For those of use who did the puberty thing in the 50s , it is easy to see how one could lock on to the crinolines , the full skirts and the petticoats that were so very popular back then with the girls of our peer group . As a point in passing , the famous poodle skirt , to the best of my memory , was NOT all that hip , at least not on the West Coast . <p> So , when I discovered the Pouf Bunnies , I could relate to what they were all about , even though my systems had homed in on different signals back then . Being an open person , I thought , " Maybe the Pouf Bunnies are on to something I might enjoy . Maybe I am missing out on something . " And never wanting to miss out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then . <p> One of the things I think we M2F T-folks grieve about sometimes is having missed out on female childhood experiences . There were a lot of cool , girl things going on in the 50s and I remember sometimes being very sad about not being able to be part of them . ( There were also a lot of cool guy things going on then also , and I DID do a lot of them , and was glad for that as well , so it was not all gloom , misery and sadness for me . ) <p> So , what is a poor aspiring Pouf Bunny to do ? Milk the experience for all she can . I went to Wal-Mart and bought several yards of white nylon netting and some white acetate brocade along with several yards of a yellow cotton print cloth off of the $1/yard table . I went home and drew up a pattern for the petticoat , and another for the full skirt . Several nights latter I had a passable , wonderfully full white petticoat and a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sandals I do n't  look bad at all . A bit too old and saggy to blend in with the American Band Stand crowd , but the look is still there and a lot of memories are triggered and some longings fulfilled . <p> The best of it all is that I recreated an experience that would have been mine if Ms. Leslie had been Miss Leslie back then . In the 50s all girls took Home Economics , which included sewing , and most of them put that to good use in sewing lots and lots of the full cotton skirts and the petticoats . I suspect that a motivated girl could turn out a skirt in 30 minutes after school with the proceeds from less than 2 hours of babysitting wages buying the cloth . No flaps with the folks as to why she needed another skirt , and she would have something new to wear the next day . <p> Finally getting to experience all of that was really the best part . The skirt and petticoat are a good addition to the wardrobe . Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 10th grade Home Econ class project . Perfect for a barbecue or a picnic . Cool , easy maintenance and attractive not only in a retro-way . <p> I had not thought of my Singer sewing machine as a time machine , but it can be . As for being a Pouf Bunny , I doubt it--a Pouf Mouse or a Pouf Hamster maybe , but not a full-fledged Bunny . 
@@37517509 @6517509/ <p> During the late 70s , at 16 , I was compelled to board an hour or so by motorcycle away from home to attend High School Certificate college . I was staying with Mrs. D , a middle aged divorcee in a nice suburb , and on one particular weekend had decided to remain in town to attend a birthday party of an economics classmate , Oriana , a second-generation Portuguese girl of 17 . <p> As the party approach , scheduled for the mid-afternoon I happened to look at the invitation , only to notice that it was entitled an " S-party " . In my naivety , I queried Mrs. D , who was in the lounge with her 20-yo daughter Caroline ; she was visiting from Hobart . Mrs. D explained that people were required to attend in costume or in theme ; that is , utilising the letter ' S ' . I was in panic ! I could think of nothing and , in any case , the shops were all closed from Saturday afternoon on for the whole weekend ( as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and said flatly , " Square-dance " . After a pause , Caroline , Mrs. D and I were trotting down the cellar steps and , whilst I held a flashlight , they then retrieved a large trunk from behind a support pier and had me carry it back up into the house . Opening it up , we had to remove tissue paper and some mothballs before a sea of material . At this point I began to get nervous and , when they said we should do this upstairs , I began to actually panic , mumbling how it was n't important and Oriana would hardly turn me away from the party because of an oversight . They werent listening . <p> Upstairs in Mrs. Ds large bedroom , her square dance outfits were laid out : several flared cotton dresses , including a white poker dotted dress with puffy sleeves . She had three enourmous petticoats in blue , red and white , which were multi-tiered in order to give the full effect . At the bottom of the box were some shoes , underwear and accessories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I were not even there . Caroline was getting really enthusiastic and finally turned to me and said I should go have a shower . Whilst wanting to respond , I could only do as I was told . When drying , myself there was a knock , and Caroline passed around the door the frilliest white pair of what I now know as pettipants . Lamely , I put them on and , using the towel around me , returned to the other two . Caroline immediately removed the towel and clipped a bra around me from behind . Using some rubbery inserts which , I assume shed used in earlier years , she gave me reasonable but not undue cleavage . <p> At sixteen , I was pretty hairless on legs , chest and even face . Therefore , without further ado , Mrs. D selected the white petticoat and laid it on the floor , bade me step into it , then whipped it up to my waist . Whilst elasticised , it also had a small tie for security . Almost immediately , Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I disappeared into a sea of material , the other two pulling it down about me . Finally , my head reappeared and the bodice was in place . Caroline buttoned me up at the back whilst Mrs. D fluffed the dress out to fully reach edge of the top petticoat layer . Black leather court shoes were brought out but I could n't seem them to slip them on ! Caroline had to kneel down and place them on my feet , noting that it was fortunate Mrs. D was such a big woman . <p> The next half an hour was a blur . An ash-brown wig , makeup and walking in heels familiarisation took place before I was allowed to look at myself in the hall mirror . It was scary ! I looked good . Convincing . But I was scared and , moreover , I was excited . What an amazing sensation of material , lace , underwear , skirts and hair ; complemented with perfume and the enforced method of deportment brought about by 3 inch heels and a voluminous skirt ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in the backseat because the layers and skirt obstructed the gear shift ! She explained that when she had danced , the petticoat was usually taken in a bag and donned immediately before dancing began . After she dropped me off ( promising to pick me up at the end ) I rang the door bell . Oriana answered and did n't  have a clue who I was . I had to tell her . Her face was a picture of disbelief , then a wonderful smile and a big hug . <p> Ironically , I had been the only guy invited to the party but given the way I was dressed , it may as well have been an all-girl affair . Somehow , I was treated as though I was a girl and I really enjoyed the banter . One of the girls , Karen , had a bit much of the cyder and tried to corner me in the bathroom and get under my skirt . Fortunately , Orianas mum saved me and sent Karen to bed to sleep it off ! <p> Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Driving home she asked me all sorts of questions about the day and how I 'd coped .

Caroline was a shapely and athletic girl , and in the minutes that followed no 16-yo boy in a huge skirt was permitted to say no . She was all over me . You can guess the upshot , but I guess the major outcome for me was the fact that I was hooked for life . To experience foreplay , etc. dressed like that with an attractive partner had taken me across a boundary from which there was no return .

I hope that you like this , one of my fondest memories . <p> I had always been aware that my mother would have preferred to have had at least one girl out of the three of us boys . I suppose it was natural that as the youngest by three years I would bear the brunt of her needs , as ( I found out much later ) she was unable to have another go at producing the daughter she craved . Let me be quite clear , there was never any cruelty or abuse , just the odd little " accident " involving spilled drink , trousers that just " had " to be rinsed and me " conveniently " being in a house with only two daughters , one of which would be dispatched to fetch a clean school dress .

On the return journey home I was taken to buy some new school trousers . Those who live in England and are of a certain age will remember that in 1977 there was a huge ' GREASE ' craze with all the shops catering for teenage girls being full of the kind of clothes that had n't been seen for twenty years ; the girl 's section of the shop was a mass of satin and net .

I would , of course , have to have " something smart " to wear , which we could go and buy after we had eaten . I readily agreed , and we were soon back in the shop we had not long left . Having looked at the clothes for ten minutes , my mother eventually said something like " Oh , if I could only get you something from that side of the shop , " and nodded towards the girls ' department . I had been half expecting this comment and , without thinking , said , " Let me have the rest of the week off school and I 'll let you . " She looked at me and asked in a whisper if I was serious .

I looked at the dress , which was quite horrible , far too frilly with ruffles around the skirt ; it looked like something a flamenco dancer might wear . <p> " Sorry , " I said , " I do n't like it . " <p> She nodded towards the next rack . " How about those ? " <p> I looked at the much plainer dresses and eventually accepted a white dress with small , navy blue polka dots .

It was only then that it dawned on me that I had actually allowed a dress to be bought for me and that tomorrow I would be wearing it . <p> Surprisingly I was actually looking forward to it . <p> Tuesday morning , as soon as my father had left the house ( he never knew about any of this ) my mother got me out of bed and directed me into the bathroom , where a bath had already been run for me .

I stepped into the soft material under the loving gaze of my mother as she carried on ironing . " Nearly ready love , " she said , and soon she unplugged her iron and held the waistband of the immaculately prepared petticoat near the ground for me to step into , its pale blue lace trim spreading over the carpet .

Then I learned the official truth : I was a boy and I was going to get a suit to wear . A drab suit and pants . I thought it quit unfair , but what was I to do ? Ask for a white dress like my friends ? Not if I wanted to be teased ; I did n't . Still , I felt quite gypped about it . I lost all interest in the event . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

So I accepted my fate and went down the isle in my suit and the Bishop presented me a black rosary and prayer book for boys instead of the glass rosary and pearl-covered prayer book for the girls . Nancy was so pretty in her dress ! Each time she moved , she kicked the petticoats high and swished down the aisle . <p> When I came home , Mother had me go into my bedroom and change , but not into my old clothes , but into a white communion dress . It had everything from the nylon panties to the white hi-top socks that were so shear that the lace could clearly be seen on the background of my skin . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time dressing ; so much that Mother came back to see what was wrong ; but it was perfect . Mother curled my hair , and attached a little vale to my head .

Nancy come over and Mom took pictures of us in our dresses . It was a wonderful memory . <p> Today , I live as a female and teach little girls in a girls ' school . Later this year I'ill have an operation to complete my transformation to a female . I still have the prayer book and , of course , my First Communion dress wrapped carefully in a box in my closet .

Lots of those " cute " little satin costumes and lipstick and rouge . I can remember each and every time . <p> When I was in 4th grade , I had the part of " Prince Nutcracker " in a play that was loosely based on " The Nutcracker . " My mother made the costume ? it was a pair of green satin knickers and a dress-like tunic of green and white satin that had a high neck like a Nehru jacket . She covered a pair of my slippers with white satin . She had to borrow a pair of white tights ( hose , actually ) from a girl cousin the same age as me .

My grandmother 's sister lived next door ... about half a mile away , with her 32 year old bachelor son and her husband . They were farmers . I liked this aunt a lot and used to go over to her house frequently . <p> One day , we were out in one of the barns and she was going though a bunch of old trunks that were stored out there . A couple or three had lots of clothes in them ... very old clothes . I remember that she took out one which was a very sheer gown .

She indicated her son had been when he was little , and even my father . She suggested that I could wait for my grandmother to come over and " fool " her . It intrigued me , but I deferred ? not refused , mind you , but deferred . I think I said something like " Maybe next summer . " My primary concern was the men finding out about it . <p> Shortly after that , I was at her house and she was showing me old photo albums . Sure enough , there was a picture of her son , in a fancy party dress , tiers of lace , Mary Janes , and white stockings . His hair was short , sort of waved , with a big hair ribbon . There was another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Little Lord Fantleroy outfit . Another thing that surprised me was that this last picture appeared for all the world to have been professionally taken in a studio . <p> I remember thinking about it for a couple of weeks . I was intrigued by girlish things even at that age , but also very sensitive to giving any hint of being a sissy . My father was a tyrant ( indeed , the name " jolene " derives from an adorable little girl who lived in our neighborhood . I recall he would sometimes taunt me by calling me that name . ) If I could somehow ensure that it would be a private thing with my aunt , I wanted to " explore " it . <p> Finally , I made my mind up . I was very circumspect with her about it . I think I finally maneuvered her back out into that same barn , hoping that she would propose it again .

I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern about the men finding out , and she reassured me on that point ( although I would later discover that she thought my concerns were silly , I felt safe ) . It was mid-afternoon then , not enough time to do it before the men came in from the fields . So , instead , she sent me back to my grandparent 's house and gathered up a bunch of things which she washed and ironed . She told me to come back the following morning for breakfast . <p> I was there as soon as I saw the tractors pull out of the yard . It was this " big adventure " we were going to have . I was scared and excited . She had me bathe and wash my hair . She put me in an old chenille robe of hers and put my hair up in curlers and pin curls .

Some time later she came out and undid the curlers and pins . Then she took me back inside . The rest of the costume consisted of three or four petticoats , lace and eyelet trimmed , and what I remember to be a gorgeous overslip that went over them . The dress was white chiffon and satin with lots of ruffles . It buttoned in back and had a pink ribbon sash . The shoes were white MJ 's . I have no idea to whom the dress belonged , but it was something from the 20 's I think . <p> My reactions were that continued excitement and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go ahead with showing myself to my grandmother done up like that . I know I expressed my doubts about it and was again cajoled to the effect that my grandmother would get a big kick out of it . She capped the whole thing off with a ribbon in my hair , which caused me more consternation than all the other finery . She called my grandmother to walk over for a cup of coffee and to " see a surprise . " I guess I figured the die was cast , for if I shucked it all my grandmother would have asked ? and likely been told ? what it all was about . For this reason , I think , I went along with two final items : She gave me this parasol to carry and daubed rouge on my cheeks and put a little lipstick on me . <p> I guess I was adorable .

I hammed it for a while , but I was paranoid about someone else finding me like that . After lunch , I took off all the clothes , scrubbed my face nearly raw and plastered my hair down with water to kill the curls . <p> That was the first time . There were others . Most significantly , the pictures were found the following summer by three girl cousins who also had extended vacations with my grandparents .

" Gather round , girls , " she said to those awful minxes , who needed no encouragement to get as close as possible while I was progressively given coats of lipstick of all different shades , my face blotted with powder and rouge and finally , the worst of all a pair of false eyelashes ! Mrs. Thomson stood back to admire her handiwork , and the throng of little giggling girls actually started to clap .

I think my feelings when I put on that silky slip and oh-so-soft petti are probably just the same as a CD who wears them . Growing up poor I never had a complete matching set of anything , and dresses were rare because they cost a lot more . But I remember my only petti like it was this morning . I would play dress up with my friends , and I 'd wear it instead of a skirt because I had no dress to go with it .

I 'm not a big fan of satin for the outer garments -- I 'm a cotton and velvet girl . Tights are OK , but I really prefer garters and stockings , unless I 'm dressing up as a LG . Then I tolerate tights , but I buy one size too big , for comfort . The waistbands always leave unsightly ridges under my clothes because , although I am not very fat , I am soft . and you know , I think that even if a CD were to suddenly become a girl , they would still like the feminine fashions simply because they are so feminine and pretty and feel so good ! <p> 17 Apr 04 Elle Kay <p> I love to wear clothes that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my lingerie feels against my skin , the way the ruffles on my skirt move as I move .

I do feel though as a woman we can sometimes take the feelings our clothes give us for granted . <p> 21 Jan 00 Maria <p> Wearing beautiful things is a very pleasurable experience in many ways - but , like Allison , I agree that the practicality issue does have an impact on how often and when you can wear these things . I would hate to have to wear " feminine " clothes all of the time . They are often a hindrance to basic comfort , and are frequently more of a " trap " than a pleasure . ( They come to define ' femininity ' , when it is really so much more . ) <p> 30 Dec 99 Allison <p> The idea of " dressing to the nines " is one that few people have the time for these days . As a woman , I enjoy beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do so , but a beautiful dress with long flowing skirts ( my favourite ) or slinky dresses that show off all of the curves are not practical on a day to day basis . <p> In the business world , women , like men , must dress to the codes of the job and if one hopes to get anywhere in the organization , dressing to the code is an important a factor as anything else . I may not be a big fan of business wear but I am compelled to wear it : a comfortable pair of jeans and a sweat shirt just wo n't do . So the skirt and jacket and the top are part of the outfit no matter what I think . <p> Would TV 's feel the same way if they awoke as women ? Yes , I think so , at least after a while .

The old saying that when you look good you feel good is as true today as it always has been : it does n't mean ( necessarily ) that it is a sexual feeling , but more that you feel ready and complete and natural . The pressure of image is something that women feel more than men I think , a pressure that they have brought upon themselves in many ways , but a reality nonetheless . And while I sometimes hate and resent the way that others ( mainly men , but not exclusively ) treat me , I still like being me and enjoying my life as a woman . <p> 8 Oct 99 Kitten <p> Yes , there are women in this day and age who enjoy wearing crinolines .

I finally got brave enough to start wearing them out in public and I loved it . The feeling of being so totally feminine and , the way they move with you as you walk was incredible . I normally like to be more feminine in my clothing , with wearing stockings and all , but I could not have felt more so if I tried once I was wearing the crinoline .

From what I understand , it is the symbol of it , along with how it looks , that they enjoy so much . I do n't see how anyone , having worn them , be the person male or female , wanting to give them up . They become a statement of who you are and how you want to be treated .

However , I suppose it is the men 's fault , mostly . They have given women , in general , the impression that the only thing they want is nudity or semi nudity , and the women in this country at least , have bought that hook , line , and sinker .

It is not a question of being a " sissy " it is just a long forgotten style that many of us ( men and women ) hate to give up ! A lot of men tell me how wonderful I look and they wish their wife would dress like this .... their wives are wearing jeans and t-shirts at the time . Pardon me ! !

@@37517522 @6517522/ <p> What a marvelous topic ! And , I might add , a topic which I can speak to directly as I have had several personal , first-hand experiences enjoying this exciting , pleasurable feeling . <p> To set the stage : I am not a " professional " twirler . I 'm not even sure there is such a profession . All of my twirling experiences occurred during an extended period when my wife was out of town attending to personal matters . As a lifelong petticoat aficionado , I knew it was now or never for dressing in petticoats and all my other female square dance finery , then getting out there and dancing and having a good time . So that 's exactly what I did . <p> My wife and I were square dancers at a local square dance club , so I knew from general conversation how any person ( crossdresser , gay , etc ) out of the " norm " was not accepted and generally frowned upon . As a crossdresser , I knew that if I wanted to fulfill my fantasy of dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and lesbian square dance club . Via telephone , I did just that and soon found myself amicably chatting with the club president . He told me that the club , unlike the " straight " clubs , was very accepting and accommodating of all orientations . When I told him that I was a crossdresser and wished to dance while dressed in womens clothing , he said that would be fine . My " outing " myself as a crossdresser to him did n't  seem to make the slightest difference . He then asked if I would be dancing the male or female position . It had never occurred to me that I might dance the male position while dressed as a woman . I told him I would like to dance the womans position . He again said that would be fine . He gave me the address , date , and time of the clubs next regularly scheduled dance and said he was looking forward to seeing me there . Wow ! <p> I showed up , dressed en femme ( wig , pretty blouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very full petticoat ) and was immediately and warmly greeted by everyone in attendance , both men and women . I quickly noticed that I was the only person in the entire room , man or woman , not wearing blue jeans or slacks . Needless to say , in all my en femme finery , I really stood out , and I 'm not just talking about the bouffant-ness of my petticoats ! I loved it ! <p> ( A side note : Since there were more men than women at the dance and some men would be unavoidably pressed into dancing the womens position , in order to make it easier for the dancers to recognize the men from the women , some men wore pink plastic leis . ) <p> Almost as soon as the first call started , I was having trouble keeping up . Since I had never danced the womans position before , I kept turning and moving as I would otherwise have done if I were dancing the male position . After breaking down the square and we had all returned to our starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square and explained my predicament . Fortunately , the other dancers quickly understood and forgave me . My partner , a very large and very tall man , calmly assured me he would help me along . <p> When we once again began dancing , sure enough , every now and then my partner used his hand on my shoulder to gently guide or turn me in the proper direction . After one " patter call " and then one " dance call , " I was moving easily and comfortably in the womens position . My partner and I agreed that I seemed to have quickly and easily learned the moves of the womens position . <p> Between tips , my partner asked if there was anything else I thought I needed to learn . I told him I would really like to know what it was like to be twirled like a spinning top . He just grinned and said that he would see what he could do . Shortly after that I caught a glimpse of him having a quiet word with the caller . <p> Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My partner was by my side , grinning . I must admit I was a bit " tingly " knowing what was soon to occur . Apparently the word had gotten around to everybody else in the club , because everyone else in our square was also grinning . My partner leaned over and asked if I had ever been twirled before . I told him I had not , but had often fantasized about it and was excited about what was about to happen . He then asked if I was wearing underwear . When I looked at him as if to ask " what ? ? ? ? " he quickly explained that the club had a policy of no nudity or other inappropriate exposure . I told him I was wearing a complete square dance ensemble , outerwear as well as underwear , and that there would be no problems . <p> The caller began and the calls and movements seemed perfectly ordinary . My partner and I were moving along nicely when the caller said : <p> " Star once around and give her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , put his other hand around my side , quickly whispered " hold on tight and get on your tiptoes " and twirled us both around . Sometime during this maneuver he stopped but continued to hold on to my hand , which he raised up above my head . I was still twirling . He continued my motion by gently pushing me as I came around . Although my twirling lasted only a few seconds , during the time I was actually experiencing it it seemed to last much longer . Finally , I stopped and lowered my hand and feet - to find myself a bit dizzy . I also noticed that everyone else in the club had stopped and was watching me and that the caller had also stopped speaking . <p> As soon as I - and the room - stopped spinning , everyone burst into applause . I was sure I had an embarrassed look on my face , but it quickly faded . I spoke and thanked everyone for indulging me . My partner asked me if I had enjoyed it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said it was his pleasure . The rest of the dance was uneventful . <p> It was a wonderful , magical event that I thought I would never again experience . I was wrong . <p> Not long after my dancing with the local gay and lesbian square dance club , their club president telephoned and asked if I would like to dress up again and dance at their upcoming anniversary dance . He said that the club members had really enjoyed having me because not only was I a good dancer , but also it was seldom that a dancer dressed in " traditional " womens square dance attire ever danced with them . <p> I told him that although flattered , I was n't sure this would be a good idea because I knew that square dance clubs anniversary dances traditionally have open invitations extended to all square dancers , regardless of gender or orientation , and I did n't  want to " out " myself should straight dancers from other clubs attend . After some additional discussion between the club president and myself ( other dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman since they would have never seen me dressed that way before and would n't be looking for me dressed that way now ; the reality was that few straight dancers accepted the open invitation from his club ; etc ) , I finally agreed . It was a decision I would come to appreciate all the more as time goes by . <p> The anniversary dance was held and I was there in my very best feminine square dance attire , including a brand new 100 yard petticoat I had purchased just for the occasion . I was also wearing an 80 yard petticoat , so I was extremely bouffant . I must confess that I was hugely enjoying the experience . <p> As soon as I walked through the door , I was again warmly greeted and it did n't  take long before I was being good-naturedly ribbed about my exaggerated appearance . I did n't  care . I was on a personal high and practically floating through the evening . <p> The dances were all fun and I had no difficulties in dancing the womens position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips , but I was clearly being sought out by others who also wanted to partner with me . Perhaps they just wanted to enjoy the sensation of feeling petticoats . I 'll never know for sure , of course , but I do know I could n't blame them . In any case , it was a fun but exhausting evening . I hardly had time to sit and catch my breath between dances . <p> As the evening wore on , my original partner came over and asked if I would like to be twirled again . I said I would . Even without music , we both knew what to do . He took my hand , I raised myself on to my toes , and we held each other as we quickly spun around . But then something different happened . A ( GG ) woman who was in our square ( who I had never previously met ) had been watching us . After my partner and I stopped , she spoke up and said I was spinning and twirling , but that my form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said the placement of my feet was all wrong . I asked her to explain and to show me what she meant . <p> We moved into an open area where we could move without being in the way of other dancers . She positioned herself next to me and attempted to show me how our feet should be placed so as to compliment each other . My petticoats were too bouffant and I could not see our feet , so I had the delightful necessity of crushing my petticoats against myself in order to see our feet . That was fun ! The woman knew what I was doing but did n't  seem to mind . Once our feet were in place , at her direction , we held each other as dancers and , pivoting against one another , twirled one another . Her movements seemed to flow easily while my own seemed slower and sluggish . I chalked it up to inexperience , but my new friend was having none of it . She insisted that the two of us keep at it until we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both performing the steps properly , but I did n't  seem to be getting any better . Neither of us could explain why . <p> Finally , she asked what type of shoes I was wearing . I showed her and immediately she spotted the problem . I was wearing shoes with a composition sole . The floor was polished wood . She asked if I had any hard soled dancing shoes . I told her I did , in the trunk of my car in the parking lot . I picked up my purse and she and I walked out to my car . I got my hard soled dancing shoes from the trunk , but then faced another situation . When I dress in petticoats , I usually put my shoes on and then step into and pull up my petticoats . Now , what to do ? I did n't  want to pull off my petticoats in the parking lot ; having them touch the dirty parking lot surface would soil the petticoats . The grease and oil stains would probably never come out . My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head , but I said that probably would n't work because it would pull my wig off . We finally hit upon a solution , which became another first for me . <p> I took my shoes with me , closed the trunk , and my friend and I visited the ladies restroom . The ladies restroom actually consisted of two rooms : An " outer " room which had a couch , some mirrors and a vanity for purses ; and an " inner " room which had the usual stalls and sinks . My friend and I stayed in the " outer " room , where I pulled down and stepped out of my petticoats , set them on a portion of the couch , then sat on another portion of the couch and changed my shoes . Once changed , I again stepped into my petticoats , pulled them up , and adjusted myself in the mirror . I picked up my purse and shoes and my friend and I returned to the dance floor . <p> As soon as I stepped on to the wooden floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took up our by-now familiar positions and twirled one another . We worked perfectly together ! At one point I was concerned that , because I was a male and probably much stronger physically , I might inadvertently send my friend spinning away , out of control , unless I really held on to her . I mentioned this to my friend . She suggested that if we were twirling each other properly , we would have no problems and I should n't worry about her " flying away into space . " So I stopped worrying and we both had a great time ! <p> The slowness and sluggishness I had been experiencing had been due to the composition sole of my shoes against the hard wood flooring . With my now wearing hard soled shoes , I was really moving . We were both enjoying ourselves and our twirling a lot more ! <p> Soon enough we were back dancing in a regular square . Eventually the evening came to its normal conclusion . It had been an incredible evening and one I will always fondly recall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel " to be wearing a petticoat while twirling ?

As I move my legs and twist my body to and fro , or when I touch my petticoat with my hands or some other portion of my body , I come into contact with my petticoats and can feel them . What wonderful feelings and sensations ! When I 'm twirling , however , aerodynamic forces cause my petticoats to rise up and away from me until the only portion of the petticoats physically in contact with my body is the waistband and perhaps a bit of the yoke ( uppermost portion of the petticoat ) .

@@37517524 @6517524/ <h> MOMMY 'S LITTLE GIRL <p> Betsy had had quite enough of pleasing other people , especially her ex-husband . He had left her for another woman , which was bad enough . Betsy thought he showed a poverty of original thinking when it turned out to be his secretary . In any case , she was very glad her father gave her a sizeable amount of blue chip stock before he died . At least that provided her with a substantial income , even if it did n't  warm her bed . The marriage had n't  provided her with real love or something else she had always wanted . Even before she had ever met her husband , she had looked forward to the day when she would be the proud mother of a pretty little girl . Instead he had left her with a twelve year old boy to raise by herself . But that was about to change . <p> Men always wanted a son when they got married to perpetuate themselves into the future even after the father died . A boy that would grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was alive ! Betsy was about to take steps to insure it would never happen ! And since her son was just starting his 1953 summer vacation , it was the ideal time to begin changing her little boy into something that would both fulfill her desire to have a little girl , and serve as the supreme thwarting of her ex-husbands wish : her little boy was about to become a sissy ! What else would you call a boy that acted and dressed like a nice little girl ? Of course he had no idea what was in store for him . But she was determined that he would be wearing a dress and learning to act like a nice little girl before the day was over ! <p> His name was the same as his fathers ... Edward . That would be the first thing shed change . And it certainly would n't become Edweena , Edwina or Edna . She decided his name would be the same as hers , Elizabeth .

" He came in and sat down on the couch next to her . She smiled down at him . He was a small for his age at four feet , five inches . <p> " What are we going to do Mom ? " he asked . <p> " Were going to go shopping , dear , and itll be lots of fun . But before we do that , I 'm taking you to a beauty parlor to get your hair done .

" <p> It did n't  take long for them to get to FRANCINES , a beauty parlor . Betsy parked the car and when they got out she took his hand again . Francine saw them coming in and smiled at Betsy . She had told Francine her plans concerning Beth over the phone earlier . Betsy marched Beth down to where Francine was waiting for them . Several ladies were sitting under dryers . <p> " Well !

" Afterwards , I 'm taking him shopping for his new clothes . I can hardly wait to put him in petticoats and dresses ! Of course dressing him nice and pretty is only the first step . Hell have to learn how to behave like a nice girl , too . By the way , his name is Beth now . " <p> " Oh , I 'm sure hell be a good girl once he sees how nice it is , " said Francine .

" I did n't  let him get a haircut since last September . Ive been planning this for quite a while . Do you think you might be able to put it into a ponytail and bangs ? I 'd love to see him with his hair like most of the girls nowadays . " <p> " I think we can do that , " said Francine . She picked up a card with three different colored pairs of plastic barrettes on it that she sold . " These and a few hair pins Will help to keep any short hair in place . " <p> Meanwhile " Beth " was terrified ! Francine saw the look on his face . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll look nice and pretty when we finish . " That was exactly what he was afraid of ! She began to comb his hair back to see just how long it was . Soon she stripped his hair of its brown color and then dyed it as he sat with his head over a sink . Afterwards he sat under a dryer for a while , and Betsy painted his nails a pink color that would look nice with his blond hair . Then he got back into a styling chair again . Francine worked quickly and skillfully , and soon his hair was tied up in a five inch ponytail with a pretty pink ribbon bow . Cute bangs hung down almost to his eyebrows that Francine judiciously plucked and drew with an eyebrow pencil . Taking a mascara tube from her own pocketbook , she lengthened and thickened his lashes . Next came some blush for his cheeks , and then she showed him how to roll his lips together to coat them evenly with a pink lipstick . Finally she was done and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was shocked when he saw himself ! He began crying a little .

" She touched up his mascara . <p> " Francine , you 're a marvel ! " said Betsy . " He looks much better than I even hoped for ! " <p> " Yes , hell make a darling little girl now once you 've dressed him up nice and pretty , " said Francine . " I wish I could go shopping for him with you . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Betsy . " But we do have to go shopping now so I 'll have enough time before the store closes . There 's so much I have to get for him .

" Soon you 're going to be wearing the prettiest dresses in town . " <p> Beth was terrified again . Inside there were mannequins of girls wearing pretty dresses , rows of big racks with petticoats and bouffant slips hanging on them , and table top bins with loose different colored panties in them .

" Are n't  these a lot nicer than boys underpants ? Youll be wearing a lot of them from now on . " <p> Beth felt so embarrassed ! Other salesladies had over-heard Betsys opening conversation , and soon he became the center of attention in the store as they came closer to see him . They whispered to each other with big smiles .

" <p> " Its still cool enough now for the poufy slips , " said Betsy . <p> " Later I 'll get him some of the waist high petticoats and some camisoles .

She slipped a tape measure around his chest and took his measurement . Then she placed a package of three training bras on top of the counter . <p> They moved along to a display of anklet socks that were trimmed with lace collars to fold down over his shoes . Betsy picked out eight pairs of them in several colors to match the dresses hed be wearing . She took some plain white ones too .

" We have some darling party dresses . " <p> " Perhaps later I 'll get him a party dress , " said Betsy . " But his birthday is n't til September . For now just some pretty dresses for everyday wear , and perhaps a couple of especially pretty ones for company and Sundays . " <p> Soon Mrs. Burness had helped Betsy to pick out nine dresses for him . She showed Betsy where the dressing rooms were so she could try them on him . Since they were all the same size , he would only need to try on one of them . When she had him in some panties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him out to the three-sided mirror .

Now he really thought it was the end of the world ! He knew shed tell all her friends about seeing him dressed like a girl . <p> " Look darling ! " said Betsy . " That pretty little girl seems to know you ! Let 's go over to her and her mommy and we can say hello to them . " She held his hand as they walked towards them . <p> " Hi Eddie ! " said Nancy .

It had short puffed sleeves with white trim on them , and a cute white secretary collar . About an inch of the same white lace hung from under the hem of their dresses . It buttoned up in the back .

@@37517525 @6517525/ <p> In this section I give methods that rely on hand sewing . BE CAREFUL ! Sewing needles and other equipment such as scissors and pins are sharp . Cuts and needle wounds can have serious consequences Proceed at Your Own RISK ! If you feel like you are working too hard and need a break , then chill out and play foxy bingo or whatever you do to relax . This is very important as you do not want to be getting tired and making mistakes . <p> The most common problem I come across is a seam coming apart . This sort of thing is shown in figure 2 as it would appear looking down onto an overcast kind of seam . In this kind of seam the thread that sews the seam together also gathers the edges of material in the seam into a bundle . Overcast seams are common in petticoats and other lingerie . <p> Figure 2A is looking at the opening in the seam from the edge . The seam is on the right side . The cloth that tore away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turned up a little ready to be sewn back to the seam . Be careful not to overlap the torn cloth onto the seam to much , as pulling the cloth back into the seam shortens the garment . If you use just a little to rejoin the seam it probably wont be noticeable . If you pull a lot of cloth into the seam as you sew it back you may be able to see the garment is shorter in the place under where you sewed the seam back together . Also as you sew the cloth back to the seam start sewing on the seam just a short distance before the tear in the seam . As you 're finishing the sewing , sew a short distance beyond the end of the tear . This will help keep the seam from coming apart again starting from one end of the tear . <p> Figure 2B shows starting to sew the seam back together using a plain hand sewing needle and thread . The dot at the end of the thread is the Knot you tie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the eye of the needle . When the thread is threaded through the needle and knotted at the end the double thread should be about three times as long as the tear . I 'd rather have a little thread left over than run out before I 'm done . If the tear is very long , working with thread three time as long would be to hard . In this case use a length of thread you feel comfortable working with . Sew as far as it will take you , tie the thread off , and start over with more thread . This way you can treat a long tear like several short ones in a row . I 've never used a sewing machine to do this because I do n't think this machine can do overcastting , or at least I do n't know how to do it . <p> Figure 2C shows how to sew the overcast . After you have passed the needle through the torn edge and the seam pull the thread through until the knot is against the cloth . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sew another stitch from the same direction you started the first stitch . This will result in a loop of thread over the edge of the seam . Keep doing this putting your stitches in at about 10 or 12 stitches to the inch of seam you 're sewing . <p> Figure 2D shows how the seam will look along its length . Note how the thread loops over the edge of the seam for each stitch . The thread slants a little since each stitch is down the seam a little from the last one . As you sew the stitches be careful not to pull the stitches to tight or leave them to loose . I try to keep my sewing so the seam is only slightly larger than the original . The slightly larger is because of the new layer of cloth that 's being added to the seam . <p> Figures 3 and 4 show a tear in the fabric of a garment . In the first case the material is completely gone and in the other the material is still present . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the main part of the cloth by sewing loops between the edges as shown in Figure 4A ( below ) . Do this only at places where the edges meet and keep your sewing close to the edges so you do n't gather a lot of material into the sewing . If you gather to much material into the sewing you will make a wrinkle in the cloth . Remember to tie off the thread at the end of your sewing to secure the thread . Now you 're at a point where you treat either the Figure 3 or 4 case the same way from here on . A patch needs to be applied . Yes , a patch is needed even in the case of Figure 4 . The sewing you just did has little strength and will tear again easily . You can patch the tear with a piece of material like that in the garment . This will probably mean a trip to the store and finding something that matches exactly will be hard . Even after all that effort of finding the material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patch . I found an alternative that looks much better and even gives you a chance to make you garment special . Most sewing and craft stores sell appliques . These are pieces of cloth cut to a specific shape like a heart , poodle , angle , etc , etc . These are usually made fancy with embroidery , felt , lace , or ribbon .

@@37517528 @6517528/ <p> A few weeks ago I went to the Manchester ( England ) Mardi Gras , and made a few new friends : Miriam , Nina , Jim and Martin . Miriam is bi-sexual , Nina is a pre-op trans-sexual and Jim and Martin are a gay couple . Jim and Martin said that they were getting married to each other and invited me to the wedding . For those who are n't familiar with gay marriages , they are n't recognised by UK law , so it is more of a statement of commitment between two people . Another thing to understand is that the stereotypical image of gay relationships is that there is a ' male ' and ' female ' , but this is not always true . In this case Jim and Martin are both men who are attracted to each other . When I was invited to the wedding , I jokingly said that I 'd wear one of my pretty dresses and be a flower girl . I was a little shocked when Martin told me I could wear what I wanted ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? It was a marvelous opportunity but I 'm very shy at dressing in front of other people for the first time , not only other people but the guests that would be going too . I remembered reading about someone who was given a similar opportunity to be a bridesmaid but had n't done it because they were purging themselves at the time but now regret it . I did n't want to make a similar mistake , but I also did n't want to embarrass myself either ! Over the next few weeks I decided I would wear a dress to the wedding , but it would depend on a few things . It was possible that a television crew from Channel 5 was going to film the wedding . I really did n't want to be on the telly , just my luck , one of the dodgy people in my block of flats would just happen to see it and make my life hell ! And the ex-wife and kids of Martin might be coming too . Dressing like a little girl in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Right up to the morning I was going I really did n't know what was happening So I decided to I was going to take my girly things anyway : black Mary Jane 's , white frilly anklets , white patterned tights , white pettipants , 2 petticoats , a pettislip , blonde wig , white hairbow and the new white dress I 'd made . It is white satin with a very wide collar that goes right around my neck with lace around the edge , puffed sleeves with lace on the cuffs , a full , fingertip length skirt with lace ruffles on the hem , a wide white sash around my middle . I even took my favourite Teddy Bear , Harry , with me . I put them all in my bag and went into Manchester in my grey casual suit and teal T-shirt . <p> The ceremony was very nice and un-gendered , centring on love . There was an interesting symbolism using three candles : two small candles , and a bigger candle in the middle . The burning outside candles were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large candle to symbolise their union and blew out the smaller ones . After the photo session we all walked the one and a half mile walk to the Shakespeare pub in the city centre where the reception was held in the private function rooms upstairs . There was a marvelous buffet and plenty to drink and some good conversation , where I told several people who I was and about my dressing up too . No-one cared since they were all friends with gay people , so it was n't anything really different anyway . Okay it was quite hard to make people understand that my dressing is n't a sexual stimulant for me , but I made my case well . About an hour after , I ended chatting with a girl called Kate . She was 16 years old and very understanding . I told her about me and that I had my dress in my bag . She asked if I would show it to her and I took it out for her to see . She loved it and held it up against her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room with it and floated back to me asking if she could try it on . I said , " Yes , of course you can . " And after a few minutes she came out of the toilet wearing my flower girl dress . She looked glorious ! Her shapely legs dancing as she twirled around the floor again . It was a little too big for her , but the sash took care of that . She went and showed her mother , Eva , who loved it too . They whispered something to each other and Kate went to take it off again and put back on her long glittery black dress . While that was happening I explained more about myself to Eva . She was fascinated , and when Kate emerged again , the two of them insisted that I put it on for them . I was reluctant . As I said before , I 'm very nervous at wearing a dress in front of new people . In fact , up until that point , I had only dresses at home or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as me . Eva held my dress and stood very close , right in front of me saying something like , " Would n't you really love to wear this pretty dress for us ? Would n't you look soooo pretty in it ? ? ! " She was really quite hypnotic ! ! How could I resist ? ! ! I must have turned 10 shades of red , but I caved in and headed to the toilets and changed . <p> My dress has ten buttons on the back , and although I can do the up by myself , it is quite hard and takes me about five minutes . I must admit that I do like to have someone to fasten my buttons for me , so this , and the time to do it for myself , made me decide to leave them undone and get someone to help me . When I got back outside , I mentioned that I needed some help and there was a momentary quarrel between mother and daughter over who would assist me . I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly buttoned me up and pulled the sash tightly around my high waist and tied it into a pretty bow that the back . <p> <p> From that moment it was a bit of a blur ! Kate and Evan both kept circling me , looking at every bit of my outfit , from the bow in my hair to the Mary Jane 's on my feet to my petticoats and the laciness of my dress ! They kept hugging and kissing me and holding my hands , telling me how pretty I was and how much they loved it ! It was really amazing ! I was in heaven . It was beyond my wildest dreams ! Here were two people who I really did n't know , and they were treating my like a real little girl ! Can you imagine how I felt ? ? I really doubt it ! ! <p> I spent over 4 hours wearing my pretty white dress . Apart from an older lady who got a bit of a surprise when I entered the main room , and had a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and made a bit of a fuss over me . Jim and Martin were very pleased . They were delighted that I would make an effort to dress in front of them and see for themselves what I 'd described I was to them . I had a great time , dancing with Eva and Kate and getting lots of attention too , but eventually I had to get changed , and we all left to go to go home . <p> It was a marvelous experience to have !

It seemed he could n't really do anything that was fun . His mom made him take a bath and put on a clean shirt and school pants . Then she combed his hair and gave him a stern warning . <p> " Now you can go outside , but you better not get dirty , young man , or you wont be playing outside for a week . And be careful with your shoes , too . Keep them nice and shiny till Aunt Terri leaves . Absolutely no running . " <p> She was always doing this . Every time any company came he had to stay clean and wear school clothes . He could n't even wear his sneakers . But , gee ! This was Memorial Day ! His father wanted to take him fishing , but after the phone call from his aunt the other day , his mother told him he had to stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stick as he sat on the cellar bulkhead . Mac , his border collie , sat and looked up at him quizzically , wondering why they werent running down the path in the wood lot to the camp Billy and his pals had built . <p> Inside the house his mother was taking a pan of brownies out of the oven . It would be nice having her sister visit today . Actually they saw each other fairly often , but she had expected to be alone today since her husband was going fishing with a pal and had offered to take Billy with him . But when her sister had called to tell her she was coming over with a little present for her birthday , she said that it was important that Billy be there . She said she had something for him , too , but not to tell him that . It was a surprise . <p> She and her sister exchanged birthday presents . But other than that , and a present from her husband , Jim , she did n't  make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or presents from her other relatives . It just came and went like any other day . Still , it was sweet of Terri to be coming over and showing that she remembered her birthday with some little present . Susan began lifting the brownies out of the pan with a spatula and stacking them on a glass plate . <p> Just about ten oclock that morning , Aunt Terris Buick pulled into the driveway , and Mac recognized the sound of her car and ran over to it , his tail wagging rapidly . Billy looked up when he heard it and stood up . He began walking over towards it slowly . His aunt got out and straightened out her dress , brushing at her skirts which poufed out nicely from the petticoats under it . Then she opened the door to the back seat and took out a large , sort of flat package with a big ribbon and bow on it . <p> " Hi , Billy , " she called to him with a big smile .

" She smiled at him lovingly and they went in the back door to the kitchen . Billy stood there as his mother and aunt kissed each others cheeks and made hellos and began to walk slowly into the parlor . <p> " Smells like brownies , " said Aunt Terri . <p> " Yes , " said Susan , " and I just put on a pot of coffee . Itll be ready in a few minutes . Let 's sit down on the couch . " Billy followed along slowly , wondering how long she was going to stay .

More fun than this anyway . <p> He sat down in a big overstuffed chair , his feet not quite reaching the floor . <p> His tenth birthday had been only two months ago , and his father had given him a new fishing rod and reel . So far he had only used it twice . He wondered if dad had already caught some trout today . This was going to be a crummy day for him . It had that feeling about it . His mother and aunt chattered away about some wedding that they had gone to the other day while he was in school . Women and girls always talk about such boring stuff , he thought . He wished he could at least watch some television , but he knew his mother and aunt wanted to talk . <p> The two women , both rather pretty and just a couple of years apart in age , were in their mid-to-late thirties . They sat with their legs crossed , white petticoats peeking from under their dresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally his mother told him he could go back outside , but again warned him about not getting dirty . He almost ran out of the house and found Mac waiting for him at the back porch steps , tail wagging expectantly . <p> " Susan , do n't  get too excited by the size of the box , " said Terri . " It was a close-out sale at Schacters Department store . I really did n't  pay all that much for it . Happy birthday , Sis . " She leaned over and gave her sister a little peck on the cheek . <p> " Oh , Terri ! You shouldnt be doing this ! " Actually , she was somewhat excited and dying to find out what her sister had brought her . She untied the fancy bow and ribbon and slid the box out of the gift wrapping paper . Taking off the top of it , she could see two layers of tissue paper wrapped over a couple of items . She unwrapped the paper from the top one and lifted a pretty yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terri !

" She gave her sister a kiss on the cheek and looked back at the dress , her eyes shining . <p> " Ummtheres something else in the box , too , Susan , " said Terri . <p> " Yes , I thought there was.Let me see " She unwrapped the second item and held up a dress that was the same as the first one , but it was for a young girl . <p> " What is " she began , puzzled . <p> " It was a mother and daughter set , " explained Terri . " I had to buy both to get the one I wanted for you . At first I thought maybe you could give it to Mary Ferland across the street for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Susan . " Shed love it . " <p> " Suewhen I was buying it , I started thinking about doing something else with it , " said Terri . " It would be something fun to do today instead of just sitting here talking ourselves out and getting fat on your brownies . " She laughed good naturedly , and wondered what her sister would think of what she was about to say . <p> " Well , I 'm all for fun , " replied Susan . " What is it ? " <p> " Sis , " began Terri , " you know how you always hoped you 'd have a little girl . It must be a disappointment for you to have your only child be a boy . " <p> " Oh , well , " said Susan with a sigh , " I know I 'll never get everything I want in life . " <p> " Well , maybe just for this afternoon , you could have your daughter , " said Terri . " I bought a set that had the size dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for today . I think it would be so much fun . And we could take a few pictures of you and your " daughter " to keep in your family album . " <p> " Put Billy in a dress ? ! " said Susan , laughing a little . " Hed start World War III if I even mentioned the idea of it . " It was just like Terri to want to do something mischievous like this , she thought , still smiling at her . <p> " Oh , come on , Sue . We can make him do it , and itll be so much fun . We can bribe him with something.tell him well take him to the movies or something . I bet hed really look cute , too . " <p> Susan thought about the idea . It would be lots of fun , and something shed remember.having a daughter for a day ! Her own little girl ! <p> " Well , I do n't  want to embarrass him.but ..

" She got up and went out the back door . <p> Susan thought about what Billy would look like dressed as a girl . A smile appeared on her face and she went to the back door and called Billy . Leave it to Terri to think of something like this , she thought . Still , it probably would be a lot of fun . <p> Billy was looking in Macs ears for ticks . It was a noble duty all the boys did for their canine pals . His mom thought it was gross and probably involved exposure to all sorts of germs . Finished , he gave Macs head a friendly rough rub . Mac shook his head and ears vigorously , smiling at him like some dogs can . <p> Then he heard his mother calling him .

They were shiny pink with white lace around the leg openings and across the back of them . Ugh ! <p> Then his mother stepped close and patted him all over with some pretty smelling powder . It made him sneeze once and his mom apologized . <p> " What do you think , Susan ? " asked Terri . " Camisole and petticoat or a bouffant slip ?

Then he thought of the Swiss Army knife and , sighing , continued to let them dress him . <p> He looked down at his chest and where his legs usually were . There were shiny shoulder straps trimmed with lace and there was more lace and a little shiny bow on the top of it . The skirt of it went down to the top of his knees , but because of the way it poufed out , he could n't see his feet . It had three layers to it , and the inner layer was surprisingly smooth on his legs . And it was so pretty and girlish it made his stomach feel funny ! <p> " Susan , Memorial Day usually marks the beginning of summer fashion , so I got him some white Mary Janes , " said Terri . " Nice , are n't  they ? " <p> " Oh , yes , Terri ! " said his mother enthusiastically .

He also thought about how both of them had been calling him sweetheart , honey , and darling all morning long . Jeeezz ! <p> When his mother lifted the dress over his head , she told him to make sure his hands and arms went into the puffed sleeves as she pulled it down . His aunt fixed the dress over the skirt of the slip , brushing away some wrinkles as his mother began buttoning up the back of it . Then she took both ends of a wide white sash attached at the sides of his waist and pulled them tight and tied a big bow at the back of his waist . <p> His mother came around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister as both women looked critically at him . <p> " Hmmm , " said his mother .

And Billys was just as pretty ! <p> Then they sat him down in a chair and wrapped a folded bed sheet around him to keep the cut hair off his dress . While his aunt began to cut and shape his hair , his mother pulled a chair closer to him and sat down and began to paint his fingernails red . <p> He began to wonder if the Swiss Army knife was worth all this . <p> Finally both women were finished . His aunt used a hairpin to fix a pretty little yellow bow in his hair on the side of his head . <p> " Oh , yes , Terri ! " said his mother . " It matches his dress and looks so darling !

Both women also began to give him instructions : not swinging his arms when he walked , walking a little slower and taking slightly smaller steps , sitting up nice and straight and with his feet and knees together and his hands in his lap . And they told him to speak in a soft but clear voice , and not to use any slang . <p> " And do n't  you dare go for a pee standing up while you 're Mommys little girl or Mommy will have to spank you with the hair brush .

The lace hem of his slip showed a little below the dress , and the short puffed sleeves had white trim with little pink chenille bows . The little rounded white collar looked so dainty ! Some rows of little white rusching went across the bodice . The white sash encircled his waist tightly . But the skirt of the dress poufed out , just like the dresses the girls at school wore .

They turned towards her and there was a bright flash as she took a quick picture of them together . That began a series of pictures they wanted to take .

Then they did another one of the same pose , only with Billy and Mommy actually kissing this time .

I always thought you probably had a nice gentle side to you way down deep inside . Let 's go stand in front of the mirror again .

She knew some little boys were curious about girls , even to the point of wanting to know what it would be like to get dressed like one .

" asked Susan as she stood in back of him at the mirror again . He nodded his head , a smile on his face . " Mommy is so glad you like being her little girl , sweetheart . Well have lots of fun today . " <p> He was smiling again , now that he knew Mommy was n't upset . And she said that it was okay for him to like pretty things . Just then Mommy bent forward with an arm around both sides of him and lifted up the hem of his dress . <p> " And look how nice and pretty your slip is , darling , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow . Isnt it yummy , sweetheart ! " <p> " Yes , Mommy , " he replied . " Its pretty and makes a swishy noise when I walk , too . " She smiled at him and caressed his cheek .

" <p> He giggled at the idea and nodded his head , and his mother hugged him close to her . He could n't remember his Mommy hugging him so much before . <p> " Time for our gloves and purses , girls , " said Terri . " We do n't  want to miss the beginning of the movies . " 
@@37517530 @6517530/ <p> Like most everyone else , I was introduced to the heavenly world of feminine things at an early age . I was about five when I picked up a cousin 's doll at our Thanksgiving dinner party and felt the soft folds of a Nylon Tricot nightgown the doll was dressed in . That one episode triggered a lifelong fascination with Nylon Tricot and all the wonderful things made from it . <p> When we lived in Bethesda , Maryland in the early 60 's through the late 70 's , my bedroom was a converted and enclosed porch that opened off my parent 's bedroom so I had to go through their room to get to mine . This arrangement worked fine , as I was a sound sleeper . My two older sisters shared the master bedroom , as it was bigger . I was always on the lookout for soft feminine things Mom laid on the bed or had hanging in her closet . Of course , my teenage sisters had all kinds of fun stuff and I checked everything out whenever the opportunity arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightgown of sea foam green nylon with double sheer puff sleeves that was so buttery soft I STILL can remember the feeling of it . One night I decided to get brave and sneak it out of her closet , as she wore usually more conservative gowns that were not as " enticing " to Dad ; the fancy ones were reserved for " non-kid " nights . I slipped it on and felt incredible and decided to sleep in it and sneak it back in the closet in the morning . As I was quietly closing the closet door , I noticed a small area of lace hanging behind a dress in the closet . I brushed aside the dress and found a gorgeous petticoat made from soft nylon chiffon and slightly stiffer layers of organza . ( I now know the material names after years of learning and dressing and buying. ) ; the petticoat was dripping with ruffled lace and little ribbon bows . I knew Mom never wore these and was confused why it was there . I pulled it out and the tags were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , I figured it was a present for her . I know I should have never touched it , but the urge was so strong ! I pulled it out and took it with me to my room and decided to snuggle under it while wearing the nightgown . You all know that heavenly sensation when you are enveloped in tons of **27;0;TOOLONG ( My word coined by an ex-wife for my collection of petticoats and nightgowns . ) . Needless to say I hard a " hard " time ( difficult ) getting to sleep but finally did . <p> In the morning , Dad was already in the bathroom shaving and Mom was in the kitchen . I quietly got up and put the petticoat back in the closet and folded mom 's nightgown and put in in her dresser drawer . Everything was fine until I got home from school . Mom was sitting on my bed and told me she had a question for me . I thought nothing unusual was afoot until she asked me how her nightgown got from a hanger in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As kids do , I denied any knowledge and tried to make a fuss about such a strange question . " Do I look like I wear girls ' clothes ? " It did n't work . She kept after me until I broke and said I just wanted to feel what girls clothes were like , as they looked so different . She then got up and walked to the closet and brushed aside the clothes hanging in there to uncover the petticoat . She pulled it out and said , " It seems you have been rather active in here young man " I had not noticed , but when I slept under the petticoat I had accidentally torn off a tag and creased another . That was a dead giveaway . <p> She said that had better be the last time or else . -Insert all the usual assurances and promises here- She said , " I am not kidding either . " Weeks go by but I can not get that heavenly feeling out of my mind . <p> One day while walking to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the window : The Teen Scene by Dorothy . They are still setting up , but there are a couple dresses in the widow and there is a sign maker installing a small explanatory sign about the scope of the store . " Teen Dresses , Prom and Pageant Gowns , Formals , Lingerie for the Young Lady , Sleepwear , and Accessories " and the tag line : " We can turn any girl into a princess . " Needless to say this store caught my attention daily as I walked by to and from school ; this weakness of mine for window shopping was my downfall . <p> After weeks of slowly cruising by and trying to be " unnoticed , " I came up with a plan . I would use my savings and allowance and buy my own nightie and Mom would never know . One day , with about $60.00 in my pocket , I wandered in and approached one of the three salesladies and delivered a detailed story of how I wanted to buy my sister a really pretty nightgown for her birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple that were kind of plain . I saw the one I wanted and it was gorgeous and super frilly ; adding details to my story that she was all " girly " and loved fancy lacey things trying to direct her to the one I wanted . She finally took the hint and completed the sale and wrapped it in a nice box . <p> Here is the funny part . Being a typical ( ? ) kid I never thought I made much of an impression on anyone in the store . However they evidently noticed me slowing or stopping EVERY DAY as I walked by to gaze at the dresses , etc in the window . I know now that they must have put two and two together early on . <p> My next genius move was to go in again in another month or so with another story about a cousin 's birthday ( sound familiar ? ) . Repeat the whole scene . At the register , after I paid my hard earned money , all three salesladies were standing there when the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with these when you are done " Color my face beet red and listen to me stammer denials and anything that would get me off the hook . She told me they had seen me almost every day standing at the window or looking in the open door . She said they had known from day one I was lying and that these were for me . She said she gets men all the time with the same story and she was tired of being lied to . <p> " Why ca n't you just tell me the truth and say they are for you ? " Since I was caught , I just sort of mumbled that I was embarrassed . She then told me all three ladies were sisters and they had a brother who did the same thing , so they did understand . <p> The next thing she said was heaven to my ears . She asked if I had any kind of job like mowing lawns , etc . I said I had a paper route that ran only on Wednesday and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long I had saved to get the $60.00 for my first purchase . She said she would make me a deal . I could work for her after school opening boxes and stocking the place as well as sweeping , etc. and she would not only pay me but as part of my pay she would add up time spent and credit it towards a new outfit . My first day in after school she asked me what I liked to wear . I told her I loved nightgowns and petticoats , I was in luck- she sold both . She led me to a rack of what looked like heaven on hangers- about 15 feet of gown after gown after gown . Next was a long rack of full slips , half slips and , at the end and onto another rack , a huge assortment of petticoats for long formals , cocktail length dresses and the cutest were pre-teen pageant petticoats . She also contracted with a store two doors down that was a bridal salon , providing lingerie and bridal petticoats , and did alterations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a regular short gown , but she explained it was a three piece babydoll . I had never seen anything so beautiful . It was baby pink and the two sheer layers of the gown were extremely full cut over the third opaque layer . There was a matching robe of sheer nylon ( 3 layers ) with big puff sleeves and a pom pom-tipped ribbon tie . <p> The piece de resistance was a pair of extremely frilly full cut panties . Now comes the shocker . She said I was to stay in the back room and open the boxes laid out and unpack them and , as a treat , she would let me wear the outfit I was going to earn . She told me to go into the bathroom and wait . In about five minutes , she knocked on the door and said she had everything I needed . I cracked the door open and she handed me that beautiful babydoll , along with two pairs of panties . She said she knew what boys sometimes did when they wore things like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nylon panties , but larger than I needed , so they were a little loose . She said the second pair was special : They were sanitary plastic lined panties . I had never seen these before . She just said that young teen girls frequently wore them- no other explanation . Over these went the babydoll panties , then the gown and finally the robe . You can not believe the feelings I had when I was all dressed . Every nerve was firing and I knew I was in heaven . She told me to step out so they could get a good look . I nervously did and she said I looked adorable . That was the end of the sweet attitude on their part . Now I was to get to work . Let me tell you , prancing around in that outfit unpacking bridal petticoats was something I will always remember . <p> Things progressed nicely , and I was getting richer ( so far , about $100 ) and had acquired enough time credits to get my nightie to take home . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in cash , my money was placed in a small envelope with the name and address of the store on it . I had taken them home to empty out and just tossed the envelopes . One day , Mom found an envelope on my dresser that I had not emptied out . As I found out later , she called the store asking why I had these envelopes and about the money . The store salesladies explained it ALL to her . On the Friday I was to get my nightie to sneak home , at 5:00 PM in walks my Mom . I heard the owner talking quietly to someone but could not hear what was being said . She called to me to pick up a petticoat from the reserved rack and bring it out , as there was no one there but the three salesladies . When I pranced out hugging the petticoat against me I almost passed out . Mom was standing there staring at me , and she had my two sisters with her . Words would not come ; my knees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories I had used and the way I loved handling and trying on all the gowns and petticoats and slips and learning all the terms for the different lingerie . My sisters were hysterically laughing . <p> Mom just looked at me and asked how I liked the job . She asked again and I finally stammered out that I liked it and the owner said I was quite helpful to her . Mom asked her if I always wore nighties to work in and the owner said I preferred them , but sometime she had me wear a pageant petticoat just for fun , but that I was ALWAYS demurely dressed in multiple panties . Mom just looked at me and finally said that since I was a good employee and was earning money she was OK with the job . <p> As it was now about 6:30 PM and we had not eaten , I was getting hungry . Mom told us to get in the car and we would get something at a drive in . I started to pick up my clothes and head to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give my clothes to my sister and mom told her to put them in the trunk . <p> Mom said , " Oh no , my little girl gets to wear her pretty new nightie to dinner and then home . " No amount of pleading changed her mind , and the owner said she had a small present for me . She handed me a pair a pink high heel mules with little pompoms to match the gown to wear , since boys ' shoes would not match the outfit . So out the front door and down the sidewalk I had to walk about 50 feet to the car amid a lot of laughs and cat calls from passersby , and off we went to a Hot Shoppes drive-in , where I was easily seen by the car hop and another car 's occupants . Lots of laughter and ideas from my sisters about outfits and ways to teach me lessons about dressing up . We ate and then drove home , and I was instructed to go to bed in the babydoll and to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed Mom had laid out three new pairs of panties that I believe were my sisters ' . <p> Mom called the store at 9:00AM and asked if they wanted me back today , and they said sure . So she drove me back to the store IN MY BABYDOLL and left me there with no other clothes to work the entire day . She sent my sister , who had just gotten her driver 's license , to pick me up at 5:00 . I was allowed to bring my next earned purchase- a teen girls formal petticoat with a beautiful bodice of tiny ruffled lace rows and a very full skirt of tiered and gathered organza and lace . Naturally , sisters being prone to teasing , she drove all over town and down all the side streets in the hopes of displaying me to anyone she could . <p> So after Mom sort of accepted my predilection for frillies , I was allowed to collect more nighties , and started a large collection of every type and length of petticoat . She even bought me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . After all these years I still get frillies from my sisters and Mom . Dad knows , but he has just accepted that I am a little goofy and , as long as I hurt anyone , it is OK to play dress up . It does look a bit unusual though when we get together : I am sitting amid a mass of lace and ribbon trimmed petticoats ( usually at least 200 yards ) under a super frilly girly girly dress with ribbons in my hair and my mom and sisters are there in jeans and sweats . It is all the more unusual , as I am not the smallest guy in the world . I am losing weight though and toning up after years of indulging in culinary pleasures alongside petticoat pleasures . Currently , although I can now wear off the rack sizes , none are frilly enough so I have a few seamstresses and Mom has two that she contracts with for my special outfits <p> I have now converted one bedroom to a lingerie storage and display room . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted me and gifted me with the most feminine items you can imagine , many are custom made and are more frilly than any woman or girl would ever wear today . I even jokingly told my sisters one day , as we watched a commercial for prepaid funerals , that I wanted to be buried in a nightgown and laid on a full super frilly petticoat . That said they promise it would be . <p> NOTE : Yesterday I got a small package from a neighbor who knows all about me . It was a bottle of Sunflower perfume . She put in a note that said when she smelled it all she could see was me in all my petticoats and finery , spritzing myself all over . Let me tell you girls , there is something about this perfume that just screams SISSY . It is an overwhelming feeling being dressed and smelling this heavenly scent wafting up from the layers of petticoats .

@@37517535 @6517535/ <p> Like so many others on Petticoat Pond - which I love and almost visit daily ( can not do without my petti fix ) - I took and interest in things soft and silky from an early age . I was five and had a girl friend of 3 who wore lovely nylon panties edged with lace which she showed me on request . I remember wanting to put them on myself but her mum stopped that . I always got turned on by the sight of a flash of petticoat or lace just peeping out from a skirt - preferably pleated . I enjoyed these sights whenever I encountered them but gradually , I did n't just want to admire them , I wanted to wear them and to see how they felt . <p> On lunch time 20 odd years ago I found a discarded petticoat lying in the road . I came over all unnecessary at the though that I might get it . Making sure no one was actually looking , I swooped upon it like an eagle , stuffed it in my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't wait to try it on . Sadly , it had belonged to a teenage girl , so it was a bit tight , but it had a very sexy lower panel that billowed out when twirling . How I enjoyed that moment . Suddenly there was an explosion of buying panties and waist petticoats which I stuffed down my trousers , tights . Once bought , I could n't wait to get back ; I headed for the nearest toilets and changed there . Oh the relief and the lovely feel of softness around my legs and lower regions . Soon I was always looking for new items then I felt guilty , eventually threw them away and thought that was that . But it was n't . Some time later , the desire to wear women 's underwear returned and I was too weak to resist . This cycle of buying , enjoying and discarding went on for a few years . Carelessly , my wife discovered some petticoats hidden in a box in the cellar - where I thought they were safe . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This shook me a bit , so I left dressing alone for quite a while but the desire came back again . This time I was more careful . I would dress on most occasions that presented themselves but mostly under my own clothes but the sensation was lovely and enjoyable . <p> Gradually , I came to admire not only women in nice appealing clothes but I had the urge to want to wear them too . Why should all the women have all the nice things in life to wear ? The lure of high heels , skirts and most of all dresses started to impact on me . I just loved the excitement of choosing a new petticoat and feeling the back of my hand brushing up against the other petticoats on display . I usually bought things when I was dressed underneath as this motivated me . " I 'm a girl " I told myself , " why should I be embarrassed to buy these lovely items " The adrenalin rush when offering the garments to be wrapped and the shaky hand in exchanging money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . Over the years the more I wore them they almost became a normal part of my life . I bought other things like Teddies , bras , French knickers - always had to be shiny and silky to win my appeal . <p> Then I came on-line in 1998 and out of curiosity entered " petticoats " in the search engine . It was then I discovered Petticoat Pond and have not looked back . It was here I discovered that the bouffant styles of layered petticoats where still around and there were people who liked - even loved them . This fired my enthusiasm and interest , because ever since the 50 's ( and I 'm getting near 60 now ) , I have been turned on by the sight of frilly bouffant petticoats . How I envied girls for whom it was acceptable to wear them - but now hardly ever do . Well , if the real girls wo n't wear them then we Poufies will - and enjoy them to the max . Just the sight of them makes me go - aaahh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream to have one and wear it is now becoming a reality now that I know some sources . <p> Just recently , I was " discovered " when my wife came back rather earlier than expected and in my haste to get back to normal , I had to cover some of the garments I was wearing . I could n't pretend any longer . What a relief to know my secret was out , although my wife had been suspicious in earlier times , but she was relieved to know that the " other woman " was my alter ego . We have talked about it ad nauseam since then . She was naturally shocked but took a sympathetic view . Like most women , she can not understand the buzz we get from it and feels the things we like are just outside her sphere . She does n't want to see me dressed , but has even volunteered to do my washing and mended a petticoat whose strap had become detached . She has contacted a support group here and has researched the phenomenon in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has even suggested that I link with a CD club . She declared me a transvestite - a term I have denied all along . I have been in denial of my dressing all these years but now I have owned up to the fact that I am one of you . I am so glad I am not the only one . Perhaps I can now buy things without having to sneak them in unnoticed and worry about where to hide them . I have written for her a 14 page paper of my history in dressing and my accompanying thoughts to help her understand me a bit better and for me it was a therapy . I can now see the trend of wanting to dress all through my life with , at times , significant gaps . <p> I am at the point where she will read this document . I have made much emphasis on a life-long desire for a bouffant petticoat and a full skirt to wear over the top and I showed her the web sites where they can be obtained . Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or should it be , ' girl ' ) , I will be on to the web site right away to order one ! I just dream of having all those layers of chiffon swirling around my legs and sexily visible under my skirt . My other desires are for a bridal dress and those white or pink satin dresses with puff sleeves and full skirts to wear my pettis underneath - oh what heaven , what bliss that will be . The ultimate in femininity . I also quite like the " little girl " look with loads of pettis and white socks - mmm , very sexy and I adore UniKaren 's pages . Perhaps , I will progress to wigs and make up and then going out en femme to express the feminine side of me . At times I feel very feminine and love girlie things and the expression of this is gradually taking shape . I want to go into shops unembarrassed to ask for a dress - as I have done twice before - which makes a statement - " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am strictly heterosexual and have no desire to go all the way to be a woman , but I just love getting as close as I can get .

I feel almost depressed when I have to change out of the few clothes I have back into boring old male clothes . I only wish I could dress for hours at a time and enjoy that sensuous feel of silk , satin and nylon cosseting my body . Well , that 's where I 'm at and reading the stories on the web site has made me feel a great sense of belonging to the Poufbunny world .

I was frightened and suddenly so ashamed of myself ! I remember looking at her with tears streaming down my cheeks and frozen in place ! She slowly came up the stairs and sat on one of the steps next to me . All I remember after that was her hugging me as we both sat next to each other on the stairs .

I knew she must have talked to Dad about what she found me doing the day before , but again nothing ! Mom and I had already talked a lot those two days . During one of those talks she told me she suspected I kind of liked girls clothes even before she saw me doing it .

Why was I so horribly strange ? Wouldnt they be better off without some freak like me around ?

@@37517540 @6517540/ <h> OUR TWENTIETH-EIGHTH PINUP ! <p> My first memory , evidently circa 1956 , is of standing swaddled in several petticoats hanging in my mother 's closet . I was enveloped in softness . Later , at four , uninterested in a mandatory afternoon nap , I used to take my mother 's quilted satin bedspread and wear it as a gown , pretending to strut about the " court " of the bed as a queen .

As I developed my own wardrobe , I came across the image of the classic French maid . I was smitten ! <p> How sexy , how coquettish . The full and partially revealed bust , the tightly corseted waist , the very full skirt with petticoats surely to be displayed , with stocking tops and garters also designed for viewing ! Plenty of frou-frou in delicate lace cuffs , matching lace collar , frilly cap , sheer and frilly apron - all so adorably sweet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high spiked heels clicking , her apron sliding atop the uniform , her nylon stockings kissing with each step .

But they do take up room , and my wife is always trying to keep me from taking over the house with all the frou-frou ! Still , I am eager to find more dresses to accommodate the petticoats . I love the daytime dresses of the 50 's , more modern cocktail dresses with full skirts , and some of the square dance dress fashions . Of course , the French maid uniform is my all-time passion , and I am always eager to serve any lady who appreciates classic femininity , especially if she is as enthralled by petticoats as I am.

@@37517545 @6517545/ <p> ANNA 'S FIRST ENCOUNTER -- how her bother and a kindly saleslady helped open the door ! <p> My first time . Wow -- that seems so long ago . In some ways though , I 'll never forget it . I was about 13 years old when I happened to stumble upon my brother , pulling on a pair of women 's underwear . I was so shocked , I did n't say a word and he did n't notice me at first . When he finally turned around to head down the stairs , he saw me . At first he was embarrassed . Then he threatened to hurt me if I ever told anyone . I never did ( until now ) . A few nights later before , we lay down to go to bed , I asked him why he liked them . It was more of a question than a criticism . He decided that I was being curious and that he could trust me , so he told me that he loved the soft silky feel . <p> For years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women around me and the soft clothes they often wore . I figured it was a privilege of their sex and did n't really think about it other than that . I was envious in some small hidden way , but there was nothing I could do about it . I was born a boy . <p> A few weeks later , while my brother was out , I searched his room and found where he kept his pretty things . Much to my surprise , there were much more than just panties . He had bras , slips , and lingerie . I touched each and every one of them , brushing my face and body with them . That was the last straw -- I was hooked . There was no denying it anymore . I wanted to be dressed in soft silky clothes . <p> Well , my brother came home and got upset that I got into his " stuff " . After he had calmed down , he asked why I was interested in his " stuff " . I admitted I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my own and leave his stuff alone . I asked where he got it and he admitted he bought them from a store across town , saying they were for his girlfriend ( though I 'm sure the saleslady knew better ) . As I was only 13 , this option was not open to me . I had been foiled again . <p> A few more weeks passed , during which I found myself constantly thinking of getting dressed up . Then something occurred to me : There were plenty of used clothing stores in the area . I started scouting them out . I was determined that I 'd feel everything , but I 'd only get dressed in the softest , most feminine materials . I picked a multi layered ( 3 or maybe 4 layers ) petticoat and the rest of the undergarments , as well as a pretty blue dress . <p> When I found the perfect dress , I had to work up my courage to ask the saleslady how much the petticoats and other garments were . It did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties and extremely attractive . When I finally did work up the courage , the saleslady told me it was for young ladies , not boys , and if I was purchasing something as a surprise for my mother I should find out her size ( I had selected garments of two different sizes ) . I got upset . I wanted to feel that material . It was obvious to the saleslady by this point what was going on . Bless her heart though , when she realized what was going on , she said that " All sales are final , so perhaps you should try the garments on . " She then escorted me back to a large back room off limits to customers where I could change , and even brought me what she estimated were proper fitting garments . To save me the embarrassment of being caught , she even carried the clothes back herself . I was so grateful I almost cried . <p> When she left me alone , I stripped , naked eager to feel the soft clothing . When I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever felt . The problem was , I 'd gotten on the frilly panties and even managed to put on the petticoats , but I could n't figure out how a woman got her bra on ( never occurred to me that a woman would n't put it on the way it was worn ) . At about this point the saleslady , Karen , came back to check on me . She smiled when I told her I could n't figure out how to get fully dressed . She told me she was closing the store in about ten minutes and if I did n't mind waiting , she would help me . <p> I waited the ten minutes , grateful for the help and eager to complete the transition . She came back and helped me put on the bra . Then she showed me how to remove it and put it on by myself , and gave me several other tips on getting dressed . " I ca n't be there to help you every time you get dressed . " Karen joked . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , she asked if I wanted to complete the look with makeup . Since she knew my secret , I figured there was no harm at this point . So I told her yes . <p> She left me for a moment to get her makeup case . When she left , I discovered that I had been so aroused by the feeling of the clothes that I 'd dribbled a little pre-orgasm in my panties . I quickly changed and Karen came back just as I was changing . She asked why I changed , and I sheepishly admitted that I 'd gotten overly excited . She reassured me it was ok and asked if she should leave me alone to " finish " . I declined , as I was too eager to see the makeup . <p> She slowly applied makeup to my face and took care of my rough nails ( she did n't do the nails all the way this time ) . When I opened my eyes after the final powdering and looked in the mirror , I was astonished . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I thought I was going to sneak these clothes home . I had n't thought that far ahead . I asked her what she thought I should do . <p> " Why do n't you leave them with me ? " Karen asked . I said I wanted to take them home so I could wear them more than just once . She gave me her address and reassured me that I could come over and dress up ( as much or as little as I pleased ) whenever she was home . It was our " little secret " she said . <p> I went over many times in the next few months . And each time she indulged me . She even bought me little presents for my birthday . I was like the little sister she always wanted she once told me . It was a friendship that lasted until I left for college and even then I 'd come back and visit occasionally . And when I did she 'd have me stay the night in the nighties I always admired of hers ... but that 's another story ...

In my third year , I had to change my schedule and take classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays . That 's when I found out that there was a Halloween party every year . I came to the next two parties in my shirt and tie ' cause I always came directly from work to school . <p> As luck would have it , a friend of mine , who was also a photographer , had an event to photograph and needed help . First , his receptionist booked the event while he was out of town . She should have known that something was up when the client showed up five minutes after hanging up the phone to put down a deposit . The event was an annual Gay Costume Ball that was held every year , and my friend was a Mucho Macho Green Beret . Needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball was held every July .

I would go as a woman ! <p> I did n't know where to start , so I went to the largest costume shop in town and asked what costumes they had to fit me . The only one they had was a French Maid outfit for large women . So , there you go . When I got it home I found that it was lacking in many areas . My wife and I went to the downtown mall on the weekend ( when it was always pretty near empty ) to the Fredrick 's of Hollywood store . I got a black garter belt , fishnet hose , black bra and a black garter with a gold heart . The sales girl kept bringing me more bras and garter belts to try on .

I found a pearl necklace ( a choker on me ! ) with matching clamp-on earrings . <p> I took a day of vacation on the day of the party . I laid everything out on the bed and added a pair of black , silk boxer shorts ( ' tap pants ' ) . I got into the shower and had a good time with the razor . Out and completely smooth . <p> Sat down and started putting on my make-up . Finally , I started getting dressed . It felt so wonderful . Put on the brightly painted Lee 's nails and my wig .

No parking places close to the school ! I parked three blocks away , loaded up my books and food and started walking . <p> Hum ? What 's going to be the best way to get into the building ? I know , I 'll go in the side door next to the auditorium . Feet are n't hurting as much as I thought . Made it to the door . It 's just a short walk to the stairs and up to my classroom . <p> Oh My God ! I have walked into a sea of cap and gowns ! ! The cosmetology class is having a graduation !

As I walk up the stair , I see one of my classmates getting ready to leave the library . Quickly up the stairs and turn the corner . I can hear his footsteps coming up quickly behind me . As he gets closer , I hear his steps slow ; he 's checking me out . He goes past me and , I let him get about three steps ahead . <p> Standing there , looking at each other .

The door opens into the side of the classroom and my computer table is straight across the room . I share the table with a guy I know from the photo lab I use to process my film . He has a speech impediment , he stutters . As I put my books down , he looks up , cowers back , staring , unable to speak . <p> Time to look at Mr. Martin ! Never did get to see him !

The girl cut off the halo of curls I had around my head , but I still had quite long hair . I demanded that they tie my hair with a ribbon and after I kicked up an awful fuss , they at last found one and tied it into my hair , much to my mother 's discomfort . On leaving the shop , a woman passing by said that it was dreadful to put a ribbon in a boy 's hair , and suddenly I felt so shamed that I pulled the ribbon from my locks and threw it on the ground . <p> It was about this time that I found an old silky dress of mother 's in the rag bag and I dragged it out and wore it in my bedroom after mother had put me to bed .

This was a very strange dream to have for two reasons , the first was that at that time I had no knowledge of the difference between boys and girls , and the second was that I was pleased she had performed the operation . <p> When I went to school I played mostly with the girls . I envied them their dresses and pigtails and loved their simple games , dressing up , acting out being mothers or nurses . I hated my grey shorts and shirt , looked at my clumsy shoes and compared them with the girls ' neat attractive footwear . <p> I then moved to a boys school where there were many boys of Scottish descent who wore kilts . I wished I could also wear a kilt but I wanted also to wear a slip under it .

Even so , I would pluck an eyebrow , steal some makeup from Woolworth 's and secretly experiment with it and managed to buy some girl 's vests and panties from Woolworths , which I wore under my school wear when ever we did not have sport or physical training . I was attractive to a certain type of boy and although they became quite pests , I rejected them . It was not what I wanted . I knew by the age of twelve that I wanted to be a girl . I also managed to get some more grown up undies , a bra , a petticoat and a nightie , as well as a couple of pairs of lace trimmed panties , which I kept in a biscuit tin in a special hiding place . <p> I was thirteen when mother found these items and challenged me about it .

I actually had swelling in my breasts , but just as I was rejoicing at the pain of it and feeling the hard swelling behind the nipple , it subsided and disappeared as this female development was killed off by male hormones suddenly rushing through my body . I still wanted to be a girl and told my mother ; I was sent to the GP . I sat there hoping for a miracle , but once again found no salvation . I was told bluntly , that I was male and always would be . It was like receiving a life sentence . I saw a psychiatrist in a London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that would help and declined . <p> Mother turned a blind eye to my experiments with her make-up and clothes .

It was squirm making to go into a shop and select clothes and purchase them with the assistants knowing that I was a boy . Mother too felt the shame , and was bad tempered , not enjoying having a sissy son . <p> I eventually finished school and joined a bank in the city of London . I wore my underwear under my city suit . I was popular with the girls and the chaps I worked with , even playing rugger for the banks team . At the same time , my real feelings were tearing at me .

I loved my days and hours as a girl , hated taking off the make-up and dressing as a man again . I was never challenged , but at that time I could have been arrested had I been discovered . <p> I saw another GP , told him of my problems and he arranged a consultation with another psychiatrist . This man told me that marriage would make a man of me and that I could accommodate my cross dressing tendencies by taking up amateur dramatics .

She had a certain cheeky charm and her boss engineered a date for us . I liked her company and she seemed to like mine . Eventually , we became engaged and married a year later . Although I loved her , sex was extremely difficult for me , and I received precious little encouragement from her , but our infrequent love making resulted in two children . <p> All seemed well for two or three years , then I was hit by a terrible hopelessness .

She and her mother were horrified , and I was so filled with a sense of failure and shame that any discussion was impossible . <p> I saw the GP again . He stated in Biblical terms , that ' this devil needed to be rooted out . ' <p> I was sent to the consultant in London , who was at that time the foremost expert on sexual deviation .

The GP then said that they could take me into the local mental hospital , put me to sleep for some three months , then see how I was on awakening . If that failed , electric shock therapy could be applied . <p> The marriage staggered on , with me gradually succumbing more and more to my need to feminise myself . Astonishingly , I continued to work , and even won a prize for the greatest increase in turnover amongst over one hundred and twenty sales people .

The student doctors surrounding us during this conversation were amused . He was not , nor was I. He agreed to treat me as a transsexual . The conditions were that in exchange for hormones , I had to live and work as a female and if I survived , after four years I would receive reassignment therapy . I resigned from my work and started living as a female full time . <p> Finding work was an ordeal , but eventually I saw an advert recruiting civil servants .

After two years I was promoted and in another two years promoted again . Then came surgery . My breasts had emerged to become a B size , my male appendages had to go by surgery at Charing Cross .

When June had called Francine , shed learned that it was a slow day at her salon , and shed be able to fit Timmy in any time during the afternoon . <p> As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a department store that carried a pretty line of clothes for women and girls . <p> The idea of dressing a little boy like a girl made June and Barbara eager to start , and was obviously devilishly fun for the two women . <p> June found a space in the stores parking lot , then held Timmy by the hand as they entered the store and got on the elevator . When it reached the second floor , they got off and walked through the womens department into the girls department . <p> " June , where should we start ? " asked Barbara . <p> " Panties first , " replied June . " Well start from the inside and work outward . " <p> A pleasant looking middle age saleslady with a tape measure hanging around her neck came over to them . <p> " My name is Marsha . Can I help you ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , " said June . " My little nephew is going to be my little niece , so there 's a lot of things we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panties for him please ? " <p> " What a lucky little boy he is , " said Marsha with a nice smile at Timmy . " I 'll take his measurements first , including his shoe size , and you can begin picking out whatever you want for him . Ill be glad to help you if you have any questions . I have three darling little grand-daughters about his age . " Marsha quickly took Timmys measurements , writing his sizes on a pad , and gave them to June . <p> June and Barbara picked out some pretty lace trimmed nylon tricot rumba panties for a little girl in Timmys size . She also picked out some regular nylon tricot panties in different pastel colors with white lace trim just around the leg openings , and then moved on to three long racks of bouffant slips for girls . Marsha showed them where the size seven bouffant slips were , and June and Barbara began picking out some for Timmy . Eventually they decided on three pink ones with nylon parchment overskirts , pretty white lace at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner layers of pink nylon horsehair netting , also trimmed with white lace , and three white slips lace decorated in the same way . The innermost layer of nylon netting was lined with nylon tricot so it would n't be scratchy on a little girls legs . At this point June had already begun to regard Timmy as her little girl . <p> " I just love the new bouffant style , " said Barbara . " Its so pretty and feminine . " <p> " Yes . Its the prettiest style since the Edwardian long dresses that had a short train and bustle , " agreed June . " Let 's pick out some dresses for my little girl now . " She smiled down at Timmy . Timmy was still smiling too . <p> It took a half hour before the two women had picked out eight pretty dresses for Timmy . June also bought a cute pink poodle skirt and three white button-back blouses with little flowers embroidered on their bodices . Then Marsha showed them the shoes and socks for little girls . June bought some shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of shiny white patent leather shoes , also having a strap and buckle like his black Maryjanes . Next they got some ankle socks in pastel colors to match his dresses and some white ones with tiny pastel colored flowers on them . <p> " By the way , " suggested Marsha , " we have some pretty **27;58;TOOLONG . Would you like to see them ? " <p> " Yes , " said June . " I think my little niece will like wearing a dress like her auntys dress . And I 'll be setting a good example for her when we wear them together . " <p> Marsha led them to a separate rack of the dresses , and June picked out a set in lilac and white checks , a pink gingham set , and a set in red with little white polka dots . <p> " Come on Barbara , " said June . " I think I 've got everything for now . " <p> " June , what about a little pocketbook and some white cotton gloves ? " asked Barbara . " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Leaving the other dresses and things on the counter where the cash register was , June took the pink gingham set of dresses , lacy pink rumba panties and a white bouffant slip for little girls with her as she brought Timmy into one of the dressing rooms . Barbara stood at the entrance to their dressing room , holding Timmys new ankle socks and shoes . <p> Inside the dressing room , June helped Timmy take off all his clothes . Then she held open the rumba panties . Timmy stepped into them and June drew the elastic band up to his waist . <p> " Now for your poufy slip sweetheart , " said June . " This is the kind of petticoat all little girls wear . Youll be wearing petticoats now , just like big girls and ladies and do . " <p> She lifted the white bouffant slip over his head , telling him to put his hands up high . The layers of the slip came down over him with a little tugging , the adjustable straps settling on his shoulders . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outermost layer of his bouffant slip , with a small pink bow at the top center of its lacy bodice . Barbara stood at the entrance to the dressing room , wondering just how cute a little girl Timmy would look like when he was all dressed up pretty and had his hair done at Francines salon . <p> Next came his dress . It was Timmys part of the pink gingham set of the **27;87;TOOLONG . June told him to put his hands up high again and brought the little dress down over his head , making sure his hands and arms went into the short puffed sleeves , then gently turned him around , buttoned up the back of it , and tied the white sash in a big pretty bow at the back of his waist . The last items were pink ankle socks and the white strap and buckle shoes to match the colors of his gingham dress . <p> " Now I 'll put on my new dress , too sweetheart , " said June , and changed into her part of the **27;116;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They emerged from the dressing room , and June held Timmys hand and led him to a tall three-sided mirror , and stood in back of him as they looked at themselves . She had dropped Timmys boys clothes and sneakers in a rubbish barrel along the way to the mirror . A big smile came onto Timmys cute face as he looked at their reflection in the mirror . <p> " See how pretty you look now sweetheart ? " asked June , with a satisfied smile over Timmys appearance in his little dress . <p> Marsha was waiting for them at the the cash register , and the two women and Timmy went to it now . Marsha boxed the polka dot dress with the long gloves June had worn to the store , the other mother-and-daughter dresses , and Timmys other dresses . His other panties , ankle socks and bouffant slips were put in some of the stores large paper bags , the lacy bottom edges of his bouffant slips sticking out a little from the top of them , and his Maryjane shoes inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price tags from the things theyd put on before they went into the dressing room and added up everything on the cash register . <p> " June , " said Barbara , " let me pay for half the price of his dresses and things . " <p> " Thats not necessary Barbara , " replied June . " I collected my husbands G.I. insurance , and on a much better life insurance policy he already had before he went to Korea . Money wont be a problem for me any longer . I 'm not rich , but I 've got enough money to last me for the rest of my life , actually more than I 'll probably ever need . " <p> " Well I get plenty of alimony from my ex-husband , " said Barbara . " Lawyers make good money . Let me pay for something at least . After all , its for a wonderful good cause . " <p> June grinned and said , " Oh , just give me five dollars if it means that much to you . " <p> Instead Barbara fished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to June , insisting that she take it . <p> June paid the bill and three salesgirls carried everything down to the parking lot and placed them on the back seat of her car . <p> Fifteen minutes later , June was holding Timmy by the hand as they went up the steps into Francines beauty parlor or salon , Timmys bouffant slip whispering in a delightful manner as it moved against the skirts of his little dress . <p> Francine was aware of Junes plan for dressing her little nephew like a girl . She knew it was something some other customers of hers did , usually just for a day or two , but in some cases , for their entire summer vacations from school or even longer . There were several other women in town that had also turned their little boys into sissies . She smiled as she thought of how nice it would make June feel when she was putting her little sissy in a pretty dress and things each morning . <p> Just then they came into her salon , Francine being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew Barbara was Junes dearest friend . She paused in her work on a womans hair and bent down to Timmy . <p> " Yes , " answered June . " She used to be my little nephew , but now she 's my little niece , and she likes wearing a dress like her auntys dress . Do n't  you sweetheart ? " <p> " Yes Aunty . Its fun wearing a dress like your dress , " said Timmy with a big smile . " When I get big , I want to be a pretty lady like you Aunty . " <p> Francine bent down , gave Timmy a hug and kissed his cheek . Timmy giggled and smiled . <p> " What 's your little girls name ? " asked Francine . <p> " It was Timmy when she was a boy , " said June . " But its Tammy now . " <p> " Oh , that 's a nice name for a pretty little girl like she is , " replied Francine , still smiling at Timmy . " Do you like being a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his cute smile . " I 'm glad I 'm a girl now . " <p> " I bet you 're overjoyed to have such a pretty little girl , " said Francine . " I can imagine all the fun things you 'll be doing with Tammy . " <p> " I had n't  really thought about it in any detail Fran , " replied June , " but now that you mention it , I suppose we will have lots of fun together . Just dressing Tammy up pretty made me feel so good , and Tammy liked it too . " <p> " Go ahead and sit down and I 'll be with you in a couple of minutes , " said Francine . <p> They went over to some padded chairs along the wall and June said , " Tammy , watch how Mrs. Cummings sits down . " Barbara turned around in front of the chair to face them , then put her hands behind her and smoothed her dress and petticoats under her as she sat down . <p> " Now you sit down the same way Tammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy , and copied the way Barbara had just sat down . Then June sat down next to him on his other side . <p> " Thats right sweetheart , " said June . " Girls and ladies always sit down that way . That 's so they wo n't get wrinkles in their poufy slips and pretty dresses . Always sit down that way like a good little girl . " <p> " I will Aunty , " said Tammy , still with his cute smile . <p> Barbara looked at Tammys dress . <p> " The short puffed sleeves on little girls dresses are so cute , " said Barbara . <p> " Yes , " agreed June with a loving smile at Tammys dress . " All the dresses we bought for Tammy today have them . But I 'll probably be buying some sleeveless dresses with shoulder straps and a square boat-neckline for Tammy when the weather gets hot , and maybe some little petticoats instead of bouffant slips for her thatll be cooler in the summer . " <p> Francine smiled again as she heard June talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the customer in the styling chair . The lady got up , paid , tipped and thanked Francine , then left the salon after giving her dress and petticoats a rustling shake to fluff them up in front of a full-length mirror near the door . <p> " Come to me Tammy , " said Francine as she bent down and held her arms and hands open in front of her . " Its time to make your hair look pretty sweetheart . " <p> Tammy got off the chair and walked over to Francine with a big smile . She easily lifted him up into the styling chair with a thick pad on it she used to raise the height of the little girls whose hair she styled . <p> " Tell me June , " said Francine . " How did you manage to keep Tammys hair so long while she was in school ? " <p> " I 've been kind of planning this for the past year or so . I still have my teachers certificate and qualified as a single parent to get the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past year . And I 'll have plenty of time to be with my little girl even after school starts in the September by continuing with her home schooling . " <p> " Pardon the expression June , but I think Tammys as cute as a bugs ear , " said Francine as she smiled at Tammy and examined his hair . " What a fun filled life hell have being your little girl . By the way , it looks and smells like you gave Tammy a shampoo today . " <p> " Yes , " replied June . " I gave him a BRECK shampoo while he was in his bubble bath this morning . " <p> " Thats the best store-bought shampoo on the market , " said Francine . " I use a professional one that gives a little more sheen to hair . But Tammys hair looks fine already . " <p> Francine opened a drawer in the counter under the long mirror and took out a little bottle of pink fingernail polish . <p> " June , put one of the folding chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint her fingernails while I work on her hair , " said Francine , handing the bottle to her . " But before you start , tell me how you 'd like Tammys hair done . " <p> " Oh , in the department stores and sometimes in a dress shop , " answered June . " Why ? " <p> " Ever been to THE LITTLE PRINCESS DRESS SHOP ? " asked Francine . <p> " No , " replied June . " Is that a new store ? " <p> " Yes . A Mrs. Simmons from Boston opened it up a week ago on Summer Street , " answered Francine . " She has a better grade of girls clothes than the other stores in town . She sells clothes for girls from toddler up to the age of thirteen or fourteen , and her selection of panties , bouffant slips and dresses is very nice . You should check it out . I 'm sure you 'll like it , and her prices are quite reasonable . " <p> " Perhaps next week , " replied June . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to start getting supper ready when we get home . " <p> " I know most people say dinner now when they refer to the evening meal , " said June . " But how come they call some restaurants supper clubs ? " <p> " Good question , " answered Francine . " I guess its just an old term they think fits . " <p> " By the way Fran , would you care to dine with us tonight ? " asked June . " Were having pot roast . Therell be plenty to go around . " <p> " I 'd love to , " answered Francine , " but I have a date tonight . " <p> " Hmmm ... Anybody we know ? " asked Barbara . <p> " I doubt it , " replied Francine . " He just moved into the house next door to mine three days ago . But I 'll take a rain check on your invitation . Itd be nice to see Tammy again . " <p> " Just three days ago ? " said Barbara . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied Francine with a wink , " but not too fast , if you know what I mean . " <p> " Just phone me when you have a free evening , " offered June . " I 'd love to have you join us . And you could see Tammy again , too . " <p> While theyd been talking , Francine had cut some bangs on Tammys forehead , brought the rest of his black hair back and up from his neck , and tied it in a six inch ponytail with a two inch wide pink ribbon in a pretty bow to go with Tammys pink gingham dress . The tag ends of the pert bow hung down a few inches , and his ponytail curled up outward a little at the end of it . <p> " Oh , yes June ! " said Barbara when Francine was finished . " Tammy looks darling with her ponytail . It would have been a waste to get it cut short for a pixie cut . " <p> " She does look cute , does n't  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Cute ? Shes adorable , " said Francine smiling at Tammy . Then she dug out a pink lipstick from one of the drawers under the long counter . " Ill put some pink lipstick on Tammy to match her pink gingham dress . Then I 'll numb her earlobes to pierce them and put some gold plated studs in them . Leave them in overnight , and tomorrow you can put some dainty pearl studs in them . But first I 'm just going to thin her eyebrows a little . " <p> Finally Francine was finished and lifted Tammy down from the styling chair . She bent down and gave Tammy a hug and kissed his cheek . <p> " Goodbye sweetheart , " said Francine . " Be a good little girl for your nice aunty , and always play nice with other little girls . " <p> " Yes Mrs. Fran . I will , " said Tammy with his cute smile . <p> June paid , tipped and thanked her , and they left the salon to go home . <p> ONE WEEK LATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junes living room couch as they had iced tea and chatted . Barbara had just arrived a minute earlier with two large paper bags from a store . <p> June made an effort to an effort to always refer to Tammy as she or her now , but sometimes she slipped up , saying he or him instead . <p> Barbara followed June to her kitchen windows and together they looked out on Junes patio and flower garden in the backyard . Hop-Scotch squares were drawn in chalk on the surface of the patio . <p> " June ! " exclaimed Barbara . " Tammys actually playing Hop-Scotch with two other little girls . Who are they ? " <p> " Susan Conway and Nancy Evans . They live just down the street a little way . Their mothers brought them over about a half hour ago . Tammy loves playing little girls games . He s so happy now . But he also plays with some other little sissies . Theres Corrine Beliveaus sissy nephew Maryanne and Mrs. Sanfords sissy Marybeth . " <p> " Gosh ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women near us had little boys that were sissies . " <p> " I 'm not sure they were all sissies at first and liked wearing dresses and being taught to be good little girls , " replied June . " But any little boy will like being a little girl in a few days once he sees how nice it is to wear panties , poufy slips and pretty dresses . Personally , I think its good for them . Theyll probably treat women better when they grow up . Theres seven or eight other real girls Tammy plays with also . " <p> " Its just like I said it would be , " replied Barbara with a smile . " Tammys little dress and bouffant slip bounce up and down every time he hops to another square . He s so cute . Oh , you 're so lucky to have such a darling little sissy . " <p> " I know , " said June with a smile . " It makes me feel so good to dress him up pretty every morning . But please do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset him if he found out what it means . He thinks he s my little girl now , and he is , except for a little difference inside his lacy panties . " <p> " Where did Tammy learn to play Hop-Scotch ? " asked Barbara . <p> " The little girls and other sissies taught him , " answered June . " And he s so happy to have some little girlfriends now to play with . I knew Tammy would fit right in with them . " <p> " June , did you ever think that maybe Tammy should have been born a girl ? " Barbara asked . <p> " Yes . I have , " replied June . " Perhaps I 'm just correcting one of Mother Natures mistakes . Tammys so happy now being my little girl . I love to cuddle with him on the couch while we watch television after supper . The day after we first went shopping for Tammy , I bought four pretty little nighties for him . Some day I 'd like to go shopping in White Plains . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for myself as well . " <p> " I always wished I 'd had a little girl , but I got divorced before I could get pregnant , " said Barbara . <p> " I always wanted a little girl too , " said June . " But my husband died in Korea from a heart attack . We had decided to wait til he got home before having any children . But Tammy helps me to forget the unhappiness of that time . I know he s really my sissy nephew , but now its just as if he was my little niece . It makes me feel so good . here 's a picture of us jumping rope together in one of our **25;145;TOOLONG sets . " <p> " Yes , I taught him how , " answered June , " and how to make a little curtsey , too . I want him to behave like a good little girl should now . " <p> " Oh , he looks darling June , " said Barbara , " just like a pretty little girl ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said June . " If Tammy does grow up to be a teenage boy later , at least I 'll have the pictures to remind me what a darling little sissy I had for a few years . I keep them in a separate photo album I bought recently . My camera has a timer <p> delay on it , so I was able to take pictures of Tammy and myself cuddling on the couch together , and jumping rope together . But the ones I really like best are the pictures I took of him playing with little girls and the other sissies . He likes playing with his little girlfriends now , and is n't lonely and sad anymore . I love to hear him giggle and laugh . " <p> " How do the other little girls treat him ? " asked Barbara . <p> " Just the same as theyd treat another real little girl , " said June . " They all think he is one . By the way , there 's another little boy in the neighborhood whose mother dresses him like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . Usually he plays with Tammy too . His name is Charlene now instead of Charles . " <p> " Really ? Isnt he with them now ? " asked Barbara . <p> " Not today , " explained June . " His mother took him with her when she went to visit some other friends of hers today . She said she loves showing him off to other ladies . They all make such a nice big fuss over him . " <p> " I was n't aware so many women in the neighborhood were petticoating their little boys , " said Barbara . " But I hardly blame them . Having a little sissy and teaching him to be a good little girl must be so nice . Just helping you to shop for Tammy was so much fun . " <p> " I do n't  think petticoating is as uncommon a thing to do as I did before , " replied June . " And I know I did the right thing , since Tammy must have been a sissy . He loves being my little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him in a pretty little dress . I suppose all women feel the same way about their little girls . " <p> " He really seems to have adapted well to wearing his little dresses and bouffant slips , " observed Barbara as they continued to watch Tammy playing Hop-Scotch with the neighbors little girls . <p> " Yes , he has . A sissys instinct I guess , " said June with a little laugh . " And its not so noisy in the house now . Sissies and girls do n't  make as much noise when they play with their dolls as regular little boys make playing cops and robbers or soldiers . " <p> " He really plays with dolls now ? " asked Barbara . <p> " Yes , " answered June . " The day I bought his little nighties , I also bought him a cute MAGIC SKIN doll , and a couple of rag dolls . He takes one of the rag dolls with him to bed now along with his teddy bear . " <p> " June , I 'd never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't  been with you when we took him shopping , dressed him and had his hair done at Francine 's . He really does look like a cute little girl now . " <p> " And he behaves like a good little girl too , " said June . " No yelling in the house when he and the real girls play together with their dolls . Little boys are a lot noisier . And he keeps his knees and feet together when he s standing or sitting down like a little girl , too . There 's something else I do with Tammy now when its his bedtime . I got a prescription for some lactation pills , and I have him come to bed with me and breast feed him til he falls asleep . Then I carry him back to his own bed . He looks forward to it every night now . " <p> " I bet you do too , " said Barbara , as she opened the two paper bags she had brought with her from a store . " I know I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought Tammy a nice little pastel blue dress , a white bouffant slip to wear under it , and a matching blue hair bow . And I got him some more pretty rumba panties too . " <p> " Thanks Barbara , " said June . " You really shouldnt have . Still , I suppose every little girl or sissy should have lots of panties , poufy slips and pretty dresses to wear . " <p> Soon it was almost five oclock , and the little girls Tammy was playing with were picked up by their mothers and went home . <p> Before making supper , June and Barbara took Tammy upstairs to his bedroom and changed him into the little blue dress Barbara had bought for him . Then June took a picture of him back downstairs , kneeling up on a bamboo porch chair shed brought into the living room with his white cotton gloves on . She had untied his ponytail to let his wavy black hair hang down and put the pretty matching blue hair bow on top of it . <p> ONE YEAR LATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day away , and June pulled all stops . She had taken him shopping at THE LITTLE PRINCESS DRESS SHOP , the store just for little girls Francine had told her about . When they left , besides having bought Tammy some more panties , bouffant slips and some new dresses in the larger size he wore now , she had also bought him a pink cotton party dress , with all the frills , bows and lacy decorations they have . It even had little faux jewels on it and had its own pretty four layered petticoat sewn into it . Tammy loved it when he saw it on himself in the stores tall three-sided mirror . He could hardly wait for his little girlfriends they were going to invite to the party to see how pretty his party dress was . <p> By now , Junes other friends had visited her and met Tammy . They all thought he made a darling little girl . June had also invited the other petticoated little sissies in the neighborhood to the party along with their mothers or aunts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tucked him back in his pretty canopy bed , and Barbara helped June decorate the living room . Colorful twisted crepe paper streamers criss-crossed just below the ceiling , and they blew up two dozen balloons and tied them to the streamers . June had baked a big birthday cake and stuck a lot more than eight little candles in the frosting to make it look more festive . Then both women worked together making two large pitchers of slightly sweet lemonade . <p> Afterwards , June and Barbara wrapped Tammys presents June had bought for him in some pretty gift paper and tied them up with pink ribbon having a nice bow on top . Tammys presents were just what youd expect for an eight year old little girl : some new dresses , bouffant slips , boxed sets of pretty panties , more books of paper dolls , coloring books and jig-saw puzzles for little girls . Barbara had already wrapped her own presents for Junes huggable little sissy , but kept them at home til the next day . <p> The next day was Tammys birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own little girls began to arrive at Junes house . June was glad to see Jane Belmore with her darling sissy Charlene as well . He had also turned eight years old a month earlier . Sissy Maryanne came too with his pretty aunt , Corrine Beliveau . <p> June had dressed Tammy in his pretty pink party dress with a pink bouffant slip under it and pink panties trimmed with white lace . Shed untied his long ponytail again , and his long hair was hanging down his back in long waves , with a pink bow on the top of his hair . <p> Tammy was very excited , and a big smile was on his face all day . June had coated his lips with a pink lipstick and put a pink nail polish on his fingernails . Dainty pearl studs were in his pierced earlobes . Being spring , she thought he should wear his white shoes that had a strap and buckle like his black Maryjanes . His ankle socks were pink to match his dress . Barbara gave Tammy a hug and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she placed her present for Tammy on the coffee table in the living room . <p> As the other women arrived , most of them wearing white or a light color summer dress , June greeted them at the door , placing her cheek near theirs without actually touching so they would n't smudge each others makeup . Tammy curtseyed nice to the ladies like June had taught him to do to ladies , and the women helped June by wheeling in a utility cart covered by a small table cloth with the birthday cake on it , setting out the silverware and making sure everything was ready . <p> As soon the refreshments had been served and theyd all sang Happy Birthday , Tammy had blown out the candles on his birthday cake , then unwrapped all his presents and thanked all the little girls and sissies that had given him a present , though theyd actually been picked out and bought by their mothers , aunts and step-mothers . <p> June , Jane , Corrine , Mrs. Sanford and Barbara looked on with loving smiles at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him presents , and had also received the usual hugs and kisses on their cheeks by all the women when they arrived . <p> " Sweetheart , " said June , " give Charlene , Marybeth and Maryanne a nice kiss on the lips . They 're going to be your girlfriends now , too . " <p> The sissies all came together in the middle of the living room and took turns leaning towards each other , one after the other , their hands a little away from the sides of their dresses for balance , and kissed each other as the women looked on with approving smiles and made gushy feminine comments about how precious they were . <p> " Wasnt that nice ? " said June . " Now you 're all girlfriends and can play Hop-Scotch and Jacks and jump rope together . " <p> " They can take turns having a sleepover together now too , " said Jane . <p> " Yes sweetheart , " June told Tammy . " You can tell each other your little girl secrets before you go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theyd all finished their cake , lemonade and ice cream , June told Tammy , the real little girls and the other sissies they could go outside so they could play Hop-Scotch together . They all eagerly went outside , and the women began to talk about their sissies littlegirliness . <p> " Yes , " said Corrine . " At first I petticoated my nephew Maryanne because I do n't  particularly like little boys . But it was so much fun once he began to behave like a good little girl . Now his mother has sold her house and moved in with me so we could take turns dressing him in the morning . " <p> " I love Charlene being my little girl too , " said Jane . " I do n't  think he was a sissy when I first dressed him in some pretty clothes for a little girl . But after a little while , he liked it so much that I knew I made him a sissy , and now he behaves just like a real little girl . I couldnt be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to behave like a good little girl makes me feel so wonderful . " <p> " I agree with you completely , " said June . " And now I 'm not lonely anymore . It was really a blessing having Timmy move in with me after his parents died in that awful accident . Its just as nice to have a little sissy as a real little girl . " <p> " I 'm going to see about getting Charlene hormone treatments and sexual reassignment surgery when he s a little older , " said Jane Belmore . <p> " Really Jane ? " replied June . " I 've never even thought about that . " <p> " Maybe you should consider it June , " advised Jane . " Once a boy had been turned into a sissy , hell never fit it with regular boys when he gets older . Besides , think how nice it would be to see him as your real teenage girl going to her first prom dance with a corsage on her pretty gown . " <p> " Oh , yes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give it some thought . I certainly would n't want Tammy to be unhappy when he grows up . " <p> " Christine Jorgensen has turned out to be a well-adjusted , happy and pretty woman following her hormone treatments and surgery , " said Jane . " Its hard to believe she was once a man in the army . She said she loves wearing her garter belt , panties , her petticoats and full dresses with her nylons and high heels . " <p> " I wonder how pretty a teenage girl hed be if I do get him the surgery and hormone treatments , " mused June . " I think hed be a pretty young women when he grows up . In a way , itll be sort of sad though . He s such a cute little sissy . I sort of wish he did n't  have to grow up . I just love having my nephew behaving like a good little girl now . He loves it when we wear our **27;172;TOOLONG . Ive been so busy lately that I have n't really been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends yet . But making him a sissy if he was n't one , and dressing him like my little girl has made both of us so happy . Actually , he may have been a sissy even before I petticoated him , so it was probably the best thing for his happiness and my own as well . " <p> " Yes , " agreed Jane Belmore . " And Charlene would be very unhappy if I told him he had to be a boy again and could n't wear dresses anymore . Psychiatric studies of sissies has shown that it becomes too ingrained in their psyche to be able to be well-adjusted and happy regular boys again after we 've made them sissies . It really ca n't be undone without making them seriously disturbed and unhappy . Theyll always have their happy memories of being pretty little girls haunting them if they do n't  become real teenage girls with hormone treatments and sex change surgery . " <p> " I 'll do whatever it takes to keep Tammy happy , " said June . " I owe it to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely gown when goes to his high school dances . I always did . Besides , being a woman is so much nicer than being a man . All they do is work and watch sports on television or play golf on their days off . They never know how nice it feels to be wearing a new dress or pretty petticoat . And keeping myself looking as pretty as I can is something I do to set a good example for Tammy . " <p> Then Corrine began talking about a dress sale she went to by herself while Maryanne stayed home with his mother , and the conversation drifted away from the talk about their sissies and was concerned just with buying their own dresses and lingerie . <p> They were so occupied with their talking that they had n't  noticed the new Buick that had to park on the street with the overflow of cars because there was no room left in the driveway . A somewhat older woman went up the walk and pressed the button for the front door chimes , dying to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June had told her about . <p> June answered the door . <p> " Mother ! I 'm so glad you could make it to Tammys party , " said June . " Come in . Tammys outside playing Hop-Scotch with the other girls . But theyll be back in here soon . Hey everybody , this is my mother Shirley . " <p> Shirley was a little less than fifty years old and still a pretty woman . <p> They gave each other a little hug , Shirley made a hello in the direction of the other women and sat down after handing her daughter a few birthday presents for Tammy . <p> " Its not all that much June , " said Shirley . " Just a pretty little dress I saw on sale , and a pearl necklace with a matching bracelet . Every little girl or sissy should have some pearls to wear on special occasions . I hope they come back in soon . I 'm dying to see Tammy in his party dress . " <p> " Thats a very pretty dress you have on today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Best &amp; Co. in Boston last week , " Shirley replied . " I love Boston . It seems so much more cultured than hectic New York City . At noontime , I had a prime rib dinner with all the fixings at Durgin Park . But now I suppose I 'll have to start dieting for a week . By the way , would you mind if I stayed here for a few days or perhaps a week ? We could shop together for Tammy . I 'd love to see him wearing a pretty little dress I 'd bought for him . " <p> " Of course mother , " answered June . " I 'll make up the bed in the back spare room with some fresh sheets for you . The front spare room is Tammys pretty bedroom now . You 'll love it when you see it . I bought him a canopy bed with a lace trimmed ruffled pink canopy . Its pillow cases have lace trim also . Its so pretty I almost wish I was a little girl again . Tammy loves it . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been buying him the prettiest panties , bouffant slips and dresses for a little girl I could find . The little lamb did n't  have a chance of not becoming a sissy . I 'm not positive he was already a sissy , not that it makes much difference now , because he loves being my little girl and playing with other sissies and real little girls . Ill have Tammy come in here for a few minutes so you can see him . " <p> Shirley and the rest of the women continued talking , while June went to the back door and called to Tammy , telling him to come inside for a few minutes . She held him by the hand and led him into the living room , and they stood together in front of Shirley . <p> " Tammy , this is Auntys mommy , " said June . " Say hello to Gramma like a good little girl . " <p> Tammy curtseyed like June had taught him to do when he met ladies and said , " Hi Gramma . Aunty bought me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as she wrapped her arms around Tammy , gave him a hug and kissed his cheek , making him giggle . <p> " You can go back out and play with the other girls now Tammy , " said Shirley . " But always be nice to the other little girls when you play with them sweetheart . " <p> " I am Gramma , " said Tammy with his cute smile . <p> About 4:00 that afternoon the party came to an end , with the ladies collecting their little girls and sissies to go home . Tammy came back inside and began playing with a new doll that had been one of his birthday presents . The diapers that came with it were kept closed with sticky tabs instead of diaper pins that would be too dangerous for a little girl . <p> June took Tammy upstairs to take his party dress off and change him into a different slip and dress . She decided to have Tammy wear a pink bouffant slip that had been one of his birthday presents . When it was on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then June put him in the pretty blue dress Barbara had bought for him . <p> " Tomorrow well put your hair back in a ponytail and bangs again sweetheart , " said June . <p> Shirley always pitched in to help when she visited June , and had gone into the kitchen and began washing the ice cream dishes , plates for the cake , the silverware and the glasses used for the lemonade , and to put the remains of Tammys birthday cake away while June began to stack the folding chairs she had rented to have enough seats for the party . <p> Just as Shirley was washing the dishes , a thunder storm began with bright close flashes of lightning , and very loud claps of thunder . Tammy came running into the kitchen crying . <p> " Gramma ... Gramma , " cried Tammy . " Make it stop . " <p> " I did n't  know our little girl was afraid of thunder , " said Shirley . " I guess I 'll have to do what the ladies out west do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink sweetheart , and I 'll hide you from the thunder and lightning . " <p> Tammy knelt down and looked up to see Shirley lifting her dress and petticoats up just before she dropped them down over him . <p> " You stay under my dress and petticoats til that bad old storm goes away Tammy , " said Shirley . " The lightning wont know where you are now . Youll be safe there precious . " Then she continued drying the dishes with a dish towel and placing them in a rack on the sinks drain board . <p> Later that evening , Tammy was sitting between June and Shirley watching Auntys and Shirleys favorite television program , The Ann Sothern Show . Miss Sothern was a secretary in an office and always wore petticoats under her dresses . <p> " Yes Aunty , " replied Tammy . " I like to be pretty like you and Gramma are . But I saw a lady in the store when we went shopping that was n't wearing any petticoats . " <p> " Sometimes ladies do n't  wear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they 're working , " explained June . <p> " Why ? " persisted Tammy . <p> " Because men keep looking at them instead of paying attention to their work , " explained June . " Big boys and men like to see a ladys or girls petticoats because they 're so pretty . " <p> " I 'm glad I 'm a girl Aunty , " said Tammy , " cause I like wearing my dresses and slips a lot more than wearing blue jeans . " <p> THREE YEARS LATER <p> Tammy was now eleven years old . He still received lots of nice presents on his birthdays , but June did n't  have a big party for him anymore . Shirley would stay for a few days with them now and then , and go shopping with June and Tammy . Sometimes Jane Belmore would go with them . June would bring Tammy and Jane would bring Charlene . Charlene had become Tammys best friend . <p> " You and Charlene are getting to be a big girls now Tammy , " June told him . " Pretty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandstand in the park after supper . " <p> At this point in his life , Tammy had hardly any memories of when he was a little boy , and the few memories that he did have were rapidly dimming and being replaced by his happy memories of his little girl years . <p> June continued to take pictures of Tammy to keep in the big photo album shed bought just for pictures of her sissy . <p> One day Jane Belmore stopped in with Charlene . <p> " June , would you like to go with Charlene and me ? " asked Jane . " I want to get Charlene a pastel blue bouffant slip thatll go nice with her blue dresses . Mrs. Simmons Little Princess Dress Shop advertised some in the paper . " <p> " As a matter of fact Jane , " replied June , " Tammy got a stain on one of her pink bouffant slips , and I 'd like to get a replacement for it . I 'll get Tammy ready to go and get my hat and gloves . Ive been meaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weathers nice today , so we might as well take advantage of it . Francine said the dress shop is very nice . " <p> They made a quick drive downtown and soon Jane had parked her car along the sidewalk about a block away from the store . <p> " Seems to be a lot of shoppers out today , " said Jane . " Guess well have to walk a little way to the store . " <p> As they began walking down the sidewalk , June checked to see that Tammy was n't swinging his arms like boys do when they walk , and was taking smaller steps like girls do . She was pleased to see her sissy keeping his hand on top of his little pocketbook that hung from his left shoulder , and just kept his right arm and hand down along the side of his dress when he walked . A glance at Charlene showed Jane had properly trained her sissy to walk the same way . Both sissies also copied the limp wrist of girls and women , and always kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down . <p> Neither sissy had n't  been afraid to be seen in public for quite a while now , nor did they have to be . Both of them really looked like eleven year old girls . <p> " In a way Charlenes a little luckier than Tammy , " said June . " Just about all colors go well with her natural blond hair . Francine offered to dye Tammys hair blond , but I think her black hair is pretty enough , especially when she wears the pink hair band shes wearing today . " <p> Mrs. Simmons face reminded June of her mother , and was a very patient and helpful woman when she waited on her customers . Once Jane had told them what they were looking for , she led them to three long racks of bouffant slips . After only four or five minutes , both June and Jane had picked out the slips they wanted to buy for their sissies , now getting close to their twelfth birthday . <p> " Girls , well go to the dressing rooms and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jane . <p> The two women went into the dressing rooms with their sissies to help them . Then they went out and the sissies stood together in front of the women . Some panties , petticoats , bouffant slips and petti-panties were either hung on the wall or lying around waiting to be put away in the stockroom . June took her camera from her big pocketbook to take a picture of them . <p> " Face this way and together girls , " said June . " Tammy , hold up the extra panties that come with the slip . That 's it . Now do n't  move . " Her camera flashed and another picture would soon be in Junes photo album of her sissys pre-teen years . " They 're growing up so fast , " said Jane . " Yes , " agreed June . " Theyll be teenagers in another year or so . Soon theyll be getting their hair permed at Francines salon and going together to the dances in the park . I 'm glad Charlene is such a good girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for her best friend . " " Well , I 've tried my best to teach Charlene to be a good girl , " said Jane . " No need to worry Jane , " said June . " You definitely succeeded . When Charlene comes to my home for a sleepover with Tammy , she always very polite to me . By the way , I 've been thinking about getting the sex change surgery and hormone treatments for Tammy . " <p> " I 'm glad to hear it June , " replied Jane . " Its really the best thing for both of them . I could n't bear to have Charlene being unhappy for the rest of his life . And we both know theyll love being women during their adult years . But well have to go to the town hall and get their ages changed . Theyre supposed to be eighteen to get the surgery done . But Dorothy Gibson , the sex change surgeon , explained to me that the surgery and hormones are much more effective if its done before their bodies start changing during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . <p> We know perfectly well what will keep them happy when they grow up . The women in town refer to her sissy patients as Gibson girls after its done . Isnt that cute . We owe it to them for their future happiness . " <p> " Youre right Jane , " said June . " Besides , its for our own happiness as well theirs . Just the thought of letting Tammy grow up and be a man is too awful to contemplate . And I 'm sure it would make him very unhappy to not be able to wear petticoats and dresses anymore . " <p> But the operation was such an invasive type of surgery that June really still had some doubts about getting her sissy hormone treatments and the sex change surgery . As a result , the day came when she told Tammy that it was time for him to be a boy again . <p> Tammy off-and-on cried for the rest of the day . But June stuck to her guns and tried to explain to him that he really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big boy now . However it still took Tammy a week before he went along with the idea . <p> Now June had to teach him how boys behave and play sports . But June had trained him to be a girl so well that it took another week before he stopped putting his hands behind him and smoothing his blue jeans under him when he sat down . <p> Eventually Tammy , now Timmy again , finished high school and went to college . As mentioned before , Timmy was a bright little boy , and next he decided to go to medical school on a scholarship hed won , and become a doctor . He graduated from medical school with the second highest marks in his class , did his internship at a local hospital , finished his residency and set up a practice in his hometown as a general practioner . He still lived with his Aunt June . <p> But when he was home he often thought back to his happy days when his aunt had made him her little girl . It seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal computers became commonplace , Dr. McKay ( formerly Tammy ) bought one and set about learning about them as much as he could . Soon he was a regular computer " geek . " <p> One evening after work , he was exploring different websites and found Petticoat Pond .

" He quickly ordered four of the prettiest dresses for little girls in his adult size , along with some panties and little girl petticoats to wear under it from a seller on another website called eBay . Shoes were a bit of a problem , but after a while he found and bought from an internet dealer some white strap-and-buckle shoes in his size , and wore them with his little girl clothes . <p> Rather trying to keep his intentions a secret which would only be found out sooner or later by his aunt , he told her about it . June had smiled and said shed help him . <p> By now June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a young mother now that she had a little girl living with her again ! 
@@37517555 @6517555/ <p> My story occurred many years ago when I was eight years old . Like many boys at that particular age , I was not very fond of girls . Girls in their prissy , feminine ways just seemed so strange to us boys . I personally happened to be more bothered and critical of young girls than the average little boy . Every chance I got , I liked to tease , bother , and poke fun at all the neighborhood girls . Name-calling , pulling ponytails , and lifting up skirts was a regular routine for me . Needless to say , I was regularly in trouble with my parents for doing such antics . Many a young girl in my neighborhood would run home crying , telling tales of what that mean Dale did to them . As a result , my parents would receive many angry calls from many parents , teachers , and other guardians . In a vain attempt to straighten me out , I was regularly yelled at , punished , and spanked by my parents . It did little good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One girl in particular who was a regular and prime recipient of my torture was Michelle Dietrich from across the street . The two of us had little to do with each other , other than having a healthy dislike for one another . The three-block walk to and from our elementary school was an excellent time for me to express my unfounded repulsion toward her . It was during our daily trip to and from the third grade that I would bug her in every way I could think up . As her mother and mine were friends , my mom would get especially mad at me when told of my shenanigans by Mrs. Dietrich after she heard about it from her upset daughter . But my teasing of Michelle became such a regular occurrence , that her mom , my mom , and even Michelle came to expect that kind of behavior from me . <p> One thing that particularly bothered me about Michelle was that she sometimes had to come to my house with me after school when her mother was n't yet home from work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did , I was always mad because I had to have one of those yucky girls at my house . After the walk home school , the big event for Michelle &amp; me was to see if Mrs. Dietrichs car was in their driveway . If it was , it meant that she was home and that Michelle should go home . If the car was absent , that meant Michelle was to go across the street to my house to be watched by my mom until Mrs. Dietrich got home from work . In such situations , my mother always tried to have us play together as if we were as good of friends as she &amp; Mrs. Dietrich were . Of course , I never cooperated , as I believed I had to live up to my reputation as a girl-hater . <p> On one particularly warm , sunny day in late October , Michelle &amp; I arrived in front of our homes to see that Mrs. Dietrich had not yet made it home from work . I was especially mad since I had arranged with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after school at 4:00 PM . Even though that was still an hour away , the last thing I wanted was the possibility of Michelle hanging around my house while my friends were over . We had big plans that afternoon , determining what we were going to do for Halloween , which was right around the corner . We were going to decide what our costumes were going to be and plan the most lucrative route for trick-or-treating . I most certainly did n't  want a girl around for such important stuff . <p> As a kid , Halloween was my favorite holiday - next to Christmas . I mean , what could be better that dressing up in a scary costume and go around with all your friends and get as much candy as you could grab and haul in a three-hour time span ? <p> I had to accept the fact that Michelle had to come over to my house that afternoon , and just hope she would be gone by the time my friends arrived . We walked in the house and my mom greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how school was . I responded by saying " School was lousy because there was a bunch of smelly girls there , and now being home stinks because one of them followed me home ! " My mother was offended by my statement , but not surprised , I 'm sure . She scolded me for my rude behavior and told me not to act that way when we had company . My mom then suggested that Michelle &amp; me go outside and play while she got together some milk &amp; cookies for us . Playing with Michelle , especially outside where everyone could see us , was the last thing I wanted to do . Being a typical smart-alec , I said " fine ! " and ran out the front door and started climbing the tree in our front yard . Since Michelle was wearing a pretty dress , I knew she probably would n't want to skin up her knees by following me up there . Michelle just stood on the front porch , not knowing what to do as she watched me climb higher in the tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen to me , " Oh , Dale , you are such a pain in the butt ! " Why do n't  you just be nice for once and come down here to play with Michelle ? " I said , " Why does n't  she come up here with me ? " knowing that that wasnt going to happen . My mom called me a snot and turned to go back in the house . She had Michelle come with her since I was n't being very hospitable . They came back a few minutes later , with milk and cookies set out on a tray . My mom thought she was going to lure me down with the goodies . She asked " How about you come down and have some cookies with us ? " Although I was tempted , I stuck to my guns . I said " I will have all the sweets I want next week from trick-or-treating , so I do n't  need the cookies now ! " My mom grumbled something negative in response , and then proceeded to have a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Shortly thereafter , we heard a car horn . Mrs. Dietrich has just pulled her car into her driveway across the street . I heard my mom say , " Mrs. Dietrich is home ! Time to take you home , Michelle . " She then yelled up to me , " Dale , get down here - we have to take Michelle back home ! " I responded , " Ca n't I just stay here ? I am waiting for my friends to come over at 4:00 . " My mom shot back , " Thats over a half-hour from now ! I am not leaving you home alone for that long , especially up in that tree ! Get down now ! It will only take a minute to take Michelle across the street ! " Reluctantly , I climbed down . As soon as I did , my mom grabbed a hold of my hand and yanked me along as we crossed the street to Michelles house . At the same time , she held Michelles hand with her other hand and somehow managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Dietrich got out of her car and started apologizing to my mother . " I am so sorry ! " she said . " We had absolutely no food in the house so I had to stop off at the supermarket on the way home to get something for dinner tonight ! " My mom said , " No problem ! " I always enjoy the opportunity to spend some time with your lovely daughter . You are so lucky . I wish I has a sweet little girl of my own . " as she shot a snotty look at me . Mrs. Dietrich took a look at me and said " Well hello , Dale . Did you torture my little girl this afternoon like you always do ? " Before I could say anything rude , my mom said , " Of course he did . What a bratty little boy ! " Changing the subject , my mom asked Mrs. Dietrich if she needed help bringing in groceries . Mrs. Dietrich said that was n't necessary , but my mom insisted on helping . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing me a bag to carry into their house . I reluctantly took it and followed the three ladies into the Dietrich household , hoping that this would n't take very long . <p> When we got inside , the two adults started putting away groceries and began gabbing . When Mrs. Dietrich offered my mom some tea , I knew it was n't going to be a short mission . Michelle &amp; I just stood there , not knowing what to do . After a few moments , Mrs. Dietrich noticed us and said " Why do n't  you two go outside &amp; play ? " ( the standard busy mom request ) . I groaned at the suggestion . My mom said to her " Forget it . I already tried that one and he would n't go for it . " So Mrs. Dietrich told Michelle she could go out to play by herself . After she left , I began to whine to my mom saying " Mom , I want to get home now ! I got stuff to do . " She responded sternly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are too much of a snot to go outside &amp; play with Michelle , then you will just have to just sit down and wait for me ! " I knew my moms idea of a few minutes was really an eternity . I plopped down on the Dietrichs couch , facing the two women , and began to pout . They managed to ignore me for a while , but I became more and more obvious about my impatience . <p> So , Mrs. Dietrich decided to pay some attention to me . " What is your big hurry to get home , Dale ? Do n't  you like hanging out with us ladies ? " she said , trying to stir up something with me . I said " I have to get home to go over my Halloween plans with my friends . Plus , I do n't  like being at a girls house . " My mom explained to her that my friends were coming over in 30 minutes . Mrs. Dietrich asked me what I was going to be for Halloween . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I still have to figure that out . " Mrs. Dietrich thought for a moment and said , " I have an idea for you - it would be a really creepy costume ! " I asked half interested " What 's your idea ? " She said , " Oh I do n't  know if you could handle it . This costume idea would be really yucky and gross , going by your standards . " Hearing her description , I became highly interested in her idea . Desperate for suggestions , I begged , " Tell me ! Tell me ! " She finally said , " How about you go dressed up as a girl ? According to you , there couldnt be anything scarier ! " Hearing her lame idea , I became dejected again . I muttered , " Girls sure are gross , but there is now way I would ever dress up like one . " My mother said , " Oh , why not Dale ? I think it is a good suggestion . You would look so cute in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the idea . But the women could see they hit a sore spot with me . It became fun for them to tease me with their insane costume idea . So , they kept it up . Mrs. Dietrich said , " You could borrow one of Michelles dresses . You look to be about her size , and I 'm sure she would n't mind . " Getting more and more irritated , I kept rejecting their comments . My Mom said , " Oh she would look so darling . We could get a wig and a nice little purse for her ! " Mrs. Dietrich added , " I think she should carry a little baby doll too ! " Being called a " she " really ticked me off . After putting up with numerous similar comments , I finally had enough . I flipped out and yelled at them " I AM NOT GOING TO DRESS UP LIKE A GOOFY GIRL ! IT IS A DUMB IDEA AND YOU ARE STUPID FOR EVEN SUGGESTING IT ! " <p> Hearing my outburst , my mom got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I knew I was in for it . She hissed at me , " How dare you talk to Mrs. Dietrich like that in her own home ! I am so embarrassed ! " With that she got up from her chair and stomped across the room to me , bent down , grabbed me by my shoulders , and gave me a vigorous shaking as she continued to scold me . She said , " I have had just about enough from you today ! You have n't even been home from school for an hour , yet and you have managed to make my blood boil with your intolerable behavior towards Mr. Dietrich and Michelle ! " With that , she commanded me to apologize to Mrs. Dietrich as she shoved me over in front of her . I could see that Mrs. Dietrich had an embarrassed look on her face too . I said to my mom , " Well she started it ! " My mom said , " Nonsense ! Now you say you 're sorry ! " Mrs. Dietrich spoke up , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You cant blame him for not wanting to dress up as a girl for Halloween . " My mom responded , " But its how he went about expressing it to you . He needs to learn his manners ! " With that , I had to start my apology . I muttered , " I 'm sorry Mrs. Dietrich . " " Sorry for what ! " my mom said . " Sorry for calling you stupid " , I said . My mom said , " And what else ? " I said " Sorry for calling your costume idea dumb " . " And what else ? " my mom said again . It was one of those kind of apologies - the kind where you are forced to think up things to be sorry about , just to get through the ordeal . When I was finished , Mrs. Dietrich responded , " I am sorry too Dale . I was wrong to tease you . But now maybe you can see that its not nice to tease someone because they are of the opposite gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever ! " With that statement , my mom could tell that I really did n't  feel bad for my actions , so she said , " Now you are really going to get it , young man ! Your father is going to give you a spanking tonight when he gets home , after he hears how you behaved today ! " I winced at the thought , because spanking was the ultimate form of discipline in our home , and when my dad gave them to me , he really gave them to me ! <p> Mrs. Dietrich got a worried look on her face . She said , " Oh Mary , I would hate to see Dale get spanked over this ! Its really not his fault ! I am to blame for all this . Please do n't  spank him . " By her statement , it was obvious that Mrs. Dietrich did not believe in corporal punishment . And why should she ? She only had one sweet little girl who never gave her a lick of trouble . My mom said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy . I think you would see it differently if you had to out up with all the trouble Dale causes ! " She went on , " He most certainly is going to get a spanking - and a good one too ! " Mrs. Dietrich continued her plea , " Isnt there some other way to teach him his lesson ? " Obviously frustrated , my mom responded , " Oh , he never learns his lesson . We scold him , punish him , and spank him regularly , but he never shapes up ! " " So why spank him again ? " Mrs. Dietrich asked . " If you keep using the same forms of discipline , and he never learns his lesson , why keep doing them ? " she said . <p> I began to think that I was going to get out of a spanking . So , I could n't help but to get a little smile on my face . I kept hoping that Mrs. Dietrichs words might just get me out of trouble . Little did I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mom might have been persuaded to let me off the hook , but when she looked at me , she could tell what I was thinking . She said , " Oh , we have to do something to him for his bratty behavior today ! " Mrs. Dietrich got a thoughtful look on her face and then said , " Maybe Dale would respond to a different form of persuasion . " My mom asked " What do you mean ? " Mrs. Dietrich replied , " Well , in his apology to me , Dale said that my idea was n't stupid after all . That being the case , why do n't  we go through with it and put a little dress on him so he can see how it feels to be a girl ? " My mom was surprised for a moment by her unconventional idea . She asked , " Do you think that will work ? " Mrs. Dietrich responded , " I am sure it will ! - No boy would ever want to wear a dress , so I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom said , " I do n't  know " Mrs. Dietrich continued , " And , I think the punishment should fit the crime . If Dale were forced to dress like a girl , then I think he might gain a better appreciation of us girls and quit being so mean to us . " <p> Of course , I did n't  like that idea at all . Hearing the direction the conversation took was beginning to concern me . In a worried tone of voice , I told my mom , " I 'll be good , I promise ! You do n't  have to punish me that way ! " My mom shot back , " You can stay out of this ! Any ideas you have will be the last thing we are going to do ! " <p> My mom had to think about this for a moment . She looked at me and saw a fear in my face that she had never seen before when faced with any other form of punishment . Then , she looked at Mrs. Dietrich who had a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After weighing the facts she finally said , " Let 's do it ! I truly believe Dale will learn a lesson from this experience , plus it will be fun too ! " I stammered " What ! I cant believe you are taking this seriously ! " How can you do this ? " My mom responded , " Watch me ! " Then she said to Mrs. Dietrich , " What kind of dress should Dale wear ? " Mrs. Dietrich squealed , " Oh , Goody ! I have the perfect dress in mind or him ! I 'll go get it ! " <p> With that , she skipped down the hall to Michelles room . I looked back at my mom and said , " This is dumb ! I said I was sorry . Isnt that enough ? " My mom said , " No it is not , because you never really are sorry , now are you ? " I think we need to do something that will really make you truly feel sorry , and Mrs. Dietrichs idea is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I tried to get over my astonishment at this crazy idea , I had to come to grips with the sight of my selected attire . Mrs. Dietrich had returned with the girliest , most feminine dress I had ever seen ! It was a little pink dress that was just dripping in ribbons and lace . It had short puffy sleeves with white lace trim and a very short , but very full skirt radiating out from the waist . Underneath , the skirt was all poofed out with layers of sewn-in stiff white petticoats . It was by far the sissiest , most frou-frou choice Mrs. Dietrich could pull from Michelles closet . To complete the outfit , Mrs. Dietrich had also brought out a pair of girls white socks trimmed with lace , as well as a pair of little girls black patent leather shoes . My eyes nearly fell out of my head when I saw what she had . My mom said , " Oh , that is just perfect ! I cant wait to see it on him ! " Mrs. Dietrich responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held it up against me and said , " It looks to be his size too ! " Faced with this most ridiculous situation , I got my composure and said " No way ! I am not wearing that dress ! It is too sissy ! In fact , I am not going to wear any dress at all ! " My mom said " Do n't  you start again or you are just going to make it worse ! " There was no way I could conceive the situation getting any worse . I got very belligerent toward her and said , " Oh , yeah , I 'd like to see you make me ! I am not going to put it on myself , and if you &amp; Mrs. Dietrich try to put it on me , I put up a struggle like you 've never seen ! There is no way you are going to make me wear that dress ! " <p> I said this knowing I was going to get in even more trouble , but I knew I was right . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to get that dress on me . And then the only course of action my mom could take was to have my dad spank me . I did n't  like the thought of that , but it was a million times better than having to wear a dress ! <p> My mom replied very calmly and clearly , " Oh , you are going to put on that dress young man . Your punishment will be either that or no trick-or-treating this year ! It is your choice . " I was stunned by her words . No trick-or-treat ! How could she even think it ? That was the only other thing she could ever think up that could be worse than having to wear a girls dress . She had me right where she wanted me ! I was faced with the worse decision I ever had to make in all of my eight years . What should I do ? I thought maybe not going trick-or-treating might be tolerable , but after giving it some thought , I did n't  see how I could live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . As stupid as it was , I thought all I had to do was put it on for a few minutes so my mom &amp; Mrs. Dietrich could poke fun at me , and then it would be all over . No one else would have to know about me wearing Michelles dress and I could still get my big haul of candy . <p> After a few moments of tense self-deliberation , I could barley utter the words , " Give me the dress . " Mrs. Dietrich squealed , " Oh goody ! Here you go . And do n't  forget the little girl socks &amp; shoes too ! " She continued in a sarcastic tone , " I was going to grab a pair of Michelles frilly undies too , but we would n't want to embarrass you , now would we ? " In complete astonishment , I took the dress from her . She then said , " You can change in the bathroom . Its down the hall , first door on the left . " I looked at my mom one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last-moment reprieve . She just stood there sternly with an unyielding smirk on her face and said , " Snap to it ! Youve got ten minutes to get that dress on , and I 'll be waiting here to see you in it ! " With that , any remaining hope to avoid this humiliating situation was gone . I started slowly down the hall toward the bathroom . When I got there , I went in , turned on the light and closed the door . <p> I stood there , holding that frou-frou dress out in front of me wondering how I ever got into this mess . I actually had to wear this thing - and parade around in it in front of my mom and goofy neighbor ! I nearly choked at the thought of it . But , it was my only way to go trick-or-treating , so I had to do it . Just then , I heard my mom yell , " Eight minutes ! " That snapped me out of it . I took off my shoes , socks , pants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't even entirely sure how to get into it , so I just poked my head into the middle of all those short little petticoats under the skirt and kept going until my head came out the other end . I guided my arms through the same way until I found the interior of the puffy sleeves , and then through the armholes . I pulled the whole thing down until it seemed to be in place , and then I took a look in the full-length mirror on the bathroom door . There was my image of me in a pink frilly dress ! It was definitely an embarrassing experience , but I had not yet achieved my most embarrassing moment . <p> I could n't believe it ! I was wearing a dress ! I began to study how it looked on me and began to notice a kind of feel on my body that I had never encountered with any other kind of clothing . I actually began to admire how I looked in a dress . I turned from side to side to feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience for me . I think I actually almost passed out ! I could n't believe how poofy the skirt was ! This thing was sticking out from my body by a foot in all directions . I also could not believe how short the skirt was either ! It barley covered my underwear ! I tried to give it a tug downward , but the poofy petticoats underneath kept fluffing it up and out . I was so caught up in the thrill of this new experience that I did n't  really notice the slight commotion that was going on out in the living room . <p> Then I heard my mom yell , " Five minutes ! " With that , I grabbed the socks and shoes and sat down on the edge of their bathtub to put them on . When I sat down , I immediately noticed the abrupt feel of the cold porcelain against my upper thighs and butt . My underwear was touching the surface on which I was sitting ! It was like I did n't  have any pants on ! Then I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dress ! I could not believe girls had to have their underwear make unobstructed contact with the outside world . Now I understood why girls wore pretty underwear rather than the plain , boring ones us guys had to wear - with a short dress , there was always that chance that their underwear could be seen ! And if it could be seen , would n't they want them to look as pretty as their dresses ? It was such a foreign feeling to me - but actually an exciting once to my surprise . As I put on the footwear , I began to wonder what was wrong with me - Why was I actually enjoying this " punishment " ? As I tried to come to terms with this rush of thrilling emotions , I came to the conclusion , not only was this discipline better than spanking , but that it was more fun than anything I had experienced in my life ! But then , I was ashamed of myself for thinking this way . I realized , as weird as it was , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone how much I enjoyed wearing a dress . At that moment , it re-occurred to me that I was going to have to model this outfit to my mom &amp; Mrs. Dietrich . I began to tense up again at the thought of confronting them in this way . I could hear my mom counting down loudly from 10 . That was my cue . My time was up . It was time to present myself to others in this pink , frilly dress . <p> I opened the door and poked my head out into the hallway . I looked down at the other end and could see my mom sitting on a chair in the living room . She said , " Step out in the hall where I can see you dear . " I did as she said , feeling my stiff , petticoated skirt brush against the doorframe on my way out of the bathroom . I just stood there as she looked at me in Michelles dress and started to snicker and tried to keep a straight face . I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is she coming ? " My mom replied , " Here she comes now . " as she motioned for me to come towards her . I walked down the hall with a strange mix of emotions . I felt silly knowing I was going to be seen by the women in this ridiculous get-up , but at the same time , it was a thrill to feel the sway of my poofy little skirt as I walked . When I got out to the living room , all it could do was watch my mom &amp; Mrs. Dietrich gaze at me in wonderment as they started commenting on my attire . " Oh , does n't  she look pretty ! " said Mrs. Dietrich from the couch . My mom replied , " Oh , she looks just darling ! She should wear dresses more often ! " My mom commanded me to turn around to give them the whole show . I did as she said , but it was not to her satisfaction . She said " Quicker ! " This time , I gave more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies burst out in laughter . I knew they were getting more than a glimpse of my underwear . I tried in vain to pull the dress down a little further on me . Mrs. Dietrich asked me , " Does n't  it feel great to wear a dress ? " Lying to her , I replied " No . " Mrs. Dietrich said , " You have to be joking ! I think this little girl is telling us a fib , Mary ! " My mom said , " I bet she just loves her new outfit ! We are going to have to run out to the mall to get her some of her own dresses ! " As embarrassing as their teasing me was , I still had not yet reached my most embarrassing moment . <p> As much as I secretly liked wearing the dress , I felt I had just about enough of the teasing from the ladies . I told my mom , " O.K. I did what you said . You got to see me in this goofy dress and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " As I started to turn away , my mom said , " Not so fast . How about you come sit down with us and enjoy our little tea party ? " I knew there was no choice in the matter , so I grudgingly did as I was told . I walked across the living room to the empty chair in front of the large bay window . I must have looked visibly uncomfortable as I sat down , trying to mind my skirt as I did . Mrs. Dietrich said , " Is something wrong , Dale ? " I said , " Would you mind closing the curtains on this window please ? " Mrs. Dietrich responded , " Why should I do that , Dale ? Do n't  you want to show off your pretty new dress ? " I replied sarcastically , " I 'd rather not , thank you ! " Mrs. Dietrich replied , " Nonsense ! A pretty little girl like you should love showing off her frilly little dress - AND HERES YOUR CHANCE ! <p> As she said those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wonder for a moment what was going on . Then she yelled out , " O.K. GIRLS - NOW ! " At that moment , the front door swung open and standing on the stoop was Michelle and four of her friends ! It was at that moment that I realized what the slight commotion was that I was hearing from the bathroom as I put on the dress . The moms had been organizing this ambush ! All the girls came rushing into the living room squealing with delight . They all stood there pointing and laughing at the sight of that rotten Dale having to wear girly clothing ! I was humiliated ! Five girls from my class were seeing me in a pink frilly little dress ! I would never live this down ! But , as embarrassing as it was , it was still not my most embarrassing moment . <p> I immediately jumped up and tried to run out of the room . I rounded the corner to head back towards the bathroom . Mrs. Dietrich anticipated this move and jumped up too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the couch . As she was blocking my access to the hallway , I tried to stop . Since I was not used to wearing little black patent leather girls shoes , I did n't  realize what little traction they had . My feet slipped out from under me and I fell flat on my back on the floor right if front of Mrs. Dietrich . With my feet up in the air , all I could see in front of me was a bunch of pink &amp; white as my petticoated skirt flew up in my face . I immediately felt a draft around my lower extremities . My underwear was on full display to the delight of the roomful of females ! I pushed my petticoats back down as I struggled to get up . Mrs. Dietrich reached up on a high shelf and pulled down a strategically-hidden camera . She said , " This looks like a Kodak Moment to me ! " and started snapping lots of pictures . Right about then , it felt more like a Maalox moment to me ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one to see me like this - towards the kitchen . When I got there , the group of girls and moms simply followed me in so they could get some more laughs as they stared at the snotty neighborhood boy in a dress . Since there was no other place I could go in the house , I went the only place I could - out the back door ! I pushed the screen door shut behind me and held it shut in a desperate but lame effort to keep them from following me . As the girls ran through the house to the front door , Mrs. Dietrich said , " Oh , I did n't  realize you wanted to go outside to show off your new pink little dress to the whole neighborhood . Well leave you alone . " And with that she flicked the lock on the door handle and sat back , laughed , and watched me out the window as Michelle &amp; her friends ran around the side of the house to see me again in the back yard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and making fun of me - just like I had done to each them many times in the past ! One of girls behind me reached out and lifted up the skirt of my dress ! I was humiliated . They were seeing my underwear again - and much more than the occasional glimpse the short , poofy dress already allowed them to see ! As I turned away from the first offender , another one was there to yank up my dress . I felt so violated - and vulnerable ! At that point , I felt as embarrassed as I ever had felt in my life - but my most embarrassing moment had still not yet occurred . <p> Such antics must have went on in the Dietrichs back yard for several minutes , but it felt like an eternity in hell to me . Finally , my mom came to the back door , opened it , and spoke to me through the screen door . " So , now do you know how it feels to be a girl ? " " Sort of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now do you understand how it feels to be teased just because you are a girl ? " I guess so " , I replied . " Are you ready to go home now ? " she asked me . I quickly responded , " As soon as I get my own clothes on , I am ! " My mom said , " Oh , that wont be necessary just yet . " She continued , " I have your clothes right here . " as she held up a brown paper bag to show me . " I believe Mrs. Dietrich came up with a marvelous way to discipline you and I think you could use a little more time in that dress to thoroughly learn your lesson . Mrs. Dietrich was kind enough to let us borrow Michelles dress for a little while . So , not only are you going to wear it to go home , but I believe we have determined what your costume for Halloween is going to be . " Then she said , " I will still allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a little girl ! " With that , all the girls and Mrs. Dietrich laughed at the thought of my unplanned Halloween costume . As much as I initially liked putting on the dress by myself in the Dietrichs bathroom , the last thing I wanted was the humiliation of having to wear it as my costume for everyone to laugh at ! Before I could gather my thoughts to express any protest , my mom opened the screen door , stepped out , and took my hand . " Let 's go home now , dear . " she said . We started walking up the Dietrichs driveway towards the front of the house . All the girls laughed and skipped along with us as they continued to marvel at the sight of that nasty Dale in Michelles pink frilly dress . <p> If I was n't self-conscious before , I really was now , because we lived on kind of a busy road . Just when I thought it could n't get any worse , we reached the front yards and saw the Dietrichs next-door neighbor , Tony out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stopped what he was doing and whistled at me . He called out , " Nice Halloween costume ! " as we started across the street . Just then , we encountered Jennifer Walmsley riding by on her ten-speed bike . Jennifer was a local teenage girl who used to baby-sit me until she could n't take the abuse anymore . She had quit doing that job about a year ago due to my shenanigans . As she rode by , she slowed down and busted out laughing at the sight of me . When we got to the other side of the road , we saw our next-door neighbors out on their side porch , enjoying the unseasonably warm October afternoon . The Doberninks were an old retired couple who usually werent very interested in me , due to the trouble they claimed I regularly caused . But now , under these unusual circumstances , they wanted me to come speak to them . My mom guided me over to them and said , " Does n't  she look pretty in her new dress ? " She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as punishment for all the teasing I had done to all the neighborhood girls . My mom added that it was going to be my Halloween costume that I was going to wear for trick-or-treating , as well as to the costume party next Friday at school . That last part was most certainly unwelcome news to me . My mom also told them that we were going to hold onto the dress for a while after Halloween , and if my mom got any new reports of bad behavior from me , she was going to make me wear it again . The Doberninks proceeded to ask me a bunch of dumb questions like " Did I have on girls underwear too ? " My mom told me to show them , so I reluctantly had to hold up my skirt to reveal my own underwear . They continued with questions such as , " Did I like wearing a dress ? , Was this the first time I had worn a dress ? , Did I own any more dresses ? " , etc . While I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved my most embarrassing moment <p> As I answered their stupid questions , I had no idea that my mom , standing behind me , had gestured to the Doberninks that they should remain quiet as she sneaked away towards our house . After standing there for a few minutes in my neighbors yard , preoccupied with the inquiry , my mother finally called out to me from our front porch . Surprised to hear her voice calling out from that distance , I turned to face her . She said , " Well Dale , you wanted to get home to meet with your friends to discuss your Halloween plans ! So why do n't  you show them your costume ? Here they come now ! " <p> Hearing those last few words , I broke into a cold sweat as I turned to look at the front street . At that moment , all four of my best friends rode up the driveway on their bikes and pulled up along side of me , gawking at me wearing a pink frilly dress ! <p> And that was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , there is no words you can ever say to talk your way out of the fact you are wearing a pink frilly dress . I tried to explain to my friends the strange circumstances , but there was no accepting me in my sissified state . After their initial astonishment , they proceeded to have a hearty laugh at my tremendous expense , made numerous snide comments at my predicament , and then turned to ride away , leaving me alone in my humiliated state . <p> As tragic as this seemed to me at the time , the experience was beneficial to me in a couple of ways . One , I never made fun of any of the neighborhood girls ever again . The harsh lesson taught me to me a respectful , well-mannered little boy . Two , while I found being publicly displayed this way to be embarrassing , the situation introduced me to the wonderful joys of wearing pretty petticoated dresses ! <p> My mother lived up to her word and " made " me wear Michelles pretty little pink dress as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting one of her old blonde wigs on my head and putting in pigtails . She applied a little makeup to my face to achieve a greater feminine effect , and finally , she borrowed that pair of Michelles white lacy undies that Mrs. Dietrich originally suggested to wear out over top of my own underwear . Either way , showing off my own underwear or the girly ones to the world from under my short poofy petticoats was equally embarrassing . But the girls underwear gave me even more of a thrill ! I " had " to wear this outfit to my school Halloween party that next Friday . The whole school got a laugh seeing Dale dressed up as a little girl in the most feminine dress they had ever seen . Taking part in all the games and contests that day at the party was a real adventure too ! If you have ever tried running a relay race , bending over to bob for apples , or climbing to the top of a high school yard slide and slide down it while wearing a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I had to go trick-or-treating around my neighborhood that evening dressed up as a little girl too . Of course , my friends had nothing to do with me that night . They went trick-or-treating for candy without me , as they wanted no part of that Dale in his girly dress . But I was not left alone that evening . Realizing my predicament , my mother arranged with Mrs. Dietrich to have me go trick-or-treating with Michelle and her friends . They were all dressed as ballerinas , princesses , and fairies , so I fit right in with them , wearing my pink frilly dress . As I went door to door to get my treats , I got many comments from people . Most did not even realize I was a boy dressed as a girl . They would say I was a pretty girl in my beautiful pink dress , but wondered why I was n't wearing a costume . Of course , I had to explain to them that they were talking to a boy . Then I would see the looks of astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a costume . <p> Having to wear this outfit for all to see for an entire day made me get over the embarrassment of having to wear a pink frilly dress publicly . While I could have done without some of the teasing I endured , the experience made me realize that I really enjoyed wearing this pretty , poofy dress . As my mom planned , the dress did stay in our home for a couple of weeks after Halloween , in case my mom saw the need to punish me and make me wear it again . But , it was not necessary , as I had been totally reformed of my girl-teasing ways from the initial experience . And besides , wearing a dress had not really become a punishment to me anymore . While we still had Michelles dress , I would go into my room , close the door , and take her dress from my closet and put it on to wear while I played . I tried to keep this a private affair , but several times , my mom would walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad , she would just smile sweetly and let me be . <p> But eventually , my mom had to return the dress to the Dietrich 's . Although I did n't  express it outwardly , that was a sad day for me . My mom knew this , and felt bad . She hated ruining my new fun secret . So , she did the next best thing . To my surprise ( and great pleasure ) , she came home one day from the mall with several packages , claiming she had presents for me . I was curious as it was n't my birthday or Christmas yet . When I opened them , I could hardly contain my joy as I saw that she had bought me my own pink frilly dress ! This included socks , shoes , and panties too , just like Michelles outfit ! So , now I had my own dress to play in . Since it took a couple of months for my friends to get over the shock of seeing me dressed as a girl for Halloween , they had n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of having anyone else to play with , I would play with Michelle and her friends . This really was n't a problem for me any more since I had learned my lesson so effectively . I actually enjoyed playing with little girls and doing all the little girl activities . Michelle and I would go over to each others houses and play dress up , putting on pretty frilly dresses and thoroughly enjoying ourselves . Another great thing about this experience was that Michelle and I became best friends - and eventually life-long companions . After a while , my own friends started coming around again , and I resumed doing regular boy-type activities . But , I would split my time between the girl and boy realms , one day climbing trees , the next , having beautiful tea parties dressed to the nines in my pretty pink frilly dress . <p> This went on for a few years . Eventually , I outgrew my dress and there was no new one to replace it . My mother never seemed to worry about me having a " girly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support this behavior when I got older . It was never really a problem in her mind , but rather just a stage that she thought I would eventually get over . That was one thing she was wrong about - I never really got over my love of wearing pretty frilly dresses . When she introduced me to the wonderful world of frou-frou feminine attire that day so many years ago when she punished me as a child , she had no idea how that event would effect me for the rest of my life . As an older child , I would secretly poke around in her closet and try on her clothes when no one else was home . This continued into my teens when I began experiencing the joys of adult womans dresses , petticoats , brassieres , stockings , garter belts , high-heeled pumps , etc . <p> As Michelle and I continued our friendship through the years , our relationship turned into dating . All the while , she was always aware of my love for wearing pretty womens clothes and never once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women would probably have a problem with the guy they were dating if they knew he dressed in womens clothing . But since she had been involved in this matter from the beginning during our childhoods and was present during most of its evolution , she never recognized the situation as a problem . <p> We went to our senior prom together and had a wonderful time . She wore the most beautiful feminine dress I had seen , since the day I donned her pretty pink childhood dress . I think she intentionally selected a pink prom dress to wear that evening with beautiful white petticoats filling it out underneath . She did this as a reminder of that special moment years ago and the many fun dress-up times we had together thereafter . That evening , after the dance , we had a wonderful time at a local motel , dressing me up entirely in her outfit including Michelles lingerie , petticoats , heels , etc . We proceeded to make the evening extra special by venturing into the first sexual encounter for both of us . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives together by eventually getting married . I knew there was no other woman for me . I loved her dearly and knew no other woman would understand , support , and encourage my " hobby " the way Michelle did . Presently , in our adult lives , I continue to dress up in womens clothes . With my wifes help , I wear the most beautiful feminine outfits . I especially love full petticoated skirts . But , as many of us know , this style has gone the way of sock-hops and drive-in movies . Petticoats are difficult to find now in this modern era . But , because of this modern era , I was able to discover the Pettipond website . Thank god for the Internet ! Now I can appreciate the lost art of wearing petticoats by viewing others pleasures in this fetish and ordering my own to wear . I am able continue my lifelong tradition of wearing full petticoated dresses and skirts that started so long ago in my childhood . What had started out as my most embarrassing moment has become a life long thrill ! 
@@37517556 @6517556/ <p> As I write this I am a 42 year old heterosexual single man . I have sensed all my life that I was different from other men but it was only recently that I became aware of why . <p> When I grew up I was an only child . I was taught no social skills by my parents and had a very difficult time getting along with others . I became extremely shy and withdrawn and developed a strong aversion to even touching other people . I believe that I learned this from my parents because they are not touchy type people . I remained in this state for many years and had an extremely difficult time functioning as an adult . I never dated , even though I was quite attracted to women because I had very serious emotional problems related to my sexuality and sense of identity . I spent a very lonely life . <p> About 1990 I got fed up with the situation since things were not getting better as I was getting older , but worse , and decided to seek some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , especially my mother opposed it . My mother is quite domineering and it took me years to figure out how to deal with her . Now I just ignore her if I do n't like something and she no longer runs my life , although she still tries . After about a year and a half of therapy my first therapist got me past a lot of sexual hangups and I began to date . Unfortunately I did not find the love of my life and within a year began to be frustrated again . Since I was n't landing an actual woman I decided to at least have a few women 's things around the house . I decided to mail order some lingerie late in 1992 . I really just bought the first few things to play with , but I found I enjoyed wearing them . I had bought the things for erotic purposes and quickly found they were an extremely poor substitute for a real woman . While the lingerie was a failure as an erotic substitute I liked the way the garments felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the lingerie for erotic purposes and assumed for years that it had quite a bit of erotic value , theyt actually has turned out to have very limited erotic value for me . <p> Since I liked the garments I ordered some more lingerie and some nightgowns . My favorite nightgowns quickly became the long sleeved satiny Vanity Fair gowns . I enjoyed running my hands over the material , but the touch thing still was not sinking in . Some of the lingerie I ordered was Fredericks of Hollywood type stuff , which had some visual appeal but which felt terrible to wear as the material was quite stiff and hard . I found that the everyday lingerie which is designed and made to be worn by real women on a daily basis felt much better . My favorite lingerie quickly became women 's body briefers or all in ones that fit snug against my torso and hug me . <p> At the beginning of 1993 I had a new therapist . This man observed my mannerisms and told my about the three primary sensory orientations that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vast majority of people are visual , there are a lot fewer auditory people and not too many people whose primary orientation is tactile . He said that most of the tactile types were women and that women tend to have more emphasis on touch than men do even when it is not there primary sense . This made sense because I knew how soft and nice my lingerie felt , and it was made to be worn by women . He told me that he thought I was primarily an auditor . I still had a strong aversion to touch at that point which he probably observed and I definitely am not a visual person . I tremendously enjoy music and while I am a rather poor musician I am slowly learning about it . While I can learn about music there is no way that anyone could teach me to be an artist . I have a friend who is an artist and I do n't have the slightest idea of how he does what he does . I also remember that I was always kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite intelligent but never figured out how to do visual art because I am just not visual . I accepted my conclusion that I was an auditory person since it made perfect sense at the time . <p> In the fall of 1993 I began taking square dance lessons . I was hoping to find a nice lady to date but I enjoyed square dancing enough that I kept at it even after I discovered that I was not likely to find a young enough woman to really date in square dancing . Square dancing is very touchy . You have to hold hands with all of the other dancers . I had quite an aversion to it at first but since everyone else was doing it I got to accept it , and finally even enjoy it . I was also intrigued by the beautiful petticoats the women wore , and while I thought in the back of my mind that it might be fun to try one on sometime I did not know why I felt that way and it was not a strong enough urge to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found what I thought was the love of my life and tried to marry her in 1996 . She was a square dancer and seemed quite nice . While she said yes at the altar she said no after that . After several months of frustration she moved out and I had the marriage annulled . This really crushed my male ego . I was pretty old ( 40 ) for a first marriage and wound up with a woman who would not love me . I feel sorry for her because she has serious emotional problems which are much worse than I ever had . I stood by her long after I should have terminated the relationship but she finally decided she would rather move out than get therapy . So I wound up single again and felt really stupid for not having seen it coming . Well I guess there is a reason they say love is blind ... <p> Early in 1998 I became a Poufbunny almost by accident . I decided as a gag to go to a square dance cross dressed . ( See my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the outfit , and especially the petticoat felt , and soon had purchased several outfits . I still really was not sure what I liked about women 's wear . At the same time I started getting regular massages from a good friend of mine who is a nurse , a registered massage therapist and also a square dancer . We had several discussions about how I liked the massages and I told her that I really liked them . It still had not sunk in that all of these things I liked were related to my sense of touch . I dressed up in a women 's square dance outfit for my friend and she really got a kick out of seeing me dolled up . I got her to twirl me several times and I realized that being twirled in a petticoat is a very sensual ( and I do not mean erotic ) experience . I realized that the women in square dancing were having far more fun with those petticoats that they let on to us guys . The women friends that I questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the felt with the only problem being that the combination of pantyhose , pettipants and a full petticoat can be quite hot in the summer . <p> Over the next few weeks I slowly digested all of the years of experiences that I had with the lingerie , square dancing , wearing a petticoat and liking how it felt , as well as a few other experiences which I have not gone into . I finally realized that my primary sense is touch . All of a sudden everything made sense . While I had not felt really guilty about wearing lingerie or a woman 's square dance outfit before ( although I felt stupid for spending money on women 's things which did not appear to have any practical use ) I suddenly felt much better about it because I understood why all of these things were in my life . Women 's lingerie and the nice frilly square dance outfits do have a very practical use in my life - they touch me and are equally nice to touch . It is amazing how much can strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are . I have been using various things to meet my need to be touched for several years now withoug being cognizant of my deep need to touch and be touched . <p> Now I know that I have received a rare gift that very few men have . I have observed how many of my women friends complain that there husbands or boyfriends wo n't touch them or have an aversion to being touched . Knowing that I am a toucher now has gone a long way to healing my male ego which was seriously hurt by my failed marriage . As much as women enjoy touching and being touched I know that the fact that I am a toucher should make me quite attractive to a lot of women , where I have always felt unattractive to women until now . <p> Whether I find my special someone or not I can still always look forward to the times when I can put on my lingerie and a square dance outfit with a nice full petticoat ( I wear 80 yard ones and these are absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . While I will have to admit that dressing up does have a certain visual appeal ( I have some absolutely beautiful outfits ) they mainly supply what I really need , which is a symphony of touch . <p> If what I have said helps anyone else , whether a Poufbunny or not , awaken their hidden need to touch and be touched then I am glad . It took me long enough to find out who I am and I thank God for finally showing me . If you have the gift of touch then be thankful that you have it and that you have found it . It was given to you especially by God and should be treated with the respect due to all of the good things God has given us.

I settled on this name because it gave a better idea of my passion for the 50 's silhouette and wide poofy fashion . I 've been on many computer services in the past 10+ years , sometimes known as " Trudy " or " Crinoline " . <p> But enough about my name , now about my passion ..... <p> I can remember being " dressed " by an older sister at about age 5 . She dressed me in a black silk lined short gown , but at my size it was floor length . We played house on an enclosed back porch with her dressed also . <p> There were several times that this happened but I remember only sketchy accounts of them . Later on in my younger days I remember being quite envious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they wore dresses buoyed out by petticoats . Eventually the fad faded , the school now required students to be in uniform and nothing was the same . <p> The Easter Holiday did bring a noticeable increase in younger relatives that still wore the cute little girl bouffant dresses . Even on Christmas it was a pleasure to see the younger cousins in their wide-skirted dresses . I remember quite well one cousin who wore a winter outfit with snow pants and a long full coat over her bouffant dress . I could not figure out at the time " why the snow pants ? " , but later understood that it must get cold on one 's behind if the only thing they had on under the petticoats was a pair of rumba panties . <p> Later on the fashions were pretty much changed and all of those wonderfully frothy garments were disposed of in ways that make me cringe . All except four that I intercepted from a neighbor 's donation to the Salvation Army . I can remember them quite well , there were two size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately they were not the type with layers and layers of crinoline but rather the polished cotton-like material with ruffles of crinoline and lace sewn on them in tiers . I fit into them up until I was about fourteen . Then I discovered a treasure in my own attic ! My older sister , now away at college , had three long bouffant prom/bride 's maid gowns and a bouffant half slip stored there . Needless to say they fit me and I have many wonderful memories of sneaking up the attic to wear them . <p> Then there was a " un-petticoated " part of my life for about 10 years . This ended with Square Dance Classes and becoming a part owner , so-to-speak , of a Square Dance Shop . I was in heaven and wished the petticoats were of the type with an attached bodice . I fondly remembered those little girl slips like that and still , to-this-day , wonder why these were never made in that style . <p> Well , a divorce ended the partnership , and I became the owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that group . I did meet a partner that had a sense of imagination , lived with her for several years and we enjoyed many " special " variations including my fondness for petticoats .

Notice the bridal slips hanging on the door ? That dress was poufed up by three petticoats ! The hair was from the " lady " Halloween get-up . <p> Well eventually her want of variations did the relationship in .

I 'm still searching for the elusive " pneumatic petticoat " pictured elsewhere on the Petticoat Pond pages . <p> I could write a book , but I 'd better stop for now . <p> And how old am I ?

She agreed , but suggested I wear a pair of her school knickers to go with it and a petticoat underneath . I was 15 at the time and Megan was 14 and a bit shorter , so her skirt was quite a bit shorter than a boy 's kilt . On the day of the concert , Mum dressed me in first the knickers , which were navy blue , and then the white petticoat that made the skirt flare out ; then I wore white knee length socks with black Mary Jane shoes an Megan 's school blazer that had her name written on it .

After the movie was over , Judy tried to save the evening , and their friendship , by suggesting they all go over the Martin 's . " Hey , let 's go to Martin 's and get a soda ! " Judy winked at Carolyn and Carolyn understood . " Yes ! Good idea , let go . " replied Candy When they arrived at Martin 's , Judy picked out a booth and told Peter to slide in .

Candy found herself sitting so close to David that it was all she could do to keep her hands to herself ! Candy found herself getting very excited ! Now things began to get interesting . Candy 's very bouffant skirt was pressing up against David and David seemed to like it . Judy leaned toward her boyfriend and said , " Hey Davy ! Does Candy 's skirt leave any room for you ? " " I 'm fine . " replied David . The sound and the feel of her crinolines was getting him excited . " Candy always wears the biggest skirts in school , you know . Ask her ! ... Go ahead ! .... Ask her how many petticoats she 's wearing . " David looked embarrassed . Candy turned to David and answered before he could ask . " I 'm wearing four tonight . " " See ! " exclaimed Judy . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn made a bold move . She raised herself up in her seat .

Her petticoats and skirt came to rest across the table top and up the back of her seat and all over David . Then Candy quickly sat back down . Judy giggled hysterically at Carolyn 's bouffant show . She looked at her boyfriend and said , " Davy ! It looks like you 're wearing Candy 's skirt !

Buried deep beneath four layers of nylon and lace , David 's hand slowly slid along the red vinyl upholstered seat ; slowly shortening the distance between his hand and Candy 's luscious thighs . Candy made a quick , sharp , gasp when she felt David 's touch , but Judy just went on talking and noticed nothing . Candy looked at David out the corner of her eye and gave him a naughty smile . David knew he was being encouraged so he became more bold . Candy tried to control herself so Judy would n't discover that her boyfriend was cheating on her ; right in front of her face !

Candy pretended to be listening intently at every word Judy was saying but it was becoming increasingly more difficult as David 's fingers began playing with the delicate white lace trim on the leg bands of Candy 's pale pink panties . The twitching of her thighs only added to the erotic pleasure David felt . Just then their waitress came over and David had to retreat for the moment . " What-a-ya gun-na have ?

Poor dumb Judy seemed confused by the waitress 's indignant remark . David spoke up and said , " I Just want a plain coke , please . " The waitress walked away laughing quietly to herself . Judy looked at her boyfriend , and with a little peevishness in her voice , she said , " What did she mean by that ? " David shrugged his shoulders and said , " I have no idea ! She must be crazy ! " Judy acccepted that answer as fact and continued with her gossip . David 's hand moved back across the seat and Candy smiled , devilishly , when she felt his touch return .

When at last she felt his fingers stroke her there , she let out a big gasp ! Judy stopped talking and said , " There you go again ! Are you sure you 're okay ? " " Yes ! I 'm fine ! Why do you keep asking me that ? " Candy replied defensively . " You 're acting funny . " Peter injected . Candy lost her temper and jabbed back " Mine your own business !

She did n't know what was happening to her best friend and she was scared until she looked at David . David 's eyes were closed . He was licking his lips and breathing hard . " David !

The procedure that I have used is to dissolve a 1 kg bag of sugar in a bucket 10 litres/2 gallons of warm water . Then dunk the petticoat under the water until it is fully immersed . Leave to soak for about half an hour , or until the petticoat is thoroughly wetted ( with paper nylon sometimes it takes longer ) . Remove the petticoat , and hang up to drip dry over a bath .

These actions may be performed in an erotic or " come hither " manner , while retaining options for withdrawal if necessary . Suffice it to say that techniques such as those discussed here fortify the argument that a clothed figure is far more enticing and attention-getting than pure nudity . It is a lesson for the ages . <p> Since the skirt obviously covers the legs , these are the parts of the body , which may be used to best effect , sometimes in conjunction with the hands . Let us take this common scenario for example . <p> You have walked into an auditorium , fairly late , but not overly so . There is a dearth of seating , but you spy a spot in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best you can do . You approach the targeted row and say , in a sweet tone , to the gentleman sitting in the end seat , " Excuse me , I 'm so sorry . " Entering the row , you gather up your skirts and pettis in front of you , occasionally letting parts of them drop just enough to sweep across the legs of anyone you deem attractive -- just to give a hint . People sitting in the row in front of your row are , of course , in jeopardy , but an intelligent lady can figure on whom to bestow the honors and who to avoid at all costs . Of course , you have prepared for this entire situation by assuring that your petticoats and skirts have been imbued with your favorite cologne or perfume . The movement of the skirts and underpinnings will push this fragrance in the direction intended , and further enhance the moment ( s ) . <p> You finally get to your intended seat , leaving behind a trail of devastation in the hearts of men ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of sitting . The man on one side is appealing , so you make sure that , as you sweep your myriad skirts under your derriere , the majority of them " accidentally " end up brushing , and even residing on his legs . Should this not occur on initially sitting down , you may certainly accomplish this end-result later , as you ( apparently ) accidentally push your skirts and petticoats in his direction whilst " engrossed " in the happenings on stage . It would be a very strange fellow indeed who would object or even draw attention to what happened by asking you to kindly remove your clothing from his person . Chances are , he would be titillated ? you would make his day ! If you are the adventurous type , and don ? t mind a cold feeling on your bottom , you might want to sit down with your skirts billowing around you ( and up your back ! ) .

A little leg , a little frou-frou . wow ! <p> At work , reach up to a high shelf to retrieve an item , while standing on a chair . This can stop any man in his tracks , but ascertain that that special man is passing by . Calling for help as you begin to fall OFF that chair can lead to some interesting situations , especially if the rest of the men in the office see your petticoats a-flyin ? as you fall into his arms ! <p> In a similar technique , drop something on the floor not too far away from your voluminous skirts and strategically timed so that that hunk is standing nearby .

As you thank him , you whisk away , your taffeta underskirts rustling in the concocted breeze . <p> Ah ! Yes ! The sound . <p> That is another of the attributes enjoyed by petticoat wearers . Taffeta IS best for those seductive sounds , but enough layers of any material will bring a small sound , one that is exciting . One that entices ! " Paper " nylon ( not seen often nowadays in petticoats ) is another material with its own distinctive sound as it rubs against your stockings . <p> Imagine yourself sitting in the front row of a church , fully arrayed in your crinoline best .

Crinolines must be treated with a little more care in terms of abusing other peoples ? personal space . After all , hard-shelled skirts can even hurt if bounced in the wrong direction . Also , they may be harder to handle and not behave quite in the manner intended , since these delightful garments retain their own shape , and not necessarily that of whatever they might be leaning on . Keep in mind that a girl must balance flirtatiousness and common courtesy . <p> Most women have absolutely NO concept concerning the power of dress .

Aunty Joan was both notoriously short-sighted and deaf and , with a bit of luck , would n't spot that I was n't really Tina at all . Maybe after a sit down on her sofa and a cup of tea , I might be refreshed sufficiently to be able to walk back home with Mum still dressed in Tina 's party frock , stockings and so on <p> However , although I might have looked like my twin sister Tina in some respects , my face still looked just like the Timmy I really was . So I had said , ' Mum , do you realise I just wo n't look like Tina at all , unless I wear a wig and some make-up to disguise me ? I know auntie is a bit short-sighted , but even she will work out that it 's Timmy and not Tina in the red frock ! ' ' <p> ' Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knows-all tones of voice .

The wig came off one of the mannequin models and it was actually a bit big for me , so Miss Fotheringale found a sort of tight skull-cap thing that fitted over my head , to which the inside of the wig was pinned securely . <p> I had been most wary about how I would look but once I had seen myself in the mirror of the change room , I was totally convinced nobody especially short-sighted Auntie Joan would detect that I really was n't her favourite niece ' Tina ' home early from her boarding school . I really looked so perfect it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distance in Tina 's frock , along with heels and all the other stuff ? <p> 6 . ONE GIANT STEP FOR A YOUNG MAN <p> I was soon to find out how difficult it is to walk in a frock and heels out in the open air . Walking up and down on the catwalk in the Frock Salon had been dead easy in comparison . However , outside it was quite a breezy sort of day and the red frock and lacy petticoats seemed determined to be blown upwards by each gust of wind . Mum told me to keep my right arm down by my side , to prevent any unfortunate display of my stockings and underwear courtesy of the breeze . <p> I 'd have liked to have kept both my left and right arms down by my sides to prevent such occurrences , but my left arm was already committed to carrying the black handbag which Mum had chosen to complement my patent black leather low-heeled court shoes . <p> We had to cross the main road and walk past the cycle shop opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike in the window that I dearly would love to own . Somehow seeing it again and knowing that it was getting closer to becoming mine , courtesy of the feminine frock and undies I was wearing right then , made me more resolute in getting this visit to Aunt Joan 's over and done with . <p> My black shoes had metal tips on the heels and gave that characteristic ' click , clack ' sound that I had heard so often from ladies out walking , but now the shoe was literally on the other foot mine ! Mum and I continued our walk up the other side of the High Street , before turning off at Coronation Drive , which was where Auntie Joan lived . However , just as we turned off , an even bigger gust of wind came up and , despite my best efforts , the hem of Tina 's frock blew up , along with the lacy petticoats . As bad luck would have it , several teenage guys were walking along the other side of the road at exactly that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw my stocking tops and underwear on full display . I could have died , there and then , but what to do ? Mum just whispered . ' Ignore them , Timmy ! Just keep walking . Now you know what we ladies have to put up with all the time from you men ' <p> So we turned off into Coronation Drive and I was so glad to see Auntie Joan 's terraced house not far away on the left side . My feet and ankles were really starting to hurt from the unfamiliar walking in heeled shoes they 'd been subjected to for about 20 minutes . I was hoping to get this charade over just as soon as I could , not only to earn myself the additional five pounds from mum towards my bicycle fund , but to finally get out of those high heel shoes , bra , girdle , frock and so on . Masquerading as my twin sister Tina was fast losing any attraction it might have once held ..

@@37517580 @6517580/ <p> I grew up in the 1950s era as a school lad when those wonderful petticoat creations were around . My favourites are those that rustle and swish in paper nylon or paper taffeta . Why I took to wearing them and touching them is that very reason the feel and , particularly , the rustle of paper nylon really arouses me still today as well . I can recall an incident : I was only 12 at the time and had to go and do an errand for one of my late sister 's lady friends . On my arrival at her flat , she asked me in for coffee and doughnuts , which I accepted most gleefully . Whilst she was in the kitchen getting the coffee ready , I spied her lovely can-can petticoat lying on the sofa . It was in 4-tiered pale blue paper nylon . I went over to it , and touched it . The cool smooth paper nylon rustled and crackled , giving me a tremendous thrill . I longed to try it on or rustle it in my hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes and I got caught red-handed . I thought she would have gotten very angry with me , but she just smiled and replied that , as I seemed to like her petticoat she would put it on for me after we had our coffees . When we finished , she took the petticoat and changed in her bedroom . A few minutes later , she came out wearing a full black moirT taffeta calf-length skirt with big moirT mark patterns and with her pale blue paper nylon petticoat peeking out underneath . Oh ! THE RUSTLE SOUND WAS HEAVEN ! Paper nylon against taffeta sounds gorgeous . This got me very aroused . I said she looked stunning and she was very flattered . With a gorgeous rustle , she drew back her skirts to reveal yards of crisp paper nylon in pale blue . I asked her to rustle the petticoat . Smiling , she grabbed several folds and rubbed them hard together so the paper nylon really screamed . I could not stand it any longer , so I asked her if I could try her petticoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She agreed right away , and I had to swear to secrecy about this , because if my sister found out or my mum , there would be trouble ! <p> I did , drawing the curtains in the bedroom . She made me take off my clothes to just my underpants and then . she slipped off her petticoat , holding it out for me to step into . I got the greatest arousal of my life as I felt the yards of cool smooth paper nylon around my legs and heard the rustle it made . She smiled at me and then went to her wardrobe , where she brought out another petticoat , this time in white paper taffeta , with lemon lace ; this one had 3 big tiers . She proceeded to make this one rustle for me by again rubbing the folds hard together so they really scream-rustled . It was no good I wanted to relieve my arousal , so i asked if I could do so by her and I rustling the petticoat and taffeta skirt . She could see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreed , so we had a wonderful time . She occasionally showed me her stocking tops and her blue briefs , which aroused me even more . Finally , Ii had to leave , but quite often when I had to go and visit her for my sister , we would have lovely rustle and wearing sessions . I asked if I could have her pale blue paper nylon petticoat when she had finished with it . She agreed , but sadly , to this day , Ii did not get i . But I shall always recall that wonderful era of the 1950s . <p> PART TWO <p> In 1957 , in our house , we got a TV set , of course , only black and white then . One of the programs I watched was some dancing , weekly ballroom competitions . My favorite was the Latin section ; the dresses the women wore then were far more sexy than now - strapless bodice ( or not ) with a full , knee-length skirt , the dress usually in taffeta or satin over paper nylon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced the jive or cha-cha , her skirt would rustle and flair out , revealing her tight knickers , usually briefs . This was most erotic to me - I only wish VCRs has been invented then . After the show ended , I went off to bed . <p> I was now 13 years old ; as I lay in bed , I began to rustle the paper nylon petti my sister had given me , as she had gotten a new one . There , I recalled what I had seen on TV earlier . Trouble was , my mom had very acute hearing , and on her way to bed , she heard the rustling sounds through my bedroom door . She stormed into my bedroom , tore back the bedclothes , and snatched the petticoat wrapped around my aroused member . Giving me a hefty clout , and calling me a filthy pervert , she threatened that if I ever got caught again with women 's things , she would take me to the doctor to give me a cure for my urges . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture , from him this time . But this only made me more determined . My mum had thrown the petticoat away in the dustbin , but I did manage to get another paper nylon one from the second-hand shop . I hid this one well away , and she never did find it . My sister married by now , had a lovely baby boy , and her neighbor 's daughter , on Sundays , if the weather was fine , would take him out in his buggy . This daughter , whose name M**** , was a very attractive girl , aged about 12 to 14 . <p> Well , on one Sunday , she popped around to take my sister 's boy out . I was there also on a visit . The outfit she had on made her look stunning - she wore a white pique revere collar blouse , black belt at the waist , with a full knee-length skirt of candy striped blue and white poplin and nylons and white court shoes . It was her skirt that was arousing - as she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath . There was a quick glimpse of lace and paper taffeta - she was wearing a hooped version . Now she had really aroused me . She was dynamite , and she had lit my fuse . I could do nothing - I jut exploded in my underwear , before it shrank like a popped balloon . <p> Well , off we went , out to the local park with my sister 's child . At the top of the street , she stopped for a moment , and bent over to adjust the pushchair straps . As she did so , her skirt swung up I got a lovely view up her skirt - folds of paper nylon , stocking tops , and the crotch of her lemon briefs . Its funny , I do n't know how she knew , for the following Sunday , she confronted me about it , and threatened to inform everyone . But in the end , she forgave me , and when she was on her own indoors , she and I had lovely rustle sessions with her hooped paper taffeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our old bathroom geyser had finally broken down , so , til we got a new one , my dear pal invited me to his house to take a bath .

I said yes , and in she came , closing the door . She looked wonderful , dressed up in a voile blouse , full black taffeta skirt with red roses on it , over paper nylon with lemon lace , and dark sheer nylons . She was going out . The rustle of her skirts really aroused me ! After she had washed me , I asked if I could look at her pettis , etc . <p> Smiling , she drew back her skirts with a lovely rustle , revealing her stocking tops and her lavender briefs .

Come to think of it , I 'm not sure I 'll ever completely understand it myself , but here goes . She was a little over a year older that me , but because of how our birthdays fell , she was two school grades ahead of me . When we were little , we played together a lot with all the other kids in our neighborhood . There were about a dozen of us , who hung out for what seemed like endless summers , playing kickball , exploring the woods out back , riding bikes to a nearby lake for swimming - I guess we had a lot more freedom in those days than most kids today . Our folks definitely did n't feel the need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different era , in a small town setting , and there was an enormous amount of trust that we all had in each other . <p> Anyway , as the years went by , we all gradually drifted apart .

She started hanging out with an older crowd , and getting into art and music and social issues . By the time she hit high school , her parents had caught her smoking pot , and a " Girl , Interrupted " situation evolved . They checked her into a troubled teens rehab place for half the summer . I guess that whole experience helped her in a way to see who her real friends were . The next school year , I noticed her being friendlier to the old gang .

When I called her , I told her I had a " big , big problem " and I needed her help right away , but that she had to promise that she would never tell a soul . She got concerned , and was asking did I kill someone , did I start a fire , did I steal money , what was it ?

" I just have to make sure these other loose threads are out of the way .

@@37517586 @6517586/ <h> MAKING YOUR OWN PETTICOATS <p> There is nothing quite like wearing a silky ballgown over lots of petticoats . The feeling of sheer femininity that all that skirt gives can be quite wonderful , and the sensation of feeling lots of petticoats swishing about you can be ecstatic . The problem is it can be expensive , and most shop bought pettis are rarely full enough if you like your skirts big . <p> One answer is to make your own . This is fairly easy providing you are careful and keep the geometry right . The simplest and most versatile skirt to make is circular , it can be worn on its own , or can be the basis of a variety of petticoats , simply add frills as desired . <p> The success of a circular skirt depends on having a decent pattern . This can be paper , but card or even hardboard or thin ply is much more durable ( well you 're not going to stop at one skirt are you ? ) <p> So take a square of say hardboard about 4feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a small nail or panel pin and either drill a hole or knock the pin in about 1/2 inch from one corner but leave it sticking out a bit . Now if you remember back to your school days you might remember some some geometry , To recap it , is a curious fact that the diameter ( the distance across ) goes into the circumference ( the distance round ) about 3 times ( actually its 22/7 or 3.14 but 3 is near enough for our purposes ) . So measure your waist and divide by three and then half it cause you want half the diameter or the radius . This is the main dimension to make it fit your waist . <p> However to allow for seams etc. or if you are using a drawstring you might want to make it a bit bigger ( by an inch or two ) . Next take this dimension and mark a point this distance from the pin ( it should have worked out at about 7-10 inches ) . <p> Take a piece of string or ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen or pencil and holding it on the mark pull the string tight and wrap the free end round the pencil and keeping the string tight mark a quarter of a circle in the corner of the card or hardboard . <p> Next decide how long you want your skirt to be and add your hem allowance and draw another quarter circle . Cut this out and you have a template or pattern . Four of these shapes will give you a circular skirt ( You could of course use more than four ) , and the distance of the pin from the edges is your seam allowance ! <p> When deciding on the length , remember its usual to make the petticoat a little shorter than the skirt , and also you may need to make each petticoat longer than the one underneath , and the top skirt even longer ! If you do n't , you may end up with an old time dance dress of a few years ago . To be safe make the template longer than you think you will need as you can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a petticoat , take some fabric and cut out the four panels ( you could fold in half and cut two . Sew them together , usually inside out , and hem the bottom . Check the length is OK and sew a waistband around the top . Thread a ribbon through the waistband , try on and admire your handiwork ! <p> The correct fabric is all important , and half the enjoyment of making your own petticoats is you get to choose , experiment , the most unlikely fabrics can feel delicious , and also the most gorgeous can feel horrible so do n't buy too much at once ! <p> So far all you have is a waist slip and with a device called a ruffler , whom you can get for a domestic sewing machine , you can easily add frills and flounces . Do n't overdo this as its better to make several petticoats than one massive one . As a guide , 100 yards of net added to three petticoats will puff out a full-length skirt to Victorian dimensions . However if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you have a partner , use something much silkier .

They had moved , and their mother did not like the local public school , so she sent them to an all-girls school . But they had to wear uniforms .

He was kept out of little league and was not allowed to see those friends any more . She still thought she could handle him as a boy , reading to him about petticoat punishment , both real and fictional . It is not that she disagreed with the method - she did n't  , and both she and her late husband just thought of it as a last resort . <p> So when was the last resort ? After his grounding ended and the children were sent to a co-ed sleep-away for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and pushed her face in the dirt , and the counselors , both male and female could not handle him .

We have an idea , we saw it on the Internet , we will let the female counselors tell you about it . We know you are a doctor ; we would pay you for the summer - double your standard fee - if you stay here . " <p> So the males left and the husband of the owner left , too ; Kevin-andy and the women stayed . <p> " We found this web site on petticoat punishment for unruly boys . " <p> " I know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort , as did my late husband . We never thought we would have to do it to Kevin ; he was a good boy and his behavior bordered on girlish . He even let his twin sister dress him up a couple of times and never complained . But when his father died I could not handle it . I took him to counselors , both male and female , my colleagues , but they both said he would not out grow this - he just looked at it as his father deserting him . You have to do something drastic . We will not medicate him you know that . We do not believe in it , that is why you took him to us . " <p> " So they told me about doing this and I knew about this , but rejected it .

Now go to your sister 's bunk house - debbie is her counselor she will be in charge of you as all the girls will . " <p> He was beside himself . His hair was blonde and long and it was easy to make a girl hairstyle and put his hair in pig tails with a pink ribbon on each one and a big pink bow on the top of his head .

" <p> They all knew it was Kevin-andy and that he was being punished , but the girls did not tease him , which was strange . They sort of felt sorry for him . Instead they treated him like one of the girls . It was late , 10:30 pm , so they went to sleep - they should have gone the bed long ago . Karen- ann slept on the top bunk , over her sister .

@@37517595 @6517595/ <p> " Bouffant Girl " memories and commentary about growing up in the fifties <p> I was privileged to wear some of Tessy 's 50s collection for a brief time . It brought back memories . I was fortunate that my family was quite well off so , as a girl , I enjoyed having lots of skirts , dresses and petticoats . Tessy 's collection reminded me of how beautiful most of those early petticoats were . I have never seen a petticoat manufactured today that looks anything like the beautiful petticoats I used to wear in the 50s and early 60s . <p> Two basic groups of bouffant girls <p> In the nineteen fifties we were all raised to be ladies and we mostly turned out that way , but in many different degrees . Among the girls that regularly wore petticoats , there were a variety of personalities and attitudes concerning the bouffant fashion , so what I am about to tell you did vary in degrees . <p> I think that I can safely say that there were two very distinct groups . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more then underwear . Their choice in petticoats was generally more on the practical side . Pretty was nice , but not necessary . This type of girl mostly wore a white petti and they were always very guarded with their skirts . They were petticoat girls mostly to be fashionable . <p> The second group of girls , of which I belonged , did n't feel that way at all . They considered their petticoats to be a part of their skirts ; the pretty part . We loved the feel and the sound they made and the subconscious idea that our petticoats were attracting attention to our legs . <p> A true story <p> There was a girl in the eighth grade named Viola , and her last name was impossible to spell or pronounce . Viola was a girl of the second kind . She was a bouffant queen and there always seemed to be a contest going on between her and her girlfriend , Marie , as to who had the biggest skirt . Viola was flamboyant . She loved the beauty of her petticoats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoats , she was not afraid to show pouf , and often did . <p> The old school rooms had seats and desks that were permanently attached to the floor . Because of this , petticoat girls had their own way of seating down in a lady-like manner . But Viola had more skirt to deal with . She would grasp her petticoats through her skirt with both hands , and in one lightening move , she would lift her petticoats up and over her desk and sit quickly in her seat . She would then push her crinolines down around her legs . I know ! It was not very lady-like , but it worked for Viola . It was a move that a few lucky boys who were fortunate to be sitting in strategic seats really enjoyed . I heard reports that she often showed a lot of her thighs alone with the occasional flash of her panties . This was all framed in a shower of petticoats and only lasted a few seconds . <p> I believe there was a mention of the cancan some time back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but back then the cancan was a naughty little fascination of quite a few schoolgirls of the era . The idea of wearing all those pretty and colorful petticoats and doing such a naughty , teasing dance was tantalizing and thrilling ! Girls always love and need attention . We like to be looked at because we 're pretty , but also we like to believe we can sexually excite as well . It 's just the way we 're made . I do not know of any girl , back then , that actually played out their cancan fantasy , but I know that somewhere some girls did . However , get a few of us girls together , and if there were no boys around , a cancan dance would often break out and believe me , it was a regular giggle fest . <p> School dance 1958 <p> A seventh grade boy , Dan I think his name was , was sitting on the grass at the edge of the school playground and he was leaning against an old maple tree . He was sitting alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me that a girl in his class named Cathy came over to where he was sitting and she began bop dancing , apparently to a rock and roll song in her head . He said that she would twirl her petticoats out as she danced and , as she danced , she would move closer to where he was sitting . She never looked at him , just danced . Then he said she twirled around and around really fast exposing her panties , after which she stopped and left him alone . He asked me if I knew why Cathy did that . So I asked him , " Are you going to the school dance next Friday ? " He replied , " I do n't know . " " What do you mean , you do n't know ? " I retorted . He said that he had n't asked anyone . " Well , " I told him , " there 's your answer . " He gave me a puzzled look , so I said , " Cathy wants you to ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a Lot of talk here , on The Pond , about petticoats and slips showing . I do n't disagree with any of the things said , but the reason why it was a no-no was a simple one . My skirt was pretty . My petticoats were pretty . My petticoat passing my hem was just sloppy ; and no girl wants to look sloppy . At least that used to be true . <p> But petticoats were designed to be pretty because petticoats were made to be seen and enjoyed . But how can you see my petticoat hidden under my skirt ? Let 's see . <p> Some girls wore so many petticoats that they could not sit without putting them on display . Bending over will display them if viewed from behind . Bop dancing will definitely display them and a bit more ! A windy day will do the trick . <p> I was up on a stepladder one day at high school , helping other girls put up decorations , when Mr. N****** walked in and came over to my ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't it ? And my thighs as well . And maybe my panties . I do n't know how naughty he was , but in the fifties nobody was arrested for such a thing . A screech and a giggle and a gathering of our petticoats was all it took . And we were not traumatized by it . We just told other girls what he did and we all have a good giggle fit . Life was better back then . <p> * * * * <p> Hollywood never seems to get the fifties right . Often they will dress all the girls bouffant . Other times they would all be dressed in pencil skirts . The truth is , it was simply a mixture of all different styles of dresses and skirts . <p> I believe the more prosperous a community was , the more you saw bouffant . If you saw a class picture of some poor West Virginia coal region you might not see a single bouffant girl . It 's not that petticoats were all that expensive , but rather they were considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was a different thing entirely . <p> When a little girl of the 50s was asked to a party if was not necessary to ask what she should wear . She put on a party dress and , without doubt , it was always bouffant . Those dresses , compared to what the older girls were wearing , were quite short . But we were little girls and if our panties occasionally showed it was all right . Some party dresses had a skirt that was so bouffant they had a tutu appearance , but this was not commonly worn . I kind of liked that style , myself but I did n't wear it as well . Mothers were still in charge after all . <p> I liked our shorter dresses back then but , as I grew older , I wanted to dress more like all the teenage girls I saw . But still I wanted a bouffant party dress , just not as short as I wore when I was eight or nine . I was fortunate to live in an affluent neighborhood , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all the more fun , with pretty dresses all around . Pinks , whites and yellows ; solid , paisley or polka dot . Robin 's egg blue or bold reds and all shades of green . And they were all puffed out with petticoats . It was heavenly ! <p> ED : We are glad Allison addressed two areas we thought have been neglected : The Hollywood treatment ; and the party dress situation . Jed Clampett ( Beverly Hillbillies ) oft times said to Elle Mae : " Go put on a nice party dress for our guests here . " We always looked forward to that ! Pertinent , but not the best , video * * * * <p> Skirt Flirting <p> What is skirt flirting , you may ask . This is something that I believe was automatic with some schoolgirls back in The Era . Again , not all girls were flirts ; just some . But this is about the ones that did . If a boy has noticed you , it is , most likely , because you 've been skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle , clever and sly . We girls had a dilemma back then . It was called our reputation . We wanted to show off a bit . We knew we had pretty legs and our petticoats were pretty , but with a future husband on our minds , we had to be careful not to appear easy ... or worse , look like a slut . We thought it would ruin our chances . It did n't , of course , but we all thought it would , so we were careful . <p> A few ways to skirt flirt without being obvious : <p> I liked gently rubbing my skirt and petticoat on my thighs . I think there were other girls that did the same , but not sure . It could be my original . Anyway , this was most effective if your petti was paper nylon and made that delightful sound . But the idea of a girl moving her petticoats up and down her thighs , even a little bit , always got the boys ' attention . <p> Lifting yourself up from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your bouffant skirt also grabbed the boys ' eyes . <p> When talking with other girls , grabbing a handful of your petticoats through your skirt and gently waving it about . Your petticoats will show if done right and the boys will watch you and not the other girls . <p> When talking to a boy seated across from you , play with the hem of your skirt . Lift it a bit and spread it out . This will appear to be a nervous habit to the boy , but it will be hard for him to hide the fact that he ca n't stop looking at your knees . <p> The ultimate skirt flirt is dangerous . You must do it in an innocent way and be prepared to react . You sit across from a boy you want to attract and ask him if he would help you with your shoe . You have already prepared your shoe by putting a good knot in the lace . So you ask him if he can get the knot out . He says yes and before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He now can see up your petticoats . You are n't sure how much he can see but the view will have a reaction for sure . Now it is important to act like you do n't realize he can see up your skirt . After a few long seconds you react . A shriek followed by the pushing together of your petticoats , followed by a giggle . You have done it and your reputation is intact . You will stay on his mind <p> E <p> D : We remember the ' inadvertent ' way a girl would drape her skirt/pettis slightly across you lap when she sat next to you , say , in a car or on a couch . Wow ! Accidentally . Right . &lt;whew&gt; Just the memory . <p> * * * * <p> End of The Era <p> By the beginning of the 1960s things were starting to change , and fashion was one . The petticoat had run its course and was now being identified with the 1950s . Petticoats were still worn by schoolgirls in 1960 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fashion industry was looking for something new and our new first lady was leading the change . The tailored look was taking over . <p> But what about us schoolgirls ? Some girls refused to let go of bouffant . I was one of them . I loved the look and I did n't take the change well at all . The one thing about the change I did like was hem lines . They had risen to just below the knee , a length that I thought was perfection . But it was not long before they started to rise again . <p> So what replaced bouffant for the teenage girl ? Dull and boring did . Even pencil skirts were gone . The boys that were pencil skirt fans were disappointed by its demise but .. and I do believe this ... they were not as disappointed as the boys who were bouffant fans . Both were left with nothing to look at but dull straight skirts with little flair or style . This was the common look for girls from 1962 through 1965 . In ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what happened then . But I was still young , so I embraced the mini skirt . At least they had some style and flair . <p> So what became of bouffant ? It never completely left us . Party dresses , especially for young girls , still included bouffant . Dance dresses still included bouffant . Cocktail dresses still included bouffant . As a matter of fact , I remember my mother wearing bouffant dresses to cocktail parties even into the 1970s . <p> Let 's see .. It was a song called " Summer Nights " , in the movie , Grease.For those of you who have n't seen it , it was sung by two separate groups . One group of high school boys and the other , a group of girls . In the song the John Travolta part was bragging about the girl he met that summer , the Bouffant Girl named Sandy . The girl group was doing the same , as Sandy told about the boy she met . There are two lines in the song that always made me smile because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me more , tell me more , like does he have a car ? " And the boys were saying , " Tell me more , tell me more , did you get very far ? " That about summed up car dating in The Era . But there were more fun details as well . <p> Sports cars <p> I think this just may be a limited experience . It 's because where I lived more boys had better cars then in other parts of my city and other places . What I 'm saying is , there were more boys with sports cars where I lived . Some of those cars were very small as well . Well there was this one date I remember . I was surprised to see the little foreign car he came to pick me up in . I still ca n't tell you what it was , but when I got in and sat down in that little seat my bouffant skirt was all over the place . That boy , after opening the door for me , ( remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hesitated when he saw his gear shift hidden under my skirt . I knew it was covered , but I made no attempt to pull my petticoats in . My skirt looked so good flared out like that . Anyway , I wanted to see what he would do about it . <p> He looked in pain for a bit as he stared at my skirt . Then he made his decision . He told me my skirt was covering his gear shift and could I move it . So I did , but I was disappointed . He was a gentleman , I thought , but a coward as well . No , we did n't always like gentlemanly behavior . We were more sexual then that . Why did n't he move my petticoats himself ? <p> Now , as a contrast , I will continue . It was about a month or so later when I had my second sports car date . This kid had a Corvette ! ! I love Corvettes ! Needless to say , this teenage girl was impressed . Ten points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It covered his gear shift as well . But this time would be different . He started his car and , without hesitation , he grabbed the knob of his gear shift right through my skirt and petticoats . He never missed a gear ! It was so strangely tantalizing ! Finally , I asked him if he wanted me to pull in my skirt . He said no . He knew where the gears were . <p> He just made another ten points with me ! <p> * * * * <p> More car dating <p> Sports cars were a treat , but most times it was a sedan . Some of you will remember bench seats . You never find this anymore and I sometimes wonder why . Never mind . Bench seats were both wonderful and threatening on a car date . We could get close to our date if we wanted to and he could get close to us if he was parked and wanted to . But they always wanted to ! And it was all too easy with a bench seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as to the merits of the bench seat . <p> Out of gas <p> You know , I 've never experienced this . No date I ever had parked his car and announced he was out of gas . I sometimes wonder if it was an invention of Hollywood . But if it did happen , it would mean only two things to us girls : " I 'm out of gas , let 's make out ; " or , " I 'm out of gas , Sorry . We 'll have to walk back . " The second boy is an idiot and you never go out with him again . First boy : ... well , it depends on how we feel about him . <p> Drive-in movies <p> We had one of these only a mile and a half from were I lived , so you know , " Mr. bench seat " , wanted to go there often . Needless to say , it could be a tense situation or an exciting one . So most girls , back then , knew what movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing . This is because some boys would ask you out to a movie . If you asked what 's playing , you had better know if it was in the drive-in or the brick and mortar building before you said yes . It made life easier , and may have kept an unwanted hand from exploring under your petticoats . All in all , I still liked drive-ins ... and warm wanted hands . <p> * * * * <p> And more car dating <p> We were very superficial creatures ; teenage girls . So what was important to us ? Our hair , our outfits , our shoes ? They were all important ! But when it came to car dating , it was our image we fretted over . No girl of the Era wanted to date a guy that drove an unacceptable vehicle . A cute guy with an unacceptable vehicle was a vexing problem for the girl that dated him . She really did n't want to be seen riding in that Studebaker or that Hudson . And if he had a Nash , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl friend , back then , was dating a boy who luckily drove an acceptable car . It was a white Ford convertible with red interior . I ca n't remember the model , but it was a pretty car . My friend 's name was Sharon and she was , like me , a bouffant girl . She told me that she once , or more then once , dressed to match the car . She bought a plain white circle skirt with a red blouse . Under her skirt she wore bright red petticoats and at least three of them . She must have been quite a sight , sitting in that Ford . I wonder what her boy friend thought about it ? She was his doll with the classy chassis in his cool Ford chariot . <p> I was lucky . I remember being seen in a Thunderbird and a Corvette . Those were my favorite cars . But I never dressed to match those cars like Sharon did . I wanted to stand out , not blend in . And I made sure that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior . Do n't laugh . It was important to a superficial doll of The Era . <p> * * * * <p> Petticoats , panties and ... <p> There were a great many sexually naive high school girls in the nineteen fifties . These girls lived in their own world with friends that were like themselves . But then there were the more naughty girls . Naughty like me . There was a slang saying among naughty girls back then : " He 's a three ' P ' man . He 'll give you the scramble egg treatment . " But here I will only talk about two ' P ' . On second thought , a bit of three ' P ' . <p> It was around 1969 , and I was working in a law office in New Haven . I was having lunch in a downtown luncheonette when I ran into a guy that I knew in the sixth , seventh and eighth grades . I remembered him because he was so funny looking back then and still was . Okay , not nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , in a mini skirt , he could not help but talk about my transformation . He told me about something that happened in the eighth grade . I was surprised that he remembered and that I had forgotten about it , but soon I knew the reason why . <p> We were all ( the whole class ) walking down the street , and I ca n't remember where we were going , but I do remember a bit of horse play . This guy , whom I have just re-united with in that luncheonette , was the one that was picking on me and teasing me . I was mad and I was kind of in his face and I was walking backwards when I tripped and fell on some uneven pavement . I blacked out for a moment when my head hit the pavement . When I came to , Patty was helping me up . I had noticed that the boys had become very quiet , but I thought they were just concerned and I thought nothing of it . Besides , my head hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the reason why they were so quiet . It seemed I was knocked out a bit longer then I thought . When I fell , my petticoats flew back and they made a circle with my skirt and petticoats over my face . I was fully exposed with my panties in the middle of the circle . He said the boys were all around me and stared until Patty pushed her way in and pulled my petticoats down . He told me I was wearing pink nylon panties and the boys could see my bush through the thin material . Well I was flabbergasted ! I never knew this ! No wonder he remembered that incident ! &lt;Giggles&gt; <p> * * * * <p> The French Connection ( Part One ) <p> No , not that old movie . I 'm talking style here . In The Era , Paris was THE place ! We knew our petticoats , pencil skirts and party dresses , and just about everything we adored was a product of a French designer . Whether it was true or not , we believed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elegance , romance , and that naughty but nice dance called the cancan . For the teenage girl , who loved her clothes , Paris was like a dream . <p> It was morning and a gaggle of us teenage schoolgirls were gathered under the arch as we always did shortly before the start of the school day . <p> Colletta ( I hope I 'm spelling her name correctly ) was a genuine French girl . Back when she first came to our school , she had been in this country for only five years , I think that 's right . Colletta spoke good English and fluent French . I was taking French in school , as were some of the other girls , so we were lucky to have Colletta in our group . <p> On one particular morning , Colletta wanted to show us something , but she did n't want to show it in so public a place , so we all left the Arch and went to the back of the school building by the parking lot . Colletta , who always carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Era ) reached inside and pulled out the prettiest pair of panties we 'd ever seen ! We all gasped ! It was what is know as ' flutter style ' . It was small compared to American-style panties . The top part was satin pink with tiny bows about , and the short flutter leg openings were all white lace and very high-cut . It was true Parisian haute couture . Colletta said it was from the House of Dior . We were all so impressed ! ! ! ! Colletta said her family had many fashions sent here directly from France . We were impressed again , and jealous . I spoke up and asked if she could get some of those panties for us . I wanted a few pair so badly ! However , not all the girls wanted to wear that style because it was very sexual , and if they thought it was okay their mothers might have a different idea . But , still , I wanted a pair so badly that I did n't leave her alone . I had money saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would wear them under my party and dance dresses , but I could n't wait . I wore a pair to school the very next day . I will tell you about my experience next time I write . <p> * * * * <p> The French Connection ( Part Two ) <p> I was excited ! How many teenage girls of the era get to wear Parisian haute couture ? ! Sure , nobody will see my panties , but just knowing I was wearing such glorious lingerie was a joy . Oh yes ! I will be showing them at the next dance . In those days I could twirl my petticoats pretty high ; especially close to the right boys . <p> What to wear ? I would love to put on my peach party dress , but I 'm going to school , so that was out of the question . It seemed nothing that I would wear to school really measured up . I think I should re-think this . That 's enough , I 'm wearing them ! I chose my lacy white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse was white as well . I waited till the last to slip my French panties up and under my petticoats . It was a very sensual feeling , and I looked at myself in the mirror as I held my petticoats high . How delicious they looked ! The silky top was a pale green and the ruching lace was pure white . The first thing I noticed was how comfortable and different they felt . They were tighter , but softer in a certain place and so delicate in another . The second thing I noticed was that the flutter lace made me feel more exposed than my traditional panties . A feeling I must adjust to . So ... OFF TO SCHOOL ! <p> It was silly but I felt like shouting , " Hey , you want to see my panties ? ! " But it was a feeling , not an utterance . So I want to express to you how they feel , but I think that only another girl will understand . But I will try . I believe that after a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the realization that these panties were designed to be sensual as well as sexy-looking . The feeling that I got from the way the silky material moved across my sensitive lips is too naughty to describe . I realized it must have been designed that way , and I found myself moving about my seat and hoping nobody would notice . I liked it ! ! ! ! ! Ca n't wait for the next party , or the next dance . <p> * * * * <p> A short autobiography relating to clothing and petticoats <p> Growing up in the 1950s was an experience I 'll always treasure . It was truly the feminine era . It may have been a man 's world , but we girls were the starring attraction . Pretty dresses , pretty petticoats , it was a magical time for me . Most girls loved pretty clothes in those days , but I think I was extreme . In school I was very protective of my dresses . I would always sit on the school steps during recess . I would take paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steps . Then I would scoop my dress and petticoat and sit on them so the steps would n't get my dress dirty . Is that extreme , or what ? ! I was a petite girl . I 'm still petite . If I were to describe myself , I guess I would be that little Irish girl next door . I have an older sister , Susan . Susan is five years my senior , and built tall and slim , so I never got any hand-me-downs . That was a good thing , for all my clothes were new ! I was so lucky that I grew up in an affluent neighborhood . My mom loved to buy me pretty clothes , because she loved my enthusiasm for fashion . Girls back then could sense a kind of power that we had over the boys , especially when we wore our petticoats . As we got older we understood that the power was our own femininity . The tease of a girl 's pretty legs disappearing under clouds of crinoline and lace could reduce certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that boys loved and tried to peek up our skirts , and this was okay with girls that understood why , and did n't take offense ... and that was more girls then you realized back then , I 'm sure . By the middle sixties , the petticoats had disappeared from the stores . I think the fashion world was just desirous of change . As a teenage , I went along with the mini skirts . I liked mini skirts , all right , but there was always something missing . I missed the femininity of the lace . I missed the bouffant look and feel of my crinoline . I missed that delicious tease that made the boys go wild . When the seventies came alone ... well , I do n't even want to talk about it . UGH ! But there was hope in the eighties . By the middle eighties , pretty dresses for the young had made a come back . Some of them even had simple crinolines . I purchased a lot of dresses back then and I still have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'm much too old for that , but I do n't have the desire to get rid of them . So I keep them , and maybe my nieces will like them and wear them again for boys to enjoy . <p> You will see some pretty dresses on some of my picture CDs , in addition to some retro dresses and skirts from the fifties and early sixties . But most important are the petticoats from Tessy 's collection . I get a thrill knowing that you will be enjoying my pretty dresses and skirts and the beautiful petticoats from Tessy 's vast collection . You will even get many naughty peeks up my skirt . Many ! <p> " Reading Allison 's latest story about Car Dating brings to mind two memories of my own : <p> " In the mid 80s I started dating a sweet gal who was quite a bit younger than I and within the first couple of months told her about being a crossdresser . She was pretty much okay with it so far , as she did n't immediately go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into going to a movie at one of the few drive in 's that remained open at the time . AND , got her to wear one of my full skirts with a very full petticoat under it . What a thrill it was in the mid 1980s to go on a date to the movies with a girl in a 50s style skirt with petticoats ! I vaguely recall that the movie was one of those Kung-Fu types , which we really did n't watch , nor did we care what was playing . : - ) <p> " Another time was a few years later with another girlfriend , who actually met me when I was dressed as a girl , and was more my age . We would often both dress up in outfits with petticoats in the evenings . I got a chuckle out of a response one time when I asked , ' How in the world did you girls ever go to the bathroom in the 50s with all those petticoats on ? ' She said , " We just swished ' em up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I never did quite master that ! <p> " Ahhhh , the memories ! Thanks , Allison and everyone else ! " <p> The diaphanous dress <p> So , .. how many of you are hitting Dictionary.com ? I 'm sure a lot of you know what ' diaphanous ' means but for those of you who do n't , I will save you the time ... Diaphanous : " Very sheer and light ; almost completely transparent or translucent . " Better known as a see-through dress . <p> If a dress is so see-through that light shines through it , revealing the girl beneath , it 's diaphanous . Also known as " sheer , " " transparent , " or just plain " sexy , " but the word diaphanous is so much classier . <p> I say sexy , because on a lady wearing a diaphanous cocktail dress with the right undergarments , her transparent dress was a very sexy sight . But what about little girls ? More diaphanous dresses were made for little girls back in the Era than any other female group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A diaphanous dress requires the girl wear a full length chemise underneath her dress . The dress color tints the chemise but the chemise is the star of the show . All the diaphanous dresses I 've seen were full skirted which were cut to contain a petticoat with an attached chemise bodice . These were pretty undergarments and were meant to be a part of your dress . However , because they were part dress , part underwear , the diaphanous dress became a controversial garment for young girls . Some mothers thought they were pretty and a young girl is innocent enough to wear them . Others thought they were too provocative for a young girl to wear . Me ? I just liked them . <p> I ca n't remember the girl 's name so I 'll just call her Mary . She was in the seventh grade at the time and the poor girl was dumb as a stump . Well the story I was told was this : <p> It was her 12th birthday party , and for her birthday , her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted her to try it on so Mary went into her bedroom to change . Her mother knew she had several chemises she could wear , but when Mary re-appeared her mother was in shock ! Her dress fit perfectly and she looked sweet in her new dress , but she wore nothing underneath ! She was a big hit with the party goers , especially the boys , as she was naked under her dress . Well she did have her panties on . Her mother quickly took her into her bedroom and explained the dress to her . Poor dumb Mary was so embarrassed ! <p> Baby Sitting <p> For a great many girls of The Era , baby sitting , or as we called it , ' watching the rug rats ' , was a common way for a high school girl to make a little money . I was one of those girls , and I got my entire record collection thanks to baby sitting . I 've always liked children , so it was an easy occupation for me . That is , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the shows in New Haven , the house parties , the cocktail parties and what-not , there was plenty of work to go around . The other nice thing is , the affluent always give great tips ! <p> I had my favorite kids who I sat for , and some that were just okay , but there was this one boy who I have never forgotten . His name was Jack , and he was unbelievable . <p> I did not know his family . The woman on the phone told me I was highly recommended . They lived at the top of the hill in a beautiful teal blue house . I was greeted at the door by a man dressed in a dark charcoal gray suit , cut so well it must have been Italian . He was a pleasant , well-mannered , gentleman . His wife made her appearance wearing a beautiful , strapless , cocktail dress of champagne pink and black . It was very bouffant , and I complimented her on it . She tersely thanked me . The man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old boy was sitting . " This is my son , Jack , " he instructed . " Make him happy this evening and there will be an extra twenty dollars for you . " <p> I could n't believe my ears ! Twenty dollars back then was a lot of money ! I could buy that party dress I saw , and with enough left over for a couple of petticoats ! ! ! This was going to be easy ! Whatever this kid wants to do , we will do it ! <p> I got the usual instructions , and out the door they went . Jack stayed quiet until he heard his parents car leave . Well , this is " confessions of a bouffant girl " so here we go . <p> Now , I must paraphrase because it 's way too long ago to remember exact words , so I will just give you the gist of it : <p> " So , Jack , what would you like to do ? " <p> He smiled and came over and sat down next to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me how many petticoats I was wearing . I told him two . Then he asked me if he could see them . I was surprised by his forwardness but , remembering the twenty dollars , I thought there was no harm in it . I pulled my skirt back and showed him my pretty petticoats . He glared at them , then he asked me , " What color panties are you wearing ? " Wait a minute ! Did he say this kid was thirteen ! ? ! ? <p> " Make him happy and there will be an extra twenty dollars for you " <p> Well , I thought , what the heck ; it 's just a color . " White , " I told him . <p> " Are they nylon ? " <p> " Rayon . " <p> " Can I see them ? " <p> " NO ! " I told him . <p> " Come on , Allie ! I want a look . " <p> " NO ! You little brat ! " <p> He got mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crinolines fly out the window . What to do ? It was driving me crazy . Then my greed got the best of meand I got up from the couch and stepped up on the coffee table . <p> " Well , go ahead . " I told him . " Have a look . " <p> He smiled broadly and quickly looked up my petticoats , pulling them out for a better view . I kept thinking , party dress , party dress , party dress as he stared up my petticoats . Then I felt his hands on my thighs moving up to my panties . I screamed and jumped off that table . <p> " That 's enough ! " I shouted . <p> " I just wanted a feel ... " <p> " No ! No feel ! " <p> " Come on , Allie ! Let me feel them . " <p> I sat back down on the couch and , before another word was said , little Jack 's hands were up my petticoats . I pushed him away . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said . " You do that again and I 'm calling your parents and telling them what you 've been doing . " <p> He began to pout , but I did n't care anymore . No twenty bucks , no party dress and no new petticoats . I was resigned . I put on his television and found something he liked . He stayed , watching all evening until his parents came home . <p> When his father asked him if he had a good time , he enthusiastically said , " Yes , Dad ! " <p> I got my twenty bucks . <p> Amusement park memories <p> The summer that I remember , was a hot one . In two short months , Janet and I would be back in high school , but we were in no hurry ; it was summer and time to have fun . <p> Rye Beach Amusement Park , back then , was a short train ride away but I never went until that summer when my mom treated me and my friend , Janet , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NYC . The bouffant style was soon coming to an end , but I refused to let it go . As you know , I loved the look . So it is , without a doubt , that I was wearing a bouffant skirt that day . There , in my opinion , is nothing more comfortable on a hot day then a nice full cotton skirt , and with some layering of tulle underneath . It was like natural air conditioning . Your legs feel almost naked . Janet wore that pretty summer sundress that I loved . I was always jealous of that dress . Her dress was white with small polka dots . So how could I remember that detail from so long ago ? Janet had a Brownie camera and still has some pictures in her scrap book . The dress had an elasticized camisole top with a full circle skirt . Janet wore a petticoat of sheer rayon netting with two layers of crinoline netting underneath . I thought it was too fancy for the park , but Janet wanted to wear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home early so we could have a full day at the park . Mom drove us down to the train station and read us the riot act . We knew that if we wanted to do this again then we had better not mess up . We both wore watches so we would n't miss our train back . After a short ride on the train , we got on a bus that shuttled from the train station right up to the amusement parks main gate . It was easy ! We were through the gate by 9:30 in the morning . We did n't  eat much breakfast that morning because we knew we would be tempted by all the cotton candy , corn dogs , popcorn , hotdogs , pretzels , and lots of other great junk foods . Janet and I could eat lots of junk , back then , and never gain weight . I wish I was still like that . <p> Because we were early , the park was n't too crowded . We walked around for a while just to see where all the rides were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were getting a lot of attention from the boys that worked there and we loved it . Back then , if a girl looked pretty , the boys would always let her know it . We loved that ! The boys would whistle at us and make silly wolf noises . If you are old enough to remember , and you were one of those boys back then that whistled at the pretty girls : thank you ! We lived for it ! Whatever happened to that ? Fear of the PC police , I guess . Its so sad . <p> " Its coming to a stop . I want to get on line before the line gets too long ! " <p> " All right , I 'm coming . " <p> We still had to wait a bit , but we were in front of the line , so Janet was happy . When the ride reopened we got in the first car . Janet thought we were lucky , but I do n't  like the first car . If you 've ever rode the first car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar down across us and I grabbed onto it for dear life . The long slow noisy ride to the top of the first peak was the part that made me the most nervous . We were so high and you had time to think about what was coming . Janet was excited and could n't wait but I just wanted to get it over with . <p> As we went over the top I could n't see anything under us , then the sudden fall , and my stomach felt like I shouldnt have eaten that hot dog . Our skirts and crinolines were flying back in our faces . I held on to the bar with a death grip . When we bottomed out it felt like an elephant was sitting on my head . Up we went again , then we were thrown to the side as we went around a curve , then plunging down again , then up to the right , then back to the left , then down and back up and , on and on we went . By this time it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , suddenly , we leveled out , and the cars slowed . There were people standing in line on the platform watching us coming in . My skirt and crinolines were blown back , exposing my legs for all the boys to see . I wouldve pushed my skirt back down , if I had n't  still had a death grip on that bar . Janet let go of the bar near the end of the ride and she arrived at the station looking like a lady . <p> After the cars stopped I finally let go of the bar and got my skirt back under control . The attendant pulled the bar back up and we left the car with wobbly legs . I did n't  feel so good , so we sat down for awhile until I regained my ladylike composure . <p> " Wasnt that fun ? Why do n't  we do it again ! " <p> " No ! Once is enough for me ! " <p> " Okay , what do you want to do next ? " <p> " Let 's just walk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pavilion and listen to the band for awhile . I 'll bet there 's a lot of boys over there . " <p> Well that sounded like a lot more fun than that torture machine called The Cyclone . <p> The old pavilion must have been built at the turn of the century . It was a very large building painted a dark green , and there was a wide porch that ran all the way around it . Inside was a large dance floor and bandstand . I was told that during the late thirties , and all through the forties , some famous big bands had played there . As we approached , we could hear a rock and roll band playing . <p> " Allie , let 's get a Coke . " <p> The line at the concession stand was short , so we hurried over and got on it . We were just in time . A large group of teenagers from the pavilion hurried over and got on line behind us . One really cute boy smiled at us and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im Allison and this is my friend , Janet . " <p> " Im Pete . You dolls here to dance ? Its a really cool band . " <p> " We might . " <p> " Hey , I know the guys in the band . Theyre good friends of mine . You want to meet them later ? " <p> " I do n't  know . " Janet sure had a way with words . I spoke up . <p> " We just got off The Cyclone . We want to rest for awhile and listen to the band . " <p> " I guess The Cyclone was too much for ya ! " He and his friends were laughing . Janet looked peeved . <p> " Allison did n't  like it , but I thought it was fun ! " <p> " Hey , I was teasing , okay ? Hey , did you girls try The Rotor ? " <p> " No what is it ? " <p> " Its a really cool ride . Even Allison will like it . " <p> I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " <p> Before Pete could answer , we were up to the window . <p> " Can I help you ? " <p> " Two Cokes , please . " <p> We took our drinks and headed for the pavilion . As we walked away , Pete shouted , " Maybe I 'll see ya later . Hey , try The Rotor . Its fun ! " <p> I enjoyed the rest and listening to the band , but I could tell that Janet was getting restless , so I thought wed better have some fun . <p> " What do ya want to do , Janet ? " <p> " The rotor . I want to try The Rotor . " <p> " Its not going to make me dizzy , is it ? " <p> " You heard Pete . Its a cool ride ! Come on , let 's go . " <p> We walked around , looking for The Rotor ride . <p> " Its over there , Allison ! I see it ! " <p> We saw a large building that was shaped like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of it and a large flat front where the line was forming . It looked like we would be entering at the bottom so I wondered what the stairway was for . When we got closer , I could see what looked like seats with a railing going completely around the top . I saw people up there looking over the railing down into that cylinder thing . <p> " The line 's moving , Allison ! I do n't  think it will take long ! " Janet was excited . <p> As we waited on line , I looked at all the pictures painted on the front of the rotor ride building . It was pictures of people supposedly riding inside the rotor . The people seemed like they were in distress ! They looked like they were falling ! I was getting nervous . Just then I heard girls screaming inside . <p> " Janet , I do n't  like this thing . Let 's go . " <p> " You do n't  even know what it is . Pete said it was cool . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I was very nervous . Soon we were entering through a door at the bottom . I saw that we were inside a big cylinder that had no top . In the center was a column with a hand railing around it . We were instructed to hold onto the railing . Then the floor started to rise like an elevator and as we got closer to the top I could see the railing and all the people up there in sort of a gallery looking down at us like we were on exhibition . The floor stopped rising about eight feet from the top . <p> " Hey look , Allison ! Its Pete ! " <p> I looked where Janet was pointing and saw Pete . He was up in the gallery and he had a big grin on his face . I could n't help but think that he had been up there waiting for us . He looked like he was going to enjoy watching what was about to happen to us . I was really nervous . Just then , we were instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padded with a rubbery like material . Janet and I stood with our backs against the wall and when everyone was in place the rotor started to spin . <p> " I 'm getting dizzy , Janet ! " <p> " Do n't  be a baby . This is fun ! " <p> The rotor spun faster and faster and we became pinned to the wall . I could n't move ! My skirt and crinoline were pressed tightly against the wall and across my legs . <p> " I do n't  like this ! " I cried out loud . <p> Then the floor dropped away ! It dropped ten feet or more ! Janet and I both started screaming ! But we did n't  fall ! We were pinned to the wall and could n't move ! <p> The rotor continued to spin at a fast pace , then it started to slow . It was slowing just a little bit at a time . Gravity started to take over and I felt myself starting to slip down the wall . I could see the girls on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their skirts were not ! I looked down at my own skirt and saw that my skirt and crinoline was still pressed tightly against the wall ! Gravity was pulling me down out of my clothes ! I tried to push my skirt down but it was impossible ! I could see the girls on the other side of the cylinder . Their legs were being exposed more and more as they slipped down the wall . I saw a lady struggling to push her skirt down as her stocking tops and garters came into view . All the girls that were in skirts were screaming ! My crinoline was bunching up around me . I tried and tried to push my skirt down but I could n't . I heard Janet screaming , <p> " Allison , my dress ! " I looked at Janet and her dress and her lovely crinoline was almost up around her waist . <p> " I cant get my dress down ! What do I do ? " All I could think was I hope she wore pretty panties . <p> " Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! " <p> As the rotor slowed even more , we continued to slip down toward the floor . Our thighs were now completely exposed and we knew our panties would soon be next . I tried to raise my legs up and turn on my side but it did n't  work . I looked over at Janet and her crinoline was over her head . Janet was completely exposed . She tried to cover her panties with her hands . We knew that Pete was up there enjoying every second of our plight , and it made us so mad ! My blouse was pulled out of my skirt and my bra was exposed . My crinoline was up over my head and I knew my panties were exposed . I had no choice but to do what Janet was doing . I tried to cover my panties with my hands . We could hear the men in the upper gallery cheering . When we finally reached the floor , I fell over . I was pushing my skirt and crinoline down and tried to get my blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy , Janet ! I 'm going to kill that Pete ! " <p> We were quite wobbly and extremely embarrassed as we stumbled out the door . All we wanted to do was find a place to sit and recuperate . After that experience , we decided that if we ever got our composure back , we would go back to the pavilion . We thought that men had designed that ride for one purpose only , to get the girls ' skirts up , but looking back , I have to admit it was fun . <p> We felt better after a brief rest , so we went back to the pavilion and had fun dancing with the boys for the rest of the afternoon . We never ran into Pete again . I think he was avoiding us . I wonder why ? <p> It was getting late , and we had to leave and catch our train . It was a fun and exciting time , and these memories of my crinoline days will always stay strong in my mind . <p> ... and a link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also adds this enlargeable photo : <p> Allison sends this picture of the Coney Island Rotor , similar to the one described above <p> " A bouffant girl trying to hold her skirt down . No date , but the hair and skirt looks like ' 59 to ' 62 " <p> ... and this one of a girl trying to turn so she can get control of her skirt . " Not bouffant , but funny anyway .

Those ubiquitous school pictures from grade school through high school . I never liked having my picture taken .

When it came to photographing young girls , he was lascivious . My sister complained to Mother about him , but my mother got mad at my sister for saying those things about him . How dare she criticize this great artist ! Okay , so it looks like I was on my own . Well , he lived up to his reputation . Both of them . Great pictures and fast hands . <p> A friend of mine told me about the photographer that took her grade school graduation picture .

He would scoop the girl 's skirt with both hands and flare the petticoats out so the girl 's dress looked its best as she sat down . Nothing wrong with that , is there ? AH , but every time he did this he gave the girl 's bottom a feel . The girls either gave him a dirty look or they giggled . There were more giggles then looks . <p> There was no arrest and no lawsuit . The six o'clock news did no cover it . All there was was a giggle and a memory . Life was good back then . <p> Full skirts and the wind <p> Schoolgirls of The Era all seem to have these kinds of stories .

" Karen inquires . <p> " Yes , and there were lots of men around that building and they were all watching me ! " <p> So was Peggy warning Karen about the Fulton building ? I mean , was she really warning Karen ? Peggy told Karen and other girls her skirt- blowing story for one reason only . It was a naughty thrill . <p> I had a couple of skirt blowing stories myself .

They were a girl 's security on a date .

While I was talking with Miss Ness You turned our home into a mess . You shaved the cat , released the dog , Uncaged the bird , brought in a frog . You made a fort out of my books And scattered toys in ev'ry nook . And all the dishes in the sink You broken each of them , I think . And all your Sister 's dolls you harmed For there 's a head and there 's an arm . When I approached , you ran and hid . You know I do n't like what you did . For ev'ry crime you must confess . To pay the debt you 'll wear a dress . One day for each thing that you did , One day for each thing I 've forbid . And since you performed all of them , You 'll wear green frocks with lacy hems . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose the dog or shave the cat . I did n't make your books a mouse For Squeaky , my kid Sister 's mouse , Who living now inside the cat . She ate him up . Imagine that ! The bird 's inside the cat as well . How it got loose , I can not tell . That 's not a frog , but it 's a toad That Sarah Jane found upon the road . I never touched a single cup . It 's Sarah Jane who broke them up . I did not do the things so bad . But it 's Sarah Jane , my Sis , who had . <p> You can not blame sweet Sarah Jane . The reason must be very plain : While I was with Miss Ness , you see , Sarah Jane served us both some tea . She was with me when this occurred . I know you 've lied with ev'ry word . For lying , that 's another day And ev'ry debt you will repay . For blaming Sarah for this mess A month more you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid You will be Sarah Jane 's own maid . And since you performed all of them , You 'll wear green frocks with lacy hems . <p> Maybe those things I will confess , But I will never wear a dress . I ca n't wear dresses , do n't you see ? The boys will all make fun of me . I will not be my Sister 's maid , Not even if I should get paid . Having a Sis is bad enough , To wear a dress would make life rough . To cater to her ev'ry whim . I 'm not a Girl , I am a him . So spank me if you think you should Or ground me . That might do some good . I wo n't wear frocks with lacey hems ; I wo n't go anywhere near to them . <p> A spanking you will soon forget And grounding you has not worked yet . I 'll burn your trousers if I must . You 'll watch while I turn them to dust . I 'll sell your shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys . For you will learn how to behave And that means being Sarah 's slave . For Sarah 's kind and meek and mild And unlike you she 's never wild . And if the boys make fun of you , Well , maybe that 's the thing to do . Since you fear loud laughs from them , You 'll wear green frocks with lacy hems . <p> Oh Mommy , please , I will be good . I 'll do the things you think I should . I 'll feed the pets and buy a mouse . I 'll dust our books and clean the house . I 'll wash the dishes ev'ry day And only in my room I 'll play . I 'll mend all of my Sister 's dolls . Whate'er you ask , I 'll do it all . But please do n't make me wear a dress Let me be boyish , more or less . Do n't make me be my Sister 's slave . Please , not a maid , I will behave . The household chores I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boys like you I humiliate . All boys are bad , but Girls are great . By now , Sarah Jane has hidden your stuff : Your pants and shirts , but that 's enough To start my sissifying plan : You 'll be more Girl and less a man . You 'll do ev'rything that we might say You 'll do the chores on ev'ry day . You 'll be your Sister 's servile maid Without a chance that you 'll be paid . So you wo n't do them in the nude ( For naked boys I think are crude ) , You 'll wear them when you work and play . <p> I bought these dresses yesterday . I knew you 'd do things very bad . The living room 's proof that you had . I 'm sure they 'll fit you perfectly , Just like your pants and shirts . You 'll see And you will wear each one of them : Frilly green frocks with lacey hems . Take off your clothes , put on this dress So you can start to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself Or Sarah Jane will gladly help . I 'll hold you while she tears them off She shred to rags all of your stuff .

They 'll harm you more than I can say . You 'll get beaten by all of them For wearing frocks with lacy hems . <p> If now I change into a dress To do the chores , clean up this mess , To be a maid to Sarah Jane , To do all that and not complain , How can you keep it from my friends Until my servitude will end ? How long must my secret be hid The time to pay for what I did ? Can you keep it from all of them That I wear frocks with lacy hems ? <p> You 'll stay in dresses as a slave Until you learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be Gentle and kind . Act properly And soon you 'll wear your pants again If from boyishness you refrain . You have three bosses now , you see : Dad , Sister Sarah Jane , and me . Please all of us and we wo n't tell And make your life a living hell .

@@37517600 @6517600/ <p> N.B. Please keep in mind that everything I describe here is true in every detail . This is not fiction , and happened when I was at school in Sussex in the 1950s . <p> Those of us who so love to be little girls can usually remember clearly when we first recognised our inner , longed-for self . I certainly do . <p> For me , it was back in 1951 , when I was about 10 years old . I 'd gone round to play at my friend Billys house , and when it was time for me to go home , it was pouring with rain . Billys Mum , like any responsible mother , wanted to make sure that I did n't  get soaking wet , so she took down his sisters white translucent plastic mac from the back of the door and said that I must wear it home . At this moment of self discovery I gave a gulp of inner pleasure at the prospect , and willingly slid my arms into the sleeves while she pulled it on over my shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tied the belt around my waist with a neat bow at the front . Then she put up the hood , which was of the typical girls raincoat pattern in the 1950s , with a square cut top at the back of the head . As she tied the tie tapes in a bow under my chin , something went click inside me and I just felt wonderful . At that moment I so envied Billys sister June being dressed in her mackintosh by her mum like that . I said goodbye , and set off through the dark wet streets , and I felt so good walking home in the rain as it beat down on my mac and hood When I got home , my mum did n't  think anything of it , and I so hated having to return it a couple of days later ! <p> Well , I know that 's what started it , and by the time I was a year or so older , I had acquired a girls plastic mac of my own . By now my inner little girl self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete girls primary school uniform , befitting my age . Money was of course very short with my level of pocket money , but I was able to buy what I needed at the railway lost property office for next to nothing . My outfit consisted of a green check gingham primary school dress , white ankle socks , a pair of my own brown T bar sandals which at that time were worn by both boys and girls , and a headscarf to hide my short hair . <p> And so began my first excursions into the outside world dressed as a girl . I used to creep out of the back door of our house on winter evenings when it got dark early , and I would go for a walk through the streets wearing my gingham dress , on top of which I wore my hooded plastic mac , which meant that you could also see my dress underneath . Aged ten or eleven , I had no trouble passing myself off as a girl , as I had a naturally feminine appearance , and I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict these activities to when I was home on holidays when I was sent to an all boys boarding school in 1952 . <p> But there were to be some compensations that I 'd never dreamed of , such as school plays for instance . What an opportunity that was . Being an all boys school , it meant that all the female parts were played by the younger boys , myself included . I was n't a bad little actor , so you can imagine how delighted I was to land the part of Lucy the maid in Sheridans The Rivals , a comedy written in 1775 . <p> In a boys school of the 1950s , about the only women around were the school matron , who was in charge of sick bay , and the headmasters wife . Our costumes for this play were of the period of the 1770s , so you can imagine how enjoyable that was . Under my green and white striped dress I had to wear small artificial bust pads . They were small because I was meant to be a young maid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and at the hips , as this was the fashion at the time . A calico petticoat went on top of the pads and under my dress . That dress was lovely . It had three quarter length sleeves with lace at the cuffs and around the collar . It fastened down the back , and matron had to lace me into it for each performance . She also had to release me afterwards ! At the age of 12 I had a very narrow waist , about 18 inches I think , so with the hip padding as well , I had something approaching an hourglass figure . For the first scene , where I 'd just returned from a library errand for my mistress , I wore a dark green cloak with a large hood , again in the style of the time . We were of course made up , and I well remember the thrill of being tutored by matron to walk and talk like a girl . I also had to learn to curtsy properly in the fashion of the 1700s . If Matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back now , its funny really , because the other boys used to sympathise with me at having to dress as a girl . If theyd only known ! It still makes me smile . <p> Unfortunately we were only given the girls parts when we were younger , so this idyllic situation did n't  last for more than a couple of years , but one other nice experience I remember was when I took the part of Vicky , a ten year old little girl in a play called The Monkeys Paw , a short supernatural thriller . That I really enjoyed . To save money , and because the play was contemporary , it was n't considered necessary to go to the expense of hiring costumes , so consequently my outfit was borrowed from Jane , the daughter of my housemaster , who lived with her parents in a detached cottage next to the school . <p> So one afternoon I had to go round to their house to be fitted out by my housemasters wife and daughter . Being dressed up by them was absolute bliss , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that theyd searched for something befitting a 10 year old little girl , and theyd certainly found it . It was a beautifully childish white cotton dress with a peter pan collar , short puffed sleeves , and a sash belt tied at the back . It had a row of buttons down the back as well , so it was probably the inspiration for the little girl dresses that feature so prominently in my stories these days . Needless to say , underneath I wore a pair of white girls knickers and a stiffened petticoat which made the dress stick out sweetly but not ostentatiously . For my feet they found some white cotton ankle socks and a pair of black T bar sandals . <p> But just about the best bit was when they were trying to work out how my hair should be arranged . Because the play was an internal school production , and not on view to the general public , they did n't  go to the expense of hiring wigs , so it was to be my own hair on display . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment with two bows of red hair ribbon tied tightly in my hair , secured with two white plastic hair slides . At that age , despite my relatively short hair , I really did look sweet . ( If only I had some photos ! ) What made it even funnier was that they kept sympathising with me at being dressed as a girl and having ribbons tied in my hair . Little did they realise that I was loving every minute of it ! <p> At the beginning of the play I had to come on as if I 'd just arrived home , so they also lent me Janes navy blue gaberdine school raincoat with a hood to wear for the opening scene . How I loved wearing it , and wished that I could have one of my own . <p> What made it extra nice was that I was allowed to store my costume in the wardrobe of my dormitory , and I made sure that I wore it after school every day for a couple of weeks during rehearsals . Again , nobody would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend to accept the sympathy of the other boys . Nobody even thought of teasing me , so It felt wonderfully natural . I remember that on a couple of afternoons when it was raining , I went for a walk down the street after school wearing Janes navy blue school raincoat with the hood up . Nobody in the village high street took any notice of me , so they obviously thought that I really was a girl . My secret . <p> I 'm not really sure , but I think that its because of the fact that boys and girls in the England of the 1950s led such formal lives that to me , an English girls school uniform was the very essence of what I wanted to be . And of course , the added attraction for me was that most schoolgirls had to wear their school uniform whether they liked it or not . The senior girls in particular must have hated having to wear the same style school uniform as their little sisters . To me , the coercion aspect does play its part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have is of the occasion when I wore a pink tutu . A friend of mines mother ran a dancing school in a very large house , and consequently there were always lots of delightful costumes all over the place . One afternoon , a few of us were playing cards , and each of us had written a few forfeits to be paid by the losers . Needless to say , I wrote down on one piece of paper that the unfortunate loser would have to put on a tutu and a pair of matching ballet slippers and present themselves to the class of little girls that Michaels mother was teaching at that moment . <p> Needless to say , I made sure that I lost the game of cards , and had folded my forfeit so that I could distinguish it from the others . I pulled it out of the hat , and had a real job pretending to be surprised and dismayed . So into Mikes bedroom I had to go with the pink tutu over my arm . I stripped off , and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and feeling how firmly it enclosed me . Mike knew how to tie the ribbons fastening the ballet slippers on my feet , and when I made my appearance the boys thought it was hilarious . <p> We waited until the dancing class finished , and I then made my entrance . The girls howled with laughter , and Mikes mother thought it was pretty funny as well . My only problem was pretending to be hideously embarrassed , when in fact I was relishing every moment . I could n't believe my luck when she thought shed add to the fun by making me keep it on for the next four hours , until it was time for me to go . At least she did n't  make me wear it home , as I cant imagine what my Mum would have said if I 'd arrived on the doorsteps dressed as a little ballerina . I tell you what though , there 's something really nice about a tutu . Perhaps its the feeling of being firmly encased in something that is the very essence of femininity . I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with a lockable zip ! Imagine that . With the gusset between your legs , thered be no way that you could pull it up or down . Youd be stuck in it until some kind person unlocked the zip . What fun ! <p> Well ever since those far off days Ive grown into dressing either as a little girl , a teenager , or a young woman . It just depends what mood I 'm in . I often venture out at night dressed as a girl , but I do prefer the security of wearing a raincoat with the hood up so as to hide my face a little , so I usually go out when its pouring with rain . But it always goes well , and Ive never been challenged yet . The only thing I miss is company , and I would so love to attend a little girls tea party one day . My white party frock with back button fastening , peter pan collar , short puffed sleeves and a sash belt tied at the back in a bow , is gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bunches with hair ribbons , and on my feet would be white cotton ankle socks and a pair of my T bar mary janes .

@@37517602 @6517602/ <p> You can consider this to be a letter or a cautionary tale . For me it is my own true story of how a spoiled , cocky rich boy got the comeuppance of a lifetime petticoat-punished in a way that changed me for good . <p> It started when my mother sent me to a birthday party for a cousin of mine , a couple of towns over . I would have to go on the bus , and I did n't want to go . It would be mostly girls , and at age twelve I was not yet a fan of silly young females . Also , I was kind of a snob . A whole afternoon with lower-middle class kids attending Sally Sandford 's eleventh birthday was no place for a cocky twelve year old ( almost thirteen , too ! ) , when I 'd rather be playing soccer . But she insisted . <p> " Preston , please go , and be a gentleman . You can take your friend Eddie to make it more fun . " She added , " Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy for soccer . " <p> Eddie was a buddy of mine , a nice kid but kind of a nerd whose hobby was photography . And none of my soccer-playing friends would be seen dead at a girl 's party . And so we rode the bus to Milford , though I was not in much of a mood to be a gentleman . I figured I might have fun teasing the girls and bullying whatever dumb eleven or ten-year old boys Sally had invited over . That way , they might let me go home early . <p> The Sandfords greeted me and gave cake to me and Eddie . Just as I thought , it was a party out in the yard with squealing girls in party dresses and boys throwing a ball around with no skill at all . I felt superior to everyone . <p> " What a handsome boy you are , Preston , " said Mrs. Sanford . " The girls will be crazy about you ! " <p> Well , I was n't crazy about them . It 's true I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my flaming red hair neatly cut short just the day before . <p> We played tag and it got loud . There were accusations of cheating , and one girl almost got splashed with mud there was a big puddle of black mud we had to avoid , but I enjoyed chasing the girls near it , to panic them . I was the terror of the schoolyard at school , and here there was no one my own size to challenge me . <p> " Mom , Preston is teasing us ! " shouted Sally . <p> " Shut up ! " I said . I did n't mind being a troublemaker , but I hate girls who are always trying to involve grownups instead of just taking it . <p> " Preston , you are out of line . You do not talk that way to a girl ! " <p> Uh-oh . That was Mr. Sandford 's voice . <p> I had to apologize while the girls smiled victoriously . As soon as he walked away , I told Sally 's friend Jane , " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! " yelled Jane . Darnanother snitch . <p> Then it happened . As soon as I started to chase Jane out of the adults ' earshot , a third girl came up behind me and gave me a hard shove right towards the mud . I fell forward , breaking the fall with my elbows , landing on them and my knees . All the girls and boys hooted loudly . <p> " Oh , Preston , " said Mrs. Sandford testily . I was clearly her biggest headache that afternoon , ruining the party for the girls and now I had ruined my shoes , shirt , and pants . " Follow me . You 'll have to change clothes . " <p> The boys had started a stickball game , but they paused to giggle with the girls as I limped up the stairs to the porch , covered with black mud . They all were enjoying my downfall , and the fact that I would have to take my clothes off . Eddie started to follow me , but I told him to stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wash up in there , " I was told . I went into a bathroom off the living room , undressed , and washed up . Now what ? ? I was standing there in just my underpants ! <p> " Come out , Preston . We 're getting you some dry clothes . " <p> Very nervously , I looked around the door and saw Mrs. Sandford standing there holding out a pair of shoes . I stepped into the living room , very embarrassed in just my Fruit of the Looms , but then stopped dead in my tracks . <p> " Those are girl shoes ! " And they sure were black patent leather , and the socks were even worse white and lace-trimmed with pink rosebuds embroidered on them . " I ca n't wear those ! " <p> A housemaid had already picked up my pile of muddy boy clothes and carried them away to wash . <p> " Do n't argue with me , " she said . " Put them on . We have three daughters here and no sons . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and put on the sissy socks and shoes , thinking , " Oh gosh , this is not how things were supposed to turn out .

I was so busy trying to get the strap through the buckles on the shoes that it took me a minute to see the most horrible sight in the world , much scarier than facing a loaded gun the Sandfords standing there with a frilly white party dress ! <p> I walked over and she made me step into this mass of lace and frilliness . She pulled the puffy little sleeves over my shoulders and buttoned it up the back , then tied the wide pink sash into a huge bow at the back . I could not believe this was happening , and I looked up to Mr. Sandford to see if he might take my side . After all , we were both guys , right ? Maybe a sense of male solidarity would make him tell his wife to find something less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with the same cold amusement as she was . I had bullied his darling daughter , and he wanted to teach me a lesson . And what a lesson it was . There I stood in a frilly dress so short that it barely covered my briefs . There was no way I could go outdoors like this . <p> " I 'll wait here until my clothes are cleaned , " I said quietly . <p> " Nonsense ! It 's a beautiful day out there . Come along . " They marched me into the front hallway where there was a full-length mirror . " How do you think you look ? " <p> One look showed me a very scared red-haired boy in a dress , and , oh heck ! my legs totally bare . I thought back longingly of my pants , how they had covered me from waist to shoes , dark and thick , zipped , buttoned , belted , and buckled , like a fortress protecting me . The exact opposite of now naked from the lacy ankle socks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hem of the frilly dress . And I had yet another horrible thought This was my punishment . Maybe they had only daughters , but even daughters have shorts , slacks , blue jeans , even bathrobes . The Sandfords could have found some much less way of covering me , but they were hell bent on humiliating me as harshly as possible . With very slow steps , I walked to the front door , which she opened for me . <p> " Look , everyone ! " shouted Sally , loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear . " Preston 's wearing a dress ! " Every grinning little partygoer had gathered at the bottom of the steps . <p> " That 's not all . You can see his underpants ! " laughed one of the boys . And it was all too true as they looked up to the top step , I knew they could easily look up my dress , which I desperately tried to gather and press against my legs , all too aware what a girlish gesture this was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinoline against my thighs . <p> The next hour was a blur of being chased around by the girls , who missed no opportunity to lift up my skirt , though I tried to hold it down .

" So much for Preston , the bully , the tough guy , the rich kid , the terror of the playground ! <p> So I snuck indoors to the den and sat on a sofa . Eddie had followed me and sat down beside me . <p> " As long as you 're dressed like a girl , let 's practice kissing . I 'll need practice later , for when I date girls , " he said , putting one arm around me and the other hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Wearing this dress does n't make me a girl .

What was wrong with this boy ? Did I look that fetching in the stupid dress ? <p> " Just practicing kissing , " he said weakly . " As long as Preston was dressed like a girl , I mean . " <p> " I told you boys to stay outside . Eddie , go outside . And you , Preston well , well ! Such a tease and bully , but give you a few minutes in a party dress , and you 're quite the little Jezebel ! " <p> What a horrible to say to a boy , but I could tell she hated me more than ever .

I knew they would have a very interesting talk with my parents . I had learned my lesson . And I wish I could say the lesson , and the humiliation ended there , but not by a long shot . <p> " I hope no one finds out about this , " I told Eddie , who was fussing with his camera , an early digital job .

Tina had had a very good year at her school , and had been elected Head Prefect on top of her many other achievements , such as playing the piano in the school orchestra , finishing top in needlework , Latin and public speaking , just to name a few . So the homecoming party was as much to celebrate those things as it was to welcome Tina herself home . There was also the matter of her and mine also - 16th birthday which would come up at the end of July , so celebrations for Tina 's return were widespread . <p> You might think that I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my twin sister 's efforts , but that was not the case .

However , as Tina and I were now approaching 16 , clearly her shape and mine were starting to develop obvious differences which became more apparent every time she came home on vacation . <p> Our family was comfortably off but certainly not rich , and we certainly could n't have afforded the expensive fees that Tina 's school normally charged .

Well , it just happened that Charlie 's Cycles was directly opposite , which meant I could drop in and have yet another close look at that racing bike I had long set my heart on ! <p> We did n't live all that far from town , so we walked the mile or so to the High Street and Mum headed into the Frock shop while I crossed the road to Charlie 's Cycles .

Hmm , what could they have in mind to be so pleased to see me all of a sudden , I wondered ? ' Hello , Timmy , ' called out Mum . ' Come over and join us , will you please ? ' I had no idea why I should be suddenly so welcome amongst all those party frocks , but I was soon to find out <p> Back in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself being introduced by my mother to the middle-aged lady who turned out to be nothing less than Miss Fotheringale herself , i.e. , the boss of the Frock shop . She was very nice to talk to but I quickly twigged that there was something being planned between my mother and Miss F. , in which I was going to play a part . But what could it be ? <p> Reality set in when my mother asked me to turn around while she was holding up a very pretty dark red party frock . I did as I was told , and felt the rustle of its satin material against my back . What the hell were they up to , I wondered ? I soon found out , when Miss Fotheringale whispered to my mother that it appeared to be a ' perfect fit . ' A perfect fit ? What the hell were they on about ? I soon discovered what they had in mind , when my mother said ' Timmy , I need some help from you but in return you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you interested in doing a deal with me ?

And that 's exactly the way things had turned out ! ' Wow , ' I said to Mum , ' that sounds a great proposition ! I sure could do with another fiver to add to my Claude Butler bike fund . But what exactly would I have to do ? ' <p> It was then that Miss Fotheringale stepped in to the conversation . ' Hello , Timmy , ' she said , with a sugary smile . ' We have n't met before , but your mother has told me so much about you including just how identical you and your twin sister , Tina , are in height and weight . We have both selected this lovely dark red frock as ideal for Tina to wear for her homecoming party , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . Would you be happy to be our ' mannequin , ' please ? All we need to do is a bit of ' fine tuning ' with your figure . ' <p> I felt so embarrassed at this prospect , right there and then . I mean , much as I adored my twin sister , Tina and was looking forward to her return next week , it was another matter entirely to be trying on party frocks for her . But what to do ? - I dearly needed more money for my bicycle fund , so after a few seconds of reflection , I agreed to be their model . <p> ' OK ' , I said reluctantly . ' Mum , I really could do with another fiver for my bike fund , as you know . So what exactly do I need to do , then ? ' The two of them then fussed and fidgeted all over me for several minutes , measuring my chest , waist and hips . That was followed by lots of whispering and giggling , before Mum finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bit of ' figure alteration ' if the frock fitting was to go ahead properly . I did n't quite know what she had in mind , being more concerned with the prospect of getting that additional five pounds for my bike fund .

She and her family were gone for the weekend and my parents were gone for the night . This girl had just been the local high school prom queen . The yellow satin and chiffon dress she wore as prom queen was there in her closet . I took it out of the closet and held it up to me . It looked like it might fit . I quickly took it back to our apartment and got out Mom 's under things and slipped them on . Then the yellow Prom dress . It felt so good , as I slipped it on and when I zipped it up in the back it closed easily , and felt comfortable . I added a couple of pairs of Mon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked great ! I did n't have any make-up or a wig , but the dress did it for me . Wow ! I looked great !

Four things changed all that : " Petticoat Pond on the Internet - " Two CD friends named " Karen " &amp; " Julia " - &amp; " Clare " at TG North . <p> My dear friend Karen , the Twentieth PoufBunny , designed and tailored a fantastic , custom made , beautiful " 1950s " , bouffant , powder blue prom dress that fits me perfectly .

It was a wonderful experience that will be repeated . <p> On my last day , during our photo session , while I was dressed in my new blue 1950s bouffant prom dress , two nine year girls came by the studio , and came in uninvited during my photo session . They were not suppose to be there , but little girls are normally inquisitive . Their expressions and actions made me feel like the prom queen . <p> The girls just went wild with envy , saying " You 're beautiful , oh , you 're so beautiful . We love the petticoats ! ! !

@@37517606 @6517606/ <p> I often wonder if we do n't  have a pre-wired program built into us when we arrive here on earth , which is somehow activated by our life experiences - in this case a predisposition to be abnormally attracted to things feminine . I had no great emotional or violent experiences that brought this on , only little things that seemed to trigger disproportionate responses . Maybe when God made me , He ( Ed : are you sure " he " is not a " she " ? ) experimented and took the model XP1674 male hardware and enclosed it in a package with the XP1674 female software . This would certainly produce different results than had hit the world up to that point . Perhaps even a more successful working model than had been in the past . This is the way God uses His principle of evolution . <p> My first experience was when I was less than 4 . My mother took me to a community parade in our small city . One of the marching units was a Scottish band , with kilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out in tears and my mother could not understand what made me upset . The presence of men in skirts was more than I could handle emotionally , and it triggered something down inside that could not have been learned , but must have been congenital ( maybe even hereditary ) . The trigger must have been very deep in order to have caused such an emotional response . Did it touch something that was dormant there within my psyche , waiting for the proper stimuli to blossom ? Was I born and predisposed to be stimulated as I am by this kind of an occurrence ? Did it activate my hardwired " executive " program and cause it to come into play ? Could I possible have been any different ? <p> My next exposure was at about 5 years old , when we were visiting family friends of long standing . I seem to have had a bladder problem of some sort , because I wet my pants . My mother did not want to return home , so they solved the problem by finding a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several years older . They were not just white cotton , but colored silk-like material , with small ruffles . This amused them to see me in frilly panties , so they retrieved the matching dress , which Rosalind had outgrown but which was only a little large for me , and they dressed me in it . They may even have tied ribbons in my hair , but I cant remember for sure . Thus I became a girl that afternoon visit . <p> The next event was at about age seven , when Rosalind sent over a box of her outgrown clothes for my slightly younger sister . My friend Stephen was at my house to play when we discovered the box . I really do n't  know who had the idea , but soon we were both deeply involved in trying on all the dresses . No real commitment that I remember , but I do know that my sister was outraged . She still remembers it today , angrily , 58 years later . <p> The event that really captured me was when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes for years which she would use with a friend . In this box , along with the other stuff was a long , floorlength skirt that had belonged to my grandmother and which dated from about 1910 , and a long lacy petticoat , to be worn under it . My sister had worn this many times with no particular interest from me . One late summer evening , when it had gotten dark outside , I suddenly got the hairbrained idea that it would be fun to try this on . I went out to the small backyard playhouse and took off my jeans , slipping on the skirt and the petticoat . There was a sudden and strong reaction that occurred within me , not like any that I had ever had before . It was like a switch turned on inside of me . I was suddenly exhilarated and filled with life and excitement . Indeed , I proceeded to run all over our large darkened yard , twirling and twisting to make them brush against my highly sensitive bare legs . It was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new butterfly-like being , one certainly never experienced before . I wondered how this had escaped me all my life so far . This had been voluntary on my part , and it seems to be the moment I became hooked . After that , I used to daydream about wearing dresses , particularly fluffy and ruffled ones , and having long hair . I even sketched floorplans of my fantasy cache of girls dresses and other clothes I secretly yearned for . I did occasionally repeat this event , by sneaking out to try them on again and again . <p> Nothing major happened until I was 13 and we moved . I had to walk through my sisters ' bedroom to reach mine , over the garage . My older sister was very well built and had some terribly interesting clothes . I would pass through the closet on the way to my room . Many times when it was convenient , I would dress up in her frilliest things . At least three times I must have made a sound when I should have been asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out the sound . All I could do was to quickly turn out the lights and to jump into bed , sometimes with a dress on , cover up and pretend to be asleep with deep breathing . It always worked , and I was never caught . My sister got married and moved away , but sometimes my younger sister would have something worth making the effort for . I particularly liked one lacy peasant-type blouse that she got , which I could wear off-the-shoulders and get turned on by . I must have put that one on about 20 times or more , always with an excitement . <p> At junior high , and later at high school , I was constantly being excited by some of the more daring girls . Very soon it became almost a fetish-like thing with me , with three major stimuli : <p> 1 . The off-the-shoulder blouses and dresses , which the girls were not supposed to wear on campus , but with which some defied the rules and wore anyway to provoke the boys . When I spotted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost being late for class , but then finding her again after class and before the next one . <p> 2 . The full petticoats which were occasionally worn , particularly if they were worn so that they showed a layer of lace below the hem . These were allowed , but had not yet come to their height of popularity . They were absolutely so different from anything a boy would wear that they really unglued me , totally destroying my concentration . <p> 3 . The occasional asymmetrical hairdo , where one side was combed back or over to the other side and fastened there with a flowered or jeweled clip , where it might be poufed out or come down over one eye . Basic variations on the Veronica Lake and Lauren Bacal look . These were rare , but when I spotted one , I literally almost lost my load right there . Any of the above would cause instant arousal and made it most difficult to walk around and not be noticed . <p> I liked the girls and dated , but I always chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my classes , since I was college bound . But I had endless , arousing fantasies about the bolder exhibitionists . Low peasant blouses , lacy petticoats and hair cascading sexily down over one eye drove me to absolute distraction , making me miserable , but never failing to stimulate me , whether in person , in a magazine or just in my imagination . I had several unresolved crushes , but continued to date regularly my senior year . <p> Four years of college , with a heavy schedule of classes , left me little time for partying or getting into trouble . I attended a university on full ROTC scholarship and had to spend every summer on training cruises . Several of the other midshipmen took it upon themselves to try to run me out of the unit because they thought I might be gay . I was not , of course , but merely sensitive and not masculine in my attitudes . I believed in cooperation , not competition , and in being kind to others . I also liked opera and good music , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed , and I became a naval officer . While at college , dating was difficult because of the then ratio of 4 guys to one girl , so I did not date much until my junior and senior years , again with very sensible girls , the kind my mother would have approved of . However one girl I saw several times a week in chorus did almost drive me over the edge . Carla used all of my stimuli , usually only one at a time , which I could handle with great difficulty . One day , though , she walked right by me on the sidewalk and smiled at me , her hair all brushed to one side and curled , a peasant blouse worn off her shoulders and quite low , and then a full skirt , held out by several petticoats extending their lacy presence down below the hem of her skirt and carefully placed there to be be visible . As she walked they rustled and swayed from side to side . She had a look of real self-confidence on her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with just the flip of a skirt . That was the single-most exhilarating experience ( where I was not actively involved ) that I ever experienced in my life , and probably set the template for the girl I would like to be . But I had the good sense ( or more likely the lack of fortitude ) to leave her at a distance and to continue to date the open and sensible girls . Sometimes I have wondered in life why I always chose the " proper " way and why I never had the bravery to try my luck with a sexy tart . <p> After college , I did not marry because I had to serve three years aboard a ship . The only real date I had in the three years almost turned into a disaster , when I called up an old flame from high school days . She was getting married a month later but wanted to see me anyway . ( But that is another story ) . After that I did not date for two years and then married the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sensible girl . <p> Two months after our wedding , she was to have her birthday , and she suggested what she wanted was a nice full petticoat ( now popular everywhere ) for her present . I now went shopping for the first time for such an object . I found several to choose from , some very stiff and netty , but one very soft , not overly full , very lacy , and very well made . I knew that this was what she would like best , and she did . I was finishing an MA degree while she worked that year . I was home alone on two days a week , when I studied for my orals . It was then that I revived an old pastime , after many years of dormancy . The petticoat was like a time bomb in the apartment , just waiting its chance to go off . I found it one day , tried it on , and was once again stimulated and recaptured . Next , I added a full skirt and then one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves and , best of all , elastic neckline . I now had two of the elements of my critical mass in place . Radioactivity could begin . We had three children in four years after I started work . I used to brush her hair at her request , and tried out a variety of styles , eventually doing the asymmetrical one , and explaining to her what it did to me . She started wearing it this way , which produced our third child only 14 months after the second one . She never would wear her blouse off-the- shoulder but 2 out of 3 was capable of causing nuclear fission . <p> I never lost my love of pettis , and when she would no longer wear them , I eventually found some for myself . At middle age , I discovered the joys of real commitment , when , for the first time , I dressed completely , with lingerie , stockings , heels , wig , makeup , long lacquered nails , artificial lashes , long dangling earrings and even her perfume . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away when I was discovered by my wife , and had to dispose of everything . Others were burned one day in a wild purging fire , when I tried to " reform " on my own . I even lived for 9 days completely as a woman , when my wife was on a trip . It was a super experience , day and night . I even had the nerve to go out in public several times , walking around the block , or in a neighborhood shopping mall , or finally going into two stores to buy things I did not need . I was driven and excited beyond imagination , but probably did not pass very well due to my large stature , my broad hands , and my non-desire to speak and make a fool of myself . I do have great legs , though . It is now only a memory , with all my collections disbursed to thrift shops or burned . But the experiences were some I will never forget . <p> I may be a genetic man and am strictly heterosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out differently . I love opera , good music and the ballet . I write novels and poetry when I feel inspired . I draw very well , I compose classical music . I am quiet , gentle and helpful . I do n't  feel competitive . I understand women well and always have . Never had a problem with a girlfriend wanting to break up , it was always me who did so . I understand instinctively how a girl should act , while the male role does not come very naturally . I shed tears openly during sad or very moving movies . In a relationship I would choose romance over sex any day of the week . I would have made a wonderful wife for someone . <p> I really enjoyed the presentation about Stella and Cora . Cora was my kind of woman . If I were a man , she would have turned me on . Guess I like strong women who know what they are doing . And if I were a woman , Cora is kind of the woman I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more daring , unpredictable , never letting the men know what I would do next . I fantasize that I would often dress in Victorian style , with petticoats , corset , and rather nicely bared bustline . When other girls would dress in short dresses , I would wear a very long , figure-revealing skirt and top , with long sleeves and high neckline . Maybe a catsuit . Where they would wear jeans to a picnic or outdoor activity , I would wear a very girlish pink-checked gingham frock , with low neckline and puffed sleeves , wide full skirts , heavily petticoated , a broad brimmed white straw hat , short white lace gloves and carry a lacy parasol . When they would all wear conservative long prom dresses , I would wear a silver micro-mini skirt with a sequined top , much like Christina . I would be one heck of an exciting date , but then I would be very old fashioned in my moral behavior . I would try to excite and provoke everyone but give in to no one . Teasing is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Scarlett OHara . Carla was an expert . Which one of us does not remember the girl who teased him ? <p> In retrospect , I have to say that I am pleased with my life . It has been good , with a wonderful wife and with many rewards . I guess I never was the great competitive male that I should have been . I made a good and faithful husband and an excellent father . I never made a fortune . I never got famous . I often wonder what my life would have been like had I been put together " correctly " , my male body with male drives and male behavior , or a female body with my inner makeup and understanding of female instincts and behavior . I can only guess . But sometimes I get a bit wistful when I think that but for one chromosome what might have been .

Even though I had noticed girls clothes before ( and even wondered what they felt like ) I had never actually worn them . That year my mother had arranged for me and my older sister 9 ( by one year ) to go trick or treating with 2 of her friends , Ally and Betty .

At this point , I was really enjoying the feel of these wonderful clothes . Next came the dress : A bright red knee length one with puffy sleeves . Then came the petticoat : A gorgeous white petticoat with multiple layers . I started to get an erection as I slipped it on and she finished the outfit with a pair of black patent leather shoes .

Tina will have her laugh at my expense ; and after today , maybe I 'll just have to do some of her chores . I just have to get through this , I thought . Tina had n't said ANY-thing about making me wear girl clothes in all the weeks of fighting and arguing . <p> My face was red as I reluctantly , timidly , opened the door to face the music . <p> Tina was waiting . <p> She barely looked at my humbled state before she led me back inside .

I was slow to react in my embarrassed state ; and she had a good portion shaved before I could stop her . I let her finish . I did n't have much hair anyway ; .... but then she lifted my arms , and shaved under them too ! I was stunned . The shock of all this was numbing , and left me confused enough that I was having trouble fighting her . I could n't believe this was happening !

Her canopy bed was covered in pink and white material , pulled back at the posts with wide , ivory satin bows . The bed cover was pink satin with white lace trim ; and the pillows were ivory , trimmed with wide lace as well . The pink bed ruffle was trimmed in lace ; and her sheer , white , lacy curtains were pulled back with large , pink , satin bows . Tina had twenty-five or thirty dolls , all in frilly dresses , all about her room . ..... ' all that lace , ribbons , and frills !

I just wanted out ! .... I could n't do THIS ! <p> I sat on the edge of the bed as she rolled one down , and began sliding it up my leg . This was so embarrassing . Why had I agreed to do this ? ..... I felt myself falling further into mind-numbed darkness and confusion . ...... NO , ... DUMMY , I thought . .... Think ! There HAS to be a way out of this ! <p> Tina was so slow and deliberate , as I felt the silky constriction encasing my leg .

She then handed me the other one , and told me to put it on as she had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . .... ' .. sissy GIRL clothes ! I could n't DO this , I thought again .

' now your garters . Slide them onto your stocking like I showed you . " She cooed . <p> I fumbled feebly with the garter ; and Tina had to help me . She patiently showed me again how to slide the garter onto the stocking top . <p> " You see , .... it 's not so easy for us girls . " She gloated . <p> " What are the sissy ribbons for ? " My voice trembled . I did n't really care . It was my embarrassment making me talk . <p> " The nice ribbons help to keep your garters from showing through your skirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't your nylons feel nice ? " Tina squealed . <p> I said no ; but I was lying . They did feel strangely nice , .... smooth and cool over my newly shaved and lotioned legs ; but it was something I 'd never admit to ! I looked down over the bra at them . The ribbons dangled over the darker tops . They looked so girlish ! ..... I felt so squeamish . My body was tense ; and I felt dizzy and flushed . I wanted OUT of this ! <p> She looked me over , .... then went over to her dresser . Sifting through her nylons , she found a pair with runners . She came over and placed one in each side of the bra . <p> " There ! " She giggled . " Now you 're a PERFECT thirty two double A. " <p> I squirmed , .... most uncomfortably . I looked down at the little ribbon bow on the sissy white band around my chest . What was I thinking ! I ca n't do this ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , ... but nothing came out .

Tina ! ...... I 'm not wearing THAT ! ...... NO O O O ! " <p> It was diabolically feminine ! It was a full slip , .... snow white , ... with three inch wide lace at the top and hem ; .... and it was so girlishly trimmed with TWO ribbon bows , ..... one at the hem , where the lace turned up into a " V " over the left leg , and one in the middle of the lacy bust !

No , .... you did n't ! I 'll kill you ! " <p> I started to chase after her as she ran from the room ; .... but I stopped when I caught a glimpse of how I was dressed .

I stood .... looking for words , but could n't find any . ..... She had me ! The terror of someone else seeing me dressed in her underwear was too great , ..... let alone my friends and everyone at school ! ..... They would rip me apart ! I wanted to kill my sister ; but the thought of her showing that picture sapped my strength ; .... and Tina would n't hesitate to do just that . I could n't risk other boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , .... and so gullibly stupid , standing there in such sissy girl things ! I was suddenly so undeniably aware of what I had allowed myself to be dressed in ! Where HAD my mind been ? <p> I was shaking and ashen as she lifted my arms , and pulled the silky nylon over my head , and down over the bra . It slid down my body , over my tightly held hips , and over my nyloned legs . The feel of the slippery , silky smoothness came as a shock and surprise . It sent ripples of electricity up my legs as the lacy hem settled over the tops of the nylons . I could n't help myself .... as I reached down and slid the slip again over my silken thighs . I squirmed , as my girdle suddenly became most uncomfortable ; and I blushed a crimson red at my weakness and embarrassment in front of my sister . <p> Tina adjusted the ribbon straps , and then pulled me over to the mirror . .

It would mean so much to me if we could pretend for just a little while . " <p> I was helpless ! My masculine confidence and bravado had deserted me ! I was a quivering , blubbering sissy in the arms of my hated nemesis .... Christine . But to my amazement , she was n't gloating . She made it sound like I would be helping HER ! The words " little while " echoed in my head . But looking down at the lace " V " over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ca n't " .... I trembled . I looked so girlish ! And I felt so weak !

Besides , you make such a pretty girl . You have no choice now , so just relax and let me dress you . You 'll make a nice little sister , ..... ok ? <p> I felt so strange . .... I felt so defenseless and ashamed . I had nearly always dominated confrontations with Tina ; but I was losing this one very badly ; .... and my crying only made things worse . I was so confused .

In fact , I had teased Tina , unmercifully , when she had worn it . <p> The dress had lace trimmed ruffles over the shoulders and around the cuffs , with one smaller ruffle across the top of the chest . It had a small , rounded , lace trimmed collar , and from the neck to the ruffled bodice was embroidered lace with material underneath . In the middle of the chest was a large ribbon bow , whose ends draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pink satin sash that had to be tied in back ; and the full skirt was taffeta . .....

" <p> Tina looked at the dress , and then at me . ..... I was surprised when she remarked : " Ok , you do n't have to . ..... You can wear what you have on . " <p> For a moment I was relieved ; but then sitting there in the outlandishly laced slip with the embroidered milky mounds , dainty straps , and ribbon bows , I was n't sure it was a victory . <p> " Let 's go show mom ! " <p> " Go downstairs ? ..... ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't stay here all day . " <p> " Wait ! ..... I .... uh ..... I 'll ..... I 'll ... wear the dress . " <p> My own words surprised me .

" Tina cooed , smiling , as she pulled it over my head . <p> My head emerged from the satiny whisperings of the dress ; and I was met with the sight of pink , ... and ruffled lace . Tina zipped it in back , and hooked the clasp at the neckline . She tied the satin sash in a big bow , and the ends streamed down the back of the dress . <p> She fluffed the dress , and then smoothed the ribbon in front , before leading me over to her full-length mirror . She was radiant as she looked me over head to toe , and hugged me from behind . <p> I was so wrong ! I could n't do this ! Not ME ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't think straight . ....

My legs wobbled , along with the rest of my body . Tina giggled . She stood and hugged me . <p> " You 're trembling ! Relax , .... you are going to look so sweet as a girl . " <p> Then as she stood behind me looking at my reflection , she remarked : " But what are we going to do with your hair ? " <p> I felt paralyzed ! ..... There were times when I ate ice cream too fast , and got a burning cold near the back of my throat , and was unable to do or think about anything for about a minute , .... as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frozen now ; ... and I would gladly trade the painful cold for the frilly pink image that looked back from that mirror ! <p> Tina pulled me over and sat me at her vanity . It was just in time , as I was having trouble keeping my feet under me . I had lost all feeling in my weak , quivering body . <p> She brushed , combed , and fussed with my hair for several minutes . It was a little longer than most boys ; but by girl standards , it was short . Tina gave up , and pulled a pink , silky scarf from her vanity drawer . She slid it over my head , and tied it softly under my chin . <p> She then sat beside me , and picked up a lipstick . I recoiled . She grasped my chin , and pressed the pink tube to my lips . <p> I was trembling in abject fear and degradation ; but at this point , I kind of gave up all hope , and relaxed . There I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lacy underwear , and pink lipstick . I let Tina have her fun ; .... and she was having a ball ! I was bewildered , uncoordinated , and weak . I could n't have stopped her . <p> She smiled , and turned my face to the mirror . <p> " It 's petal pink . What do you think . " <p> I was dumb . <p> She let out a squeal , hugged me , and then took a mascara brush to my lashes . She told me to look up , then down , and then to close my eyes , as she applied blue eye shadow to my lids . She scolded me , as even my eyelids trembled . Once again turning my face to the mirror , she remarked about how much bluer my eyes looked . I nodded mechanically . <p> Tina took a file and clippers to my nails , cleaning and shaping them ; and then she pushed the scarf back , applied a beige liquid to my face , and patted on face powder .

When I was 12 years old , the PTA at our school decided to hold a wedding . A womanless wedding is just what it says . All parts of the wedding , male and female , are played by men . That year the organizers asked my father to play the bride . My best friend 's father was the groom . My mother and other women in the club made the dresses and conducted the rehersals . On the night before the program a dress rehersal was held . My mother let me come to the room where all the men were being dressed as women . The male characters were not in the room . I found myself very excited for reasons that I could not explain . The men were in various stages of dress . Some were just dressed iin a bra and panties .

About two hours before the show , my father said that he had just received news that the young boy who was to have played the part of the flowergirl had become sick . He and my mother volunteered me for the part . I had not seen a flower girl the night before and later suspected that they sprung this on me suddenly so I could not protest . My mother took me to the dressing room . Two other wives were there . They told me to remove my male clothing . I had not year begun to grow body hair so they saw no need to shave me . One woman handed me a pair of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went into a booth with a curtain , removed my male underpants and put on the panties . I was thrilled by how they felt next to me .

Our friend fastened the stockings to the garter . I was nervous because I began to get an erection but she seemed not to notice . I put on my white satin slippers . My mother then placed a silk slip and petticoats over my head . Then came the dress - a long lace dress with a pink ribbon on the front . My mother applied make-up , rouge , and lip stick . A blond wig with souther style curls was placed on my head . I looked in the mirror and was stunned . I looked beautiful .

My father then sat down and the groom lifted his skirt and took pulled down his garter belt . The audience went wild . Then the groom asked me to sit down . He lifted up my skirt , in fact pushed it high so you could see my panties , and drew down the garter . I immediately got an erection that all could see because my dress was so high . I found myself enjoying a girl and was disappointed when the night ended . <p> Years later I was at the University . A sorority decided to hold a womanless wedding . I was chosen to be the bride .

After we exchanged the vows , he placed his hand on my bare back and just before he kissed me whispered " open your mouth " . I open slightly and he proceeded to place his tongue on mine and then kissed me . The audience cheered . When we danced , he held his hand close to the top of my fannie and told me I looked beautiful .

In the limo on the way back to the sorority house , he pulled me to him and kissed me . He ran his hand up my skirt and held it over my bulging panties . A week later he called and asked me out on a date . I was confused because I am not gay and I did n't believe he was . But I accepted .

She obviously felt comfortable , and this meant I saw her many times get out of her slacks or housedress , put on nylons and all kinds of beautiful dresses , complete with crinolines and slips . One very fond memory is her putting on her nylons with me sitting next to her on the bed . After dressing , she would apply makeup always ending with her lipstick . When I was 6 ( and I remember because I had just started grade one ) , I was there by her side hanging in her room as she got dressed to go out one evening . This was before the babysitter came . My parents had a large full size mirror , and she always stood in front of it as she put on her makeup . On this occasion , as she did it , I told her I wanted to try the lipstick too . She smiled and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a boy . " I insisted , and insisted and finally she gave in . She told me to sit on the bed next to her and started to apply the lipstick on me . Once she put it on my top lip she then showed me how to roll the colour onto my lower lip . And then she filled it in . I knew how to do it anyway from having observed her so many times . After she was finished she told me to come to the mirror and look . I remember her also saying " you look so sweet , you would make a beautiful little girl with that round face of yours . " I remember saying to her that it would be fun , as I admired myself . She took the lipstick off after a few minutes and said , " We do n't want your babysitter to see you like that .

The next week , as she was going through the same dressing routine , I insisted once again that she put the lipstick on me . This time she did it without a lot of fuss and she even said , " You 're so pretty , I should get you a dress too . Would you like that ? " I was mesmerized and mumbled out an OK . The very next day when I got home from school , she called me into her bedroom and said she had something special for me . When I walked in , there on her bed laid out so beautifully was a gorgeous yellow dress with puffy sleeves and lace on the front and edges . There was also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very lacy white panties and little socks and shoes as well . She said , " Come on , you wanted to be a girl , let 's see how you look .

Then the beautiful dress which was so soft and puffy , than the the ankle socks and shoes . She insisted that I should n't look in the mirror yet , but wait until she was finished . I loved the feeling of being dressed as a girl with such pretty clothes and kept feeling the material of the dress and enjoying the lovely sensation of the silky nylon panties rubbing against the skirt . My mother then pulled out a paper bag and said , " Here 's something that will make you so sweet . " It was wig ! When she put it on my head it came halfway to my shoulders .

She asked me if she had gone too far and it was time to end this game . I remember sobbing and telling her I was so happy that I wish I could dress like this all the time . We then sat on the bed and she explained to me that I could n't dress like a girl all the time and that this was our special secret that know one else could know about . Since my father always came home past 6 o'clock , she said as soon as I got home from school I could dress up , but had to be a boy again by 6 .

I 'm still unsure if I was acting or if I was in touch with a suppressed feminine persona , but I won the dare hands down , and a deeper respect from those catty female friends ; they later explained that if I would have appeared in a cheesy thrift shop dress and somebody 's grandmother 's shoes , then their point about a man 's sensitivity would have been proven . Because I invested the time to find shoes , makeup , a wig , a killer dress , and all necessary lingerie , and then allowed myself to actually experience the role , I was able to win their approval . I felt empowered when I was dressed as a tall woman , and many of the friends at the party , well aware that I was wearing both foundation and pretty undergarments beneath the dress , directed kudos my way for displaying the nerve to show up dressed to the nines . <p> Joy 27 May 98 <p> Wearing dresses Sissy ? No - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in them . Oh no , not by a long shot ! You want to know what sissy is ? Sissy is me trying to get up enough courage to wear a scrunchie on my hair outside - at any time ! Never mind the fact that most would n't see it ! My front porch is like a stage - no foolin ' - every time I walk out on it I feel as if every eye down that T junction street is turned my direction at that second . And I can see that porch from down the road a half a mile away too ! Never mind that no one would care to look ! Now if THAT is n't being Sissy - what is ? ? ? Surly not wearing dresses , and FOR SURE not going out in them . Oh no - that is being bolder than bold . To Erin and Kerian I take my cap off to you both - you are TRULY bold ! ! ! <p> Erin MacGuire 25 May 98 <p> I agree wholeheartedly with the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other undertakings of feminine dress is truly a brave person . Each stage of going en femme is to be considered another high water mark in the personal growth of one 's personality . <p> Going out in public is the next logical step to consider in the growth of a Sissy . What an earth-shattering experience that can be . It is best done in the company of other Sissies first . From that vantage point , the next move will be a solo outing that will definitely enrich the life of a Sissy . <p> Last St. Patrick 's Day , I was called a Sissy for the gold earring I wore at a party . On this occasion , I was not insulted or offended . My only regret was that I was not en femme at the time . I consider the name SISSY as a badge of courage , not the mark of Cain . Most of my life I have been considered much less than masculine , and it used to bother me to some degree ; but when I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my inner femininity . <p> Little did my wife know that when she encouraged me to get in touch with my inner child and feminine side that I would find a little girl living in me . <p> My LG personality has permeated my adult male life and made me a better and more understanding person of diverse peoples , for which I am eternally grateful . I find and enjoy beauty every place I look and have a new-found appreciation for the struggles of the fairer sex . <p> I 'm proud to be a SISSY , and actually glow when referred to as one . My screen name at Erols also indicated my feelings about the subject too . Someone laughed and mentioned the Erinboy sounded like a sissy name . I replied " only to the ears of the beholder . " <p> Kerian 24 May 98 <p> You bet you have to be brave to wear petticoats or other frilly thing . This is not just my own opinion but some women who have seen me cross dressed in my yards and yards of petticoat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Men are by generally trained by society to not show a soft side and not be attracted to soft frilly things . Some of us are very touch oriented and become attracted to frilly things anyway because of the way they feel and others may have not been taught to fully suppress their feminine side , leaving them with a gender identity that is somewhat between the society male role and the society female role . I believe that in my case both of these factors played a part in my attraction to petticoats and other frilly things . <p> Since men who play the society male role have pretty well suppressed their feminine identity they are unable to understand or cope with another man who is dressed in drag . The only answer for them seems to be that a man who wears feminine attire wishes to be a woman , and it therefore a sissy . I do not have evidence to support this but I suspect that most men who have adopted the society male role model as their way to live feel extremely threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are confronting them with the idea that it is ok to have a soft side , and this directly contradicts what they have been taught . When people feel threatened they are much more likely to respond with physical violence that at any other time , and the real threat of physical violence does make me careful about where I go cross dressed . Truck stops are probably not the best place to be seen wearing a dress . <p> Regardless of the label of society I am far from being a sissy even though as I write this I am wearing a nice ladies ' square dance outfit with big petticoat . It makes me feel nice and there is nothing wrong with wanting to feel nice about oneself . I am not an effeminate male ( which is the definition of a sissy ) simply because I enjoy wearing nice frilly clothes . 
@@37517624 @6517624/ <p> Okay , here is my story . I would stand and talk to my mommy when she was a young woman around 23 ; would sew all day at home for pleasure and for herself and the family . I would of been four or five . It was the mid ' 50 's . I was such a mommy 's boy , such a true sissy . I now , many years later , am very , very proud I was and still am . I loved being so sissy . I sewed ( by hand ) and had a doll house I adored that Mommy helped me with . She stood up for my feminine behavior to my father , who hated it , but was always fair and never said a word to me . I would later spend every morning talking to her from her bedroom door as she dressed . I would study her as she put on her girdle , hose and then , slip or petticoat . Then she would slide into her dress , fix her hair , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sticky curlers ( which are best ) and then taking out the bobby pins that held the pin curls in place . Brushing out her hair was always so meaningful to me . It was so feminine - I wanted her to curl mine so badly . I would stay there , paying very close attention as she would finish by curling her eyelashes , and applying her makeup . I so wanted to be like her . <p> As time would pass I became aware I was n't a real boy . I was a girly ultra sissy boy . I sometimes felt intimidated and scared of real boys . I hated sports , I loved to create but I was trapped . <p> One day , to my amazement , she decided that we were going to the school Halloween party . She was unaware now that I was eleven , that I adored everything girly and feminine . So much to my delight and horror , I was told that I was going to go as a girl . Sound familiar ? Everything I am relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you well imagine , I did not want anyone to see me . I had been crossdressing for years when Mommy was away . Never caught , but looking back , I know she knew because she would keep all her feminine lingerie nearly folded a special way . This I so remember . <p> She was punishing me or testing me , I do n't know which . But I donned the matching pencil skirt and jacket , and since my hair was ( unfortunately ) not long as a girl 's might be , she put a cute hat of hers on my head and used a bobby pin to hold it to my hair . I was horrified . I also was in heaven . I wish I could live that day over . I am sure if I could that I would of gone up to her the next day and asked if I could wear another dress . I always will wish for that . <p> Now time passes , I crossdress often and am never caught . As I so thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high school . My parents were out of town . I was alone at home . I was going to take full advantage of this . I love , I mean adored petticoats ( do n't we all ! ) , and I had no way to wear one as my mommy had gotten rid of them years ago , sadly . To compensate , I put on nearly every half slip and full slip I could find of my Mommy 's . So on this day I wanted to be a teenage girl so , so badly . I curled my short hair with bobby pins , and I put on panties , many slips , and a really pretty pink gingham dress with a full skirt . I loved that dress - I wish I had it now . With my hair up to be curled , I wanted feel like totally girly girly girl . I wanted to be the ultimate sissy , so I put on a bouffant style hair dryer ( pink of course ) over my curled hair and cleared my skirt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my hair dried . I was in Girl Heaven . <p> More years pass , I am now 28 - it 's 1978 . My mommy had invited me to go along with her to Las Vegas . Just she and I. I was at the same time deciding that I wanted to trim my long hair that was shoulder length . But this time I was going to go to a beauty parlor . I wanted a girl 's style . I had my hair done before we went ; I had made up my mind I wanted to come out in the open with her . Mommy is very domineering , but I no longer wanted to argue and be antagonistic with her as I had been . I knew I would be giving her all the power over me . I knew she would use my vulnerabilities against me as she had done so often to others . She could be so nice and so cruel too . But I wanted to release my secret and my self to her control . <p> We went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mommy . I had drunk a bit to get my courage up . I went to the restroom and made up my mind to do it . I came back and sat down and we continued to talk . <p> I remember her saying , " You are just like your father . " Well , that was my opening . I replied , " No , I am like my mother , " I then said in a blurt and I should of been more tasteful . " What did you think when I was wearing all your dresses " <p> My mommy was shocked . Stunned . I should of been prepared better . <p> We talked for hours on end . But to my utter dismay , instead of thinking she would be greeting this with open arms , she was a little upset and taken aback . She used to tell me often how she wished I had been a girl . She would take my long blonde hair and fondles it , saying she wish she had my hair . I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> She and I went back to the room we shared . I got up the next day and went for coffee . I found a drug store along the way and I bought a fashion and hairdo magazine for us to talk girl talk about ; I also bought nylons . Later we went out together In pantyhose under my pants , Mommy said it would be too hot , but I was just fine . As we went walking downtown I told her I need some girl 's underwear . We stopped at like a five and dime and we looked at some pretty wigs and then off to lingerie . I bought two pairs of panties and a half slip . Why I did n't buy a full slip I will never know . We eventually made our way back to our room . I took a bath and shaved my legs , put on my girl 's undies and went out in my slip . I said , " I wish I had a skirt . " My mommy was not happy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . And we talked for hours of girl talk things . I asked her to do for me the ultimate : I asked her to curl my hair . I was , and am to this day , so disappointed when she replied that she did not know how . I know she knew - she had set her own hair and her friend 's hair for years . I was so let down . I told her all I wanted is for her to keep me in dresses . I told her how much I wanted to sew and wanted her to teach me . Later , before we left , we visited a dress shop and talked as a mother and daughter . We were never closer . 
@@37517625 @6517625/ <p> My first experience that awakened a strong fascination with pettis occurred in my first year of high school in the late 50 's . I had just started to date and was going out with a girl that wore as many as three pettis at a time . This was n't unusual at that time , as most of the girls wore either pencil thin skirts or dresses and skirts with a lot of fullness . Cora seemed to try to fill her skirt with the maximum number of slips she could put under it . We had been dating for a while and I noticed she always let her slips show a bit when she sat down in class . I saw her on a few occasions pull her skirt up to expose 2 or 3 inches of lace . <p> In history class she sat a couple of seats behind me and in the next row . On a spring day she wore one of her favorite skirts and under it was a new pink petti with white lace . She knew well enough by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore the full skirts and lacy slips . As I glanced back she smiled and slid down in her seat a bit . This caused her slip to spread out a bit and begin to touch the floor . She spread her knees a bit but all I could see was the lace on her slip pushed between her legs . I turned back so I would n't draw attention , but it was n't long before I looked back again . This time I looked at the slip first and saw she had crossed her legs and I thought I saw white lace on her legs . She was smiling at me then sat up to straighten her skirt and slips . <p> As was our custom , I met her after school to walk her home . The walk home was always great , as we flirted and teased each other a lot . However any real talk of sex was taboo in the 50 's . Cora 's parents did not allow us in the house alone so we would sit in her back yard and neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were close together . This day we walked through the park and the conversation turned to her new petticoat . We stopped and she lifted her skirt a bit to display the object of our mutual interest . The pink petticoat was layered , three I believe , and edged with white lace on the outer layer of material . There were a couple more layers to make it stand out . She asked if I liked her pettis . I guess I must have turned red but I admitted that I thought about them at times and when I daydreamed I always pictured her in full skirts . She smiled and we continued to her house and went into the yard . I sat on the retaining wall as she put her books away . My mind raced , thinking about how I could see her slips . She came back out and , as our routine , I walked over to her and we started to kiss . I was standing on the grass and Cora was on the first step going into the house . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight , and I picked her up and let her slide down against my body until her feet were on the grass . This caused her skirt and petti to slip up . She stepped back and asked if I would like to see her petticoat and she lifted her skirt higher than before . She then lifted her petticoat to display white ruffled pettipants that were mid-thigh in length . This pretty well did it for me and she stepped forward with only her lacy panties between us and her skirt and slip up under our chins . I 'm pretty sure when we pulled away she saw the wet spot on my pants . <p> Fortunately this was the start of many great walks home . We continued to date and eventually go steady until I went off to school . Cora was a tease and I know she realized that she could get my attention with just a flip of her skirt or flashing her pettis when she walked by .

I was very lady like and at no time did I ever embarrass myself . <p> I hated to remove the garments when I returned home after a fantastic evening .

@@37517633 @6517633/ <p> I have been a devotee of " lacy things " ( petticoats &amp; rumba panties ) for so many wonderful years . All and any feminine clothing that is especially frilly , fluffy , and lacy and feminine-flashy have been the best things in the world . From the clothes of the fifties when girls wore petticoats as a matter of fashion to ballerinas with their fantastic tutus -- they just blew my mind ! However , once I saw my first French maid I knew that I was hooked . I soon owned several very sissified French maid outfits . I discussed my penchant with my wife , but she was n't particularly interested in participating ; however , she understood my feelings and , in essence , told me to " have fun " . <p> My wife never questioned my secret closet that was soon filled with sissy clothes . It was just something that she preferred not to discuss , although she never questioned either my manhood or my secret life style . <p> Every chance I got from then on , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business trip or just visiting , I become " Missy " . She knows that I do and simply let 's me do my thing . We never talk about it , as it is just a given . Thus my wife enjoys herself even more because while she 's out of the house I do all of the cleaning , and , when she comes home , it 's to a sparkling clean and organized house . She knows that I do wear women 's clothing when I clean the house , but she had no idea as to the extent of my wardrobe and the extent of my commitment . That commitment is simple : I go the whole nine yards when I 'm the maid , as my uniforms are extremely sissy , short , frilly , fluffy , lacy and oh ! so sexy , and are a combination SISSY- FEMININE- GIRL- PET-PANSY . <p> Furthermore , I assume the personality , persona and presentation equal to my outfit . I am quite feminine , very sissified and extremely happy . I believe that I am actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have acquired the mannerisms , movements and expressions of a young girl , I am quite believable as a female . Normally I wear either a tight , nearly transparent blouse , or a clingy dress that emphasizes and shows off my breasts ( silicone , of course , but enough to make me cry for happy ) . I wear lace wrist and ankle cuffs , the very short skirts are designed to show off the abundance of silk lacy petticoats . Neither my petticoats ( always worn very short ) , nor my dress , effectively hide my ruffled panties . My long , slender legs ( I keep them shaved ) are well-shaped and quite attractive , especially when I 'm wearing black silk stockings . So with a frothy , but little lacy maid 's apron and pert , little lacy maid 's cap , I am quite the young lady who has been " collared and cuffed " into domestic servitude . <p> I even make up my face fully ( which I am rather good at ) and , with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my pink feather duster dusting , I am quite a lovely sissy-boy-girl .

I will watch the time carefully , so I wo n't be caught with my pants down and off and replaced with girlie panties . Most of the time , she will call before she comes home to ask me ( 1 ) if I 'm having a good time , ( 2 ) if all of my little household duties are done and ( 3 ) to tell me that she was on her way home and when she would get there .

It has only one entrance and is quite open , but ca n't be seen unless one walks to the end of the kitchen and looked around the corner . It was a dead end though . I could n't hide . I could n't change . I could n't escape . I could n't move . My face was fully made-up and my outfit so " oh-la-la .

Thankfully , the women immediately sat down at the kitchen table which could n't be seen ( and vice versa ) from the pantry while my wife made coffee . As the coffee was stored in the pantry , she had to go there . " Voila ! " Who was standing there , nearly in tears , shaking like a leaf and on the verge of panic ! It was I , and it must have made a shocking discovery . The look of shock on her face at my presence and at my outfit quickly turned to amusement as she realized that she had n't called .

" Who cares , " said my wife , " I love him and he 's terrific . " <p> My wife 's friend left , but my sister-in-law lingered for over an hour .

@@37517635 @6517635/ <h> OUR ONE HUNDRED SEVENTH PINUP ! <p> Unlike many of the gorgeous gals here , I came late to petticoats , but now love them very much . When I was about 12 years old , I discovered I had an intense longing to wear frilly frocks and blouses . The period from the late 60 's to the mid 80 's was very good for Victorian inspired women 's clothing , and this type of clothing easily made up the largest part of my wardrobe . Gunne Sax and similar labels were my obsession . It was easy to catalog order a JC Penney bridal gown that was a Victorian dream . Unfortunately , that style of clothing became unfashionable , and my trips to women 's clothing departments became infrequent . The frills and ruffles I loved were gone . <p> I had visited costume shops and rented maid 's outfits a few times at Halloween . These were , however , of cheap quality and left me somewhat depressed . However , I had the good fortune to pick up Reflections magazine , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress ensemble , complete with apron , pettipants , and , of course , a petticoat . When the outfit arrived and I dressed in it , I turned to the mirror to see myself and literally went weak in the knees and fell . I felt like I had arrived someplace wonderful ; somewhere I was always meant to be . <p> About six years ago I discovered eBay and all the wonderful dressmakers who make those exquisite adult sissy dresses . I count several of them as friends now and my wardrobe overflows with satin and taffeta , ruffles and lace . These dresses would not be complete without two or three petticoats and I am more than overjoyed to wear them . <p> I have dressed privately for years ( tolerant , but non-supportive wife ) , but in the past year I have decided to share my passion with others and so have had a few makeover and photo sessions . I hope you enjoy the pics . I enjoy hearing from others who share this passion and love discussing all things frilly . jensatin4269@yahoo.com 
@@37517636 @6517636/ <p> The quality of original pictures from books or magazines usually surpasses that of downloads , so it would be useful to have a list of books whose chief value is in the pictures . <p> With the value of original pictures in mind , here is a list of books , most of them primarily as sources of pictures . Most do n't have pictures of petticoats as such , and only some have petticoats peeking out , but all have at least several pictures of the silhouette that bouffant pettis give a skirt . In fact , <p> I have given each of the books a conservative count of the number of good photos for Poufbunnies to enjoy . Most have some really excellent pictures for scanning . As I say , my counts are conservative , with lots of near-misses . I have usually excluded , for instance , pictures of even grand , full skirts unless they are clearly supported by big crinolines , and I have generally excluded anything not large or sharp enough to scan . I have also excluded pictures on dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( I have not usually excluded pictures with cropping , busy backgrounds , or moderate obstructions by purses , flowers , dance partners , bystanders , etc. , since I suspect most Poufbunnies find that acceptable , and the pictures could be edited by cutting or on a computer . This is the one respect in which a substantial number of the photos may not be up the standards of the petti-pictures at the Pond . ) Nevertheless , these counts are personal , and everybody would have a different count ( even I would no doubt get slightly different counts , if I made them again ) . These counts are naturally only a rough guide to the quality , but better than nothing . Incidentally , one or two of these books also come in small-format paperback form , with poorer-quality images ; my ratings are for the large-format version(s) . Many poufbunnies have some interests beyond just petticoats ( for example , evening dresses in general ) , and , in most cases , these people will find a good deal to like beyond what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these in a new- or used-book store should look inside . <p> I 've split the books into categories . These categories could be useful to any Poufbunny who is just starting out looking in bookstores , so some of the categories have only one book in them . Finally , the term " not rare " means that I have seen it at least three times while haunting used-book stores . <p> I have also made picture counts by the same standard as for the below books of a few books in the current <p> PettiBooks list as of March 25 , 1998 . This is for calibration ; you can compare Tessy 's evaluation of the photos with mine . <p> Vintage Fashions for Women : The 50 's and 60 's , Kristina Harris : 17 , with several drawings or paintings . <p> Unmentionables : A Brief History of Underwear <p> , Elaine Benson and John Esten : 12 , with several drawings or paintings . <p> Derived from the catalog of an exhibition . Lists 157 costume designers with their movie credits , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find out what else he or she did . The index let 's you look up the designer by the movie . Also gives the Academy Awards for costume design through 1988 . I know that there are other sources ( Video Hound , for example ) , but not with beautiful pictures to give you an idea of their work . <p> This actually is an exhibition catalog , with running commentary , exhibition checklist , filmography , notes , and indices . In addition to the photographs , there are at least seven costume-design drawings or paintings of interest to Poufbunnies . <p> There are not too many out-and-out Poufbunny-type pictures here ; one reason is that , although the pages are large-format , many of the pictures are small . This book is nevertheless worth mentioning , in large part because of the wonderful black-and-white picture occupying all of page 192 . Here is Judy Garland sitting in her famous frou-frou-covered dress from " Meet Me in St. Louis " . Her skirt is only slightly cut off on one side , and a suitor 's hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great photo nevertheless , and it would make a great scanned image . <p> All Talking ! All Singing ! All Dancing ! : A Pictorial History of the Movie Musical , <p> John Springer , Citadel Press New York . 9 Not rare . <p> Gone with the Wind : The Definitive Illustrated History of the Book , the Movie , and the Legend , <p> Of course , almost any book about this movie is a good book for huge hoop skirts . This just happens to be the one I have on hand at the moment , although I think it 's better than most . It also has a number of paintings or drawings of interest to Poufbunnies . <p> This is the catalog of an exhibition held in 1982-3 at F.I.T. , and it 's all about lingerie . This book also covers corsets , bras , etc. , but there is lots of written material about petticoats , not just pictures . There are also a number of drawings of petticoats . The text is in English and Japanese , since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One problem with finding this book : There is no title , nor any words at all on the covers ! The covers have lace details of a 19th-century dressing gown , which should alert a Poufbunny to look inside , but if only the spine is visible , all you can see is some buttons in low contrast . There is also a bibliography of underwear-related books . Definitely worth looking for ! <p> Changing Fashions , 1800-1970 , <p> Elizabeth Ann Coleman , The Brooklyn Museum , 1972 New York . 9 <p> This exhibition catalog is not rare , and will probably be fairly inexpensive . There is some discussion of the crinolines under the skirts . <p> Descriptions of the history and work of 61 major designers or fashion houses , lavishly illustrated . Most of the pictures are in color , and in a large format . Some drawings and paintings , too . Some mention of crinolines . <p> Frederick 's of Hollywood , 1947-1973 : 26 Years of Mail Order Seduction <p> Laura &amp; Janusz Gottwald , Drake Publishers , 1973 New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lowered my standards here , in that essentially all the pictures in this book are drawings , not photos . Also , there are only two clear-cut petticoats among the pictures . Nevertheless , I think that most Poufbunnies will find a lot to like here . There is almost no text except the captions on the hundreds of pictures of undergarments , nightgowns , skirts , and dresses . <p> Dance ( Again , the first of these should be on your main list by any standard ) : <p> A book about ballroom dancing , from the point of view of the late 60 's , when the norm was to wear dresses with many-layered petticoats , much more interesting than the norm today . Chapter Nine contains a discussion of these dresses , and of the types of dresses used in various types of ballroom dance ( Latin-American , etc . ) .

She would n't spray them long enough to actually freeze them ; just enough to numb them . Then she took something and put it against his earlobe with a wad of cotton behind it , and Beth heard a little pop . There was hardly a sting as his ear was pierced . Francine did the same thing to his other earlobe , and then quickly inserted a pair of alcohol sterilized gold studs into the tiny holes . " I remember my mother piercing my ears with a needle , " said Francine . " Its a wonder more girls did n't  get infected , then . " <p> " All done sweetheart ! " said Francine with a big smile . " here 's your little girl again Betsy . But this time he looks a lot prettier than the first time I first saw him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the mirror at the gold studs , a little smile on his face . <p> " How much for the piercing ? asked Betsy . <p> " For such a pretty little girl like Beth ? !

" <p> " Well perhaps in a couple of months I 'll have you give him a page boy style , but long enough to be able to put it in a ponytail sometimes , " said Betsy . " I think hed look very nice with with a page boy . " <p> " Hell look precious with any style except a Mohawk , " said Francine with a smile . <p> As they walked back to the car , Beth looked up at Betsy . " What 's a Mohawk Mommy ? " <p> " A style that you 'll never get as long as Im alive , " said Betsy laughing a little . Then she explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads . <p> " Well , I guess everybody knows I have a pretty mommy then too , " said Beth . Betsy almost felt like crying . She was so happy ! <p> When they got home , Betsy noticed that , although the key was where she had left it , it seemed to have been moved . When they opened the door , there was a big picture of Betsy and Beth on the wall over the couch . It was the one showing them sitting down together . They quickly went upstairs , and there was another big enlargement upstairs on the wall of Beths bedroom . It was the one of Betsy and Beth standing side by side with Betsy looking down at Beth with nice smile , and Beth looking up at her with a smile also , while Betsy had an arm around Beths shoulders . This was the picture she loved the most , and she was very glad another print of the same picture was hanging in her own bedroom as well . <p> Beth looked at the picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daughter dresses ; pink gingham with white secretary collars and trim on the short puffed sleeves , and a white sash tied around their waists . The scalloped hem of their white petticoats showed a little below the hem of their dresses . He was glad Mommy had bought these dresses for them to wear together , even if wearing any dress made him feel like a sissy , because being a sissy seemed nice now . He loved wearing petticoats and pretty dresses . And the picture in his bedroom made it seem like Mommy was watching over him . <p> I bet a lot of girls do n't  have as pretty a mommy as I do , he thought . <p> After a few minutes they went back downstairs . Betsy was thinking about what they should have for lunch . It was actually later in the afternoon than when they usually ate . Her thoughts were interrupted by the front door chimes . She went and opened the front door . Irene LaChance and Frances Coffey were standing there with nice smiles . Irene and Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with smiles and hellos , and Betsy invited them into the parlor . <p> Neither woman had seen Betsy for a while , but Katherine had called them both up and told them about seeing Betsy and Beth while she was shopping . As soon as they heard about it , both women could n't wait to see Betsys little girl . They both knew Betsy , but did n't  see her that much , since they lived on the other side of town . <p> As soon as they came inside the parlor and sat down , they both noticed the big picture of Betsy and Beth on the wall . " Betsy , is that your little boy ? " asked Irene , as she looked at the picture in disbelief . <p> " Yes , " said Betsy , " and now he behaves as much like a little girl as if he had been born one . Let me have him come downstairs and you can meet him . He s upstairs playing with a new doll I just bought for him on our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beth was standing in the parlor with a nice smile next to Betsy . " Beth , this is Mrs. LaChance and Mrs. Coffey . Say hello dear . " <p> Beth curtseyed like Mommy had recently taught him , and said hello to both ladies , smiling as he sat down next to Betsy on the couch . Betsy put her arm around Beths shoulders , forgetting that the picture hanging right over their heads showed them in the exact same position . <p> " Betsy ! I cant believe it ! " said Irene . " He s sooo pretty ! And look how his petticoats peek out under his dress ! He s so precious ! How long has he been your little girl ? " <p> " Since he started his summer vacation , " replied Betsy . " And he loves being Mommys little girl now . Do n't  you sweetheart ? " <p> " Yes Mommy . I 'm glad you turned me into a girl , " said Beth . " When I grow up , I want to be just like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about becoming a girl ? " asked Frances . <p> " Oh , a little bit at first , " said Betsy . " But pretty soon he saw how nice it felt to dress up pretty like a nice little girl . Girls have a lot more fun than boys do . Do n't  they sweetheart ? " <p> " Betsy ! You 're a marvel ! " said Irene . " Oh , how I wish I 'd dressed my little boy like a girl , too . But I knew his father would never let me . And now he s eighteen years old and has a girlfriend . Its too late now . " <p> " Yes . There are certain advantages to getting a divorce when children are still young , " said Betsy . " In a way I suppose I owe my ex-husband a little gratitude for taking off with another woman . With him out of the way , I was able to raise my child the way I wanted . " <p> " Well in my opinion , " said Frances , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a pretty little girl ! " <p> " Betsy , we cant stay , " said Irene . " Well be late for the beauty parlor . But I 'm so glad we had a chance to see Beth . He s sooooo precious ! " <p> Both ladies got up , shaking their dresses and petticoats a little as they prepared to leave . When Betsy and Beth got up , Irene noticed Beth fluffing up his dress and petticoats like a girl would . <p> " Oh , I wish he was my little boy , " said Irene with a wistful look . <p> " One last question Betsy , " said Helen . " How long are you going to keep dressing him as a little girl ? School will be starting in a couple of months . " <p> " Thats no problem , " replied Betsy . " I taught school myself for a couple of years before I got married , and I still have my teachers certificate . I 'm going to give him home schooling . Besides , he s so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boys at school would call him a sissy if they saw him smoothing his pants behind him when he sits down . And he wants to be my little girl for good now . Do n't  you darling ? " <p> Beth smiled and said , " Yes Mommy . Its more fun being your little girl . I do n't  want to be a boy any more . " <p> " And you wont be dear , " said Betsy with a loving smile . <p> " But Betsy , " said Helen , " are n't  you a little concerned about how hell be a sissy when he grows up ? " <p> " All I know , " said Betsy , " is that he s very happy being my little girl now , and so am I. " <p> " Betsy , we have to leave , " said Irene , " but I love how you 've turned Eddie into such a pretty girl . And I know hell have no trouble playing with other girls . Hell fit right in with the prettiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual hugs and kisses to Beths cheeks before they left . Then Betsy turned to Beth as they sat back down on the couch . " Beth , youd like to play with girls , would n't you sweetheart ? " asked Betsy . <p> " I have n't met any yet , " replied Beth . <p> " You will starting tomorrow sweetheart , " said Betsy . " I 'll invite one of my friends and her little girl to come over and visit us tomorrow , and the two of you can play either in your room or outside if you want to . Would you like that dear ? " <p> " I guess so Mommy , " said Beth . " How old is her little girl ? " <p> " The same age you are honey , " said Betsy . " Shes twelve years old too .

Later today Mommy is going to put your training bra on you and explain a few things to you . " <p> The next day , as Betsy watched Beth and Susan ( a friends daughter ) jumping rope in the driveway , it brought a smile to her face . She loved seeing Beth playing with other girls . At that moment she made up her mind , and reached for the phone book to inquire at the local hospital about the availability of the operation Christine Jorgensen had undergone . <p> EPILOGUE <p> Beginning in late 1952 and completed in 1953 , doctors had made a series of operations and begun hormone treatments on a former American soldier , changing his sex from male to female . Known as Christine Jorgensen from this point on , she became an overnight celebrity . It also had a learning value to the doctors involved . Soon the surgery techniques were improved and become common for sexual reassignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . It turned out to be the answer to her prayers as far as Beths future was concerned . But first she discussed it with him , carefully explaining what the operation would mean as far as his future sex was concerned . Beth thought that since he looked and acted like a girl , and had come to like being a girl , that he might as well become one as much as possible . <p> Three years later , after three operations and lengthy hormone treatments , she finally had a real daughter ... in all " departments " ! Whenever Beth thought about her earlier life as a boy however , even though she now loved being a girl , it still caused some tears to spoil her mascara . And she had to get bras with larger cups during the first year as her breasts grew . But she loved having her hair in the same style as Betsy . And her panties fit much better now !

@@37517639 @6517639/ <p> DENISE 'S FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT ENCOUNTERS -- how she grabbed the ring and ran ! <p> As most Poufbunnies , I have been relatively secretive about my crossdressing and perhaps you 've seen my item in the " Reflections " section about the braveness it takes for a CD to get all dolled up , even to the point of going out in public dressed . <p> My earliest recollection of dressing and wearing crinolines were actually one in the same . But , here 's the twist : I used to try on my sisters crinolines while she was in the same room ! <p> In the 1950s , when crinolines were pretty much a part of everyday wear for the ladies , my older sister and I had to share a bedroom . I do n't even have a clue as to my actual age when I began to try on her crinolines , but I was quite young and seldom had any time alone so I would usually do it late late late at night while sis was sleeping . <p> Typically it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming home late , I 'd already be in bed pretending to be asleep . ( Or perhaps , just waking up when she came in . ) Always a wonderful and caring sister , she tried to be very quiet and not disturb me . She often just " stood " her crinolines on the floor in front of the closet , which was conveniently at the foot of my bed . Once she was in bed , I 'd wait patiently until I was sure she was sleeping and I 'd slowly get out of bed and tippie toe to the foot of the bed . ( The emergency plan was if she woke up I was just going to the bathroom . ) <p> Once at the " scene of the crime " and with one eye always on sis and the other on the crinoline , I would slowly step into it and enjoy my special little world for just a minute or so until the guilt and fear that I 'd get caught brought me back to reality and I 'd reverse the process and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea I ever did this . She and I are very very close and although I 've thought of telling her of my crossdressing , one never really knows how such things will turn out and I 'd hate to take a chance of ruining a wonderful relationship . But , the thought of her possibly having the chance to borrow my crinolines now for payback sure gets tempting ! <p> ( added 1/27/00 ) <p> Jim 's and then Stella 's first encounters were magnificent and chatter among pouf bunnies is buzzing faster than the speed of light because of it . They brought to mind a much later chapter to my first encounter with petticoats so I thought I 'd share it with you . As Stella mentioned , in the 1950s lots of things were " taboo " to talk about , and a young boy who secretly tried on his sister 's petticoats was one of them , falling short of having been caught wearing them . So , my petticoat pleasures remained a totally private , deep secret for many years . Eventually winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me at the end of a seven year marriage unrelated to frilly things . <p> By this time I knew petticoats and the love of feminine things were a part of me that would not go away so I made a deal with myself that if and when someone special came along that she would have to know of this part of me . It was about 3 years until that special gal came along and when she did , we immediately fell head over heels in love . Sadly we are no longer together , but we are still friends . We worked in the same building ( for different companies ) when we met in the mid 1980s and we still do today , so this is also a story of love and trust . I ca n't speak for her , but I really learned what love is from that relationship and she will always hold a special place in my heart . <p> Within a month or so of our first date somehow I found the courage to lay it on the line . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but time only moves in one direction . ) I kept it short and simple by telling her I get turned on by wearing women 's clothes . Also that I did n't understand it , but no matter how often I decide to quit and give it up , that it does n't go away , that it makes me feel good , is n't hurting anyone , and that lots of other guys do the same thing . She did n't scream , did n't run as fast as she could in the other direction , did n't ask me to leave , nor did she drill me with endless questions . A great weight was lifted , but what about tomorrow ? And , of course , a great weight had been placed on her shoulders . <p> The next evening we ended up at my place and after a nice dinner we prepared together , we settled down in the living room . Eventually that courage from places unknown came back and I asked if she would like me to get dressed up for her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was minimal at the time , but I slipped off into the bedroom and put on a bra , blouse , full ( grey , black , and white ) acetate skirt , and petticoat . That 's it , no makeup , no wig , no stockings , no shoes . As I bravely walked back into the living room I did a little twirl in front of her as I said " I know I look absolutely ridiculous and you can laugh if you want , but I do n't know why I like to do this , but it makes me feel great . " Her exact response was " I wish I could wear something like that . " What a great sport ! The rest of the evening was a blur , but did not involve much talk about this " new " subject . <p> It did n't take her long to realize what got my attention and that a little bit of flirting goes a long way . So we had lots of fun times together . Once she even snapped my bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that a slip is also petticoat , so to speak , so she made sure to always wear a slip under her skirts and dresses just to tease me more . <p> Eventually the ultimate teasing event occurred . Crinolines/petticoats , as we know , had their place in the 1950s along with the DRIVE IN MOVIE THEATRE . Many car windows got all fogged up by the couples inside making out before , during , and after the movie . Of course , all those layers of frilly stuff under those skirts and dresses certainly were a barrier scorned by many of the guys while others found them to be so teasing , feminine , and the reason for the Petticoat Pond . <p> Ok , back to the mid 1980s , a few DRIVE INs were still in the area and we had visited more than one . One day she pulled the ultimate tease by putting on my acetate full skirt and a very full petticoat under it and insisting on me taking her to a drive-in movie . And what a tease it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't even me wearing the petticoat ! Some things never change , we did n't care one bit what the movie was about , just like the 1950s !

@@37517646 @6517646/ <p> My first introduction to " dressing " came when I was in the Cub Scouts . The pack was having an international night . Our den selected Mexico , and the den mothers had the bright idea of dressing us as Mexican girls . Needless to say , we objected to the idea , but to no avail . My mother borrowed a skirt and blouse from a cousin of about my age . The skirt was a grey wool " Scotty " poodle skirt . What that had to do with Mexico , I still do n't  know . It felt strange stepping into the skirt , and the ridicule from the guys in the other dens was relentless . The feel of the breeze up my legs was new , and somehow fun .

I found dress with a full skirt and eyelets , so I put on a lacy full slip ( a girl shouldnt let anyone see her bra through her dress ) and a pretty petti . The feeling was great !

@@37517649 @6517649/ <p> I have been a visitor to your site for some time . It is a always a delightful visit and I usually stop in several times a week . I 'm now 51 but recall some very wonderful experiences of many years ago when I was first introduced to the delights and wonders of slips and petticoats . I have fortunately never recovered . <p> Unlike many of your visitors and contributors I am not a cross dresser . However I would like to relate my story . I have debated telling it for many months but decided it is now or never . <p> When I was in the first grade an older friend ( third grade boy ) invited me to see something in his basement . We went there and he showed me his mothers full slip ( it was in the laundry basket ) . I was not sure what it was until he explained it was underclothes . It really seemed exciting and risquT . As I recall it was white and rather lacy with a satin ribbon through the lacy hem . Anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty and felt heavenly . I suppose the fact that his mother was , in my six-year-old mind very pretty had a lot to do with the thrill I felt . <p> We took turns trying it on . First , we tried it on over our clothes then on a dare with nothing else on . Of course it was large for us but it gave me an incredible feeling . Needless to say we ended up spending as much time in his basement as we could . I no longer remember everything but she had red , several white , navy blue , pink , light blue and yellow full slips . She had two multi-layered petticoats . These were soft and had ribbons and lace . One was white and the other multi-colored . This went on for just over a year and then we moved . I still know him but since after I moved we never talked about it again . <p> This experience planted a lifelong love of slips , petticoats and all types of womens lovely lingerie . I have an older sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to check out the laundry basket at home . The slips my mother and sister had were not as pretty nor as varied as those of my friends mother , they both had some lovely petticoats . The slips were all nylon and pretty by today 's standards . My delight ended up with me wearing these things as often as I could and when home alone I dressed to the " nines " and pranced around the house in seventh heaven . <p> I made it a point to look at as many slips and petticoats ( in those days petticoats were common , especially for high school and younger girls , although many adult women wore them as well . Looking at all the slips in the catalogues was a delight and I wished my mother or sister would buy more of them . Back then the catalogues had dozens of pages of slips and full sections for younger women and girls . That page were especially erotic to me , as there were so many full petticoats , in so many colors and with so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ruffles . <p> Well to the heart of my greatest adventure ever , it happened when I was in the sixth grade . As I said I loved looking at the girls that dressed in pretty dresses and skirts , especially the ones who wore full ones with petticoats . There was this one particular girl that lived on the hill above our house . She was a senior in highschool . Her parents were well to do - they had a swimming pool ( in those days that was really something ) . She was an only child and her name was Deborah ( not Debbie ) . I thought she was beautiful and was particularly taken with the clothes she wore . Back then all the girls wore dress all the time . Deborah always wore full dresses and skirts and almost always you could see the lace and ribbon of the hems of her petticoats . You could with most girls . <p> She always had a smile and was always friendly to me . She knew my name and always said hi and often asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . In any event I went to a grade school about 8 blocks from home and always walked home from school . Deborah of course went to the high school and took the bus home . It dropped her off about four blocks from her house , two block closer than mine . I make it a point , as often as I could , to be walking past the high school bus stop when it dropped Deborah off . Actually , it was not just Deborah that was fun to watch but the other girls as well . However , the only one that every said anything to me was Deborah . <p> I dreamed of sharing my love of slips and petticoats with her . It took such hold that I did not know what to do and was constantly in a state of anxiety , particularly when around her . <p> Usually she walked with two other girls for a block then alone the rest of her way home . This would give me three blocks to walk with her . Looking back I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in addition to my fixation with her lovely clothing ) . I 've often been thankful she did not have a boyfriend that took up her time or lived close to her , it gave me the opportunity to be with her . Anyway it was easy to talk with her because she kind of carried the conversation . I was shy of girls in the boy-girlfriend way but since she was older it made it easier . However , the desire I had to touch and wear her clothes made being with her awkward . <p> I have to say I was not a sissy type guy then or now . I played soccer , basketball and baseball and did well . In fact , love of girls lingerie was totally out of character with my " public persona " . Anyway on the fateful day while I was walking with her she asked me if I was " afraid of her or nervous being around her " . Of course I said no . She then asked me if I liked her . I told her I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was flattered . She asked me what I liked most about her and I just blurted out , " I think your clothes are beautiful " . Her manner and pleasant way made this easy to say and she did not recoil as if I was some kind of weirdo . <p> Next she asked me what I liked most about her clothes . Without thinking I told her I loved her pretty slips . It just popped out . As soon as I said it I was terrified . I figured that was it and she would either shriek or never want to see me again . Instead she asked me if I would like to come to her house and have a glass of milk . I was dumbstruck and must have barley been able to say , yes . We had about another block and a half to her house and she changed the subject and asked me something about my classes . I figured that was that and decided to totally avoid looking at or bringing up her clothes again . I was afraid she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home when we arrived . We went into the kitchen and she had me sit at the kitchen table and got us both a glass of milk . While she was doing this we talked about baseball , the season had just started ( it was April ) and loved baseball , I played catcher . After getting the glasses of milk and some cookies she sat down at the head of the table , I was on the chair on the side ( there were only four chairs around the table ) . Then she changed the topic of conversation a change that changed my life forever . <p> Deborah asked me if I wanted to touch her petticoat . I almost spilled my milk . She took my hand and told me to relax and not be afraid and again asked me if I would like to touch here petticoat . I could not speak and am sure she knew exactly what I wanted to do . She let go of my hand and lifted the hem of her dress and pulled it to her waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the nicest and prettiest I had ever known and she was showing me her petticoat . It was white with pink satin at each hem , little pink bows and the prettiest lace imaginable . I just looked . Deborah then took my hand and placed it on the petticoat at her thigh . I had an orgasm and was totally embarrassed . It did n't  take her long to notice the wet spot . <p> She stood up and told me to follow her . I was in shock but also dismayed as her dress fell down and covered her beautiful petticoat . I did not know what to expect . I 'm sure I was not even thinking . She led me to the bathroom and told me I could clean up and not to worry -she said it was natural and she was flattered . <p> I cleaned up thinking what an idiot I had been and figured I 'd leave , as soon as possible and hoped she would never tell anyone . When I came out she told me to come with her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I was used to seeing . She had a canopy bed and lacy curtains and it was very feminine . <p> She told me to sit on the bed then took off her dress . It was breathtaking . I was speechless and am sure my tongue was hanging out and my eyes were not far behind . She turned and told me she wanted me to enjoy looking . Believe me I did . She sat next to me and asked me if there was anything else I would like . By this time I was sure I was not alive and decided to just let it all out . I told her I would like to see and feel her slips and petticoats . I to see anything and everything she would show me . She stood and pulled up her petticoat exposing the hem of the slip she was wearing . The petticoat was just a half-slip petticoat and the top of the slip she had on had pretty lace matching the hem of the slip . In those days there were no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not see either that day . <p> I was just a little bit shorter than she and not any bigger . She went to her dresser and opened the bottom drawer and had me come over and invited me to take out anything I liked . Well , I just looked at and touched everything . There were 7 full slips and about a dozen half slips along with several dozen pair of panties . I was in heaven . They were in various colors , white and pastels . One set of panties was the old style " days of the week " panties . The panties were in more colors than the slips with red , black , green and then the light colors . I had never been more excited in my life , nor have I been since . I was on my knees looking and she was just standing there smiling down at me and encouraging me to look " to your hearts content " . I pulled out several of the slips so I could see them completely . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her closet and showed me four petticoats and two petticoat slips ( these ended up being my favorites ) . Each was prettier than the next . I also looked at and touched many of her dresses and skirts . All I wanted to do was bury myself in them . However , I was wondering what would happen if anyone found out I know that would be the " end " and I would be the laughing stock of the neighborhood and school . <p> Then came the question that really did it she asked if I wanted to put any of them on . I just said , YES . That was the beginning of the most wonderful four and a half months of my life . At least twice a week and often more often I was over at her house and we dressed up together . We never did anything sexual . We just enjoyed dressing up together . She never got into having me put on makeup or anything it was just dressing up in her clothes they almost all fit . She really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then taunted me to lift the hem and " show off " my pretty lingerie . I have to say that to this day I can still vividly hearing her saying , " come on now and show me you pretty petticoats " . It is the most wonderful thing I have ever heard . <p> I wore everything in her wardrobe , including her shoes ( they were tight but did fit ) . I remember how she would giggle as I first learned to walk in the heels . It was fun and we both did a lot of laughing . My favorite things were the petticoat slips . In fact that is really what encouraged me to write . The recent color picture of the three young girls in their petticoat slips reminded me so much of them , I just found I had to finally tell my story . <p> One of the things we often did was to dance with each other when we were both dressed up . Usually we had the whole house to ourselves . We never did anything when anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sure when her parents were going to be getting home . We often spent time " socializing " in the living room and danced in the basement rec room . <p> We did a lot of " swing " dancing . It was fantastic . I could really feel the sway of the petticoats against my legs . I always put on a panty girdle and stockings . The Stockings enhanced the wonderful feeling . Deborah had several varieties of " girdles " . In those days , or at least she did not have any of the garters that are around today , but I loved putting them on . I recall she often helped me fasten the stockings . As I have thought back this was the closest we got to touching in an intimate way . <p> We also did some waltzing that caused me my greatest " problem " . Twice I ended up soiling a pair of her panties . I know now that this intrigued and flattered her , even though it greatly embarrassed me . The problem was the wonderful feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we moved and swayed together . The fact that she seemed to really enjoy my being dressed up added immensely to the pleasure of it all . <p> Generally she had me pick out what I wanted to wear , that is , after she showed me what was appropriate and how to put it on . I wore her panty girdles , panties , stockings and bras she always stuffed the bra with several pairs of her bobby socks so I had an " appropriate silhouette " and the slips , dresses and bras " looked ladylike and mature " . It got to where when I came over I just went to her room and " dressed " . Often we just visited or discussed books while dressed up . She took time to show me how to walk and carry myself , sit , and of course do so properly . But the best times for me were when she had me show off my " petticoats . One thing I did as often as I thought I could get away with it ( which was regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slips she had on . My motive was to see her in it and to watch her take it off . She almost always accommodated my request . At times she would teasingly refuse . <p> I never saw her naked but often saw her in panties or panty girdle and bra . Likewise , I was never naked in front of her but we did spend time together in " our " feminine underwear . One time we dressed in baby dolls complete with panties and got in bed together . That was the closest we ever got to doing anything beyond the joy of dressing up together . <p> This went on through the summer up until the end of August when she went away to college . When she came home at Thanksgiving we visited for what was really the last time . We did not have an opportunity to " dress-up " unfortunately . During our visit she told me that we could not keep on with our dressing up , which she said she regretted . She actually thanked me for being her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very much and would fondly remember all her life but keep it our secret . It turned out she had a boyfriend and he was , of course , more important . I often wonder if he is as luck as I was with Deborah . <p> After that I saw her just a few times . She was always friendly and chatted with me for a minute or two but we never talked about our summer together . I never did ask or learn what motivated her to do what she did or why she befriended me . However , I am most grateful and will remember the experience fondly and longingly for the rest of my life . I have never told anyone including my wife about this experience . Until now it has been Deborah and my special secret . I often wonder if her husband is as lucky as I. <p> AFTERWARD ... <p> Several years ago I sent in this story of my most incredible experience , one that has greatly impacted my life . <p> I thought I would follow up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me . <p> As I mentioned in my story of 1960 , I am not a cross dresser , but am a great fan of women 's fashions , particularly from that grand and glorious era of the 50 's and 60 's . As we all know far too well there are not a lot of us left that recall and enjoyed those days . More unfortunate , there are few women that do . Most women I 've known simply are uninterested in these fashions because , as they tell me constantly , ' those things are uncomfortable , silly now and/or " dream on " ' . Well , I do dream on and very much love to indulge in remembering , trying to re-create and collecting . <p> My wife is wonderful in many ways , particularly she indulges my collecting vintage women 's lingerie ( and some more modern ) . We have amassed a very large collection of petticoats , full and half slips , teddies , garters/suspenders ( smile ) , gowns and 50 's and 60 's dresses , skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingerie . <p> My wonderful wife often dresses up for me in these things and we do have a wonderful time when she does . <p> I 've also been very fortunate to have met a lovely woman that very much loves this type of fashion .

We find and send one another pictures of petticoats , lingerie , etc. , often from the update pages here . She has ended up with a lovely collection and I 've added to it for her . <p> When we get together she models for me and we live/relive what we imagine we would have done had we been " adults " during those wonderful heady days when women dressed as I so wish they would today .

@@37517653 @6517653/ <h> Alex Finds Out <p> By the time we got back to the school and had out tea , my girls blue cotton knickers were sticking to my member and I could n't wait to take them off . <p> As I hurried up-stairs to my room I suddenly remembered that I did not have another pair of underpants to put on , but little did I know that help was at hand . <p> As I reached the top landing I heard a voice say , Ah , Alex , the very person I am looking for . It was Mrs McTaggert , I looked up and saw she was wearing a short paisley print dressing gown and a pair of fluffy pink slippers . As she leant forward to speak to me , the front of the gown gaped open and I had a wonderful long view of her pink satin , almost knee length , knickers and tan coloured stockings . <p> Alex , I need to have a wee chat with you and Ian . Go and fetch him , dear , ' she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other underpants and I do n't  have any , I replied . <p> No , buts Alex , we will sort that problem out once you are both in my room . <p> ' Oh , OK Miss , I said and set of back downstairs . <p> As luck would have it , I met Ian halfway and said to him You are wanted as well . <p> Who wants me , what have I done now ? ' he asked . <p> ' Its Mrs Mac , ' I said , we both have to see her in her room . And listen , she 's not wearing a skirt ! . <p> Did you see anything ? was naturally enough the question from one ladies underwear obsessed boy to another . <p> Yes , her pink knickers , I replied in an excited voice , but we better hurry or she may change her mind or even get dressed again . <p> As we went upstairs Ian asked , Are you still wearing those girls ' knickers ? What do they feel like , can I try them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're a bit icky in the front and anyway we have n't got time , I replied Come on . <p> I Knocked on Mrs McTaggerts door and I heard her say , Come in . We went in and saw that she was sitting in a round bedroom style basket chair and over to our left was a bed and , beside it , a wardrobe . <p> There was a large chest of drawers on the right , and I noticed that the bottom drawer was pulled open . This then was where she had got the blue cotton knickers I was still wearing and , inside the drawer , I could see some other white , pink and blue garments . <p> As she leaned forward , her dressing gown slid off her knees , revealing what I had seen earlier ; but this time , I could also see the tops of her stockings . So boys , she said in a rather low husky voice , what have you been up to today , as if I did n't  know ? ' . <p> ' Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out earlier ? ' <p> ' Yes miss , ' I grinned . <p> She smiled then said , ' Come over here both of you , I think a wee examination is in order , do n't  you ? ' We took a few paces forward . Closer darlings , she said . When we were nearly beside her she looked at me and said Now Alex , take off your shorts and knickers , ' then , looking at Ian , said , You will do the same , yes take them off . Then go over to the drawer there and find something nice and silky for you each to wear . ' <p> I glanced over Ian and he said quietly , ' You first . ' <p> ' No you , ' I replied . <p> ' Now dears , ' Mrs Mac said in a much sterner voice , ' Stop arguing or I will have to be very firm with you both . ' <p> On hearing her tone , we glanced at each other and both started to remove our shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realised I could see the suspenders that held up her stockings and the front of her pink panties ; as I watched she opened her legs a bit wider and I was able to make out the shape of her body under the tight panties . I could feel myself stirring in my panties when , suddenly , she grasped my blue girls ' knickers with both hands and pulled them down round my ankles . Naturally , my member sprang fully erect and then , with a smile she said , ' Mmmm yes , very satisfactory young man . Now do as your told at once . ' <p> Ian stepped out of his trousers , and I did likewise , also removing my blue knickers as well . <p> As we turned away she said ' Ian sweetie , underpants off too ' . <p> He gave me a shy look and slowly pulled down his underpants a bit . <p> ' Ah , shy are we , come closer and I will do it for you , ' I heard her say . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian standing in front of her , and watched as she slid his underpants down his legs and caressed his round bum .

' <p> By this time , my hands were full of lovely silky underwear and , spoilt for choice , I eventually selected a pair of girls ' frilly panties with little pink bows at the waist and several ruffles of lace across the bum . Pulling them on I spied a short waist slip folded in one corner of the drawer , and picked it up and held it out for Mrs McTaggert 's approval . <p> ' Would you like to wear that as well then , Alex ? ' she asked . I nodded and hastily slipped it on up my legs to my waist and then could n't resist rubbing my hands over the soft silky smoothness , and the feeling of it it sliding over the panties was most exquisite . I heard Ian move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of school knickers similar to the blue ones I had worn earlier . <p> ' A good choice Ian , ' I heard Mrs McTaggert say . ' Come over here and let me check they are not to tight . ' <p> As I looked at her , I could see she her left hand was moving gently inside the low collar of her dressing gown . Ian went over to her and I watched fascinated as she slid her right hand fingers into the elasticated leg of Ian 's , by now , bulging knickers . <p> I suddenly felt the urge to walk over and stand behind Ian , and my hand moved slowly down to touch the back of his knickers . I could feel the heat of his body through the material as I gently caressed his bottom . <p> ' Would you like to do it again and slide you hands over his soft frilly panties ? ' <p> ' Yes miss , ' he said again in a quiet voice . <p> ' Go on then , feel his nice panties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand over the prominent bulge in his front . I could feel him doing the same to me , and suddenly it seemed the most natural thing in the world to kiss him . I could feel him respond and press harder against my hand . I looked up to see Mrs McTaggert had slid her hand inside her full knickers and was franticly rubbing herself and giving out little mewing sounds . I slid my hand inside Ian 's knickers and gently wrapped my fingers round his warm hard member . He moaned and pressed against me , and I felt a hot wetness on my hand , and I could feel him shudder and sigh as he leaned against me . <p> Suddenly , there was a loud knock at the door and Miss Watson 's head appeared round the edge . Ian and I both gasped and stepped back from each other as Mrs McTaggert made a shuddering cry . 
@@37517654 @6517654/ <p> I do n't know whether it was my own desire or my older sister 's ( with some prodding from my mother ) , but I was introduced to wearing tights , petticoats , and party dresses at a very early age . For as long as I can remember , I have been fascinated with frilly lingerie and dresses ; and , by having the opportunities of feeling the soft , feminine material against my skin , I was never satisfied with just looking at pretty girls all dressed up -- I wanted to experience the feeling as often as possible ! <p> During my childhood , in the 60 's , when my dad was at work and my brother was in school , I was dressed up quite a bit ; often with my mother 's assistance and blessing . You see , my sister was the only girl in a family of 5 kids , and I was the closest to her in age . At the time , my mother must of thought , " What 's the harm ; he 'll outgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Nor does she know that I still crossdress on occasion and it occupies a lot of my thought 4 decades later . <p> We had some good friends who lived down the street ( a girl my sister 's age and a boy my age ) and we spent a lot of time at each others ' houses . We were devastated when I was about 4 yrs old , to find out that this family was moving because of the father 's involuntary work transfer . Prior to the move , they wanted to have a birthday party for the daughter ( Rebecca ) , but the mother wanted it to be a fancy dress party ( which meant that Kyle her brother and I would n't be allowed to attend . ) I felt terrible , because I was as good a friend to Rebecca as my sister had been , and I did n't like the idea of not being included . I complained to my sister and mother , and they hatched a plan . <p> Since part of our play activities included dress-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother asked Mrs. Hess if I could attend if I was willing to dress the part and be one of the girls for the afternoon . She mentioned to my mother that Kyle and Rebecca had asked her the same thing the night before . ( Kyle was willing to dress up a be a " girl " for the day . ) Mrs. Hess did n't want the event to turn into a spectacle -- she did n't want the gender girls wondering what was going on or the other mothers in the neighborhood gossiping . If she was to agree to it , it was going to be done right , including full dress , natural-looking wigs , and Kyle and I acting like real girls for the day . Without a moment 's hesitation , we agreed ! <p> I ca n't describe the excitement I felt on the day of the party ... After a bubble bath , my sister and I were both taken to her room and the dressing commenced . I was given some silky panties and white tights to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most crisp , white petticoats I have ever seen , followed by a pretty , red and white lacy party dress , with poufy sleeves , that tied in a large bow at the back . Then , she slipped a pair of white , patent leather Mary Janes on my feet . How glamourous I felt ! My sister 's outfit was nearly identical to mine , except her dress was blue and white . For the occasion , Mom decided to to add just a touch of rouge to our cheeks and let us wear some of her lipstick ! <p> We had to arrive at the Hess ' early because she was arranging for the wigs . Once we were all prepped and before the other guests arrived , we had a small celebration of our own , complete with about two full rolls of film , to capture the occasion . The party was a blast ; none of the girls there suspected anything ( they thought Kyle and I were a couple of Rebecca 's cousins from out of town ) , and that ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BRIGETTE <p> I had always been curious about the appearance of lacy , fancy petticoats and their matching panties . I was so jealous of my older sister who got to wear such lovely things . I was 13 , and everyone was out of the house one summer day . I went to my 14 year old sister 's room and opened her dresser drawers looking for her pretty things . I got out her prettiest ivory white full slip that had tons of lace . The panties were also generously laced and bowed . I stripped as fast as I could and put the slip on first . heaven ! ! I then pulled the panties over my hips and sat on the bed . I felt like the cutest sissy ever . I pranced and danced all over the room looking in the mirror at myself . I was standing at the mirror admiring my full lace bodice when I saw my mother looking at me in the mirror . She was not happy . She calmly went over to the dresser and got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on the bed . She then smacked my pantied bottom about 20 times . She told me to get up , take off my sister 's things and go outside and play ! She told me to never do this again . I said " Yes Mame " and she left . She never mentioned the incident again . What 's nice is that she knows I 'm a CDer now and every year on my birthday she sends me a pretty slip and panty set . My sister never had the pretty lingerie that I do now ! Thanks Mom ! <p> CARIN <p> In 1958 , when I was twelve , my mother and I went to visit my Aunt Lois in Illinois . The night before we left , she reminded me to pack my suit so that I would have something to wear to church . I hated going to church , and I hated wearing that suit . It was scratchy wool and it felt hot and constricting , particularly in the summer time . I decided not to pack it and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done , and she was furious . Obviously , I could n't go to church in jeans and a tee-shirt . I had a smug , self-satisfied expression on my face , thinking I had won the battle . Then Aunt Lois suggested that there might still be a way for me to go to church , even if I did n't have my suit with me . One of my cousin Bonnie 's outgrown dresses might fit me ! <p> The idea took the women by storm . I sat there flabbergasted as they laughed and planned things out . After two or three minutes , I flatly refused to wear girls ' clothes . My Uncle Gilbert threatened to take me to the woodshed if I did n't obey , so I sat down and shut up . <p> After a few minutes , Mother and Aunt Lois took me upstairs and made me take off my clothes . They pulled a white elastic garter belt up over my hips and put a pair of sheer brown nylons on me . Bonnie came into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace and a frilly satin taffeta petti-slip that had layers and layers of lacy petticoats attached to it . They helped me into the lingerie ; then Aunt Lois brought in a blue gingham peasant dress with puffy sleeves and white lace trim all over it . Finally came a pair of white patent leather t-strap shoes . <p> No attempt was made to disguise me as a girl or pretend that I was anything other than a boy in a dress , and butterflies of fear flapped in my stomach as we left the house and drove through the small town . This was a farming community , full of rough-and-tumble boys who grew up into hard-working , conservative men . I sat in the car silently , dreading what people would say when we walked into the church and they saw me . <p> We were a few minutes late getting to the church , and my face burned with embarrassment as Mother led me up the aisle to the family pew . I thought everyone would stop singing the hymn and stare at me , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few whispers , but no one said anything directly about my wearing a dress . After about an hour I relaxed and began to become aware of the incredible luxury of girls ' clothes . <p> As we were walking out of the church and back to the car , every step I took made the petticoat swish back and forth across my nylon-covered legs and across the front of my panties . It was a bright , sunshiny day , but I did n't notice . I was mesmerized by the gentle but insistent swishing . And as we drove home , I lost myself in the exquisitely luxurious fabric . <p> When we got back , Mother told me to keep my cousin 's clothes on for the rest of the day as a " punishment . " Some punishment ! I spent the day being acutely aware of the soft silky feeling of the petticoat and panties , and marveling at how luxurious they felt . That night , my cousin insisted that I sleep in one of her nylon Baby-Doll nighties with a matching pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first pair had and you know what happened . <p> The next morning , my cousin reclaimed her things . I was not dressed in her clothes again , but the experience had made a lasting impression on me , and when it was to go home , I snuck into the bathroom took the petticoat and two pairs of my cousin 's nylon panties from the laundry hamper and hid them in my suitcase . <p> Everything was fine for the next six months . Then , just after my thirteenth birthday , Mother discovered the petticoat and panties in the box where I had hidden them . And there were a few things of hers there as well . The punishment she devised for that indiscretion was more embarrassing than I ever could have imagined . But that 's another story . . . <p> I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and had a friend girl ( you just do n't have girl friends at that age ) . We used to play " school " together at her house , in her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good children ? ) . Well I was always the bad boy . Petticoat training started early ! I do n't know why I ever suggested she put me in her petti , but it became a regular play habit . I never undressed though ( I was a definite prude then ) . We were almost caught ( probably was ) several times . That 's another reason not to be undressing . Well we played together for several years till we moved apart . I have always loved girl 's clothes . I just have n't always been able to dress when and how I want . <p> DOUG <p> I 've enjoyed every aspect of slips and petticoats for many years but had only experienced the desire to actually try one on a few occasions that for whatever reasons , did n't materialize . I either chickened out at the last moment or the opportunity did n't quite present itself in an acceptable manner to pursue . <p> It was Halloween , five years ago that I finally got my chance . One of my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lingerie stores and thrift shops for unique slips and pettis to add to my wife 's collection . I enjoy the conversations that arise from this pursuit tremendously . This particular day led me to a vintage clothing/ costume shop called " Tickled Pink " . The owner was a mid-40 's attractive lady who was more than happy to lead me to a rack with probably 100 different pettis of every color and description . All I had told her was that I was looking for a nice petticoat for a Halloween costume . She somehow interpreted my statement to think I was shopping for one to wear myself because she replied , " Here 's a nice one that should fit you , " and preceded to drop it over my head . I first flushed with embarrassment but , after quickly looking around the store and noticing no one present but the two of us , became swept away by the eroticism of the moment . For ten minutes she fluffed and adjusted several pettis around my waist , talking constantly about how cute they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things getting any better but they did . Her assistant in the store chose that moment to arrive from lunch . She was about 19 , very attractive and was wearing a sheer white dress that clearly revealed a lacy white full slip she was wearing underneath . She immediately came over and without coaching , joined in with her boss in trying to find me the perfect petticoat . She helped in pulling them over my head , adjusting the waistbands and seemed to take a great deal of pleasure in reaching under the many layers and fluffing the pettis to make them stand out to their fullest . <p> Needless to say , I went home that day with my first petticoat and a memory that will probably endure forever . <p> GINNY II <p> I was 6 years old and began to notice lingerie . But it was n't until I turned 13 that this joyous feeling came over me . My sister was 3 years older and this was the spark of my wonderful experience . Watching all the girls in the fifties wear poodle skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear petticoats . I stayed home from school . It was time to find out . Waiting for everyone to leave for work or school made me more excited , but waiting made the fire burn more inside of me . Finally , I was alone . I ran upstairs to my sisters bedroom and went through her panty drawer just to feel the silky fabric that I have felt many times before . There were pink , white and various other pastel shades . I 've always felt guilty afterward that I had violated my sister 's clothes . The guilt disappeared when I got the urge again . If I remember , she had five different petticoats , all different patterns and fullnesses . I would gently slide just one on ; feeling the scraping of the fabric against my skin brought me sensations I had never felt before . I was in no hurry to test all five , as I had all day . I also liked to run downstairs and watch the petticoat flare out . This only increased my desired to an ultimate peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to be a girl and dress like this forever , " but I was never disappointed to be a male . I tried all five petticoats one at a time , then had all five on at the same time . I also slipped on a skirt and sat in a chair and did different things to make the lacy hem pop out from the skirt . My desire is to wear lingerie of all kinds , but nothing skimpy , I will never forget my very first time . What such happy memories and experiences I had from that day . I continued to skip school a lot more and each time I had as much fun and enjoyment . I added wearing her bra stuffed with tissue and a pretty white full slip and wore a dress and blouse . Forty years later I still wear full slips , half slips as , well as the good old standby , crinolines . <p> JINNY JO <p> Barbara was a 37 year old widow with a small child that I babysat for when I was 15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busted , with a very tiny waist . Her hips were more than ample , and she had very shapely legs ( at 15 you notice all of this real fast ) . Despite the ample hips , she regularly wore knee or slightly over-the-knee full skirts and dresses with frilly petticoats underneath . With the tiny waist , shapely legs and her propensity to wear 3 " or 4 " heels while dressed , the petticoats always were a mystical attraction to me , as I imagined feeling my way through them to explore the hidden charms of this woman . The thought of smelling her scent and touching the satins , taffetas and crinolines as I moved up her stockinged legs to her garter straps and beyond rapidly became an obsession to me . Though I had not yet understood it , she very well knew the effect she was having on me and was working her spell to move me willingly into her petticoat power from the very first time I was in her home . When I would come over to baby-sit , she would insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school . She would always sit just across from me with legs crossed and petticoats teasingly displayed . As she crossed and uncrossed her legs , the vision of all that silk and satin leading to her " charms " was further amplified by the glimpses of stocking tops and garters . Just about when my arousal was becoming uncomfortable to the point of squirm , she would get up and leave for the evening . Naturally , my obsession led me to begin exploring her closets and lingerie drawers in order to smell and feel those " charms " as much as I thought I dared . As I explored , I discovered she was a real lingerie aficionado , with all types of corsets , fancy bras , garter belts , waist nippers , merry widows and silky panties with lots of lace . All colors were there , but especially black and red . <p> The petticoats took a whole side of the closet themselves . Most were knee length or shorter . She had all types of fullness from very bouffant to Victorian . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colors were red , white , blue , pink , black , and ( my favorite ) a deep magenta . It was only a short time until I had to feel them on me and I began undressing and trying them on one by one . I would rub them against me and admire them in front of her full length mirrors . My arousal would lead me almost to orgasm , so I began to wear her black silk panties and take them with me each time to protect the petticoats from stains . Silly of me to think she would not notice that her drawers had been rummaged in and panties were missing . Well , it had to happen : One night , by design as I later figured out , she returned early one night and had quietly moved into the hall leading to her bedroom where she could watch me while I played and enjoyed the charms of her lingerie . I do n't know how long she was there , but suddenly I looked around and there she stood . Not angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I had on her black satin petticoat with matching ribbons over a red crinoline to hold it out full . This was my " slutty " look and I was fully aroused and enjoying the sounds and feel of the fabrics as I wiggled my ass in front of her mirror . I was speechless . Caught in the act ! . A full and pulsing erection , naked except for her petticoats and the contents of her lingerie drawers scattered across the bed . And the woman I secretly lusted for taking it all in . Without saying a word , she unbuckled her trench coat and took it off . She had anticipated this situation , I quickly understood , as I looked at her " attire " . She had on a red satin demi bra , fastened tightly enough to nestle her small but firm breasts nicely at the top of the lace trim . Her nipples were erect and peeked pinkly from beneath the lace . Her waist was snugged a good 3 " smaller than I remembered by a 18 " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin garters with metal fasteners went down to the welts of her black stockings and held them in place on her creamy thighs . Her 4 " spike heels seemed to be miles high as I looked speechless on the beautiful lingerie adorning her body . She entered the room and smoothly pulled on a shorter black satin full petticoat and spun slowly around giving me a good look at her from all sides . <p> " You like ? " she said . I still could not talk . She then added , " I think you do . And I know that you have been doing this for some time . Now it is time to pay me for the pleasure . Follow me to the extra bedroom ; you have some learning to do . " Thus began about three years of satin pleasure as she taught me the wonders of femininity and all it 's trappings . She taught me to dress and play many roles for her , which I willingly did . It even got to the point where she invited some other neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out who else in the neighborhood had a fantasy side like her . It was impossible to look at the mothers of my friends the same way after that . But it sure was more enjoyable . Finally , she initiated me into full service as a woman , which after much anxiety , I found I very much enjoyed " controlling " another through clever visual stimulation and oral handling of the " little head " . I wish I could return to those days . <p> JUDY <p> My first time was in the fifties . I had started dressing in my older sister 's clothes already . But she did n't have any petticoats yet . As I recall , in 1952 -1953 , when I really started dressing up , girl 's fashions were sweaters and quite long , mid-calf length " tight " skirts . This left me with straight half slips , garter belts , etc. to practice on , but un-petticoated full skirts at best ! As the fifties progressed petticoats began to hit the fashion scene . My sister ignored the fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoat support ! How crude ! It must have been in 1954 my sister was graduating from high school . She got a really pretty pink party dress ( for her high school graduation ) that had little baby doll puffed sleeves and an extremely full gathered skirt . Finally she had done it ! The dress had an attached petticoat . As I recall it was a quite pretty one , with two skirts , both gathered at the hem for a nice flounce effect . The edge of the hem was nicely done up with pink satin piping , and there were some little pink satin bows on the flounce . <p> When I saw that dress , I knew I was going to wear it at some point . I got my chance , one afternoon when no one was at home , and was practically hyperventilating as I started dressing . My sister had also gotten some really pretty satin lingerie from our aunt as a graduation gift , and so that was the source of my panties , bra , garter belt and stockings ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin slip that matched the ( my ! ) panties . It felt great sliding over my head and down around my legs . ( I know I did n't need the slip , what with the petticoats I was going to be wearing . I just happed to also love slips ! ) . I felt as if I might faint as I just stood there , my hands against my thighs , pressing against the silk of my slip and panties . Christ , this was wonderful ! I put on my shoes --- a pair of patent leather T-straps , and kept thinking about the final item I was going to dress in . It was great that I could put off doing the dress itself until the end . That way , my mood just kept getting more and more feminine and intense . <p> The anticipation of the petticoats was unbearable ! <p> Finally , I picked up the dress , lifted the skirt and petticoats , and slipped it over my head . I reached into the armholes , slid my arms through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to my waist , and pouffed the skirt over the petticoats . What can I say ? It was superb ! I remember looking at myself in the mirror . I just stood there , more or less wide eyed , and kept doing little things I considered girlish with my skirts . This more or less involved doing things to show off my petticoats , and to a lesser extent , the silk slip , panties , and gartered nylons beneath . <p> Well , I never stopped doing petticoats after that --- not until I became involved in a permanent relationship with a very nice lady who does n't understand this petticoat thing . So that is my story about my first petticoating . What is yours ? <p> Editorial comment by Tessy : <p> Of course , like most of our sisters , I relate strongly to your experience ; matter of fact , I have had similar such experience . In hard times , I fall back on those wonderful memories . <p> But the intriguing thought , as I pulled that dress over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting it must have been to take that for granted , as a girl : the femininity , the beauty , the cuteness . Did they really ( do they really ) appreciate what they have ? I mean , really ? Certainly never the way WE do ! If we were girls , would we loose that ? Maybe we , as physical males , only have that appreciation . The only woman that I know that has those same feelings is Dolly Parton . How do I know ? Because she said so ! Makes no bones about . She said that if she were a male , she would be a female impersonator ! <p> " KERIAN " <p> Unlike most others who have posted their experiences at Petticoat Pond I did not have any childhood experiences with petticoats or any other feminine things . I was an only child and so did not have any sister 's wardrobe to raid for things . I really do n't think I would have had much inclination as a child to wear feminine things anyway . My odyssey into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I began square dancing in 1993 , and I have to admit that one of the things I liked about it was the beautiful outfits the women wore , including all of the petticoats . I have always liked the frilly old time outfits that women used to wear , but in square dancing , I probably stumbled into the last place on earth where such dress is commonplace . After I completed square dance lessons in 1994 , we had a graduation ceremony with an initiation . The initiation activities consisted of having the students dance in various awkward ways . One of the things the club did was to pick four each of the male students and four of the female students and have them dance the opposite part . Not all of the students were subjected to this , but I was . What we did was have a square of all men where the students danced the opposite part and the club members danced the regular man 's part and a square of all women which danced the same fashion . Then the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to the effect of " Just so our student guys will really know they are girls will some of you ladies share their petticoats with them . " I was handed a petticoat and someone had to help me on with it since I did not have the slightest idea of what to do with it . All of us who had to wear these things slipped them over our trousers . Then the caller called a short tip which was a mess , since the student dancers who had to dance the opposite part did not have the slightest idea of what to do . I made it through that experience but it was harrowing for me . I had a pretty tight and very shy personality at the time and if someone had told me at the beginning of square dance lessons that I would have to wear a petticoat to graduate I think I would have quit lessons . If I had known on graduation night that I would be chosen as one of the students to dance the opposite part and wear a petticoat I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that experience , but to be honest I do not even remember what the petticoat felt like because I was too embarrassed at the time . <p> By the way square dancing is really fun , and I expect it to be an important part of my life for the rest of my life . You will not meet a better , more friendly group of people anywhere than in square dancing . Now on to my first voluntary experience with petticoats : Having danced for a few years surrounded by a sea of petticoats , I decided several months ago that it would be an interesting gag to go to a dance cross dressed , which I had never done before , or even really had the inclination to do . Since the only woman square dancer who had clothes big enough to fit me had moved away recently I could not borrow the clothes and I had to buy an outfit . The lady at the local square dance shop , who was a friend of mine , was very helpful and , to save me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cheap price . I had a female friend of mine agree to go to the dance with me and we would both dress and dance the opposite parts . The place we chose to dance was out of town and we went there because the caller was a friend of mine and also because I had dated a girl who used to dance there . The dancers knew me , and since I had dated this girl there they knew I was not gay and would probably accept the way I was dressed as a gag , which it was . I did not really intend to become a cross dresser . We took my friend 's truck and , since there was not any extra room in the cab , I had to wear my outfit all the way to the dance . I not only had the skirt , blouse and petticoat , but appropriate lingerie and a wig . I was not trying to pass myself off actually as a woman so , I went no farther than that in fixing myself up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had been interested in doing that . When we got to the dance , my friend went to change clothes from her work clothes into jeans and a shirt so she would look something like a guy . I stood in the parking lot and realized that the moment of truth had arrived . I was really uncomfortable . My male ego was screaming at me not to go in to the dance . If I had had anything with me to change into I would have done it and blown off our original plan . However , because my friend 's truck was so small , I did not have anything else to wear . I was really stuck . It was either go through with the plan or go home . I did not think it would be fair to my friend to make her go home since she had been kind enough to agree to be my partner for this dance , so I took a deep breath and went in . Everyone recognized me immediately since underneath all of the clothes and the wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started laughing , and I knew then it would be ok . The caller was rolling on the floor and , when I spoke to him on the phone a few days after the dance , he suggested that I come again to dance cross dressed . My friend took a long time to get changed , so I had to dance the first tip as a man , since there was another woman without a partner and we were needed to fill out a square . I felt ridiculous dancing the man 's part cross dressed , since it was not what I had in mind to do when I came . After the first tip , I danced with my partner in the girl 's position the rest of the night and it was wonderful . After I lost my self consciousness I noticed how nice the clothes , and especially petticoat , felt on me . I did not want to admit it but I was hooked . I now own four petticoats and about 6 square dance blouses and 6 skirts , with an assortment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with now is that I would like go dance again cross dressed , but if but I do it on more than a rare occasion , I would get a bad reputation in square dancing . While square dancers are friendly , they are also quite conservative ( which I also am , so I respect their views ) . I danced at that particular club because I knew they would accept it and I would not dream of trying to dance cross dressed most places , as it simply would upset a lot of people . So far the experience I have related is my only cross dressing dance experience . I will probably not venture to do it again until there is a costume dance in my area . Since I can not dance crossed dressed very often , I have a few friends , ( mostly women square dancers ) who I dress up for . To get my dance fix , I have them twirl me occasionally , and it really feels nice . All of you other poufbunnies have n't lived until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , I think that each and every one of them would look forward to being flared out when the person wearing them was twirled , as that is what they are made for . If any of you poufbunnies reading this are male square dancers anxious to repeat my gag , please be very careful how you go about doing it . Even though the group I went to as a whole really enjoyed it , there were one or two minor problems , such as one of the dancers there who did not know me asking if I was gay . Now all I need is a wife who enjoys dressing me up . I am still single , but looking . <p> LENNAE <p> My Aunt was a seamstress . She always made clothes for the various members of Our family . She made shirts and pants and shorts for the boys , and tops , skirts and dresses for the girls . She lived only two doors away , and was a constant part of my life . <p> It seemed to start very innocently for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I could come over to help out Auntie ' R ' for a half-hour or so with some sewing . She was trying to hem a skirt and needed me to stand up very straight with the skirt on so she could pin the hem to make it even . Since I was n't doing anything of importance , I went right over and supplied the ' body ' for her . I felt a little embarrassed but she allowed me to have my pants on under the skirt since the waist was a little larger than mine ... all I had to do was pull up my pant legs and stand there while she pinned away . I was done in a jiffy . She told me I made a good model and she asked if I could help out next week with another project . I agreed to do so . <p> The following week I went over again to help her out with a little girl 's dress she was making for her niece who lived in another town . I was really excited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to put the dress on so she could make the necessary adjustments . It was basically a pink dress with lots of ruffles and white lace . I fell in love with this dress and I was really sad when she finished all her work . It was to be a gift . I helped out with at least four fittings ; the final fitting was a full dress ' viewing ' with my mother and some other neighborhood ladies present ! Besides wearing the dress and petticoat , I was asked ( directed ) by both my aunt and mother to put on white tights , complete with little ruffled socks and pink shoes with straps and little girl bows on the toes . I was assisted by both of them with this task , as I had never put on tights and shoes like this before . Everyone loved the little dress and gave their approval and I could hear them comment to each other about how cute I looked ... " I made a cute little girl " they all said . But I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my aunt make me my own dress like this , I somehow knew it would never happen . <p> Well , I was now appointed to be Auntie ' R 's ' fitting model for her nieces . I took part in many dress and skirt creations . I was in heaven . Eventually I grew and was no longer the correct size for my cousins . ( I called them cousins even though they were really not directly related ) . The modeling did n't stop however ; as I grew to the size of ... you guessed it ! ! ... Auntie ' R ' herself ! ! I continued to do this for another year and a half or so . Many of the final ' viewings ' were done completely dressed in my aunt 's clothes , and I mean completely . I think , in fact I know , that she knew I really enjoyed wearing pretty girls ' clothes . I would show off her clothes that she had just made wearing everything female from head to foot . I got to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into to give the appearance of breasts , along with her garter belt and stockings that she had to show me how to put on and attach . Over that went some silky little panties and then the dress . The petticoat went on last , as it was pulled up under the dress . Last but not least , I got to wear her high heels , which were rather hard for me to walk in . They were sandal type with lots of straps . I loved every minute of it . <p> I was always trying on other items as well , to see what ' went ' with what . Different tops , skirts , slips ... different shades of stockings and different styles and types of shoes . It was wonderful . <p> I was still growing , however , not necessarily getting bigger but nonetheless ' maturing ' . My last dressing up with her was perhaps the most embarrassing moment for me and probably the most influential experience of my life . I was probably about 12 and a half or so by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total heaven as she frilled about me sewing this and that and trying out this belt with this necklace . She even tried out several shades of lipstick on my lips to see if the colors matched correctly . We had already tried several shades of nylons and at least four pairs of shoes when she got out of her drawer a new package of what looked like nylon stockings . She opened the package and took out the garment and handed it to me with a pair of little white gloves . The package was labeled ' Round the Clock - Agilon - a bikini with legs ' . She told me they were pantyhose and that I had to put the gloves on before putting them on so they would not snag and run . She then left the room . My heart was racing as I gathered them and smoothed them over my legs . Now I noticed I had a major problem . Not with the pantyhose , but with a specific body part making it 's first appearance in female clothes . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in heaven because I was dressed totally female again . I was wearing something new - pantyhose . The dress and petticoat really felt great against my totally-covered legs and the high heels added to the feeling all the more . The bulge in my pantyhose would not go away and I was flushed all over . I tried to hide the feelings as I made my way into her sewing room for her approval . It was at this time that this ' specific body part began ' to leak uncontrollably ' in front . ' I told her that I had an accident and soiled her panties and pantyhose . She pulled up the dress and petticoat and saw what had happened . Auntie hugged me and told me it was OK and this was very normal and a beautiful thing because I was becoming a man . She said she loved me very much but she also said we should not do any more fittings again and she hoped I would someday understand why . She went back to her drawer and got out a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told me to change into them and to put on a pair of ' flats . ' We rinsed out the pantyhose and panties and then hung them out to dry . Auntie told me to wait in the living room for her as she went into her bedroom to change . She came out dressed in a similar dress to the one I had on , complete with white tights and flats . Then she grabbed me by the hand . We went for a long walk outside - in public ! ! Everyone must have thought I was a young girl , because they never gave me a second glance . We sat in the park and talked for a long time . Auntie told me that she had always wanted a little girl to frill about . She was n't sorry that she had two very young boys and she thanked me for allowing her to be " her daughter , " if only for a short while . I told her I really enjoyed it and that I really liked some of her clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . We walked around the ' block ' again and then went back home . <p> Several weeks later she stopped over when my mom was n't home and gave me a small package . She thanked me for all the help I was to her . Little did she know that I loved every minute of being dressed up as a girl ... or did she ? I later opened the package to find a new pair of pantyhose and and the powder blue slip with white lace and matching panties I always admired . <p> LIESEL SIOBHAN <p> I must have been about 5 because it was just after we moved and I started kindergarten the fall after we moved . My grandmother kept a large doll on a chair in the bedroom . One afternoon while we were at my grandparents house I was wandering around the house and ended up in the bedroom looking at the doll . I do n't remember why , but I decided to try on the doll 's dress . I was small , the dress was a little tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I do remember the dress felt very nice and I was quite excited about having it on and I went to the living room to show everyone . I think they were a little shocked at first but then I got some hugs and was told that I was a very cute little girl . Then I was asked to put the dress back on the doll so nothing would happen to it . After that I did n't dress up again until I was ten . <p> In the between years , I always noticed what the girls were wearing . The girls I knew wore dresses with full skirts and petticoats . When my Mom went shopping I loved having the chance to touch some of the soft and fluffy things . I spent hours looking through catalogs trying to imagine how it would feel to dress up in all the wonderful things I saw there . No one ever taught or encouraged me to dress up . We lived in the country and I got to spend lots of time by myself . Where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was n't needed or did n't fit anymore it was put aside in a box , or bag . The closest family had three girls . I was offered the chance to play dress ups several times , but I always declined . I was always very self conscious about the fact that I really wanted to dress up . I thought if anyone saw me dressed up they would be able to tell how much I liked it and then I would get teased a lot . One summer I decided to try on some panties . I was real excited and a little scared , but I was rewarded with the most marvelous experience I ever had to that point . From then on I started collecting and experimenting with girl 's clothes . I did not want to steal so I would make secret trades of something from our old things for something from a neighbor 's box of old things . As I tried on various things I found that the little girl 's cotton lingerie was n't nearly as much fun to wear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters . As I explored around to see what wonderful girl things I could find mostly I came across panties and slips . I kept searching though because what I really wanted , what I hoped so much to find was a Petticoat ! <p> One day a new box appeared . When I saw it I was very excited and could hardly wait until no one was around so I could look in it . Later that day I opened the box and started looking through it . About halfway down in the box I touched something very soft ! I remember I got a shiver as I pulled it out . I was holding a short black velvet skirt and it was poufed up ! As I looked it over , to my joy , I found that it had its own petticoat and panties . I almost got undressed to try it on right then , but luckily I stopped to think and remembered that I was n't alone . I found a temporary hiding place for my new treasure and went on with other things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was SO ! excited about having such a special skirt . The next day I had time to myself . When I went to get my precious new skirt I found the box was gone . I panicked a little , but I found the petticoated skirt where I left it . I ran so I could get ready to try on my new petticoated skirt . I had always been aware that the girls kept themselves very clean and thought I should be clean too whenever I was going to dress up so the first thing I did was take a bath and powered myself . When I was done I thought about the skirt having its own panties , but decided it would be best to put on a regular pair of panties before I put on the skirt . I remember that as I put on the panties I was shivering from being excited and scared all at once . As I stepped into the skirt I pulled it up ever so slowly . I wanted to enjoy every moment of ACTUALLY PUTTING IT ON ! , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . I expected that this very special petticoated skirt would actually turn me into a girl if I was n't careful . I was in a state of rapture from how wonderful it was to be wearing that little petticoated skirt . I just could n't believe anything could be that WONDERFUL ! I stood there a long time twisting back and forth gently with the petticoat and skirt twirling softly around my legs . I noticed Everything ! A slight breeze around my legs as the petticoats caressed and tickled my legs . The skirt pulling the petticoat out then wrapping it around me . A sweet smell that came in a breeze as I twirled . When I woke from my little trance I played ! I spun around fast to make my petticoat go out straight . I sat down and jumped up , ran around , jumped , ran up and down the stairs , and went to the mirror to see what I looked like . The thought occurred to me , as I held up my skirt so I could see my petticoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way ! <p> I did n't turn into a girl and that was good because I was happy being a boy . I just happened to love being a girl too ! Still for a long time I thought that petticoats would turn me into a girl if I was n't careful . I figured that either it was a secret that girl 's clothes were magic and I was n't supposed to know about it or I was the only one that knew about it . Either way I decided I 'd better keep it real secret because I knew I would get picked on a lot if anyone found out . That did n't stop me though I just loved the feel of being dressed up and I liked the way I looked when I was dressed up . <p> Petticoats never did turn me into a girl , but they sure did bring out the girl in me . <p> PEEKUP <p> I do n't know exactly when I first became attracted to crinolines . I do know that by fifth or sixth grade I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' skirts in my class . This was reinforced when my parents moved into a house in which my second floor bedroom window overlooked the local school playground . From seventh grade on for the next couple of years I would come home and go up to the window and watch the girls that had stayed after school to play on the playground equipment , swings , sliding board , sea-saw , and a jungle-gym . This was in the late ' 50 's and I was most attracted to the ones wearing the fullest skirts and the most petticoats . Eventually I even talked my dad into letting me keep his binoculars up stairs so that I could watch the " birds " . I do n't think he ever did figure out my true motive . All this watching fueled a desire for some crinolines of my own . I was fortunate here because I also had an older sister who had just what I wanted . The challenge was to get to them when she was n't around . The fear of getting caught along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on is feeling that only another crinoline fan can fully appreciate . Our house had a large fan mounted up stairs so that when it was turned on a strong draft was created in the stairway between the first and second floors . I used to love to race down the stairs wearing my sisters crinolines letting them billow wildly in the breeze . I continued until I finally got caught , but that story is for another topic like " So They Caught You ! " <p> REBECCA <p> I first became aware of petticoats in the mid 1950 's while in middle school . Our school , in Southern Texas went from the 4th through 8th grades . I was in the early stages of learning and discovering myself , and trying to grasp onto this force that instinctively drew me to the clothing of girls of my peer group . I was so fascinated with the colors , the sounds , the softness and fullness of petticoats , that I took every opportunity to gaze at , dream about and walk closely by girls who wore these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net and lace . Just a chance opportunity to brush past one of these full skirted girls , listening to the crush of taffeta against net , would make my day . To slyly gaze up the stairway as I slowly walked to the second floor of the school building would expose my eyes to so many lovely sets of petticoats , and then when entering the class room , again to view these lovely girls all sitting with their full shirts pushed out toward the isle so that they could squeeze into their single seat school desk , would again expose all the beauty of each girls beautiful set of petticoats . It was a wonderful time in my life . <p> Being a single child and living with my grandparents , I really had no opportunity to experience petticoats at home . I did have many friends who had sisters . These girls , being conscious of the current fashion trends of the mid 50 's all had petticoats . No two sets of petticoats were the same . As petticoats began their fashion run with the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have progressively gotten larger ( and heavier ) . I overheard girls talking about going to San Antonio to get these , or such and such . It became quite the fashion for at least one full school year . The sets I was able to examine , seemed to have a minimum of 6 to 8 different petticoats all worn together . Colors were mixed , for the most part being light pastels and shades of white . Lace edging were on many of them . Riding my bicycle down the street I would often see petticoats spread out on porches or patios drying . Of course it was necessary to wash and starch your petticoats or the crispness and fullness would soon disappear . I suspect some girls added a new set more often than they washed and starched the old sets . Many of these young ladies carried a heaviness on their hips , with 5 or 6 sets of petticoats hanging on them for a full school day . <p> My first experience of actually trying on petticoats came one afternoon shortly after lunch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do boys in middle school do with wasted afternoons ? As usual , I walked into his house , no one locked or even closed their doors in our town , in the 1950 's unless you were leaving for vacation ! Finding no one around , I walked through the house ending up in the living room at the opposite end of the house . There , on the floor , was a huge mound of petticoats , sitting just as someone had stepped out of them . I was so overwhelmed , I had to sit down . I remember that the window air conditioner was running and I peeked down the hallway , listening for any noise of returning friends . Not hearing or seeing anyone , I quickly striped off my Levi 's and jumped into the circle of nylon , lace and net , pulling the whole set onto my hips and up to my waist . The aroma of perfume and the feel of the nylon and net against my body so overwhelmed me physically , that I fell to the carpet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of actually having these beautiful petticoats upon my body left me in somewhat of a state of shock ! I regained my senses and became frightened that someone would return and see me , quickly stepped back out of them and into my Levi 's . <p> Since that day , petticoats have been one of my everlasting loves . Need I say more ? <p> STAR <p> My mom started dressing me up at Halloween as a girl when I was about 7 or 8 yrs . old . I 'll always remember that first dress ... taffeta ( very full with layers and gathers ) , a red satin square dancing style petticoat , wig and makeup . Then in the mirror , I was surprised to see myself as a really cute girl . It was my Mom 's dress ( she was short ) -but still probably knee length on her--ending up like a bride maids tea length dress on me . <p> My best friend across the street was also dressed like a girl---I guess our Mom 's got together on this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since my best friend was getting dressed like one , I decided to go along . This was my very first experience wearing girls clothing ! I remember walking around the neighborhood all dressed up , it was a cool night , and the taffeta seemed extra " shimmery " against my skin . <p> As I walked around the neighborhood , I started to like the way the dress and petticoat swished as I walked . It felt really nice against my legs--and became fun to swish my dress back and forth as I walked . Towards the end of the street , we ran into some " real girls " from the neighborhood ... and I got real nervous . My heart started beating fast ! Would they recognize us ? What would they think ? And would n't you know it--the three of them came right up to us ! They did n't take long to figure out who we were ... and then they started fussing over us . " Oh you look soooo cute , who dressed you ... etc . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I was were wearing underneath ! That was embarrassing . I just started liking girls ... and never got attention from them before . Boy did I get attention that night ! It was great ! Obviously , I never forgot it . <p> My Mom dressed me like that again the following year , ( per my request because I liked the way it felt when I walked ) . The third year she dressed me in a little girls party dress and petticoat . It fit me perfectly ! I 'm not sure where she got it from ... I did n't ask . I remember my Dad saying to my Mom when I got home ... enough is enough with the girl costumes ... that was the last year for awhile . Too late - I was hooked . I would sneak the dresses and petticoats when nobody was home . A few years later , while wearing a taffeta dress and petticoat , the swishing stimulated me for my first " hard time " . Only the beginning ....... <p> SYLVIA NICOLE <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger than my sister , who also graduated in ' 54 . The earliest I can remember is at the age of six or seven when I would sneak into my sister 's closet and slide up inside a formal skirt that had a net skirt over a taffeta underskirt . I had only a few minutes to take in the exquisite pleasure of the sound and feel of taffeta against my skin . On the very rarest occasions was I able to take it off the hanger and try it on . The stimulation of taffeta against my naked skin was , and still is , beyond compare to anything I have experienced in terms of sensual pleasure . Why I went in her closet , I have no idea . ( I realize this is the first time , but the latter reflects the sum total of my dressing between ages of 5/6 and 18 . ) In about third grade I remember my sister had a slip that was made of crinoline material . I knew the material because I had asked my mother what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room to stroke the material while it was laying there waiting to be ironed . I remember my mother asking why I wanted to know . That Christmas or maybe the following Christmas I came across a pink taffeta petticoat and a red crinoline petticoat laying on the box that was used to store Christmas decorations . I took frequent trips to the basement just to stroke and nuzzle my face in the materials . After a few weeks of the petticoats not being moved , I snuck them upstairs to my room and hid them in my clsoet . Now I could relish the wearing of them . I took them with me whenever I went to visit my aunt and uncle 's farm . Wearing them underneath my jeans and shirt I would go out to the pasture and , after removing my jeans , I would parade around , enjoying the double petticoats brushing across my legs . In ' 55 , my mother cleaned my closet , throwing the petticoats away . Though she never said anything , she did refer to a psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one to tell me that I was not the only boy in the world to dress up in girls clothes . I also learned the term " transvestism . " As for the petticoats , I have yet to find duplicates . In the last two ears of my sister 's high school years , she had a party dress that had a black wool top and a striped taffeta skirt . With easier access to my sister 's closet , I was able to wear the dress and my two petticoats and felt absolutely wonderful . One other frequent occurrence when I was in grade school was the Kresge store in my hometown . When entering the store , three sides of a rectangle counter were covered with tacked up crinoline petticoats . Every time I would walk in , I would walk around the counter just to brush my hand across the petticoats . It killed me not to have money in which to purchase one more of them . The petticoats of the 50 's were my passion and my life ; they also were my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found only one person who would have said " It 's okay ; you are not alone " when I was in grade school . Unfortunately there was n't , and I lived for a decades with the fear of being caught " with my petticoats exposed . " Is it any wonder I am a late night person and probably the fastest strip artist in my part of the state ? <p> ANONYMOUS <p> It all started innocently enough . Tim was a local neighborhood friend who was pretty cool to hang around with . As our friendship grew tighter , I started staying the night with his family more often . One of the first things I noticed about his family was that his mother was an exceptionally good looking woman . One time when I was over , she sat with us in the living room , watching the T.V. , and she started folding laundry . When she folded her panties , which were a lavender purple color and a satiny shine , I almost had a heart attack . <p> Eventually she moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I helped them move out . Susan herself handed me the underwear drawer , her underwear . I saw nylon panties , shiny bras , a purple polyester tap pant , and what I thought at that time , a big fluffy black slip . I thought about her clothes all night . <p> I would dress up in her clothes whenever I could . I could n't wear her camisoles or bras , I was a growing teenager and her upper body was smaller than mine . Fortunately her panties , slips , and a few nightgowns fit me . I 'll never forget the night that his mother had gone out of town and I would have to sleep in her room . When he went to sleep , only his grandmother stayed awake , and she was hard of hearing . She was in the living room watching the T.V. Susan had a dimmer light in her room , so you could adjust the light , and I turned this up enough to be barely seen . I crept over to her dresser to see all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put on four pairs of satin hipster style panties , one nylon , and three of her nylon briefs . I slid into a black half slip , then a white nylon slip , and over it all I wore the most divine creation the world has ever known : I slid into her black petticoat . With it 's loose yards of fabric flowing over my body , it sent electric charges to my brain . I played in her clothes for three hours , I always came back to her petticoat . It was so beautiful , it made me feel beautiful , and I would whimper in girlish delight at the experience of wearing Susan 's black petticoat . <p> It started becoming an obsession for me shortly thereafter . I started finding more and more clever ways to wear her clothes . This also led to more more chances of getting caught . One time , she returned home early , and I had it all on . I had to throw her underwear in the drawer as they came off my body , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noticed overlapping each other . Some of the silly things I did was take her clothes to my room , put them on in the laundry room while the others were bathing , and put them on in her room while the others were bathing , I was always finding ways to get closer to her clothes . I loved pretending that I was Susan , and I loved twirling in that petticoat . It was so feminine , I was as pretty as a girl in her clothes . <p> One time I was watching T.V. in Susan 's room . My friend came to me and announced that he was going to take a bath . The bathroom is about five feet from her room , but I was n't going to let this stop me from feeling pretty . I knew the risks , as I dropped my pants and reached for her panty drawer . I could n't resist the temptation to grab her panties , feel them , put them on . By now I knew everything she had--I had a certain order I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was putting on the third pair of satin panty when I heard the bathroom door open and footsteps . Quickly I slid into my jeans , over the panties , hiding my underwear in her drawer , but I had to leave the drawer open . He came in and joked around while the tub filled . Internally I had died a thousand times . I was wearing his mother 's panties . <p> He never noticed the drawer , and eventually he went back to the bath . I was out of control by this time . You see , I had worn her clothes so often that I felt like I was part owner of them . I had fantasies about telling her this and announcing to her that I would wear her clothes any time I came over . I felt I had a right to her clothes . I put on everything , but I slid her petticoat on last . I started twirling around to watch it fly up . Then the door flew open . In walked Tim 's sister and his female cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's underwear . My heart sank , I had been caught . Sheepishly I grabbed my clothes and walked out of her room .

Personally , especially as I reflect upon my first petticoat experience , wearing a crinoline beneath a dress necessitates the wearing of several other garments in order to complete the transformation . Vintage bustiers and corsets provide the required figure control to accentuate our waists and torsos , add a little texture to the rich vintage fabrics of these feminine dresses , and provide a narrow and defined starting point from which your crinoline may cascade downward . When one is wearing vintage foundation garments beneath beautiful dresses , stockings must be worn in order to retain the integrity of the silhouette ; pantyhose waistbands are cumbersome in this lingerie configuration . Finally , and whether or not a more constrictive basque or bustier is worn overtop of the first foundation garment , after the wearer steps into the crinoline combination and sets the garments in place around reduced waist regions , no experience is more spinetingling or satisfying than feeling that slippery vintage dress fabric glide across your torso and come to rest across the expanse of petticoat material spread beneath it . The cumulative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right dress and shoes , as well as correctly applied makeup , explains the obssessive component of wearing crinolines . When this total transformation occurs , whether in the privacy of your own home , at a transformation salon , or at a party or gathering , the wearer experiences a dimension of feminine helplessness , and magical things can happen . At the very least , everyone who observes is instantaneously aware that you are wearing at least one crinoline , and this is before you even attempt to sit or ascend a staircase . When in close quarters with those around you , the extent and degree of your illusion also becomes clearly obvious , the lines of heavily-boned foundation garments appearing through the fabric of your dress , the rich and sometimes musty aroma of vintage garments tickles their noses , and the mysterious and alluring noises created by crinoline materials brushing against stockinged legs and rustling dress fabrics , alerts everyone to your secret .

It appeared magical to have a wonderful , perfumed young woman sitting next to me spreading her full dress and rustling underthings against my knees ( boys wore short trousers in those days ) . I used to feel the scratchiness of the stiff nylon netting on my skin through her cotton dresses as she made herself comfortable . <p> At around the same time , the girls in the village school started to wear wide skirts and petticoats .

My aunt had two daughters named Amanda and Katie . Both were in their middle teens , while I was a few years younger . I really got on well with my cousins , although they seemed much more worldly and more adult than me . <p> My room was at the end of a corridor . One morning , I remember waking up quite late to find both cousins in my room . My aunt had left earlier to play golf . They were both wearing the usual teenage sleeveless blouses with wide cotton circular plaid skirts , gathered at the waist over layers and layers of stiff tiered nylon net petticoats , which rustled and swayed as they walked about . They both wore American-tan coloured nylon stockings held up by frilly white suspender belts . <p> They both sat on my bed in their wide full skirts , their knees bent across my legs , and asked me whether I had a girlfriend . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seemed to provoke an unexpected reaction . <p> Immediately , they teasingly grabbed me by the hair and arms and pulled me off the bed and held me firmly down on the bedroom carpet , face up . Amanda said they would both take turns to sit on my face and smother me under their skirts if I did n't  apologise . I said that I would " never , in a million years " . She then stepped over me and lowered herself so that both her knees caressed my ears . I stared up at her thighs , her nylon stockings , and at her frilly white panties which were within inches of my face . She was holding her white nylon net petticoats and plaid skirt above me so that she could see the expression on my face . <p> " Say sorry , toe-rag " said Amanda . I said " no way , get lost , " and then everything went dark . Amanda sat on me and dropped her skirt and petticoats over my face , blocking out the light . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with her lace-trimmed white panties firmly pushed into my nose so I could hardly breathe . It was surprisingly dark under my cousins skirt and petticoats , and I could hardly hear her speak , or any other sound under the many layers of nylon and plaid which covered me . <p> After several minutes Amanda lifted her bottom off my face slightly then draped her perfumed petticoats over my cheeks , chin and mouth and rubbed the scratchy nylon net over my face many times until I was forced to say " sorry . " The froufrou noise against my face and ears , as petticoat layer slid against petticoat layer , was almost deafening . She seemed to take a delight in dragging the multi-layered , almost transparent , nylon lacy net over my facial features as if I was drowning in a sea of petticoats . She continued draping and dragging her stiff petticoat hems over my face over and over again , concentrating on my nose , mouth and ears . The excitement inside of me was almost unbearable . Amanda got off me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . <p> My pleadings did n't  seem to stop what was about to happen next . They both pulled me onto the middle of the floor spreadeagled and stood over me , their nylon-clad feet moving over my nose , mouth , ears and hair . <p> " Say you are really sorry David , or well really squash you this time . " Katie stood up and spread her skirts over me , I looked up to see her pink panties descending onto my upturned face under layer after layer of petticoat . She was wearing a dark blue skirt which seemed to contrast well with the starchy whiteness of her underthings . Again everything went dark and I did n't  know what to do . Clearly saying sorry had got me nowhere , so I was resigned to whatever was expected of me , having my head trapped under the many layers of Wendys net petticoats and lacy , frilly underskirts . Katie was clearly intent in keeping me hidden under her wide circular skirt and stiff net petticoats for longer than her sister . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear was the swishing and crackling of her petticoats moving over and above me . Sometimes she lifted her bottom and I was able to breathe slightly - then , everything went dark again . The lace trim of the many multi-tiered- layers were quite scratchy and uncomfortable , particularly as she did n't  seem to be able to keep her bottom still . <p> Eventually , Katie got off me and stood up with her feet to either side of my face , Her sister walked over and stood over me too . Both their skirts touched and I was treated to a view of a lifetime : Layer upon layer of scratchy stiff nylon net edged with ribbon or leader line . This framed glimpses of panty , suspender belt and stocking tops . For a young impressionable boy this was as close to heaven as you could get . <p> Suddenly , we heard my aunts car return and my cousins ran downstairs . I was left in a state of confusion , and hurriedly got dressed , wondering what the rest of the stay with my cousins would bring .

She talked me into putting on knee socks and her Sunday shoes ( Mary Janes ) too . I felt so strange with the skirt and petticoats brushing my legs , and the shiny black shoes were so cold . At her urging , I began swishing around , acting overly feminine and trying to speak in a prissy voice .

She was a very pretty blonde-haired woman who dressed very smartly in the latest fashions . It was the dresses that she wore which particularly attracted me , for in the 1950s women tended to dress in pretty and very full shirt-waister dresses and skirts with cinched waists , supported by multi-layered bouffant petticoats . I noticed with excitement how Pennys skirts swayed when she walked , how the hem would lift to reveal layers of white lace , so exquisitely feminine , and how the different layers of skirt and petticoat rustled . I also noticed the faint wafts of her perfume which also made my head spin and gave me a strange feeling which I had n't  experienced before .

I could not take my eyes off her and her clothes and I am sure she must have been aware of my interest , excitement and closeness to her . She was not yet aware , I am sure , of my yearning to see , hear , touch and smell her most intimate garments alone . <p> There were times when I could indulge my pleasures for female clothing , especially when my Mother or I persuaded Penny to stay a while and sit down to talk .

I remember becoming light-headed and immensely excited at the thought of perhaps one day being able to get close to and touch her bouffant petticoats . Perhaps one day my dreams would come true , but I could n't see how that could happen . <p> The years passed and I was able to occasionally indulge some of my pleasures when I found my mothers slips and petticoats in the airing cupboard and I was able to sneak a passing touch .

The occasional glimpse of lace ribbon hems and net was enough to sustain me through the day . I saw older women in the streets as they walked around , with swinging hips lifting their skirt hems to reveal masses of lace which could only be the hems of bouffant petticoats underneath .

This involved feeding it once a day during the morning when I was at school . On this particular day , my Mother got a phone call at 8 oclock from a friend who said she had been going up to town for the day shopping with a friend but the friend had had to drop out at the last minute and would my Mother like to go .

I slipped on a tracksuit and armed with the Pennys back door key , went to feed the cat , knowing that I was really going there for another reason altogether . I had been dreaming of seeing for myself , the awesome array of skirts and petticoats which I knew Penny must have and the time had come . The thought of it made me breathless and light headed .

Here they were in all their glory . <p> What self control I had disappeared when I saw these lovely underthings and I tore off my clothes in a frenzy of excitement and , in a breathless and highly uncontrolled state , went to the wardrobe and took the petticoats off their hangers one by one , rubbing them in turn against my body and feeling the exquisite texture of all the material .

I drew it to my face a rubbed it against me , sending tingles through my entire body . I could stand it no longer . I placed all these bouffant petticoats on the floor and fell squirming into them .

It fell to the waist and I was adorned as I felt I also should have been . I smoothed it down carefully and noticed that it had its own underskirt of 2 layers of blue net . The bouffant petticoat was slightly longer , so half an inch of delicate lace appeared at the hem , exciting me beyond measure as I spun and twirled , watching the hem lift and the seeing the intimate revelations below .

Although I did n't  know it , for the next 3 hours , I paraded in front of the mirror trying all the combinations I could imagine . I tried on some of Pennys satin knickers in pink , blue and black , a suspender belt and stockings , and I dressed up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I even cinched my waist with a belt . I taught myself to walk without throwing the skirt hem too high , but enough to give a glimpse of petticoat lace , as Penny was able to do , and I learnt to sit on a chair in front of the mirror , without showing too much petticoat . I have to admit there were moments when in sheer delight , I would let the skirt hem ride up , so that I could indulge myself in the sheer delight of petticoat gazing and feast on the layer upon layer of curvaceous frilly hems . I twirled and twirled until I was dizzy , all the time gazing in rapture at the feminine clothes and underclothes in which I was adorned . <p> The time sped passed , without me noticing , as I remained in a high state of excited bliss . I did not hear the back door go . It was only when my Mother called up the stairs to see if I was there that I froze . " I thought I heard a water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carefully and then come home " , she said . What panic and relief at the same time , although I secretly felt I would have loved my Mother to see me in all my borrowed finery . As carefully as I could , I folded up the knickers , suspender belt , bra , stockings and beautifully sensuous blue satin petticoat and put them back in the drawer I took them from , and inhaling my favourite pink bouffant petticoat against my nose , said a sad farewell to the skirt and bouffant pettis which I had come to adore over the last few hours . I looked at my watch and I saw I had been there for 5 hours . I rushed down the stairs and back home to my Mother , trying not to show my confusion at the thought of nearly being caught in female underclothes , but secretly aroused by the chance of being found out . <p> Penny and her husband came home a few days later and Penny called in the thank my Mother for feeding the cat . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoat I had frolicked in a few days before . As she walked , she swished about and the hems of her skirts and petticoats appeared to lift more than they usually did . She commented on the chair in the bedroom in front of the mirror and my Mother said that I had fed the cat one day and that I thought I had heard water dripping . It was because of that I had gone upstairs . Penny smiled sweetly at me and thanked me for being so caring , but her look was also querying and I felt myself starting to blush . She gave me a big hug , pressed herself to me , causing her skirts and bouffant petticoats to crush themselves noisily against my body and then she turned sharply , throwing her skirts hems into the air to give me a clear view of her petticoat and she was gone . " What a nice girl " , said my Mother , " and very pretty " . " I saw you looking at her " . I smiled and thought if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I was really doing in her bedroom that day ? Was that why she wore my favourite bouffant petticoat , grabbed me to her , spun round to give me a clear view of her feminine underthings ? Well that is another story . <p> Chapter 2 <p> It was four weeks after my first encounter that my story took another strange turn . My parents one Friday night were summoned to a business evening which was to be a late function , so my Mother spoke to Penny next door , to see whether she could baby-sit , or more accurately , as I was 11 years old , keep an eye on me . Penny said she would and suggested that I should stay over with her , because of the late return of my parents . She said that her husband was away and she would be glad of my company . So , on the appointed evening , I went next door with my toothbrush and overnight bag , with a flush of excitement as I was secretly very fond of Penny and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was very pretty , wore gorgeous smelling perfume and most of all , dressed in the loveliest full circle skirts and flouncy bouffant petticoats underneath . I knew because only 4 weeks earlier , I had worn those skirts and all 5 of her petticoats when I went to feed her dog , while she and her husband were on holiday . I hoped that tonight she would be dressed in one of her circle skirts accompanied by some scrumptious billowing petticoats . I could feel my excitement rising in anticipation as I knocked on her door . <p> Penny opened the door dressed in a pair of trousers and my heart dropped , although she looked very pretty with her hair in a ponytail and a pink lacy bra showing through a flimsy voile blouse . She looked delectable anyway , I told myself . She suggested I take my things up to the guest bedroom and then come down to watch TV . I went up the stairs , passing her bedroom where I had immersed myself in her feminine underthings . I had a secret desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe , but I did not have the courage and dropped off my things in the guest room and returned downstairs . <p> I sat on the sofa and Penny joined me . She was drinking a vodka and tonic and asked whether I would like one . She poured me a glass when I said I would , although I had never tasted vodka before . She hated being alone , she said , so she had already had two drinks . Until then , I had n't  realised her husband had been away for 4 days . <p> The drink warmed me and I relaxed beside the object of my affections . We chatted about what I was doing at school and I felt after a time that Penny was teasing me . She then told me to watch TV as she had to disappear to do something . She would be back in a minute . I watched TV , inhaling her perfume as I sat on the sofa . A few minutes later , Penny came back into the room . I gasped as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening skirt with an obvious frilly bouffant white petticoat peeping from underneath the skirt hem . " Oh , you look beautiful " , I said before I realised what I had said . " Is that a new skirt and petticoat ? " Penny said that it was a new outfit for a dance which she and Mack , her husband , were to attend in a few weeks time . She had put it on to get my reaction . " Your reaction was very positive " , she smiled . What else could I have said ; it was a heavenly skirt , it rustled when she moved and it was heavyweight material so that , as she walked , the skirt hem swished and moved , revealing glimpses of whispery white lace petticoat hem . In a trembling voice , I said it was quite lovely and asked her to give a twirl , which she did allowing the skirt hem to flick up to reveal her stoking tops , a glimpse of pink satin French knickers and a full 6 inches of flounced petticoat hems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I was sitting down on the sofa , my obvious excitement with her appearance . She smiled knowingly and sat down beside me , sweeping her skirts under her . I nearly died from excitement . I was in heaven . The sound of the underskirts was dramatic , the swishing from the taffeta and crackling from the layer of paper nylon . What was even more exciting was the hem of the skirt fell over my lap as she sat down and my hands were suddenly being caressed by masses of lace , taffeta and net . I could hardly control myself and Penny noticed the effect all this was having on me . Suddenly she drew in her breath , laughed , and turning to me said , " Of course , its all clear to me now " . " The chair left in my bedroom when we came back from holiday , in front of the mirror , and your comments about a new petticoat tonight " . " The chair was not there for checking for a water leak , was it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had put on my underwear " . You dressed up in my skirts and petticoats , did n't  you " . " And you knew tonight that the petticoat I am wearing was new because you have seen and dressed up in all my other ones " . " Am I right " , she said , looking straight at me . <p> I was dumbfounded , helpless and embarrassed and I felt tears begin to fill my eyes . She had found out about my deep secret and I there was nothing I could say . She then gave me a big smile and put her arm around me , stroking my hair and drawing me to her . I buried my face in her bosom , smelling her scent and I that calmed my worries to an extent and my embarrassment partially drain away . I stayed like that for maybe a minute before she eased her grip and looking into my eyes , said that I had better tell her the full story about my obviously strange behaviour . <p> I blurted out my life history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . I told her how my Mother had dressed me in her underclothes from as early an age as I could remember , because she had always wanted a daughter . After having me , she was told that she could not have any more children , so the next best thing was to dress me as her daughter , which she had done until I went to school at the age of five . Wearing silk and satin petticoats and lacey silk knickers became synonymous with pleasing my Mother , and I came to love the gently soothing texture of her delicate underclothes , the glistening of the material as they caught the light , the contrast of the layers of lace and the feel of such wonderfully soft frilly things against my skin . When I had to revert to boys clothes , it was something which I could not understand and it left an indelible mark and trauma which I would never get over , but events in my early life had indelibly turned me into a lover of feminine underclothes and the excitement of wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me , more so than anything else . <p> Penny hugged me and said that she thought she fully understood my desires and asked me whether I would like to see the petticoat which she was wearing , laughingly saying that I knew all the others she had hanging in her wardrobe so there was no point showing me them . With that she lifted the hem of the taffeta skirt to reveal the most beautiful petticoat I had ever glimpsed , on top a layer of white patterned satin , in three tiers , with pretty white lace at the hem and pink silk ribbon on the two tiers . It was so pretty , that without realising , I put my hand out and gently stroked this beautiful piece of femininity , gasping in sheer pleasure at its beauty . Penny hugged me and lifted the satin layer to reveal a second and third layer of net , both with lace hems , then she showed me a layer of white taffeta with frothy lace hem , another layer of beribboned net and finally , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave body to the bouffant petticoat and provided the crackling sounds whenever she moved . I was in sheer heaven . I lost control , fell sideways and buried my face in this exquisite underthing , indulging my senses to the full , the smell of the material , the sounds of the crackling and swishing and the different feel of the satin , net and taffeta . Penny did n't  mind and stroked my head fondly . For the first time in 11 years I felt blissfully happy and content as I fell asleep . <p> It must have been an hour later when Penny woke me up and said it was time for us to go to bed . I went up to my room while she turned off the TV and locked the doors . I heard her come up the stairs and go into her room . I got into bed still trembling from the excitements of the evening , when Penny knocked on the door and said that I could do something for her in return . She was scared of sleeping on her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My love of petticoats and me sleeping in her bedroom would remain our secret . I jumped out of bed and went into her bedroom . As I got into her bed , Penny said that she had something for me and produced a long black shimmering satin nightie , which I noticed had lace shoulder straps and a wispy black lace hem . She told me to put in on as it would keep me warm . The feeling as I pulled this sensuous feminine delight over my head and allowing it to caress my body as it fell was unreal . The sheer pleasure of me dressed in such a lovely satin garment as I admired myself in the mirror was overwhelming . I got back into bed and watched as Penny undressed , taking off her cinched belt then her swishy taffeta skirt . She stood admiring herself in her white swinging bouffant petticoat , before she pulled it down to her ankles and stepped out of it . She was dressed only in her sexy white satin and lace French knickers , pulled tight over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fell madly in love with her . Facing away from me , she undid and took off her blouse then released her lacy bra , before picking up a crimson satin nightdress which she lifted over her head and let fall the length of her body . She then jumped into bed and together we lay , side by side , feeling the sensuous materials caressing our bodies and revelling in the sheer feminine delight which can only be enjoyed by lovers of female underclothes . I fell into the most blissful sleep of my life , only awakening when Penny reminded me that I had to leave for school in 30 minutes and suggesting that I remove my nightie , for safekeeping . <p> After breakfast , I thanked her for all her kindness and I told her she had made me the happiest person alive . She smiled , kissed me on the cheek , and said that she had a number of ideas for me if I would like to be her petticoat boy and told me to think of a female name to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Eleanore " , I said , as I went out of the door , chuckling to think that that was the name my Mother told me I would have been called , had I been a girl . <p> So happy was I , that I bounced along the pavement to school , without noticing a thing , for I was dreaming of what things Penny would devise for me in the coming weeks .

Like most girls her age , Kristy had fallen prey to the ' Neo-Latin ' retro craze sweeping the country . Short , puffy crinolines beneath bright Latino mins ; outrageously feminine frills and flounces in the Westside Story tradition . <p> Kristy was wearing a brief , layered frou-frou which barely covered her nylon stocking-tops . Checking her hemline had become a reflex action over the past few months . She spent a few moments making sure that her lacy black garters were decently covered , then prepared to display her considerable athletic talents . Strangely enough , the fact that she would also be displaying her virginal white underwear to every person in the restaurant seemed to have been lost on her . <p> The thought certainly occurred to her friends , however . <p> Mary-Lou Guilford raised her voice in sudden alarm : " Kristy , what are you DOING ? ! " she exclaimed , her eyes as round as saucers . " You 're wearing a DRESS , we 're sitting in a crowded diner ! ! EVERYBODY will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement : " You ca n't do that in HERE ! ! Do you want everyone in Chamberlain to know what you 're WEARING ? ? " Both girls were utterly mortified ; you simply ca n't do that kind of thing in public ( no matter how tempting the idea happened to be ) . <p> Kristy shrugged : she was wearing her prettiest lace panties ; no one was going to mind . It was n't as if she was an exhibitionist or something . She was sixteen ; teenaged girls did this kind of thing every time they visited the ice rink . Why were they making such a big deal , anyway ? She was simply demonstrating a handstand , nothing wrong with that . Had n't even been her idea . <p> Stepping back from the edge of the table , she found a clear space about six feet from the booth and judged she have just enough room to maneuver . By this time , the conversation had attracted the attention of the entire cafe . Heads turned , conversations died and an expectant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craning their necks to see what was going on . <p> Kristy asked Gina to keep time ; she could probably maintain her balance for about a minute . Gina checked her wristwatch and nodded . <p> Mary-Lou shook her pretty little head in complete exasperation : Kristy was actually going through with this ! ! In a very few seconds , she 'd be standing on her hands with her DAINTY WHITE UNDER THINGS on full view . She 'd never felt so embarrassed in her entire life . Her best friend was about to model her FLIMSIES for half of Chamberlain . She buried her face in her hands , peeking through the bars of her fingers . If this got out , they 'd NEVER live it down ! ! <p> Kristy raised both her hands high over her head . Her body became a supple , elegant curve as she drew in a calming breath . Every eye in the cafe followed her motion as she went over , bracing her palms flat to the tiled floor . Gracefully arching her spine , she flew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows , toes extended towards the ceiling . An admiring gasp went up from the booths . <p> Kristy 's skirt immediately fell away , inverting itself in a rush of glaring white taffeta . Her flouncing petticoats hung upside-down from her waist , revealing her flimsy white underwear to the entire room . Dozens of jaws dropped simultaneously . Kristy adjusted her position by shifting her palms , then brought her heels slowly together . <p> Her panties were white nylon briefs : sheer and fine and as innocent as virgin snow . The material shimmered like liquid satin . Tiny silver ripples flowed across the fabric as Kristy shifted her centre of balance . The hips were trimmed with delicate floral insets ; you could almost see the rosy hue of her skin through the gossamer lace . There was a space of about two inches between her panties and the top of her petticoats . Her tummy button was clearly visible . <p> Kristy touched her heels lightly together , paused three seconds , then began to scissor her legs apart with an incredible sense of ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long golden hair was sweeping the floor . No one could see her face , hidden as it was by her upturned skirt . She continued parting her legs . Her undies had been on full exhibition for nearly thirty seconds . <p> Frilly , black garters were stretched taut along her lean , tapering thighs . They bridged a six-inch gap between her panties and stockings . The flesh was soft , pale , and mirror-smooth . The suspenders looked strained to the breaking point . Another ounce of tension and they 'd snap with a musical twang ( or so it appeared ) . Kristy had beautiful legs : long , slender and quite curvaceous . Her sleek , brown stockings seemed to add inches to their length . <p> Mary-Lou stared open-mouthed at her friend , unable to believe that Kristy had actually gone through with it . Everyone in the restaurant was watching her . People were actually pausing in the street , looking in through the window . By the end of the afternoon , the news would have spread all over town . Kristy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Fifty seconds ' , Gina said , glancing down at her wristwatch . She shook her head in open admiration . <p> Kristy was now doing a full ariel splits , her legs forming the letter ' T ' . Her stockings had stretched a further two inches along her thighs , but the seams were still completely straight . Her panties were gleaming beneath the diners fluorescent lights . The garters were strung tighter than bowstrings . She held the splits for another five seconds , then carefully began to bring her legs back together . Her petticoats rustled softly as she altered her position . <p> Jane watched spellbound , her cheeks burning with a high , crimson blush . Kristys panties were extremely pretty , just as she 'd told them . No point denying that one : they were on exhibiting for like a zillion people . Janey had never felt so embarrassed in her entire life ; it was almost as if HER pink cotton drawers were being displayed to all and sundry . <p> ' Sixty seconds ' , Gina remarked in gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tremor . <p> Kristy 's heels came back into line . Her body became a taut , rigid javelin aimed at the sky . She seemed breathless with concentration : an eternity appeared to pass while Kristy realigned her centre of gravity . A flash bulb went off somewhere near the back of the restaurant . Then slowly , imperceptibly , Kristy 's feet began to separate again . <p> Inch by inch , with infinite patience , Kristy extended her legs in a classic One-Eighty : right leg thrusting forward , straight as a foil ; left leg slicing back . Her long , sleek thighs trembled slightly as she locked her knees into the forward splits . One of her suspenders finally snapped , releasing its hold on the stocking with an insolent pop . <p> ' One minute thirty ' , Gina whispered , mainly to herself . <p> Hidden behind an avalanche of taffeta frills , Kristy was blushing to the hairline . She was grateful no one could see her flushed , feverish expression . Despite her earlier indifference , she was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety seconds with her lace and garters on full exposure . <p> She was flinchingly aware of everything she was wearing : shimmering gossamer panties clinging to her body like a gleaming second skin ; her decadent black garter belt with the adjustable straps ; the sheer Dior nylons with the seams running down the back . All of it revealed to the world in a fall of cascading crinoline . The cafe had been full of men . What had she been thinking ? <p> Well , it was far too late to worry about that now . She 'd been hanging upside-down with her skirt over her head for close on two minutes . Time to conclude the routine . Filling her lungs with a deep inhalation , she gradually raised her feet towards the roof . Cool air caressed her thighs and tummy . Her head was swirling with conflicting emotions ; she felt naked , vulnerable , deliciously exposed . <p> ' OK ' , she murmured as she clipped her heels together , signalling the end of the routine . Folding at the waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoats flipped neatly back into place , affording the crowd a final , fleeting glimpse of her lush , pantied bottom . She completed the movement by lifting her hands in a smoothly executed dismount , as if she 'd just pin wheeled off the beam . <p> Kristy slipped back into the booth , her cheeks glowing and her eyes glittering with shy pleasure . She took another sip of her iced coffee , glancing around the table to gauge her friend 's reactions . Gina looked bemused , Mary-Lou was still goggle-eyed with disbelief . Jane was incapable of meeting her gaze . The seconds tapped by in lip-biting silence . Kristy finished her IC and set the glass down on the table . <p> Kristy shrugged with disarming innocence . Her former indifference had returned ; her blush was fading to a subtle rose tint . Lowering her pulse rate presented no real problems for Kristy . Breathing control was one of the first things you learnt in this particular discipline . ' Two minutes ? ' , she mused , glancing abstractly out the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '

Of course not but I was very jealous , as they could wear and do things I wanted to , but could n't ! I was born in 1953 , with two younger sisters .

When boys would argue about something , I would try to play the mediator , as one of the girls always would , and resolve it with the " circle " intact . I was never a leader , always trying to keep the group together , but boys ' groups do n't function that way . They are more utilitarian , so I would always retreat to contact with girls as relief .

I can recall , however , at about age ten admiring young woman of about 18 years old and thinking how nice they looked .

At that time , in the early sixties , it was not unusual for women to go town or the races ( the track ) dressed very formally including hats and gloves .

A glimpse of a lace hem peaking out from under a skirt or dress was very appealing to a young bloke and probably sparked my near life long interest in soft , lacy feminine garments . Hate girls ? Not likely ! <p> ( Anonymous ) 4/21/08 <p> I had two sisters that were very pretty and the boys were always hanging around our house .

The next thing I knew I was over her lap and my pants and underwear down to my knees being spanked harder than I can ever remember . I was sobbing and begging her to stop . Mother told me to confess and I told the whole story while laying over her lap . <p> Mother took my two sisters shopping . Later I found out that one of my sisters , while shopping , got the ideal that they should buy me some pretty underwear also , so they did .

I knew the power of her spanking from before , I bowed my head and stood still as they dressed me in a stupid outfit . I looked into the mirror as I was told and saw a little girl me looking back at me . I started to cry and begged for my old clothes back .

Then one day I saw her talking to my sister Judy and I wondered what they had to talk about and old feelings came up . <p> To make this short Judy told her about my punishment when I was younger . But she still wanted to be with me with me even more . <p> Mandy R. 10/7/06 <p> I never learned to hate girls .

I remember how she would fondle me while I was dressed as her sister . In middle school , many of the other kids called me queer , and some suggested that I needed a sex change operation . My hips were wider then my shoulders . But I had to start shaving my beard at about age 13 . So I guess the male hormones won . Dad told me when I was a teenager that I should keep my legs crossed so I would not get pregnant .

I 'm sure part of it was the feelings and urges I had to wear their clothes , and the fact that I was so ashamed over it . There was probably some jealousy over their clothes , too . <p> Another reason was a cousin I had . Diane was my second cousin and was four months younger than me . She was pretty , but a tomboy and never wore dresses such . When we were 8 , I was taller and heavier than she , but she was already better than me at sports , and actually beat me arm wrestling . That made me even more unsure of myself , especially with my desire to wear dresses . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and weighed about the same .

For a few years , she ruined everything for me though . She 'd go out for baseball , soccer or anything else I tried out for just to beat me out . She also embarrassed me at the bus stop , on the school bus and at school . She 'd brag about beating me up , give me wedgies and pants me in front of other kids . If she had known of my crossdressing secret she would have totally humiliated me . Luckily we eventually went to different schools and drifted apart over the years .

True story . <p> Ken from L.A. 6/12/04 <p> Did I hate girls ? Not really . I was raised being around an older sister who wore pretty dresses , skirts ant petticoats . My mom was very nurturing and over all she had was a positive influence on my life . I admired girls and women for the way they dressed , acted and treated me . Because of that , I always felt that women and girls should be treated like queens . I was into the usual boy stuff , but not much into sports , as I was rather small .

At the time it was really uncool to like girls but I really felt she was the one for me . Sadly she moved away in 7th grade and never heard from her since . Mini skirts were all the rage from 7th grade to the end of high school and so were my hormones . At this time I really appreciated the female form and styles . It 's too bad that most of today 's women look , dress and act like men and yet , if a man were to wear a dress or skirt , he is called a cross dresser !

At an early age perhaps 4 or 5 I first borrowed my older sisters panties , a very pretty lace slip , and a dress which buttoned up the back . At that moment I knew this would be a part of my life forever and it has been . I dressed in something of hers at every opportunity and got caught quite often . Mother made me wear panties as a punishment she thought that would embarrass me or maybe it was Dr. Spock 's advise . It soon became obvious that wearing my sisters clothes was not an embarrassment and she asked me one day if I was a sissy boy or wanted to be one . Well if sissies get to wear these beautiful clothes yes . After that my sisters old clothes were left out for me and take them I did . Somehow cross dressing makes me feel like a complete person . <p> ( anonymous ) 8/4/03 <p> I can remember my sisters getting ready for school , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just sat there wondering , ' Why ca n't I go to school like that ? ' and my mom saying , ' You 're a boy . Boys do n't wear skirts and hose . ' <p> To which I responded , ' But , I 'm sorry , Mom , I want to . ' To which she said , ' Why ? ' <p> I did n't know why ; to me , in a dress was me . So one day I took matters in my own hands and got dressed in my sister 's clothes on a Sunday , knowing they be home soon but I did n't care . There I was in a dress , heels , hose and slip , trying to curl my hair , when they all walked in . My youngest sister saw me first , saying something like , ' Mommy , I have another sister . ' <p> Well then comes my mom and my other sis . They got a laugh at first , then came the ideas . ' We can take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' Please , Mom ! ' My mom told me to go down stairs so she could talk to my sisters . She pretty much said that I 'm done for and I do as she says , which meant finishing dressing and going to church as I was . But the dress I had on was n't her style , so she laid out a shorter white dress to match my slip and she also had me put on higher heels . Then she did my makeup a bit and finished my hair . I looked in the mirror and saw me -- a really cute girl ! My sisters where amazed , and I was happy . <p> To make this story short , I went to church that day in my dress and heels , and my mom and sisters and me have never been closer ! <p> Bobbie Jo 2/14/00 <p> With my mother making statements like " I got it right the second time , " referring to my kid sister ( by 18 months ) , and with Dad wanting me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents over me on every occasion , I had a sort of love-hate relation with girls while I was growing up . At one point , I was overtly " I hate Girls " , but as this was right before the hormones kicked in and I wanted to date ( without success ) , and prove to my dad that I was " manly , " I do n't know if this really counts . <p> Anyway , during grade school , it seemed like I was constantly trying to at least equal Janet and never really succeeded . I feel this led me to desire becoming a Poufbunny in the first place . And that has stayed with me for the rest of my life . <p> Elizabeth 2/11/00 <p> As a child I never would have thought about hating girls , since I spent so much time with my girlfriends and playing dress up and house . It was boys who were yucky at first , but then as my girlfriends got older and we started to talk about boys and how to dress to make ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> Yes , I did manage to date a few boys , and I loved it . <p> Rhonda Risque 1/23/00 <p> I never hated girls . I really liked them and enjoyed being with them . Of course , I was jealous or envious of them since I grew up in the 1950 's . I still have many memories of the girls wearing various petticoats . I lived in a very windy area and it was n't unusual for the girls to have their dresses blow up , showing off their petticoats . One day , the elastic band on one girl 's petticoat broke and it fell to her ankles . In 1960-61 , several girls in my home room class used to stuff as many petticoats under their dresses as possible . They also wore girdles or garter belts and stockings , as well as stiletto high heels . I longed to dress that way and finally was able to wear a petticoat for the first time about 1962 , when my mother bought one <p> Alicia 7/20/99 <p> Not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my girl friend from next door . We played all the time . I loved her ; she had beautiful brown eyes . We were going to marry each other . I dreamed of wearing her pretty dresses , and was devastated when she and her family moved away . I had to make my life with the boys who were rough and I did not like very much . Yes , I was referred to as a " SHE " quite a few times . I got over the threshold and got also tough , as a matter of survival . <p> Angela Teal 12/25/98 <p> No , not at all . If you have seen the movie " Ma Vie en Rose " you might understand my position . I was a girl in a ( clichT ) boy 's body . I would spend whole weekends dressed as a girl with my friend Mary L---- who ' knew .

Well .... *grin* It 's beautiful . <p> " Merry Christmas " to all Bunnies ! <p> Joy 1/18/98 <p> No , as far as I can remember , I never had this stage . At an early age , my mother used the Dr. Spock idea of punishment of putting a dress on your boy . No , I did not like that . However , I had a girlfriend then , ( at age 6 I think it was ) , and they were playing ' no boys allowed ' games , and I wanted to be there too , and so I found this punishment dress , put it on with some lipstick I found , and went and joined them . To say the least , my mother never used that form of punishment again . However , I had to tell my girlfriend and her friends that " Grandma " could n't come back . That was my explanation . Back to the subject though , I do n't remember ever hating girls . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best . The boys , on the other hand , well , most of them did n't . I guess that was good though as it kept any potential gay thoughts far away . <p> Liesel Siobhan 1/3/98 <p> I always thought girls were wonderful . I can remember being very in love with a girl in my kindergarden class . She liked me too and we even held hands sometimes like when we sat in a circle to sing . I was crushed when her family moved away . In the third grade , I was in love with my best friend 's sister . Her class was in a different room than mine , but we met in the hall before school and started to wish each other a good morning and we would make a point of finding each other at lunch . We both took some teasing , but we did n't care . There are two other things that were really nice about this relationship . Her brother , my best friend , had the same first name as me and he thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . <p> A family near by had three girls ; the oldest was my age and we were very good friends . I knew her from before I started school . We played , daydreamed , and talked together a lot . Even though she moved away during middle school , we stayed in touch until after college . <p> I played with the boys too ; the usual baseball , fishing , and so on . The guys I knew teased me a bunch for spending time with girls , but I did n't let that stop me . It seemed to me that girls certainly had better lives than boys in some ways and I was torn between wanting to have and enjoy some of the things girls did , but also not wanting to give up being a boy . I felt bad about the fact that there did n't seem to be any way that I could be like boys in some ways and like girls in others . I was never branded a sissy or anything like that but I was n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more innocent about sex and gender than children now and I had no sisters . I believed for a long time that being a boy or a girl was a matter of how parents chose to raise their child . It seemed quite reasonable that boys or girls could change places if they wanted to and people would let them . I found it particularly touching when I read the story titled " Xmastory " at the GirlTalk site . The part where the little boy prayed that he could be a girl ; I can remember times when I prayed that same prayer . Times when the boys had been particularly mean to me and the girls had been good to me . It was n't that I really wanted to be a girl ; it just seemed better than the way I was since boys were n't allowed to be like girls at all . <p> So , what was it that I found attractive in a girl 's life ? To start with , girls could hug , giggle , and cry . Girls also got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to be pretty . Girls could be kind and gentle ; boys were very limited in expressing there feelings . On the other hand , I enjoyed being strong . I could hit'em long in baseball . I liked to hunt , fish , camp , and I was always building something . I was good at science and always had to know how things worked . All these were clearly boy territory when I was little . I 'm glad to see girls/women make the progress they have . We 're still stuck . <p> Erin 1/3/98 <p> Victor honey , you have missed out in so much beauty and joy . <p> Never did I hate girls ! I grew up in a family of all females and envied the beautiful clothes they got to wear . Sometimes I think mothers gave their daughters special preferential treatment . Most of the kids on my block in the 1950 's were sweet young girls , and I actually preferred playing with them than the guys . I was made the center of their attention and it was they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cotton socks . We all giggled and clowned around on hot afternoons trying to get me into a party dress .

I still like girls very much and can now appreciate the beauty and softness they possess . Unfortunately todays clothing styles supress the pretty feminine side of them and they miss out on soooo ... much inner warmth and glow . I am appalled at the sweat suit look you see in the supermarket on an attractive woman . It cries out , " I do n't care about myself anymore ! " On the other hand , a beautifully dressed female commands my full interest and attention , melting me in my tracks , and I wish I could command that kind of power . It is this exquisite joy I experience when I climb into pretty things made of silk , satin and nylon .

I was jealous .... as any girl would be who was not allowed to express herself . <p> Kandel 12/31/97 <p> I never went through a phase where I hated girls . But I did have a phase in which I was scared to death of them . Interestingly , this would have been the 1957-1960 era ( my age 12-15 ) in which petticoats had their greatest glory . I would see a girl I knew walking toward me on the same side of the street and I would jaywalk if necessary to the other side of the street to avoid having to speak to her . I am not sure why .

I was overwhelmed with a flush of feminity ! <p> Later , I caught glimpses of her bra through her sleeveless dress . It was so pretty . Why could n't I wear one ? Perhaps it was these things that made me afraid of girls . I knew I wanted to be one . Anyway , I feared they could see that in my eyes ... especially the way I looked at their clothes .

" I could have died , but what could I do ? Not only were they bigger and stronger than I , a mere 13 year old boy , but , in a tight pantie-girdle , any thoughts of escape were futile.So I could only follow the three of them out of the changing room in my frillie undies and thank God that the shop was closed , so no lady customers were there to laugh at me . <p> Mrs Bainbridge led me and the two salesladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frocks were on display , along with petticoats of various degrees of frilliness and lace.I was forced to try on three different frocks until they all agreed a pink brocade one was perfect for me , along with two separate frilly petticoats.It was really the lowest point of the whole day for me , because I had to also put on a pair of low-heel pink open-toe shoes with sling-back straps behind , while the three of them ' oohed ' and ' aahed ' about how pretty I looked . <p> 10 .

THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD <p> I said nothing , just looking at the ground , as we headed outside the shop.It was bad enough trying to walk in the pink sling-backs on the pavement compared to how it had been in the shop , on their soft carpet.Worse , the heels made an awfully loud " click-clack " noise as I walked between Mum and Wendy.I felt as if the whole world was watching me <p> They were n't , of course , although it seemed that way.However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our street , there were three of my school chums coming in the other direction .

" The only thing is , those pretty sandals you 're wearing do n't really look very practical for serving food , do they ? Would you like to change out of them , perhaps ?

Worse , these had narrow stiletto heels.What had I talked myself into , now ? <p> She slipped the black court shoes over my feet and to my surprise and dismay they seemed to be a perfect fit.Of course , being a perfect fit , and me being able to walk in them were quite separate matters . " Well , come on , Petula walk around , let 's see how you get on.Are these the first really high heels you 've ever worn , darling ?

WHAT GOES UP , HAS TO COME DOWN <p> Then it was time for the real test of walking back down those steep stairs in my new high heels.Walking up had been bad enough in the sandals , but now I was an inch higher.Worse , I could barely see my feet , because of my padded bra pushing out the front of my pink frock.Mrs .

Well , the strong sunlight shone through her dress , revealing to me her white panties and bra , I fell in love with her there and then and , although she was a few years older than I , I never missed a chance to be in her company , often sitting on the floor or grass , gazing at Pauline in wonderment , seeing how happy she looked in her pretty dresses and skirts floating around her legs .

I was 12 and she would be 15 , but from that day on she would always kiss me when we met or departed company . I truly loved her . <p> Not so long afterward , I was at her house -- we were all together again in her garden .

I also doubled as the stage hand and wardrobe manager . Rehearsal was every night at 7 to 9 in the school auditorium . One night after a rehearsal , I stayed later than the rest of the cast to put away the costumes . In the dressing room was a cute pleated plaid skirt that just looked divine . Removing my trousers ever so gently , I slipped into the skirt and strutted around the room . The short skirt came to my knees as it tickled the front and back of my legs . I simply loved how the pleats kicked out as I walked around .

Back at her apartment , she had laid out an entire ensemble of pretty things , in my size , to try on . She instructed me to use her bedroom and take as long as I needed . I really did n't know where to begin , so I looked over everything she gave me . The soft feel and touch of the lacy undergarments caused a swelling in my pants .

Covering those legs were a pair of real silk stockings with a shocking black seam up the back . The halter was all that held her small perfect pear-shaped breasts in place . Through the thin white silk of her halter , I could see her areola and pointy nipples . Her hair was put in a long ponytail with a little upswept curl at the end . On her feet , she wore a four-inch pair of clear crystal high heels . Her long fingernails were painted a shocking pink .

I almost passed out right there on her bed . I had dreams of her taking me sexually in her bed . In my dream , there we were the two of us dressed like visions in a sailor 's dream , making love to each other dressed as women . Our skirts and petticoats were flipping in the breeze as we passionately screamed out each other name . This excited me beyond control as I ejaculated in my panties . <p> Tenderly , she sat beside me on the bed , where she showed me how to delicately roll up my pretty nylons and slip them over my pointed toe , over my foot and gently wiggle and slide the nylons up my legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute silky garter belt , showing me how to attach the lacy tops of the nylons into the clasp .

She asked me to remove them , wipe myself dry and handed me a fresh pair of satin panties that were just as smooth and silky on the inside as the outside . Double satin panties ! I almost fainted . <p> After that , she handed me a pair of three-inch high heels to try on . She commanded me to stand up and walk around the room . All this time I began getting hard again as my hot poker bulged inside my panties . From the pile of lingerie , she picked up an ivory-colored full slip and slid it over my head . Softly , she pulled it down my slender frame over my hardness and to my knees . When she asked how it felt , all I could do was stammer and stutter . From her closet she handed me a soft full petticoat of dotted Swiss netting . Along the tiers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons . She took me to her vanity and began the makeover of my face . First , she applied a liquid foundation makeup , gently massaging it into my skin . Then a dash of face powder . Applying the lipstick took some doing , as I would n't sit still due to the dull aching bulge in my panties . The softness of my pretty undies , slip and crinoline were driving me crazy ! Appliclation of the eye makeup was done with a minimum effort , just a touch of mascara , eyeliner and drawing the extension of my eyebrows were all that was needed . I delicately painted my toenails with a delicious red polish and did the same to my fingernails nails . The final touch was a dash of intoxicating perfume . Boy did I smell good ! <p> From a mannequin on her dresser she picked up a cute short blond wig . Before she helped me put it on , she smoothed my crewcut flat upon my head . After combing the wig , spraying it and adjusting the curl , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The appearance of myself standing there in ladies ' underwear with a pretty wig on caused me to feel weak in the knees . I was in love with that chick in the mirror . <p> Miss Boyd picked out a very pretty floral dress from her closet for me to wear . It had a light blue background color with darker blue , pink and beige tiny buttercups printed on it . The skirt was full and gathered causing many folds of the soft sensuous chiffon outer skirt . The lining was made of a satin taffeta in a light blue color . As I walked around the room , the swishing sound excited me more and more . Over my shoulders , she draped a delicious white cashmere cardigan , and for my hands she gave me a pair of soft white cotton gloves with a fine lace edging . She said we were going out that night as sisters . Before we left the house she had me twirl in circles , making my skirts billow out aloft , all the while showing off my lacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing enough and adjusted it so just a glimpse of pretty delicate lace could be seen peeking out from under my full skirt .

I was instructed to put one foot directly in front of the other as I walked . This caused my skirts to sway gently back and forth as I walked , showing the fine lace trim of my slip underneath . As we climbed into her " T Bird " convertible she gave me a white silk scarf to place on my head to hold my hairdo in place as we cruised through the night . <p> She drove us down the coast to a town where neither of us was at all known . At a small roadhouse on the highway we stopped and stepped out of the car then walked to a supper-club on the waterfront .

She made it clear she did not want sex with me , as I was her student . Together , we spent the whole school year and following summer going out to dinner , the movies or just for a ride . Once she took me to the amusement park on the Palisades , where we rode the roller coaster , as out skirts flew up in our faces we laughed gaily . I 'll never forget that summer and all that she taught me . <p> I went off to college the following autumn and we lost touch with one another . <p> A year later , she fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The week after her wedding she sent me a large package .

I personally do not feel that I fit the ideal image of the classic waspish 50 's girl but never the less I will find occasion to dress for my husband who thinks otherwise ... besides it 's kind of fun !

I have long since accepted how I am and really enjoy it . I feel the ultimate in femininity is to dressed in a beautiful wedding gown . I adore the multiple layers of lace edged pretty petticoats over my gorgeous lingerie and white lace top stockings . Then the feeling of being zipped or buttoned into your wedding gown .... becoming one with your dress ! Even the slightest movement generates a sound and a feel that takes me to heaven .... its simply the best feeling in the world ! ! ! <p> I do n't understand why I like to dress ( I adore anything glamorous ) , so I cant expect anyone else to understand either ... it 's one of those things you have to learn to accept and enjoy and I do ! ! !

If you would like to take credit for this work , please contact us--credit is given where credit is due . No copyright notice was posted . Re-printed as found . <p> Reilly woke up early that morning and quickly showered and dressed in his school uniform . He was a freshman at St. Mark 's Academy for Boys , and , although his studies were progressing nicely , he was still homesick . It was November , and he had been away from home for over two months . He had always been an excellent student in grammar school and , from his earliest years , had been something of a teacher 's pet to the nuns at St. Stephen 's . Boarding school was a new experience , however ; he missed his mom and sisters and , although he never would have dreamed it before , even the nuns . St. Mark 's was a small school run by an order of cloistered priests . There were no females at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support staff were all members of the religious order . <p> This morning promised to be interesting at least . A small group of ladies from the local parish had been invited to share breakfast with some of the students and their teachers . This was to be something of a " get-acquainted " session , in that rarely had the academy grounds been open to outsiders , especially women . As a reward for doing especially well in his classes , Christopher had been selected as one of the half dozen students invited to take part . <p> The breakfast was held off the main dining hall in a separate room . The boys helped serve the breakfast , bringing each of the ladies food before taking their seats which alternated around the table , one of the ladies , one of the students , and one of the priests . Chris served Father Tom and then brought a plate of bacon , eggs , and pancakes to the woman he would be seated next to . He guessed she was nearly forty and although on the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She thanked him as he took his seat and introduced herself as Mary . Her perfume filled Chris 's senses and after being separated for months now from any female company at all , Chris delighted in the conversation and seldom let his sight off her . He spoke of his studies and his participation in intramural sporting events , and she in turn spoke of her life in the small community just down the road from the academy gates . Mary explained that she was a widow with one daughter away at college on the West Coast . Chris listened attentively and impressed Mary as a perfect little gentleman . <p> The breakfast over , the boys cleared the dishes and the Fathers expressed their gratitude to the ladies for attending . A suggestion was made to continue this interaction , perhaps by permitting the students to visit off-campus periodically . <p> Chris returned from the kitchen and moved to take his seat , but Mary motioned him to her lap where , although a little embarrassed , he felt very comfortable . With her arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive bosom and ran her fingers thru his curly hair . She told Father Tom how Chris was such a cute little child welcome to visit her home at any time , and as the priest agreed to allow the boys off grounds and thanked her for the kind offer , Chris was lost in a flood of senses . He let his head rest against her wondrous breast and let the smell of her heavenly fragrance fill him . <p> The Thanksgiving holidays were now upon them and this presented something of a problem . While most all the other students were from the region , Chris ' family lived almost 1000 miles distant . Although this was unusual , Chris ' father was a member of the alumni and hence the selection of St. Mark 's for the boy 's education . While his family was n't poor , flying home for Thanksgiving and then again in a few weeks for Christmas was more than they could afford . It was assumed Chris could remain on campus , and while that was possible , it would cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned while the students were away . A solution was quickly found . <p> The subject came up on Sunday as Mary was chatting with Father Tom after Mass at the local parish where he assisted . Mary offered to open her home to the boy for the long weekend and the priest agreed subsequent to approval from Chris and his parents . Of course , after a week of dreams filled with visions of the older woman 's breasts and the heady aroma of her perfume still in his mind , Chris ' answer was guaranteed . His mom and dad also thought it an excellent idea after a recommendation from Father Tom . <p> Wednesday , after the other boys had already been picked up by their parents or taken to the bus depot , Chris anxiously awaited his ride . His small suitcase was packed and ready to go . Just as he realized he was the last still waiting , Mary pulled up in the driveway . He sat his suitcase behind the car near the trunk as Mary came around the car and motioned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him a kiss on the forehead , explaining how pleased she was to have him for the holiday . As she enveloped him in a warm hug and drew his head against her bosom , Chris once again seemed lost in her warmth . She opened the passenger door and the boy , almost in a trance , took his seat beside her and off they drove . ( Did you notice that ? Where 's the suitcase ? ) <p> As they pulled in the circular drive to Mary 's house , Chris looked out in awe . Obviously Mary was wealthy , the house appeared almost a mansion and the grounds leading up to it were nearly as large as the entire campus . To his surprise , they were greeted as they pulled up by a tall young woman dressed in a maid 's uniform . Mary introduced the woman as Carolyn , her personal assistant and maid . The boy , his eyes glued to the woman in her short black satin dress and dark stockings and heels , blushed as Carolyn curtseyed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the house . <p> Dinner was about to be served , and after being shown the powder room where he could wash up , Carolyn ushered the boy into the formal dining room and seated him next to Mary at the large table . The table seemed almost too empty , but then Chris remembered that Mary had been recently widowed , and Mary explained that , like him , her daughter Susan had decided to stay on the West Coast with friends for the holiday . <p> Everything about the house was beautiful ; it was huge and decorated with ornate lace curtains and fresh flowers on every table . Never had he been in such a wondrous place . As the two of them chatted , Carolyn served the meal . At such an impressionable age , his body and thoughts affected by the rush of hormonal change , Chris could n't help but steal glances at the maid as she scurried about , her brief uniform showing off frothy white petticoats as she bent to place the various dishes on the table . Mary smiled knowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraction . <p> " You 've had a long day , hon. Why do n't you draw a bath for our little guest , Carolyn , and he can get what I 'm sure is some needed sleep . You 'll be sleeping in Susan 's room , Chrissy " <p> Mary went on to explain . <p> The boy noticed the affectionate manner in which she had addressed him , and while blushing slightly , liked the sound of it . <p> " Thank you , Ma'am . You 've been so kind to me . " <p> With that , Mary excused herself and Carolyn led the youngster up a long curving stairway to make an early night of it . Following the young woman a step of two behind , Chris could n't help but notice how her long shapely legs disappeared beneath the froth of petticoats . From this new vantage point , Carolyn also displayed the frilled garter tabs that held her stockings taut . Glancing over her shoulder , she smiled as she noticed the boy 's stare and gave her hips a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy into his room for the weekend , and while he was too polite to say anything , he could n't help but feel strange . <p> Susan 's room was far different from any he had been in before . It was definitely a girl 's room ; the walls papered in a delicate pink floral pattern and the bed which dominated the whole room looking as if it belonged to a princess . It was covered in a canopy hung with wispy lace as were the curtains and the vanity . " I 'm sure you 'll be comfortable here , " Carolyn said with a gleam in her eye as she entered the bath just off the room and began filling the tub . <p> Chris stole a peek into the bath and saw that it too was definitely that of a young lady : everything in pink , from the towels down to the thick carpeting . Chris waited sheepishly , anxious for the woman to leave him in privacy . <p> Carolyn re-entered the room and noticing the boy being ill-at-ease brought him relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you 'll find everything you need in the bath . I 'll be back later with your things . " <p> With that she left the room and Chris quickly removed his clothes , and , leaving them folded on the bed , hurried into the bath . For as long as he could remember , he had only taken showers , and this bath was not just a bath . The large tub was near overflowing with a froth of fragrant bubbles . Being alone , there was no need to feel embarrassed , so he slowly slid into the warm luxuriant suds . Just as the boy settled into total relaxation , he was startled by the door opening and Mary entering , Carolyn at her heels . <p> " I 'm afraid we have a slight problem , dear , " spoke Mary . Somehow your suitcase did n't make it into the car when we left the academy . I 've called the school , but there 's no answer " <p> " Oh , that 's right , I do n't remember putting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driveway , said Chris as he tried to slide deeper beneath the bubbles . I guess I will just have to wear what I came in ; it 's no problem . <p> " I 'm afraid I already sent your clothes to the laundry , " Carolyn volunteered . <p> The boy , although embarrassed by the presence of the two ladies in the bath , being in such unfamiliar surroundings , did n't dare refuse the kindness of his host . Covering himself beneath the suds , he sat quietly while Carolyn soaped his back and scrubbed him with a soft brush . He had n't been " given " a bath since early childhood . Despite his confused state , Carolyn 's efforts were pleasurable . As she knelt at the side of the tub and began lathering his scalp , Chris ' eyes were drawn again and again to the bodice of her uniform . Carolyn was obviously well endowed in that department , and peeking through the sudsy lather , Chris watched intently as her cleavage shook so closely to his face . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running her beautifully manicured fingers thru his curls . Retrieving a fluffy pink towel from the cabinet , she held it out and motioned Chris out of the tub . <p> " Do n't be embarrassed , dear , " she said with a grin . I do have brothers , you know . " <p> The boy quickly grabbed the towel and wrapped it tightly around himself as he stepped from the tub . Carolyn had already taken another and began to vigorously dry his hair . She then wrapped the towel about his head and , giving it a twist , left it bound as he had seen his mother do so many times before with her hair after shampooing . She surprised him further , however , when while he looked away , she had begun to douse his hairless upper body with body powder . His face turned bright red as this was certainly not for men . She had used a feathery puff and the powder had a decidedly feminine fragrance . <p> She giggled . " There . You 'll smell so sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and left the room . " Let 's see if the mistress has found you something nice to wear . " <p> At last he was alone again . Just as he finished drying himself , he heard the two women return to the room . <p> " It seems you 'll have to borrow something from Susan 's wardrobe , Chrissy , " Mary said from the bedroom . " I know these are hardly suitable for a nice young boy , but they 'll have to do under the circumstances . " <p> Carolyn entered the bath , and what she carried in her hands caused the boy 's jaw to drop . Carolyn offered the frilly pink nightie and matching panties to the stunned adolescent . The little babydoll had a lacy bodice and silken spaghetti straps . The panties were equally brief and , like the top , were trimmed in lace . <p> " Oh God ! I ca n't wear that ! said Chris loudly . <p> Hearing that , Mary joined them in the bath and put her arm around the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only till tomorrow and we 'll get your things from the school . " <p> " But I 'll look so funny in a girl 's nightgown , " whimpered Chris . <p> " Now , now , you put them on and I 'll find you a robe to wear . That 'll be better then , wo n't it ? " asked his host . <p> " Well , I guess so , " replied Chris , his face still beet red . Mary and Carolyn left the room and closed the door behind them . Chris lifted the dainty little panties and resigned himself to a night in girl 's frillies . He stepped into them carefully and pulled them up his legs . To his surprise , they felt wonderful , so soft and silky . Then raising his arms , he slipped the short nightie over his head and let it float down over his slim body . It too felt delicious , but that that was something that would forever remain his secret . He turned to look in the full length mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him gave him a shudder . Standing there on the fluffy carpet , he could have been mistaken for a girl , his hair bundled up beneath a thick pink towel and his body sheathed in such a sexy little babydoll of the same hue . His body gave away what his mind was thinking . As he gazed at the reflection in the mirror , his penis began to grow and thicken . How could he think this way , he thought . I 'm a boy ! Just then the door opened and Carolyn inched thru . Chris just about jumped out of his skin with embarrassment . He turned away to hide the source of his shame as Carolyn let out a giggle . <p> " You look darling , " she said , grinning inside as she caught a peek of the boy in the vanity mirror , his attempt to hide his erection failing . " Here , let 's put this on , " she said as she held a diaphanous pink robe out for the boy to slip into . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat longer and offered a degree of modesty . It too , was trimmed in lace at the shoulders , hem , and sleeves . With that , she took the boy 's hand and led him back into the bedroom . <p> Mary was there waiting , a glass of warm milk in her hand . " You look so precious , " she said as she handed the glass to the boy and kissed him on the cheek . " Drink this now ; you 'll sleep better , dear . Carolyn will stay and dry your hair for you and tuck you in ; I 'll be up later to kiss you good-night , Turning away , she winked at the pretty maid and left the room , closing the door behind her . <p> " Sit up on the bed here , Chrissy , " said Carolyn . Finish your nice warm milk and I 'll take care of your hair . " <p> Despite his embarrassment , the boy felt a delicious warmth sweep over him . He had never been pampered as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his frilly robe spread out around him , as Carolyn removed the damp towel and began to brush his curly blond hair . Whether it was the result of such a long and exciting day , or warmth of his milk , his whole body seemed to relax . As the beautiful servant girl drew her soft hands over his scalp again and again , he seemed to float away into another world . " <p> " Is n't this nice ? " asked Carolyn , as the boy could only nod . " You 're as pretty as a little girl in your nightie . You smell so sweet and lovely , dear . " <p> Chris felt lovely , too . He had never felt anything like this . He could n't explain it . One part of him wanted to scream and run , but another part of him , held captive by the light caress of the silky lingerie , the gentle attentions of the maid , and the warmth of his bedtime drink refused to leave . <p> " So soft , so pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could feel her fingers gently trace along his neck and down the bodice of the nightgown . " My beautiful little Christine , " she whispered as he laid back against her bosom , his mind lost in a trance . <p> " He felt her red-tipped finger draw across his lips and his body seemed to shiver to her touch . He hardly took note as she lay him back on the silken sheets , running one hand thru his hair and the other down and under his frilly babydoll . She pulled the lacy little panties down a bit and freed his penis , now hard and throbbing . He shuddered in delight as she took a frilly hankie from her bodice and wrapping it around his shaft , began milking him . His senses were overloaded ; the touch of the silky nightgown on his body , the fragrance of the room , the sight of Carolyn bending as she ministered to him , and the feather-like stroking of his genitals controlling his mind . Finally , as she caressed his lips with her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his whole body shuddered in spasm . His boyish juice exploded into the silken handkerchief . <p> Carolyn smiled down at their guest and gently cleaned him . He had never in his life felt so wondrous . Lifting his back from the cool sheets , she removed his robe , and now , dressed only in his babydoll with their matching panties , she pulled the coverlet over him . Kissing him on the forehead , she whispered , " Good-night , Chrissy ; sleep tight . " She turned off the light and closed the door behind her , leaving the boy asleep and dreaming . <p> The boy 's sleep was filled with dreams that would have disturbed him had they remained in his memory more than a fleeting moment . In his dream , Christopher had found himself back at St. Mark 's Academy for Boys in the room he shared with two other students . What surprised him , however , was that while the other two wore their pajamas as they climbed into bed , Christopher found himself dressed in a blue satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visiting the home of Mary , a local woman who had befriended him , he had , indeed , gone to bed dressed in a frilly nightie borrowed from her daughter 's wardrobe . <p> ***** <p> He awoke from his slumber suddenly , light streaming into the girlishly decorated bedroom as Carolyn , the beautiful housekeeper , flung the curtains wide . <p> " Wake up , sleepyhead , " whispered the maid in his ear . " Breakfast will be ready in just a few minutes . " <p> As the cobwebs cleared from his brain , the activities of the previous evening flooded back into his consciousness . As if somehow disbelieving , he quickly peeked beneath the satin sheet , blushing as his feminine attire was confirmed . <p> " Come on , sweetheart - we 'll have to hurry , " Carolyn said as she threw back the covers . <p> The teenage boy , startled , tried to cover himself , but the maid just grinned and , taking his hand , pulled him from the bed . <p> " Here , hon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , " she said , holding the diaphanous , lace-trimmed bed jacket . As the boy slipped his arms through the flowing sleeves , she smoothed it over his shoulders , letting it settle lightly over the much shorter pink babydoll . <p> Leading the youngster into the bathroom , she draped a fluffy towel around his shoulders and then , lathering a soft facecloth with fragrant soap , began to wash the sleep from his eyes . After rinsing the lather from his smooth skin , Carolyn gently patted his face dry with a soft absorbent towel . Just as the night before , Christopher stood passively , unsure of his feelings but somehow almost under a spell as everything was being done for him . Unused to such pampering , he found it quite pleasurable . Taking a toothbrush and even squeezing the paste on it for him , she said , " You finish brushing now , Chrissy ; I 'll find your slippers . " <p> Newly refreshed , he sheepishly returned to the bedroom where Carolyn motioned him to the small seat facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drawn to the lace trimmed bodice of his dressing gown . As the maid stood at his back , slowly brushing his longish blonde hair with an ornate silver brush , his mind reeled . " This is crazy , " he thought , " she 's treating me just like a little girl or something . " Despite his embarrassment , however , the more overpowering emotion was guilt , guilt that , beneath the blush , he actually delighted in her ministrations . He felt he should put a stop to all this , but the gentle stroking of the brush and the silky touch of his gown and panties on his skin seemed excuse enough to postpone any rebellion . His mind was brought back from his reverie as Carolyn knelt and slipped a pair of pink satin slippers over his feet . <p> The image of a princess being attended by her ladies-in-waiting rushed through Chris ' brain as the maid took his hand and brought him to his feet . <p> " Oh dear , we 'll have to hurry ; we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had but short wedge heels , the boy took hesitant steps . " Let me help you , sweetheart . " Reaching her hand around his smoothly covered waist , Carolyn assisted the femininely gowned boy from the room and down the wide stairs to the brightly decorated dining room . <p> Again the input from the boy 's senses seemed almost overwhelming . Here he was , being supported by a beautiful woman dressed in the briefest of costumes and smelling of the most wonderful perfume , her arm encircling his waist and pulling him close , all the while his own skin sheathed in the silkiest of fabrics ; and more , not only was his attire softly arousing as it brushed his thighs , it was exquisitely feminine . <p> " Good Morning , Chrissy , " greeted Mary , his host as they entered the room . " Did you sleep well , darling ? " she queried as Carolyn led the boy to her waiting arms . " I know a big boy like you does n't want to hear it , but you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she enveloped the boy in her arms . " I 'm sorry about your lost luggage but it was n't so bad , was it , dear ? " Blushing deeply as she gently brushed a stray hair from her young guest 's forehead , he could only nod . " It 's a shame boys never have the chance to wear such pretty things and look so nice , " she continued . " It 's just not the same around the house with Susan being away at school ; she loved playing dress-up with all her pretty clothes . " As the boy took his seat at the table , he noticed what must certainly be loneliness and heartache in his host 's eyes . <p> " Oh Carolyn , you 'd better try calling the school again and see if they 've found Chris ' suitcase , " Mary called to the maid as they finished their breakfast of melon and toast . Unsure of his emotions , Chris looked forward to finally getting back into jeans and shirt . <p> " I just tried again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , " said Carolyn as she returned to the room . <p> Noting the distress in the boy 's expression , Mary motioned him to her , and cradling the still nightgowned lad in her lap , she hugged him close . " Do n't worry , sweetheart ; we ca n't have you spending the whole week in Susan 's nightie , now can we ? " <p> Again , a sense of guilt and shame came over the boy , for that very thought seemed somehow appealing . <p> " I suppose we 'd better drive over to the school ; perhaps your suitcase is still in the driveway where we left it , " comforted Mary . " In any case , it 's time you were out of your nightie and dressed . Carolyn , take Chrissy upstairs , " the maid was directed . " We 'll have to find something else for him to wear in the car . " <p> Taking her charge in hand , Carolyn led him from the room and back up the long curved stairway . Knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris seemed to take special note of its whisper-like softness . As he climbed each step , he secretly delighted as the lace hem caressed his thighs and panty-covered rear . Before they were halfway up the long staircase , he could n't help but notice another sensation . The sensuous touch of the filmy fabric had had a dramatic effect on his adolescent member as well . Growing more tumescent with each caress , seemingly out of his control , it strained against the lacy confines of his silky panties . This new " problem " did not pass the notice of the sexily clad maid . Smiling , she let her hand glide around the boy 's waist and teasingly slowed their pace a bit . Her proximity made matters worse as the added sensation of her touch roused the now flush boy even further . At last reaching the bedroom , the boy , now almost quivering , broke free and rushed into the bathroom to hide his embarrassment . <p> " What is it , sweetheart ? " responded Carolyn , hurriedly following the boy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks ablaze , covering himself with his hands as best he could . <p> Moving his hands from their position , she let her fingertips side over the front of his gown , her nails barely brushing his now engorged penis . Her eyes noting the tent-like bulge , she teased , " It seems our little Christine enjoys being a precious little girl , does n't it ? " <p> Near fainting as she reached beneath the hem of the babydoll and caressed his throbbing malehood , the boy had to grab the edge of the sink to keep from falling . <p> " Oh Chrissy , look what you 're doing to your frilly little panties ; if it was n't for this , I 'd think you were a sweet young girl . " <p> Moaning softly , the boy , now a captive to the maid 's intoxicating caress , surrendered to the rush of pleasure . His body sheathed in delicate silk , his feet shod in pom-pomed satin slippers , and his pantied and swollen penis gently milked by Carolyn 's enveloping fingers seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's penis shuddered and released its pent up excitement into his pink panties . Christopher stood quivering , for the second time since his arrival , Carolyn had excited him to the point of sexual climax ; this time , however , he had erupted into the silky pink panties he had been forced to wear after forgetting his own clothes back at the academy . On the verge of collapse , the scantily dressed maid helped the embarrassed boy to the padded bench opposite the tub . <p> " You do look precious , Chrissy , but you really need n't blush . It 's plain you love your pretty nightgown and panties ; I 'd find it even more unusual if you did n't . " <p> The teenager looked up into the maid 's eyes quizzically . " What do you mean ? " he asked . <p> " It 's just as Mistress said , " she went on . " Boys are so deprived , never able to dress up in pretty dresses and nighties like girls . Forgetting our suitcase has given you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . " <p> " But I 'm a boy ! I should n't feel this way , " he answered ashamedly . <p> " Do n't be silly , honey , " she said , slowly lowering the now stained panties down his legs . " There 's no reason boys should n't be able to feel pretty like their sisters . " Taking a soft washcloth , she carefully washed the boy . <p> Not since early childhood had anyone seen him so intimately , though considering the occurrences of the last day , there was little left to feel embarrassed about . Both Carolyn and her mistress had treated him with a kindness and love he 'd been without since leaving for school at summer 's end . <p> " Come along now , Chrissy ; let 's find something especially pretty for you to wear in the car . " <p> " You want me to wear a dress when we drive over to school ? " he questioned , his voice almost faltering . <p> " Do n't worry darling ; before I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter rather than her son , " Carolyn joked . " And I do n't want to hear any excuses ; I know you 're just dying to wear a cute little dress and have your hair curled . " <p> Though he did n't answer , Chris knew she was right . Yesterday he would n't have imagined it , but like so much that had transpired since his arrival , he was certain the day ahead would prove most exciting . <p> Just then , Mary entered the room . " And just what are you two scheming in here ? " she said with a smile . <p> " Why , Christine was just telling me how much she was looking forward to going for a little drive , " the maid answered , her eyes twinkling . <p> " Oh , I see .... did n't I tell you wearing Susan 's things would n't be so bad , sweetheart ?

The boy 's eyes widened as row upon row of delightfully colorful dresses , skirts , and blouses were revealed . <p> " What do you think , Carolyn ? " Mary queried as she removed an exquisitely feminine pink dress from the rack . Their guest could n't take his eyes off the airy creation . The dress was a beautiful pastel satin , its bodice and skirt highlighted with a wide band of white lace . " I think our little girl will look adorable in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it pretty , Christine ? " she asked excitedly , winking at her employer . " Well ? Christine , what do you think ? " <p> " Yes , it 's very nice , " he finally answered , both women smiling at his obvious embarrassment . <p> " Nice ? ... judging from the look in your eyes , I would have thought something more than just nice , " giggled the satin and petticoat clad maid . I 'd almost forgotten ; we 'd better find you a new pair of panties , had n't we sweetheart ? " <p> Opening the top drawer of the large chest near the bed , Carolyn searched for a moment , then returned to display a darling pair of white satin panties . They were trimmed in frilly lace at both the waist and leg openings , and even more elaborately across the seat with several rows of lace running from one side to the other . <p> " My goodness ! Those are precious , just perfect for my new niece 's first day out and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid held the panties open , and steadying himself with a hand on her shoulder , the boy , one foot at a time , gingerly stepped into them . Trying to remain modest in the presence of the two ladies , Chris attempted to hold the hem of the babydoll nightie down as Carolyn slowly raised the wondrously smooth panties up over his knees . Smiling up at the red-faced youngster , she continued on , tugging the panties up all the way and her hands hidden beneath his gown , smoothed them over his recently drained member . <p> " There now ... that 's better , is n't it Hon ? " she asked the boy . Not waiting for a reply , she stood and began removing his filmy robe . <p> " Let 's not waste any time , Chrissy dear , " Mary said , taking the hem of the babydoll in her hands and lifting it over the boy 's head . <p> Standing before them in only his girlish new panties and slippers , he tried again to cover himself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have you all pretty again soon , " laughed his host . " I think our little girl should be properly powdered before donning her pretty dress " Mary directed the maid . <p> " Certainly , Ma'am , " she answered , taking a feathery puff from a wide-mouthed jar on the vanity . His eyes closed tightly , she dusted him generously with the sweet smelling body powder , coating his shoulders and ten moving down over his hairless chest and finally down over each thigh . Returning from the dresser , Carolyn held out a wispy white training bra . Unsure of what was happening , the boy took a step back , but Mary promptly instructed him to raise his arms and quit tarrying . His arms outstretched before him , Carolyn slipped the lacy confection up over his elbows , and reaching behind , clasped the hooks which secured the silky garment . Though hardly needing any support for his non-existent breasts , he did feel somewhat more modest . Any relief was short-lived however , as turning to Mary , he spotted what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his mind at least , wearing panties and a dress was one thing , but being attired in something so totally feminine was somehow moving to an entirely different plane . Entirely at their mercy , however , he resigned himself to whatever they had in mind . <p> Circling his waist with the satin and lace belt , Mary motioned him to the vanity stool . Seated , he watched in apparent awe as Carolyn now approached , a pair of sheer white stockings flowing from her hand . Removing first one slipper then the other , the maid carefully gathered the sleek looking nylon and then slipped the stocking over his foot . " <p> " Raise your leg , sweetheart ; a girl should always take care to keep her nylons straight . " As she glided the wondrously silky stocking up Chris ' leg , his breathing became more of a gasp . It did n't help as she reached beneath his little panties and guided the frilly garter tabs under and through before attaching each tautly to the lacy tops of the nylons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary returned from the large walk-in closet with a pair of white patent leather low-heeled pumps . The front of each was decorated with a pink satin bow . Still kneeling , Carolyn took the shoes and slipped them on the boy 's feet . <p> " Oh , those are darling , Christine , " she said as standing , she looked down at the pretty little shoes . " It 's fortunate Christine and Susan are almost exactly the same size ; our little girl will certainly have quite a wardrobe from which to choose , " beamed Mary . Checking the length of the dress hanging from the closet door , Carolyn rummaged thru the back or the closet and shortly reappeared , a shiny petti-slip in her hand . Though somewhat short like the dress itself , the skirt was very full . Constructed of multiple layered taffeta and edged in delicate lace top and bottom , it rustled deliciously as she lowered it over the boy 's up stretched arms . <p> Together , with the lad sandwiched between them , Carolyn and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth bodice hugging his chest and the frothy skirt tickling his thighs . <p> " Do n't you just adore this wonderful petticoat , honey ? " Mary asked , giving the skirt a shake . An almost imperceptible moan escaped from their charge 's lips as the loud frou-frou and the silken touch of the lace brushing his nylon sheathed thighs seemed to envelope him in a kind of soft cloud . <p> Taking him by the hand , Carolyn again led the boy to the vanity where , after showing him how to sit properly in a skirt , she turned him away from the mirror . " It 's time we fixed your face , dear , " the maid said taking a broad bib-like cape and tying it around the boy 's neck and shoulders . " Just wait till I 'm thru with you , Christine ; you wo n't even recognize yourself . " <p> After a few minutes , the change was remarkable . Eyeshadow , a bit of mascara , and blush had served to remove any hint of boyishness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brought a tube of lipstick close . " Purse your lips for me , sweetheart , " she asked , and after responding with a coquettish pout , she coated his lips with a pinkish gloss . <p> " Excellent , " complimented Mary ; " a little touch up with the curling iron and our little Chrissy will be perfect " . <p> Still facing away from the mirror , the boy sat quietly while Carolyn brushed and curled what had been longish hair for a boy . After looking through a small drawer in the dresser , Mary approached with two matching satin ribbons , the exact color of the dress . After tying each into a pretty bow on either side of his head , both women smiled . Still beaming , they pulled their guest to his feet . " Do n't look yet , Hon , " instructed Mary , " let 's slip your lovely dress on first . " <p> Taking the pink satin smock from its hanger , Carolyn directed the now petticoated boy to raise his arms carefully . Watchful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful garment over his head and outstretched arms . They fussed and primped , tugging it down gently until it settled over the fluffy petticoats . After fastening the row of buttons up the back , the maid removed a long sash from the hanger and wrapped it around the boy 's waist , forming a large bow in the rear , giving the dress an almost bustle like appearance . The anticipation was excruciating , but when the two women at last spun the boy to face his reflection , he almost fainted in wonder . <p> Looking back from the mirror was no teenage boy in a dress . Instead was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen . His eyes moved from her delicately painted face , down over the bodice of her lace and ribbon trimmed dress , lower to where her legs seemed to escape from a bouffant cloud of frothy skirts , and finally down to the tiny pink bows which decorated her girlish slippers . Christopher , now Christine , seemed lost in a trance . <p> " How was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to see the reflection from another angle , it hit him . As the layers of taffeta swished about his nylon-covered legs , there was no mistake . This was no dreamlike image - this was him ! He could have remained before the mirror for hours had the two women not awakened him from his reverie . <p> " Ooops , I almost forgot , " exclaimed Carolyn , rushing to the closet once more . After briefly searching , she turned with a small white patent leather clutch and a pair of white glace gloves in her hands . " We ca n't have you going and forgetting your purse , now can we Christine ? " she grinned . The gloves , though snug , fit over his hands , ending just above the wrist in a ruffled lace cuff . <p> " Now , come along , sweetheart , " said Mary , trying to rush things along . With one last look in the mirror , the boy ... er .. the girl raised a gloved hand and lightly patted a stray curl back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . With the two women , one on either side , he was led down the wide stairwell . Each held one of Christine 's gloved hands to steady the boy as he maneuvered slowly down the stairs , still a bit unsure of himself in the low heels . With every step , his frothy petticoats made a delightful frou-frou as they bounced and tickled his nylon-sheathed thighs . Once again , the youngster could feel the excitement build within the silky confines of his lace-trimmed panties . Embarrassed by his own reaction to the soft touch of his exquisitely girlish attire , he tried to think of something else , but even the smallest movement seemed to defeat him and hold his mind captive to intoxicating caress of his borrowed frillies . <p> Being November , there was an autumn chill in the air , and as they stood in the entrance hall , Carolyn went to fetch her mistress ' sable coat . <p> The maid quickly returned with a beautiful pink woolen double breasted coat . Carefully she slipped it over the lovely dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the upper shelf and opening it , took out a wide brimmed straw skimmer . <p> " Hold your head up , dear , " she asked as she tied a fancy bow under Christine 's chin . " There now , you look just adorable , Honey , " she said , her hand straightening the flared skirt of the coat . Bending , she gave the boy a little kiss on the cheek and opened the front door . <p> Looking back as they drove down the avenue , he could see Carolyn smiling and waving . Just yesterday , he had sat in the same seat , but now , everything was so different . Instead of jeans , his legs were now sheathed in smooth white stockings , and despite the weight of the woolen coat , the multi-layered petticoat made his skirt puff up all around him . He felt he was sitting on a cushion of frills , his ornately trimmed panties only adding to the froth of his skirts . Folding his gloved hands on his lap , he looked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look so nervous , dear . No one is going to recognize you now . " <p> They drove on , heading down the shaded boulevard toward the academy . " I 'm sure we 'll find your suitcase , but it will be so much of a shame ; you look so pretty as a girl . " <p> Blushing , the boy lowered his eyes in embarrassment . " Really dear , you should have been born a girl ; wearing pretty dresses is only half the fun . " The gates of the school came into view . " You 'd better let me do all the talking , dear . We would n't want you to give yourself away . " <p> Christopher froze in his seat . " Oh God , " he thought to himself , wishing that he could somehow become invisible . The large iron gate was shut , so Mary pulled up and stopped just in front and got out . Seeing a lone priest working in the garden , she called to him . The boy recognized him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was more or less retired now and spent most of his time tending the grounds . <p> " Father , I 'm Mrs. Alexander and one of your students is staying with me over the holiday . It seems we left without his suitcase . Did you happen to come across it in the driveway last evening ? " <p> " I 'm afraid not ; I was just up that way a little bit ago . " <p> " I brought my niece along with me in the car ; would it be an inconvenience if we came in and looked for just a minute ? " <p> Looking out to the car , the old priest smiled and waved to what appeared to him a pretty young girl . " Oh , I 'm afraid that 's not allowed ; the academy is cloistered to women . " <p> The boy could n't overhear the conversation , but noted the look of surprise on Father Patrick 's face . <p> " Well , is it possible you could ask one of the other fathers if they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's definitely against the rules to allow ladies inside the grounds , " and with a gleam in her eyes added , " and as cute as you look , sweetheart , I 'm afraid that applies to you , too . " <p> " What are we going to do ? It 'll be four days till it opens now , " the boy wondered aloud , a tone of alarm in his voice . <p> " Now , do n't you worry your little head , dear ; it seems you 'll get to play dress-up a little longer is all . It 'll be wonderful having a sweet little girl in the house all weekend , you 'll see . " <p> The teenager 's cheeks turned a bright red , but not out of embarrassment from wearing such girlish clothes . Rather , it was because deep within , he could n't imagine anything nicer than continuing this new and exciting experience for as long as he could . <p> The soft caress of the silky fabrics on his powdered skin and the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in like a fly to a spider 's web . There seemed no fight in this little fly either ; despite arguments to the contrary , he inched toward their silken trap willingly . <p> With his mind distracted with thoughts of panties and petticoats , Mary turned the car around and headed back home . After parking the car in the drive and leading her young charge back into the house , Mary explained what had transpired to the waiting maid . <p> Though she tried not to giggle , it was obvious to the boy Carolyn took great delight in his misfortune . " Do n't look so sad , Chrissy ; there 'll be time enough to try on all sorts of pretty things now . It 'll be just like having a real live Barbie Doll to dress for a few days . Come Monday , I 'll wager you 'll feel terrible wearing nasty boy clothes . " <p> Without her own family in the house ( remember that Mary was recently widowed and her daughter was in college on the West Coast ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It seems we 'll have a young lady joining us for dinner today , Carolyn , and not the teenaged boy we were expecting , " the older woman quipped . <p> " Should n't Miss Christine have a bath before we go , Ma'am ? " the maid asked with a mockingly serious tone . <p> " But of course , I 'm sure she 'll want to look and smell her best on her first time out to eat , " Mary responded , her voice equally serious in tone . <p> The boy stood nervously by as the two women joked , and as he fidgeted , the rustling petticoats continued their unceasing caress . The thought of actually going to a public restaurant while dressed as a young prepubescent girl disturbed him momentarily , but he knew he was powerless to alter their plans for him . In fact , the stirrings under the boy 's fluffy skirts spoke more of his concurrence rather than any complaint . <p> " Go with Carolyn , darling ; she 'll get you all ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently pushed him toward the stairs . Once again , taking him by the hand , the maid seemed to treat him more as a five-year old than the teenager he was . Rushing up the stairs , pulling Chrissy behind her , the boy 's skirts bounced and rustled while below , Mary smiled up at the frothy vision as it disappeared into the bedroom . Everything had gone according to plan . In just one day , they had transformed the boy into a gaily and exquisitely delicate little miss . And much to her delight , it was obvious in his eyes that he was beginning to love this new life . <p> Carolyn closed the door and directed her charge to the satin ruffled vanity bench . The boy plopped down , one leg bent back under him and looked back over his shoulder , the look in his eye as if waiting for her next instruction . <p> " My goodness ! Christine ! Is that how a young lady behaves ? If that 's the way you treat Susan 's lovely dress , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Startled , the boy did n't know what to think . Had she really offered to end all of this ? And , more to the point , is this what he really wanted down deep ? Reflecting on all the events of the previous 24 hours , it did n't take long for him to stand , and spreading his petticoats and skirt carefully , more gracefully took his seat again . <p> " I 'm sorry , Ma'am , I 'll be more careful , " he whispered , his eyes downcast in shame . <p> The boy 's eyes followed her across the room , drawn to her long stockinged legs and the brief skirt of her maid 's dress . As her hips swayed with each step , the youngster sat mesmerized . The sound of water splashing in the tub filled the room as Carolyn re-entered the bedroom and stood behind the seated boy . <p> Lowering her head till her face was reflected in the mirror , framed by the pink ruffles highlighting the shoulders of the dress they had him wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squeeze . <p> " You look so precious , Honey . You 've made Mistress very happy . " <p> His carefully made up eyes looked at her in the mirror , asking for explanation without a word . <p> " Madam misses her daughter so much since she left for college . Having you here dressed so prettily is just what the doctor ordered , I think , " Carolyn responded . As the blush spread over his face , the maid began untying the satin ribbons from Chris ' hair . Then , taking the silver hairbrush from the vanity , she started brushing the tangles gently . <p> " You do n't know how happy it makes me to see Madam smiling again , " she went on . " I 'm sure she 'll really hate to see her little girl go once the weekend is over . " <p> The boy rested his head back against her wondrously fragrant bosom as she slowly moved the brush through his longish curls . Closing his eyes , he seemed to melt into her encompassing warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move along , " Carolyn roused him . Taking his hand , she brought him to his feet and removed the matching sash which circled the waist of the pink satin smock . As he stood before the mirror , she undid the buttons in the back and sliding the dress over his shoulders , let it fall to the floor . After placing it on a scented hanger , she returned and did the same with the bouffant slip . It collapsed into a mountain of froth around his knees , and , extending her hand for support , had him step gingerly from the lace cloud . No sooner had she returned from the large walk-in closet than he felt her hands at his hips , taking the frilled waistband of the silk and lace panties and drawing them down , careful not to snag the delicate fabric on the frilled tabs of his garter belt . <p> As he tried to cover himself , she slipped the white panties down over his knees and then gently lifted one foot , then the other to leave him standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He again looked in the mirror to see an image which now made him almost tremble . With his hair newly brushed and his face still made up , the sight of himself standing dressed as he was with the sexily clad maid at his back unclasping his brassiere seemed a dream . She delicately took the each ribboned strap between her beautifully manicured fingertips and pushed them down over the curve of his shoulders . As she pressed her bosom against the now bare skin of his back , she glided her hands down around his neck and then lower till they covered the nipples of each breast . <p> Cooing in his ear , she brought him to a state of complete distraction , " You have such lovely little breasts , Christine . " Scraping the tip of her fingernails over the now stiffening flesh , she teased , " See how your girlish little nipples stand up ? " <p> By this time , the excitement had spread far beyond just his non-existent bosom ; his thickening member could no longer be hidden . Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> With one hand continuing to caress his breasts , Carolyn reached around and took the discarded panties from the vanity , and , placing them over his throbbing shaft , began to milk the boy . <p> As she slid the silky panties up and down along his member , he began to shudder , " Yes ! Yes ! Make me your little girl ! ! " With that , his shaft erupted into the delicate little panties and he collapsed down onto the vanity seat . <p> Hugging the now exhausted boy against her , Carolyn ran her fingers through his hair and kissed his forehead . " That 's my girl , my precious little Christine . " Unsnapping the garters , she drew the long white stockings down his legs , and removed them . Drawing him to his feet , she unhooked the belt and laying it aside , led the compliant boy into the bath . Shutting the water off , the large tub was near overflowing with fragrant suds . She removed a silk scarf from the linen closet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . Helping Christine into the water , she knelt beside the tub and began to sponge the sweet smelling lather over his shoulders and back . Lifting the yielding boy 's arms , she swabbed under them and then moved lower over his chest and lathered his stomach . As Christine sat passively , the strikingly beautiful maid reached beneath the surface and no part of his anatomy was left unwashed . Taking a soft washcloth , she began to wash the makeup from his still beardless face . <p> " Close your eyes , dear " she warned as she gently cleaned the last vestiges of mascara and eyeshadow from his eyelids . Using the long hose sprayer , she rinsed the soap off him , and then holding a soft towel up , had the boy step from the tub . After Christine was properly powdered , Carolyn had him sit on the bed as she selected his wardrobe for the afternoon 's excursion . A little over an hour later , Carolyn came into the den where Mary was waiting . She no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed off her stunning figure in a long blue silk gown . Mary , too had changed for their dinner out . Though certainly not a beauty queen , the older woman still looked elegant in a stylish black suit . <p> " Is our guest ready ? " Mary asked . <p> " Yes , Ma 'm , she 'll be right down . " With that , Carolyn called up the stairs , " Come down , Honey . We 're ready to leave . " <p> Christine appeared at the top of the stairs . She was a lovely vision in white . The maid had certainly chosen well for there was n't a hint of masculinity left in the boy , rather he ( now she ) looked the perfect little princess . The dress was all white lace accented by delicate pink satin bows across the bodice and at the puffy sleeves and hem . From their vantage point , the two women could easily view what must have been several layers of crinolines under the wide almost floating skirt . Around his waist was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip with a huge bow . He stepped carefully down the steps , his feet in white patent leather Mary Janes , highlighted by white anklets trimmed with a turned down pink lace cuff . Short white gloves covered his hands , each tied at the wrist with matching pink satin bows . His hair was styled exquisitely , his blond curls piled high and circled with a tiny little tiara . Though the dress gave the impression of girl no older than seven or eight , Christine 's makeup appeared dramatically more grown up . It was obvious that , in addition to lipgloss , blusher and shadow , Carolyn had also made use of false eyelashes . <p> His eyes lowered , he stood at the bottom step and finally , his long lashes fluttering , looked up expectantly at his host . <p> " Oh Christine , you look absolutely wonderful , " exclaimed Mary , thoroughly pleased at the latest transformation . " I wish Susan could be here to see how darling you are . " After donning their wraps , the two ladies led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown to the restaurant . <p> ***** <p> Though a small town , the eatery was crowded with those who had opted for Thanksgiving dinner out . The restaurant was the finest in the area , its oaken paneling and velvet draperies giving an impression of aged elegance . The maitre-d ' greeted the trio warmly and escorted them to a table on the slightly raised mezzanine . All eyes were on the cute little girl as she made her way between the other tables . Christina could n't help but overhear the whispered admiration as the other diners paused and noted the precious darling accompanying Mrs. Alexander . Self-consciously , Christine took his seat as the waiter held the chair for him , making sure to gracefully spread his skirt and petticoat . It was with an almost audible sigh of relief that Mary ordered for him . <p> While the two ladies ordered white wine , a Shirley Temple was suggested for the youngster . The meal itself was wonderful , though Christine felt on pins and needles throughout . <p> After the traditional turkey , cranberry sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another soft drink for her niece . <p> Despite the boy/girl 's embarrassment , Christine could n't wait any longer . " I have to use the restroom , " he finally whispered . <p> Smiling , the maid quickly summoned the waiter and asked , " Could you tell me where the powder room is ? It seems our little guest had a bit too much to drink . " <p> After being shown the way , Carolyn took sheepish girl by the hand and led him down the hall to the door marked " Ladies . " <p> Thankfully , the elegantly decorated room was otherwise unoccupied . Carolyn latched the door to provide some privacy , and to Christine 's surprise , backed him into one of the stalls . Lifting the young boy 's skirt and petticoat , Carolyn seemed to take charge . <p> Here , Honey , I 'll help you . Hold your dress up now . " As his cheeks turned a deep red , his lace trimmed panties were lowered to his knees and the maid inched him back until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chagrin , Carolyn then gently took his soft penis in her hand and held it down , aiming it for him . " Go ahead , dear ; let me see my little girl tinkle . " <p> The boy felt totally mortified ; never had he been treated like such a completely helpless child . Despite his humiliation , Carolyn smiled as the sound of water splashing in the bowl echoed in the small stall . When he was finished , instead of replacing his panties to their former position , the maid had the boy stand , his petticoats still raised to waist level . She took a tissue and gently dried the tip of his penis , and with the frilly white panties still around his ankles , she opened her purse and removed a small container . He looked down just as she opened it and watched as she removed a soft feather puff . After coating it with perfumed powder , she carefully dusted him , paying attention to cover not only his genitals , but also down along the length of his thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky penis , and then reaching down , slowly pulled his panties back to their original position . <p> " All finished , sweetheart , " she said , helping to straighten his petticoats as they floated down over his legs . <p> After washing his hands , Carolyn had him face the mirror , and , taking a lipstick from the small white purse he carried , retouched the creamy gloss that coated his lips . " Feel better now , Honey ? " she asked , opening the door and escorting the embarrassed youngster back to the table . <p> Still blushing , Christine took her seat , as Carolyn 's eyes met Mary 's and the two women shared a knowing smile .

I 've collected some newspaper advertisements , and have noticed that in an ad for a girl 's bouffant slip , there often will also be a mention of " matching petticoat .

Or was it simply a matter of making the same style of petti-skirt available both as a separate petti or with an attached bodice ? This reference did not appear throughout the Era , more from about 1957 to the early 1960s . It does n't appear that this applies to women 's lingerie , because I 've never seen the reference to matching petticoat . <p> A : It WAS offered occasionally with womens lingerie ( just for times when one was more appropriate than the other ) , but it was mostly a young girls thing , and for a specific reason : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size 12 ( the largest ) .

I was about twelve years old and unaware of the drastic changes that were about to overcome my well being and sexuality on that special Halloween night in 1956 . <p> Up until this point in my life I was a typical bike-riding boy with a slingshot in my back pocket and a frog under my hat . Baseball , swimming , fishing and muskrat trapping were the main pursuits in my red blooded male existence .

My life would change forever in the days quickly approaching Halloween of that year . <p> The kid across the street had invited all the boys and girls in the neighborhood to a spectacular Halloween party , a few days before the actual holiday itself .

About the time I decided to don the dress , my sister had just come home from a friend 's house , and she agreed to help Mom dress me in my costume . She took great joy in creating a kid sister out of her little bratty brother . <p> The skirt and bodice were all one piece and I slipped it over my head . " Sis " zippered up the back and synched me in tightly . Before I put on the satin dance panties , I slipped up a pair of green nylon panties that said " Friday " on them .

The skirt was lacking pizzazz as Mom made me put on two multi-colored nylon net crinolines under the red , white and blue satin skirt panels . Now the skirt gently laid atop the taffeta outer layer of the petticoats , where any movement cause the skirt to swish and sway over the top of the puffy material . We decided one crinoline was enough , and the skirt now relaxed to a more normal " A " line appearance . The multi-colored satin skirt now rested to a point just above my knobby knees that really looked pretty good cloaked in the silk stockings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I complained of it many times while dressing .

It did look delightfully elegant , so soft and smooth with a four-inch lacy border around the hem . How it would keep me warm puzzled me , but it did feel good lying between my sleek stocking legs and the layer of scratchy crinoline petticoats . <p> When it was suggested I wear makeup , I resisted until I saw the pretty red lipstick Mom picked out for me .

Mom and " Sis " had a good laugh at my expense as the door closed behind me and I stood out on the streets of town dressed as a very pretty young girl . I am glad it was very dark and I only had to walk two blocks to the party . <p> The short walk was quite a new experience , as I made fruitless efforts to keep the wind from blowing my satin skirt and nylon petticoats all over the place .

We walked around the room , passing some adults , both men and women , aunts and uncles , who sat in as judges of our costumes . There were typical pirate costumes , witches , ghosts and scarecrows . Mine was the only costume not related to the holiday . When the marching was all over and the votes in , I won first prize , hands down ! Then came the unveiling of our costumes .

Joe sat on my right and Larry on my left . As the food was being served the two boys were tormenting me by running their dirty hands and fingers up my silkened legs and trying to penetrate my satin panties , roughly grabbing at my little penis .

Susie was running her delicate little hands over the slick satin covering my chest , causing my nipples to harden at her touch . Margie was fascinated with the smooth round feel of the satin panties as she stroked my rear whenever I would bend over .

Outside the bathroom all I heard were catcalls and howling over my costume . The two boys managed to pry open the door and burst into the toilet just as I had my panties down around my ankles . Flash bulbs went off everywhere as I struggle to pull up my satin ruffled dance panties and quickly buttoned them .

I let her unzip my top and pull the tunic down around my waist as she sweetly kiss each nipple . In turn she would allow me to squeeze her budding breasts under her costume . <p> Just then Mr. Sharp came in the closet and chased her out . He stood over me as I lay on the floor half undressed from the top down . Mr. Sharp helped me to my feet and zipped my dress back up . He said , " Are you all right ?

They would have a contest judging which outfit I looked best in . The winner got to kiss me on the lips and an opportunity play with my hardened penis , while the others all watched . Often , I would let them take turns fondling me or spanking my bare behind . We spent many a hot summer afternoon in these activities , sharing secrets like little sissy sisters . We still write each other from time to time and reminisce over those long bygone days of our innocent sissy childhood and I wouldn ? t have it any other way .

I was just little but I do remember the department store try-on rooms . They were semi-private areas . Some girls were so sensitive they never tried on anything . But most did n't mind . I noticed that one girl is wearing a quilted skirt , so it 's most likely winter .

Under her dress , she was wearing two white petticoats , so theyd look like they were even wearing the same lingerie as well . <p> About fifteen minutes later she went back in the bathroom and told him to stand up on the bath mat while she dried him with a fluffy towel .

" Now my pretty girl is all set for today , " she said , still smiling . She bent down and gave him a hug and kissed his cheek . Even though he did n't  like to have to wear girl clothes again , he put his arms around Betsys waist and hugged her . <p> " Sweetheart , this summer is going to be one wonderful day after another !

He sat at the kitchen table and opened it up . Inside there were pictures of Little Bo Peep , Cinderella , Alice in Wonderland , Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz , fairies and butterflies , and cute little kitties . Betsy put a big box of crayons on the table near him . <p> " I bought these for you a couple of weeks ago before you got out of school , " said Betsy with a nice smile .

She had a big smile on her face as she held his hand and walked back into the parlor with him . <p> They sat down on the couch together and Betsy slipped her arm around his shoulders . She noted with satisfaction that he remembered to smooth his dress behind him when he sat down , and to keep his knees and feet together . <p> " Your little girl ? " said a surprised Sally .

" said Sally . <p> " And he really does make such a pretty little girl . And mother and daughter dresses ! That 's so sweet !

" <p> " Oh , I do n't  blame you ! " said Sally . " How long is he going to be your little girl ? " <p> " Well at first I thought I 'd make him my little girl just for the summer . But I think he s already too much like a girl to let him ever be a boy again , " said Betsy . <p> " Oh ! You must be delighted with how he looks , " said Sally .

" asked Sally . <p> " Yes Mrs. Carter , " he answered , forcing himself to smile a little . <p> " Sweetheart , " said Betsy , " Stand up and show Mrs. Carter your pretty panties and slip dear . " <p> He got off the couch and went over to Mrs. Carter . Then he raised up his dress and poufy slip so she could see his panties . " <p> " Turn around honey , so she can see the back of them too , " said Betsy .

She gently pulled him to her and gave him a big hug and kissed his cheek . He held onto her waist while she hugged and kissed him . Then she let go of him and he sat down next to Betsy again . <p> " Betsy , he makes such a well mannered and pretty girl ! You must be very proud of him . How do you ever stop hugging him ? !

There 's a lot more little girl things I have to teach him . " <p> " Oh ! I envy you so much ! " said Sally . " It must be like a dream come true ! " <p> " Yes , it is , " said Betsy . " And I can tell that he s starting to really like being my little girl now . Are n't  you darling ? " <p> " Yes Mommy , " he answered . " Being a girl is a lot nicer than being a boy .

He thought Mrs. Carter was a nice lady . She smelled very pretty when she hugged him , just like Mommy did . He could hear the two women talking and laughing a little . <p> He had almost finished coloring in a picture of a little kitty when he heard Mommy calling him back to the parlor . He got up and shook the skirt of his dress and poufy slip to make them fluff up pretty again . Then he walked back into the parlor . <p> " Yes Mommy ?

" If you let me have the negative , I 'll get a big enlargement of it to hang here in the parlor . " <p> " No , no ! " said Sally . " Thatll be a present for you .

Its wonderful how he looks like such a pretty girl ! He s a lucky boy to have a mother like you ! Let me take a picture of you sitting down together . " Both of them had nice smiles . <p> Betsy and Beth sat down on the couch . Betsy put her arm around Beths shoulders and Sally took another picture of them . <p> " Thanks so much Sally , " said Betsy as Sally put the camera back in her big pocket book .

" She came over and gave Beth a hug and kiss goodbye , and then said goodbye to Betsy and left . <p> " What other girls Mommy ? " asked Beth . <p> " Sweetheart , " explained Betsy , " ladies sometimes call their friends girls even though they 're big ladies . Shell bring over some of Mommys other friends with her when she brings the nice big pictures of us . I 'm so glad we wore our mother &amp; daughter dresses again today . Itll be just the type of nice big picture I can put on the parlor wall for all our visitors to see . Wont that be nice honey ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy ? " he asked a little frightened . What if some of his friends stopped in looking for him ? Thatd be awful ! <p> " Yes sweetheart , " said Betsy , as if she could read his mind . " But do n't  worry honey . Your friends would n't know you if they saw you now . " <p> He thought about that for a while . In one of the dining room buffet drawers , there was a picture of him Mommy had taken when he was still a boy . He decided to get it later and see how much different he looked now . <p> When he finished helping Mommy do the dishes that night , he went out to the buffet while Mommy was putting the plates and things away . He pulled open the top drawer . There were a bunch of 5 " X 7 " pictures in a fat envelope . He began to go through them , and suddenly he found the one of himself taken about a two months ago when he was still dressed like a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his hands . He placed it along side his face so he could see it next to him in the mirror over the buffet . Suddenly Mommy snatched it out of his hand ! <p> " I just wanted to see the picture of myself when I was a boy Mommy , " he said . <p> " No , no sweetheart , " she said . " Youll have a much nicer picture of yourself soon , with Mommy standing next to her little girl . I do n't  think it would be good for you to look at this old picture . " She quickly tore it into pieces and dropped them into a waste basket . <p> " But why Mommy ? " he asked . <p> " Because you 're a little girl now dear , " she told him . " And your memories now will be much nicer ones than when you were a boy . Honey , some day when you 're older , you 'll look back at this time as the happiest days of your life . All little girls do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new hair style on you . " <p> " Yes Mommy , " he said , still feeling disappointed about the picture . <p> Betsy took his hand as they went upstairs to her room . She had him sit down at her dressing table and untied the bow on his ponytail . <p> " Gee Mommy ! " he said in surprise . " I thought you liked my ponytail . " <p> " I do dear , " said Betsy . " But you might look even cuter with two of them . " She began to divide his hair in back of his bangs , and combed it to the sides , combing the hair on his neck forward to the rest of it and slipped an elastic band over it . She did the same thing on the other side of his head . Then she tied pretty pink ribbon bows over the elastics on both sides . Bending her head down next to his , she looked in the mirror with him . <p> " Oh ! You look so darling ! It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are now ! Do you like it sweetheart ? " <p> Gosh ! He looked like a girl that was only about or five six years old ! And being a shorter than most boys his age , people probably would think he was a really little girl . <p> " Two ponytails Mommy ? " he asked . <p> " Yes honey , " said Betsy with a loving smile . " You look so cute ! She bent forward and gave him a big hug from behind . <p> " You 're so precious ! " She kissed his cheek . <p> " I wish I had started dressing you nice and pretty when you were about three or four years old . You would have looked so sweet at that age ! But Mommy loves her little girl no matter what age you are . " She kissed his cheek again . <p> As they sat on the couch together , Betsy put an arm around his shoulders and primped his bangs a little . <p> " You know honey , " she began , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd look like such a pretty girl . Are n't  you happy being my little girl now sweetheart ? Mommy tries to buy you the prettiest things to wear and other things to play with . Do n't  you think being a girl is better than being a boy now ? Tell Mommy the truth sweetheart . " <p> " But Mommy , how can a boy turn into a girl ? " he asked . <p> " Well honey , maybe someday a doctor will be able to turn you into a real girl . But until then , is n't it nicer dressing pretty and doing girl things ? Mommy tries very hard to make you happy and to teach you everything about little girls ; not just how they dress , but how they keep themselves pretty , and to be polite like a good girl . Sometimes in the morning , after I 've dressed you up nice and pretty , Ive seen you smile at yourself in the mirror . Little girls always do that when they see how pretty they look . And you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it sweetheart . " <p> " But Mommy , " he said , " I do n't  have anyone to play with now . My friends would n't want to play with a sissy . I wish I was still a boy . " <p> " Do n't  worry darling , " said Betsy . " Now that you know how to behave like a nice girl , you 'll start playing with other girls . " <p> " Girls Mommy ? " <p> " Yes honey , " answered Betsy . " Youll have lots of fun with other little girls . By the way , that reminds me . Tomorrow Mommys going to take you shopping for a few things you can play with . And maybe well get you some more new things to wear , too . " <p> " What kind of things can I play with Mommy ? " he asked . <p> " Well , every twelve year old girl should have a nice doll to play with sweetheart . And well get you a jump rope and a set of Jacks to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked in dismay . <p> " Yes precious . There 's a lot more to playing with a doll than boys know .

" <p> " It means something that is very special that you love . And that 's the way Mommy feels about you dear . " She tugged him to her side and gave him a kiss on his cheek , her eyes shining with happiness over having such a cute little girl now . Still , she knew that it was n't the only reason she had started to dress him like a girl . She had no idea where her ex-husband was , but she wished he could see what she had made out of their little boy . Happiness at having a little girl and revenge on her ex-husband ran side by side in her . <p> But she did love Beth .

She was a beautiful woman and Mommys favorite actress . And at the start of the show , she always came through a door and spun around to close it , her skirt flaring and her petticoats swirling into view . Betsy thought it would be a good program for her little girl to watch . She could explain the " big people " parts of it to Beth . <p> But later when there was a commercial , she looked down at Beth with a smile .

" said Betsy as she pulled him tighter to her side and gave him a kiss on his cheek . <p> Later that night when Beth was in bed , Betsy got into her bed . As she lay there waiting for sleep to come , she wondered what the things were about being a girl that Beth already liked . She hoped with all her heart that they were the precious and pretty things that all little girls liked .

It had appointed her foster mother and guardian of the neglected seven year old child of her drug addicted cousin ( from a different branch of the Meene family tree ) and his equally addicted slatternly common-law wife , both now declared unfit parents and beginning long prison sentences for dealing in heroin and other drugs . Neither Lilith nor Sally had been informed the of the childs gender nor name due to a secretarys error of omission . The two women arrived at eight-thirty on a Friday morning and were taken to the office of the director and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hangover due to the previous nights excessive drinking . But he brightened up and smiled when he saw the two pretty women . <p> One look at Sweeney with his pencil-thin moustache and oily looking slicked black hair and Lilith sized him up as a pathetic little bureaucrat with an inflated ego . To make the whole business even more unpleasant , the lecherous Sweeney kept leering at Lilith during the entire time they were there . Lilith regarded Sweeney as if he was some sort of barnyard animal , and returned his leering with a look as would split rocks ( an Irish expression ) ! <p> Both women were prettily dressed for the occasion , wearing full dresses with petticoats under them , their hair pinned up in a bun at the back of the head called a chigon ( a French word , pronounced chen-nyohn with the last syllable given a nasal pronunciation ) . The style was a popular neat one among women at the time , keeping their hair up and away from the neck in the warm April weather , but gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school teacher when they werent smiling . They placed their hands behind them and smoothed their dresses , petticoats and half-slips under them as they sat down opposite Sweeney at his desk . <p> Lilith introduced herself and Sally to Sweeney and handed him the court order she had received . <p> " I 've been looking forward to meeting you , " said Sweeney , having been told of the stupendous Meene family fortune . " We received our confirmation of the Family Court order a few days ago . Normally we do n't  allow an unmarried woman for a foster mother , but its within my purview to make an exception when a woman of your means and obvious quality is involved ( Sweeney could lay it on thick when the situation called for it ) , and after all , you are a distant aunt of his as well .

" said Lilith , aghast at the thought of having a little boy knocking over the antiques in her lovely home as he ran around inside with his pals , screeching like a wild Indian and disrupting her and Sallys enjoyable life of the idle rich . <p> " Yes , " replied Sweeney , " a boy . I thought you knew that . But Pauls a good little boy . I doubt hell give you any trouble . Ill have him brought in here with his things and you can meet him . " <p> Sweeney spoke into his intercom . Soon a stout matron bought the little boy in with the rest of his few tattered and patched clothes in a state-issued cheap suitcase made of simple cardboard panels folded together , and a thin plastic strap for a grip . <p> " Say hello little fellah , " said Sweeney . " These are the nice ladies you 're going to live with from now on at their home . " <p> The little boy smiled and said hello . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long blond hair like her own , a clear medium complexion also like her own , the rosy blush of youth on his cheeks , a slim youthful build , about four feet tall , and a cute face and smile . <p> " I apologize for the length of his hair , " said Sweeney , " but Paul had schedule conflicts during the last year and a half with the dentist whenever the barber was here . But he does have an excellent first teeth , and he s never had a cavity . " <p> A bit different from Lilith in her feelings about children , Sally rarely thought about little boys , but she thought little girls were so cute and huggable wearing their little poufy slips and pretty dresses in the new bouffant style . <p> " Well , there 's not much more to say or do , " said Sweeney . " I 'm sure the authorities in Albany will be glad to get my report , and know we 've placed the child in a good home with his aunt , even if you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the custody transfer form . " <p> Lilith noticed the rank odor of alcohol on Sweeneys breath as he stood up and leaned over the desk , handing the official form and a pen to her . <p> In a way , Sweeney hated to see the meeting almost over . The younger woman was a snooty gal , but she was the first gorgeous looking woman to appear on his boring job in a year or more . The older pretty gal with her had a big pair of tits and looked like shed also be a great roll in the hay . But now hed have to fill out " another one of those damn long reports " to send to the authorities in the state capital . He decided to do it later when he did n't  have such a head splitting hangover from drinking a full fifth of his favorite brand of bourbon whiskey last night , Old Plow Horse ( 120 proof ) . <p> Against her wishes about the whole business , Lilith signed the form and pushed it back to Sweeney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notary Public stamp and squeezed it , making an impression of the New York States notary seal on the page , then wrote in his Notary Public number and signed it , making the little boys aunt his legal foster mother and guardian . <p> " Good luck to you all , " said Sweeney , now glad to see them leave so he could get at the flask in his desk drawer , filled with his favorite brand of cheap " medicinal " bourbon , Old Race Horse 148 proof ( 74% alcohol ) , made by the same distillery that makes Old Plow Horse ) . <p> " I doubt luck will have much to do with the outcome , " said Lilith . " Come along Paul . Now well have some other things to do today . " <p> Now that the business was over , Lilith held Paul by the hand while the matron picked up his cardboard suitcase and they went out to Liliths Cadillac . <p> The matron placed Pauls suitcase in the cars trunk and Paul sat on the front seat between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and petticoats spilling over his legs . As they drove back home , they stopped at a HOWARD JOHNSONS restaurant for brunch . While Paul was having a hot fudge sundae for dessert , Lilith asked Sally to come to the ladies room with her while a waitress stayed with Paul . <p> Once inside the rest room , Lilith told Sally her plans for Paul . <p> " Mother , we simply cant have a little boy living with us , making a racket and knocking over our antiques when he runs around in our home playing with other little boys , " said Lilith . " But if we make him a sissy by keeping him dressed in girls clothes , and teach him to behave like a good little girl , hell be no trouble at all . I 'm legally his foster mother now , so hell be my little girl and you 're his grandmother now . He s a cute little boy and hell look like a pretty little girl . Itll be quite satisfying making a little boy a sissy by keeping him in pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less trouble than having a regular little boy living with us once we 've taught him to behave like a good little girl . What do you think ? Will you help me ? " <p> " What a nice idea ! " said Sally and smiled as she thought how nice it would be . She could hardly wait to get home so they could begin making the cute little boy look like Liliths pretty little girl and her own huggable cute little granddaughter that shed always wanted to have . <p> When they got back to the Meene family mansion , a thunder storm had begun . While the car was going up the driveway , though the house was made of wood , Paul had seen what looked like the square tower of a castle hed seen in the movies , with a small front porch on it and the front door of the house . There was a fancy little black metal fence and lightning rods on top of its slate roof , and some lilac bushes grew around the front of the house . An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an upstairs room for an elderly chauffer now retired and living elsewhere , was a little to one side behind the house . Lilith parked her Cadillac under the porte cochere at the side of the house and held Paul by the hand as they entered the side door . <p> It looked like a haunted house in the movies to Paul , except there werent any cobwebs in the big clean house . The hallway walls were completely covered with small bevel- edged panels of dark wood , and a runner of Persian carpeting was on the polished hardwood floor . <p> They went down the hallway to the kitchen and Lilith told Paul to sit down at the table as she began to make some coffee . Sally gave Paul a glass of lemonade and sat down next to him , and eventually Lilith smoothed her skirts , petticoats and slip under her as she sat down on his other side with the coffee for Sally and herself . <p> " I do n't  suppose you liked being at the child center Paul , " began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and me after we 've made a few changes to you .

" <p> Paul thought what the changes would be ; probably having to take a bath every Saturday night and getting his long hair cut . Maybe I can get a crew cut like a sailor , he thought . <p> " Your hair is quite long Paul , " said Sally . " Its down on your back now . Did n't  they give you any haircuts at the child center sweetheart ? " <p> " Just a couple of times a year , " answered Paul . " But the last four times the barber came , I was at the dentist , getting some stuff brushed on my teeth so I wont get any holes in them . The other boys called me Wild Paul Hickcock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally . " Pauls had fluoride treatments done to his teeth to prevent cavities .

There 's mouthwash in all the bathrooms . Itll make your breath smell nice and get rid of germs . Always be sure you use it after every meal . Gramma or I will help you . " <p> " Yes Aunty , " said Paul , eager to please his pretty aunty and gramma . <p> " Youll have to take a bath before we go , " said Lilith . " You cant wear new clothes without being good and clean first . Come with me Paul . Sally , please bring Pauls suitcase up to his room while I give him his bath . " <p> Lilith held Paul by the hand and led him up the wide staircase to the second floor , and into her pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the hallway . As the tub began to fill with warm water , she poured in some bubble bath solution while Paul took off his clothes . Then he got in the bathtub , and began playing with the big mound of pretty smelling bubbles . Lilith had put a rubber laundry apron on over her dress and now knelt beside the tub as she gave Paul a shampoo , first checking his hair for cooties ( fortunately there werent any ) , followed by a thorough scrubbing from head to toe . <p> Finally , Paul got out and stood on the bathmat and Lilith dried him off with a fluffy peach colored towel . Then she took him by the hand and led him down the hallway into a bedroom with the towel still wrapped around him . <p> Paul looked around the bedroom curiously . <p> The bed was a childrens full size bed for twin little girls with a ruffled edge pink canopy . The edges of a floral print comforter were trimmed with big overlapping layers of white ruffles that went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pictures printed on it of Cinderella in her gown , Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz , the fairy Tinkerbell and Alice in Wonderland . There was also a little girls dressing table with a wall mirror and a padded stool for it , having a ruffled pink drape going down from the seat to the floor . A dresser with drawers and a big mirror against the wall behind it , a taller bureau of drawers , a full length mirror on the back of the bedroom door , rose colored wall-to-wall carpeting , a fireplace no longer used , with its opening blocked up to save heat , and a large closet completed the bedrooms furnishings and features . <p> " Aunty , this looks like a girls room , " said Paul . <p> " Yes Paul . It is , " explained Lilith . " Two little girls stayed here last month while their mommy went on a vacation , and we made it nice for them . The other spare rooms need to be cleaned and aired out later this spring , so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here and downstairs in the living room . " <p> Sally had brought in his flimsy suitcase . A clean pair of blue jeans , a red tee shirt , clean white underpants and socks were on the bed . Lilith put some floral scented powder in his sneakers to get rid of any odor while Paul got dressed and fastened his favorite belt with its Roy Rogers cowboy buckle on his blue jeans . <p> Meanwhile , Sally had gone back downstairs and called FRANCINES , a beauty salon , and made a late afternoon appointment for Paul . <p> Lilith put on her white cloth gloves and took her pocketbook with her . Then she held Paul by his well-scrubbed hand again and they went back downstairs and out the side door . Sally was already in the Cadillac waiting for them . <p> As they drove towards town , a doe and a fawn ran out of the forest and across the road . <p> " Look Aunty , " cried Paul excitedly . " Its Bambi ! " <p> " Yes sweetheart , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . But you stay close to the house when you play outside . The forest is very big and dark . Youd get lost in the woods and a big bear might eat you up . " <p> Wow ! Bears ! Paul thought it was going to be fun living with his aunty . It would be ... for Lilith and Sally , but not at first for Paul . <p> They reached the towns commercial section and Lilith parked her car in front of the entrance to STEINBERGS , a department store , ignoring the fire hydrant near the right rear fender . Later , a passing cop did n't  bother writing a ticket once he saw Liliths license plate : MEENE 1 . <p> When they got out of the car , Lilith and Sally shook and rustled their dresses and petticoats to fluff them up since sitting in them tended to make them not as poufy as they liked them to be . <p> Then Lilith held Paul by the hand and they went into the store and got on an elevator . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the women 's department and into the girl 's department . <p> A pleasant looking middle-age saleslady came over to them . " Im Deborah . Can I help you ? " she asked . <p> " Yes thank you , " said Lilith . " I need to get my nephew a new wardrobe . He needs everything : panties , bouffant slips , dresses and socks and shoes . Youll have to take his measurements first since I 'm not sure of his size . " <p> " Certainly , " said Deborah , " and I 'll check his shoe size also . " <p> " Aunty , I 'm not a girl , " said a puzzled Paul . " Why ... " <p> " Just be nice and quiet sweetheart , " said Lilith cutting him short , " and I 'll explain it to you when we get home . " <p> Paul obeyed his pretty aunty like a good boy , but he started to feel sort of scared . <p> It did n't  surprise Deborah that Lilith was buying girls clothes for a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately . She thought it was probably because of a wonderful club shed heard about . She quickly took Pauls measurements with her tape measure and checked his height , then had him sit down and measured his foot for his shoe size as well . <p> " Hell take a girls size seven dress and things except for his shoes , " said Deborah . " Where would you like to start ? " <p> " Panties first , " answered Lilith . <p> Deborah took them to a tabletop display of loose panties in smooth plastic bins , each bin numbered according to the size of the panties in it . <p> " Let me have a dozen panties for him , " said Lilith , " the lacy nylon tricot rumba panties with the rows of ruffled white lace across the back of them and lace around the leg openings in an assortment of pastel colors and , some white ones also . Later in the year well get him some thicker cotton panties and some petti-panties and tights for the cold weather . " <p> Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , those are pretty , " said Lilith . " Let 's move on to the bouffant slips . " <p> There were four long racks of bouffant slips for little girls , hung in order of size . Deborah showed Lilith where the girls size seven slips were . Lilith picked out three multi-layered white ones , three in pink , and one each in pastel yellow and lilac . Most of them had a tricot bodice , a smooth nylon parchment underskirt holding out a layer of stiff white nylon netting in three widening tiers , and with white binding on the edges of its bottom four layers of nylon net ruffles . <p> Sally had gone off by herself to buy some things for him to play with when they were home . <p> When Lilith had picked out the bouffant slips she wanted for the little boy , Deborah took them from her , brought them and his panties to the counter where the cash register was , and returned to Lilith . <p> " Let me have two pairs of the shiny black Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes that also have a strap and buckle , " said Lilith . <p> " Since its spring now , he should be wearing white shoes . Well save his Mary Janes for autumn and winter and get him some flats when he s a little older . Youd better include another pair of both colors a half size larger . Children grow so fast . " <p> " Now for his socks , " said Lilith . " Be sure they 're mostly pastel colors thatll go with his little dresses , but include some of those cute white ones that have the little flowers and the lace collar on them to fold down over the top of his shoes . " <p> Again Deborah brought everything Lilith was picking out to the cash register , then returned to her . <p> " Let 's go to the dresses now , " said Lilith . " I want some pretty every day sort of dresses he can play in , and some especially pretty ones for the weekends . We usually have visitors then . " <p> Soon Lilith had picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , " suggested Deborah , " we have some darling mother and daughter dress sets . Would you like to see them ? " <p> " By all means , " said Lilith . " I 'd like seeing him wearing a pretty little dress that looks like mine . And all little girls like to wear a pretty dress that looks like their mommys dress , in this case his auntys , dress . " <p> Deborah led the way to two racks of the mother and daughter-dresses . One rack held the dresses in mothers sizes , and the other rack had the look-alike dresses in sizes for their little girls . <p> Lilith chose a set in pink gingham , another in lilac gingham , and a red set with tiny white polka dots . She also picked out three other different sets in Sallys considerably <p> larger size around her bust and slightly larger waist . All of the dresses she had picked out for Paul were soft cotton and buttoned up at the back , had a cute little white secretary collar with dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding , and a white sash for his waist . <p> Remembering a newspaper ad shes seen recently , she also picked out a little pink poodle skirt and two button back white blouses with an eyelet lace bordered bodice , a lace trimmed collar and with lace trim on the short puffed sleeves . <p> " Take the price tags off everything and add them up , " said Lilith , " and I 'll take the pink gingham set of dresses , a white bouffant slip , a pair of his pink rumba panties , a pink pair of socks and the pair of the white shoes . You can take the rest of his things to the cash register while we try on the dresses to make sure they fit , " said Lilith as she took Paul by the hand . She led him off to the dressing rooms with the pink gingham mother and daughter dresses with the rest of his little girl things . Paul was too confused and afraid to say anything ; Aunty and Gramma were pretty ladies , but a lot taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his clothes . Then she held open the pink rumba panties trimmed with white lace around the leg openings and in ruffled rows across the back of them . He stepped into them when she told him to , and Lilith drew the elastic waistband up in place . It made Paul feel squirmy to be wearing lacy panties like girls wore . <p> " Now put your arms up high , Paul , " said Lilith as she gathered the four bottom ruffles of the bouffant slip in her hands and held it over him . <p> Paul was terrified when he saw the layers of ruffles over his head and Auntys unsmiling face above it . It was a girl thing coming down over him as the adjustable straps settled on his shoulders . Next he had to put his hands in front of him when Lilith brought the little pink gingham dress down on him , so he could put his hands and arms through the short puffed sleeves . Then she turned him around and buttoned up the back of it and tied the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist with the bow having long tag ends . His dress and his bouffant slip ended at the same level at the top of his knees . <p> Lilith was beginning to enjoy dressing the little boy like a girl . She had no doubt she and Sally could make the little boy a sissy in a week or less . Being such an extreme feminist , it would be very satisfying to her to make him a sissy and see him looking and behaving like a good little girl . <p> " Sit down on the little seat , Paul , and I 'll put your socks and shoes on you , " Lilith told him . <p> Once Lilith had Paul dressed like a little girl , she changed into her part of the mother and daughter dress set , her own three white petticoats poufing it out nicely . <p> Outside the dressing room , she dropped Pauls boys clothes , including his favorite belt with its Roy Rogers cowboy buckle , and his sneakers in a rubbish barrel , to be thrown away by the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out to a tall mirror in the dress department . <p> " See how nice my little girl looks now ? Smile pretty sweetheart , " said Lilith , a satisfied expression on her face as she held him around the waist . <p> Hell look like a pretty little girl when Francines finished with his hair , she thought . <p> When Paul saw himself in the mirror , he hardly felt like smiling . Even on Halloween hed never dared to dress like a girl - and next Halloween was still almost seven months away . <p> They went to the cash register , where Deborah was waiting for them . Lilith wrote a check for her purchases , then took Paul back to the elevator . Along the way , she stopped and paid cash for a shiny white little pocketbook with a shoulder strap , and a pair of pretty white cloth gloves for a little girl , just like the gloves she and Sally were wearing except for their smaller size . She placed both items on him . <p> " Keep your left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wont swing around when you walk , " instructed Lilith . " Do n't  swing your right arm . Just keep it along the side of your dress when you 're walking . " <p> Four salesgirls took everything down to her car once the dresses Lilith had bought for Paul and the dress shed worn to the store had been boxed , the rest of his things put in some of the stores large paper bags , the ruffled bottom edges of his other bouffant slips sticking out a little from the top of them , and placed them on the back seat . Sally was already in the car with a couple more large paper bags shed also put on the back seat . <p> They got into the front seat again and Lilith drove down the street to FRANCINES , the beauty salon that she and Sally occasionally visited to get their hair style changed or permed . <p> " Do n't  you look nice sweetheart ! " said Sally , smiling at the little boy . <p> When they got out of the car , Lilith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dresses again . Then Lilith held Paul by the hand as they went up the steps into FRANCINES . Sally noticed that Pauls bouffant slip whispered in a delightful way against the skirts of his little dress when he walked , like Liliths and her own petticoats did , but rustled in a more noticeable manner than his . <p> Francine paused in her work on a womans hair when she heard them enter . <p> " Well ! Is this the little boy Sally phoned me about , the one that 's going to be your little girl ? " asked Francine as she smiled at Paul . " Mother and daughter dresses ! Does n't  he look darling . I bet he loves wearing a pretty dress that looks like his auntys dress . And his cute little white pocketbook and white gloves make him look like a proper little lady with matching accessories . " <p> " I 'm his foster mother now and hell be my little girl from now on , " replied Lilith . " You know how Sally and I feel about boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl .

Sit down and I 'll be with you in a couple of minutes . " <p> They went over to some padded chairs along the wall and Lilith told him , " Paul , watch the way Gramma sits down . " <p> Sally placed her hands behind her and smoothed her dress , petticoats and half slip under her as she sat down on the chair behind her . <p> " Now you sit down the same way , " instructed Lilith . <p> Paul sat down like Gramma had done and Lilith sat down on his other side . Besides ladies , hed seen that the little girls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Always remember to sit down that way sweetheart , " said Sally as she smiled at him , " so you wo n't get wrinkles in your poufy slip and pretty dress . That 's how good little girls sit down . " <p> Paul began looking around at the things in the scary place . There was a row of chairs at the back of the room with big helmets over them - he wondered what they were for . They looked like the space helmets in the Buck Rogers comic books that hed read at the child center . <p> Soon Catherine got up from the styling chair , then paid , tipped and thanked Francine , and said goodbye , after giving her dress and petticoats a rustling shake in front of a full-length mirror next to the door to pouf them up nicely . <p> " Your turn , precious , " Francine told Paul , and Sally took his gloves off him and held them and his little pocket book for him . <p> Lilith gave Paul a little push up from his chair and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the styling chair with two thick pads on it she used to raise the level of the little girls whose hair she styled or permed . Then she tied a sheet ( the type barbers use ) around his neck to keep any cut hair from getting on his pretty dress . <p> " Did he just have a shampoo ? " asked Francine as she smelled his hair . <p> " Yes , I gave him a shampoo and a bubble bath before we came , " replied Lilith . <p> " Lilith , you and Sally will love having a little sissy living with you , " said Francine . " I 've already got my own little nephew wearing panties , bouffant slips and dresses . He s staying with me while his stepmother is spending this year in Europe , and he loves being a little girl now . Ill only be here for another week so I can stay with him while he s here . Today the lady next door to me is baby-sitting him for me while he plays hop scotch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their hair will have to call and make an appointment two days in advance so I can arrange to get a sitter for him . Ive trained a couple of new hairdressers to handle my other customers . " <p> " You mean you actually like having him with you ? " asked Lilith , irritated by the thought of now having to train Paul to behave like a good little girl . <p> " I love it , Lilith , " answered Francine , " and you 'll love it too . You 'll see . Making a little boy a sissy is so much fun . And it makes me feel good to see him fluffing up his bouffant slip and dress , brushing away wrinkles in his dress with his hands , asking me to retie the bow on his hair , and keeping himself nice and clean like the little girls in my neighborhood do . Having a prissy little sissy living with me is even more fun than having a real little girl . Take my word for it . " <p> " Perhaps for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Family Court forced on us . " <p> " Oh , Lilith , " said Sally , " forget about that . Ill love having a prissy little granddaughter now . All little girls like to keep their dresses looking nice by fluffing them up now and then , and they always keep themselves nice and clean , even when they play together . " <p> While they had been talking , Francine cut some bangs on his forehead and brought the rest of his long blond hair back and up from his neck and trimmed it a little , making a seven inch long ponytail beginning high on the back of his head , having a little upward flip at the end of it . She tied a two inch wide pink ribbon to go with his pink gingham dress around the beginning of his ponytail in a big pretty bow , with the tag ends of the pert bow hanging down a few inches . <p> " There . That looks pretty , " said Francine . " Pink looks so nice on blond hair . Lilith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little with my tweezers , then I 'll pierce his earlobes . Ill put some sterilized gold plated studs in them for now . Leave them in overnight , and tomorrow you can put some little pearl studs in them I 'll give you as a present for him . Hell like having pierced ears like his pretty aunty and gramma have , and having pierced ears will be a sort of semi-permanent badge of his little girl femininity . Then I 'll put some bright pink lipstick on him to go with his pretty dress . " <p> Paul did n't  know what the word pierce meant . Once his neck was shielded with a towel , she held one of his earlobes away from his neck and numbed it with a thin spray of cold carbon dioxide gas from a pressurized can and pierced it with a spring powered needle device in Francines other hand . Then she pierced the other earlobe and placed the gold plated studs in them . Next she showed him how to keep his lower lip taut while she coated it with the pink lipstick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upper lip also . <p> " All done sweetheart , " said Francine , smiling at the pretty little sissy-to-be , then blotted her lipstick on a tissue and lifted him down from the styling chair . Once Paul was standing on the floor , she bent down , gave him a hug and kissed him on the cheek . <p> " Be a good little girl for your nice aunty and gramma now , precious , " she told him , smiling at how much he looked liked a pretty little girl now . It was one of Francines typical pretty results for little boys being made sissies by domineering divorced mothers , step-mothers or aunts . <p> Lilith came over and paid Francine , included a lavish tip and thanked her . <p> " Thanks Lilith , " said Francine . " By the way , this is the tenth little sissy I 've given girls hair style this month . This is why . Here , take this . " Francine gave Lilith a business card . <p> Lilith read the business card with considerable interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . She handed it back to Lilith and she put it in her pocketbook , along with the pearl ear studs Francine had given her for Paul to wear . <p> LADIES PETTICOATING &amp; GIRLS-in-TRAINING CLUB <p> Call FelicitT at 555-GIRL for information &amp; meeting schedule . <p> Only women , sissies and older sisters of sissies allowed . <p> Complimentary hair bow and Girltalk dictionary for new sissies . <p> New members welcomed.Dont wait.Call today . <p> " Thanks Fran , " said Lilith , as she put the card and the pearl ear studs Francine had given her in her pocketbook . " Its interesting . Sally and I will call about the club later this month after Nancys learned to behave like a good little girl . " <p> " Nancy ! What a nice name for a pretty little sissy , " said Francine , with a sweet smile at Paul . <p> Sally took Paul by the hand after shed put his white cloth gloves back on him and hung his cute little pocketbook on his left shoulder again . Then they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and Lilith drove them back home . Along the way Sally primped the bow on his ponytail . <p> " Isnt it nice it is to be a pretty little girl now , sweetheart ? " Sally asked the little boy . " Now you can have lots of fun playing hop-scotch and jacks , and jumping rope with the other little girls that live near us . " <p> Paul still had n't  seen what his hair looked like now . Francine had swiveled the styling chair away from the mirror as a precaution to keep him from trying to jump out of it if he saw himself like some other little boys had tried to do . But he had felt his ponytail bumping softly against the back of his head and neck when theyd walked back to the car . <p> Lilith parked the car under the porte cochere in case it rained again during the night . They entered the side door and went down the hallway to the living room , pausing along the way as Paul looked at his reflection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl - every normal little boys most feared fate was just beginning . Hed have a little girls ponytail and bangs , and be wearing lipstick and dresses every day now , along with the other pretty things girls wear under their dresses . And hed be taught to behave and play like a good little girl with the little girls and some other girly sissies that would soon be his only friends . <p> It had taken Liliths two maids several trips to her car to bring his new clothes up to his room before they left for their weekend off , while Lilith , Sally and Paul had gone into the living room . <p> " Now that were home , Gramma and I have something nice to tell you Paul , " Lilith told him . " Come sit on the couch between Gramma and me " . <p> Paul went to the couch and sat down between them . <p> " No no , sweetheart . " said Sally . " You forgot to put your hands behind you and smooth your dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it now , precious . " <p> Paul stood up and sat down again , smoothing his little dress and his bouffant slip with its four bottom layers of poufy nylon net ruffles under him like hed seen the girls at school do . <p> " Thats a good girl , " said Sally as she placed an arm around his shoulders , tugged him to her side and kissed him on the cheek . <p> " Paul , " began Lilith , " you 're going to be my little girl now , and from now on your name is Nancy . That was my grandmothers name , and its a nice name for a pretty little girl . " <p> " But I do n't  wan na be a girl , " said the boy . <p> " After a while you will , " said Lilith . " But the boys wont call you a sissy and laugh at you if you behave like a good little girl . You 're very lucky , Nancy . You look like a pretty little girl now . And Gramma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good little girl . Do n't  be afraid Nancy . Soon you 'll love wearing dresses and having fun playing with the little girls that live near us . And someday when you 're older , a nice doctor lady will make you a real girl . " <p> " Wont that be nice sweetheart ? " said Sally . " Girls have lots more fun than boys do . And in a few years you 'll be a real girl , and grow up to be a pretty lady . " <p> " Until then Nancy , always do what Gramma and I teach you to do . " Lilith told him . " Keep your room looking nice . Good little girls do n't  leave the clothes they wore for the day lying around . Well drop the socks and panties you wore for the day down the laundry chute when you go to bed . Little girls wear fresh panties and socks every day . You cant reach the bar in the closet to hang up your dress and bouffant slip , so Gramma or I will hang them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick little supper now , " said Sally . " The Disney CINDERELLA movie is coming on television in a little while . Nancy will love seeing Cinderella in her pretty gown . " <p> " Yes , " said Lilith. " thatll be a nice movie for our little girl to watch . " <p> From now on , Lilith would usually call him Nancy , though sometimes shed lose her patience and call him " sissy boy " when he did n't  do things the way little girls do . But Sally always called him Nancy . Sally agreed with what Francine had said . It was so nice to have a cute little sissy living with them , and having him be her darling little granddaughter now . <p> They went back into the kitchen and Sally made a salad and small meal for them . When they began eating , Lilith and Sally taught Nancy how to hold his fork properly like girls and ladies do , and not make a fist around it like boys do . <p> " Cut all your food before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your napkin in your lap sweetheart , " instructed Sally . " Sit up nice and straight Nancy . Good little girls do n't  bend their face over their plate like naughty boys do , but you can lean a little closer when you bring your fork to your mouth . " <p> " Lilith , while we were in the store , " said Sally , " I bought some things for Nancy to play with , and some pretty nighties , too . She behaved like a good little girl today at the store and at Francines beauty salon . " I 'll bring her play things downstairs from my room for her . " <p> " Good thinking Mother , " replied Lilith . " I was so busy getting her dresses and things I forgot about getting her some pretty nighties and a doll and things to play with . Well wait for you in the living room now that we 've finished eating ; I 'll do the dishes , since the maids have left . I really cant see why they wont work a sixteen hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them overtime when they do when we expect visitors in the evening . I 'm beginning to think letting them have the weekends off was a bad idea . Its hard to get good domestics these days . " <p> A few minutes later , Nancy was sitting on the living room couch next to Lilith after shed turned on the television set . Soon Sally came downstairs and sat next to Nancy on his other side with a rustling of her skirts and petticoats . She began taking some things from the two large paper bags from the store . <p> The first item was a box with a Little Susy magic skin doll with cute little pink socks , little white baby shoes , a miniature bouffant slip , extra dresses and snap fastening diapers . She opened the box and showed the doll to her darling sissy granddaughter . <p> " Isnt she nice , Nancy ? " said Sally . " You can hold the little magic bottle to her mouth and see her drink her milk . And you can change her diaper , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items were a soft rag doll in panties and a little dress , yellow yarn pigtails , their ends tied with little pink ribbon bows , a coloring book for a little girl , a big box of crayons , three books of press-out paper dolls with little panties , poufy slips and dresses . The last items were some pretty jig-saw puzzles for a little girl , a jump rope and game of jacks . <p> " You can leave them in this room so you can play with them during the day , Nancy , " Sally told him , " but take your nice soft doll up to bed with you so you can hug her while you 're sleeping . " <p> In a few days Lilith would smile in satisfaction whenever she saw Nancy playing with his paper dolls , knowing she and Sally were succeeding in making him a sissy . <p> Then the CINDERELLA movie came on , and soon Nancy became so absorbed in watching it , he forgot how different in a strange sort of nice way it made him feel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind had been broken - it was the classic " fatal flaw " of ancient Greek plays . Soon the boy would like wearing girls clothes and doing lots of other things little girls do as he became more and more sissified . <p> When a commercial came on , Sally got up , went to the kitchen and returned with a tray with two small glasses of sherry on it for her and Lilith , and a glass of 7-UP with a couple of straws in it for Nancy . Nancy noticed that some of his pink lipstick came off on the straws . <p> During the next commercial , Lilith went to the downstairs bathroom to freshen up . When she sat down on the couch again , Nancy said he had to pee . <p> " Oh , do n't  say pee Nancy . That does n't  sound nice sweetheart . Come with me , " Sally told him . " Ill show you how little girls freshen up sweetheart . That 's what ladies and girls say when they have to go potty or put on fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom and Sally told him , " Just stand in front of the johnny with your back to it , and reach up under your dress and slip and pull your panties down onto your legs . That 's it Nancy . Now hold up the back of your dress and petticoat and sit down . This is how girls and ladies freshen up , Nancy . " <p> " If you wish , Mother , " replied Lilith , aware of her mothers obvious delight with having a little sissy for a granddaughter . <p> Sally held Nancy by the hand and they went upstairs and into the bathroom at the end of the hallway . On the wall along the stairs they had passed by a big gilt- framed old photograph enlargements of their ancestor women in the Meene family line , either in Victorian big hoop-skirt dresses , or long dresses during the Edwardian years that had a short train held out by a bustle under the dress . As was the custom for photographs back in the earlier time , none of the women were smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First Sally wiped his lipstick off with a Kleenex and put some cold cream on his face , then wiped the excess off with another tissue so it would n't get on his lace-trimmed pillow cases . But some of it had sunk into his skin to keep it soft , smooth and pretty looking . Then she had him brush his teeth and rinse his mouth with some mouthwash . Next he pulled his panties down on his legs and sat down on the toilet seat , holding the back of his dress and slip up in back of him and freshened up , then held his dress and bouffant slip up in back of him again as he wiped his bum with some soft toilet paper ( usually called bathroom paper by ladies ) . Then Sally had him wash his hands good . <p> When they were done in the bathroom , she took him into his bedroom and untied the bow on his ponytail , then helped him take off his dress and bouffant slip , hung them in his big closet , and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty canopy bed . <p> Beside the things little girls play with , Sally had also bought him four pretty nighties to wear . She put a pink soft cotton flannel one on him now . It went down to his ankles and had a small lace trimmed collar . Little flowers were on its white eyelet lace bordered bodice . <p> " Come sit on my lap sweetheart , " said Sally as she sat down on the edge of his bed , lifted him onto her lap , gave him a hug and kissed him on the cheek . " Now I 'll read our little girl a nice bedtime story . " <p> It took Sally only ten minutes to read Goldilocks and The Three Bears to her darling little sissy granddaughter . Then he got into his pretty bed and Sally bent down , tucked him in and kissed him on the cheek . <p> " Pretty dreams sweetheart , " said Sally , then left , turning off the light , though some moonlight came through the starched ruffle edged white linen curtains , while Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear . <p> She went back downstairs to the living room and sat on the couch near Lilith . <p> " Lilith , Nancy looks like such a cute little girl ... " said Sally . " I could just hug him and kiss his little rosy cheeks all day when he sits on my lap . I 'm so glad he lives with us now . I 'll go to White Plains later this month and buy him the prettiest little dresses I can find . And I 'll put some new film in my camera and more film and flash-bulbs in my photographers shoulder bag tomorrow . He looks like such a pretty little girl with his bangs and pony tail and wearing a pretty little dress . Its so nice making him a sissy and teaching him behave like a good little girl . " <p> Photography was Sallys hobby . She had a complete darkroom set up in the cellar that had the usual dull red light , rubber gloves , a rubber apron , trays for the developing and fixing fluids for the films negatives , a sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang on a wall as well as smaller pictures to keep in her new photo album . An enthusiastic almost professional grade photographer , Sally usually kept her camera nearby for taking some nice candid pictures . <p> " I have to admit that he really does look like a pretty little girl now , " replied Lilith . " Things could have been a lot worse . Fortunately , he did n't  turn out to be some homely little monster of a boy . But with some more training by us and having him play with the little girls in our neighborhood , hell begin to behave and act like real little girls do . And he looks so much like a pretty little girl I 'm sure the boys in our neighborhood wont know he s a sissy , unless some mother tells them . A little spanking now and then will put an end to any boyish behavior . " <p> " Oh , do n't  spank him Lilith , " said Sally . " Hell be a good little girl . Besides , you 'll catch more flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for being a good girl will make him happy he s our little girl now . " <p> " Mother , no doubt affection will work to some extent , " said Lilith , " but even real little girls have to be disciplined now and then . Well see how he behaves when our company arrives around ten thirty tomorrow morning . While you were upstairs , I received a phone call . Jane Belmore and her cute little sissy Charlene will be visiting us along with several other ladies that are friends of ours . " <p> " I 'll teach him how to curtsey in the morning before they get here , " said Sally . <p> " Yes , there 's a lot more little girl training well have to give him , " said Lilith . <p> NEXT MORNING ... <p> People only remember the dreams they have just before they wake up , though sometimes a nightmare will wake them in the middle of the night . Nancy was having a dream of himself wearing his girls clothes and walking down a street between Aunty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were near the sidewalk with mannequins of little girls in them wearing examples of dresses and bouffant slips the stores sold , and all the boys from the Child Welfare Center were on the street , pointing at him and laughing . He stuck his tongue out at the boys , and Gramma told him good little girls do n't  do that . <p> He woke up when Sally kissed him on the cheek . <p> " Time to get up , sleepyhead , " said Sally . " We have a lot to do this morning . Some nice ladies phoned last night and will be visiting us today . We want our little girl to look nice and pretty for them . Put on your little housecoat and white slippers , and come downstairs with me now for breakfast . " <p> Nancys little girl size housecoat was like a bathrobe , but was made of a smooth cotton/nylon blend covered with flowers printed on it , had a larger lace trimmed collar than his nightie , and a soft cloth self-belt to keep it closed that Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to always close his left side first and then the right side over it like girls and ladies do . <p> Then she held him by the hand and they went downstairs for breakfast . <p> Sally was already dressed , and had her bra , garter belt and panties on , nylon stockings and four inch high heels , a full length slip and a couple of new stiff petticoats under her pretty dress . As the days would go by , Nancy would often see Aunty and Gramma in various stages of undress in the morning till they finished dressing for the day . <p> They went into the kitchen and Nancy remembered to put his hands behind him and smoothed his little housecoat and nightie under him as he sat down at the kitchen table next to Sally . <p> " See Lilith ? " said Sally , smiling lovingly at him . " Nancy does things now just like other little girls do . " <p> Lilith was standing at the stove frying bacon and eggs , still wearing her very sheer black nylon peignoir with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomy sleeves of its diaphanous robe were pushed up as she cooked breakfast . <p> When Lilith heard Sally , she looked over at Nancy with a smile . Being such an extreme feminist , she found making a little boy a sissy was a very satisfying thing to be doing . <p> " Did our little girl have a nice sleep ? " Lilith asked him . <p> " Sort of Aunty . " answered Nancy . " Gramma said some ladies are coming to visit you today . " <p> " Yes Nancy , " said Lilith . " Be a good little girl when they 're here . You would n't want me to have to spank you after they leave . Would you ? " <p> " No . Please Aunty , " answered Nancy , scared of getting a spanking , " I 'll be a good girl . " <p> " Maybe after a while you and the little girl thatll be with her mommy can go outside on the patio in back and play hop-scotch , " Sally told him . " The other little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than boys do . Now let 's finish our breakfast and then well go back upstairs and I 'll give you your bubble bath before I dress you up nice and pretty for the day . " <p> " But Gramma , I just had a bubble bath yesterday , " said Nancy . <p> " Little girls have a bubble bath every day sweetheart , " said Sally . " Then they smell nice and pretty all day . Aunty and I take a shower every morning and use powder and perfume to make us smell pretty . " <p> Nancy was beginning a routine hed be doing every morning . When theyd finished their breakfast , while Lilith washed the breakfast dishes , Sally would take him back upstairs and have him freshen up , then wash his hands , and Sally would give him his pretty smelling bubble bath and have him brush his teeth and rinse his mouth and gargle with some mouthwash . Then it was into his bedroom and hed be dressed up pretty for the day . <p> Sally loved the new bouffant style for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his bouffant slips were so pretty . And his part of the **27;631;TOOLONG theyd bought made him look like Liliths cute little girl and her own darling little grand daughter that shed always wanted to have . <p> First Sally pinned his long hair on top of his head with some bobby pins to keep it out of the way . Today Lilith wanted him to wear his part of the of the pink gingham dress set and the lacy white bouffant slip hed worn just for the afternoon and evening before . Now Lilith was also putting on her part of the set for the day . She could hardly wait for the other ladies to see how cute her little sissy looked in a pretty little dress that was a darling little copy of her own dress . <p> After she had put his lacy panties and bouffant slip on him , Nancy looked at his bouffant slip in the tall mirror on the back of his bedroom wall and smiled . <p> Next she put his pink gingham dress on him , tying the white sash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Are n't  dresses nice , Nancy , " said Sally , a statement rather than a question . " You 'll always wear lacy panties , poufy slips and pretty dresses from now on . Little girls are a lot happier than little boys are because all their clothes are so pretty . And do n't  be afraid of the other little girls . Remember sweetheart , good little girls do n't  fight when they play together . " <p> " I like being a girl now , Gramma , " said Nancy with a little smile , in his childs innocence about the sexes thinking he really was a girl now . <p> Nancy had n't  been a sissy before , but now he was beginning to like being a little girl and wearing his lacy panties , poufy slips and dresses . It was every normal little boys biggest fear : to have to wear girls ' clothes ! But it felt nice to him now that Lilith and Sally were making him a sissy . He liked the big pink bow on his ponytail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You wont be playing with boys anymore , " said Sally as she stood behind him , " just with other little girls . Our little girl will have lots of fun now . " <p> " I will , Gramma ? " he asked . <p> " Yes sweetheart , " replied Sally . " and someday a nice doctor lady will make you even more of a girl when you 're older . But be a good little girl till then . " <p> " Yes Gramma . I will , " he replied with his cute smile , then asked , " When I get big , will I be a pretty lady like you and Aunty are ? " <p> " Oh , I think you 'll be prettier than we are , " said Sally . " Now I 'll tie up your ponytail and brush your bangs down . Then I 'll put your lipstick and some nail polish on you , and the little pearls in your ears in before we go back downstairs . " <p> " Yes Gramma , " said Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sissy that liked to wear girls clothes , looking pretty and playing with little girls and other sissies . <p> After a pink lipstick was on him and his fingernails coated with a pink nail polish , his bangs brushed down and his ponytail tied up with a big pink ribbon bow again and had the little pearls in his earlobes , Sally held him by the hand and they went back downstairs , Sallys petticoats and dress and Nancys little bouffant slip and dress whispering against each others . Nancys pretty little dress ended at the top of his knees , and the bottom ruffles of his pretty bouffant slip ended at the same level and made his little dress look so nice and poufy when he was standing next to her . <p> When they reached the kitchen again , Lilith had just taken off her apron and yellow rubber gloves after having washed the dishes as she grumbled to herself about the absent servants . But she smiled now at their little sissy in a dress like her own again . She bent down to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . <p> " Aunty , " said Nancy with his happy smile , " my dress looks like yours again . " <p> " I knew our little girl would like that Nancy , " replied Lilith . " All little girls like to wear a pretty dress that looks like their mommys or auntys dress . " <p> " And if you 're a good little girl , you can wear a dress like mine sweetheart , " Sally told him and kissed him on the cheek . <p> " I 'll be a good girl Gramma , " said Nancy with a little smile . It felt nice to wear girls clothes and have Aunty and Gramma giving him hugs and kissing his cheeks . <p> Now Nancy liked wearing girls clothes , not that he had any choice about it . In the days ahead , Lilith and Sally would turn him into even more of the darling little sissy they wanted him to be . Soon while other little boys played with their Lionel trains or played cowboy , shooting their cap pistols at pretend Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she taught him how to crochet doilies or helped him with his paper dolls . At other times , Lilith would sit next to him as she showed him pictures of dresses and the other pretty things little girls wear in the catalogs that had been brought to them by THE LITTLE PRINCESS DRESS SHOP and another shop for little girls named SUGAR N SPICE . Francine had called them and asked to have someone bring their catalogs to Liliths home . In return , Francine would receive a small commission on whatever Lilith or Sally bought for Nancy to wear . FRANCINES had become the favorite beauty salon of quite a large number of other women that had little boys they like to turn into sissies by keeping them in girls clothes and teaching them to behave and play like good little girls . <p> " Let 's go into the front parlor now sweetheart , " said Sally . " While well wait for our visitors , I 'll show you how to curtsey and read our little girl a nice story . Tomorrow Nancy I 'll get you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice stories and puzzles for little girls in it . " <p> They went into the front parlor and Sally showed him how to make a curtsey , then had him practice it a few times before they sat down on the loveseat , and Sally read him the story of Little Red Riding Hood . Later in the day when he played by himself , since he did n't  have any toys that boys played with , he began to play with his doll and some of the other things little girls play with , this time with his crayons as he carefully colored in some pictures of little kitties in his coloring book for little girls . <p> The front parlor was actually the drawing room in the Victorian manner for having tea or sherry as they talked with visiting ladies . It did n't  have a television set in it . Instead of the cushier chairs and couch in the living room , the chairs were all upholstered in a shiny tightly woven ecru fabric , with roses and violets embroidered on the padded seat and backrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves to the legs and the rest of their frames . The Victorian loveseat and long couch with its backrest curving up higher on one end were made the same way . A lamp with big double globes , one above the other with big roses painted on them , was on a small table in front of the window . Tiffany lamps with a clear glass chimney going up through an upside down cone shaped shade made from different colored pieces of glass in the shape of flowers held together with thin iron veining were on the end tables . Thick maroon velvet floor-length drapes were at the side of the windows to cut down winter drafts , and lace curtains with starched white linen ruffles at their edges hung across the windows to prevent too much direct sunlight that could fade the colors of the Persian carpets and upholstery . During a storm , the wooden shutters outside along the windows could be cranked closed from inside , and latched to keep them from being blown open by the wind . Most Victorian houses did n't  have insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for heat . But Lilith had had a contractor blow insulation into the outside walls with a special machine to save heat during the cold New York winters , and a modern heating system installed . <p> The interior of all Victorian houses had a definitely feminine atmosphere and charm to them . Liliths maids , Gloria LaChance and Grace Peebles , interviewed carefully before they were hired , were other extreme feminists , and feather dusted everything . They also gently used a vacuum cleaner on the rugs , polished the fancy woodwork and wound up the mantle clocks over the mansions fireplaces and pulled down one of the weights of the tall grandfathers clock in the corner to keep it wound up . Only the heating and kitchen had been modernized with a refrigerator and gas stove for cooking . Nancy had been told to never never touch the knobs on the stove , and both Sally and Lilith always checked to be sure they were turned off , but its pilot light was still lit after they finished cooking and before going to bed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , considering it to be unhealthy , and definitely unladylike . <p> Liliths maids thought Nancy was a darling little sissy , but kept a distant manner towards him , knowing Lilith would n't want them interfering with her own ideas and methods of making him a sissy and teaching him to behave like a good little girl . <p> In fact Lilith expected them to do their work in the house quietly and efficiently without any unnecessary talking or any laughter . Gloria and Grace entered and left by the tradesmens entrance at the back of the house near the mud room with its ladies high-heeled boots and fur collared high heeled overshoes . Lilith expected them to be seen and not heard unless she had pulled one of the tasseled bell cords in the house to summon them , and to have them make a little curtsey when one of them came , and leave once she told them what she wanted . <p> Artwork of different types filled the drawing room and living room . Small hand painted porcelain figurines of ladies in eighteenth century dresses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantle clock over the drawing rooms fireplace and on the window table near the double globe lamp . Todays interior decorators consider Victorian homes to have been too cluttered with knick-knacks , but they did give a feminine sentiment , charm and atmosphere to Victorian mansions like Liliths had . The front door had two tall slim windows with a lacy design etched on the glass , and above the door there was a fan shape sunburst window with a yellow glass sun at the top , and different colored vanes of glass slanting down between narrow wooden frames like the suns rays . <p> Inside to the left of the front door was another door that led down a hallway with some small rooms off it to a large ballroom with a Steinway piano on a bandstand platform . Though the ballroom had n't  been used in years , when Nancy had his next birthday , Lilith had already decided to use the ballroom to hold his party in it after shed had the maids dust and clean it . For now the piano , chairs and couches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just as Sally finished reading him the story , the front doors old fashion mechanical bell key had been twisted . Sally had Nancy stand up next to her and held him by the hand as they waited for their visitors to come into the parlor . <p> Lilith had opened the door and was greeting a group of visiting ladies . Their visitors were all wealthy women , though not to the enormous degree of the Meene family women . All of them were divorced or widowed mothers , step-mothers or aunts . They all came into the parlor and Sally told Nancy to say hello . <p> He pinched the sides of his little dress and bouffant slip together and held them out away from his legs , put one leg in back of the other and bent his knees a little as he made a curtsey like Sally had taught him earlier that morning and said , " Hello . Im Nancy Meene . Its nice to meet you . " <p> Sally and Lilith smiled in approval at how nice he curtseyed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what he thought was a little girl about his age with one of the ladies . <p> " What a darling little girl ! " said Betsy Whateley as she smiled at Nancy . <p> " This is Charlene. " said Jane Belmore to the other ladies . " She used to be my little boy Charles , but I decided to have him be my little girl . " <p> Charlene smiled and curtsied like Nancy had done and said hello . <p> " Shes such a pretty little girl , " said Lilith . " She must make you very happy . Let 's all sit down now and you can tell me the latest gossip . " <p> Their visitors all tittered since proper ladies werent supposed to gossip , though actually they all did . <p> They all placed their hands behind them and smoothed their dresses , petticoats and slips under them , making a considerable rustling noise as they sat down . <p> " Lilith , " said Betsy , " Im surprised . I thought I heard that you had become the foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was , " replied Lilith . " But he s too cute to let him be a boy . Sally and I think he should be my little girl instead . Besides , you know how Sally and I feel about boys . But she 's happy she 's my little girl now . Are n't  you Nancy ? " <p> " Mother and daughter dresses ! " said Irene Hills , owner of Hills Horse Meat Company for dog food , but also eaten by poor people . " Isnt that sweet . And what a nice way of encouraging Nancy to be a pretty little girl . " <p> The visiting women all got up and came over to the loveseat where Lilith was sitting with an arm around Nancy to get a closer look at him . Lilith gave him a little push onto his feet and he began getting hugs and kisses on his cheeks from all of them as they told him how pretty his dress was . Unlike normal little boys , Nancy smiled and giggled , liking it when they bent down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wonderful Lilith , " said Jane . " Now Charlene will have another little girl she can play with . " <p> " Yes , " said Lilith . " Bring Charlene over any afternoon . If the weathers nice , and they can play hop-scotch and jump rope on the patio , or play jacks inside if its raining while we discuss what 's going on around town . Just phone first to make sure were home . Nancy , give Charlene a nice kiss on the lips now . " <p> She gave Nancy a little push onto his feet again , and the two sissies came up to each other and leaned forward a little with their hands a little way from the side of their dresses for balance and kissed , while the women smiled and made gushy feminine comments on how precious they were . <p> Sallys camera had flashed just as the two sissies kissed . Soon shed make big enlargements of the picture to hang in her and Liliths bedrooms , as well as another big copy for Nancys bedroom . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you and Charlene are girlfriends and can play together . " <p> " Yes Gramma , " answered Nancy as he smiled prettily . The boy liked being a little girl now . He was already on the slippery downward slope to even more sissy things hed like doing , and already had a little girls prissy manner as he fussed with the skirts of his little dress and bouffant slip when he was sitting on the love seat , fluffing them up and brushing away any wrinkles on his dress with his hands , and keeping himself nice and clean during the day . <p> " Nancy , you and Charlene can go outside in back and play hop scotch while Gramma and I talk with the ladies for a while , " Lilith told him . <p> Jane Belmore took a piece of chalk from her pocket book and put it into a little patch pocket on the front of Charlenes dress , and the two sissies held hands as Nancy led the way to the kitchen back door and out onto the flagstone patio . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , " said Corrine Beliveau . <p> " I just heard about it at Francines salon yesterday , " said Lilith . " What 's the club about ? ' Girls in Training ' ... It sounds interesting . " <p> " Its in the old Grange Hall , " explained Jane . " The members have decorated it so nice and pretty , and they had a carpenter construct a modelling runway so the sissies can show the audience their prettiest dresses in the weekly fashion contest for little girls . Only women and their darling little sissies and some slightly older real girls are allowed to be members , but the real girls do n't  take part in the fashion show . They visit the sissies at their homes and help teach them more about being girls . " <p> " Petticoating ! " said Sally . " What a lovely name for making a cute little boy a darling little sissy . Its so nice to have a precious little sissy as my granddaughter now . " <p> " Yes , " said Betsy , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid off the mortgage on the property . Now we have a healthy bank account , and a separate account we provide for research funds for area specialist doctors that do sexual reassignment surgery to our sissies when they get old enough . Theyre supposed to be eighteen to get the surgery done , but two of the members work at the town hall in the town clerks records department . They change their ages to eighteen so they can legally get the series of female hormone injections and their sex change surgery done when they 're twelve years old to make them start developing breasts like real girls do at that age . " <p> " I 'd love to have Nancy be in it , " said Lilith , " but he might need some more sissy training before we go , even though he likes wearing girls clothes and behaves like a good little girl now . Give us another month or so first . " <p> Though Lilith was n't much of a club joiner except for a seldom-used membership at the local country club , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dress at the petticoating club . But first she wanted to be sure theyd made him a complete sissy , and that he always behaved like a good little girl . Actually Lilith and Sally were right in thinking Nancy was now already a sissy and liked wearing his dresses and things and behaving like good little girl . <p> " Youll be glad when you join it Lilith , " said Irene . " On your first meeting you and Sally will each have to pay a years dues of a hundred and fifty dollars . It pays the clubs utility bills and your copies of the PETTICOATING TIMES , the clubs weekly magazine and bulletin thatll be mailed to you . And also it pays the maids that clean the building , and for the top three place prizes the sissies win . Usually the prizes are gift certificates redeemable at THE LITTLE PRINCESS DRESS SHOP and at the SUGAR N SPICE store , or for free hair styling at FRANCINES . " <p> " Lilith , would n't it be nice to see Nancy up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other ladies at the club , " said Sally . " All little girls like to show ladies how pretty they are . " <p> " Yes Mother , " agreed Lilith . " And I 'm sure Nancy will like it as well . " <p> " Lilith , " suggested Sally , " itd be nice for Nancy and Charlene to have a sleepover in Nancys canopy bed for twin little girls soon . They could tell each other their little girl secrets before they go to sleep . " <p> " Certainly Mother , " answered Lilith . " Itd be another little girl fun thing both sissies would like . But let 's wait till next week . Well be busy this week . I want to do some more shopping . They 're having a sale on petticoats at some of the stores downtown starting on Monday . " <p> While the women were sitting down with their legs crossed , the bottom edges of their petticoats were visible under the hem of their pretty dresses . Nancy liked seeing their petticoats . And now he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty dresses . It was fun being a pretty little girl now . <p> " A sale on petticoats ? " said Betsy . " Ill have to get to it . A woman can always use some new petticoats . A couple of mine have rips in their nylon netting . Somehow I must have caught one of my high heels in them without realizing it . I 'll buy some new ones and give the torn ones to a thrift shop for some unfortunate middle class lady to buy and mend . " <p> " What about bouffant slips for our sissies ? " asked Irene now that Nancy and Charlene had left and gone outside . <p> " Thats good , " replied Irene . " My little Steven is Stephany now , and he needs a new pastel blue one to go with his blue and white checked Sunday dress . " <p> " Its feels so nice to dress a little boy like a precious little girl , " said Jane . <p> " Yes , " agreed Sally . " I 'm the one that usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing his pretty dresses and things . And he always behaves like a good little girl now . I 'm sure hell grow up to be a gracious lady . " <p> " Do n't  worry Mother , " said Lilith . " Well make sure he grows up to be a proper lady . The reputation of the Meene family depends on it . There has n't  been a man permanently in our branch of the family for three generations now . " <p> " Yes , " said Sally . " My first husband did n't  have a clue how to have me get an orgasm like Frenchmen like to do , and all the second one did was quit his job and play golf . He hardly ever gave me any loving attention at all . I 'm sure they were just after my money . But I did n't  let them talk me into having a joint checking account like they both wanted to have . I gave them a small weekly allowance instead . I 'm glad I divorced both of them . " <p> " A wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meene family money on mens utterly foolish sports and things would have been a waste . You really cant expect men to do anything worthwhile with money , and they never do . " <p> The womens talk continued on for an hour . Nancy and Charlene were now outside on the patio , and Charlene drew a hop scotch pattern of squares on the flagstone surface with the chalk he took from the little pocket on his dress . Then he showed Nancy how to play the game , his little dress and bouffant slip bouncing up and down as he hopped on a different foot to another square . Then Nancy did it , a big smile on his cute face <p> After a while they sat down on a bench in the flower garden and began some girl talk . <p> " I 'm glad my mommy made me a girl , " said Charlene . <p> " I was afraid on the first day , but I 'm glad I 'm a girl now too , " said Nancy . " I do n't  wan na be a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like wearing my panties and poufy slips and dresses now . I love Gramma . When I sit on her lap , she gives me lots of hugs and kisses on my cheeks . Shes warm and soft , and she smells real pretty , too . " <p> " Most of the time I do , " answered Nancy . " But she gave me a spanking for running in the house and chewing bubble gum . " <p> " My mommy spanked me last week for being naughty , " said Charlene . " She caught me reading a SUPERMAN comic book . Afterwards we went to a store and she bought me a little book called Jack and Jill . But its really just for girls like us . " <p> " Gramma said she was going to get me a sub .. scrip .. tion to it , " said Nancy , having difficulty with the big word . " What 's a sub .. scrip .. tion ? " <p> " It means that you 'll get it in the mail that comes to your house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than having to go to a store to buy it , " replied Nancy . <p> " You better not say ' gee ' anymore , " said Charlene . " Ladies do n't  like it if we say that . Mommy said only naughty boys say that . " <p> " I saw a real big snake once in our garden that had a buzzer on its tail , " said Nancy . " It had two tongues and kept sticking them out at me too . So I ran away . It came out of the woods behind where I used to live . Then my daddy that I used to live with killed it with his hoe . I did n't  like my daddy and mommy . They drank a lot of stuff that made them say naughty things and hit each other , and all I had to wear were dirty old clothes for boys with patches on them . Dresses are lots more fun to wear . Its nice to be pretty like Aunty and Gramma are . " <p> " My mommy said girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys do n't  behave nice like we do , " said Charlene . <p> " I 'm glad I 'm a girl now , " said Nancy . <p> " Me too , " said Charlene , " but we better go back inside now . I think Mommy will take me home soon . She likes to watch a show on television in the afternoon that 's about love or something . " <p> " I love Gramma , " said Nancy . " Auntys nice to me too as long as I 'm a good girl . " <p> The two sissies went back inside to the parlor . But the ladies did n't  pay much attention to them at first . They were having tea and talking about a man and a woman in the neighborhood that had recently gottn a divorce . Naturally , they all took the womans side in the divorce , since her husband had been cheating on her with another woman . <p> Finally they all got up to leave , saying goodbye and giving each other a little hug . Then they all bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek when they said goodbye to them . <p> " I have to leave now , too , " said Jane Belmore . " I 'm going to show Charlene how to make a flower centerpiece for the dining room table . " <p> " Nancy , kiss Charlene goodbye now , " said Sally . <p> Once again the two sissies walked up close to each other in the middle of the room and kissed , and Sallys camera flashed again . Then their visitors left . <p> " Isnt it nice to have a girlfriend to play with now sweetheart ? " asked Sally . <p> " Yes Gramma , " answered Nancy . " The boys at the center used to pick on me because I was n't as big as they were . " <p> " Nobody will pick on our precious little girl now sweetheart , " said Sally as she bent down , wrapped her arms around Nancy and kissed him on the cheek . Then she stood up straight again and asked , " What do think we should do for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just relax at home Mother , " answered Lilith , " though its such a nice day perhaps we should take Nancy for a walk in the city park . She could ride one of the horses on the carousel and see the monkeys in the zoo . Theyre ugly little creatures , but they do all sorts of ridiculous funny things . " <p> " I 'll bring my camera , " said Sally , " and take some pictures of our little girl on one of the carousels horses with you standing next to her . " <p> " Alright Mother , " replied Lilith , " but let 's have some lunch before we go . " <p> After lunch was over , Sally took her expensive leather photography bag with a padded shoulder strap and Lilith drove the Cadillac and parked it near the park entrance . Lilith and Sally shook their dresses and petticoats to fluff them up , and they noticed that Nancy did it too , though the bouffant slips for little girls were so poufy that he really did n't  have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sissy to have when he became a big girl and would be wearing petticoats . Then they began to walk down a walkway in the park , the high heels of the women clicking on its blacktop surface while they held Nancy by his hands between them . Lots of other ladies were walking in the park with their little girls and boys . Eventually they came to the carousel . <p> Instead of an old fashion steam one , the carousel had an electric calliope that played Home Of The Mountain King whenever it started up for a ride . Now it was stopped , and ladies were lifting their little girls or boys onto saddles on the realistically carved pony-size wooden horses . Lilith got on the carousel with Nancy and held onto him once shed lifted him onto the saddle on one of the horses . It started up and began to circle around with the horses going up and down while the calliope played again . Sally waited for the ride to be over , then took a picture of them with Lilith still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had big smiles when Sally took their picture . Then Lilith lifted Nancy off the horse and they got down from the carousel . <p> " Lilith , " said Sally , " the picture I took will make a nice childhood memory for Nancy when she 's a big girl . " <p> " Sally , " replied Lilith , " let me take a picture of you holding Nancy up while you stand in one of the flower beds . " <p> Sally set the camera lens for the distance and on available light and showed Lilith the little button on top of the camera to press . Soon , a large picture of Sally holding Nancy up in her right arm , the edges of the layers his bouffant slip showing under the hem of his little dress would be on the living room wall . A copy of it would be hung on Nancys bedroom wall . Both of them were smiling and Nancy was holding a floating helium filled pink balloon by a string tied to his wrist , which Lilith had bought for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her new photo album shed bought just for pictures to make a photographic history of her darling sissy granddaughters little girl years . <p> After seeing the monkeys hanging by their tails and chasing each other , they took Nancy into the aviary . Lots of colorful parrots , macaws and toucans were flying around in large fenced-in cages . Outside was another larger fenced-in area where the peacocks were strutting around , their long eyed tail feathers fanned out to impress and attract the duller colored peahens . <p> After seeing the birds they decided to go back home . Once they were home , Sally took Nancy into the living room while Lilith went into the kitchen and started to make an early supper for them . <p> Sally lifted Nancy onto her lap , primped the bow on his ponytail and asked him , " Did our little girl have a nice time today precious ? " <p> " Yes Gramma , " answered Nancy . " I hope Charlene comes with her mommy to see us again . She taught me how to play hop-scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to play hop-scotch when we were little girls , " Sally told him . " And next week you and Charlene can have a sleepover together in your pretty bed . Are n't  you glad you 're our little girl now sweetheart ? " She hugged him and kissed his cheek . <p> " Yes , Gramma , " replied Nancy . " " I 'm glad I 'm a girl now . It feels nice to wear pretty dresses , and its lots more fun than being a boy . " <p> Never having seen a baby girl having her diaper changed , Nancy had no idea about the sexual difference real little girls have in their panties . The only difference between boys and girls as far as he could tell was that boys had short hair and always wore pants and shirts . Girls always wore dresses and had long hair like he did . He had always thought that he was a boy . But Aunty and Gramma always dressed him up pretty and were teaching him how to be a good little girl , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , or so he thought he was . <p> " And little girls are a lot prettier than little boys Nancy , " said Sally . " Isnt it nice to feel pretty now sweetheart ? " <p> " Yes , Gramma , " answered Nancy . " It does make me feel pretty when I think about how pretty my clothes are . " <p> Sally hugged him to her , the side are of his face against her sizeable breast that felt nice to him against his cheek . <p> " In a few more years , " said Sally , " a nice doctor lady will make you even more of a girl and you 'll grow up to be a pretty lady like Aunty . " <p> " I want to be a pretty lady like you , Gramma , " replied the sissified boy . <p> Sally smiled , hugged him closer to her and kissed him on the cheek again . <p> " Aunty and I love our little girl sweetheart , " said Sally , " so always be a good little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I will Gramma , " replied her darling little sissy grand daughter . <p> " Now let 's go have our supper Nancy , " said Sally . " Afterwards we can watch some television till its time for you to go to bed . " <p> Television was still a relatively new thing in most peoples homes since the late 1940s . Nancy had some favorite shows that he liked to watch , like Howdy-Doody and Kukla , Fran and Ollie . Another new show had just debuted , The Donna Reed Show . Lilith and Sally thought it was a good show for Nancy to watch , since fourteen year old Shelly Fabares played Donnas pretty daughter Mary , and was a good role model for Nancy to want to be when he got to be Marys age . Liliths expensive new color television was hand wired and had a little fan in it instead of having just printed circuit boards that could warp from the sets heat and break its connections . It had a twenty-one inch screen , not one of the usual smaller size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finished their supper , while Sally washed the dishes , Lilith took Nancy into the living room and turned on the television . Sally joined them a little later and sat down on Nancys other side . Dorothy And The Wizard of Oz came on , and they let Nancy stay up and watch the whole show . <p> Later on Tuesday night , The Milton Berle Show was just coming on . " The Men of Texico " sang their introductory song , and then Berle came on the stage , dressed like a little girl . But his front teeth had been blacked out and it made him look like an ugly little girl with hairy legs . The women and Nancy laughed as Lilith tugged him closer to her side . Arnold Stang told Berle he was " cheap , cheap , cheap " , and Berle replied , " What the ... hey ? " . Swearing wasnt allowed on television and Berle had almost broken the law . The rest of the show had funny skits on it . Robert Alda played the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  make a payoff to him every week , and Berle made jokes about it . <p> When the show was over , Sally took Nancy up to bed . First she took him into the upstairs bathroom and had him freshen up . Then Sally wiped his lipstick off , washed his face , neck , ears and hands , dried him off with a fluffy towel , and had him brush his teeth and rinse his mouth with some mouth wash . Then she took him into his little girls bedroom and untied the bow on his ponytail before she took off his dress and bouffant slip , hung them in his closet , and put him into one of his little pretty nighties . <p> Just like the night before , before he got in bed , Sally lifted her onto her lap while she sat on the edge of the bed and read him a story of a fairy godmother who made a poor little girl wearing a ragged dress look pretty with her magic wand , and showed him the pictures in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little sissys cheek goodnight as Nancy hugged his rag doll , Missy . <p> " Pretty dreams sweetheart , " said Sally as she turned off the light and left the room , closing the door behind her and went back downstairs to join Lilith in the living room again . <p> " Lilith , is n't it nice to have such a cute little sissy living with us ? " asked Sally . " Its plain as day he likes wearing his lacy panties , poufy slips and dresses and being our pretty little girl now . " <p> " Yes Mother , " replied Lilith . " Things have turned out better than I 'd hoped for since we began putting him in girls clothes and teaching him to be a good little girl . But being as young as he is , I was sure it would only take a little time for him to like wearing his dresses and things and being a little girl . And Charlene is just the type of little sissy for him to play with along with the other sissies and real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us some day and visit some of our other friends later on . And well go shopping again soon also . Since ladies ' petticoats and girls ' bouffant slips are on sale this week , we might as well do some more shopping for Nancy and ourselves . " <p> " I 'll love seeing him in some little girl autumn and winter clothes well be buying for him . " <p> " Some skirts and more blouses also , Mother , " said Lilith . " Dress him in one of your **25;660;TOOLONG sets tomorrow . Hell like that . By the way , they 're already advertising some girls quilted circle skirts and tights for winter thatll keep his legs warm in the cold weather . Well have to buy him some . " <p> " And some big stuffed toy animals , too , Lilith , " said Sally . " I 'll get a handyman to make a shelf on the wall near his bed to keep them on . " <p> " I understand now why women spoil their little girls so much , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new pretty dress and show him off to other women . They all make such a nice big fuss over him , giving him hugs and kissing his cheeks . " <p> " Most of the time I do n't  think of him as just a sissy , Lilith , " said Sally . " He looks and behaves like little girl so much now . Isnt it nice how he always remembers to put his hands behind him and smooth his dress and bouffant slip under him when he sits down , just like a real girl does ? " <p> " Yes Mother , " replied Lilith . " Our training has paid off very well . He s really an irreversible sissy now . Having made him a sissy makes me feel so good , and proud of myself , too . " <p> Nancy liked Gramma more than Aunty . Sally had him sit on her lap on the couch when she taught him how to crochet doilies , and she always hugged him and kissed his cheeks before they started , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Nancy had told Charlene , she smelled pretty , so he behaved like a good little girl and liked it when Gramma had him sit on her lap . He liked it now when she dressed him up pretty in the mornings . His lacy panties , poufy slips and dresses were lots more fun to wear than boys clothes . The little boy liked being a girl now . But he wondered how he could become a more of a girl like they had told he would someday . <p> One day he asked Sally , " Gramma , what 's sur ... gery ? " <p> " Oh , its just a little thing a doctor lady will do to our little girl in a few years so you can grow up to be a pretty lady , " answered Sally . " It wo n't take long and the doctor will make you sleep while its done . Youll be happy about it afterwards . " <p> " I 'm glad Gramma , " replied Nancy , " cause I want to be a pretty lady like you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sally . " Youll like being a big girl and wearing big girl dresses and petticoats , and not having to work all day like men do . " <p> One night during the next year while Nancy was upstairs hugging a rag doll ( the one he named Missy ) while he slept , Lilith told Sally they needed to talk about something important . <p> " What is it Lilith ? " Sally asked . <p> " Mother , I 'm going to see about getting Nancy his sexual reassignment surgery and hormone treatments when he s twelve years old thatll start his breasts growing , the same age as real little girls when they start developing their titties . " <p> " Well that 's a ways off , Lilith , " responded Sally . " After all , he s only eight years old . Wasnt that a nice birthday party we had for him . But I 'll miss having him be my little sissy granddaughter . He s so cute and girly now . " <p> " Yes , he s too young for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm sure he likes being a girl now . Training , discipline and patience , that 's all it takes in cases like his , along with your affectionate hugs and kisses , and encouraging him to be a good little girl , and to play nice with real little girls and other sissies . " <p> " Yes , he does Lilith , " said Sally . " You should see him smile and giggle when he plays hop-scotch now with his little girlfriends and other sissies in our neighborhood . Little Charlene is his best friend now , too . " <p> " I 'm glad to hear it , Mother , " replied Lilith . " Jane seems to have done an excellent job of making her little boy a sissy . " <p> " Lilith , you really ought to try to be more affectionate with him , " admonished Sally . " Sometimes I think he s afraid of you . " <p> " Thats probably because I gave him a little spanking , " admitted Lilith . " He was running in the house like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have made a sticky mess on the bodice of his dress . <p> " But you 're probably right . Ill be more affectionate to him from now on . Affection certainly wo n't make him any less of a sissy than he is now . He really seems to like wearing dresses and his little girl lingerie now . " <p> " Oh , I 'm sure of it , Lilith , " replied Sally . " After I finish dressing him up pretty in the mornings , a big smile comes on his face when he looks at himself in the full length mirror on the back of his bedroom door . " <p> " I can see that he likes you more than me , Sally , " said Lilith . " I guess I 've seemed threatening to him at times . But I 'll be more affectionate with more hugs and kisses from now on like you do . I can still remember you being very affectionate to me when I was a little girl . And I certainly do n't  want him to be afraid of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sissy now . That 's why we must get him his female hormone treatments and the sex change surgery . We owe it to him . " <p> " I 'm glad to hear you say that , " said Sally . " After all , we want him to still be happy after he s been made a real girl . By the way , here 's a picture I took of him cradling his doll in the crook of his arm while he was holding the bottle to its mouth . I told him to look up and smile pretty when I took the picture . Isnt he precious ! " <p> " Oh yes Mother ! " agreed Lilith . " Could you make an enlargement of it ? Itd be so good to have it on my bedroom wall as a nice reminder to me of how much we 've made him a girly little sissy . " <p> On a Monday morning in October , Sally and Lilith took Nancy shopping with them again . He liked to go shopping with Aunty and Gramma because they always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies dressing rooms before they bought them : some new panties , poufy slips and pretty dresses . And sometimes theyd buy him some little girl jewelry , like the pearl ring he had on the third finger of his right hand , and the little gold chain scarab bracelet on his left wrist , and the little pearl studs he wore in his earlobes that Francine had given Lilith . Hed seen other little girls wearing them , too . Before they went shopping , Sally had put him in one of his **27;687;TOOLONG that matched hers . As soon as he had seen himself in the full length mirror , he turned around and hugged Sallys waist . <p> " I like wearing a dress like your dress Gramma , " Nancy had said . " I love you Gramma . " Naturally Sally had bent down and wrapped arms around him in a big hug with his face between her breasts , then kissed him on the cheek . <p> While Lilith was picking out some new panties for him , Sally came over to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a little girls pink snowsuit that she held behind her back while she showed Lilith the dress . <p> " Lilith , would n't this be a nice little dress for Nancy this fall . It has lots of pretty autumn colors . And she could wear one of her pretty white bouffant slips under it to match its collar and the cuffs on the long sleeves . " <p> " Yes , it is a pretty little dress Mother , " replied Lilith . " I suppose we should begin buying her some winter clothes now . While were here I 'll buy her some quilted circle skirts , some pink tights and white ones , and some cashmere sweaters and a nice wool winter coat to keep her warm . " <p> " And shell look so cute in this little pink snow suit with the little white bunnies on the front shoulders of it , " said Sally as she took the snow suit from behind her back . " As soon as it snows this winter , I 'll go outside with her and well build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowsuit in a size larger for her . Itll be her size by winter . " <p> " Alright Mother , " answered Lilith . " But first you 'd better take her into a dressing room and try the dress on her . " <p> When Sally had Nancy in the girls size eight dress and a new white bouffant slip , she took him by the hand and they went out and stood before the tall mirror in the dress department . He twisted back and forth to make it and his bouffant slip swish around his legs with a happy smile . By now as Lilith had said , the boy had become an irreversible sissy . And he liked playing little girls games with Charlene . Charlene was his best friend now . And they always kissed without being told to when Charlene arrived . <p> About three years later ( 1957 ) <p> The bouffant style was still the fashion for women and girls , though slimmer body hugging suit dresses and blouses and skirts without petticoats under them were also being seen on a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old and looked and behaved like a girl that age . Lilith still had n't  brought him to the Petticoating Club , though she thought it was high time she did . But before doing it , there was something else both she and Sally wanted to do with him . They made an appointment for him with Dr. Dorothy Gibson , the sex change surgeon . Dr. Gibson was another extreme feminist , dedicated and determined to making sissies become real girls . <p> " His features and facial bone structure are just what I 'd hoped for , " said Dr. Dorothy Gibson . " Nancy will be a pretty young woman when he grows up . " <p> " Mrs. Meene , " said Dr. Gibson , " I 'm not so naive as to think that Nancy is the legal age of eighteen to make him eligible for sexual reassignment surgery . But do n't  worry . The law does n't  check on these things anymore . Its being done all over the country now , and they would n't be able to investigate all of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by having it done now before his puberty begins , itll be far more effective in making him a real girl . As he grows up , his skin will stay nice and soft , and he wo n't get any knotty hard muscles like teenage boys get and men have . Therell be a graceful feminine curve to his legs , a slim waist and a large pair of tits . Excuse the everyday vernacular , but I think its important to speak plain about these things . " <p> She gave Nancy his first weekly injection of female hormones and some hormone pills to take every morning with a glass of plain water as soon as he got up and a half hour before he ate or drank anything else , and said shed stop at their home early each Friday morning on her way to her office to give him his other weekly injections . But they had to wait a month for the surgery because Dr. Gibson was so busy operating on other sissies . So Lilith and Sally decided to take him to the ladies petticoating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a little scared when he heard the word " doctor . " He did n't  feel sick and he wondered why they took him to a doctor . But for a while he forgot about having the needle stuck in his arm . <p> He liked looking in his big closet and seeing all his pretty dresses and poufy slips hanging in it . Every morning hed wonder which pretty dress Sally would dress him in for the day . His favorite dresses were ones that looked like Grammas dresses . Once he was all dressed up pretty in a dress like her own , Sally would give him a hug , kiss his cheek and tell him what a big girl he was getting to be . It made him smile and hed hug Sally . <p> Like mother-like daughter , Sally and Lilith were both 5 9 " tall . When they wore their four inch high heels , they stood 6 1 " . A bit self conscious of their height , they often wore just three inch high heels . But that still raised their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their height , and it often resulted in a restaurants maitre d giving them a better table , and getting faster and better service from a waiter or a stores salesgirls . <p> But one day a boy that had n't  been turned into a sissy yet , heard his mother tell another lady what an adorable prissy little sissy Nancy was . He told a couple of his pals about it , and they took a walk up to Liliths home . They caught Nancy picking wild daisies by himself near the driveway to make a bouquet he wanted to give to Gramma . <p> " Hey sissy boy , " said one of boys , " show us your panties . " <p> Nancy turned to run back inside , but one of the boys pushed him down on the driveway and he began to cry while the boys laughed at him . <p> Lilith and Sally happened to be in the drawing room and they went outside to see what the noise was about , Lilith taking a yardstick with her . She waved it over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran away , yelling out " Sissy boy . Sissy boy , " sniggering and chortling like little ogres . <p> " They .. they made me hur .. hurt my kn .. knee , " said Nancy as he sobbed and buried his face in the skirts of Sallys dress . <p> " Do n't  cry sweetheart , " said Sally as she hugged him and patted his back . " Ill wash it off and put some nice medicine and a band-aid on it . Lilith , I do n't  want to put a lot of red iodine on Nancys knee . Ill put some antiseptic ointment on it and a band-aid after I wash it . It wont sting like iodine does either . " <p> " See Nancy ? " said Lilith . " This is why girls only play with other girls . Boys are jealous because girls are pretty . Gramma and I know what 's best for our pretty girl sweetheart . " <p> They went back inside the house and Sally tenderly washed the little booboo on his knee , next put some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band-aid . <p> " Well , our little girl has her first scrape on her knee , " said Sally as she gave Nancy a hug and kissed his cheek . Then Nancy went inside to watch The Donna Reed Show . <p> " Yes Mother , " said Lilith . " His little girl Purple Heart . Sooner or later all little girls and sissies fall down and bang their knee . Im surprised it did n't  happen before now , considering how much Nancy and Charlene still love to jump rope together . <p> Well take Nancy to the little girls fashion show for sissies tomorrow night . " <p> " Wont it be wonderful Lilith when he s been made our real girl soon ? " said Sally with a dreamy-eyed look in her eyes as she thought about it . <p> " Yes Mother , " replied Lilith . " The female side of the Meene family line will continue then . I 've already put a considerable amount of money in a bank account in Nancy s name so hell be able to live the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . No woman in our branch of the family have ever had to stoop to working for a living . And hell get the bulk of the family money when you and I are gone . By the way , the dividends from our IBM stock have been enormous . I think personal computers are going to be the wave of the future . " <p> " I just hope that well both still be living and healthy when he s a pretty young woman , " said Sally . <p> " I 'm sure we both will Mother , " Lilith assured Sally . " After all , neither one of us is old yet , and were in excellent health . Men simply are n't  as healthy as women are . They let themselves get fat and have all that testosterone hormone running through their bodies that causes so many heart attacks and cancer to men when they 're only in their fifties or sixties . But once Nancy s had his surgery with his testicles and penis removed and has a vagina and uterus , his body wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibson explained it all to me . " <p> " Isnt medical science wonderful Lilith ! " said Sally . <p> " Yes Mother , " replied Lilith . " They should have started this and the cloning technique that 's being developed a long time ago . Only baby girls that are genetic copies of their pretty mothers would have been born . By now itd be strictly a womens and girls world . But someday during this decade it will be . We just have to wait till the men have died off . Any men that are still alive after ten years can be painlessly euthanized for their own good ( What ? ! editor ) ( That 'll surprise the islamo-fascists ! other editor ) . Think how nice and pretty the world will be with only women and girls in it . Well probably start it all in our own country and western Europe first . But imagine China with its population of half a billion women in it . Theyll do away with communism . Some men are such morons when it comes to picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain has a queen . Mark my words . Someday theyll do away with their quarrelsome clumsy parliament and leave things for Her Majesty to decide . We women always know what 's best for everyone , including Nancy . " <p> " I agree with you Lilith , " said Sally , " but I 'll miss having our precious sissy living with us after he s grown into a young lady . " <p> " So will I Mother , " said Lilith . " Its been so nice making him a sissy . Petticoating a cute boy like him and having him wearing panties , a bouffant slip and a dress makes me feel so good , and accomplished , too . " <p> " And teaching him how to be a good little girl too , " said Sally . " We really should have had him get ballet lessons . Imagine how darling he would have looked making a pirouette on stage , wearing his little tutu and ballet slippers . " <p> " Time , Mother , " said Lilith . " That was a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was only five or six years old , then we would have had the time to see that he got ballet lessons . But we had our hands full enough teaching him to be a seven year old little girl then . " <p> " When are we going to take him to that nice club for sissies ? " asked Sally . <p> " At tomorrow night 's meeting , " answered Lilith . " Ill call Jane Belmore and have her meet us there in the parking lot . Today , why do n't  you have him practice making a curtsey ? He has n't  had to do it for a while . Itd be nice to see him to do it on the runway to the women in the audience . " <p> " What dress do you think we should have him wear for the meeting ? " asked Sally . <p> " One of the mother and daughter dresses , " answered Lilith . " I 'll pick out one of the sets that I have and wear it with him instead of yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not , Lilith , " replied Sally . " Wear the new pink gingham set in the larger size he takes now we bought recently . I think that 's the prettiest one . " <p> " A pretty choice Mother , " said Lilith . " I hope so much hell win one of the prizes after all our work in getting him to look and behave like a good little girl . " <p> " Maybe we should have had Francine dye his hair , " said Sally . " Girls and sissies with black hair and a pink bow on their ponytails look so pretty . " <p> " True enough Mother , " said Lilith . " But there 's never been a black haired woman our branch of the Meene family . Well stick to our and his genetic natural blond hair like our own for him . It makes him appear to be a little girl in our own family , and it contrasts nicely with the pink plastic hair band he wears sometimes or the pink bow on his ponytail . <p> " Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspaper not long ago , that my cousin and his wife or whatever she is , were denied an earlier release from prison . It seems more evidence has come to light that shows they were selling drugs to high school children in the schools parking lot . As a result , theyll have to serve their full sentences of twenty years in prison . Theyll be no parole for either of them . " <p> " Besides that , Lilith , " said Sally , " having been declared unfit parents , the court would never give Nancy back to them to raise . " <p> " Nancy behaves like he s all girl now Mother , " said Lilith with a satisfied smile . " I 'm sure hell do well in the little girl fashion contest for sissies tomorrow night . " <p> The next day , Lilith and Sally explained to Nancy in the kitchen what hed be doing at the petticoating club that night . <p> " You just have to walk down and back on the modelling runway to show lots of nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What 's a runway ? " asked Nancy . <p> " Its like wooden sidewalk up above the floor a little so all the ladies in the audience can look up at to see how pretty our girls bouffant slip and dress is , " explained Sally . " It has a special carpet on it so you wont slip and fall down . Wont that be fun , sweetheart ? " <p> Now thoroughly a sissy , Nancy liked wearing a pretty dress that looked like his auntys dress or his grammas dress . He left the two women and went into the living room to watch The Donna Reed Show that was about to start . <p> " Nancy looks like such a pretty girl now , Lilith , " said Sally . " I love helping him put on his poufy slip and a pretty dress in the morning . He puts his own panties on himself now . " <p> " All in all , " said Lilith , " I think we 've done an excellent job of making him a sissy . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real girl once Dorothy Gibson has actually changed his sex and gender for good . By the way Mother , she has a reputation for being the best doctor in the country for the female hormone treatments and sexual reassignment surgery . I wonder what Nancy would have thought when he first came to live with us if he knew hed be turned into a real girl after a few years . " <p> " Well never know , Lilith , " replied Sally . " But it seems to me that sissies like Nancy should be made real girls , and I 'm sure hell like it when he s a real girl . " <p> " I agree Mother , " said Lilith . " And itll be so nice seeing him going to his first prom wearing a pretty gown . By the way , they have dances at the petticoating club on some of the evenings they do n't  have their regular meetings , just for sissies of course . " <p> " You mean sissies dance just with other sissies ? " asked Sally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We certainly would n't want any early teenage pregnancies taking place later on . If they develop lesbian tendencies after their sex change surgery , that 's a risk well have to take , and its still better than being a man . " <p> " Well , its close to the time well be going to tonights meeting , " said Sally . " Wed better get ready to go . His new larger size pink gingham dress and white bouffant slip fit him just right . I 'm sure hell look adorable on the runway . " <p> " Mother , be sure he takes his accessories with him , his pretty white cloth gloves and his shiny white pocketbook . " <p> " He always remembers to take them when we go anywhere , Lilith , thanks to our reminding him . He really has a girls habits now . I put his lipstick , a compact and a lilac colored floral hanky trimmed with white lace in his pocketbook . And I had him practice making a curtsey for a while yesterday . " <p> " Then let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come with them . <p> As soon as they were in the Cadillac , Lilith , Sally and Nancy leaned back against the seats backrest , lifted their bums up a little and smoothed their dresses and petticoats under them . <p> " Do n't  forget to curtsey nice to the ladies when you reach the front end of the runway Nancy , " Lilith told him , " and keep your left hand on top of your pocketbook when you 're walking . " <p> " I wont forget , Aunty , " replied Nancy , feeling excited and eager to go to the nice club theyd told him about . Nancy was anxious to show the all the ladies they told him would be in the audience how pretty he was in his new pink gingham dress with a new lacy white poufy slip under it . <p> A large number of cars were in the parking lot , and Jane Belmore was there with her sissy Charlene , holding him by the hand at her side . <p> " Mommy bought me a new dress to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty Charlene , " said Nancy . " It must make you feel pretty , too . " <p> " Yes Nancy , " said Charlene , " and your dress is very pretty , too . " Then the two sissies kissed without being told to , much to the smiling delight of the women . <p> " Lilith , I 'll take the girls to a room backstage to get their makeup touched up and get their instructions for the show , " said Jane . <p> " Thanks Jane , " replied Lilith . " Nancy , go with Charlene and her mommy now sweetheart . And do n't  forget the things we told you to do . " <p> " Yes Aunty , " said Nancy . " I wont forget . " <p> Lilith and Sally stopped at a desk near the entrance and they both paid their dues for a year , and then were each given the latest copy of THE PETTICOATING TIMES , the clubs magazine and bulletin , printed just that morning and rush-delivered to the club . <p> Soon an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short white petticoats under it and white four inch high heels with black stockings took them to a table near the end of the runway . He quickly returned with a tray and placed a cut glass decanter of Chablis and wine glasses for them on the table along with a plate of hors doeuvres . <p> Meanwhile , the prizes for the winning toddler-age sissies were being given out by Brunhilde ( pronounced Brun-hill-deh ) , the clubs Chapter Matron , wearing a bright red dress with three black petticoats and a black full slip , trimmed with a red ribbon running through its black lace bottom edge under her petticoats . <p> The first prize winners mother held him in up her arm as she kissed his cheek and took the first prize for the toddler age sissy winner , a ten dollar gift certificate redeemable at the Sugar N Spice store for little girls . <p> The women in the audience cheered and clapped their approval . <p> Two other women came along and asked Lilith if they could share their table . <p> " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to find out more about the club . <p> The two woman sat down , smoothing their dresses , petticoats and slips under them and introduced themselves to Lilith and Sally . <p> " By the way , " asked Lilith , " how long has the club been in existence ? " <p> " It started up after the Korean War was over , " explained Carol Morse , " and had a very small membership . But as soon as the bouffant style came along , its membership grew much larger , and now its hard to find room in the parking lot . " <p> " I can understand why , " said Sally . " The sissies look so darling in their little dresses with a bouffant slip poufing them out nice and pretty . " <p> " Tell me something , " said Lilith . " Has there ever been any indication of masturbation by the sissies ? " <p> " Its definitely forbidden , " answered Barbara Edwards . " The club rules that you signed require you to give a spanking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , real little girls hardly ever do it . My sister June Cleaver is divorced now and has a sissy they used to call Beaver , but his name is Judy now that he s been petticoated . And she had to spank him three times before he stopped doing it . His older brother lives with his father . " <p> " I 'll check Nancys panties and bed sheets from now on , " said Lilith , " but so far he seems to behave like a good girl . In another month I wo n't have to bother . Dr. Dorothy Gibson will have given him his sexual reassignment surgery by then , making him a real girl . Sally and I can hardly wait till its been done . " <p> " Youre right in step with the other matrons in the club , " said Carol . " Its really the best thing for them . Once a boy has been made a sissy , hed never fit in as a regular teenage boy . Theyd all have their happy memories of their sissy little girl years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're older . " <p> " Matrons ? " asked Lilith . <p> " Its just a title we call ourselves since we have to check and make sure our sissies are n't  doing any boy things , such as reading boys naughty comic books like BATMAN , or watching violent westerns or war movies on television . " <p> " Yes , " said Lilith . " Sally and I only let Nancy read Jack &amp; Jill Magazine and a couple of other little books for girls . I suppose ' matron ' is a good title for us . I 'm always checking to see Nancy is n't backsliding into any boyish behavior . <p> " Yesterday I began reading LITTLE WOMEN to Nancy . There are some nice pictures in the book , and Nancy could hardly take his eyes off the long pretty dresses and petticoats girls wore when it was written a hundred years or more ago . " <p> " Just think Lilith , " continued Sally . " In another month or less , Nancy will be turned into a real girl . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty will be accomplished and our dreams a reality . Well have to have a special party for her as soon as she 's recovered from the surgery . Ill hire an RN to stay with her while she 's recovering , and well have a handyman set up a cot in Nancys room for the nurse . Dr. Gibson said a nurse should take her temperature frequently to make sure there is n't any infection from the surgery . But imagine Mother , the cute little boy that came to live with us will soon be a real girl and have growing breasts and a cunt and vagina like other twelve year old girls . I 'm glad I already had one of the other matrons of the Petticoating Club that works in the town hall records change his age to eighteen to make him legally eligible for his surgery . " <p> " Imagine Nancy going to her first prom wearing a lovely gown , " said Sally . " But I 'll really miss not having a precious little sissy living with us anymore . " <p> " I will too Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and itll be nice having a pretty young woman of our own family living with us in a few years . " <p> " We all have the same plans for our sissies , " said Carol . " Its a requirement for all matrons in the club to get their sissies turned into real girls when they get to be twelve years old . Otherwise youd have your membership in the club revoked . " <p> " What a wonderful club this is ! " said Sally . <p> At this point , Brunhilde announced the beginning of the little girl fashion show for the matrons sissies . <p> " Matrons , remember that the three winners are decided by the amount of applause you give to each sissy when he finishes his walk on the runway . And do n't  forget the chartered bus shopping trip to New York City well make next month . Your cars can be left in our parking lot , and security guards will keep an eye on them day and night to prevent any vandalism . We plan to shop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to buy the latest fashions for your sissies and yourself , as well . Be sure you sign up for the trip by the end of this meeting or next weeks meeting at the latest . And now let 's begin the program for little and pre-teen sissies . By the way , we have two new co-matrons in our club now , the sissys aunt and foster mother and his substitute grandmother , Lilith Meene and Sally St. James . Ladies , would you stand up please ? " <p> Lilith and Sally stood up and smiled . <p> Applause went up from the other smiling matrons . <p> As Lilith and Sally looked around , they spotted other women in the audience that they knew or had seen in some of the stores they shopped in for Nancy . <p> " The first sissy to be on the runway is Annabelle , and his matron is his mother Rachel Lee , " announced Brunhilde . <p> " Annabelle Lee , " said Lilith . " Isnt that a lovely name . It comes from one of Edgar Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pastel blue dress over his white bouffant slip and panties was assisted up the rear stairs of the runway by a club matron and began to walk down the runway . When he came to the end of it , he turned around and walked back and sat down on a chair in four long rows of them at the back of the stage . Sitting below the level of the runway , his lace trimmed pink panties were visible to the audience of women as his bouffant slip and dress flared out when he had quickly turned to walk back down the runway . Applause and cheers came up from the big audience of matrons and their lady guests staying with them . <p> The next sissy was wearing a little pink dress with short puffed sleeves , a little secretary collar and a lacy bodice . <p> He also received cheers and clapped applause from the audience of matrons . <p> " Mother , have n't they decorated the club so nice ! " said Lilith . " Did you notice the pictures of the winning sissies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all look so precious . I really wish Nancy had come to live with us when he was just a toddler . Sissies that age are so darling . Their little dresses and poufy slips are so short their pretty panties with rows of pretty lace on the back of them are always coming into view when they play on a living room rug . " <p> While the sissies were on the runway , the clubs photographer matron would take a picture of each sissy in case he turned out to be a winner in the little girl fashion show . She was also allowed to sell the negatives to several nation wide monthly magazines for women that wanted to copy the pictures for their fashion pages for their readers little girls and sissies . <p> Sally had brought her own camera and extra film and flash bulbs to take Nancys picture when he had his walk on the runway , and both she and Lilith noticed that most of the other matrons also had a camera ready to take a picture of their own sissies . Flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sissies walked down and back on the runway . Most of the sissies in the little and preteen part of the show were between seven and eleven years old . <p> " Mother , is n't this such a nice display of sissies , " said Lilith with a smile . " They all look like such pretty little girls . I 'm so glad we joined the club . And its good to know there are so many other right-thinking women in our area . " <p> " Oh , I 'm very glad we joined it too Lilith , " replied Sally . " Maybe Nancy will meet some other sissies thatll become new girlfriends with him . Thatll help increase his girly femininity and be happy when he s a real girl soon . " <p> " Youre right Mother , " agreed Lilith . " And I have to admit that making a boy a sissy and naming him Nancy has been the most rewarding , fun-filled and satisfying experience in my life so far . And the wonderful culmination of it all will be when Nancys had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " <p> " I feel the same way Lilith , " agreed Sally . " And its really been the best thing for him to have been made a sissy by us . After all , being raised as a little girl is such a pretty and happy experience for all sissies . And I 'm sure he must had sissy tendencies even before he came to live with us . Why else would he have liked being dressed pretty and being taught to behave like a good little girl so soon as he did ? " <p> " In that case Mother , " said Lilith , " dressing him in girls clothes and teaching him to behave like one must have made him happy that we raised him like a little girl , though it may have taken a little time and coaxing before he admitted it to himself and us . " <p> " Not as long as you think Lilith , " said Sally . " On just his second day with us , after I dressed him up nice and pretty for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his reflection in the full-length mirror on the back of his bedroom door , and he told me it he liked wearing his pretty dress and things and that it was lots more fun being a girl . " <p> " Really Mother ? " asked Lilith . " That make me not feel any guilt about making a him a sissy . And also not guilty for getting him his sexual reassignment surgery and the rest of his female hormone injections , not that I should feel guilty about any of it at all . After all , girls and women are the superior sex , not boys and men . " <p> " Of course we are Lilith , " said Sally . " You ca n't blame women for starting wars and for most of the crime committed in the world . Even when a woman kills her husband , its usually for a justifiable reason . Some men are such brutes in the way they mistreat their wives , acting like beastly drunken cavemen . " <p> This time an eleven year old sissy introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink poodle skirt with white three white nylon horsehair petticoats with scalloped lace trim , and a white short sleeve cashmere sweater with a pink scarf tied around his blond ponytail , and pink socks and saddle shoes began his walk down the runway . Naturally , his matron had also put a bright pink lipstick and nail polish on him . A happy cute smile was on his face as he walked down the runway . <p> Brunhilde , the Chapter Matron , had introduced him as Mary-Beth . <p> " By the way , " Lilith asked Carol , " why is Brunhilde referred to as the Chapter Matron ? " <p> " Because there other chapters of the club in lots of other cities in our country . The Ladies Petticoating and Girls-in-Training Club is a nation wide organization now , from coast to coast . The San Francisco Chapter was the largest one with more than five hundred sissies in it , so now theyve split it up into chapters for different parts of the city . Having too many sissies in one chapter does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their turn on the runway . " <p> " Fabulous ! " said Lilith . " That means that if we had gone on a vacation , perhaps we would have been able to have Nancy have his turn on the runway in another citys chapter as a visiting sissy . " <p> " Oh yes , " said Carol . " The matrons of visiting sissies are actually encouraged by the national headquarters located in New York City , where the club started , to have their sissies take part in the other chapter meetings in other cities . It helps to spread around any new sissy making techniques to the clubs Matrons in other chapters . " <p> " I always loved New York City , " said Sally , " and now I have another reason for loving it . And Best and Companys store in Boston carries such a pretty line of clothes for women and girls . They have another branch of their store in New York City , but its always so crowded that I usually do n't  bother to shop there . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down there . " <p> " Thats why the club has a chartered bus trip to New York City once every year , " replied Carol . <p> " Hmm , I 'll have to keep that in mind , " said Lilith . " Some of the special low-priced sales on dresses and lingerie Ive seen advertised in the Sunday edition of the New York Times ' fashion section are bargains , not that money would be a problem for Sally or me . And its always nice to visit another city for a few days . I love to have dinner at Lutrecs , New York Citys best French restaurant . The food and service are the best in the city . Sally and I can both speak French , and it always impresses the waiters when we order in French . Some day I 'd love to make a trip to Paris , where the bouffant style began .

" <p> " Lilith , " said Barbara Cleaver , " we are all aware of your familys tremendous wealth and the ability to be able to take lots of such great vacations . But always remember one of your principal duties as club members here in your own chapter ; to encourage other mothers or stepmothers , aunts and teenage sisters desire to petticoat their their little boys or little brothers and make them sissies by raising them like little girls , and to provide help and advice to them in achieving it .

Meanwhile , Nancy was backstage and talking with another sissy . <p> " Aunty and Gramma took me to a doctor lady the other day , " said Nancy . " She used a big needle to put some stuff in my arm to make my titties grow . My chest sort of hurts now if I push anything against it . I do n't  think I 'll ever be able to be a boy again now . " <p> " Do n't  you like being a girl ? " asked the other sissy . <p> " Oh , sure I do , " replied Nancy . " But sometimes I remember when I was a boy . It seems like a long time ago .

The club matron took his hand and led him up the stairs at the back end of the modelling runway . <p> She told him , " Its time to show all the ladies how pretty you are Nancy . Just walk steady down and back on the runway sweetheart , but not too fast or too slow . Good luck Nancy . " She gave him a little hug and then he started walking down the runway . <p> " Look Mother ! " said Lilith . " Here comes Nancy .

Sitting below the runway , the matrons in the audience could see his lacy panties and the bottom edge nylon ruffles of his bouffant slip when he had turned quickly . Nancy was the only sissy that curtsied at the front end of the runway . Clapped applause and a loud cheer had come up from the the audience of women when he had curtsied , and Sally had taken his picture . When he had reached the back end of the runway again , he sat down in one of the folding chairs in three long rows at the back of the stage , keeping his feet and knees together with his hands in his lap like a good little girl . <p> More sissies had their turn on the runway until all of them had done it . <p> At the back of the stage at a podium a little to one side of the runway , Brunhilde could be seen quietly conferring with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

By then Nancy was back on the runway also . <p> When the audience of women noticed Nancy and Lilith were wearing mother and daughter dresses , the cheered and clapped even louder , as well as loudly stamping and clicking their high heels on the floor in approval . <p> " We praise Nancys girly demeanor , " said Brunhilde , " and by the way Ms. Meene , I think the **27;716;TOOLONG are such a lovely way of encouraging Nancy to be a pretty little girl .

Though now a real girl , he still would n't be able to get pregnant . <p> Lilith and Sally sent him to a private school for girls near the eastern side of Massachusetts . She graduated and went on to college , majoring in fashion design and art . <p> But now Nancy had developed the same determination Lilith and Sally had had in making him a sissy when he was still just a little boy .

Soon Lilith and Sally entered the room . <p> " Aunt Lilith , " said Nancy , " I 'm so glad you saved the clothes I wore when I was a little sissy . I 'm sure theyll fit Timmy , I mean Tammy .

She lived with her mother and aunt ; I do n't  know where the father was . She was a model and also appeared on some television programs , very nice and never acted stuck up . One day , my mother said that Patsys mother asked her if I would be willing to model . " They pay very well , " she told my mother . My mother told her I would do it because we needed every nickel we could get . The next Saturday , I took a shower and got all cleaned up and went to Patsys apartment . Patsy said that she was glad I was doing it , because most of the boy models she had ever met were brats . Patsy and her mother and I then left and went downtown on the subway .

I shook it and she told me that her name was Mrs. Davis . She told me to come with her to the dressing room . I could see a bunch of girls sitting around . Anyway , in the dressing room she told me to take off all my clothes and put on the white tee shirt and underpants . She must have seen me blush because she said , " Do n't  be silly or shy , everyone here has seen boys in their underwear . Youll be modeling that underwear and some other stuff .

I sat down where Mrs. Davis pointed and was able to conceal the rather large erection I had developed . The director told them to move and the picture taking began . I could not hear the directions , but they alternately struck poses beside each other and then swirled around , causing their petticoats to billow out . Meanwhile , the cameras were clicking like crazy . They seemed to enjoy it and they all had warm , dreamy smiles on their faces .

The girls were moving , changing positions with me standing like a stone with my hands at my sides and my face beet red . The silky petticoats were swishing and swirling around my legs and I thought that I would explode . They must have taken 50 shots . <p> Just as the director said , " Thats great and that 's all , " one of the girls put her hand on my erection through the underpants , squeezing it ever so softly and whispered , " Do n't  be shy .

" One of the other women said , " The poor kid is going to faint , if he ca n't cover his underpants soon . " The director said , " I think you 're right , " and with that walked away for a minute and came back with a powder blue frothy petticoat and handed it to me . " Step into this .

In a few of the pictures , two of the girls were pulling up my petticoat to reveal my briefs while the other girls alternately acted shocked and then amused .

The girls all came over and were chatting with me and told me that they all liked me and that I shouldnt be so shy , although they also said that they liked that I was shy so that they could control things . Karen said , " Girls underwear is much prettier than boys and feels a lot nicer . We hope that you can enjoy wearing the panties and petticoat .

She told me to go in the kitchen and get her a coke . I had been listening to her talk on the phone to one of her girlfriends . She was being so butch and cussing .

" I started begging ( I think for my life ) - she was real mad . <p> After about five minutes of begging , she did something that I would never have guessed she would do .

I was then dressed in panties and bra and a silk slip and petticoats and her old party dress from when she was about my age .

@@37517919 @6517919/ <p> In the 1950 , ' s when I was 12 years old , I grew up in a family of all women , so it was n't unusual to wander by an open bedroom door and catch one of them dressing up for a date . I always admired the clothes girls and women got to wear . Such a variety of pretty things , from delicate undergarments to soft , sensuous outerwear . For a guy it was pull on a pair of Jockey shorts and a pair of pants or jeans , top it off with a white shirt and bowtie and you were dressed . A young girl dressing up took much more time , as though it was a ritual that every layer of her attire be perfectly applied . I actually think they enjoy the stages of half nudity while at the same time watching themselves in the mirror become fully dressed . <p> The feel and texture of a female 's material that they wore also fascinated me , such soft and gentle fabrics . Girls clothes were very pretty to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky elegance caressing various parts of the body . Occasionally when everyone was out of the house on a Saturday night date , I would be left home alone for a few precious hours to investigate the sensuous feel and smell of female clothing for my self . <p> My first experiment was the look and feel of hosiery . First I shaved off the tiny hairs that cropped up on my legs , including the fine peach fuzz at grew on my derriere . The feel of my new skin was very pleasant . One at a time I carefully rolled up the Nylon stocking in my hands as I had watched my sister do many times . Gingerly I placed the stocking over the tip of my pointed toes and slowly wiggled the garment up the length of my newly silkened leg , until it reached the top of my thigh , where before fastening it in place I fanned out the lacy decorative top . Later on in my experiments I mastered the delicious garter belt , snapping the decorative top of my stocking in tight submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carefully checked my seams , for straightness by viewing the back of my silky legs in the full-length mirror . I would stand in front of this mirror for hours delicately lifting my skirts to different heights , unveiling my nyloned legs and showing my lacy under panties . The exotic glimpse of my black satin garter belt with long tendrils gently holding up my stockings gave me quite a sexual thrill . Each time I did this I felt a new awareness of my own sexuality . <p> The next layer of utter pleasure were the silky panties that fit loosely like boxer shorts . As I slid them over my ankles and up my thighs I felt a swelling occur between my legs as my penis began to enlarge to a full erection . I wondered did girls have this much trouble ? Yes , I was still a bit confused about the differences between men and women . <p> My dad died when I was very young and there was no male figure in my family to explain the facts of life to me . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the whole concept of sex to me . That 's when I realized women got the better part of the sexual deal . Ladies got to wear all the pretty clothes and have an exorbitant capacity for sexual activity . A woman could have sexual encounter after encounter with different male partners , tiring them all out . She was worshipped from head to toe . Her beautiful breasts were cloaked in satin Bras . Tight pussy 's draped in satin panties with lace trim . Sleek legs hugged tightly by Silk or Nylon stockings , being crowned at the tip of a dainty foot with delicate high heel shoes . Long tresses and full heads of hair scented with the aroma of exotic perfumes , gently filling the space around her sensuous body . I truly envied not being a girl or a woman . The presence of a sexy feminine gal is enough to unnerve and render any red blooded male into a babbling idiot . If he was lucky , she would choose him for a sexual partner on any particular evening and seduce him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to believe that women have tossed all those great attributes out the window , just so they can compete with men on the same level . When all along they had such an advantage over the power of men . <p> Next I would slip into one of the crinolines that I picked earlier and laid out on the bed with all the other goodies . At first the petticoat was a bit scratchy and uncomfortable , but once I slipped on a taffeta crepe under slip , beneath the crinoline , it all felt much better . Once again I felt a moist secretion in my panties . It felt gently cool and mysteriously sticky . I lifted my crinoline to see what it was , but could not find any measurable substance . My whole body felt aglow and titillating . I grew weak in the knees as I sat on the edge of the bed with my petticoats in the air . When my penis was at rest once again I resumed dressing as a girl . My total fascination at this point was with petticoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what an angel must feel like and going to heaven would be worth all the effort it would take . Over my head I pulled another full petticoat of a different color . The hem of this one had a fluffy lace and chiffon decorative trim . Again I put on another crinoline of yet a different color . This one had a shimmery satin finish to it and sown at various points along the edge were red ribbons . The rustling sound of all this femininity caused great excitement to me and I was anxious to put on the skirt . <p> The skirt I chose was made of a light chiffon material , beige in color . It was a full swirl skirt and it came to just below the knee . The design was flowery , small buttercups printed over the beige background . It was layered in three tiers with overlapping flounces at each level . Over this creation I dressed in a soft cashmere pink sweater . The flat chested look in the mirror was a real turn off , so I tried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Kleenex too . Later I found a falsie or two in one of the bottom drawers . They made a much better appearance , but something was still missing . It was then my mind recalled how breasts looked under clothes having a bouncing movement . Carefully filling two rubber balloons with water I created voluptuous tities for myself . Placing the balloons was tricky as I thought they might break and leak . I was n't quite sure how high on my chest they should sit either . Gingerly I placed them in the satiny halter and put the sweater back on . WOW ! I Looked great for a guy . My cock immediately swelled to twice it 's placid state at the sight of my feminie sexiness there in the mirror looking back at me . <p> As I continued to check myself out in the mirror , the swelling of my cock continued to increase causing me to feel a dull ache . I thought it would explode under all that silk and chiffon caressing my young body . I Gently reached down to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing . Then I squeezed my penis very hard . It grew even larger . So large you could now see it sticking up through all the finery covering my body . <p> I laid face down on the bed , and writhed my pelvis up and down back and forth . The rubbing of my penis felt good against the surface of the bed , especially under all those crinolines and silk garments . I could sense the hem of my skirt and the ends of all those petticoats touching the sensitive parts of my body . Especially the erotic zones on the back of my legs and thighs . <p> The writhing motion of my body became incredibly faster and faster , as if I were not in control . All of a sudden I had a sensation like I was going to urinate . The tip of my cock exploded with a hot sticky liquid and spread itself all over the silky under panties , slip and petticoats . I collapsed in sheer exhaustion , not knowing what had happened to me , but I loved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could . I stayed dressed in all the sissy clothes the rest of the night until once again about an hour later my cock swelled beneath my dresses and once again I masturbated some more . <p> This time I placed several pillows under me for added sensitivity . It seemed that for almost 20 minutes I was bumping and grinding on the pillows , but nothing would happen other than the intense building of erotic and sensuous feelings . Upon my weakened knees I stood as I pulled up all the silk , satin and lace under pinnnings up to my face throwing my flying skirts over top of the pillow and laid back down on the pillows . The cool soft pillows felt exotic against my flat hot pelvis and enlarged penis . Rigorously I pumped against the pillows beneath my loins as I watched my skirts billow out all around me in light gentle fluffy motion . <p> All of a sudden an extremely hot charge of my semen ejaculated from the opening of my dick . It seemed like I climaxed for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pillows under my command . Again and again ecstatic explosions burst from my genitals . I never wanted to stop ! Eventually I grew very weak and fell into a sweet deep sleep . My cock remained hard the whole time . <p> As I slept , I relived the whole experience again in my dreams . Finally I woke up with a euphoric feeling of self satisfaction and contentment . For years this activity would occupy my free stolen moments of self induced pleasure . I never grew out of this activity , but have now taken to writing about it so that others might realize we sissy boys are not so abnormal , but we just have an increased sensitivity that most people on earth do n't have any clue about . It is the prime reason many of us stay in the closet about our sexual pleasure derived from cross dressing .

This day I decided to go for it and not only put on a full white petticoat but also one of my mother 's bras , knickers and tights . <p> The thrill of walking from class to class with the silkiness of my petticoat caressing my legs was incredible . I could feel the bra straps across my back and shoulders all day .

I would pretend I had a regulation navy pleated skirt and silky white blouse on as well . <p> One thing I had forgotten - today was our annual school medical .

I now felt severe panic , sweat pouring from me . The sister noticed and tried to reassure me all the time urging me to remove my trousers , jumper and shirt . <p> I knew I was caught and would be found out so I gave in and removed my jumper whereupon the outline of my bra could be plainly seen . The nurse seemed perplexed and told me to remove my trousers and shirt . I pulled down my trousers to reveal my silky full slip . I remember trying to explain and started to cry . The nurse to my surprise was very kind ( she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to me about my underwear and explained that she would need to come with me to my home and talk to my mother and father .

Three young girls who were around my age lived down the street from me . I used to play with them in the yard - but when they got bored with that , they 'd send me home and go inside and play . One day , I pleaded with them to let me play inside with them , to which they replied that I could , but it was all girl 's games only . I agreed , and thus began my life as a Poufbunny ! <p> What started out as simple games of playing with Barbies and tea sets , soon turned to dress-up time . I had to ' dress the part ' so to speak .

The tutu had a top layer skirt of yellow satin identical to the bodice with sequin trim around the hem . The white tutu underneath was very puffy and short - like 5 or 6 layers of stiff netting , with a thin yellow satin ribbon trim along each layer 's edge . <p> I remember as I got undressed behind a curtain seeing that beautiful costume laying there in front of me , and somehow knowing this was gon na be something BIG in my life !

So just why my mother should want to fool her elder sister Joan that I was actually my twin sister Tina , was yet another of those mysteries . However , I did n't have very long to consider the problem because the front door soon opened and there was Auntie Joan , complete with her coke-bottle spectacles and hearing aid , as usual .

It seems like only yesterday that you were running around with that twin brother of yours , Timmy , in shorts . Yet here you are now , looking so beautiful in that pretty dress !

I followed my mother into the lounge and managed to sit down in my best feminine manner , i.e. , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a great relief to finally get to sit down and rest my feet , because the shoes I had been walking in for some twenty minutes were really starting to pinch my toes . Even worse were the restrictive confines of the girdle ! <p> However , at least I had now gotten used to having the unusual effect of wearing a padded bra , not to mention the continual rustle of the lacy petticoats under Tina 's party frock . The nylons I was wearing did n't seem to be a problem , either . How long could I keep l this charade going , though ? All I had to do was sit there looking pretty with my knees crossed , and let my mother do all the talking or so I thought ! <p> 8 . AN EARLY BIRTHDAY PRESENT <p> Mum and Aunty Joan chatted about this and that while I sat there looking as demure as I could . However , Auntie had been looking at my shoes and suddenly said ' Tina that frock really looks so pretty on you . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . However , those shoes really need to be a bit more fashionable to match the rest of your outfit . <p> Can I just have a look at one of your shoes , please ? ' Well , I could hardly refuse , could I ? So I carefully took off my left shoe and handed it to her . She examined it and soon found that it was a size 6B . <p> ' Hmmm ' she said and went out of the lounge leaving me in wonder at what was going to come next . <p> I glanced at my mother who just shrugged her shoulders . Shortly , Auntie Joan reappeared carrying what looked like a small shoebox , which was exactly what it turned out to be , seeing it contained a pair of new-looking black patent court shoes , with pointed toes and heels almost four inches high ! <p> ' Now , Tina ' said Auntie , ' you want to look a bit more grown up , do n't you ? Try these high heels on and see the difference they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore them once and they were a bit too tight for me , but you 've got smaller feet than me and they should fit you perfectly ' . The shoes did indeed look very fashionable and glamourous , but as I 'd been having trouble walking in mere two inch heeled shoes , how would I manage those towering high heels ? <p> However , what could I do but not try them on there and then , without seeming churlish . Secretly , I was hoping they would not fit my feet , but they turned out to be so perfect a fit on my feet that I felt like Cinderella being fitted with the slippers in that folk story . In fact , they were actually slightly wider at the front than the shoes I 'd been fitted with a the shop , so they did n't pinch at all . However , trying to walk in four inch stilettos would surely prove another matter all together <p> Standing up in the high heels seemed easy enough , although I noticed now that I was taller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange how just a pair of shoes can change everything , I thought .

However , it actually seemed easier than I thought it would be , so I took a few more steps before trying to turn around as gracefully as I could . Now that did prove to be almost my undoing , as I nearly lost my balance and had to hold on to the side of the nearby sofa . <p> ' Oops !

However , I was secretly wondering just how the hell I was going to walk home in those towering heels , when I could barely turn around in Auntie 's lounge without grabbing hold of the furniture . At least the flatties I had worn were relatively easy to walk in , despite being a bit tight at the front . These very glamourous-looking court shoes were nicer to wear , but there was no way I could see myself managing to walk over a mile in them , while trying to hang onto my flouncy frock in the breeze . <p> However , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's that twin brother of yours doing , Tina ?

However , I have n't anything by way of a present to give your brother Timmy . ' So she got her purse out of her handbag and gave a couple of pound notes to my mother . ' Here , get Timmy something you know he specially wants . ' Mum smiled at me and said , ' Thanks , Joan I think I know just the thing that Timmy will appreciate .

Mum and I were indeed both grateful , with me even more so . The prospect of wobbling along the pavement for a mile or so in those stilettos while hanging on to my frock to stop the breeze blowing it upwards , was now solved .

On the opening day of Shirley 's shop at the flea market , I was told to take a bath and meet my wife in the bedroom .

In the booth , I had to twirl around and show off the petticoats that Shirley made by hand . She also sold bloomers and I had to model them also . I did see a couple of guys and women from where I work . Needless to say , on Monday I was laughed at and called ' sweetie ' by those men and women .

In that place that was once called , Knowlton Street Welding , I felt that I had just had the most incredible experience of my young life . Those tall thin cylinders of oxygen and acetylene that sat against the wall had never , in their day , produced the heat that I had felt just minutes ago and likely would never feel again . <p> 1956 <p> Standing five feet three in white socks and patent leather shoes , Emily Doyle was the most shy sixteen year old girl imaginable . With big bright green eyes and flawless , translucent skin , she appeared the sultry temptress , but in reality , conducted herself like a demur lady at all times . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling across her pretty shoulders , you would think that she would be a popular girl , but it just was n't so . Cursed with a persistent stutter , Emily was made to suffer ridicule and cruel jokes from so many , small , adolescent minds . Such cruelty angered me and my jingoistic defense of her honor seem to please her , but still , she would never let me close to her . If I were to ask her for a date , she would just shy away and never give me an answer . <p> It was mid-June . The school year had come to an end and I was depressed . My chances of seeing Emily again was pretty slim . She never hung out at the usual places and I never found out where she lived . It looked like it was going to be a long summer . <p> Saturday morning , and I did n't  feel much like going to work , but I made the effort . I caught the Gray Line bus at the corner of Broad and Water Street at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a few blocks before stopping to pick up a passenger at Park street . I perked up immediately upon seeing Emily coming up the steps . In a pretty yellow halter dress with big white polka dots , Emily fumbled through her purse , looking for the necessary change to drop in the stand . As I watched , I could see crabby old women slide about in their seats so that Emily would n't sit next to them and crowd them with her bouffant dress . As for me , I 'd love nothing more then to be crowded by Emilys crinolines ! Waving with one hand , and patting the empty seat , next to me with the other , I caught Emilys attention . She gave me a shy smile as the bus started to move . Her pretty yellow dress swayed sweetly from side to side as she hung on to the seat backs to keep her balance . She made her way down to me , then turned sharply and scooped her dress . Her crinolines rustled as she gently descended to a spot so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet feminine aura of her heavenly body . I reacted as any normal boy would react when Emilys voluptuous skirt came down across my lap .

Granted , not much of a date , but still , I was making progress . <p> Noon came and I ran ! I could n't wait to see her ! As I came to a stop beside her , I was panting like a dog and she giggled at me so sweetly . I had given myself away by appearing anxious to see her . Well , it was the truth and I 'm sure she took it as a genuine compliment . <p> Bennys was quite crowded , but we managed to find ourselves a booth far back away from the crowd . <p> " I 'm kinda hungry . Do you want anything to eat ? " I asked . <p> " Maybe a sa-sa-salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you eat like a bird . But I guess that 's how you keep your beautiful figure .

She gently grabbed me by the hand , and off we went in a direction that meant something to her but remained a mystery to me . We crossed over and headed down Shelton Street , passing a pizzeria and a Polish delicatessen . Again I inquired , " Where are we going ? " <p> But she only smiled and continued to lead me to an unknown destination . We passed under a shady stretch of ancient oak trees , then along a board fence that was covered with old faded ads for motor oil , laundry detergent and Ipana toothpaste . We turned down Knowlton Street , and the course turned industrial as we passed a pencil factory , then a gray iron foundry .

I do n't  understand . I do n't  see anything ! " <p> " Ca-ca come on . " <p> She took my hand , and we walked a few more yards to a place where the chain link fence was rusted and broken . She scooped up her magnificent dress , and with great skill , squeezed through the fence wire without tearing a single thread . I followed her with great curiosity and excitement . <p> " What is this place ? " I asked <p> " M-m-mine ! " She exclaimed , raising her arms to the heavens while turning in all directions . <p> I looked all around and we seemed to be in back of an old abandon business .

The space was well-lit by means of many , dirty , skylights above us . Although mostly a large empty space , there were still some tools and welding tanks about . <p> " Why do you come here ?

You mean they forgot to turn it off ? " <p> " No . I th-th-think its fa-fa-for se-se-security lights . " <p> To my surprise , Emily opened the center desk drawer and carefully , as if handling a new born infant , took out an old , black , 78 record . She turned and lifted the lid on an old phonograph that must have been abandoned by the welding proprietors . I watched as Emily turned the big brown , plastic knob , on the side of the player , all the way up . I heard an obvious , but not objectionable hum coming from the speaker as Emily carefully placed the arm on her mysterious old record . Slowly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanated with all the force that a three tube amplifier could produce . Emily started to sway with the tune as the music filled the barren environment . She emerged from the office door dancing to the tune and I stared , mesmerized by the metamorphose I was witnessing . Was that girl Emily ? Sweet , shy , demure , Emily ? <p> Emily stopped and motioned for me to sit on the concrete floor . I sank down obediently . Emily danced around me with such grace and energy that I was completely captivated . As she danced closer to me she began to twirl her skirt , slowly at first , but then building in speed with every revolution . As her petticoats rose higher and higher , my heart pounded faster and faster as more and more of her luscious legs came into view . Her skin looked so soft and smooth and every curve of her shapely thighs were on display for my pleasure . I licked my lips in anticipation as her petticoats twirled higher !

Then suddenly the music ended and Emily pulled back quickly . She looked at me with a coquettish smile followed by a sweet giggle then turned and dashed back to that phonograph . <p> I said nothing . I was paralyzed ! My mouth just hung open as I watched sweet Emily carefully pick that undulating arm off her precious old 78 record . Mesmerized by her beauty , I watched as she turned away from me and lifted her crinolines . As I wondered what she was doing , she squatted down , and with an awkward motion , she rose up again and lifted her right arm high in the air . In her hand I saw something that made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , she picked up the arm of that old record player and placed it in the starting grove . As the tune filled the room , I could n't breath ! Will she repeat the last performance ? She began to dance as before and I was sweating profusely in anticipation . She began to twirl again and the suspense was killing me ! I began to get flashes of her soft , firm , bottom as she danced closer and closer until , at last , her petticoats twirling high over my head . A small amount of pubic hair did not hide the soft pink lips of her sweet young pussy . I reached up to feel her hips , as I had done before , but as I felt the movement of her supple body against the palms of my hands , the music came to an end , and Emily suddenly stopped . Her petticoats fell all around me and I found myself beneath many layers of crinoline !

With my hands on her firm young bottom , I pulled her toward me until my tongue contacted the soft hot lips of her moist , pouting , pussy .

Completely surrounded by Emilys crinolines , and with my tongue probing , deeply , her soft moist folds , I climaxed all over my pants ! Emily pulled back and adjusted her dress . With a teasing smile , she dashed back to the office . Taking her panties with her , she ran back out and tossed them to me . Then with a sweet little wave , she ran out the door . I just sat there smelling her panties . The record had long ago ended and the arm swayed back and forth , around and around , in that endless last grove . All I could think of was WOW !

Believe me , it 's not as easy as you might think , especially when you 're wearing high heel shoes ! I think I managed it OK , by sitting down sideways and then shifting my feet across , all the time holding my red frock down from billowing up .

I had also learnt how to walk in high heels and get into the back of a car in a flouncy frock , so it had been quite a learning experience one way or the other . I could n't imagine my newfound skills would ever be called on again , but Auntie had said to Mum as they watched me take my first hesitant steps in her lounge , that once you 've learned to walk in heels , you never forget the knack . We were soon outside our house , and it was time for me to try the reverse procedure of getting out of a small car without revealing too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps up our path . <p> 10 . HOME AGAIN AT LAST <p> We turned and waved goodbye to Auntie Joan , and , as I turned back to walk back up the path to the front door I realised I had managed to turn both times in Auntie 's high heels without any problem . Mum followed me up the path and opened the door . We were home at last and my ' modelling adventure ' was over . <p> However , there was the small matter of first sitting down with Mum to discuss the results of my afternoon 's ' modelling ' in Tina 's party frock . ' I was really pleased with your efforts , Timmy , ' said Mum . ' Not a lot of boys of your age would have done what you did today , what with perhaps being called a ' sissy ' if they 'd been found out . But those two louts who wolf-whistled at you as we were waiting to get into Joan 's car were totally fooled , were n't they ? You did really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . When you almost fell over in her lounge after you first tried her shoes on , I thought you had bitten off a bit more than you could chew but you quickly got used to them and I have to admit , they really looked glamourous on you .

' I had to agree <p> However , it was now time to get out of Tina 's frock and all the other feminine finery . I got out of Auntie Joan 's high heels without any trouble , but I needed Mum 's help with the zip at the back of the red party frock . Getting out of a frock is actually more difficult than getting into it , I soon found . Gravity now works against rather than for you <p> But with some help from Mum , the pretty red frock I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and I was now left in my bra , girdle , stockings and , of course , the lacy petticoats .

I 'm sure Tina will be wearing them too when she gets home at the end of the week ! ' <p> So Mum carefully undid the front suspenders on my girdle and I moved left and then right so she could unhitch the side and rear ones . ' You 've done really well , Timmy ' said Mum . ' Wearing such sheer stockings for the first time is not easy . I think I laddered my first pair within barely an hour , when I first tried wearing them . But yours are still perfect ! ' <p> Mum carefully folded my nylons up and put them to the side and then it was just a matter of unzipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out of it . I think the worst single thing I had had to put up with that afternoon was that girdle . Wearing it had been progressively sheerer hell . I had overheard Mum and other ladies talking in the past about their problems with girdles , but now I had found out for myself just what they had been talking about . If I ever heard another lady whispering about her ' girdle killing her , ' I would know only too well from my personal experience just what she was talking about . <p> Finally , I was just left with the padded panties , and they came down very easily to leave me wearing my own briefs only . I was finally free of all that feminine frippery , and could get dressed in my own clothes again . <p> ' What are you going to do with all the underclothes and those shoes Miss Fotheringale got for me to put on , Mum ? ' I asked . ' Surely Tina wo n't be needing to wear those padded bra and briefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wo n't ' replied Mum . ' Maybe you could pop them into Miss Fotheringale 's shop one afternoon for me , would you ? ' <p> ' OK , Mum ' I replied . ' What about the shoes , too ? ' <p> Mum thought for a bit and then said , ' Well , Tina is old enough now to be wearing high heels and if you could manage wearing them , then she should also be able to without any problems . So I 'll package up these low-heeled ones and they can go back to the shop too . We 'll just have to hope that Tina is as good walking in her first high heels as you were today , Timmy ! ' <p> Discussions then moved on to the amount of money I now had compiled towards my new racing bike , which Mum was holding on my behalf . Clearly today 's modelling had increased the total quite a bit , but I was still short by a small amount of the almost 50 Pounds that the Claude Butler bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my newspaper delivery round , and I reckoned that additional 30 shillings would just be enough to make that magic 50 quid . And so it turned out ! On Friday , I got my weekly wages from the newsagents at just after 4PM . Of course , I had to return the package of the now unwanted frillies and the shoes into Miss Fotheringales Salon , but that only took a minute . I certainly was n't going to hang around there , just in case they needed me for some more modelling duties ! <p> I then rushed down the High Street to Charlie 's Cycles to pay the money for the bicycle of my dreams , having already been given the rest of it from my cycle savings fund by Mum . I rode the new bike back home as quickly as I could , avoiding the temptation to go via the local hill for a bit of showing off . Besides , it looked like it was going to rain <p> At 7.15 PM , Tina was due in on the train from London at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet her . I carried her bags to a taxi and we headed home .

Moreover , boys who see girls dressed in either way will see no reason to respect them as girls or young women , at least in a lot of cases .

@@37517963 @6517963/ <h> LITTLE MISTAKES <p> Over the next week , Mother and Tess provided a crash course on behaving as a young girl should . There was considerable attention to keeping my skirts in mind , so as not to display too much to casual observers . It almost took some of the pleasure of wearing a skirt awaywell , not really . At night , I had to get accustomed to not wearing pajamas ! The nightgowns were so shiny and slick andwell , wonderful to me , that I had difficulty letting myself just drift off to sleep . Over time of course , I got used to the feeling and soon was relaxed and comfortable with the newness . <p> I had several sets of panties with all the days of the week embroidered on them . I actually wondered why , but got no answers from either of my teachers at the time . Later , I did take some pleasure in occasionally putting on the wrong daysort of a mini rebellion to being trained to be a good girl ? I took pleasure in knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when I had n't  paid the proper attention to my skirt and heard my mother behind me asking just exactly why I thought it was Sunday ! Oops ! <p> One afternoon they broke the news : We were all going out . I remember thinking out loud they must be kidding ! After a few minutes , Mother led me to a full length mirror in the front of Tesss store and stood me in front of it . " Nowwhat do you see in that mirror ? " She asked seriously . I lookedand looked . What I saw was me , wearing girls ' clothes ! Wellnot really me but <p> " What I see is a frightened little girlbut a girl nonetheless ! Look very closely now " My mind said it was mewearing a dress . My eyes saw a girl . Butit was me , after allI was so confused about what I was doing ! Over the next hour or so , though , Mother made it clear I was n't getting out of leaving the privacy and safety of the confines I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out and change into a different dress . Tess fixed my hair just right , and Mother took my hand as we walked slowly out the door . Even though I had slowly become more confident over the past week while inside , going out into the world wasfrightening ! <p> Ill always remember feelingso exposed ! We walked to the car and Mother let my hand go so she could get her keys out . I suddenly felt a bit nervous standing alone as she unlocked her door and got in . She reached over to unlock the passenger door and I quickly opened the door and started to get in . Mother stopped me , reminding me it would be appropriate for me to sit in the back and let Tess take the front seat . I stopped , turned around and moved out of the door opening to offer the seat to Tess . I was so nervous ! But Tess , sensing my concern , leaned in , reached around and unlocked the back passenger side door . " Thank you , dear , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  mind ? " As she slowly slid into the car my manners sort of took over and I actually closed her door for her . What was I thinking ? I was now ALONE , in front of everyone ! Wearing a dress ! I quickly moved to get myself into the car without thinking what they had been teaching me only that day ! Somehow I managed to stop myself , gather my thoughts , and turn slightly , sitting on the seat . Keeping my knees together , I swiveled myself in and quickly yanked the door closed ! The exposed feeling was certainly magnified being outside like I was , and I clearly understood the skirt training lessons with a much greater appreciation ! Whew ! Mother just smiled . <p> Feeling a little more safe in the car , I tried to relax while Mother drove us to a nice restaurant . Getting back out of the car was even more nerve wracking , but I managed . As we began to walk , Mother once again took my hand and reassured me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! What if SHE had to wear a dress in public ! Oh But , as we walked along the sidewalk , we passed several people andnobody seemed to stare at me . I even began to feel sort ofconfident ! Finally , we approached the door of the restaurant Mother had decided on . A man standing outside quickly opened the door and we all walked in . As we passed through , I heard him distinctly say , " Have a wonderful evening ladies . " Wow ! <p> After we were seated , and drinks were ordered ( wella Coke for me ) , Mother suggested She and I go wash our hands . And sooff to the ladies room . Oh my goodnessis there no end ? While we were in there , she suggested I might be wise to do something elsejust to get used to it , and reminded me quietly to sit . All I could think at that instant wasMOTHER ! But I have to admit I might have forgotten under the circumstances of my nervous state . How embarrassing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt a bit of fear walking out in view of everyone ! Butagain , no one seemed to pay any attention . Wow ! Again ! By the end of our dinner , I often glanced around to see who was looking at me and snickering butI was almost sure someone would , but .. no one was staring at me . <p> Walking back to the car was a little less scary , I think . I even shocked myself a little when , walking past an angled window , I saw my reflection and was about to look behind me to get a better look at that girl and her beautiful dress , and maybe even get a glimpse of a petticoat . Then it occurred to me that I was the girlandit was my dress ! I actually stopped and slightly raised my skirt in frontjust to see my own petticoat ! It waswonderful ! <p> The outings became more frequent over the next few days , and especially during the daylight hours ! Each of the lessons were aimed at changing a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own confidence was improving . What I found most interesting was that , after even that short a time , the clothes all started to feelnot unusual ? Perhaps I was getting used to them , but it was still all very special to me ! At the same time , I did n't  feel soout of place appearing in public . My movements were getting more girlish and I began to feel more and more free to be that way ! For the first timeI was n't having to hide anything ! <p> But thenmy stay with Tess was over . I had grown very close to her in those few weeksbut what a filled few weeks it was ! She had taken me from a boy who liked to play dress-up with his mothers clothes to a young ladyat least in appearance and behavior . It really was a sad day when I had to say goodbye to her . She waswell sort of a second mother , I guess . This photo is one Tess had taken just before we left . She sent me a copy much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we drove away , Mother told me there were several suitcases in the back of the car filled with more new clothes for me . " It will reinforce the illusion I have picked you up from your trip , see ? I thought it was pretty smart myself , young lady " And she smiled . <p> On the way home that day , I remember having mixed emotions . That old fear had slowly crept back into my brain . What if someone recognized me ? What if everyone figured out who I really was ? And as we pulled into our driveway , my biggest fear was standing right there by the mailboxesMrs . Adams ! Mother just reminded me I was her niece and a very well behaved young lady . " Do n't  worry , and youre too pretty to be wrinkling your brow like that " And she smiled at me . <p> As Mother got out of the car , I slowly opened my door . Recalling all my recent lessons , I got out as gracefully as I could and inched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward the back of the car , Mrs. Adams was standing therelooking me over with her infamous eagle eyesOh no !

" She had thatsmileon her face and I was just waiting . Suddenly , she held out her hand and introduced herself . Nervously , I took her hand and , as I had sort of remembered , greeted her and introduced myself as CatherineAunt Margys niece . <p> She just stared for a second , then quickly moved her hand to my hair and felt it . I thought for sure she was onto the disguise , but she just commented on what lovely hair I had , and how much it looked like Mothers hair . Why I did n't  just scream and run , I 'll never know to this day ! 
@@37517964 @6517964/ <p> In this section I give methods that rely on machine sewing . BE CAREFUL ! Please follow all instructions and safety precautions given in the manual for your sewing machine . Proceed at Your Own RISK ! <p> <p> CHOOSING THE PETTICOAT FOR YOUR PROJECT <p> Petticoats that have a plain flat lace in a color that matches the petticoat can be further enhanced by adding a contrasting or complementing color lace not only at the hem , but at each seam between the tiers and at the bottom of the yoke as well . If you add a different color lace over existing lace on a petticoat one thing you can do is add the new lace a little above the existing lace so the existing lace peaks out below the new lace . Another thing you can do with lace at the hem of a petticoat is to use it to make the petti a little longer . In this case , you would want to add the lace to the hem of all of the layers in the petticoat . You can also add lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hem . This will take longer to do than other petticoats because , while adding lace at the hem , you will need to pause sewing every two or three inches to be sure the rusching is clear of your sewing . This works out nice in the end because the rusching poufs up the lace a little . The petticoat I did for this article was a plain white chiffon petti with rusching at the hem ( See the " Before " picture below ) . When decorating a petticoat that has leader line in the hems , be sure to sew the lace at the hem so it is above the leader line . DO N'T take a chance on the needle striking the leader line . <p> BEFORE <p> SELECTING LACE <p> There are some styles and colors of lace and other trims are available in widths of up to 6 inches . Many kinds of trim are available that can be applied in the same way as lace . There a few samples shown in figure 1 ( below ) . The prices of lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that many kinds and styles of lace are NOT intended for use on garments . They are for use in crafts . I 've never tried using craft lace on a garment ; I suspect that it would not wash well and the color may run too . Many times a store will sell both kinds of lace and trim materials and it can be hard to tell which is which . Sometimes I have seen spools that say " Not for use on garments " on the label . Many of the garment trim materials also have washing instructions on the spool label . Generally , the craft materials are less expensive than those intended for garment use . Beware : a bargain trim material may not turn out to be a bargain after you have it on the garment . On the other hand , I 've seen some craft trims that were very expensive and not intended for garment use , so price wo n't always lead in the right direction either . If you ca n't tell if the lace you want is really for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get enough lace : The petti I decorated for this project took 30 and 1/2 yards of lace . I bought 33 yards . This lace was relatively inexpensive at $.69/yard . I think you 'll agree that you do n't want to buy a bunch more than you 'll need . Running out before the job is done can be bad as well . Lace color varies from batch to batch and if you have to go back for more , the color may not match exactly . Also , some of the most fancy trims may not be readily available if the store has less than you need to finish . Getting the length right is the best bet all the way around ( he he he- a small funny ) . I use a 6 foot ( 2 yard ) cloth measuring tape . Measuring the distance around the yoke seam and the middle seam(s) is pretty easy , because they will usually lay flat . The hem never lays flat so , here 's a good way measure the hem : Put a safety pin someplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This pin marks the place where you start measuring along the edge of the hem with a cloth or flexible plastic measuring tape . Start at the pin , and measure along the hem until you are at the end of the tape . Hold that place on the hem while you pull the tape ahead to start measuring again at the place you 're holding . Keep repeating the process until you 're all the way around the hem , back to the pin . Keep a running total of the length as you go . I had done petti 's like this before so I knew the answer was about 30 yards , and I just measured the hem very quickly to be sure this was the same size petti I had done before . The quick hem measurement came out 27 yards , so I just went ahead and bought the same length I bought before ( 33 yards ) . <p> CHOOSING THREAD <p> In this case , I was adding red lace to a white petticoat . I did NOT want the thread or stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used white thread in the bobbin so there would n't be colored stitches on the inside on the seam . I used red thread that matches the lace for the needle thread so the top stitches would blend in with the lace . <p> SEWING THE LACE ON THE PETTICOAT <p> I always start at the back of the petticoat , so the seam where the two ends of the lace join is least visible . To save space , I wo n't repeat all the basic sewing stuff I covered in the first sewing section . Do NOT precut lengths of lace for each seam you 're going to cover . Just put your lace in your lap or on the floor and feed the free end up to the front of your sewing machine . In the case of a nylon chiffon petti , you can sew the lace right on the seam . I have even done this using a small zigzag stitch . This way the lace will help reinforce the seam . Chiffon petticoats tend to come apart at the seams . With organza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly above the seam . This way the seam still makes a nice guide to help you keep the lace at the same height all the way around the petticoat . This also avoids having to sew through several layers of tough material . When you 're all the way around the seam , back to where you started , sew the lace over the start edge for about 1/4 inch so they overlap a little . Then end your line of sewing as usual . Now cut the lace supply free of the seam you just completed . Be careful not to cut the threads that are holding the lace to the seam . The big secret of success is to go slow . I usually sew no more than 3 inches before I stop and check to be sure everything is going like I want it to . Part of this is working the lace to keep it uncurled so it enters under the presser foot flat and on the seam . It 's a good thing we have lots of fingers . You will find yourself using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petti , smooth the lace onto the seam , and keep rusching out of the way . I took about four hours to do the machine sewing for the petti shown below . <p> FINISHING TOUCHES <p> As you have started and ended each line of sewing you have left threads dangling . Find them and trim them to about 1/2 inch long . Why ? I like 1/2 inch . At each place where the lace overlaps at the start and end of sewing on each seam there are 2 raw edges of the lace that need to be sewn to the lace they overlap ( see figure 2 ) . <p> Note that each edge needs to be sewn down right where it lays . Do n't try to sew the two raw edges together . The result of such an attempt would be ugly . I do this sewing by hand . Use the color of thread that matches the lace . Start in the seam so the thread knot will have a good hold and sew the raw edge to the lace it is laying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the section on mending . When you 've sewn out to the bottom of the lace sew your way back on the same path using the same stitch . When you reach the seam tie off the thread , and cut the needle thread free . Now sew down the other raw edge that 's on the other side of the lace 1/4 inch away . Continue like this until you have sewn down all the raw edges of the lace . This part took about two hours for the petti shown . Well take a look at the " After " picture to see how the petti turned out . Notice how the stiffness of the lace makes the petticoat a little fuller . 
@@37517965 @6517965/ <p> My earliest recollection was that I secretly wanted to look like my oldest sister , who had very pretty and frilly clothes , while I had extremely plain and dull clothing as a boy . At that time , all I could do was dream , and look at all the pretty , poufy underthings . <p> One day , I was helping my mother clean the attic when she discovered a box of clothing . The contents proved to be full of my sister 's clothing which she had outgrown . In going through the box , we discovered it contained mostly old petticoats , camisoles , and panties in all sorts of colors . There were , I remember , a couple of very frilly party dresses and other various items of clothing . I was enthralled by the clothing , especially after my mother casually remarked that she believed most , if not all , the items would fit me . <p> The box was put in a closet , and I pretty much forgot about it . One day , I was playing outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear . After I had undressed and bathed , my mother announced that I had no clothing to wear , as I had played extra hard that week and soiled all of my playclothes and wash day was n't for at least three days . <p> After talking about the dilemma , I hesitatingly suggested we look in the forgotten box and see if there was something there I could wear on a temporary basis . This was a totally innocent suggestion . I had no motive in the suggestion at all , other than helping my frazzled mother with a problem . <p> To my surprise , she accepted the idea , and we retrieved the box from its resting place in the closet . We opened it and began to take inventory of the contents . To me , everything in the box resembled lovely butterflies , and , as I helped remove the items , I was filled with something I had not really experienced before . <p> After emptying the box , my mother ( my sister was at an outing ) sorted through the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lace on the legs and a rabbit embroidered on the front . I was n't really sure what she wanted me to do until she directed me to put the panties on . I hesitated , and she assured me I was n't being punished , and no one else would know , so I slipped them on . <p> I could n't believe the wonderful feeling that washed over me as I stood looking at my reflection in the mirror . It did n't really occur to me that I was actually wearing a pair of girl 's panties , all I knew was they felt very , very good on my young body . <p> My mother then made a suggestion that maybe , just for fun , she would dress me in one of the party dresses , fix my quite long hair , and we could be mother and daughter for the rest of the day . As she dressed me , pulling the very short , full petticoat over my head , then the pretty party dress , my young mind seemed to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along -- a girl . " <p> The Mary Janes went on after the frilly sox ; then my mother fixed my hair in two ponytails , one on each side of my head . She curled my hair , then put large bows on each one . When I finally stood in front of the mirror , she exclaimed that I looked very cute , more girl than boy . I was enthralled with the thought . <p> We spent the day as mother and daughter , even going shopping . No one ever guessed that I was the young daughter . I felt like I was on " cloud nine . " <p> For bedtime , mother asked if I wanted to wear a nightie . When I stammered , " Yes , " she produced one of my sister 's short babydoll nighties with matching panties . When I went to bed , she kissed me , something she hardly did , and said she had really enjoyed spending the day with her youngest daughter . <p> When I awoke the next day and looked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the room a little later , she expressed surprise that I was still wearing the nightie and panties and said she had assumed I would want to be a boy as soon as I can .

There was just one slight particular that made it somewhat different . Four year old Maryanne Beliveau was really four year old Timmy Beliveau . <p> A FEMININE IMPERATIVE <p> 1957 <p> It takes a " special breed of cat " to be able to write books for children . But following her divorce , Marie Beliveau found out that she did indeed have such a talent . She was able to make a very comfortable living for herself with her own books and as a consultant for childrens school textbooks . <p> Marie and her only child , a little nine year old boy , lived in a large house in a charming section of a small New England town . At first she had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would often pause in her work and look over at him as he played on the floor and study him . He had such delicate features for a boy . It was almost as if he had started to develop as a girl , and then , just before being born , had become a boy . <p> He was so cute ! It was n't long before she began to wonder what he would be like if he was a girl . Soon she stopped getting his hair cut . It was such pretty golden hair . Towards the end of the school year she received two separate letters from teachers advising her to get him a haircut since its length was causing some of the other boys to tease him . She tore up both notes . The next year at school brought more letters , and Timmy confessed he had a little fight with a boy that had picked on him . When this school year finished , she received a phone call from the principal telling her that Timmy would not be allowed in school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew her ideas about Timmy were silly . After all , he ran around outside with the other boys , got the usual amount of boyish dirt on himself , and showed a normal interest in the things boys like . But still Soon she began to consider the idea of dressing him up just to see what hed look like as a girl . But Timmy always answered her with a definite " No " , whenever she half seriously asked him if hed like to be a girl . <p> Only oncefive years agohad she actually put him in a pretty little dress , supposedly just as part of a Sunday afternoons fun . It seemed so long ago . The pressure of her work kept her from exploring the idea any further , but those occasional pauses and glances at him kept it in her mind . That was due in part , no doubt , not only because of Timmys delicate appearance , but also to the fact that she had really wanted a girl when she was pregnant . But her writing schedule made such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate to him as she could to make sure they had a good mother / child relationship . <p> A day came shortly after Timmy started his 1957 summer vacation when Marie received a very good offer from a publishing company to work at a daily schedule of her choosing in the editing , production and consulting of a series of childrens books the company wanted to market . It was something that would require her to commit herself for a specified amount of time at the start.away from home . Shed be gone a month while she studied and worked on the books in the companys New York City office . <p> The problem was what to do with Timmy . She could n't take him with her , and her choices of who she could leave him with were extremely limited . Her own folks were far away in Florida , quite elderly , and lived in a small apartment . But that left only one other person she could leave him with : her sister Corinne . <p> Corinne Beliveau was an altogether different type of woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divorced and had gone back to legally using their maiden name . But all resemblance stopped there . Where Marie was affectionate with children , Corinne kept them at a distance , especially boys for whom she had an almost loathsome regard . Girls were alright , as long as they had been taught to be proper little ladies . Marie enjoyed her work . Corinne would n't work , nor did she have to , thanks to a lop-sided property settlement and a huge amount of alimony she received from her ex-husband , a highly successful plastic surgeon with a wandering eye . Maries friends were from all levels of society . Corinnes friends all came from the " upper crust " . <p> Her main interest in life seemed to be keeping herself in the most fashionable clothes , and generally behaving like a social butterfly , a snobbish butterfly . She had decided on a life style she wanted and stuck to it with little if any variation . Her days and nights were filled with the country club , soirees and cocktail parties , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one maid that came in two or three times a week to help her keep her home immaculate , a lovely old Victorian house just a few doors away from her sisters , and filled with antiques which were her only other interest . <p> Marie sighed , not looking forward to asking her to take care of Timmy for a month , but seeing no other choice . She called her up and asked her if she could stop over for a few minutes during the afternoon . Corinne reluctantly said shed be there at two oclock sharp , and Marie knew she meant it to the minute . Corinne was punctual in the extreme . <p> At precisely 1:59 Corinne parked her 1952 Lincoln Continental in Maries driveway , and at 2:00 sharp knocked on the door . <p> Marie greeted her at the door and Corinne , looking stylish as ever , entered quietly , having a deep suspicion that she was about to be asked a favor , a favor she would most likely find distasteful to her life style and inconvenient to her daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door for privacy . She had n't  told Timmy she was going away for a month yet , and she thought it best to get things nailed down before she did so . <p> She looked over at the flawless way Corinne wore her sheath dress , a perfect fit , no doubt obtained with the additional skills of her own seamstress . Most of Corinnes outfits had a tailored appearance to them . Frills werent important to her . Line , drape , and fit were everything . <p> Corinne observed her sister coolly . Marie always followed the herd when it came to fashion . She dressed in such ultra feminine style . Soft fabrics with pretty prints and full skirts with petticoats poufing them out . Sometimes Corinne found it hard to believe they were sisters . <p> Marie took a deep breath and began to tell Corinne about her situation . Corinne sat there , smoking a cigarette and not saying anything . It was just as she had thoughta favor was needed . Finally , Marie paused and then asked , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the month ? " <p> Corinne did n't  answer right away . She uncrossed her shapely legs and leaned forward slightly as she stubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray . <p> Then she looked at Marie . <p> " Do you remember a conversation we had about two months ago ? " asked Corinne . " You were talking about Timmy then also . You were curious what hed look like as a girl . You said you often wished hed been a girl . " <p> " Yes , " answered Marie , " but what has that got to do with this ? " <p> " Marie , you know my feelings about children , " said Corinne . " They just do n't  fit into my life . Especially little boys . I know you love little Timmy , but really , dear , little boys are such horrid creatures . Always getting dirty , loud and clumsy and generally poorly behaved ; frequently an embarrassment when you take them out anywhere . <p> " Now I realize how important this contract offer is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I 'll do . " Marie leaned forward , beginning to feel that perhaps her sister was about to relent in her usual " rules " for her own life . <p> " I 'll let Timmy stay with me for one month , and at the end of that time when you return , you 'll find out what kind of girl he could have been . " <p> " What do you mean ? " asked Marie , a little puzzled . <p> " I mean , " replied Corinne , " that as soon as he moves in with me he starts to dress and behave like a girl . I simply cant have a boy living in my house for a month . I 'll train him to be a nice young lady . And that 's the only way he gets to stay with me . Thats final . Take it or leave it . " <p> " Oh , Corinne ! " said Marie . " You could n't do that to him.for an entire month ? ! " <p> " Why not ? asked her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even begin to like it . And I think you 'll find his behavior will be definitely improved when you return . " Marie did n't  say anything for a few moments , thinking about how Timmy would look as a girl . <p> " But do n't  you think it might be bad for him ? " said Marie . <p> " Bad for him ? ! " exclaimed Corinne . " My dear sister , let me remind you of a couple of basic facts of life : women are better than men , and little girls are better than little boys . Youll be able to see just how nice a little girl I can turn him into when you get back . And if your conscience bothers you , you can always put him back into his disgusting jeans and tee shirts . " <p> Again Marie fell silent for a bit . She thought of her curiosity that had been growing on the idea of Timmy dressed as a girl . Perhaps it would n't really be that bad for him . <p> " Corinne , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh ? What is it ? " <p> " Wellits the difference in our manner , " replied Marie . " I 've always been so affectionate with him . But I cant for the life of me see you showing him much affection . He might begin to feel unwanted or even unloved . " <p> " Oh , Marie ! He s a child ! He s a lot more flexible than you realize . And as regards affection , well yes , I would be demanding in my training of him , but I 'd also give him compliments and rewards for being a nice little girl . I 'm not completely made out of ice , despite what you may think of me . Who knows ? As a little girl he may even bring out an affectionate side of me that I did n't  know I had . I do like little girls , as long as they 're well behaved . " <p> " Well , " sighed Marie , " I suppose we could try it , and if things do n't  work out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Theres just two other things you have to agree to , " said Corinne . <p> " What 's that ? " asked Timmys mother . <p> " First , " replied Corinne , " you do n't  have to tell him what I 'm going to do , but I do want you to tell him that he has to make a big change when he comes to live with me , that you know what the change is , and that you want him to do it . Second , if he acts naughty or refuses to obey me or is rude , I want your permission right now to be able to spank him with my hairbrush , and I want you to tell him that , too . " <p> " Oh , my God ! " said Marie . " Spank my little Timmy with a hairbrush ? ! " <p> " Do n't  get so upset , " said Corinne . " Most likely it will never happen . I would imagine after the gentle affectionate way you 've treated him , just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Marie again fell silent as she thought about it all . One thing was clear : she had no option . There really was n't anyone else she could leave him with . <p> " Wellalright , " she said at last . <p> " Good . Thats settled , " said Corinne . " Now call him in here and let 's give him an idea of what 's in store , and how you want him to promise to do as I say . I want you to tell him that you think it will be good for him , and also that you agree that I should spank him if he s naughty . " <p> Marie nodded slowly , got up just as slowly , and went to the door . She knew Timmy was probably playing with his Lincoln Logs on the floor outside her library . <p> " Timmy.come in here , honey . There 's something we have to tell you . " <p> When they all left the library Timmy was puzzled . He wondered what they had meant by a " big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was , just saying hello and then usually ignoring him . But this time she had also asked him if he understood what his mommy was telling him . He had nodded his head , but still felt puzzled about it all . He wished his mommy did n't  have to go away for a month . Timmy was actually nine years and six months old , and as Corinne looked at him , she made a mental note that a girls size ten dress would probably fit him . <p> She picked up her purse , made a sort of mechanical smile at Timmy and said goodbye to her sister . <p> " I 'll pick him up on the morning after tomorrow , " she said . " And do n't  worry . Everything will go fine . "

@@37517970 @6517970/ <p> I was an only child and had to be put in foster care until old enough to be left alone until my mom got home from work . There were three other boy boarders and a daughter of the foster parents . She was about a year older than me . Over the early years , I became fascinated and curious as to how it would feel to be a girl , plus I was attracted to her beautiful , colorful dresses . I especially loved the way the skirts would sway when she walked and wondered what it would feel like to wear a pretty dress too . Then one night , after everyone had gone to bed , I snuck down stairs and retrieved one of the daughters dresses from a back room . Quickly removing my pajamas , I slipped the dress over my head and pulled it down into place . It was magical , as the dress not only fit me , but I felt I fit the dress . <p> Suddenly , the lights came on , and there stood the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . " What do you think you 're doing in that dress ? " , she asked in a threatening tone . <p> I was immediately terrified , as I stuttered , " I just wanted to see what it felt like . " <p> Without hesitation , she came over and started to lift the dress over my head , while scolding me for sneaking around when I should be in bed . I was shaking now , as I reached over to reclaim my pajamas . " Leave those there ! " , she snapped as she grabbed my arm and pulled me to the doorway . " You wanted to see what it feels like to be a girl and that is just what 's going to happen . " <p> Dragging me back upstairs in just my underpants , she stopped me in front of her daughters room and told me to wait . I was really scared now , not knowing what she was going to do . A few minutes later , she returned and held out one of her daughters night gowns . Handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while saying this is what girls wear to bed , not a dress . When I just stood frozen , she grabbed the gown and slipped it over my head and let it fall into place . I was crying now as I felt so humiliated and ashamed of wearing a girl 's frilly night gown . I can still remember her chuckling while telling me what a pretty little girl I made . <p> Again grabbing my arm , she led me back to my room where the other boys were still asleep . I pleaded for her to stop as she shoved me into the room and woke the others . " I want you all to meet our new boarder , " she announced , as the boys rubbed their eyes and stared in disbelief . I started to bawl now as she introduced me as Nancy and said I would be visiting for a while . She then ordered me into bed and told the others to go back to sleep , saying theyd have plenty of time to get acquainted in the morning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pulled my covers up to hide my sissy condition . She then told me I was to remain in bed in the morning until she came to let me up . Turning out the lights , she left me dizzy with uncertainty at my upcoming fate . <p> As promised , she came and woke everyone for breakfast . After sending them down stairs , she told me to wait for her return . I sat at the edge of my bed trying to think of what doom would befall me next . My question was answered the moment she returned and I saw a complete outfit of her daughters clothes draped across her arms . Ordering me to stand up , she placed the clothes on my bed and told me to remove my gown . I burst into tears as I pleaded forgiveness with promises I 'd never try her daughters clothes on again . " Oh ! I think you will , and we can start right now . " Handing me a pair of panties , she told me to change into them or I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as told as I removed my underwear and slipped the panties up my legs . Though they were plain cotton , the fact they were meant for a girl stirred tremendous feelings of shame as I pulled them into place . My heart began to race when I saw the next item she retrieved from the bed and held it out for me to put on . It was a very full , white petticoat slip adorned with satin ribbons around the hem . Grabbing her shoulder , I stepped into the opening while she pulled it up to my waist . <p> My head was spinning wildly now as I watched the next item held out for my acceptance . It was the most beautiful , ruffled dress I 'd ever seen . It was totally feminine with lace trimmed sleeves and skirt , not to mention the satin ribbon waist sash . The material was some sort of chiffon with small pink roses printed all around the full skirt . They started small at the waist and became larger as they descended to the hemline . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was meant for a much younger girl . Once in place , I could n't see my feet from the billowing petticoats and dress , and really felt strange . Having me sit on the edge of the bed , she slipped some socks on my feet and told me I 'd have to wear my own shoes as she did n't  have any girls shoes that would fit . Just hearing her say girls shoes stirred a strange sensation through me as I stared at the skirt bunched up around my legs . <p> I was led down the hall and into her daughters room where she took a satin ribbon and after a bit of combing , fastened it in my hair . " There ! Now you look like a proper young lady . " I again started to cry to have my own clothes back but she just reminded me , " You said you wanted to see what it felt like to be a girl . Now you will get your chance . " Taking my hand , she led me to the stairs while telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised to see how cute you look " , she giggled , showing her own pleasure at my demise . The moment we entered the kitchen , the boys and her daughter burst into laughter . I just stood frozen and cried out of control . Having me sit down for breakfast , she explained what happen the night before and that this was just to give me my wish . <p> Everyone eventually settled down as I struggled to eat , being so emotionally upset . As soon as everyone finished , the foster mother ordered them outside to play . I looked up at her with pleading eyes as she said , " You too ! And be careful not get your pretty dress dirty . " <p> I was horrified that she was carrying this so far , pleading to stay inside . " You wanted to see what it felt like to be a girl and so you shall . Now get yourself up and join the others until lunch time . " I was really shaking as she directed me to the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank as I heard the door close behind me and heard the click of the lock . I was the center of attention the whole morning , with the older boys constantly flipping my skirts , wanting to see if I was wearing panties . My large petticoats helped keep their prying eyes from furthering my shame as I constantly pushed them down , surprised at how vulnerable girls ' clothes were and the effort it took to keep modest . <p> ' <p> By lunch , the novelty was wearing off and the boys had settled down . Though I still felt embarrassed being in a dress , I was also beginning to enjoy the feeling of the flouncy , soft fabrics against my legs . Secretly , I was fascinated with the way the skirt would bounce when I walked though I could never let anyone know . Lunch gratefully went without much teasing and afterwards I again pleaded to stay inside . To my surprise , she said , " Very well . Then you can help me clear the table and with washing the dishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than being tormented by the other kids . I was beginning to actually feel like a girl in a strange sort of way and kind of liked it . When at the sink , she tied an apron on me , while telling me it was to protect my dress . Hearing her say to protect MY DRESS " , stirred very strange sensations in me , as though I 'd actually become a real girl . <p> After the chores were done , I went into the living room and sat down to gather my thoughts . It was n't very long when her daughter came in and sat beside me . I wanted to be left alone but had no where to go as I tried to ignore her . " How do you like wearing a dress ? " she asked in a non aggressive tone . <p> " Its O.K. , " I replied , not knowing what else to say . <p> " You look really pretty in it , " she responded , as I began to feel uneasy . " Want to come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can play . " <p> As awkward as I felt , I thought it might be better than just sitting , bored . " I-I-I guess , " I said nervously , though also fascinated at the prospect of playing as though a real girl . As we climbed the stairs , I had trouble with the full skirts and she showed me how to gather them up . It was like a fantasy dream as we entered her room and I looked around . The room was truly all girl , with dolls , stuffed animals , etc. everywhere . Showing me a small table and chairs , I sat down while she retrieved a Sorry ' game . <p> We played several games all afternoon and it was n't very long before I felt as though I had actually been turned into a girl . I LOVED IT ! That is until I needed to use the bathroom . I did n't  know what to do with so much skirt in the way . I told her my plight and she described how I was to handle the skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with me so I struggled a bit before managing to finish . I never realized how cumbersome a girls skirts an be . I stayed in her room all afternoon until we heard her mother call us for dinner . Again , she showed me how to handle my skirts as we descended the stairs . The boys could n't help notice how friendly WE GIRLS had become and giggled all through dinner . After the table was cleared , the mother ordered me upstairs with her close behind . " Well , how did you like being a girl for the day ? " she asked . <p> I was nervously fearing she would keep me like this again tomorrow as I told her I did n't  like it . <p> " Do you think you will want to try on a dress again ? " I began to shake again as I firmly said , " NO ! " " Very well then . Let 's get you undressed and back into your own clothes . But if I ever catch you trying on girls ' clothes again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good . Do you understand ? " Her words terrified me as I nodded I understood . <p> I never tried on a dress again while at that boarding house , though I often dreamt of that very special day and wished I could . It was several years later , when I was alone , before I again felt the wonderful sensations of a flowing skirt about my legs . I knew then that I will always harbor a part of me as that little girl I experienced that magical day . I sometimes wonder if these feelings would have become such a part of me if that woman had n't  giving me a chance to see what it would be like to have been a girl . Thank you , foster mother . Thanks for the memories and a life wrapped in soft , heavenly dresses .

I have been a Maid now for as far back as I can remember and have been cross-dressing even longer than that . I am very fortunate to have met my Wife who is also my Mistress , who shares my passion of us boys cross-dressing to be " Special Girls " and actively encourages me , and helps me in every way to be that naughty little Sissy Girlie Maid that I always long to be .

Having been first introduced to them by my elder sister who back in the 50s was always wandering around the house in just her bra , panties , suspenders and stockings , high heels and always with a gorgeous fully frilled and flared pouf style petticoat , and I was always jealous of her being able to wear such lovely clothes , but she did sense that I always watched her , and my feelings about what she wore and teased it out of me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used to dress me up as one of the girls when her friends came round , even putting me into stockings and high heels and a gorgeous pair of frilly knickers that she especially bought for just me to wear on these special occasions .

But what put the icing on the cake was when I was first laced up into my tight little waspie corset and dressed in all my new Girlie clothes stockings etc. , my makeup applied , my hair done , when my mother gave me two boxes , and inside were two pairs of lovely new stilettos with 5 inch heels , I was now a true Girl and my sister and friends looked upon me as nothing else but a girl when I was dressed , and I had three gorgeous years of being a girl wearing lovely Girlie clothes especially the pouf style petticoats and stockings , plus venturing out on the rare occasions with my sister and her friends , but those are other adventures . Then , as usual when growing up , things changed as did my circumstances and not so much dressing was forthcoming in my direction . Then came marriage , which turned sour , and onto my present Wife , who was I am sure was sent to me from heaven . So I am lucky that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me in my pouf style uniforms showing off my frilly knickers etc , and I love doing so and adore wearing stockings and those masses of petticoats all day . <p> If it is of any interest I met my Wife some 25 years ago after my failed marriage due to my cross-dressing . She invited me to a fancy dress party that she was hosting after the break up of my marriage . And , having just gone through a messy divorce , I was feeling somewhat low and was not going to go , but I received a little note from her saying that it was a pity , as she wanted a Maid to serve at the party and thought that I would be interested in filling that position - so somehow she had found out I liked to dress as a French Maid through my Wife . I later found out so how many more people did previous my wife tell , I will never know ? Though a bit shocked that someone else knew of my secret , I thought , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during my divorce , so I will take this opportunity to go out in public and wear my Maid 's uniform and come out of the closet for the evening and go as a French Maid . <p> So I dolled myself up , put on my only French Maids outfit at the time , and turned up at the party wearing a little short black dress , frilly knickers suspenders and stockings high heels the lot , and at first got a mixed reaction , but the Hostess of the party sensed I had dressed like that before and asked me if I would like to be a Maid for the evening and serve the drinks to her guests , so how could I refuse ? So there I was , tottering around on my high heels , showing off my frilly knickers every time I bent over , and then the Hostess beckoned me over and ordered me to fetch her a drink , and with a sly smile on her face dealt me a hefty slap across my backside as I turned to fetch her drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receiving a slap every time . At the end of the evening , the Hostess , my future Wife , passed me a note telling me to give her a call the following weekend , as she wanted to see me again , so I did , and to my surprise she told me to be dressed and ready in my Maid 's Uniform and that she would pick me up to return to her home , and , as it would be dark , I could see no problem with that . She duly arrived and I tottered down my driveway as quickly as I could and settled into the front seat of the car as best I could , dressed in such a way . She ran her hand up over my stocking-clad thighs and gave my front suspenders a little tug , giving me a little smile whilst doing so , what could I do , wearing such a short dress , which did nothing to hide my stocking tops and frilly knickers , and so began the short trip to her home . Once inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained that she fell in love with me the first time she saw me dressed in my Maid 's Uniform , but had had her eye on me for some time as I admit I did on her , so the feeling was mutual . And that night , if I loved her , she wanted me to do something for her if I wanted to ; if not , then nothing would change - we could still be lovers . So there I was in someone elses house , dressed as a Maid with nothing else to wear , so I agreed to her wishes and was duly asked to serve drinks to her friends who were waiting very quietly in another room . I was introduced to them as " Bunny The Maid " and the rest is history . I have been " Bunny The Maid " for the last 25 years and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , and will never get tired of wearing my little Maid 's Uniforms and being .

From the beginning of all the test , he only saw me as a girl since , during school , he was gone when I got up to get ready for school , and I was already dressed as a girl when he got home at night . I guess that 's why he never seemed to slip up and call me David ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mother or Daddy would call me . I wished it would have always been like that , I guess . <p> Mother , just as the doctor had promised , was all business and kept after me all the time for my manners and chores , and reminded me at any slip up that I was a young lady and should act so . Even going to the bathroom was preceded by a reminder to sit ! I never forgot that anyway , but her constant reminders did have an affect on me , I think . A couple of times , Mother even insisted I accompany her to the mailbox , or just for a walk around the block . Then , toward the end of the second week , she took me shopping with herand somehow I managed to not be as afraid as I thought I might be . Life as a girl was be so full of lessons and hard work ! But I did love it all , even with the regimen I was under .

I sort of jumped , but Mom reminded me the doctor would be stopping by and asked me to please answer the door . I was still a little nervous , of course , but walked quietly to the door and looked through a side window to make sure it was the doctor . When I finally opened it , She stood there and just looked at me for a moment . " Hello " Mother had approached from behind me , and before I realized she was there spoke . " Well Cathyarent you going to invite our guest in ? " <p> She turned to Mother and said it was time discuss results for the test period . At Mothers suggestion , we all went into the kitchen .

" Its been almost a full three weeks full time now young lady , and several weeks of part time exposure before thatand what do you think about all of this ? Is it anything like you imagined ? Or are you disappointed now that you 've had some experience in housework , cleaning , and so forth ? " <p> I had been hardly disappointed . If anything , I got even more excited about getting up in the morning and tackling a new project like cleaning the drapes or vacuuming orwell , anything , even starting to learn to sew with Mom to fit some of my new dresses ! ! I told her I was very happy to have had the chance andwas a little sad it would be over soon .

I remember excusing myself , getting up and bringing the coffee to refill her and Mothers cup as.well as the proper thing to do as a hostess . " As I was pouring each of them more coffee , Mother broke the deafening silence . <p> " Doctor Samuelson , I do n't  think Cathy wants to come out and say anything because she thinks it would hurt her fathers or my feelingsor that we might think less of her somehow , so I 'll say it instead . What Ive seen during the entire time was quite amazing to me ! Shewell , she is different ! I meanShes been so very happy ! And believe me , I have n't been easy on her !

I wanted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman !

" <p> Dr. S. looked at me and studied my face a bit then asked me straight out . " Now forgive me for using your other name butDavidif I were to tell you that you might never be a boy again , what would you say ? " <p> I glanced at Mother , and then looked at the doctor .

" I told her no , not at all ! " Ive been looking forward to being out with Daddy for a long time . I would n't want to give that up . Do I have to ? " <p> She laughed and smiled . " No , young ladyyou do n't  have to give that up this time . In fact , I think , given what 's happening , its more important than ever you DO go now ! " <p> Mother asked to go up to my room and start getting ready to return tobeing a boy again . " I think for now , why do n't  you just leave all your clothes where they are ? You can go to the spare room closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hang your dress in the closet with your other dresses and rememberput things away properly , young ladyOK ? " <p> I stood up , asked to be excused and slowly turned and walked up to my room . I was actually torn between the excitement of getting to go on a weekend campout with my friends and Dad and the sadness of realizing I would n't be wearing those clothes any more . It had been wonderful , and I remember how lucky I felt I had been to have been able to try it . But at that moment I just regretted the idea of no longer beinga girl .

( Most often it 's best that they are just fantasies . ) Although I 've not experienced any truly horrifying moments , I have a few embarrasing ones to share with you gals . <p> You may have read my " first encounter " of earlier days when I used to try on my sister 's crinolines late at night while she was sleeping the same room . Daring , for sure , but never caught . One time during daylight hours , however , I was playing " lingerie inspector " , going thru the " dirty clothes hamper " and happened upon a lacy bra . ( I just love the way our bras give us a special little hug ! ) I was inspecting such a " no no " item when my sister walked in and caught me " lacy handed .

Of course , I died right there ! <p> One day in the 1950s when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru my father 's store , which sold clothing for the whole family and more , I was headed to our attached apartment . Perhaps you can imagine my embarrassment when one of the clerks asked if I would try on a petticoat ! It seems a classmate 's grandmother was doing some shopping and was n't sure of her size . I had walked in at just the right time and she felt I was close to Donna 's size . Being so secretive about my desire to do just that , wear petticoats , I declined the offer . No doubt I was very red-faced . Darn it , sure blew a great petticoat opportunity ! <p> Time marches on and , yikes , some 20 years later I have my own petticoats and usually enjoy shopping for them . Back then , often using the flimsy excuse of going to a costume party or for Halloween , I 'd bought many a petticoat . One such time I was quite startled when a clerk in a combination Thrift Shop-Square Dance shop asked with much sacrasm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much died that day and mumbled something about it was n't for me .

Now we 're at another square dance shop , and using another " costume party " excuse for buying a petticoat ( A long pink net petticoat this time that I am proudly wearing as I write this ) . The lovely lady asked in a very sincere way if I 'd like to try it on . Hey , why not ? ! Even though likely " red-faced " again , I stepped into the dressing room , took off my " male " clothes , and tried on my very first petticoat in front of someone else . Well , not exactly , but you know what I mean . <p> And here we are in the 90s .

" The gentleman 's eyes gleamed . " I like the rustle ! " <p> " I have on three , " a woman said proudly . <p> " Big petticoats make women look like lamps , " a man declared bluntly . <p> " Those petticoats , " a very smoothly garbed woman remarked , running her hand over her dress where it clung to her hip , " are wonderful for women who are too fat or too thin . " <p> If one wants to start a controversial conversation , introduce the subject of petticoats into any mixed gathering . There is , however , no disagreement among those who weave the goods , turn them into petticoats , and sell the garments . Two years ago petticoats made up only 12 percent of the undergarments sold in 7,000 department stores . This year petticoat sales account for half the lingerie sales . <p> How did this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came about because a large number of women in the U.S. who took up full skirts after World War II refused to follow the dictates of dear old fashion and return to the slim look . <p> That a great many females find a fitted waist and full skirt pleasing is not strange . This silhouette best displays the attributes of the female form as contrasted with the comparatively flat male figure . It has been standard practice for women of the Western world to point out these differences in their dress for centuries . <p> In the sixteenth century , when the first Queen Elizabeth came to power , the farthingale was imported to England from Spain . This was the original hoop skirt , and all " serious students of dress ' believe that women wore it to enhance their size and importance . Perhaps today the same thing is true of the modern crinoline , but this writer doubts it . She believes that happily , several years ago , a harassed manufacturer suddenly got the idea of putting a stiff petticoat under a scanty skirt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods . What with the avid assistance of the undergarment departments in promoting this invaluable ( to undergarment purveyors ) idea , and the fact that the ballet look was well established for the young , petticoats soared--and billowed . <p> Fashion experts may quarrel with this explanation of the current trend of petticoats . But the price of goods has more to do with the cut of clothes than fashion dictators care to admit . <p> To be sure , if American women had not felt like wearing petticoats , the brave attempt to save goods in dresses and improve the undergarment industry by promoting petticoats would have failed . The success of a fashion in the U.S.A. depends in the final analysis on whether enough women want it so it is economically desirable to manufacture it in large volume . <p> When it became apparent to buyers that a very large number of women wanted these adjuncts in their wardrobes , special goods were woven . Many undergarment manufacturers have now given up making anything but petticoats . These manufacturers are now in a cold sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prospects depend on why women go for them . Is it for a good sound reason in their own opinions , or is wearing petticoats just a whim ? <p> Petticoats in their current form , trice-ruffled or worn in triplicate , have been revived from a day when women did n't rush around in public conveyances and go out of their homes to do paid jobs . When women became " emancipated " they gave up wearing voluminous petticoats . This does not prove , however , that the American female , by taking to petticoats , is displaying any signs of renouncing the freedom her mother and grandmother made such a row about obtaining . On the contrary . The majority of petticoat wearers have a sound personal reason for wearing the garments . They assert , rightly , that petticoats create the illusion of a small waist . If the waist is already small , it becomes miniute . That bouffant petticoats make a female wide around the hips does n't concern her today if she chooses to wear them . Everyone in a bouffant petticoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To get the small-waisted look the girls tried cinching in their waist with corsets , but that was uncomfortable . Hips have been padded , but the result with a tight skirt is grotesque . the most sensible , comfortable and even most economical way to appear to have a small waist today is to stick out your skirt with petticoats . To be sure , a skirt properly cut with enough goods in it would create the same effect , but then one would have to pay more for each dress and one would have no choice as the whether or not it stuck out . <p> Petticoats exist now chiefly the disguise the figure . " You have to face the fact that you better never leave off your petticoated look or those who get used to you in it will suddenly receive a terrible shock , as if you 'd left off your lipstick , " says one wearer . the young ladies who park their crinoline petticoats in the ladies ' room during working hours must feel positively nude without them and the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow workers . <p> Innocent bystanders , as well as wearers , have to put up with a good deal from petticoats . It can be quite funny to watch a petticoated bus traveler as she sits attempting with one hand to hold down her crinoline so she can feel herself a lady , while with the other hand she is endeavoring to tuck up her petticoats so they wo n't sweep the floor . The remote , pleased look she puts on her face in an attempt to cover her nervous confusion may come to be known as having a Petticoat Face is this goes on long enough . <p> There are ladies who , when asked why they wear petticoats , say immediately and simply , " I wear petticoats because they work . " They laugh as they say it , leaving no questions on whom they find their petticoats work . <p> These ladies are the true descendents of those who in previous centuries were known as " Petticoats , " a term demoting the mysteriously attractive female sex . " Petticoats " made a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a bit of ankle , or , by the time the Flora Dora girls came along , a good bit of leg surrounded buy much frou-frou . <p> In our day such ladies as are worthy of being called True Petticoats realize that , whether it is part of the male racial consciousness or just that fathers have told their sons about it , what the men from 20 up who are sincerely pleased by petticoats really like about them is the sound they make : " like wind in the pines " -- " that starchy sound " -- " the rustle " -- " the whisper of petticoats . " never mind what a petticoat does to a girl 's figure , say male petticoat admirers . <p> In addition to the Practical Petticoaters and the true Petticoaters , there are the Fashionable Petticoaters . But the number of females who say they are wearing petticoats because petticoats are being worn is amazingly small . Most American women now feel free to decide whether what is decreed fashionable has any useful purpose for them before they take to it .

So I still have the pleasure of swishing in three to five stiffly starched petticoats when I want to , or the delightful bell-like sway of my hoop-supported skirt ballooning around me . However , wearing hoops one must be very careful about bending over , as the hoops lift up in the back and everyone can see my ruffled pantalets .

I purchased a new wardrobe of clothes , all top of the knee length , had a modern hair-do and enjoyed the new social world . Well I seemed to get things under control reasonably well and kept the lace show to no more than half an inch before having to hitch my slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to go and assist with taking the minutes and coffee serving at the senior manager 's meeting , which was being held in the main building at our branch . Needless to say , I made sure that my slips were not showing , and away I went . <p> " After a couple of hours of note-taking , I was asked to make and serve coffee . This involved having to reach across the tables to pour the coffee . I soon became aware of eyes looking at my lower half , and when I had finished serving , went to the back of the room - I could see in the window a good half inch of black lace showing below my hem at the back , with a little cream lace below that ( It is always black and cream when things slip badly ) . As I attempted to pull my slips up , I received a smile from one of the managers . <p> " At lunchtime he came to me and said that he thought my choice underwear was very nice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner with him at his hotel that evening , which I accepted . When I arrived home after work , I decided to wear a straight burgundy skirt with a white blouse from my new wardrobe . I had also purchased a couple of silky half slips , two inches shorter than previous , one in a dusky pink and the other in white ; I decided to wear the dusky pink one . Checking in the mirror before leaving home , just a slither of pink lace was showing , so I decided to leave it and tease . <p> " The meal went well , and as we left the table to sit in the lounge area for drinks , I noticed in the window my slip had slipped a little more ; he whispered to me that ' Charlie 's dead ' ( I hate that expression ) . When we sat down , I asked who Charlie was as I did n't know any one named Charlie ( This always embarrasses men when you reply like this ) . <p> " He then said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sexy , the pink lace below the burgundy skirt . ' We had our coffee and he never took his eyes off my legs and the pink lace peeping out as my skirt rode up , sitting in the deep arm chairs . He kept referring to my black and cream lace on show earlier in the day . ( Why does the sight of a slip on show drive a man wild ? ) When I decided it was time to go , he walked me to the door and said , ' Do n't forget your slip is showing a little more now . " So I put my hands in the top of my skirt and asked him to tell me when it was out of sight . He seemed quite flustered and embarrassed by this , gave me a peck on the cheek and thanked me for a nice day .

He is ten years younger than I but makes a good escort to take me out and keep me feeling young at forty .

So , come on girls get - them half slips on and let 's rule the men ; they will eat out of your hands .

@@37517983 @6517983/ <h> PUNISHED BY MOTHER 'S RULES <p> Judy Thomas was one of the finest behaved kids that you could ever hope to find anywhere ; she was courteous , kind hearted , and very obedient . You could say that she was a model child . She was just going on fifteen when her life began . <p> On the other hand , for Jody Thomas , Judy 's other self , during his whole life , there was only one thing that bothered him : No matter how hard he tried , there was just nothing he could do right for his widowed mother . He understood that she had gone through some very hard times after his father died , and that for some reason , she was taking it out on him , for something he had no part in the making . Her methods of punishment were something that were hard for Jody to understand or deal with , for whatever offense he was accused of doing or not doing , his mother would always punish him by making him dress up completely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white stockings , and patent leather little-girl style shoes . Then he would have to spend that time playing little girl games , or play with girls ' toys . It was his mother 's way of taking her revenge out on the men of the world , and showing how she felt about them . She was trying to destroy Jody 's chance of ever becoming a man by feminizing him as much as possible , and treating him much better when he was dressed up like a girl than as a boy . <p> Jody was only three when his father died , and from that time on , Mrs. Thomas kept him dressed up as a girl all the time . When he became seven , and it was time for him to attend school , she had to send him as a boy , but when he got home , the pants and shirt would come off and he would be put into pretty frilly dresses and made to play with his dolls . He was never allowed to play with the other kids from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , Jody really did n't know any better , and enjoyed being with his mother . <p> As Jody approached the age of ten or eleven , he began to question his mother about having to dress up as a girl . She would tell him that since he was such a bad boy all the time , it was her way of punishing him , without hitting him . But a few months after that his mother was almost forced to forget her idea of keeping him in dresses . His friends were starting to show up around the house , and Jody said he was going to tell the teacher at school what he had to do every time he got home . This made her a little nervous . So she let him become a boy , doing things with other boys . Every once in a while , Mrs. Thomas would catch him doing something , no matter how minor it might have been , and she would dress him up in a dress and make him stay in the house for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week for the next four or five years . <p> Jody was getting bigger , and learning more about what real life was about , and her chances to dress him up got fewer and fewer , until one day just after he turned fifteen , he stole something from a candy store and got caught . This was now Mrs. Thomas 's chance to really get him good . It had been several months since she had given him petticoat punishment , and the clothes she used then were now just too small . On the way to the store to pick her son up , she stopped at a girl 's dress shop and bought several dresses ; then she went to several other stores to buy underwear , stockings , shoes , and everything she was going to need to start her plan in motion . Then she went to the store to pick him up . Once in the store , she apologized to the owner , and paid for what he got caught taking , and promised that he would never ever steal anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck , and dragged him to her waiting car , opened the door and pushed him inside . <p> As they drove the short distance to the house , Jody saw the bags of things in the back seat and knew the labels all too well . His mother was telling him that this was the last straw , he was really going to pay for this stunt . He was going to be put back into dresses , and she did n't care who he told about it . In fact , she was going to call the school herself , and explain what had just happened , and make the proper arrangements , and get permission from the principal to register and send him to school as a girl for the rest of the school year , and maybe longer if necessary . <p> Jody did n't really think that she would go that far , but as soon as they got into the house , she sent Jody to his room , then picked up the phone and talked to the principal , explaining all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to punish him with petticoat training , and end the problems she was having with her son by sending him to school in dresses to shame him in to doing the right thing--before it was too late to help him . <p> The principal told her that since the problem was so severe that arrangements would be made , and he was sure that starting tomorrow he would be able to attend school registered as a girl . Mrs. Thomas called Jody out of his room and told him what arrangements had been made . Jody was horrified when his mother told him what was going to happen to him . He had only been shoplifting the things to get in with the guys , and he explained just how wrong and how sorry he was for doing it . <p> Mrs. Thomas was n't even listening to his pleas . She just gathered up her packages and bags and led Jody to his room . She got a clothes basket and emptied his drawers , closet , and laundry bag of all his boy 's clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out some of the frilliest and most feminine clothes Jody had ever seen and put them away into his drawers and hung the dresses up in his closet . <p> When she was finished putting his pretty new frilly wardrobe away , she turned to him and ordered him to strip completely naked . Jody turned to run for the door , but Mrs. Thomas grabbed him by the arm , and flung him across the room . Jody landed with a heavy thud against the far wall . Mrs. Thomas was still a very strong woman and Jody knew that she could really hurt him if she wanted to . <p> Jody got up slowly and began removing all his clothes . When he was naked , Mrs. Thomas took up the clothes and threw them in the hallway along with his other male things . His mother then went over to his drawer and took out a pair of pinklace-trimmed nylon panties , gave them to Jody , and told him to put them on . As he was doing that , she took out a matching colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave them to him . She did n't have to say a word . Jody just slipped the thing on like a real girl would , then placed the foam pads into the cups , which filled the small B cups very nicely . <p> Next came a pink garterbelt and a pair of beige , thigh-high seamless stockings . He slipped on the beribboned garter belt , then rolled the stockings up his legs and fastened the tops of them to the shiny silver slide hooks . A pink satin slip was then pulled over his head , and the thin shoulder straps were adjusted so that the slip hung on him properly , about mid-thigh . Next came a pair of black patent high-heeled pumps with three-inch heels . He slipped the glistening feminine shoes on to his feet , then tried to stand up . This was the very first time that he had ever worn shoes with heels that high and his balance was a little off . He almost fell over twice , but after taking a few minutes to get used to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally managed to walk in them well enough to finish getting dressed . He was getting better with each step as he got used to the unfamiliar height of them . <p> Once his mother saw that he could manage walking in black shiny high heels , she took the dress out from the closet that she wanted him to wear , and a stiff white ruffled petticoat . As she had him step into it , it rustled noisily as he pulled on the elastic waist band , trying to get it in place around his waist . Then she opened the zipper down the back of the pink taffeta dress and helped pull it over his head , and adjusted the skirt around the white heavily ruffled petticoat , then zipped the frilly little girl 's taffeta party dress up the back and tied the wide waist ties into a large bow at the small of his back . <p> Jody looked at himself in the mirror and could see how weird he looked . He was wearing high-heeled shoes , stockings , a petticoat that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worst of all it was a little-girl's-style taffeta party dress , with a white lace Peter Pan collar , and short white lace trimmed puffy sleeves . He turned to face his mother , and told her that he did n't mind her dressing him up like a girl , but this was just too embarrassing for even her to want him to wear . <p> She told him that as long as she was in charge , then things would be done her way , without question or he would be going to school in diapers . She took him to her room and sat him down in front of her makeup mirror , and began doing his make up and hair . She took his face in her hands and studied his features well , then took up the eyebrow tweezers and removed the unwanted hair on his brows , shaping them into a very feminine style ; then , with a brown eyebrow pencil , she darkened them in and shaped them the way she thought they should be . Next she applied several coats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eyeliner brush , she coated the edge of his lower lid with a single stroke . A blue eye shadow was put on his upper eyelids , then blended and toned to perfection . A streak of pink blusher was put on each of his cheeks , and blended with a tissue . Using a glossy hot pink lipstick , she shaped and filled in his soft lips , giving him a sweet pouty little-girl look . She stood back from him , just a little , and studied her creative work . She seemed to be happy with the effect she had created . Taking up her brush and curling iron , she styled his long over-the-shoulder-length , dirty blonde hair , teasing it and giving it body and style . When she was finally finished , she took a large pink velvet bow and fastened it to back of his beautifully styled hair . <p> She pulled him to his feet and turned him around so that he could see himself in the full length mirror on the wall . He was amazed at how well he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a young teenage girl . His legs looked great with his stockings and high heeled pumps , glistening in the room light . The short length of the skirt excited him , exposing even more of his stockinged legs , to at least mid-thigh . But the dress was that of a little girl , which was not to his liking . The stiff white petticoat rustled loudly if he made any movement at all . This made him more aware of the fact that he was now wearing a dress . It was like an irritating noise to his ears . <p> His mother looked at him , then told him that this is what he would wear to school tomorrow if he gave her any trouble whatsoever while he was being punished . This would also go for the entire time over the punishment period . She told him that she bought him a different style of clothes for him to wear to school , but just one remark or comment about what she was doing to him , and he would go to school dressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school year . Otherwise , as long as he cooperated , he was still going to school dressed as a girl , but as a young teenage girl , not a baby . <p> She told him that he was to stay dressed in that outfit for the rest of the day , and get used to his new high heels , for he was going to wear high heels every other day to school . He was also to act like a girl , and would do the things the other girls did , and do it with them . If he did n't want to have the guys find out that he was really a boy , then he had better be good at being a girl . He also had been switched from shop class to home economics class , where he was going to learn to make his own dresses , how to cook and clean , and how to take care of a house properly . She also told him that on the weekends when he did n't have any dates with boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of , and be his mother 's personal maid . <p> Starting as of this minute , and for the next few months , her son did not , and would not , exist ; he would now be known as Judy Thomas , Jody 's cousin who had come to help take care of Jody 's mother until Jody came back , from wherever he was sent away to , for stealing . <p> To earn extra money to pay for more pretty dresses , and extra finery , since he was going to be buying his own feminine clothing for him to wear from now on , he would , starting in a couple of days , work at several of the his mother 's friends ' homes , cleaning , tending to parties as a French Maid , and doing whatever they wanted done . But most important for him , he was to be a perfect young lady at all times , and that no one was to know that he was Jody and not Judy . She told him that anything that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a young lady . Jody was in tears . With the school behind his mother , there was nothing he could do but go along with whatever she said , and try to make the best of it . <p> His mother sat him back down at her vanity , and took his hands in hers and manicured his nails , coating them with a glossy hot pinknail polish that matched his lipstick , leaving him with perfectly shaped , long glossy nails and very feminine-looking hands . She retouched his make up on his face , where his tears smeared his mascara and eyeliner . Then took him by his soft feminine-looking hands and led him back into the living room , where she made him walk back and forth until he got his stride right and was walking the way a proper young lady should . <p> The unfamiliar height of the three-inch glistening black pumps was causing his feet to hurt a little , and he mentioned it to his mother . She told him that it was the price that we girls have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . After about ten minutes more of walking back and forth , his mother finally gave him a break and let him sit down next to her on the sofa , but not without proper instruction , telling him how a young lady wearing such a short skirt should do it , especially when she chooses to wear such a stiff petticoat under such a short dress , unless she really wanted the boys to see the pretty pink lace-trimmed panties that he was wearing . Then she asked him if he was that kind of a girl . He answered her , telling her , " No , Mother , I 'm not . I 'm not even a girl . " <p> Mrs. Thomas turned and looked hard at her son , and told him that from now on he WAS a girl , and that he was to call her ma'am or Aunt Alice and nothing else . <p> Jody just nodded his head , and said , " Yes , Aunt Alice . " He would try to remember . <p> At the dinner table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take , and told him that they were vitamins . He would be taking them three times a day until this ordeal was over . They had dinner , although Jody did n't eat much . Then he slipped on the white ruffled-edge pinafore and was made to clear the table , do the dishes , and sweep up the floor while his mother , sitting at the kitchen table , sipping on a cup of coffee , watched and directed his every move . <p> When Jody was finished , she told him how nice it was having her pretty young niece staying with her , and to find her so sweet and willing to help out with everything that had to be done around there . Jody was still wearing his high-heeled pumps , and his feet were in pain . All he wanted to do was to sit and rest a while . But his mother had other plans . Until bed time , she told him , he was going to learn how to dance like a girl . Then she put on some soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for over an hour she was teaching him how to dance the girl 's part in both slow and fast dances . By the time he finally got to his room , he was really tired . His mother had laid a pretty royal-blue nylon shortie nightgown set for him to wear to bed . He just looked at it with dismay , and slipped it on and climbed into his bed , and died until morning , with his mother banging on the door telling him to wake up and get ready for school . <p> He got up and went in to take a shower . By the time he was done and back in his room , his mother had already placed his clothes for school on the bed . She was calling for him to get dressed as fast as he could , and then to come into her room to have his hair and makeup done . Jody put on his white lace bra and panties , pulled the tan-colored pantyhose up his legs , and pulled the lace-trimmed satin slip over his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the puffy , quarter length , see-through sleeves , and slipped into it . He slipped his stockinged feet into the pair of patent leather , navy-blue skimmers with half-inch heels . Jody found them very comfortable and easy to walk in . His step was light and airy , and he liked the way they felt and looked on him . <p> He then headed to his mother 's room , where he had his makeup put on and his hair styled and blow-dried into almost the same style he had it in last night . She fastened the large white lace bow into his hair , and told him how sweet he looked on his first day of school as a girl . They went downstairs and had breakfast and he took his vitamins . <p> His mother gave him a shoulder bag to carry . She told him that everything he would need for the day was in there , money for lunch , an extra pair of pantyhose , and his new wallet with all his new identity papers--everything a proper young lady should carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair was a new royal-blue wool jacket with large gold buttons .

While they were on their way to the school , she told him that she thought it would be a good idea if he went and tried out for the cheerleaders . She was sure he would look really cute in one of those short-skirted sexy outfits , and she knew that it would really turn the boys on . He would have a list that would be endless of all the boys that wanted dates with a pretty young cheerleader like he would make . <p> Mrs. Thomas pulled up to the school and Jody got out . He could feel the coolness of the air run under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a dress now than he ever was . The clicking sound that his blue patent leather skimmers made as they hit the sidewalk sounded like thunder to him as he took each step closer to the double doors that led into the school . As he got closer , he could see the principal waiting for him , inside the hallway . He had a smile on his face , and Jody knew that he knew all about what had happened to him . As Jody entered the doors , the man spoke to him , and asked Jody to follow him to his office so that he could make sure that everything was going to go alright on Judy 's first day of school . The sound the heels of his skimmers made on the tile floors in the hallway seemed to be even louder to him than it was on the pavement coming in , but it was all in his mind .

He would have no trouble passing himself off as a young teenage girl . <p> He ran through some of the general rules , and cautioned him that should it be found out that he was a boy and not a girl , some terrible things could happen to him , particularly if the boys in the school found out about him . He was also told that there were several boys attending school here that were under the same arrangement as Jody had , so even though he would not find out who they were , he wanted to let Jody know that he was not alone in his peril . Jody was to have a girl stay with him for the first several days , until he got to know the routine of his new classes scheduled for him now that he was a girl . <p> As Jody left the principal 's office , there was a girl waiting for him . She had Judy 's papers and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Carol . She was also fifteen years old , and very pretty , with wavy shoulder-length auburn hair hanging down her back and to her left front shoulder . She was wearing a red turtleneck blouse under a checkered blazer , and a blue denim miniskirt . Her legs were shapely and encased in brown nylon stockings . On her feet were a pair of red leather low-heeled shoes with a thin strap that went across the tops of her feet that fastened to a small gold buckle at the side of the shoes . She was wearing makeup , and it was applied very well , and her glossy red pouty lips were the focal point of her whole face . Jody thought she looked like a dream , and if there was a way he could , he would have liked to get to know her better . Carol was very friendly , and very helpful as the day progressed , and by the time school was over , they had become great friends , and they were standing together , talking quietly , while Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mrs. Thomas pulled up shortly , and as soon as she saw that Judy was with another girl , she got out of her car , and was introduced to Carol . They made a little small talk for a couple of minutes , then Mrs. Thomas told Carol of the plans she had made for the night , and out of the blue , she invited Carol to spend the night , go shopping , and have dinner out with them . Carol told Mrs. Thomas that she would love to , but she would have to check with her parents to see if it would be alright with them . Jody 's mother told her to get in the car , and she would drive her to her house , and if it was alright for her to go , then she could get anything she would need for school the next day , or any of the other things she may need for the evening . <p> It was only a short drive to Carol 's , and she ran into her house and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit case . She put her case in the trunk , and they were soon on their way to Jody 's house , and she asked where to put her things . <p> As soon as that was settled , they all left to go shopping and were soon at the mall . In one of the dress shops , Jody went into one of the dressing rooms and tried on a few dresses , and bought three of them that he really liked . He bought more lingerie , several pairs of shoes , a couple of nightgowns , and one that Carol was just thrilled about . He bought a dozen pair of pantyhose , and another dozen pair of stockings , and several pair of leotards in different colors . Of course these were all bought under the supervision of his mother 's watchful eye and the approving nod of her head . This of course was to let Carol believe that Jody was making all her own choices . <p> They left the mall , stopped in at a small Italian restaurant , and enjoyed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jody and Carol sat next to each other in the small booth.They were close enough that their hips were touching and one could feel the heat from the other 's body . It was tough for Jody , because he had a real liking for this girl , and at one point as they were talking Carol shifted a little to face Jody better and her miniskirt lifted up and their thighs and legs touched each other 's , causing their stockings to brush against each other , from the thighs to the calves of their legs . <p> Jody felt his cock instantly go rock hard under his short skirt . He only hoped that it would go away before he had to stand up to leave . Several times Carol placed her hand on Jody 's stockinged thigh while they were talking , making matters only worse for him . By the time they were ready to leave for home , Jody luckily had managed to get his cock to go soft again . This friend of his really liked to touch when she talked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him if he kept getting hard-ons just thinking about her . <p> When they got home , it was time they all took their showers and got dressed up in their nightgowns getting ready to call it a night . Mrs. Thomas took hers first , and she told them both good night and to make sure that they did n't stay up too late watching the television or listening to the tapes . <p> In a few minutes they were alone together , and Jody and Carol went in to take their showers . Jody went in first , and as soon as he was back into his room , wearing nothing but a towel , he found Carol sitting on his bed waiting for him . Jody was unaware of her being in his room , nor did he expect to see her in there . Jody was in shock . He held the towel up to cover his body , but it was too late . Carol had seen his chest and noticed that her friend Judy did n't have any breasts . As he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high , and Carol saw what else he was trying to hide . It was now Carol 's turn to be shocked , but it only lasted a few seconds . She had heard a rumor that there were several boys attending her school dressed up as girls , but she never knew why , nor had she ever met one , to her knowledge . <p> Rather than be angry about this situation , she was more curious than anything , and as she sat up on the bed , her skirt rose up her thighs , exposing more of her stockinged legs to Jody 's hungry eyes . He just loved the way she looked in her red shoes and tan stockings and her short skirt . He finally tried to speak , but no words were coming out of his mouth , only a small squeak . <p> Carol motioned for him to sit next to her on the bed , and they could talk . But Jody told her that he would feel better if he put on some clothes first , and Carol jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him put something on , and she handed him his stockings and a garter belt . As soon as they were on , she knelt beside him and slipped his feet into a pair of black leather pumps with three-inch heels . Then she opened one of the bags that contained the new nightgowns he had bought that day , and handed him the two-piece yellow lace-trimmed peignoir set with yellow satin ribbons woven through the bodice . Once he had it on , he sat down on his bed . <p> Carol immediately turned her back to him and started taking off her clothes too , leaving on her bra , and she put on a garter belt , a pair of black stockings , and slipped on a pair of Jody 's red patent leather high-heeled pumps with three-inch heels . Then she took another nightgown from a bag and slipped on the red peignoir set with the black ruffled trim around the neck , hem , and cuffs of the long see-through sleeves . She opened her purse and took out her makeup and redid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipstick . She had Jody come over to the mirror and she put her makeup on him , again using her favorite , red glossy lipstick , after which she took him by his soft manicured hands and led him over to the bed and they sat down together . <p> Carol asked him what was this all about , and why he was going to school as a girl when he was a boy . Jody told her the whole story , and admitted that he was getting used to it , and that he even sometimes liked it very much , especially the way the soft silky clothes made him feel so great all the time , and how horny he got most of the time while wearing his stockings , slip and panties . Carol told him that when she first met him , there was just something about him that was different than with the other girls , she had met there at the school . She told him that at the restaurant tonight , when she touched his leg against hers , she felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two of them , but she had no idea that he was a boy , and for that she is grateful , because she did n't want to become a lesbian . Now that she knew that he was really a boy , she felt so much better about having sex with him , but it had to be a while . <p> Jody was dressed up like a girl , looking so sexy and desirable . With that she placed her hand on his stockinged thigh and slowly rubbed it back and forth , in a heartbeat , his cock sprang up to a rock-hard condition , they could see the hem of his yellow lace-trimmed nightgow rise up as his cock grew harder , then begin to throb , in a rhythmic sort of way . Jody 's breathing was getting labored , and as she looked into his eyes , she could tell that this boy was in a real hurt for some real sex . Carol 's hand moved off his thigh and gently grabbed hold of his throbbing rock-hard cock , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft of his cock , dragging her hand slowly up the length of his cock . Jody had never felt anything like that in his entire life , it felt so good to him that he lost his breath for a moment , then let out a gentle moan of pleasure . With her other hand , Carol pulled one of the ribbon ends that kept the top of her pink nightie together and as she did , it fell open revealing to Jody a pair of fine-looking firm young breasts with hard nipples and a pink rosette . One look at these lovely young breasts and Jody leaned forward and opened his glossy red lips enough to hold one of her erec tyoung nipples , and gently sucked on it , and licked it with his hotpink tongue . As he did this , his hand shot out and took hold of her firm globe and gently squeezed and massaged it , while his lips and tongue devoured her nipple . Carol was already excited , but when her breasts were getting massaged , it only made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager mouth , and withdrew her own hands from his cock , then sat up straight on the bed and worked her ass off the bed and stood up . She looked down at Jody , still sitting on the bed , then pushed him back on his back . She took hold of one of his legs and as she knelt down on the carpeted floor , she started to lick the top of his stockinged foot and ankle , as her tongue licked and worked its way slowly up his leg , her hands gentle massaged his leg , sending little electric shock waves of excitement through his entire body . Jody had never felt this horny in all his life , he felt like he was just one single nerve ending , that was ready to explode . The closer Carol got to his cock , the more uncontrollable he became , just as he thought she was going to reach him there , she moved away and grabbed the other leg , and went through the same routine with it . Jody felt like screaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached his balls , she only kissed the head of his cock with her glossy red lips , leaving a bright glossy red ring on the tip of it . Jody reached for her , but she only pulled away , and she forced him to get on the floor where she was , and she took his place on the bed . She told Jody to do to her what she had just done to him . Jody grabbed one of her ankles and before he knew what happened , he had her squirming all over the bed , as he reached her pussy , he switched to her other leg , and when he reached her hot moist pussy this time he stuck his tongue into it and started to lick and suck the warm juices from it . Carol was almost going insane , but as she felt her load building up and before she shot her cookies , she made him stop . Carol pulled him up on the bed with her , and she climbed on top of his hips , grabbing hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pussy and then in one thrust she rammed her body down and her pussy engulfed his entire cock in one swift motion . Carol lifted and lowered her body on to his in a slow even place , she knew that it would not take long for either one of them to blow their rocks , and she wanted it to last as long as possible . As the emotions began building in Carol she could no longer control her moves , and she started to move faster and faster , until finally she blew her load . Jody 's load followed a heartbeat later , and as she sat on top of Jody resting , Jody could feel their love juices running down between his legs , to the crack of his ass , finally to drip on the bed , making a small puddle on the sheets . Carol rolled off of Jody and laid next to him , and they embraced each other tenderly , and began kissing , gently at first , then with passion . They held each other tightly , and after awhile they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . <p> The next morning , Jody got dressed in a yellow minidress with white lace trim at the pointed collar and the cuffs of the short puffy sleeves , his white leather high-heeled pumps with a two-inch heel , and a large white lace bow in his beautiful hair . He did make a lovely girl . Carol was dressed in a maroon minidress with black trim at the waist and collar , and a pair of black patentleather high-heeled pumps with two-inch heels . This was also the first time she had ever worn a large bow in her hair . It was made of black satin and really accented the dress she was wearing . <p> Mrs. Thomas smiled as she watch the two girls together . They were both very beautiful , and if things worked out the way she had planned , Judy would never want to be Jody again . Of course , if he did , there was always something that she could come up with so that she would be able to put him back in dresses , as he would always be punished by Mother 's Rules .

She was wearing a stunning new outfit : a then-current fashion white halter top dress , white hosiery and white 3 inch high heels . She had foot surgery just three months before and no one expected her to be able to wear high heels again . Her make up was very nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were very red .

As she pressed herself against me , I noticed that she was not wearing a bra . Being a 34A , she really did not need to wear one but I had never known my wife to go in public braless unless she was wearing a bathing suit .

As I walked , with my pal Ian , past them along the beach , I looked up and saw that Mrs McTaggart , who was wearing a baggy grey tweed skirt suit and had a scarf on her head was sitting with Miss Watson who , being younger , was a bit more fashionably dressed in a button through green coloured spotted dress and dark green jacket . Mrs McTaggart , who was eating a sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see most of her stockings and I thought even her knickers . I could n't make out much but I nudged Ian and whispered " Look to your left as we walk back " . We turned around after a few paces and looked again as we went by . This time I kneeled down to pick up something I had pretended to spot and was able to make out that her panties were a pale blue colour and seemed to cover her stocking tops . <p> As I picked up some bits of seashells , Ian said " Alex , I saw them and I know where they put out the washing to dry , do you want to see sometime ? " <p> What a stupid question that was ! Did I ever . As I looked again , she caught my eye and some flicker of understanding passed between us , or so I imagined , and I thought I saw her legs open a bit more . <p> Ian and I walked on a bit further , then we turned and walked back , but , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her tweed skirt . <p> * * * * * <p> The next day was pouring wet , so no beach , but the following day we went on a short bus outing to the nearby town . After a wander round the busy seaside towns main street , Ian and I went up a side street and spotted Miss Watson coming out of a shop a wee bit further up . We walked on nearer to the shop and saw in the window what we took to be corsets and bras . Feeling very bold , we looked in the door and there , amongst the lacy lingerie , was Mrs McTaggart , with a pair of long silky knickers held in front of her . She must have caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and started to turn our way , so we ducked back out of sight and Ian said " Wow , that was close , I do n't  think she spotted us " . <p> I replied , " I 'm not so sure , Ian . " <p> Later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus , I saw Miss Watson sitting in the front seat by the door and so I pretended to miss-step as I got on and fell up the steps so my eyes were level with her knees ; she had on a looser dress that day and I could see the ends of lots of white net petticoats and , further , up a glimpse of lace underneath . <p> She said , " Alex do n't  sit there staring into space all day , get into your seat . " I do n't  think she knew what I was looking at , but now I wonder . Mrs McTaggart had come up behind me by this time and , as I was bending to get up , she put her hand on my bum and said , " Come along Alex , we have all seen enough scenery for one day . " I was pretty sure then that she had a very good idea of what we had been up to at the shop and what I was doing on the bus . Her hand seemed to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave me a little push up the steps . <p> * * * * * <p> The following Thursday morning we were all to go on a walk through the woods and up into the hills nearby , but at breakfast disaster struck , or so I thought at the time . Miss Watson was hurrying past , and Ian nudged me and said , " Alex , look , look , you can almost see through her blouse " . Unfortunately I was drinking my orange juice at the time and proceeded to spill most of it on my trousers ; I was pretty wet and sticky . Not only that , but I had missed the anticipated view of her bra ! <p> Mrs McTaggart came over and took my arm saying " Come with me Alex , let 's get you cleaned up , we have n't got long before we have to go . " <p> " But Miss , " I said " I have no clean underpants " . " Never mind " she replied " I 'll find you something , we cant have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we were off up the stairs , with me trailing along behind . Naturally I looked up as I went behind her and could see her stocking clad legs and a bit of lace through the split in the back of her skirt but , alas , it was quite long and a more exciting view was not possible . We went into her room , where she rummaged in a drawer and said , " Do you have another pair of short trousers ? " <p> " Yes , of course Miss , " I replied trying to be bold and grown up . <p> " Go and get them , " she ordered , so off I went . <p> When I got back , she said , " Here , put these on , and hurry " . She handed me a dark blue coloured garment . I was horrified ; they looked like a pair of my sister 's elasticised school knickers ! <p> " Well , what are you waiting for , young man ? " she asked , " You either wear these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Are , are , these yours ? " I stuttered and at that moment a rather exciting thought went through my head . <p> " No , of course not , " she said " they belong to one of the girls - now take off those wet things and get a move on . " I turned to go , and she exclaimed " Where are you going ? " <p> " To change , Miss " I replied . <p> " Never mind that , " she said , " just take off those wet things now . " <p> I was about to protest , but I saw a certain look in her eye as she licked her lips with her tongue . <p> " Let me help , " she said . " We do n't  want you getting too sticky now , do we ? " and she started to undo my belt . The belt undone , she put her hand out again and started on the trouser buttons . I blushed as my trousers fell round my ankles and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Pull down those wet underpants and step out of them and I will get you dried off " . <p> Meekly , but secretly pleased , I replied in a whisper , " Yes , Miss . " As I reluctantly pulled down my wet white cotton underpants , I felt member grow and catch on the Y of the front , and I made to free it . <p> But she beat me to it and her hand slipped inside . I could feel it cool against my privates , my member gave another little jump , and I looked at her again and saw she had her eyes closed . She made no move to take her hand away , and I did n't  do anything to discourage her as I started to enjoy the feeling of her hand caressing me . <p> After a few moments , she slowly opened her eyes , withdrew her hand and said " Well , that 's enough for now , do n't  you think Alex ? We 'd better hurry . " <p> I could see she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wet underpants . She handed me the knickers and I put them on , pulling them up over my semi-hard member . <p> " Very nice fit , " she whispered , and her hand came forward and ran along the inside of the elasticised knicker leg . I could feel the elastic tight round my legs , which was most peculiar , but rather nice all the same . She took her hand away and was all business now , as I put on the clean trousers and , still buttoning those up , hurried down the stairs . <p> Once on the bus , I got a chance to tell Ian what had happened . <p> " Wow ! " he said " did she really touch you down there ? " <p> Then I told him about the blue knickers she made me put on . Of course he wanted to see them so I loosened the fly and trouser button and showed him the knickers . His hand came out and he looked at me . " Go on , " I said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand came forward and rubbed against the panties , then it moved down a bit and brushed against my member . I looked up and saw him blush and then slowly take his hand away . <p> " Very nice , " he said , blushing again . I looked down to the front of the bus and was horrified to see Mrs McTaggart looking at us . I quickly buttoned myself up again and pretended to looked out the window . <p> * * * * * <p> Later on when we stopped for a break in our hill climb , I noticed both teachers whispering together . <p> I do n't  know what she said to Miss Watson , but they both looked over at Ian and me . Miss Watson came over and , as she had her jacket open , we could see the outline of her bra through her blouse , I could even make out the outline of her nipples pointing at us . I lowered my eyes and saw she had on stout walking boots and a pair of grey cord trousers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , of course , very aware of the tight elastic of my knickers and could feel something else happening underneath them . <p> She looked down at me and said , " So , Alex , are you enjoying yourself ? " <p> " Yes Miss , " I replied boldly , " there is a fine view of the valley from here . " <p> She laughed , " Well then , young man , make the best of it , as we are starting back soon " . <p> I expected her to turn away , and I could see Ian looking over at us , but she moved slightly and spread her legs a bit wider ; then she winked and turned her head away . Now I could see the outline of her panties over her bum through the trouser material . <p> She gave a little wiggle and then shouted , " Come on , boys and girls , time to be getting back and changed for tea . " <p> As everyone turned away and set of down the hill again , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are you managing alright with the knickers Mrs McTaggart got for you , not getting to tight are they ? " <p> " No Miss , they feel very comfortable , " I replied . " I have got used to the elastic , I quite like the feel of the soft material against my legs . " <p> " Very well , " she said " come here and I will just check for you " . <p> I stepped closer and her hands came out and started to undo my trouser buttons , I jumped a little as I was taken by surprise by her actions . " Come along " she said " do n't  be shy , Alex " . I felt a thrill run through me as my trousers slid down my legs . <p> Her finger slipped inside the knicker elastic round my legs . I looked up to see her smiling at me . " That 's fine is n't it ? " she said " so come a little closer , young man " . <p> I moved forward and felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member ; I could feel it start to grow under her caress , but she did n't  stop just smiled again and gripped me tighter . <p> " Mmm , " she whispered , " you are growing up are n't  you Alex " . Her other hand started to pull my blue school knickers aside as she said , " We do n't  want you spoiling another pair of panties now do we ? " <p> I could feel my member start to peep out of the knicker leg as she bent over me . I closed my eyes and then I felt something warm , soft and wet move over my rigid member . I felt a hand hold my testicles , and just before I erupted into her mouth , she pulled away , tucking me back into the knickers . <p> She gave me a hug and said , " hurry now , Alex , " as her hand went round and felt my bum , " Pull up you trousers " . But it was to late , I was now very wet and sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be checking you put on clean panties when we get back " . <p> I hastily pulled up my trousers and set off behind her down the hill after the others .
