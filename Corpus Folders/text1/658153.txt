@@119554956 @8554956/ <h> Airbox ABX Vector Charts <h> What is ABX Vector Mapping ? <p> Airbox Foresight and and Clarity GPS 's are supplied with digital reproductions of the aviation charts such as CAA Charts in the UK . Some pilots prefer these because they are an exact copy of the paper charts they carry alongside them in the cockpit . These aviation charts on Airbox GPS units are accompanied by ABX Vector mapping . Airbox believe this is the future of flight planning and execution whereby GPS devices can access , not only the regulation air charts required to safely navigate the skies but also intelligent charting showing greater levels of detail and information not seen before in aviation . <p> Street Level Mapping using ABX Vector ( at extra cost ) <p> The local Aviation Charts and ABX Mapping work hand in hand to produce an incredibly powerful aviation tool that offers pilots visual information dependent on their circumstances and varying workloads ; whether you are planning a flight from home or in the cockpit or approaching a destination airfield . Raster Image-based charts such as the 1:500 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a user zooms out to view a larger area , the resulting screen image can become a little cluttered with information . ABX Vector charts take over at this point , displaying a fully scaleable , highly detailed chart that declutters as the user zooms out . ABX Vector can be used to zoom into a location revealing levels of detail that simply does n't show up on a regular aviation chart . <h> What other benefits does ABX Vector have ? <p> ABX Vector mapping with London Heliroute chart overlay <p> When using ABX Vector mapping the panning and zooming of charts is fast and seamless but when you fly off the edge of your aviation chart , your Airbox GPS device will now automatically switch to the next best chart available . For example in the UK a standard 1:500,000 ICAO chart will switch to ABX vector mapping when you fly over France . The ABX Vector mapping for Europe reaches as far as southern Italy , Corsica , Northern Africa , France , Germany , Spain , Portugal , Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Switzerland etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database covering some 28,000 individual airfields which is updated for free every 28 days of the AIRAC cycle . <p> ABX Vector with enhanced topographic terrain <p> ABX Vector charts also comes with some of the most detailed topographic data available today . Originating from data collected by NASA 's Shuttle Radar Topographic Missions , the added dimension gives pilot 's access to visual data that simply does n't feature on any aviation chart . <p> Airspace is shown clearly overlaid on the ABX Vector charts <p> For pilots who are more comfortable planning and flying with the aviation charts there is no need to worry ; the Airbox software will never force you to use this alternative ABX mapping . Simply select the chart type you want to display on your device and let Airbox do the rest . 211256 @qwx1071256 211260 @qwx1071260 211259 @qwx1071259 211257 @qwx1071257 211261 @qwx1071261
