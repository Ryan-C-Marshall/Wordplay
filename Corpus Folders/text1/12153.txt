Part of this comes from living well apart from my mother 's cooking , and part of this comes from wanting to learn more practical skills . The knitting fits into this pattern , of realigning some part of myself to my family 's lineage of ability . But I was , and to some extent still am , wary of perpetuating this idea of domestic-coded tasks as female , or femme , or worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me needles so I could make him sweaters and scarves ; I 'm not learning new cooking skills to set up elaborate feasts for my breadwinning man . The arguments are , of course , only in my head . But how could they not be there , when it was only my grandmother 's work that hung in my family 's closets , hugged us on cold days and draped over us on warm ones ? When it was my mother who mended the rips and stains of my clothes ? When the popular image of knitters is still of old women doting on the begrudging members of their families ; yes , Grandma , thanks for yet another pair of socks . <p> It 's not fair to chalk my reticence all up to that . There was also this : How would I ever be able to match my grandmother 's tacit standard ? I know I had n't met it before , and the fear of the learning curve is additionally real when it 's touched with love , with loss . It could be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I had n't given up as a child , become frustrated in the face of her expertise , I would n't have to think about these questions now , a world away from her save for the memorials she made to be worn . And so , I decided to learn . <p> I started knitting only a couple of months ago . I 'm in the middle of making a scarf , I think , which is great timing as Los Angeles barrels toward summer . Oh well ; it 's the process I 'm after , and that itself is relaxing . The needles are bamboo so they do n't really clack , but I find myself muttering my knits and purls under my breath , leaning into this unsteady rhythm . It is what I owe her , to really learn in earnest this time around . I do n't know if I 'll ever be able to replicate her designs , or ever match her skill . But I 'm okay with that , as long as I push myself to keep picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll take a while before I can even start to think about designing a sweater , so there 's much to practice . I only have so much time in the world . <p> Has a loved one ever inspired you to learn a new skill ? Tag us on the goods @BritandCo !

There are times when the saying " absence makes the heart grow fonder " really rings true .

But its also important to know when you should turn down an invitation to spend some quiet time together .

So make sure you say it often , but make sure you 're not saying it absentmindedly . <p> 6 . You understand what " unconditional " means . Every relationship has its ups and downs , but knowing how to look past those hard times is what will take you into the big leagues .

Follow our Hit Refresh series through January for new ideas , hacks and skills that will help you achieve ( and maintain ! ) those New Year 's resolutions . <p> You 've resolved to clear out the junk and clean up your life " or at least your home . Whether it 's an old refrigerator or prescription medicine , there are probably items cluttering your space- just because you do n't know how to get rid of them properly. - Cleaning up your home- and yard can be easy , especially if you have neighborhood cleanup programs that help you dispose of larger items you ca n't throw away. - To get your home back in order , we 've put together this list which outlines how to dispose of or recycle these 10 common household items you just do n't know what to do with . Scroll on for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Medicine : We used to be encouraged to flush unwanted pills down the toilet , but now we know that 's not so great for the environment , and- tossing unneeded or expired prescriptions in the garbage can be dangerous. - Try to- de-clutter- your medicine cabinet regularly , and drop prescriptions off at a pharmaceutical take-back event , which are typically hosted by local law enforcement agencies or hospitals . <p> 2 . Appliances : From toasters to washing machines , appliances that are in good working condition can be- donated to a church or a childcare center , and could qualify for a tax write-off . If the appliance does n't work , consider recycling it through a certified e-waste recycler , or see if the EPA 's Energy Star Program offers a rebate for recycling the item . <p> 3 . Books and Magazines : Instead of tossing unwanted books and magazines into the recycling bin ( or worse " the trash pile ) , consider donating them to your local library . Another option is to donate them to a private organization that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gently used children 's books , contact the schools in your area and ask if they accept donations . <p> 4 . Compact Florescent Lamp ( CFL ) bulbs : The beauty of CFL bulbs is that they last for *years* " but it 's worth knowing that they contain a small amount of mercury , which means- they 're considered hazardous waste . When they do burn out , they ca n't be thrown in your curbside trash or recycling bins , but there 's a good chance they can be disposed of at your local hazardous waste facility or through your recycling service provider . Alternatively , many Lowe 's stores accept CFLs for recycling . <p> 5 . Power Cords : Do you have a drawer full of power cords and chargers you have n't needed in years ? Use online sites to locate a nearby recycling center or e-waste collector that accepts these items instead of throwing them out .

Hazardous Household Waste ( HHW ) : Chemicals like paint , pesticides and cleaners contain potentially hazardous ingredients , so you should n't pour them down the drain , in the gutter or put them in a trashcan . Instead , contact your local government and ask if there 's a nearby HHW collection site or if the city designates a day when citizens can drop off HHW at a specified location . <p> 8 .

Computer Ink and Toner Cartridges : Major business supply stores like Staples will recycle your ink and toner cartridges for you , and then provide a discount off the purchase of new ink and toner .

With all the DIY skincare , the all-natural beauty movement bringing on a slew of new products and even higher-end , majorly active products that work within hours of applying , there really is something for everyone . I could- list every way I 've seen people all over Pinterest- try to get rid of blemishes , or- I could give you the real scoop. - These- wonderfully weird + wacky methods- have my seal of approval . After using them once or a dozen times to zap my zits ; ) <h> The Best Blemish Busters <p> Take a look at a few of- my favorite blemish busters- " - mind you there are endless products and home remedies ( I sense a DIY Acne treatment post coming your way ; ) . Here- are five of the best from my own personal experience keeping my skin clear : <p> 1 . Best All-Natural Spot- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is the end-all-be-all when it comes to zit zapping ! This formula packs a punch ; I 've honestly never used- another product that works as fast or effectively as this little bottle of kick-ass ! ! I will say that it 's no joke , and you really want to apply it to your blemish only . It 's a zap of an intense , fast-acting formula that you can feel working right away . My blemish is noticeably better within a few hours of applying . <p> 2 . Best All-Natural Secret = Tea Tree Oil : If my skin is feeling more sensitive , I grab my long-time skin-clearer tea tree oil . I actually apply a layer of this oil all over my face once a week for maintenance , but it also works great as a spot treatment . Tea tree oil is known to disinfect and purify your skin , which helps prevent acne and , in my case , helps those hormonal punk pimples go away faster than they would with- anything else . Find- an oil that is 100% pure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Best Toiletry That Doubles as a Zit Zapper = Toothpaste : I 've tried a *lot* of different toothpastes and- use an all-natural toothpaste , but for- getting rid of pimples , the type of toothpaste you use as a spot treatment actually does matter . Gel toothpastes do n't seem to work for my blemishes ; it 's all about that creamy hardcore stuff like Sensodyne ProNamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste ( $2 ) . Apply a dot over your blemish and sleep on it . By the morning you should see a milder version of the trouble spot . This is a great on-the-go spot treatment while traveling ! <p> 4 . Best Blemish Buster You Can Find in Your Pantry = Tomato : For those of you in a pickle without any of the above , you can always open up your fridge and reach for- a tomato . The acidic juice from the tomato is packed with vitamin C and antioxidants , which will help minimize pores and speed up the drying out of your blemish . Apply the pulpy part of the tomato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and leave on for 10-15 minutes for preventative measures . <p> 5 . EASIEST Pimple Treatment Ever = Ice : Weird right ? ! ? ! But think about it , what do you do when you have swelling on any other part of your body ? You put ice on it . For those moments when I need fast action on those hormonal blemishes that are deep in my skin , I simply wrap ice in a thin cloth and hold it on my blemish for a minute . If I need to repeat this step again , I wait a few minutes in between so my skin does n't get irritated . This reduces swelling , the pain and the longevity of the little suckers ! <p> It 's important to note that the cause of pimples or acne really is different from person to person and you 'll want to consult a dermatologist or naturopath if you 're really feeling defeated by your blemishes .

However , liquid eyeliners last between six to 12 months or until the formula dries out or starts clumping up . <p> Lipstick If you 're stocking up on your favorite shade ( we 've been there , done that ! ) , it can last up to three years if unopened immediately . Once opened , its time to toss if it starts to smell or taste funny and strong . <p> Lip Gloss Glosses do n't  last as long as lipstick formulas and have a shelf life between six to 12 months , depending how clean you keep the applicator .

( One woman in Australia even reported getting a staph infectionwhich left her in a wheelchairfrom makeup brushes with a gal pal .

I 'll be the first to admit that finding my workout motivation- was n't the most fun thing in the world " - fighting through Bikram yoga classes as a newbie and attempting to run without a training plan while seriously out of shape got me really down . I was also pretty miserable during a period when I exercised too much after finally finding my fighting form . Constantly working to strike the right balance for my bod , I recently cut back from six workouts a week to three . Here 's how it went . <h> Week 1 : I 'm Less Hungry <p> I 've been super busy juggling project work , freelance writing and teaching class these days , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding extra time . Despite the awesomeness of having extra hours , I do feel a little afraid of losing some of my hard-earned strength and the good energy flow &amp; mental clarity that comes with exercising every day . I 'll admit that I 'm also a bit nervous about continuing to fit into my clothes " I do n't exercise to lose weight , but I 'm fully aware that the extra movement helps balance some of my fave indulgences , like a seasonal treat from SusieCakes or a wine night with the girls . My week typically combines 4-5 barre classes with an active weekend activity ( a hike , bike ride or stand-up paddleboard session ) . I live in San Francisco , so I also sneak in lots of steps and long walks with hills . I usually trek about two and a half miles each day , which adds up to 15 miles per week . <p> The first thing I notice during my week of cutting back on workouts- is that I 'm way less hungry . This might be predictable , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it still catches me by surprise . It could be coincidence or timing , but I seem to have less of a sweet tooth too . While catching up on some reading , I learn that exercise can actually increase junk food and dessert cravings as your body tries to replace the calories it 's lost . Well gee , I guess that 's why post-class cake stops are so hard to resist ! <h> Week 2 : I 'm Working Harder <p> Sticking to two barre classes per week , my regular walking around the city and my fun weekend activity , I 've noticed another new benefit : I 'm working much harder in class than I have in a reallllly long time . <p> When I stop to think about it , this actually makes total sense to me . Because I teach class and was taking so many , from time to time I DO feel burnt out on the class structure , choreography patterns and studio rooms . Though I 'm still teaching my usual amount , my second week of fewer classes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a student . It feels fresh and fun again ! <p> Even more , because I know I 'll only be in class a couple of times , I 'm working much harder . This means taking all of the challenge options I possibly can and pushing my boundaries more than before . When I was taking classes five or six times a week , it was hard to see my progress or push self-set limits because I was constantly sore . Now , I feel stronger . <h> Week 3 : I 'm Finding Focus and Balance <p> It 's the third week of my experiment , and I 'm still feeling really good . My energy levels are stable , I 'm sleeping better ( less soreness ! ) , and I 'm totally enjoying my remaining weekly workouts . Since I work from home , I 've also found that my productivity has improved when I don't- have to stop at a particular time to hit up a class . <p> While I 'm finding focus , I also need to remember how important it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunker down to power through a long creative spurt or work into late-night hours is definitely a welcome change , my workouts did force me out of the house . Without them , I 'm missing that break and social time " something that 's really important for anyone who works alone . <h> Week 4 : I 'm Tuning In and Making Tweaks <p> Though I was worried about losing my strength or shape with half the workouts , my clothes fit fine . Actually , they 're a little bit loose . I think this probably comes from some muscle loss ( especially in the rear lifted seats from barre classes are a legit thing ! ) and eating less . Without super-hunger and major cravings , I 'm pretty content with simple foods that fill me up and help me power through my project work . <p> A- month-long test can definitely differ from long-term results , but I feel totally confident about sticking with my new schedule and *not* freaking out if I ca n't squeeze in a workout as often as I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also feel super open to making changes as my schedule and life evolve " trying different exercises , switching up the number of dedicated classes I take during the week , tweaking my diet or sleep schedule " to stick with the path to find balance and success . <p> What workout schedule makes you feel the best ?

My boyfriend and I are n't in each other 's profile pictures or listed in as being in a relationship on Facebook . When we 're in public , we might hold hands or give each other a peck on the lips if we 're feeling really wild , but we keep the PDA to a minimum . Even though we save all the lovey-dovey stuff for when we 're in a more private environment , we still get plenty of side-eye just for acting happy together in public .

Whether it 's their own jealousy coming into play or just the fact that they kind of hate the way people 's faces look when they smile , they seem to find any way possible to make couples feel bad about enjoying spending time around each other . But quite frankly , I 'm all a bit tired of the negativity . If you say any of these things to a happy pair , do n't be surprised when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <h> 1 . " Just wait until you get past the honeymoon stage . " <p> People who say this seem to think that- every stage of a relationship is the " honeymoon stage . " You 've only been dating a month ?

Just celebrated your 60-year anniversary ? Hope you 're prepared for what happens after you 've both been dead for twenty years and you see who they- truly are on the inside . If two people are happy , let them be happy . They 'll figure out the tougher stuff when they get to it . <h> 2 . " My ex and I were- just like you two until everything went to hell .

" Do n't you two ever get sick of each other ? " <p> Of course we do . But even after a long day of assembling IKEA furniture together , the fact remains that we can tolerate each other better than we can tolerate most people after such a taxing endeavor . Everyone needs a break from other people after some length of time , but people in happy relationships only need a couple of hours away from each other as opposed to a couple of months . <h> 4. *Gagging noise* <p> I know , I know , I- kissed my partner on the cheek and caused you to exceed your recommended daily dose of PDA , but unless you 're actually going to vomit , spare me .

" <p> Consistent sexual chemistry , successful communication about likes and dislikes , - and knowing they 're not just going to peace out after we finish ? Ugh , please , anything but that . Sexual compatibility is necessary for any good relationship , so if the couple in question seems to be a-ok with staying together for a very long time , they 're probably not too concerned about enjoying the same set of genitals for the rest of their lives . <h> 6 .

If your friend has genuinely changed since they got into a relationship , it 's totally fine to talk to them about it .

@@13608597 @2208597/ <p> Falling in love is such a big deal that entire movies , books , and Disney characters are constructed around the very idea of it . But what are the signs you 're falling in love IRL ? It 's an exciting ( and slightly terrifying ) sensation , and although it sometimes seems to happen at first sight , it usually takes a while before we feel the real thing for someone we 're dating. - Sure , we might feel infatuated with our new flame , but more often than not , a relationship has to become a bit more serious before any feelings of- true love start to creep in . But how can you tell the difference between falling deeply in like and falling in love ? <p> It 's safe to say most of us know how it feels when we really , really start to enjoy someone 's company . We get all the physiological symptoms , such as the classic sensation of having butterflies in our stomachs , and of course , there 's that **33;128;TOOLONG feeling of always having them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something else . However , even if we 're completely prepared for our emotions to take the next step , we do n't always realize that what we 're feeling for that special someone is " love " with a capital " L. " And sometimes , it 's because the signs of falling in love are n't what we 'd expect . <p> Whether you 're just letting it happen or actively trying to make a connection ( and if you are , these 36 questions can really help you out ) , check out these strange signs that you might be falling hard for your beau . They might not be what you 're likely to see in the next romance novel you read , but they definitely indicate that what you two have going might be the beginning of your own fairy tale . <h> 1 .

Your Heart Rates Synchronize <p> Why did we never learn about- this in high school biology ? Researchers at UC Davis had 32 couples sit across from each other and stare into each other 's eyes while their heart rates were measured . Interestingly , the couples ' heart rates seemed to attempt to synchronize with each other . However , the same could not be said when the same experiment was performed using people who were- not in romantic relationships with each other . So if you 're curious as to whether or not your love is the real deal , hook yourselves up to some machines and see what science says . <h> 3 . Stuff That Normally Grosses You Out Is No Big Deal <p> A study from the University of Groningen has already suggested that we 're less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually aroused , so it should come as no surprise that many of us are actually- willing to put ourselves in gross situations when we 're really in love with someone . Plenty of germophobes find themselves dealing with snot and vomit without a single complaint the first time their S.O . gets sick around them ... and let 's face it : even the smelliest farts aren't- quite as repulsive when they come from the butthole of the person we 're crazy for . <h> 4 . Literally Every Song You Hear Reminds You Of Them <p> Of course the romantic songs on the radio tend to remind you of the person you 're currently romanticizing , but when " like " starts turning into " love , " it 's not just the sweet songs that make you think of your honey . The upbeat party songs make you think of how your heart dances when you 're with them , and the breakup songs make you think about how sad you would be- if you two were to ever be separated ( which is totally- never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <h> 5 . Pain Is n't As Painful <p> They say that love hurts , but research has suggested that love actually makes things hurt a lot- less . Researchers from Stanford University - gathered up 15 college students , all of whom claimed to be " deeply in love " with someone , and placed a heated probe in the palms of their hands . They then tested their brains ' pain responses while having the subjects look at a picture of an acquaintance , then at a picture of their loved one . The results showed that looking at a photo of their one true love reduced moderate pain by up to 40 percent , while severe pain was reduced up to 15 percent . The next time you get a headache , test the intensity of your love by staring at the object of your affection and see if it helps while you 're waiting for the ibuprofen to kick in. <h> 6 .

You 're doing punnet squares to figure out how your children would look . You 're freaking out about the wedding that is years away from even being planned . Even though evolution would probably applaud your efforts for finding a suitable mate that could help you pass on your genes , it 's still a little freaky when you realize that you might have really found the person you 'll be spending the rest of your life with . <h> 7 .

You Finish Each Other 's ... <p> But only if the other person says it 's OK . In fact , you might even make them a sandwich using your dad 's secret sandwich recipe or take them to that amazing sandwich place you always went to as you were growing up . Blame it on all the doting grandmas or just our inherent need to make sure the ones we love do n't starve to death , but at one point or another , you and the subject of your own personal love story are going to be stuffing each other 's faces with delicious foods . <h> 9 . You Do n't Even Notice Other Attractive People <p> When you 're just " in like , " you 'll probably still notice all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once your feelings progress to the next level , though , something akin to magic happens : all the hot people become invisible ! Sure , there are people who are- objectively attractive ...

But your desire to kiss , bang , or cuddle with anyone else basically disappears once you realize that you 're already in love with the best-looking person on the planet . <h> 10 .

Snapchat allows users ' messages to vanish after seconds . It is being reported that Yahoo may invest millions of dollars in the start up firm . ( Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images ) Source : Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images News/Getty Images <p> Oh , Snapchat . Whether you 're an avid user or a naysayer , it 's impossible to deny that this photo-based app has become a major part of the social media landscape ( heck , even politicians are using it these days ) . But did you know that- Snapchat has some hidden features- that enable you to do all sorts of wild things you might hitherto have thought impossible ? Welcome to the world of hacks , done by people who are way better at technology than I am- " - or ever will be . <p> In case you 've been living under a rock , Snapchat is a messaging app that let 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the recipient 's phone before they disappear into the mysterious underworld of lost data . The images are customizable with text ( including emoji ! ) and a tool that let 's you use your fingers to draw on them , ultimately allowing for a more immersive communication experience . According to Snapchat 's website , the platform- is the best way to reach users between the ages of 13 and 34 . Among that age bracket , 60 percent of people with smartphones have Snapchat downloaded to their devices . Daily , there are over three billion video views and 100 million active users on the app- " - numbers which are likely increasing as we speak. - <p> With such a huge user base , it 's important to have your Snapchat game on fleek- at all times . But some strategies might be more obvious than others. - Here are a few lesser-known features of the app that will instantly up your Snapchat game . <h> 1 . Longer Lines Of Text <p> Feeling creatively stunted by the text limit ? Use this little trick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iPhone , go to the native Notes app and open up a blank note . Hit enter a few times , and then copy all that blank space . Then , head over to Snapchat , tap your screen , and paste . All that copied blank space will appear as a text box , and you can type away to your heart 's desire ! You can even customize the text as usual , like so : <h> 2 . Video Chat With Your Friends <p> Very few people know that you can actually video chat with the app , thus making the " chat " part of its name even more accurate . When you go to the screen that shows you who you 've sent snaps to and received snaps from , you can swipe a username right to chat with the person . If the person is online at the same time as you , a blue circle will appear on the bottom right by the " send a chat " box . If they 're not online , this box will appear yellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user will see a little bubble appear on their screen that has your face in it . If they do the same , you both can video chat ! - <h> 3 . Find Hidden Colors <p> We 've covered this feature before , - but it 's pretty neat , so it 's worth another mention . If you 're an iPhone user , the color palette offered on Snapchat does not include white , black , grey , or pink . To change that , tap the drawing tool and press down on the color ribbon Then , while still holding your finger on the screen , trace down to the bottom left or bottom right of the screen to get black . Move it up and down to select pink , grey , and white . It 's super easy and could spruce up your snaps significantly ! - <h> 4 . Give Your Snaps A Custom Color Filter <p> Everyone knows that you can swipe right after you take a shot to get various filters on your snaps . There 's black-and-white , a geo-tag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what if your skin looks more fabulous filtered through pink ? Or gold ? You can get essentially any color filter you want with the simple use of an emoji . For the one above , I took a heart emoji and used two fingers to expand its size , like so : <p> Make the emoji so large that it starts to get pixelated . If you do it just right and are able to cover your screen with a translucent pixel at the edge of your emoji , it makes for a lovely filter . <p> So now you know how to take your Snapchat game from " pretty good " to " basically professional . " Go forth and conquer , young snappers.

You could finally fulfill that childhood dream of staying in the movie theater all day and watching every movie that just came out . <p> According to Lowe , the movie theater industry needs to change if it 's going to stay alive , and a subscription could be just the ticket .

From waterfall braids to braided fauxhawks , we are all about braid innovation on the regular . But , not everyone knows the basics of braiding beyond the simple three strand situation . Before we get too carried away on the braid front , here are three basic braids to get you prepped and ready for all sorts of braided hairstyles . <p> - <h> Fishtail Braid <p> A fishtail braid is one of those braids that looks far more complicated than it is . You literally have two sections of hair and will be pulling small sections from the outside of each section and crossing it over into the opposite side . It 's that easy ! <p> 1 . Comb all of your hair over to one side . <p> 2 . Split your hair into two even sections . <p> 3 . Pick up a small piece of hair from the outside of the section closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other section furthest from your face . <p> 4 . Now pick up another small section of hair from the outside of the second section and cross it over into the section of hair closest to your face . <p> 5 . Now use your pointer finger to pick up another section of hair from the first section . <p> 6 . Use your opposite pointer finger to transfer the section over to the opposite side just like you did in step one . <p> 7 . At this point you should be back to two sections of hair . <p> 8 . Repeat the same process over and over back and forth until you get to the ends of your hair . <p> 9 . Once you are to the ends , use a small elastic to secure your braid . <p> - <h> French Braid <p> To create a French braid , think of it as basically making a traditional braid starting at the top of your head , then working your way down while adding in pieces of hair . <p> 1 . Begin by pulling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width will be almost to the outside of your eyes . <p> 2 . Divide that section into three smaller sections and cross the outside piece over the center piece just as you would with a traditional braid . <p> 3 . Now cross the other section over the center section . <p> 4 . This takes a little practice , but you can do it ! Hold all three sections of hair with the hand opposite of the side you are pulling the first section of hair up from . In this case , her left hand is holding all three braid strands and she is picking up a section of hair on the right with her right hand . <p> 5 . Place that section over the original outer strand of hair you first crossed over the center section with in step 2 . See how you have three strands again ? <p> 6 . Now it is time to reverse it . Go to the opposite side and repeat the process of pulling up a new section of hair that you will add to the second strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back to three strands . <p> 8 . Continue the steps as you shift your hands toward the back of your head . With practice you can do this without a mirror . If you need to see you may need to rig up a mirror on the wall across from a larger mirror slightly angled so you can see what you are doing . <p> 9 . Once you get to a point where there is no more hair to pull into your braid , you will simply braid the remaining hair in a traditional braid . <p> 10 . Once finished , secure with a small elastic . <p> - <h> Dutch ( Inside Out ) Braid <p> The Dutch braid is basically an inside out French braid . The challenge of this braid is sort of like that game where you pat your head with one hand and try and make a circular movement on your tummy with the other hand . Your hands want to cross the hair over each other instead of under each other . <p> 1 . Place a side part in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is totally fine ) . <p> 2 . Pull half a little less than half of your hair up into one section . Note : You could start this on top like a normal French braid , but that is a little more advanced . We are demonstrating a more simple approach for our first timers . <p> 3 . Divide the section into three smaller sections . <p> 4 . Take the outside section underneath the center section . <p> 5 . Now take the other outside section and cross it underneath the center section . <p> 6 . Hold the three sections with one hand , and pull up another section of hair like you did in the French braid tutorial . <p> 7 . Add that section to the outer section of your braid and cross it underneath the center into the other side . <p> 8 . Repeat the same thing on the opposite side . <p> 9 . Continue on until you run out of hair to add into your braid then just braid the remaining hair keeping the same underneath motion until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an elastic ! <p> And there you have it !

We recommend taking a picture of these things to your hardware store if you want to get the same goodies . The rest of our materials are pretty standard issue in the jewelry department . <p> Old worn out t-shirts work best for jewelry-making as they are n't as stiff as brand new ones .

Place a piece of tubing in your tubing cutter to score your copper . Then use a handsaw to cut .

Consider The Placement <p> If you 're truly stuck in a commitment-phobic spiral of sadness , perhaps getting a- hidden tattoo- is the best idea .

Doing some thorough research into your design and any possible meanings attached to it will give you more confidence in committing . If you know everything there is to know about tattooing and about your specific tattoo , you 'll feel safe and ready . <h> 9 .

Ladies NEVER ! To properly apply your foundation using your fingers , you should only be using a dime-sized amount of product . In makeup artist speak , this is actually a lot . You want this much with this method because the heat from your digits will press the product deeper into your skin , which inevitably uses up more product . Furthermore , you want to pump or slowly pour the foundation onto the *back* of your hand . The back of your hand is almost always cleaner than your palm , plus that resting position is more natural than your palms facing up , so it will be more comfortable to work with . <p> Use your ring and middle finger to pick up a small amount of product and apply it to each cheek , your forehead , down the bridge of your nose , your chin and slightly down onto your neck before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperse the product more evenly . <p> Then , blend all of the product onto your face gently , gently being the operative word " - a heavy hand can result in thick , cake-y coverage , so apply in swift sweeping upward motions for most even coverage . <p> You can see that after I caught her mid-beauty faux pas , Cecilia ended up blending her foundation well . So remember , when applying- with your fingers : <p> " Use a dime-size amount of product . " Squeeze product onto the back of your hand to apply . " Disperse to areas of your face- before you blend . " Use a gentle touch " your ring and middle finger work best for this . <p> - <h> Brush Application <p> Now that Cecelia was privy to the dime-size rule , she went ahead and squeezed out that same amount of product onto the back of her hand and picked up her foundation brush . STOP ! When you 're using a brush to apply foundation , you actually only need half of that amount , since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face + fingers . Trust me : your brush is- made for picking up that small amount and dispersing it evenly wherever you sweep it . So squeeze or pour a pea-size dollop of foundation onto the back of your hand for this technique . <p> Before we move on , let 's chat about brushes . You want to use a flat foundation brush , preferably with synthetic fibers ( natural bristle brushes absorb more makeup ) " you can find these at your local drugstore or on boutique beauty sites . And you want to make sure it 's clean ! You would n't cut your food with a dull knife , right ? So do n't apply your makeup with a dirty brush " it wo n't apply as flawlessly as it should . <p> Here 's the only similarity between the finger and brush application : the areas of coverage . Place the product on- each cheek , your forehead , down the bridge of your nose , on your chin and slightly down onto your neck . Then , sweep down the nose and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the tips of the bristles to blend . <p> When applied like this , a foundation brush will give you a lighter topical coverage than when you apply with your fingers , making it an easier way to get the job done for those- of you who are- budding beauty DIY-ers . Just remember , when you 're applying with a brush : <p> " Use a flat , synthetic foundation brush . " Use a pea-size amount of product . " Squeeze product onto the back of your hand to apply . " Disperse to areas of your face- before you blend . " Use upward and back to apply . <p> Now that you 've got the lowdown on both of these methods , give them both a try to see which one suits your style better !

The infographic , designed by- The Greatist , made it painfully obvious just how quickly and dramatically our beauty ideals have shifted over the past 100 years . Now it looks as though Buzzfeed has piggybacked on that concept with a video that covers not only the past 100 years of female body ideas , but the past 3,000 . <p> The video starts off in 1292 B.C ( the Egyptian Era ) with a slender woman who has narrow shoulders and a high waist . We then move to Ancient Greece , where things get a whole lot curvier , with full-bodied hips and light skin . Then the video progresses into the Han Dynasty , which features a gal of much smaller proportions who has small feet and a slim waist . Because there obviously was n't photography during these eras , the beauty ideals featured from these periods have primarily been drawn from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian Renaissance we jump into the centuries we 're a little more familiar with : the Victorian Era , Roaring ' 20s , Golden Age of Hollywood , etc . There we saw all the classic stick-figured flappers , curvy ' 50s ladies and ' 90s Heroin-chic ideals . The video sums up postmodern beauty ( from the ' 00s until today ) as someone who displays a healthy sort of skinny , with flat abs , full breasts and a curvy bottom ( pretty much Kim Kardashian ) . <p> We hope that after taking a look at this video and The Greatists infographic , it 's become crystal clear that there is no one perfect body .

When it comes to lips , so many gals keep things natural for fear of glosses that are way too sticky , lipsticks that come off too easily , lip stains that look way too vampy and about a million other things . But , we 're here to give you a 101 crash course on the difference between all of those lip products so you can choose something that works for you ! <p> We went with a classic pink hue for each of the products , so you can see how each creates a totally different lip look . <h> Lip Balm <p> Lip Balm : Lip balm is typically a wax-like substance that is intended to moisturize , protect and nourish your lips . While traditionally most lip balms are clear , more and more brands are coming out with new formulations with a variety of tints and flavors so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your pucker . <p> Who should use : The simple gal who does not like to feel like she is overdoing it but would like to dabble in color all the while conditioning perhaps drier , chapped lips . <h> Lip Stain <p> Lip Stain : Lip stains usually come in liquid or gel form and are meant to stain your lips for a longer lasting , minimal product application that does not require touching up . Stains tend to be a little drying so avoid them if you have chapped lips . <p> Who should use : The gal who will not remember to reapply her lip color or one who is afraid of smearing or smudging throughout the day . <h> Lip Gloss <p> Lip Gloss : Traditionally , lip gloss was a way to get a more glossy effect with minimal color . These days there are certain lip glosses that have been formulated with much more pigment and can almost have the effect of a lip stain once the glossy sheen wears off . <p> Who should use : EVERYONE ! ( Okay , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many different types of lip gloss , I firmly believe there is something for everyone . You could get something really sticky and long lasting full of color . Go for a lip plumping feature if you want to punch up those smackers . Or , go for something lightweight and only mildly tinted but full of moisturizing nourishing components . Of course , you can also go totally glittery with your gloss too ! <h> Shiny Lipstick <p> Shiny Lipstick : There are many different levels of shiny lipstick , but just to keep it simple we chose a shiny lipstick in the same hue as the matte .

A beautiful arrangement can transform a room and be an eye-catching , jaw-dropping piece . If you 've always wondered how to arrange flowers- but do n't know where to begin , do n't worry " we can help . The wonderful ladies of Farmgirl Flowers have created a 25-minute beginner- Flower Arranging 101 class , which will teach you- all you need to know about flowers and arranging . For now , we 'll walk you through the steps to create a gorgeous wild arrangement that will turn heads . <p> Our focal flowers were roses and peonies . These blooms are a bit larger than the others , so keep that in mind when you pick your focal flowers . <p> We have a lot of secondary flowers ! <p> And some lovely little fillers . <p> Before you start arranging your flowers , you 'll need to prepare your vase . Soak the oasis in water until it is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's okay if it does n't completely cover the bottom of the vase . Now fill your vase about halfway with water . <p> Next , - you need to process- your blooms . Remove the leaves and cut the stem at an angle . If you 're cutting a branch , you can make a snip in the stem to help it absorb water . <p> One technique to make your arrangement wild is to add branches . We went with flowering quince , which blooms in late winter . The branches are different lengths and are set in the oasis at different angles . This part is really important , as you are creating the structure for your arrangement . Pay attention to the placement of each branch . The story you are telling with these flowers starts now . <p> Next we added dusty miller . We placed the leaves- in the oasis at different angles and created a shelf that will support the rest of our blooms . <p> Time to add your focal flowers . These are the blooms that will stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the shape of the flower and add it to the arrangement- in a way that highlights its beauty and enhances the overall shape of the arrangement . <p> Our second focal flower is a peony . It 's always a good idea to group your flowers . Rather than creating a polka-dotted look , put multiple flowers of the same type in a little pod . As you can see , we have three peonies together as a little team . <p> Now add your secondary flowers . Again , making small pods will keep your arrangement from looking spotted . Another tip for the wild look is to pull your flowers slightly away from one another . When all of the flowers are at the same level , you start getting that rounded look , which is n't a bad thing , but it 's not going to result in an organic shape . <p> Looking good so far ! <p> Finally , it 's time for the fillers .

This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers to flow in their natural direction and then place them where they fit the shape of your arrangement . Jasmine provides a great example . If you hold up a piece , you 'll see that the vine twists and turns in all directions . Do n't fight the natural curves . Use them to your benefit and place them where they will create some interest in your floral work of art . <p> Do n't forget to pull the blooms out just a hair- so there is breathing room around each one . Allow a few to be substantially longer or shorter , to pop out rather than sinking into the arrangement . Create flow and do n't be afraid to let your flowers fall over the edge of the vase . <p> The beauty of flower arranging is that you can easily try again if you 're not happy with the shape at the end .

Whether you are starting with a clean slate and can dictate the layout or are working with an existing floor plan , using strategies initiated by routine is the key to a well-functioning nursery . <h> The Changing Routine <p> Here , safety is your priority . It 's ideal to have all your necessities in arm 's reach so you never have to step away and take a hand or eye off of the baby . Have the changing table pad over your dresser where you keep changes of clothes , diapers , wipes and hand sanitizer in the drawers or baskets below .

You 'll never have to leave your baby on the changing table while you have to walk across the room to grab something . It 's great to have the changing table near a window so the baby can look out , making for a great opportunity to get some natural light after naps or in the morning . <h> The Sleep Routine <p> Until becoming a mom , you might not fully appreciate the importance of a good sleep routine and the rituals that signal to the baby that it 's time for sleep . Getting your baby in the mood for sleep is critical .

Within reach should be books , a music player for baby lullabies , sound machine and a dimmer table lamp . If these items are not in arm 's distance , you may find yourself needing to get up and down and disrupting the mood . <p> When laying out a nursery , have the crib against a wall versus under or next to a window . For one , it 's safer , but also prevents draft . Steer clear of tall bookshelves that the baby could climb on when they get mobile , even if you have it secured to the wall .

Make just enough space to have a toy bin and comfortable rug or playmat . Make sure the toy bin is n't too close to the crib so your baby is n't helping themselves to toys when they should be sleeping .
