@@61178116 @1178116/ <p> My 99 LX has the older 12.5KW PowerTech gen set in it , but the engine is a 3-cylinder Isuzu diesel , not a Kubotu . The gen set has been good to me over the years , but now it turns over but wo n't start . I think the fuel flow pump or the fuel injector pump may have bitten the dust . <p> The first symptom was that it ran , but stalled when under load ( three roof ACs running ) . Now , it turns over but wo n't start . I replaced the fuel filter thinking it may be clogged or grunged up , but that did not make any difference . <p> Just looking for ideas on why the engine wo n't crank . <p> bwinter1946 <p> 07-01-2010 , 07:18 PM <p> Air filter OK ? <p> Fuel filter full with no air or air bubbles ? <p> ironmike <p> 07-01-2010 , 07:37 PM <p> Air filter is OK .

Then just barely loosen the injector lines at each cylinder ( maybe 1/2 turn loose ) . Crank the motor a few times until you see fluid coming out of the injector lines . She may try to start at this point . If it does start , let it run and tighten each line while it 's running . You 'll be able to hear and see the motor smooth out as you tighten up each line . If it does n't start at point , that 's okay- just make sure you have relatively good fluid flow out of each line . Now tighten them back up and try starting her . She should fire right up . Since you 've tried starting her already , there should be some fuel in the filter . Just add to it with whichever fluid you prefer . <p> Next time when you change the filter , fill it full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack the injectors to get her running by doing so .

However , there is a 12 volt Facet style fuel pump mounted on the generator slide directly underneath the fuel filter on my 97 BMC with a 10KVA Power Tech gennie . That would be on the drivers side on my Gennie . The 37 foot BMC has the radiator in the back with the generator portion towards the front of the bus . It would not be hard to run out the wires or just fashion a jumper wire to run the pump . The pump is connected with normal LONG ... on shovel style connectors and not hard wired if I remember correctly . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 07-03-2010 , 02:04 PM <p> on the yanmar engine there 's an oil pressure sending unit above the starter that controls the electric fuel pump , i jump across the terminals on that sender and it turns the fuel pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wire hanging in the gennie area , just for that purpose . <p> ironmike <p> 07-27-2010 , 04:45 PM <p> Finally got back to this issue and I still need advice . Generator turns over but wo n't start . It sounds like a bad fuel pump to me . At the fuel filter end , I disconnected the fuel line that runs from the fuel pump to the inlet side of the fuel filter and then cranked the genny . No fuel came out of that line . Should n't I see fuel flowing from the line that runs from the fuel pump to the fuel filter if the fuel pump is good ? I 've enclosed a picture and circled the fuel pump in red on the image . Am I missing the boat here ? How do I diagnose a suspected bad fuel pump ? <p> Crit Bliss <p> 07-27-2010 , 04:59 PM <p> Hi Mike , I have the same genny in our FC , you should be able to clearly hear the fuel pump run if you call for the glow plugs , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use the warm/start feature on the control box and listen for the pump , I can hear ours when I go to start ours from inside the coach ! <p> Gentlemen , I finally fixed this problem . The fuel pump for the generator engine was bad . Ordered a new pump online , brand name Facet , part number 40178 . Put the new pump in and after three tries she coughed and cranked right up . <p> This is the older PowerTech genny with the Isuzu 3-cylinder engine . Facet requires an in-line fuel filter BEFORE the fuel pump to keep debris out of it . Bluebird ( or PowerTech ) did NOT have such a filter installed on the coach , however . I 'm gon na order it and install it , it 's Facet part number 479735 . <p> rwoody <p> 08-12-2010 , 06:10 PM <p> were did you order the parts from mike ? <p> ironmike <p> 08-12-2010 , 07:21 PM <p> Woody , I got'em from Pegasus Auto Racing , http : **28;0;TOOLONG both the in-line fuel filter and the fuel pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of one of the pump 's mounting holes @ its base . <p> rwoody <p> 08-12-2010 , 08:15 PM <p> this is a great site with all of the needed pumps on our engines and gen sets thanks for the source mike ' '

' <p> " The bacteria found in human waste are known as friendly beneficial bacteria . These bacteria live to digest organic wastes and turning it into water and carbon dioxide .

Most humans are impatient and want immediate results . <p> Remember , many RV Holding tank chemical treatments are designed to preserve wastes by killing or retarding bacterial action . To eliminate this problem , you should buy bacterial digestant products . They are the products that utilize Mother Nature 's bacterial digestion process to eliminate organic wastes . <p> These new " third generation " products that are available today just speed up this natural decaying process safely and without odors or noxious gases . The basic principle behind how bacterial digestant products work is Mother Natures natural decomposition process . In nature , bacteria need time to adjust to their environment before they can reproduce and begin to digest organic wastes . However , for faster decomposition of organic wastes , the product you select must have the correct combination of bacteria , enzymes and essential nutrients necessary to quickly jump start the bacteria into the digestion process . <p> He also says " Not allowing tissue , paper , sanitary napkins or household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water holding tank will minimize the chances of clogging .

' <p> " The bacteria found in human waste are known as friendly beneficial bacteria . These bacteria live to digest organic wastes and turning it into water and carbon dioxide . Since your back water holding tank receives human wastes that already contain bacteria , Mother Nature will decompose these wastes and turn them into carbon dioxide and water . That is , with adequate ventilation and time . However , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we would like . She takes time to do her job properly . Most humans are impatient and want immediate results . <p> Remember , many RV Holding tank chemical treatments are designed to preserve wastes by killing or retarding bacterial action . To eliminate this problem , you should buy bacterial digestant products . They are the products that utilize Mother Nature 's bacterial digestion process to eliminate organic wastes . <p> These new " third generation " products that are available today just speed up this natural decaying process safely and without odors or noxious gases . The basic principle behind how bacterial digestant products work is Mother Natures natural decomposition process . In nature , bacteria need time to adjust to their environment before they can reproduce and begin to digest organic wastes . However , for faster decomposition of organic wastes , the product you select must have the correct combination of bacteria , enzymes and essential nutrients necessary to quickly jump start the bacteria into the digestion process . <p> He also says " Not allowing tissue , paper , sanitary napkins or household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water holding tank will minimize the chances of clogging .

I am wondering how do you pressurize a main fuel tank that is vented and before that get the air past the check valve that is designed to keep the fuel from running backwards into the fuel tank ? ? <p> My only hard start has been from a slight air leak at the Racor ; a air leak that never showed any bubbles in the glass .

It can not run backwards when the air is introduced because of the check valve , and it certainly can not run up hill .

I took off the entire Racor , fuel lines , check valve etc. and the supply line to the fuel pump is then downhill from the fuel pump ... that is where the air got in . My fault , : mad : : ( <p> The output pressure from the Detroit fuel pump is about 60 PSI ( according to Junior ) and I only hand pumped about 3-4 lbs into the sprayer tank as I was pushing the fuel into the system . In 10 years of working on this coach , this is the first time I have had to completely purge the system . ; ) <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all stressed out ( as I did ) when it would n't start . Push some fuel , crank it , push some fuel , crank it , push some fuel , crank it ; that way the pump is getting fuel without air to pump at high pressure to the injectors . The Racor line to the pump has to be full also . <p> One note of caution : the seal in the fuel pump is on the back side of the pump and any excess high pressure from the inlet ( Racor ) side could possibly push that seal aft and out of the seat . <p> Now back to the Webasto/Primus conversion ...... and while I have all the antifreeze drained , where is my skinny son to reach those compressor coolant lines ...... ? <p> . <p> Don Meyer <p> 03-06-2012 , 11:25 AM <p> I 'm with Leroy here .

I interconnect all my batteries with 2/0 and supply the inverter with 4/0 . But battery to battery and the starter wires are all 2/0 so they can be interchanged or used in a pinch . Also it helps me remember what to use . Remember too big a wire wo n't hurt anything but fuses . : D

The odds of 2 injectors being bad at the same time is about a zillion to one ! If you think you have low pressure there more involved than a bad injector . The first thing you do with any fuel related problem is change all fuel filters . The second thing you do is replace the electric lift pump , or add one if you do n't have one . You need to provide ample fuel to the injector pump , not depend on the injector pump to suck fuel all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one filter . The 3rd thing to check is the return line , make sure its not stopped up , or has a collapsed hose . <p> The Cat injection pump is not prone to go bad , they do have a few seal failures after 20 years or so , but the internals are pretty bullet proof . The injectors are long lasting too , i have changed just one since 1980 . <p> When you loosen the injector lines with the engine running you do n't get a big flood of fuel , there 's not a lot of volume coming through the lines . <p> WE can help you fix this engine , but let 's do it systematically . ( big word for me ! ) <p> I bought an FC one time that would not start , the injection pump was rebuilt by the 3 stooges , 4 different shops worked on it , nobody ever got it running . I bought it , and had it running in one day . Problem ? Ground cable to the starter was bad . What did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That engine would not spin over fast enough to start , has to be fuel , right ? <p> Itchintogo <p> 05-04-2012 , 09:41 AM <p> Good advice Randy . <p> Not sure of the mechanical skill level here but changing injectors is not for beginners either and you should have reasonable skills to do this . <p> I agree 2 injectors bad at the same time ...... sounds weird to me . <p> We have seen those pesky return hoses cause lots of problems on WOG before . <p> I bought an FC one time that would not start , the injection pump was rebuilt by the 3 stooges , 4 different shops worked on it , nobody ever got it running .

Thanks Randy for the advice . The next time I can work on it will be Monday , but I have already changed out both fuel filters which did not affect it at all . It starts instantly . So , on Monday , I will check for lift pump pressure and add another pump if necessary , and check the return line as well . Will 10lbs of pressure be enough for another lift pump ? What do you think about blowing compressed air through the return line into the fuel tank ? <p> sandy dyas <p> 05-04-2012 , 05:39 PM <p> Is there a test for lift pump pressure ? or do I just add an electric lift pump ? <p> iamflagman <p> 05-04-2012 , 05:43 PM <p> Actually the ground on the starter is the block ground , and the fuel solenoid is grounded to the block .

But , head gaskets can fail between two cylinders and not push exhaust into the coolant . I would check compression first if it were mine .

He has hit the nail on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 injectors side by side dieing at the same time are slim to none . The backfiring you are hearing is crossfiring between the cylinders from compression leaking between the 2 cylinders . I would not run the engine anymore as major damage to either the head or the block will be the end result . Ebay has diesel compression testers cheaper than what 1 injector will run . Your next step needs to be a compression test . : eek : And yes you can blow a head gasket with no water in the oil or overheating , or exhaust gas in the cooling system . <p> Itchintogo <p> 05-06-2012 , 01:45 PM <p> This will be interesting to see what happens . Are you losing coolant ? Generally if you are burning antifreeze you get a whitish smoke and it smells funny . <p> I would keep up with Randy 's list and try not to run the engine much because if it happens to be burning antifreeze that will score things up fast . <p> Thanks for all of the help .

You have a bigger issue with the " popping " noise . <p> Lance <p> 05-06-2012 , 02:25 PM <p> Sandy , Almost forgot , when doing the compression test make sure you have either the glow plugs or injectors removed on the affected cylinders at the same time or erronous readings may result . Compression should be 260 lbs with no more than 10% difference between cylinders . You need to do the test on at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders against . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 05-06-2012 , 02:52 PM <p> Can you tell if the " Popping " is in the exhaust pipe or the air cleaner ?

When i suggested fuel pressure we had not yet gotten the full story , i did n't know about the back firing . <p> Rick <p> 05-06-2012 , 03:36 PM <p> Sometimes getting to the problem is like peeling an onion . <p> sandy dyas <p> 05-06-2012 , 09:50 PM <p> The backfiring seems as if it is in the exhaust rather than the breather . It only pops when you give it a lot of excelleration . I suppose to check compression I pull the valve cover and injector .

@@61178137 @1178137/ <p> On three occasions in the last year or so I 've had my check engine light come on with a corresponding power derating . The error code is PID 103 . This error code translates to " turbo overspeed " . I do n't have a turbo speed sensor so this PID has always been confusing . I 've noted that the PID occurrences correllated with work that DD performed to address a recall . The safety recall notice , 06C-4 and/or 07C-4 , pertains to a potential fire condition related to a turbo charger failure and subsequent oil injection into the exhaust system . My engine is a 2002 with DDEC IV . I 've also noted that the error code occurred on full power climbs at altitude , Eisenhower Pass on HWY 70 for example . <p> Well , today I managed to take some time to track down the source of the PID . A conversation with Detroit Diesel in Nashville Tn confirmed that the recall work included the installation of an ambient barometric pressure sensor and a reflash of the ECM . To detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometric pressure and turbo pressure . When the ignition key is turned on a baseline ambient pressure is recorded . While underway the ECM monitors both pressures . If the ambient tapers off while also experiencing a decrease in turbo pressure , a CEL active event is logged using PID 103 . The pre-EGR engines do n't have a turbo speed sensor so PID 103 was overloaded to also mean Low Barometric Pressure . <p> What I 've been experiencing is a decrease in ambient barometric pressure due to an 11K ft mountain pass climb , along with a slight decrease in turbo pressure ( 30psi to 27psi or so ) due to thinning air , and a resulting false CEL with power derating . <p> To resume travels , I need to pull over , turn off the engine , wait 4 seconds or so , and restart allowing the new ambient barometric pressure to be recorded . DD in Nashville has had several complaints identical to mine . <p> DD informed me that there is no remedy to the false CEL . There 's no new software version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the newly installed ambient barometric pressure sensor , at least none that the factory is willing to do . They also said that aggravating factors could be anything that might reduce turbo pressure including a clogged air cleaner , a leaky Charge Air Cooler ( surprise ! ) , a worn turbo ( particularly the exhaust turbine ) , or any other leaks in the intake circuit that might compromise sustained turbo boost . Although in my case DD thought my turbo boost pressures to be normal . DD suggested that I renew the ambient barometric sensor and the turbo boost sensor as my current devices may be slightly out of calibration . <p> The end result however is that for those of us who have had this recall work implemented , we may occasionally experience spurious PID 103 FMI 8 active codes ( and power deratings ) that really have nothing to do with " turbo speed " and that are n't due to a a failed turbo and pending engine fire , but are simply false alarms due to climbing a serious mountain pass . Detroit Diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too . <p> davidmbrady <p> 08-21-2009 , 09:53 PM <p> Upon retrospection a clearer picture is emerging . There are 3 sensors involved : <p> I thinks what 's happening is that the ECM is taking the delta between the barometric pressure sensor and the air inlet pressure sensor ( corrected for turbo boost ) to predict a conflagration in the engine compartment . <p> The air inlet pressure is essentially the pressure outside the bus adjacent to the air filter plus the turbo boost pressure . The barometric pressure sensor is the air pressure inside the engine compartment . By taking the turbo pressure corrected delta between the two , the ECM can determine if the pressure inside the engine compartment is dropping relative to outside pressure . This would be indicative of a fire . ( Trying to guess what the software is doing ) . <p> As I climb the two pressures diverge and I get PID 103 FMI 8 and a CEL . I 'm thinking that with the engine off I need to verify that my barometric pressure sensor is reading the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stuff ? <p> parris001 <p> 08-21-2009 , 10:09 PM <p> Detroit has a lot of software and programming issues right now . It 's so bad that on the Prevost , depending on what the complaint is we discourage our customers from getting " repairs " made which may require a reprogram because often times the cure is worse than the original ailment . <p> Covington Nashville is not the greatest resource for help either . I do n't have a better recommendation for where to send you , although I 'm sure that somewhere out there you 're sure to find someone more knowledgeable . The only exception to this is Justin . He 's a pretty busy guy ( because he 's the only one there that has a clue ) , but if you can get him on the phone he may be able to help you . <p> davidmbrady <p> 08-21-2009 , 10:47 PM <p> Thanks Jeff , <p> Justin is the person who performed the recall on my bus .

I 've learned a bunch since then . I 'd like to know what your exhaust gas temperatures are , but I do n't think you have a gauge ... Do you see any black smoke coming from the exhaust ? Do your coolant temps quickly escalate ? Have you tested your charge air cooler ( CAC ) for excessive leak down ? There 's a DD spec out there somewhere . You pressurize the CAC up to 30 psi and then record the pressure drop in a 15s period . Any pressure drop less than 5 psi is okay .

Lot of similarities in the two brands . And a lot of good folks on the Newel board . Good to have you and would love to have you stop by when you are in Oklahoma . <p> davidmbrady <p> 07-25-2012 , 10:11 AM <p> Hi Tom , <p> I wrote the stuff in this thread a long time ago and I 'm not sure how much of it I believe anymore . The ' turbo speed ' reading is calculated from other sensors . <p> Here 's something I pulled off the diesel engine trader website . There 's a couple guys over there who really know what their S60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things ; turbo waste gate controller leaking or sticking ; the temp and pressure sensor ( combo sensor ) in the intake manifold ; engine speed sensor ; ambient air pressure sensor or if you 've changed ECM 's ; it could be a calibration problem but it 's not derating you so I 'd be looking at the waste gate and controller - turbo speed is calculated by a reading from all the above mentioned sensors . LONG ... <p> I had a cracked charge air cooler ( CAC ) and while in there I replaced my turbo and the PID 103 code went away . Sounds like the pro 's are associating the code more with the waste gate then the CAC . I do n't think it has anything to do with the barometric sensor . <p> I got ta drive the bus to Charlotte NC today . My cell phone , 703-297-6274 , is the best place to reach me . <p> DonB <p> 07-25-2012 , 02:19 PM <p> Tom , I think you are a good friend of my friend Michael , in Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOF rally in Albuquerque in October .

The odds of 2 injectors being bad at the same time is about a zillion to one ! If you think you have low pressure there more involved than a bad injector . The first thing you do with any fuel related problem is change all fuel filters . The second thing you do is replace the electric lift pump , or add one if you do n't have one . You need to provide ample fuel to the injector pump , not depend on the injector pump to suck fuel all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one filter . The 3rd thing to check is the return line , make sure its not stopped up , or has a collapsed hose . <p> The Cat injection pump is not prone to go bad , they do have a few seal failures after 20 years or so , but the internals are pretty bullet proof . The injectors are long lasting too , i have changed just one since 1980 . <p> When you loosen the injector lines with the engine running you do n't get a big flood of fuel , there 's not a lot of volume coming through the lines . <p> WE can help you fix this engine , but let 's do it systematically . ( big word for me ! ) <p> I bought an FC one time that would not start , the injection pump was rebuilt by the 3 stooges , 4 different shops worked on it , nobody ever got it running .

Spend the time to get an proper diagnosis ... before pulling the heads ... <p> Yes . This is true . Usually you will have exhaust gasses in the coolant . But , head gaskets can fail between two cylinders and not push exhaust into the coolant . I would check compression first if it were mine . Not easy to do , but would confirm a failure and is easier than just pulling the heads to go looking for a problem .

He has hit the nail on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 injectors side by side dieing at the same time are slim to none . The backfiring you are hearing is crossfiring between the cylinders from compression leaking between the 2 cylinders . I would not run the engine anymore as major damage to either the head or the block will be the end result . Ebay has diesel compression testers cheaper than what 1 injector will run . Your next step needs to be a compression test . : eek : And yes you can blow a head gasket with no water in the oil or overheating , or exhaust gas in the cooling system . <p> Itchintogo <p> 05-06-2012 , 01:45 PM <p> This will be interesting to see what happens . Are you losing coolant ? Generally if you are burning antifreeze you get a whitish smoke and it smells funny . <p> I would keep up with Randy 's list and try not to run the engine much because if it happens to be burning antifreeze that will score things up fast . <p> Thanks for all of the help .

Compression should be 260 lbs with no more than 10% difference between cylinders . You need to do the test on at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders against . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 05-06-2012 , 02:52 PM <p> Can you tell if the " Popping " is in the exhaust pipe or the air cleaner ?

I 'm not Randy either . The best way to nail the problem , is to make up a clear plastic fuel line , and connect it in series with the fuel system . Look for bubbles in the fuel , and if you see any , your problem is before the connection . I 'd start before the hand pump first . This may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , The " O " rings on the hand pump may leak air , when pulled out , and running , if they are dried up , or worn . If you do n't isolate the problem using the clear hose , you can be guessing for a long time , along with spending money where you do n't have to . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 08-10-2010 , 07:28 PM <p> The guys have it handled ! Listen to them . <p> Bill Pape <p> 08-10-2010 , 08:03 PM <p> because the filter is not full ? <p> Ken , It is usually a filter , gasket , check the Racor &amp; the associated fittings , filters full no air . <p> JD33 <p> 08-10-2010 , 08:23 PM <p> FWIW , Those Cat hand primer pumps fail regularly and you will have a hard time filling the filters and getting pressure in the lines with a bad primer pump .

The gage should read a few psi positive pressure at idle , under load it is a vacuum gage , yellow is OK , Red is not a good thing . 
@@61178151 @1178151/ <p> Does anyone have any suggestions how to find a cheaper replacement control module for the engine cooling fan on my 1998-60 series engine ? The problem is that it intermittently cuts in and out mostly on all the time without cycling . When I unplug the unit the fan is always on .

Thanks <p> davidmbrady <p> 06-15-2012 , 10:22 PM <p> Hi Gerhard , <p> Can you snap a photo of the electronic control box that you found ? What you have does n't ring a bell with me . My understanding is that the DD S60 fan speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic control module ) which is bolted to your engine 's sump pan , curb side . <p> The ECM reads engine sensors and turns on the fan accordingly . The ECM sends an electrical signal to the Sauer Danfoss part that I mentioned earlier . The Sauer Danfoss part sends a proportional hydraulic pilot signal to the hydraulic fan motor to control the fan speed . <p> Yours may be different . I 'd really like to see what that sealed electrical box is that you mentioned . <p> Gerhard <p> 06-16-2012 , 02:52 PM <p> Hi David , enclosed are two pictures . The fan control module , as wellas the unknown module in the waterproof box that I suppose has something to do with the tag lift issue , which has of course nothing to do with the fan control . As I mentioned the fan practically runs all the time and intermittendly cycles on-off when idling . I took the control box off before and checked the electrical connections carefully but it still does its cut in-out at random , But as I said I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for a new control unit . The unknowned unmarked module from the front is puzzle to me , why did't they identify it by naming it ? ? ? Thanks again David , have a nice day . <p> HummerH1 <p> 06-17-2012 , 09:47 AM <p> I think I might take a temp gun and shoot the radiator inlet and outlets when the fan switches off and on . If the temps are right when it switches off and on there could be another issue causing the short cycling , maybe a plugged radiator and the control unit might be operating properly . Just a thought .

Also on my 1982 FC35 Cat 3208NA engine the dipstick tube entered the side flange of the engine block and then into the oil pan and not the side of the oil pan .

Arrangement # and Serial # from the right side rocker arm cover will allow CAT to determine which Tube and Stick was needed when built . That will not be true if the pan has been swapped or the rocker arm cover has been changed . : confused : : confused : <p> Rick <p> 09-25-2010 , 11:32 AM <p> At some point in the very near future one of us need to crawl under our bus and measure the Oil Pan . That should clear this oil capacity question up . The blocks are the same . The oil cooler should be close to the same . Do all the 3208 use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the pan . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 09-25-2010 , 12:06 PM <p> i would be willing to guess that even though there are different configurations of dip sticks that they should all measure the same . The depth of the oil in relation to the block or the crankshaft is what 's important . A deeper pan will hold more oil , and more is good IMO . Some pans even have kickouts or bulges o the sides for more volume . But , even if the pan holds more oil , its the space between the oil and the crank that matters . <p> OOOH&lt;the dipstick and the tube should be a matched set . <p> Christian <p> 09-25-2010 , 03:33 PM <p> Well I will be checking out that oil pan sometime Monday . I 'm sure glad you guys brought this to my attention . I wonder how close to the top of the oil pan should the oil be . I will measure my oil pan and its dimentions <p> I imagine that the frontal view will be as wide as the lower block . Except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side view from the right side would clear this up . <p> I will take several shots Monday . <p> I suspect I am wrong because the manuals that I have where not for RV 's in general but specifically for the 3208 motor in general . <p> I do not know for a fact that it is 12 quarts except for the PO said it was 12 . <p> Randy how far does the crank movement go below the mating point of the oil pan I was guessing 1-2 inches or less ? I suspect that the 1/2 inch plug on the right side of the pan might have been the return oil from the turbo option I do n't have . The reasoning is that the turbo often churns up the oil to the point of foam or froth . I understand it would back up and push oil through the turbo seals if not dumped on top of the oil level . Just a thought . <p> Thanks ! <p> Rick <p> 09-25-2010 , 04:50 PM <p> Why would you think the turbo causes froth or foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 09-25-2010 , 05:36 PM <p> 5 gallons , here are pics with measurements <p> Rick <p> 09-25-2010 , 06:01 PM <p> Looks like mine Gardner . <p> Stephen <p> 09-25-2010 , 06:28 PM <p> our 77 n/a was 12 quarts <p> Bill Pape <p> 09-25-2010 , 06:59 PM <p> Our 300 HP Turbo w/air cooler is happy at 17 , 18 quarts , that is half on the dip stick , more will just disappear in 500 miles or less , no need for more oil for 3000 miles or more . The more you add the more it burns . Too much oil is probably not good for the rear housing &amp; rear seals . <p> Mike Hohnstein <p> 09-25-2010 , 09:11 PM <p> That 's my deal Bill . 4k miles this trip and no oil added . After crossing the Missiouri in SD it get 's pretty flat , put the Brownie in OD , cruised to Blue Earth MN @ 70/75 pulling the F-150 and cab over camper .

Explain please . Take a look at any modern day turbocharger . You will notice first that the inlet Oil pressure tube is a smaller line say 3/8 or so then look at the bottom of the turbo where it dumps the oil back into the pan and its size it usually twice the size of the supply . <p> The reason is if the return is the same size as the supply the spinning turbo and heat ( mabe moisture ) expansion causes the oil to froth up and it becomes dificult to push through the tube and will go past the seals in the turbo . <p> I suppose most of the frothing is the extreme heat in the turbo and the turbulance at the berring spinning 40,000 rpm ( Imagine soapy water in a blender ) . <p> Imagine filling 1/2 soapy water in a 2 liter bottle shake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way with water . It can be done but most of the water spills over the sides because of the bubbles . That is how the turbo leaks through the seals if it is not draining on top of the oil level from a large tube . <p> warbucks13477 <p> 09-26-2010 , 10:35 AM <p> Randy I have to disagree with you about the length of dip sticks for the 3208 Cat . The length depends on the length of the dip stick tube . The tube on the 1982 FC35 was one that BB installed so that the customer could check the oil by lefting the rear part of the doghouse top and lifting the stick from the very rear top of the doghouse . That means that particular stick was a lot longer then one where the tube was located near the middle of the doghouse more then 1/2 way down the doghouse . As I noted in my previous post the information on the passenger side valve cover as to the arrangement etc was not accurate since the arrangement number when researched by the Cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Cat 3208 forum members have this kind of dipstick location ? And I suppose the 300HP 3208 Cats in the SP models have an entirely different stick length also since the engine is located in the rear of the coach facing backwards.:eek : <p> Oh and one more thing . The two different Cat oil pans can be identified by where the sump is , either front or back . 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 09-26-2010 , 11:15 AM <p> Randy I have to disagree with you about the length of dip sticks for the 3208 Cat .

The tube on the 1982 FC35 was one that BB installed so that the customer could check the oil by lefting the rear part of the doghouse top and lifting the stick from the very rear top of the doghouse . That means that particular stick was a lot longer then one where the tube was located near the middle of the doghouse more then 1/2 way down the doghouse . As I noted in my previous post the information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not accurate since the arrangement number when researched by the Cat dealer referred to a totally different stick . How many other Cat 3208 forum members have this kind of dipstick location ? And I suppose the 300HP 3208 Cats in the SP models have an entirely different stick length also since the engine is located in the rear of the coach facing backwards.:eek : <p> Oh and one more thing . The two different Cat oil pans can be identified by where the sump is , either front or back . Tom , i was probably not clear on what i was trying to say . What i 'm trying to say is as long as you use a matched set ( dipstick and tube ) it should not matter which set you use. ( other than ease of checking the oil ) The end of the stick with the marks on it should only go so deep in the oil pan , because Cat wants the oil level in relation to the crank to be a set measurement . And yes , there may be a rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still use the same dipstick and tube for both sumps , the mounting hole will be at the same height , just further forward or back . And yes , there may be 10 different lengths of dip sticks , depending on the application of the engine , bus , truck , bull dozer etc . But they should all read the same if interchanged.

The depth of the oil in relation to the block or the crankshaft is what 's important . A deeper pan will hold more oil , and more is good IMO . Some pans even have kickouts or bulges o the sides for more volume . But , even if the pan holds more oil , its the space between the oil and the crank that matters . <p> OOOH&lt;the dipstick and the tube should be a matched set . <p> Christian <p> 09-25-2010 , 03:33 PM <p> Well I will be checking out that oil pan sometime Monday . I 'm sure glad you guys brought this to my attention . I wonder how close to the top of the oil pan should the oil be . I will measure my oil pan and its dimentions <p> I imagine that the frontal view will be as wide as the lower block . Except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side view from the right side would clear this up . <p> I will take several shots Monday . <p> I suspect I am wrong because the manuals that I have where not for RV 's in general but specifically for the 3208 motor in general . <p> I do not know for a fact that it is 12 quarts except for the PO said it was 12 . <p> Randy how far does the crank movement go below the mating point of the oil pan I was guessing 1-2 inches or less ? I suspect that the 1/2 inch plug on the right side of the pan might have been the return oil from the turbo option I do n't have . The reasoning is that the turbo often churns up the oil to the point of foam or froth . I understand it would back up and push oil through the turbo seals if not dumped on top of the oil level .

Explain please . Take a look at any modern day turbocharger . You will notice first that the inlet Oil pressure tube is a smaller line say 3/8 or so then look at the bottom of the turbo where it dumps the oil back into the pan and its size it usually twice the size of the supply . <p> The reason is if the return is the same size as the supply the spinning turbo and heat ( mabe moisture ) expansion causes the oil to froth up and it becomes dificult to push through the tube and will go past the seals in the turbo . <p> I suppose most of the frothing is the extreme heat in the turbo and the turbulance at the berring spinning 40,000 rpm ( Imagine soapy water in a blender ) . <p> Imagine filling 1/2 soapy water in a 2 liter bottle shake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way with water .

If you search the forum there is a good video of how they work . It real short and imformative . It 's real easy . The hardest part was just finding it ! <p> I confused here and it 's not the first time but how does the sporlan valve direct water to a water heater . The sporlan on my coach directs water flow between the water tank to fill and to the entire coach plumbing when in the off position . If it were the sporlan you would not get water at all when it was in the off position . Maybe there is more then 1 sporlan back there and I just have n't found it . <p> gcyeaw <p> 06-08-2010 , 06:46 PM <p> On my ' 83 there are three valves back there an one up front .

The one up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark105 <p> 06-08-2010 , 08:52 PM <p> What I found was when the Sporlan did n't close the fresh water fill would continue to fill the fresh water tank , to the point that it would overflowed with the Sporlan not working it would not allow the fresh water to enter the coach water system to fill the heater and piping . Therefore the water pump cycles . When the Sporlan is working correctly and the fill switch is off the water is then directed into the coach system and the water heater . Pressure builds up and things should work normally . <p> I can only relate to my situation . The water pump would not stop cycling and the fresh water tank would overflow . Once the Spartan was repaired , things worked like they should . <p> gcyeaw <p> 06-08-2010 , 08:59 PM <p> Something I discovered while rebuilding my tank fill valve was that the piston would sometimes stick in the on position .

I set it ( but it has never actually tripped ) to come on at a temp above 90 when a pet is left in the coach , so if park power fails the A/C will still run .

There 's NO smoke coming from the coach at the moment so it 's not running a lot of fuel and we 'll just take small steps . <p> We 're unsure if dropping the 30 gal muffler is even worth it .

It was at night and I did not want to stay up to wait for the juice to come back on . So , I flipped the breaker on the pedestal to off , set auto start to low voltage , and went back to bed . Couple of hours later , the genny started , ran for an hour or so .

I set it ( but it has never actually tripped ) to come on at a temp above 90 when a pet is left in the coach , so if park power fails the A/C will still run . The thermostat that trips it is in the direct path of an A/C vent , so there is no way the temp would get that high without a power failure . <p> peteaeonix <p> 03-17-2014 , 03:38 PM <p> The key is the transfer switch . It is supposed to draw from the generator ( if present ) , then from shore power ( if present ) , then from the inverters ( if on ) last . <p> My ' 95 would start and run the generator ( as normal ) while still attached to shore power , though I rarely ever did that .

If I start the generator while connected to shore power the breakers that feed my inverter trip . Ca n't figure it out , so I just do n't do it that way anymore . <p> I start our M380 's genset often while connected to shore power without any negative results .

@@61178209 @1178209/ <p> I 'm not sure this is the best place to start this thread , but if not please move it to the right location . I am seeking advise on satellite tv . I have a TracStar in motion system with a Direct TV DVR . The TracStar is the one BB installed in 2003/4 when they built the Coach . Sometimes the system works great , but more often than not I loose the signal or the signal strength is not great and when I try to reboot the DVR more often than not it wo n't pick up the signal . I get the Sat , but the numbers are low or sporatic . I end up calling Direct TV and they always tell me the same thing about disconnecting the power , or the Sat in cable or the reset button etc . The system will work great for days then I have the above described problem without moving the Coach - no trees or anything to block the signal . More and more I am seeing Coaches with large dishes and no dome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals ? I do n't care about the in motion use , but do care about getting service when I am stopped - at least my wife does ! Since my system is some 7 years old is the technology outdated ? Your thoughts , comments and knowledge is appreciated . Thanks <p> Ernest Ekberg <p> 12-25-2010 , 08:04 PM <p> Dennis , I love my Trac star so much , I gave it away . I 'm done with the dome thing .

Going on 9 years now and have had NO problems with it . It can be used with DirecTV , DishNetwork or the Canadian sat system . I have been satisfied since day one . DirecTV is great also . They allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And turn it on when we take a trip . Have always had a signal virtually anywhere we have traveled from coast to coast . New england to Florida , Rocky Mountains , desert sothwest , everywhere . <p> I was impressed and bought the system he acquired . I have n't intalled it yet . About 1/3 the costs of the " in motion " KVH type systems . <p> Dan &amp; Cindy <p> 12-25-2010 , 08:27 PM <p> Dennis , check the coaxial cable connectors between the dish and receivers . <p> I bet that I have the same setup as you . On occasion , I 've had to call Direct TV to send a refresh signal and reboot the receivers . This has always worked until earlier this year during our trip to the Albuquerque Balloon Festival . Everything was working while we were in motion and then it lost the signal while doing a 180 degree turn after a fuel stop . <p> Multiple refresh signals and reboots did n't help . Both receivers did not have any signal on the first two transponders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that was the problem and was expecting a dead dish . However , they were right , I had a loose connection feeding the front receiver . Retightened it and everything is good again . <p> DonB <p> 12-25-2010 , 09:00 PM <p> More and more I am seeing Coaches with large dishes and no dome . Are these new dishes better at picking up the Sat signals ? Satellite signals are definitely proportional to dish size , and domes have small dishes . The primary reason you are seeing the proliferation of large dishes , though , is that it is the only way to get HD with DirecTV . No dome has been made ( or is likely to be made ) that can get HD with DirecTV . <p> For you Dish users , note that I fully qualified the above statements . <p> Dennis <p> 12-25-2010 , 10:53 PM <p> Thanks guys this is helpful information . I am using a Direct TV DVR yet I do not record anything . Other posts on WOG have commented that DVR drives do not like motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-DVR receiver ? <p> Dan I notice you said you called KVH - do you have a KVH system or a TracStar system ? Two days ago my system worked great for a week - have n't moved the Coach either . The cable is is fine as far as the back of the receiver . <p> Is KVH suppose to be a better system than TracStar ? <p> Thanks <p> DonB <p> 12-25-2010 , 11:11 PM <p> While all disc drives are better at shock-absorption than they used to be , they do n't put notebook drives in DVRs because they expect them to be motionless . No problem if you disconnect power before traveling . <p> I still have the original Hughes DirecTV receivers M/N GCEB0 . What do you see when you use the setup menu to get to the transponder test screen ? If you see a bunch of zeros especially for transponders 1 &amp; 2 , you need to verify there is nothing obstructing the view of the dish including wet leaves on the dome . The manual describes system testing on pages 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 01:37 AM <p> Dennis , We have a Tracstar SV360 that had problems like you describe . I had the benifit of the direct TV installer advising me , we checked the cable it was fine .

Then moved the cable to the un-used jack of the daul LNB &amp; presto ! , it worked we had signal strength in the seventies or eighties . This only lasted for about three months and lost signal again . I called Tracstar tech in Orlando ( 407-650-9054 ) and found they have a new and improved daul-LNB , ordered &amp; installed , everything has been working fine for the last year and half . We have been happy with the in-motion dome , it has worked fine in the northwest , southwest , and southeast .

They have always used " satellite tables " to identify key signals on the satellites , both the ones that are the destination , and others the dish might encounter before hitting the correct one . The satellite providers frequently change their signals , making satellites unidentifiable until the table gets updated . <p> Motosat internet controllers for many generations have had externally-loaded tables , and there are two of us who know how to identify satellites and routinely publish new tables . RF Mogul internet products can also load new tables , but none of us have the ability to create one . Their TV products have always had the tables inside the proprietary firmware , so no chance of anyone but them producing changes as needed . <p> As I noted , the mechanism by which the Winegard products work is unknown , which originally made me unwilling to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience that says they just work without updates , however it is that they do it . <p> Updates are not necessarily frequent , with the last one prior to the 3/29 one being in August of 2015 . <p> yesmar <p> 04-10-2016 , 05:49 PM <p> Thanks for the information . You have given me food for thought . <p> I have had the Travler on my 2000 LXI and on my 5th wheel ( both sold ) and it worked flawlessly . I can get a Travler for about $800.00 cheaper than the RFMongul , so I may forget about the ease of changing between Dish and Direct . <p> Thanks for the in depth information <p> HummerH1 <p> 04-11-2016 , 12:11 PM <p> The Trac Star software upgrade costs $35.00 + Shipping .

How could you have known I found another problem bird ? <p> John , <p> Sorry If I was abrupt , I was in a hurry headed out the door , coolant in the oil is a very bad thing regardless of the source , probably more serious than the water pump . We all want to help . Keep asking you will eventually find a good Bird . <p> sfedeli <p> 06-13-2012 , 04:57 AM <p> So , is it possible that a bad water pump could put coolant into oil on 8V92 ? I have NEVER heard of this ? : confused : <p> Yes , it is possible . The weep hole is designed to allow pressurized coolant a means of escaping the bearing assembly in the pump . If that hole was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward , toward the " other " side of the shaft- where the gear-driven wheel is on the water pump . That gear is oiled from the engine 's oil supply . It is a highly unlikely scenario , but given the shoddy quality of most newer rebuilt components ( like Mexican water pumps ) , I guess it 's something to consider . <p> 442john <p> 06-13-2012 , 06:28 AM <p> It was a mechanic I talked with , but one the owner had look at problem , and , yes , you guessed right , it is the one in Florida . The owner went back up to $49,500:eek : in his add ! ( not that I could afford $50,000 LOL ) I called him and asked if he fixed problem and he said he thought so , his mechanic said is was water pump and put new one on . i had never heard of such , thus the question .

Would n't seem to matter much HOW the coolant got into the oil at this point . How the price has gone up makes absolutely no sense other then the fellow was going to dump the coach at 29 due to the known problems . Apparently the " fix " makes the coach more valuable in his eyes . <p> Now the question is has damage been done . I would suspect it has . <p> Rick <p> 06-13-2012 , 09:03 AM <p> I for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has be run at least twice with coolant in the oil . There is no way I would buy this coach without a road trip to ensure the coolant issue is repaired and then would want concessions for the possible damage done . <p> Is n't the owner a WOG member ? He should be able to fill us in . <p> 442john <p> 06-13-2012 , 04:53 PM <p> I was just looking into this coach and was VERY SHOCKED when the price went back up to $49,500 , which , as I said is way out of my price range . I could n't understand how he had fixed the problem so fast , so I called and he said he was " sick of all the bottom feeders and had a mechanic look at it and put a water pump on it and that fixed the problem " ( I recon I was on of those " bottom feeders " kind of hurt my feeling:D ) . Thus , I asked the experts , you all about it . I like the coaches on Randy 's sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a straight shooter , but ? I like square headlights , I know that is stupid but ? , also like a dinette , but ? Anyway , thanks for being so kind and helpfull , maybe I wo n't be a wannabee to long ? <p> Harrison <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:55 PM <p> The only way a water pump could leak coolant into the engine is if the weep hole was plugged ( Not very likely someone plugged it ) . Ask any diesel mechanic what glycol does to bearings . Here is a good article LONG ... I have owned a lot of 60 series Detroits and have seen about every problem you can have . <p> Spike45 <p> 06-18-2012 , 01:09 AM <p> Well , tell me that a bad water pump ON 8v92 put antifreeze into oil ? That is what a mechanic said , but I have NEVER HEARD OF IT ? : confused : <p> While water pumps have weep holes to prevent this . Plugging of the weep hole will cause coolant to push past the shaft drive seal . The seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the pump shaft . If the weep hole is solidly plugged the coolant pressure can push coolant into the lube oil . <p> Did you actually find the weep hole plugged or still looking for causes to investigate ? <p> Spike45 Gary Spires Retired Cummins ( Fleetguard ) Field Engineer <p> 442john <p> 06-18-2012 , 08:37 AM <p> No I did n't find anything , I was just going by what the present owner said . I have n't seen the coach , it is the one in Florida that had a " small amount of coolant in oil " then , all the suden , price jumped $20,000 and owner said that a mechanic put new water pump on and mechanic said that would fix problem . <p> Ernest Ekberg <p> 06-18-2012 , 08:54 AM <p> You can add square headlites and a dinette <p> Spike45 <p> 06-18-2012 , 10:13 AM <p> No I did n't find anything , I was just going by what the present owner said .

Free coolant is rarely found in the oil as the crankcase oil temperatures are above the boiling point of a typical premixed coolant . Oil analysis would show high levels of sodium and potassium which are strong indicators of coolant ( coolant additives ) in the oil . Other causes of coolant in the oil can be oil cooler leakage , head gasket leakage , air compressor . It is not common to see a plugged water pump weep hole in an on-highway vehicle . More common in construction engines . <p> If the price jumped $20K that must have been a platinum water pump ! Which engine model is it ? 
@@61178215 @1178215/ <p> I did not run genny . Lower radiator hose has leak . We discovered it after opening the genny tray to show me the motor . I did not want to risk running it hot .

If you 've found the level to be satisfactory , then it 's time to check the gen cooling fan to see if it 's working . When you start you generator , do you see that the cooling fan is starting and staying running ? Mine did similar to yours on the trip home . It would run for a few minutes , then shut off . Turns out the switch for the fan is mounted on the side of the generator box and got " bumped " off going down the road . Maybe running over that Yugo did more than I thought ! It only did it once and has run perfectly since . Good luck with yours ! <p> jwasnewski <p> 07-29-2008 , 06:26 PM <p> Next time you start the genset look at the genny gauges for water temp and oil pressure . The system has an over temp sensor that will close the fuel solenoid in over temp conditions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the problem . Sounds like and air lock problem as Randy suggested or the cooling fan is not working . If you have a PowerTech , on the water jacket near the thermostat there should be two sensors/senders . One is for the gauge and one is for the over temp shut down system . If you ground the over temp sensor wire the genny should shut down . At least that is how mine works . As fixed wing stated that cooling fan is 220v and should be running when the genny is started . <p> joe40king <p> 07-29-2008 , 07:57 PM <p> Gentlmen The water temp looked fine on guage but the oil pressure was bouncing off the high end of guage . I did not stay outside to confirm fan was still running but will do that tomorrow I saw a petcock on top to the inside of radiator cap and opened then shut it prior to starting .

Remove the radiator cap . Our Onan has a remote rad , sometimes squeezing or milking the input and output hoses alternately will help . Lastly loosen the radiator hose clamps , the air may escape . You could have other problems such as a blocked radiator of a bad water pump .

To repeat someone else 's comment , be careful , that 's 190 degree plus water/coolant mix and it will burn you bad . <p> One tip I think worth passing on is that I used band type hose clamps . There a couple of bucks more expensive , but the peace-of-mind is worth it to me . Matter of fact I 've gone through the coach and replaced as many of the screw type hose clamps as I can get at .

Free coolant is rarely found in the oil as the crankcase oil temperatures are above the boiling point of a typical premixed coolant . Oil analysis would show high levels of sodium and potassium which are strong indicators of coolant ( coolant additives ) in the oil . Other causes of coolant in the oil can be oil cooler leakage , head gasket leakage , air compressor . It is not common to see a plugged water pump weep hole in an on-highway vehicle . More common in construction engines . <p> If the price jumped $20K that must have been a platinum water pump ! Which engine model is it ?

@@61178245 @1178245/ <p> Has anyone tied the generator cooling system in with the main engine via heater hoses ? I was thinking of doing this with my coach , possibly a couple of ball valves to shut it off if desired ? my thoughts were it would make the whole coach essentially have one cooling system that all worked together . In the heat the genny would help the main engine keep cool and in the cold the gen would help keep the main engine warm ( especially when parked not running ) visa versa . For electric fans it would also make the genny fan run less in average temps with the main engine rad doing most of the cooling . On my coach this will be a very simple thing to try . My genny rad is right up front with a grill and the fan runs directly off the engine , no electrics . Should help my engine temps in the hills . Any thoughts ? <p> I have seen this done , on Birds and converted coachs . Seemed to work fine .

@@61178257 @1178257/ <p> Has anyone tied the generator cooling system in with the main engine via heater hoses ? I was thinking of doing this with my coach , possibly a couple of ball valves to shut it off if desired ? my thoughts were it would make the whole coach essentially have one cooling system that all worked together . In the heat the genny would help the main engine keep cool and in the cold the gen would help keep the main engine warm ( especially when parked not running ) visa versa . For electric fans it would also make the genny fan run less in average temps with the main engine rad doing most of the cooling . On my coach this will be a very simple thing to try . My genny rad is right up front with a grill and the fan runs directly off the engine , no electrics . Should help my engine temps in the hills . Any thoughts ? <p> I have seen this done , on Birds and converted coachs . Seemed to work fine .

I had my buddy CowDoc on the ladder pouring into the tub and I was on the ground filling the smaller bucket from my 5 gallon cans . Did n't have to syphon . Had one leak which I was able to fix easily . My leaks came from some compromises I made when I did the hose replacements a couple years back .

@@61178302 @1178302/ <p> Cummins C8.3 engine in BMC 37 ' . There are four filters you should be concerned about . <p> LF3000 - Lube filter which is your engine oil filter . Make sure you fill it with oil when replacing it . There are 2 gaskets -- both should be lubricated with oil . <p> Fuel/Water Separator which in essence is your primary fuel filter . It 's the one that 's easy to get to and is the larger of the two fuel filters . It is at the right rear of the coach mounted on the frame rail . It has a drain on the bottom which you can open to drain out any accumulated water . Fill with fuel and lube the gasket with oil before replacing it . There are several options for this filter : <p> The FS1242 and NAPA 533242 are designed for use with a clear plastic bowl at the bottom . The FS1212 is designed without the clear plastic bowl . IE : If your coach has the clear plastic bowl at the bottom you will need FS1242 , or NAPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic bowl you will need part number FS1212 . I loaded pics of the two filters in the photo section . http : //tinyurl.com/2rguk5 <p> FS1251 - This is the smaller of the two fuel filters . It is located high up on the passenger side of the engine and is a real ***** to get to . The " special tool " used to get to it is called a long , greasy arm . Be ready to jump in the shower whenever you finish replacing this one . Like the other fuel filter , fill with fuel and lube the gasket with oil before replacing it . <p> WF2070 or 2071 - This is your coolant service filter which should be replaced at every oil change interval . The C8.3 engine is a " wet liner " engine . Normal piston slap causes the cylinder liner to vibrate at a high frequency . Vapor bubbles are created in the coolant as the liner moves away from the coolant ( called " cavitation " ) . The bubbles collapse as the liner moves back into the coolant . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to pitting ( not good ) . <p> The coolant " filter " adds a Supplemental Coolant Additive ( SCA ) to your antifreeze and forms an oxide film on the liner surface . The bubbles still form ; however , they remove the oxide film rather than working on the liner surface . This is why the SCA level depletes and must be replenished . The SCA level should be tested to maintain a SCA between 1.2 and 3.0 . If it is below 1.2 , you should add liquid SCA to raise the level to 1.5 and replace the filter . If it is above 3.0 , do not replace the filter until it drops to 3.0 . Test kits are available for this purpose . Remember to take the coolant sample from the radiator drain cock -- not from the overflow bottle or top of the tank . <p> Info below is from other sites on the net . Verify all info below before " counting on it " as it is generic to other brand coaches . <p> 5 . Transmission Service- Allison MD3060 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Transynd , capacity approximately 26 qts , first service at 5k miles , every 25k miles thereafter or 18k miles for Dexron . <p> 6 . Air System- air dryer-Haldex ( Midland ) Pur Air Plus , have the coalescent and desiccant filter checked for contaminants every time oil changed , use service kit DQ6026 or obtain filters individually . check tanks if water is present change filter , it 's likely contaminated , filter F950011 . Monthly for auto moisture ejectors , remove moisture in the air reservoirs by opening the petcocks or valves ( some now have lanyards attached to valves or you can order from Spartan for the 3 tanks ) <p> 9 . Cooling System- drain and flush every 2 years , 50/50 mix of water and low silicate antifreeze. diesel coolant additive-1.5 to 3.0 units per gallon , change coolant filter at oil change for all engines <p> 10 .

Trying to get smart ( not much chance of that : o ) before picking up our 95 BMC next month . <p> Lee Davis <p> 12-19-2013 , 09:05 AM <p> A couple of other comments . <p> A guy at the recent Cummins rally in Indiana said he had a friend using Fleetguard filters and one had a problem and messed up his engine . Since Fleetguard is a Cummins product , they fixed his engine no charge . He said if it had been anyone else 's filter they would not have covered it . Sometimes they are a little more expensive , but after that story it sounded like cheap insurance . <p> Also if you want an easier time when it comes to coolant there is another approach you can do . If you use ES Compleat ( another Cummins product , which is slightly more expensive but not much ) it is a " lifetime coolant " <p> Cummins says you need to change the coolant filters at the right intervals , but never need to change coolant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ( a little expensive , as I recall about $75 each ) . So now I just watch the coolant level and change the filter every two years . You can buy blank filters if you want ( no chemicals ) and add your own when needed , but it 's hard to buy just a few test strips at a time , they , at least for me , are a little hard to read , so I check the chemicals occasionally with them but go with the filters with the chemicals in them <p> The Cummins folks are very high on the filters with the synthetic rather than the ones with the paper filtering medium . <p> Lee Davis <p> 12-19-2013 , 09:10 AM <p> I looked at my filter file and noticed a few differences form Dan 's post <p> Appreciate the info Dan .

Darned if I can find a conversion chart somewhere . <p> Rick <p> 09-19-2009 , 12:10 AM <p> Glen , Welcome to the site . These guys know it all or at least all that 's worth knowing . You may have a tough time converting 900 x 20 to metric . I 'm not aware of anything you can just mount . Hope you do n't have to change the entire wheel assemble to get to the metric size . <p> k1100lt <p> 09-19-2009 , 12:30 AM <p> Thanks , Rick . If not , where would you suggest I look for a direct replacement . What is the correct sizing ? Just 900x20 ? Regards , Glenn . <p> iamflagman <p> 09-19-2009 , 04:48 AM <p> Thanks , Rick .

I replaced a set on my old bus conversion with 11R22.5 tires and wheels , just make sure that you have the proper wheels to use the 11R 's on , check out ; <p> Sounds like you still have the split rims. 9.00x20 are impossible to find . 10x20 are fairly easy . Goodyear is the only maker of this tire domestically that i know of . You can find chinese knock offs in some outlets if you look hard enough however some folks will argue the reliability.I have a pair on each side of my duallys and they seem ok , but I 'm very diligent and anal about my tires . Bear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make very sure your rims are rust free on the inside as the lips rust and than the split rim will seat poorly and become a hazard . My advice is to chuck the split rims and go with modern steel 1 piece . If you must travel with the present tires make dam sure there is no weather checking or case splitting on the sidewall carcass . a blow out with split rims is catastrophic--- : ) <p> If you have any questions on your bus about what things should look like I can send you pics or descriptions as mine is only 2 years newer and pretty darn unmolested <p> One other thing , the speed rating of these rims and tires ( yes there is a speed rating ) is 65 mph . However with the old ford powerplant you will not have to worry about that very much ( unless you point it downhill with a 50 mph wind behind you ) : eek : 188183 @qwx598183 <p> 09-19-2009 , 07:57 AM <p> get rid of those widow maker rims asap. most tire shop guys have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerous.plus , they require tubes , they are not tubeless , try getting one of those fixed on the side of the road . <p> hturner 12 <p> 09-19-2009 , 08:23 AM <p> When I had my class CI had a hard time finding 8.50x 16 .

If they fly off every thing and one can become a target <p> bwinter1946 <p> 09-19-2009 , 01:03 PM <p> Not sure if it applies here but I know back in the day some rims were de-rated if you installed radial tires . Some of the old rims were not built to with stand the added stress that radial tires can exert . If memory serves the steel " radial " style rims had an " R " inside a circle on the inside of the rim . This was on gas SOB coaches so I do not know if this applies here . Perhaps some one that knows for sure will chime in . <p> Rick <p> 09-19-2009 , 02:26 PM <p> Did anyone ever manufacture a 20 inch radial tire ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever manufacture a 20 inch radial tire ? <p> Rick , <p> I put a link in my reply ( message #4 ) on this thread ; <p> Glenn , <p> Good Year list a 900R20F on their web site although it is listed for use on Steer And Free-Rolling Wheel Positions ; LONG ...

I still remember my boss screaming about the price . In those days we were having a blowout a week on this 10 wheel truck ( bias ply tires ) . we did n't  have a blowout for 5 years with those mich. tires. just the tire repair bill paid for those radials in 5 years ! <p> Rick <p> 09-19-2009 , 05:13 PM <p> Another question answered . See Glenn they do know everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g149 is what I have on mine for steer tires . Again i still have split rims . But i am very keen on tire pressures and I have inspected my rims and splits very closely . Make sure you use new liners as well .

@@61178359 @1178359/ <p> Now that I have gotten my feet wet , actually I have been dunked in the M380 , there are several items that I would like to check with the group about . <p> 1 . It appears that if you have the domestic hot water switch " on " at the Hurricane unit , the circulating pump will run 24/7 whether hot water is required or not . True ? ? If so has anyone installed a switch inside to turn it off when not needed for dry camping ? <p> 2 . Have you folks checked the rubber boots on your front ball joints for splits and general deterioration ? I have looked at two , mine being one of them . The first one had bad boots on all four ball joints while the one I purchased has two bad boots on the bottom joints ( top still look good ) . If you have n't looked at yours recently , please check , we all may have a problem along possibly with the 450 coaches also . A fellow from Canada asked about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Is anyone still using the Kenwood GPS system . If so do you know where to get current maps ? <p> I am sure I will have many more questions and hope I can contribute after I have more time with the new ( to me ) Bird . <p> Thanks for your help . <p> marvjeanm380 <p> 02-24-2011 , 10:43 PM <p> Hello Jim : <p> I have had my M380 since 2003 and am still learning . <p> Yes , if you turn the hot water switch on the Hurricane unit in the bay the pump will run 24/7 . Annoying ! ! ! . So , I remoted a switch on the dash so I could cut it on and off between uses without having to go outside . I got my switch from Blue Bird and simply extended the wires from the present switch to the dash . You can probably find a switch from Parliment or Holland that is marked as Hydronic Heat . It does n't take rocket science to make the change . <p> I have not checked the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tip . <p> I am still using the Kenwood GPS unit . I updated the maps when I had to buy a new CD-ROM unit for the GPS . The last maps that were made by Kennwood are something like 2005 vintage . They were , at that time , more expensive than some of the more modern GPS units . If this unit gives up the ghost again I am going to replace it with one of the new units that offers free map updates . <p> I hope this helps . I am sure you will enjoy your M380 . You will find that if something do n't work to check and make sure that you are doing everything according to the way the coach likes because if you do n't it wo n't work . The computers have a mind of their own . <p> Take care , <p> Gman <p> 02-25-2011 , 11:23 AM <p> **28;567;TOOLONG 3 . Is anyone still using the Kenwood GPS system . If so do you know where to get current maps ? <p> Thanks for your help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my coach too and found that while a new DVD with updated maps is available , it costs more than a new GPS unit . I am sure all of the newer units by Magellan , Garmin and TomTom are much , much better than the older Kenwood . For about $125.00 you can get a TomTom with updatable maps and several features that make for a good bus unit . The volume of the unit is based on your speed , the faster you go , the louder it gets . It shows both your speed and the Posted Speed Limit ! A whole bunch of other features as well . Particularly anoying in the Kenwood dash unit is its mutting of the dash radio each time the unit gives spoken directions . Stupid comments by the GPS chick like " stay on the selected route " always come during a time that prevents you from hearing what you wanted to hear on the radio ! <p> There are many great mounts available on the internet that will make any brand unit easy to reach and use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reply 's on the Kenwood GPS .

This system is a duplicate of the OEM system using a much smaller SS muffler , Benson said it was bolt in , with no modification . A&amp;W is a major supplier to Peterbuilt . <p> I 'm wondering about the new exhaust systems people are installing on these cosches . Are you re-installing the drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine , like the original muffler did ? Could this be a factor in the head gaskets blowing ? Do the new mufflers have something to stop the water back flowing into the engine ? Maybe a baffle or something ? Just asking <p> I guess I need to clarify my post . When I asked about water getting into the engine . When they first started making the M380 , water was going down the exhaust and getting into #1 cylinder and apparently locking up the engines or blowing the head gasket , as I understand . The series 60 engine , the big coach with the top exhaust , has enough UMPH to blow the water out . The Cummins does not . And that is why I am questioning these new systems . Are you putting the old drain system back in it or is there a baffle in the muffler to keep it from going down into the engine ? Because even with the 90 degree bend in the top exhaust a certain amount of water might still be able to get into the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to consider . This new ceramic coated system looks good but have they taken all these items into consideration ? Again , just asking ... <p> Doc , on all of our Kenworth 's we would drill a 1/4 ' hole on the underside of the lowest part of the " Y " pipe . This let any rain water out and prevented the pipe from rusting prematurely . Strangely enough the hole did not leak exhaust ? That is for someone smarter than me to figure out , but that being said I plan to drill a hole in my new M380 exhaust for just that purpose <p> Doc , I 've seen some WOG posts with various schemes to trap and drain water on the M380 pipe . When I removed the old exhaust on our coach the drain line was plugged off and there was 1-2 pints of water that was sitting in the muffler . While the original drain line was a good idea , it appears there was enough scale and crude in the exhaust system , that they quit functioning at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style cap on the exhaust outlet instead of the pretty chrome elbow . I know someone else has done that and I 've considered it but have n't installed one yet . <p> I am not aware of any of the 380 's with revised mufflers having head gasket problems . Not that the mufflers have solved that issue , just that the head gasket issue happened before the muffler change or they have n't had an issue .

@@61178388 @1178388/ <p> M380 ( Unique Issues ) If you have a where you can list it ..... list your M380 Parts here too . <p> I spoke with Marshall Waters at A&amp;W Productions in Sanger , TX yesterday and he is going to build a few more 380 systems next week , call him if you 're interested , this is a complete unit from engine to chrome tip , all ceramic coated . 940-458-7512 This is a pic of the kit he made for Steve Benson , using his pipe for the pattern . <p> Chuck if you look around the site the installed pics should be there . This system is a duplicate of the OEM system using a much smaller SS muffler , Benson said it was bolt in , with no modification . A&amp;W is a major supplier to Peterbuilt . <p> I 'm wondering about the new exhaust systems people are installing on these cosches . Are you re-installing the drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine , like the original muffler did ? Could this be a factor in the head gaskets blowing ? Do the new mufflers have something to stop the water back flowing into the engine ? Maybe a baffle or something ? Just asking <p> I guess I need to clarify my post . When I asked about water getting into the engine . When they first started making the M380 , water was going down the exhaust and getting into #1 cylinder and apparently locking up the engines or blowing the head gasket , as I understand . The series 60 engine , the big coach with the top exhaust , has enough UMPH to blow the water out . The Cummins does not . And that is why I am questioning these new systems . Are you putting the old drain system back in it or is there a baffle in the muffler to keep it from going down into the engine ? Because even with the 90 degree bend in the top exhaust a certain amount of water might still be able to get into the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to consider . This new ceramic coated system looks good but have they taken all these items into consideration ? Again , just asking ... <p> Doc , on all of our Kenworth 's we would drill a 1/4 ' hole on the underside of the lowest part of the " Y " pipe . This let any rain water out and prevented the pipe from rusting prematurely . Strangely enough the hole did not leak exhaust ? That is for someone smarter than me to figure out , but that being said I plan to drill a hole in my new M380 exhaust for just that purpose <p> Doc , I 've seen some WOG posts with various schemes to trap and drain water on the M380 pipe . When I removed the old exhaust on our coach the drain line was plugged off and there was 1-2 pints of water that was sitting in the muffler . While the original drain line was a good idea , it appears there was enough scale and crude in the exhaust system , that they quit functioning at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style cap on the exhaust outlet instead of the pretty chrome elbow . I know someone else has done that and I 've considered it but have n't installed one yet . <p> I am not aware of any of the 380 's with revised mufflers having head gasket problems . Not that the mufflers have solved that issue , just that the head gasket issue happened before the muffler change or they have n't had an issue .

@@61178422 @1178422/ <p> I had the bird up to a tire place a week ago to repair a leaking valve stem and install crossfires . In the process , the outside rear drivers side wheel was removed , and the tire was broken down and then reassembled . By Monday I realized there was a slow leak on that outside rear tire , around the bead this time , confirmed with soapy water . Nothing else leaking that I could see . It had dropped a couple pounds by tuesday from 95 to 90 . I went out to check on it tonight and the tire is completely flat on the ground , and the bead is off the wheel so no way to air it up for the drive to the tire place . I did call the tire place on Monday and told them soonest I can drive up is Friday and they were very apologetic and said they would do it right away . Now I wonder if I should try to take it off and drive up there with one rear tire ( 30 miles or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile repair unit . I had n't ever had leaking tires around the bead before but that does n't necessarily make it their fault/their problem ... not sure what the charge might be to drive down here to deal with it . I think there is a jack and some tools but to be honest it 's not something I spent much time looking for since I have n't thought I would be the right guy to be jacking up a bus and changing tires . I 'm not afraid of car tires but this is new territory . So ... what to do ? They open at 7am and I 'll be on the phone but not sure if I should be requesting they hustle down to fix it or ? ? ? What would Randy do ? Or Bill ? Or the rest of you ? Thanks , Bob <p> I have great respect for your experience after spending the winter reading on the WOG . Thank you for the quick and definitive response . I will request that the tire guys come and visit the FC tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As an aside , I walked in grumbling about the tire and my wife suddenly got worried and said this is a huge problem . I picked up the laptop and said " watch this " and posted this story here on the WOG . No surprises , the bird family already flocked to the rescue . She will rest easier now . <p> Yeah best to get the service truck . Then you do n't have to risk any damage towing it . The proper lug nut torque is around 500 ft lbs , and unless you have a torque multiplier or a lot of ballast you wo n't get them to spec . Good luck I hope all goes well . <p> The service truck arrived before 9 and a little over an hour later we are back in business . They claim it was likely their fault so no charge . We sanded off a bit of corrosion inside the bead on the aluminum wheel and that did the trick . The kid they sent worked hard in a cold north wind and got it fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . Thanks guys for the help ! <p> And now the tire is leaking again ... around the bead again . Will keep it aired up over the weekend ( tire place closed sat and sun ) and drive up to the tire place on Monday for another look . Got ta be a little corrosion on the inside of the wheel , I would think . The guy did " spin " the tire about a quarter turn to the right today when the air was all out of it . The air seeping out the bead is about a quarter turn to the right from where it was previously . Coincidence or maybe the tire itself has a bad spot ? Who knows .

@@61178428 @1178428/ <p> M380 ( Unique Issues ) If you have a where you can list it ..... list your M380 Parts here too . <p> As described here and here , I 've been operating my rear slide with an 8-relay replacement for the factory PLCs . It worked fine , but I 've continued to play with it , primarily to get a working 10-second delay setup for the air seal . <p> I tried several different cheap 12-volt timers , but they all failed after just a few uses . Finally I shelled out for a $34 Hella automotive timer-relay , and that has now been working through many cycles of operation . <p> Along with the timer issue , my 8-relay design used a manual switch for the seal deflation , and it was easy to leave it deflated without meaning to . It had no lock operation ( most agree that the lock is unnecessary , but a future owner might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not have a transmission lockout when the slide was n't in the travel position . <p> I 've replaced with a 16-relay version that functions exactly like the factory version . Press the in or out button and it will deflate , unlock ( if in-and-locked ) , then move after 10 seconds . The main difference now is that it is powered by the coach batteries instead of a converter/charger , and there is a swtch in the bedroom to turn off power to the mechanism via a solenoid . <p> Below is a picture of the completed assembly , which has been tested and retested repeatedly , and below that is the relay schematic . I would not claim that this is a simple project , but it shows that you can get away from the unreliable electronics originally used . <p> ... I would not claim that this is a simple project , but it shows that you can get away from the unreliable electronics originally used . <p> My rear slide problems last year were not caused by the electronics . While I admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to have excellent results since addressing my mechanical issues : <p> 1 ) replacing OEM converter with higher output but physically smaller unit 2 ) adding simple plug-in switch at the outlet on the bay roof to turn slide electronics &amp; converter OFF , when not in use 3 ) replacing OEM motor with new unit from original supplier in NJ 4 ) lubing jack screw and adjusting stops <p> I suspect the converter BB used was under powered so that left the motor to face self-induced brownouts each time it was used , and that is why my motor burned out . Secondly , turning the converter &amp; electronics OFF when not in use eliminates any self induced heat damage , and it resets the " software " each time the system is used . In my climate , heat rather than moisture is the big worry . Since your coach " lives " in a damp climate that might change things . However , rebooting the software each and every time also eliminates any glitches that may be induced with all the power transfers our coaches endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority in both directions and the deflate/inflate &amp; locking/unlocking solenoid are all working perfectly . <p> Van , I have no issues with what you 've done , but I do have some issues with your assumptions . <p> My measurements indicate around 10 amps total draw when the main motor is running , so there is no way the OEM 45-amp supply should be deficient . The biggest current problem is the wire gauge from the controller to the motor , which neither of us has addressed in our modifications . <p> There is , I believe , no " software reset " when powering down/up . We sometimes call these units computers , but they are logic controllers that have no boot-up process . Essentially they operate as though they were hard-wired like my relays , except the pathways between the relays in the PLCs can be altered by programming the logic circuits instead of having to physically move wires around . <p> The PLC problems fall into two categories : Total failure that ca n't be fixed , which happened to one of mine , and partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed by re-programming , and that happened to the other of mine . Presumably one problem cascaded to the other for them both to go at the same time . <p> Heat is certainly a big worry , and I agree that powering down the unit when not in use will reduce the heat problem . That was definitely not helped when Blue Bird left the paper wrap around the PLCs , when it is clearly marked as needing removal after installation to reduce heat problem . Everybody should check theirs and remove the paper if it is there . <p> Amen Don ! I replaced the whole bloody lashup with three switches and have never missed all that PLC junk . Your relay project is impressive and beyond my limited electrical skills . I remain thankful the front slide system is working reliably . Strange BB could n't have used duplicate systems front to back . Air piston would have been a better choice . <p> Woody and i were talking about the LX , LXI slideouts . They are hydraulically operated . They use the same pump as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's etc . <p> What we talked about was putting a separate pump ion for just the slide out rams . Do away with all the safety 's and all that . Have an inflate/deflate switch and a push button switch for the slide rams , with a limit switch on the out going and in coming side . Sounds easy to me.

I removed the jacks and took them to a hydraulic shop in Augusta Ga ( near where the coach was located when I bought it ) . The shop said they tried get parts and HWH would not sell them the parts . Both the jacks then had to be mailed to HWH in Ia in order for them to be fixed . I still have not received them back and the ordeal started 3 weeks ago . <p> One thing to remember if you do take them off ( I learned the hard way ) ...... If you do take them off , do n't attempt to operate other hydraulic items on the coach unless you cap off the open feed lines . I opened my generator slide and hydraulic fluid went everywhere due to the open lines and this will cause air to get into the system . Your 's may be different but wanted to share my learnings . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You do not have to get the parts from HWH . This has been posted over and over . Any good hydrolic shop can match the parts needed to reseal the Jacks .

Our problem wire is A-11 LOP on the inside of the box at the large round cannon plug connecter . With the control box mounted I beleave it is almost impossible to make this repair on the connector . This loose wire is in the start stop function . The pins and plugs of the cannon plug are hollow and require a pin extraction tool , the wires depending on which side of the plug are inserted into a plug or pin , both are hollow . If installed improperly the wire will back out or vibrate out and connection is lost . What I and most people with an Onan in an FC will tell you there is excessive vibration of the control box since it is mounted onto the generator . When you start or stop the generator it shakes excessively and I believe that is the root of most all problems with broken wire connections . So to eliminate the vibration of the control box I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casing for the control box to slide into . The casing box is mounted to the top of the generator compartment . When the generator started for us with the control box mounted in this casing there was no vibration of the control box but the generator shook like crazy . Tomorrow I will have new pins from Onan and a pin extraction tool from Grainger to reset new pins in the cannon plug . I will post pictures of the completed project in the next couple days . Here are a few pictures of the casing , its mounting location and the broken wire . I also noticed that the wires for the circuit breakers and the start switch were extremely short so I made up some jumper or extenstions to ease in the replacement of these switches for future repairs . Before I reset the pins we will use a jumper to test the generator start function on that wire , if it works we 'll replace a few more chaffed pins in the plug . <p> I want to add that the control box can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to use ratcheting box-end wrenches it is a little difficult but it can be done . <p> Rob Robinson <p> 05-30-2013 10:26 PM <p> John if you could tell us the specifics of the pins and extraction tool it might help others .

It worked fine , but I 've continued to play with it , primarily to get a working 10-second delay setup for the air seal . <p> I tried several different cheap 12-volt timers , but they all failed after just a few uses . Finally I shelled out for a $34 Hella automotive timer-relay , and that has now been working through many cycles of operation . <p> Along with the timer issue , my 8-relay design used a manual switch for the seal deflation , and it was easy to leave it deflated without meaning to .

Secondly , turning the converter &amp; electronics OFF when not in use eliminates any self induced heat damage , and it resets the " software " each time the system is used . In my climate , heat rather than moisture is the big worry . Since your coach " lives " in a damp climate that might change things .

The biggest current problem is the wire gauge from the controller to the motor , which neither of us has addressed in our modifications . <p> There is , I believe , no " software reset " when powering down/up . We sometimes call these units computers , but they are logic controllers that have no boot-up process . Essentially they operate as though they were hard-wired like my relays , except the pathways between the relays in the PLCs can be altered by programming the logic circuits instead of having to physically move wires around . <p> The PLC problems fall into two categories : Total failure that ca n't be fixed , which happened to one of mine , and partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed by re-programming , and that happened to the other of mine . Presumably one problem cascaded to the other for them both to go at the same time . <p> Heat is certainly a big worry , and I agree that powering down the unit when not in use will reduce the heat problem . That was definitely not helped when Blue Bird left the paper wrap around the PLCs , when it is clearly marked as needing removal after installation to reduce heat problem . Everybody should check theirs and remove the paper if it is there . <p> Amen Don ! I replaced the whole bloody lashup with three switches and have never missed all that PLC junk . Your relay project is impressive and beyond my limited electrical skills . I remain thankful the front slide system is working reliably .

I did attempt to start it and it started and ran again for an hour or so befor I shut it down . I attempted to start it from the control box and it would n't . I went back later this afternoon after it cooled down and it fired up and ran until I shut it down . It has to be in the start button circut for the control panel , we hope to find out Thursday and we 'll let you know what we found out . <p> birdsfirst <p> 05-30-2013 10:16 PM <p> 4 Attachment(s) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence , SC who works as a electrical maintenance tech for General Electric we think we have found the culprit . Our problem wire is A-11 LOP on the inside of the box at the large round cannon plug connecter . With the control box mounted I beleave it is almost impossible to make this repair on the connector . This loose wire is in the start stop function . The pins and plugs of the cannon plug are hollow and require a pin extraction tool , the wires depending on which side of the plug are inserted into a plug or pin , both are hollow . If installed improperly the wire will back out or vibrate out and connection is lost . What I and most people with an Onan in an FC will tell you there is excessive vibration of the control box since it is mounted onto the generator . When you start or stop the generator it shakes excessively and I believe that is the root of most all problems with broken wire connections . So to eliminate the vibration of the control box I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casing for the control box to slide into . The casing box is mounted to the top of the generator compartment . When the generator started for us with the control box mounted in this casing there was no vibration of the control box but the generator shook like crazy . Tomorrow I will have new pins from Onan and a pin extraction tool from Grainger to reset new pins in the cannon plug . I will post pictures of the completed project in the next couple days . Here are a few pictures of the casing , its mounting location and the broken wire . I also noticed that the wires for the circuit breakers and the start switch were extremely short so I made up some jumper or extenstions to ease in the replacement of these switches for future repairs . Before I reset the pins we will use a jumper to test the generator start function on that wire , if it works we 'll replace a few more chaffed pins in the plug . <p> I want to add that the control box can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to use ratcheting box-end wrenches it is a little difficult but it can be done . <p> Rob Robinson <p> 05-30-2013 10:26 PM <p> John if you could tell us the specifics of the pins and extraction tool it might help others . I imagine there is more than one pin type and therefore more than one extraction tool but maybe BB used your Cannon plug in several years of birds .

@@61178518 @1178518/ <p> You can view the modification that I did to my ' Bird , to add a heavier receiver type hitch , by going to LONG ... this is the first in a series of photos of the hitch modification , so to see more of them just click on NEXT at the right of each page to see the next one . <p> One of the things that I mention is the fact that when I added the receiver hitch assembly to the BOTTOM of the stock hitch , that it actually took away the dragging protection of the large rollers that came on the ' Bird . This especially became apparent after I switched to a 7 foot longer and heavier 27 foot 10,000 pound rated trailer that is loaded to 8,800 pounds , this added more tongue weight , enough so that I now load my VW inside the trailer backward , so that the VW 's engine is directly over the rear of the trailer and that helped to reduce the tongue weight . The tongue weight is n't enough to even notice the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did cause the receiver hitch to drag more often than before , so I added a Maxi Weld-on Steel Skid Roller LONG ... that I purchased from http : //www.tweetys.com/ <p> This addition has been very efficient in protecting the hitch as can be seen in this photo on my web site , that I added this morning <p> I mention all of this so that if anybody is thinking of doing this modification to their ' Bird , they might want to think about adding the receive hitch to the TOP of the stock hitch instead , if you are just going to be towing a toad and not a heavy trailer like I do . This modification was done in this fashion to my ' Bird so that it could be reinforced more effectively , due to the weight of the trailer that I planned on pulling . <p> You can see that the trailer does not effect the way that the ' Bird rides as far as being level and I DO NOT use an equalizer type hitch , or a sway control type hitch as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer to become a problem , the only difference in handling that I notice is , if I 'm not looking directly at my mirrors , I can tell by the slight movement in the steering wheel when a large semi is starting to pass the rear of the trailer , but it is n't enough movement to alarm me , it is just more noticeable than when the trailer is not hooked up to the ' Bird . <p> Since I normally pull the trailer , I have adjusted the tire pressure accordingly , about the only time I tow just the toad by itself is when I 'm taking the ' Bird to the Tour Bus Company shop for service and that is only a 70 mile round trip , so I never change the tire pressures . <p> I have also added a set of rollers to the back of my trailer , after we changed out the axles to spring type that are a little bit lowered , thus the back of the trailer comes in contact with the ground when going in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used on the trailer after driving from Florida to California with the new axles installed above and dragging the tail going in and out of some drives , they work great , i had them installed while I was still in California and purchased them direct from PAK Industries , they hand delivered them to me , while i was at my brothers visiting , they are great people to deal with ;

We both smoke the occasional cigar but will NEVER smoke inside our coach . <p> Either issue is a hard sell but the combination of them both makes it really difficult . <p> I thought seriously about this one and talked to the lady ( owner ? ) a while back .

So just knowing that ( and assuming there is lots more needed ) what 's it worth ?

@@61178613 @1178613/ 188181 @qwx598181 <p> I wanted to thank everyone for their spring replacement suggestions a week ago and return the favor by describing in a little more detail what I did to replace the front HWH springs on the two front jacks on my coach ( 1990 wb ) . <p> First I jacked up the coach by alternate lifting between the air suspension and jacks along with 10 by 10 timbers to get the front well off the ground . When I got everything high enough I supported the front frame with stacks of 10 by 10 's to get everything safe . <p> Based upon member 's advice I then removed the bolts retaining the jacks up inside the housings . These were real tough to loosen up and I actually used a car jack to apply pressure to the wrenches to get them started . I thought I would get enough room to get the new springs over the retaining " pins " but no , there was n't room to get them on ( these are the springs that do not have the eyebolt adjusters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and removing the jacks completely but instead I decided to remove the long steel " stabilizer " that extends from jack housing to jack housing . By removing bolts on both sides ( but leaving one side attached at just one point ) I was able to swing the steel down and gain enough access to hang the springs . <p> Taking the bolts off to remove that long piece of steel took a fair amount of fussing with just the right open end wrenches to get everything loose . A thin wall 33mm wrench I bought years ago for my Porsche was especially helpful . <p> After all that , everything went back together quickly and the springs were easily adjusted without shims because of the adjuster bolts on the other side of each jack . Do n't forget the Loctite on everything ! <p> Anyway , an interesting experiment . It might have been easier to disconnect the hydraulic lines to get access , but I wanted to avoid any contamination problems or bleeding scenarios on this older coach . <p> The whole job took about 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would probably take me about an hour to do it now , just FYI . <p> Anyway , thanks for everyone 's kind suggestions and I hope this helps someone else ! <p> Steve : too bad you did n't go the extra mile .

Once I took the cross member out , then undoing the sensor , and fluid line , I took the eight bolts out and it dropped down easy . Rebuilding the cylinder was very easy . Total cost was $60 for seals and loctite.

It probably uses the same inputs from the engine computer that the gage does . That might give some indication as to where the issue might be . I would think you would be getting a check engine alarm if the computer does not see oil pressure . <p> I am sure you would like to have an operating oil pressure gage , but there are other ways on these engines to check the pressure . <p> Thanks Jim .

@@61178648 @1178648/ <p> I wanted to watch the play-offs in HD via off-the-air digital broadcasts from the local stations , but the TV antenna lifter fails to raise the antenna on my 1985 PT40 . The motor makes " slipping clutch " noises when run in either the " raise " or " lower " modes . After removing the extension assembly , it was possible to use the motor to raise the stubs to allow access to the ( eighteen ! ! ) cover screws , each of which required an impact driver to loosen . <p> The lifter consists of a single assembly integrating motor and gear train . The only mark is a sticker " Warner Electric . " <p> There is a micro-switch positioned such that it probably was intended to open the circuit , stopping the motor when the antenna was completely retracted . However , the usual mode of operation during my ownership has been to raise or lower the antenna until slipping is heard . ( This is a " tock-tock-tock " sound . ) <p> Anyone have any experience with R/R on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TX <p> PS : I seem to be in one of those phases : on the last trip down from the roof , the plastic step-stool I 've been using for some time shattered to pieces . Had a good grip on the ladder , so no harm . Managed to short out the power leads for the co-pilot seat by pinching them in the swivel . Symptom was repeated tripping of a DC circuit breaker in the curb-side forward load center . Troubleshooting was unusual , as several wires of different colors were all numbered " 10 . " Last week discovered an inoperative slack adjuster on one side of the drive axle , which had existed for some time judging from the different wear on the brake shoes . Properly adjusted brakes work so much better ! And the previous week , the 50 A. receptacle on the coach shorted out ( at 1:08 A.M. , ) burning a hole through the case . Was able to get a reference number from Earl at BB , as the original manufacturer , Arrow-Hart , is gone . Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) These are U.L. approved , but not to current ( NEMA ? ) standards . In order to make the minimum order I also got the connector for the coach end of the cord . A local electric supply company in Seguin was able to get them overnight , but as usual there were issues . The receptacle did not include the strain relief/seal on the original--lucky that was n't melted so I could reuse mine . Secondly , although cataloged as the same steel plug as on my cord , the new plug ( Bryant 7764 ) is nylon , and about twice as long as the original . It will work , but the compartment door can not be closed and locked as before ...

@@61178651 @1178651/ <p> I found a leak in the generator when it quit running recently . The leak of cooling fluid is from a cast iron part which I believe is a thermostat like area , next to the alternator and behind the belts ( hope this makes sense and the pics show it better there is a black mark over the crack and a semiarrow pointing to it ) . I asume I need to change the piece out which I tried to remove today but could not get to the bolts . Is it possible to remove this area with without removeing the entire front areas ? <p> The housing that you unscrewed the mounting screws is the tstat housing . It 's aluminum and likely has n't cracked , it does have mating gaskets that may need replacing . You can remove the housing if you remove the coolant tank bracket bolts and pull the coolant tank towards the front of the coach . This should give you " just enough " clearance to remove the tstat housing .

Jerry McD , yes I would like to see your LX when you return . Jim , if the PT is still there , I 'd take a ride to see it . I 'm in Westfield , Lunenburg is n't that far to drive . Thanks , <p> Steve , I am still working full time and not quite ready to purchase yet . Even if a super deal came along , I would not have a place to park it at my current residence . Makes me wonder where " part timers " park their BB 's when not traveling.

You may eventually want to change the Facet fuel pump , they sometimes gradually loose there pumping pressure and eventually start to leak .

I 've checked the front wheel bearing oil level regularly ( couple of times a year ) -- like I said , I have a small ' seep ' from the left front that leaves some residue that collects dust around the edge of the hub cap . But that one the oil level is not low and ( within my ability to observe ) has not come down any . <p> I was actually very surprised that the right side was near-empty as there were no signs of a leak ( must be going out the back-side as someone suggested ) . <p> Since I 'm probably going to need a brake job ( linings ) sometime soon , I 'll have it attended to then . <p> I note that the hub that has not lost its oil appears newer than the other hub .

However I have a 700 mile trip ahead of me and a fairly free day today . I 'm assuming the hub must be removed to check the fluid ? If so , will a screwdriver just pry it off ? Anything else I need to know ? I 'm on Marathon so the chances of finding this oil are pretty good and I have my car . My phone is 22nine-938-oo68 . Thanks . <p> If I understand you correctly Stick , you should just be able to pop off the hubcap and you should see this : <p> That red rubber seal just pulls out ( and pushes back in ) . Be sure to check on flat ground ( no problem to find in FL ) and notice on the clear part of the Stemco axle end has a full line on it . Hope this helps you ...

I say this because the light by the preheat switch only comes on with the front unit on , and not with the back one .

You were correct that ( on my bus , at least ) the front Primus heats the hot water also . There is a manual valve on the bulkhead above the Primus boilers . With it shut off the front ( curb side ) the Primus only heats the hot water and not the coach . <p> The switch on the Primus control panel that looks like a water faucet must be depressed to the on position , which turns the thermostat control over to the temperature sensor in the water heater . <p> The Summer/Winter switch in the compartment above the driver 's area is supposed to be in the Summer position also ( although I admit I am not sure what this does ) . With all three of these switches/valves in this position the curb side Primus will only heat hot water and not the coach itself . <p> My regular hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Primus heats it up to 137 . This capability of propane water heating will come in very handy for dry camping , 30 amp campsites ( the 110v water heater uses as much power as a roof AC ) , or quicker recovery with multiple guests showering ( using both the Primus and the 110V heating elements ) . <p> Although my Primus has the buttons and LED 's for electrical boost elements ( the two lightning bolts ) , I assume that my bus does n't have this option as the amperage meters do n't show any increased electrical useage with these switched on . <p> Even so , this will be a great capability to use in many situations . Thanks for all the help and input .

@@61178833 @1178833/ <p> As I look at Bluebird Wonderlodge coaches , it appears to me that the M380 does not measure up as a true Bluebird . It appears to have a non Bluebird chassis and looks more like a regular run of the mill diesel pusher than a converted Bluebird bus . Given the change of owners and the economic problems the company faced , it appears to me that they put out the M380 at a cheaper production price to increase profits . Am I wrong ? The LX and the LXi appear to be true Bluebird conversions but the M380 was obviously different . Inferior , it would appear so . What do you think ? <p> The real question is does it matter ? Both chassis are more than capable of doing the job . Which one do you like better ? There are fulltimers in both coaches . Both are doing just fine . The 380 , being a little smaller sacrifices some room for maneuverability . But you can also get it into a WHOLE bunch more places than a 42/43/45 footer . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state parks and truly try to see the country in it , or park someplace and use your toad for day trips in the local area ? The former , you 'd be better off with the 380 . The latter , either will do the job . Do you plan on 100,000 miles a year ? Then chose the v92/S60 . Otherwise , pick the coach you like best . <p> John 96 WTOS 42 ' OKC USA ! <p> do n't waste your time with a usa-spec ipod adapter- poor products with poor support <p> Phil , I disagree that the M380 is an inferior Bluebird Wanderlodge . The M380 was engineered and manufactured by the same folks who had done the earlier Bluebirds . It has the same components , same level of craftsmanship , same quality and premium features of the earlier Birds . <p> Is it different ? You bet . The most notable difference is that it is skined with aluminum instead of steel . That innovation , combined with a Cummins ISL , gives the M380 one of the highest HP to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ArvinMeritor front and rear suspension gives the M380 arguably the best ride of all MH and performance that feels like a sports car . <p> When the M380 was released , it was intended to allow BB compete in a larger market where MSRP was around $400K , instead of the $1mm market where only a relatively small number of coaches were sold each year . Those first few M380 's like most other first production models did have some issues that were corrected , but nothing as severe as the M450 weight issues . <p> Phil you are entitled to have your own opinion and it is OK if it is different from mine cause I know that I am biased .

What I am looking at has two wires going to it and is plumbed in to the water lines for the Primus . <p> Andy , <p> Each Primus has it 's own pump . The pumps are located directly behind each Primus unit .

If you look at the back of the primus boiler , you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the heated water outlet from the boiler , now look directly down from that hose and you will see another hose . This is the inlet hose . Now trace that hose ( it heads toward the engine ) and about a foot behind the Primus boiler connected to that hose will be the motor . Sometimes the motor is quit enough you can not hear it operating over the boiler . You can put your hand on the motor housing and feel it running . The easiest way to know if the motor is operating is to remove the cap off the overflow tank ( there are two , one for each Primus ) and see of there is water flowing into the tank from the hose at the top of the tank . The tanks are mounted in the engine compartment to the ceiling of the engine compartment on the right side and to the left of the rear remote key panel .

These tanks should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe what you are are seeing ( above and infront of the boilers ) maybe the overheat sensors . These sensors have two wires ( forget the color , they may be red ) , and in the middle of the sensor there is a red reset button . If the water every gets overtemp or you run low on water and steam is produced , these sensors will open up and shut down the Primus . If that happens , you have to press the red-button to reset it ( they are kind of like circuit breakers , but based on temp instead of power ) . It 's either that or the spolan valve you are refering to . The spolan valve is controlled by a switch in the overhead cabinet above the pilots chair , and is marked summer/winter . When you flip it to summer , the spolan closes and allows the hot water from the boiler to only travel through the hot water heater to heat the hot water and keeps it from traveling through the coach and heating it up . <p> Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather talk , give me a call and I can go into additional detail on the Primus .

Dan Weaver replaced his but had to do some modifications in the process so i was n't sure if mine would be different if I decided to go that route . <p> There are 3 available for the 8.3 Cummins engine depending on how it hooks up to the turbo . There is the full marmon , half marmon , ( not sure what " marmon " means ) and an in line model . In doing research I called Spartan and found from my " build card " that they used a PacBrake kit which included the restrictor portion ( #10300-65 ) , the mounting group which is a flange ( #C11403 ) and the control group ( #C10210 ) <p> The new PXRB PacBrake to replace the restrictor portion is part # C40115 which is the in-line model .

For St. Patty 's day they have a 10% off sale , which makes the total $570 shipped . That is a great price for the PRXB . I had been wondering about the performance of my Pacbrake and yesterday I tried moving the shaft and it would n't budge . I took it off today and after 3 hours out in the shop I still could n't get it to budge . ( Kroil - PB Blaster - heat , etc. ) 3 of the 4 bolts that held the plate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ahead and do the upgrade now . At this point I doubt that the Pac had ever worked since I have owned the coach , and all I was getting was the Allison downshifting , much like what Dan Weaver experienced . <p> I 've read all the pacbrake threads and even called Pacbrake to verify the correct part # . I do n't remember the guys name at Pacbrake , but he looked up my ser # and told me I did need the C40115 . I got it in last week and went to replace it today . But , much to my dismay , it will not fit . The new pacbrake ( C40115 ) is a 4 " and my existing pacbrake is 5 " . Sure is frustrating trying to get the right part , especially when you find out on a Sunday that it wo n't work and will have to wait until tomorrow to call .

That valve releases the air pressure from the actuator when the Pac Brake is turned off . It can be seen where the air line is attached to the actuator in Dan 's second picture on this LONG ... <p> The control valve that you found on the passenger side above the muffler is operated by a 12 volt signal that comes from the Allison . <p> On my BMC when you turn on the exhaust brake from the dash switch that signal goes to the Trans ECM that selects the preprogramed lower gear . After the gear change the trans converter locks up . Once the converter is locked then the Allision turns on the 12 volt solenoid air valve . That valve applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I check my valve and actuator each winter by airing up the coach and then with the engine off I apply 12 volts to the solenoid valve through the weather pack plug .

@@61178837 @1178837/ 188181 @qwx598181 <p> To all who sit on the THRONE when it is a Microphor toilet . I have a model Microphor Toilet LF220 in my coach and it does not hold the water after use . When the business is done and all is flushed away , the bowl fills with water and the water slowly leaks out . About 1/2 hour , and the bowl is dry . I suspect the Flapper valve/seal to be the culprit . In order to change the gasket on the Flapper , does the flapper have to come out ? . If that 's the case , in order to get the flapper out , does the whole toilet has to be taken out ? The Internet shows parts for the LF220 as Flapper Valve Assembly $39.00Flapper replacement Kit $55.00 Anybody ever had any experience with this ? <p> I went thru all this . According to Microphor , you can replace the flapper seal w/o dismantling the entire toilet . The new seal is stick-on ; the old seal has ten or so rubber nubs that you pull thru small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my toilet out when Ernie did my floor . The entire toilet was already disassembled . I found that my original seal was good . The reason it leaked was because of deposits on the toilet porcelain bowl where the seal meets the bowl . I cleaned it up with white vinegar , lubed the old seal with silicon grease and put it back together - no more leaks . While in theory the new seal can be " stuck on " , the mechanical fastening of the old seal seems superior . I 'm not sure if the " old " style seal is still available , I think not . If it were , you do have to remove the bowl from the hopper to put the old style back on the flapper . <p> Microphor will send a VHS tape on how to maintain your microphor . The US distrinutor for parts is Mullaney assoc. in NJ - - Ed Mullaney knows his **** literally ! ! url is www.edmullaney.com and his # is 856-596-1299 and his cell is 856-229-1054. - - very helpful ! ! Lotsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't help you , but then again maybe it will . One of the best things I did to my coach was ditch the Microphor toilet completely . I installed a porcelain bowl Thetford toilet with foot pedal flush and fill and it has been wonderful and worry free . The Microphor started to leak on the floor and there were some other problems and it was just a PITA . <p> I cut out the larger sewer pipe hole and routed it to the holding tank , cut the larger hole in the tank , secured it , sealed it and put the new toilet in place . Half a days work for someone with not much do it yourself experience and it was done . NEVER to worry about the Microphor functioning properly again . The simple foot pedal operation works every time and it looks good too . <p> I am real picky about my coach and I was previously worried about making my luxury coach into more of a regular RV . I thought a foot pedal toilet would demean my baby . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is classy as ever . Simpler is much better and is still as good looking as the malfunctioning Microphor . <p> Thanks for the note . I too was running into some issues with my microphor and was tempted to replace it . The bowl would n't hold water , air leaks caused the 12V air compressor to run way too often , etc . But this is an 8 year old toilet . I removed it , cleaned it , and renewed and lubed all the seals , both in the toilet and in the air/water sequence valve , and it works like a charm . Microphor suggests lubing the seals every 5 years , so replacing them every 10 years seems reasonable . In retrospect , this is very little maintenance and is very easy to do . The toilet is 100% rebuildable with a very simple and cheap rebuild kit ( mostly seals ) and nothing more than an allen wrench . I like it . It 's elegant , it lasts , it allows you to locate the toilet anywhere , and it really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item when rebuilding is re-installing the hopper to the porcelain bowl . Two long threaded rods are used . The angle of these rods and the tension on the nuts is key . With a little fiddling its simple to get a water tight seal . With the toilet removed , I rigged mine up to a water and air supply and ran it thru a few cycles to test for leaks . This turned out to be a crucial step cause the first time it did leak at the hopper to bowl interface - you want to catch this before you put it back in the coach . Just my two cents . <p> So far I 've had good luck with my microphor . I rebuilt the sequence valve about two years ago as a precaution , and replaced the flapper rubber gasket , the stick on one . It has worked fine . Of course , as I 'm typing this Murphy is probably sitting on my toilet right now . <p> I know this does n't help you , but then again maybe it will .

I was n't too hard but I did have to remove the toliet . I got the flapper rebuild kit and the only part I could use with my non air john was the flapper and a large gasket used between the flapper bowl assy . I really did n't need the gasket as the one I removed was silicone . i could have saved 20 bucks by just getting the flapper . Anyway works great now and the blow holds water . If you rebuild yours replace the thin 3/4 plastic overflow hose ( 2 bucks ) . After putting mine back I found it was leaking and would have been much easier to replace while it was out

We could not find any valves under the step that we could use to release the jack . Anyone have any ideas or can anyone suggest who to call in the Myrtle Beach area to help us . <p> From what I have heard is that some coaches have a T-valve under the step that you just open in cases like this , but several of us looked and could n't find one . I need to find out if there is one in another location or if there is an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not positive , but I thought that the T-handles for releasing pressure on the jacks were located above the generator fan compartment in an area directly below the driver 's seat area .

The Aqua-Hot burner makes noise for a couple of minutes but does not ignite . Then green light goes out and unit shuts down after a couple of minutes . <p> Answer - What you are experiencing is a failure in the start up sequence of the diesel burner . <p> When you turn on the diesel heat , the diesel burner goes into a lighting sequence . The following things happen in this order . <p> The blower motor starts , which starts the fuel pump . <p> The motor runs for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stabilize . <p> The fuel solenoid opens ( spraying fuel into the burning chamber ) , the ignition coil starts creating a spark across the electrodes ( igniting the fuel that has been sprayed into the burning chamber ) . <p> There is a very slight delay . The photocell ( that is adjacent to the burning chamber ) looks for light from the burning diesel fuel . <p> The photocell inside of the unit will look for flame ( light ) . If it sees light , everything is good and the burner will continue to run . <p> If the photocell DOES NOT see light , the fuel solenoid closes and the diesel ' light next to the switch in your coach goes out . The blower continues to run ( purge cycle ) for about 2-3 minutes to purge unburned diesel ( and heat if the unit has been running ) . <p> Blower motor shuts down . <p> As you can see , this is a complicated sequence . If ANY component fails to operate properly , the diesel burner will not operate . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek out authorized repair technician . We have some testing equipment that allows us to check out each component involved in the start up sequence separately . <p> It could be any of the following items that have failed : fuel pump , solenoid valve , ignition coil ( +wires + electrodes ) , or photocell . It could be as simple as a clogged nozzle . <p> There is excellent troubleshooting information in the Aqua-Hot shop manual for your unit . Here : LONG ... You should also check to make sure that you have sufficient fuel in your tank . The fuel tank pick up line is like the generator ; it will not pick up fuel if the tank is less than + full . I have heard of coaches that wo n't draw diesel if the tank is less than 1/3 + full .

After I put the cover back on and closed the bay door , tried it again and can still hear it , but very faintly . Maybe it has been doing it all along and I was not close enough to hear it . Called Aqua Hot and the tech said he had never heard of this before . Has anyone had this sound before ? <p> The only relays in your Aqua-Hot are the three relays with the clear plastic cover over them and the relays in the silver box . <p> The 3 plastic relays control the pumps and the interior fans . The only interface that they have with the Webasto unit is the red wire that comes out of the Webasto wiring harness and connects to the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service make sure that you replaced it in the proper place .

If you can reach the oil with your pinky knuckle , there 's enough oil to make it home . Mine leaked over the course of 4500 miles and was fine . The " puddle " has me a little worried ... my leak resulted in streaks of oil on the inner dual , but no puddle . MAKE SURE that the tech refills the oil in the hub galley and bearings by tilting the axle to lubricate the bearings after the seal job .

@@61178849 @1178849/ 188181 @qwx598181 <p> To all who sit on the THRONE when it is a Microphor toilet . I have a model Microphor Toilet LF220 in my coach and it does not hold the water after use . When the business is done and all is flushed away , the bowl fills with water and the water slowly leaks out . About 1/2 hour , and the bowl is dry . I suspect the Flapper valve/seal to be the culprit . In order to change the gasket on the Flapper , does the flapper have to come out ? . If that 's the case , in order to get the flapper out , does the whole toilet has to be taken out ? The Internet shows parts for the LF220 as Flapper Valve Assembly $39.00Flapper replacement Kit $55.00 Anybody ever had any experience with this ? <p> I went thru all this . According to Microphor , you can replace the flapper seal w/o dismantling the entire toilet . The new seal is stick-on ; the old seal has ten or so rubber nubs that you pull thru small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my toilet out when Ernie did my floor . The entire toilet was already disassembled . I found that my original seal was good . The reason it leaked was because of deposits on the toilet porcelain bowl where the seal meets the bowl . I cleaned it up with white vinegar , lubed the old seal with silicon grease and put it back together - no more leaks . While in theory the new seal can be " stuck on " , the mechanical fastening of the old seal seems superior . I 'm not sure if the " old " style seal is still available , I think not . If it were , you do have to remove the bowl from the hopper to put the old style back on the flapper . <p> Microphor will send a VHS tape on how to maintain your microphor . The US distrinutor for parts is Mullaney assoc. in NJ - - Ed Mullaney knows his **** literally ! ! url is www.edmullaney.com and his # is 856-596-1299 and his cell is 856-229-1054. - - very helpful ! ! Lotsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't help you , but then again maybe it will . One of the best things I did to my coach was ditch the Microphor toilet completely . I installed a porcelain bowl Thetford toilet with foot pedal flush and fill and it has been wonderful and worry free . The Microphor started to leak on the floor and there were some other problems and it was just a PITA . <p> I cut out the larger sewer pipe hole and routed it to the holding tank , cut the larger hole in the tank , secured it , sealed it and put the new toilet in place . Half a days work for someone with not much do it yourself experience and it was done . NEVER to worry about the Microphor functioning properly again . The simple foot pedal operation works every time and it looks good too . <p> I am real picky about my coach and I was previously worried about making my luxury coach into more of a regular RV . I thought a foot pedal toilet would demean my baby . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is classy as ever . Simpler is much better and is still as good looking as the malfunctioning Microphor . <p> Thanks for the note . I too was running into some issues with my microphor and was tempted to replace it . The bowl would n't hold water , air leaks caused the 12V air compressor to run way too often , etc . But this is an 8 year old toilet . I removed it , cleaned it , and renewed and lubed all the seals , both in the toilet and in the air/water sequence valve , and it works like a charm . Microphor suggests lubing the seals every 5 years , so replacing them every 10 years seems reasonable . In retrospect , this is very little maintenance and is very easy to do . The toilet is 100% rebuildable with a very simple and cheap rebuild kit ( mostly seals ) and nothing more than an allen wrench . I like it . It 's elegant , it lasts , it allows you to locate the toilet anywhere , and it really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item when rebuilding is re-installing the hopper to the porcelain bowl . Two long threaded rods are used . The angle of these rods and the tension on the nuts is key . With a little fiddling its simple to get a water tight seal . With the toilet removed , I rigged mine up to a water and air supply and ran it thru a few cycles to test for leaks . This turned out to be a crucial step cause the first time it did leak at the hopper to bowl interface - you want to catch this before you put it back in the coach . Just my two cents . <p> So far I 've had good luck with my microphor . I rebuilt the sequence valve about two years ago as a precaution , and replaced the flapper rubber gasket , the stick on one . It has worked fine . Of course , as I 'm typing this Murphy is probably sitting on my toilet right now . <p> I know this does n't help you , but then again maybe it will .

I was n't too hard but I did have to remove the toliet . I got the flapper rebuild kit and the only part I could use with my non air john was the flapper and a large gasket used between the flapper bowl assy . I really did n't need the gasket as the one I removed was silicone . i could have saved 20 bucks by just getting the flapper . Anyway works great now and the blow holds water . If you rebuild yours replace the thin 3/4 plastic overflow hose ( 2 bucks ) . After putting mine back I found it was leaking and would have been much easier to replace while it was out

If these two items are not done you may have that condition . There are many other things that can be wrong but these are the simple things you can do to see if this will fix you issue .

The Aqua-Hot burner makes noise for a couple of minutes but does not ignite . Then green light goes out and unit shuts down after a couple of minutes . <p> Answer - What you are experiencing is a failure in the start up sequence of the diesel burner . <p> When you turn on the diesel heat , the diesel burner goes into a lighting sequence . The following things happen in this order . <p> The blower motor starts , which starts the fuel pump . <p> The motor runs for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stabilize . <p> The fuel solenoid opens ( spraying fuel into the burning chamber ) , the ignition coil starts creating a spark across the electrodes ( igniting the fuel that has been sprayed into the burning chamber ) . <p> There is a very slight delay . The photocell ( that is adjacent to the burning chamber ) looks for light from the burning diesel fuel . <p> The photocell inside of the unit will look for flame ( light ) . If it sees light , everything is good and the burner will continue to run . <p> If the photocell DOES NOT see light , the fuel solenoid closes and the diesel ' light next to the switch in your coach goes out . The blower continues to run ( purge cycle ) for about 2-3 minutes to purge unburned diesel ( and heat if the unit has been running ) . <p> Blower motor shuts down . <p> As you can see , this is a complicated sequence . If ANY component fails to operate properly , the diesel burner will not operate . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek out authorized repair technician . We have some testing equipment that allows us to check out each component involved in the start up sequence separately . <p> It could be any of the following items that have failed : fuel pump , solenoid valve , ignition coil ( +wires + electrodes ) , or photocell . It could be as simple as a clogged nozzle . <p> There is excellent troubleshooting information in the Aqua-Hot shop manual for your unit . Here : LONG ... You should also check to make sure that you have sufficient fuel in your tank . The fuel tank pick up line is like the generator ; it will not pick up fuel if the tank is less than + full . I have heard of coaches that wo n't draw diesel if the tank is less than 1/3 + full .

After I put the cover back on and closed the bay door , tried it again and can still hear it , but very faintly . Maybe it has been doing it all along and I was not close enough to hear it . Called Aqua Hot and the tech said he had never heard of this before . Has anyone had this sound before ? <p> The only relays in your Aqua-Hot are the three relays with the clear plastic cover over them and the relays in the silver box . <p> The 3 plastic relays control the pumps and the interior fans . The only interface that they have with the Webasto unit is the red wire that comes out of the Webasto wiring harness and connects to the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service make sure that you replaced it in the proper place .

I sent Ed a note just now asking for his opinion on acouple shops . I really do n't want to drive in Dallas nightmare traffic with this problem . <p> Ernie- I just replaced my inner , drive axle seal and bearing . Plenty of pics of the procedure . I can certainly talk your tech through the process if he is unfamiliar with the correct way to seat the " Scotseal " seal . Most guys will whack it in with a flat plate , but you have to be certain that they use a ring to seat the outer flange of the seal , not a punch , screwdriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the seal if they attempt to do otherwise and it will fail within a year or two . Do n't ask how I know . On my coach , you need a Scotseal Part #47697 . Should run around $40 at a supply house . If the brake shoes are soaked , you 'll need a new pair of them too . <p> p.s. - check the fluid level in the pumpkin . 1/2 " socket wrench plug on the front of the differential . If you can reach the oil with your pinky knuckle , there 's enough oil to make it home . Mine leaked over the course of 4500 miles and was fine . The " puddle " has me a little worried ... my leak resulted in streaks of oil on the inner dual , but no puddle . MAKE SURE that the tech refills the oil in the hub galley and bearings by tilting the axle to lubricate the bearings after the seal job .

We had so much fun that the wife wants to go to the quartzite rally and see some shining examples of wanderlodges . I think we will become members of the 2 bird club if she finds one she loves . It was evident in our travels that while towing our car it would be very nice to have more power and more brakes ( what I had said from the beginning btw ) so she is on board with it now ... so we are looking to upgrade our current coach or find one that makes sense and sell ours .

I changed the themostate and checked the water pump on the generator engine . The generator now runs great . Yesterday I put new exhaust manifold gaskets on the street side of the coach engine . This morning I tried to start the engine to check the exhaust for leaks . The engine starts and runs for about 10 seconds and quits . High idle switch does not change result . Accelerator pedal has no effect . Check engine light does not stay on and the codes are the same as were there when I got the coach last year . <p> My concern is that last week I tried to install a VMSpc JIB on the wrong plug and then after help from Rob , installed the JIB on right plug . It turned out the JIB was faulty . I am waiting for a replacement JIB .

It could be plugged fuel filters . I am planning on changing filters tomorrow . It seems unlikely that it is plugged filter . My vaccuum gage does not move above low range when it is trying to run . Oil pressure moves to 40 lbs . Coolant level is full . <p> I am real trouble because my wife was planning on leaving tomorrow on a two week trip . Any suggestions ? How could I determine if I messed up the ECM ? <p> when you removed the manifold did you lose the coolant ? did you refill the coolant ? the engine will shut down when there 's low coolant levels . sorry for the late reply , but the forum would not let me reply ! Randy <p> I am making some progress but I thought I would update everyone on what is happening . Using Curt 's article on replacing his fuel hoses , I built a electric prime pump and put a ball valve to open and shut the feed line . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tried to start the engine with the electric pump still running . It cranked and pumped out white smoke . After several more pump tries and more white smoke . I determined that lost prime was not the problem . It was clear that the injectors were not firing . I started worrying that I had toasted the ECM . I decided that I had to find a 92 series mechanic with some diagnostics tools . I drove to several truck repair garages and got the same response- " yea we work on Detroits " - " What do you mean 2 stroke , I never seen no 2 stroke diesel " . Then I found on the way home , the Detroit Diesel Dealer has moved to within 10 miles of my house . I found a old 92 series mechanic who was at the new facility teaching young mechanics . He took me to a 89 Newell coach and told me that if my stop engine and check engine light come with the ignition switch and then both go off after 10 seconds , my DEC ECM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with my prime pump . His response was that the injectors were not firing because I need 80 Pounds of fuel pressure to fire . He said it could be leaking hoses or fuel pump . He suggested a pressure gage to check the fuel pressure . He also showed me to which outlet hose to pull off and put in a bucket of clean fuel and crank the engine If I get bubbles in the fuel , then I likely have a bad hose . If the flow is clean and clear , then I might have a bad pump . The pressure gage will tell the story on the pump . <p> Two bad possible causes is a broken drive shaft for the pump . The other is the sensors that time the ECM . The last two options would require towing the coach to their facility . If it is a new pump , he said I should be able to replace the pump and told me the steps to pull the Coldplate/DECC . <p> So I am encouraged that I will be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep you posted . <p> The fuel pressure per my manual is said to be between 65-75 psi so the mechanic is on it . In addition to the ECM sensors there is also a fuel pressure sensor that tells the ECM all is well , more wires that could be disturbed . The pump has an internal relief valve . I will send you the drawing on that if you want the and will help . I can send you a drawing on how to deal with the cold plate . There is some sealant that needs to be used to keep water out . <p> The saga continues , here is an update : At the suggestion of the DD mechanic , I disconnected the racor out line and put into a 5 gallon bucket of clean fuel . <p> After cranking for about 2 gallons , the engine would start and run for about 20 seconds . After about 10 tries , waiting for the batteries to recharge between tries , I had run the entire 5 gallons through the engine . <p> Now the interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street side was ice cold . I think this means that the one hose must be clogged or the injectors are not firing on one side . <p> I am going to talk to the mechanic tomorrow and if he has an easy fix , I will try it one more time . Then I am giving up and having the coach towed to their facility . I hate to pay the $400 tow bill but I am tired of working in a storage lot . <p> One last question , while I was waiting for the batteries to charge , I decided to pull the air filter and check it out . It was really dirty and included a mud dabber nest . I could not get the filter out . I assume the end caps come off but I could not get either end to come off . They both seem to be welded in place . I searched the forums for some answers but found no info . How does the filter come out ? <p> the air filter is contained in the metal can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry , there 's only a few fuel lines on the 8V92 , there 's one from the racor to the fuel pump , then from the pump to the fuel filter on the engine , the from the filter you have two lines , one goes to each head , the street ide ie easy to change , change it and see what happens . also , when you run a detroit out of fuel you can bleed the air out of the filter by loosening the fuel lines on top of the filter and cranking the engine over until clean fuel comes out around the lines , then tighten the lines , start the engine by holding the gas pedal to the floor , this opens the injectors wide open and helps get the air out of the lines . call me if you want to talk about it . Randy 352 538 3435 <p> Today I talked to the old series 92 guru at Detroit Diesel about what could cause one bank to not fire . He said it could be several things , a clogged fuel hose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I checked the hose for that side by running a long screwdriver though it . Then found the two inline fuses attached to the center battery . I followed the wires to the center DEC plug . That plug has two green wires that go to the battery ground lug . Four orange wires that merge into two wires that go to the inline fuses . One fuse is the curb side bank injectors power and the other is the street side bank injectors power . I wire brushed all the connectors and checked the DEC plug wires for 12 volts . <p> I found that someone had cut a wire off the engine that looked like a ground , so I added a ground wire from the engine to the ground bar just for good measure . <p> After purging the air , the old 8V92 fired up and I pushed the high idle switch for that great purrrrr . <p> This difficult situation was a real learning experience . I feel so much more comfortable now with the engine . While I have worked on a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery that worried me a lot . I now know what I would do if the beast quits on the road some time . I somehow gained a real understanding of the fuel and DEC system . Just knowing that if the check engine goes out after the 10 second start-up , the DEC is likely OK is a great help . I was so worried that I had cooked the DEC . <p> I really appreciate knowing that all you guys are here to make suggestions and send diagrams when we need them . Thanks again and I am ready to help with some suggestions now on the fuel and injectors system .

This is tough to know , for sure , as the oil turns black very quickly after a change , due to the nature of diesel engines . <p> Other than a difference in the oil pan or a failure to fully drain the engine , I ca n't think of any other reason that the oil capacity might be less that other Series-60 engines used by Wanderlodge . <p> Of course installation of a " wrong " dip stick may lead to a low fill point . Perhaps you can post the dimensions of your dip stick ... and how far from the end the full mark appears . <p> I note that the distance from full to low on my dip stick was approximately one gallon ( not quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... or using the wrong mark on the dip stick could have a difference of a gallon or two in the refill . ( I also note that my coach would " eat " the first couple of quarts very quickly ... then would run very happily with the dip stick reading about 1/2 way between the full and low marks -- hardly using any more oil after the first couple of quarts . ) <p> Mallie , coupled with the symptoms described when you were running at the previous " full " mark " , ( down 3 gallons ) I would say that your 10 gal fill is likely correct and you have an incorrect dipstick . The symptoms you describe are exactly how one would expect an engine that was down 30% of oil capacity to behave . But by all means check with DD or anyone else that may know for sure like the PO or perhaps any old service invoices could give you some insight . <p> Curt , I know the capacity of the 60 depends on application , but I think most if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe his is exactly like mine , and i had him measure the stick to the full mark , 48 inches .

Jim , , that was my logic and I feel real sure it is just the wrong stick . Just glad I got it figured out . Glad we have this group to help solving things like this , , Thanks all , appreciate the e mails , responses , help .

Do you know if there is any electrical outlet near the generator battery on the M380 ? <p> The axillary air compressor is hard wired into a junction box just forward of the generator battery .

You have a 12 volt Thomas ( brand ) air compressor that likely goes to your Microphor toilet and probably your slide air seals . You also have the optional 110 volt air compressor . Your engine air compressor services the needs of the chassis ( the suspension , brakes and some accessories . ) Your 12 volt compressor probably runs whenever you need air for the toilet or your seals need air . Your 110 volt air compressor may ( or may not ) be tied into your 12 volt air compressor system and your chassis air compressor system . You really have to go hand over hand on your air compressor system to see what the 110 volt air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tied into both the 12 volt air compressor system and the chassis via an air dryer and valves . <p> If your going to the Marble Falls rally next month I 'd be happy to help you hunt down what your 110 volt air compressor is tied into . Regarding which air compressor you should use to air up your tires : Almost certainly your 110 volt system assuming the minimum air pressure settings on your compressor are set at 100 psi or higher . If the minimum pressure is not set high enough you can reach a point where your tires are not up to the desired pressure and your air compressor wo n't come on . <p> Eric , I appreciate the offer . I did not know that there was a rally coming in Marble Falls . Right now , I am in Virginia Beach but we are preparing to head back to Texas . Marble Falls sounds like fun and convenient . I will look you up . <p> My Thomas compressor will not stop running . I finally pulled the power to the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption that my slide seal is leaking . I 'm also thinking the compressor is shot given the noise it is making . Is there a way to test the compressor to see if it is working correctly ? Also , how do you stop it from running constantly ? <p> Eric pretty much described your air compressors situation above . When the engine compressor is running ; it provides the air to all the systems . The 120V compressor acts as an auxillary compressor when the dash switch is on and can be used to air up the systems when you are parked or if the main engine a/c fails . In the M380 ; the 12v Thomas a/c 's only purpose is to keep the slide seals inflated when your are parked . If it is running all the time , this means that you have an air leak somewhere between it and the slide seals or the compressor in incapable of supplying any air to the seals . Sounds like the Thomas comp is unable to produce air and needs to be repaired or replaced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from W.W. Grainger . I would repair or replace the Thomas first and then see if the new or repaired compressor solves the problem . If the new compressor runs all the time then you probably have a leak . I hope it is not a slide seal leaking . <p> Note : These small Thomas compressors are not designed to run for long periods of time as they will get too hot and destroy themselves . They are designed for intermitten running times of a few seconds to a few minutes . <p> Thanks Chuck . My guess is that I have a seal leak and a bad compressor because I had noticed back in the Fall that the compressor cycled on and off every few hours . The bus has been in storage since October and I had not checked on it since December . I went to check on it today and the compressor was running and would not turn off . It had a screeching sound so I disconnected power to the compressor . Back in the Fall my slide seal twisted and I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it did inflate at the time , it must have a slow leak . I do n't look forward to figuring that out . <p> Just to tell you my experience . My Gast was cycling a quite a bit but it was because of an air leak in the coach not on the compressor . So before spending a lot of money on a new compressor or fixing something that is n't broke , make sure you do n't have an air leak someplace else in the coach . Steps , suspension , or whatever . Not sure if your system is set up like mine but my Gast will air up the coaches entire systems ; such as brakes , suspension , etc . <p> My gast compressor was running constantly when I first got it . It turned out to be an pressure release valve on the front of the compressor sticking open . I removed it , lubed it and it 's worked great ever since . <p> My Thomas compressor will not stop running . I finally pulled the power to the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption that my slide seal is leaking . I 'm also thinking the compressor is shot given the noise it is making . Is there a way to test the compressor to see if it is working correctly ? Also , how do you stop it from running constantly ? <p> I recently replaced my Thomas compressor after its motor burn out . Not sure what caused it . I found a unused replacement on Ebay for about $95 . New they are about $365 from Grainger . Rebuild kits are available from Grainger for about the cost of the complete unit from EBay . <p> I can think of 3 reasons why your compressor wo n't shut off other than slide seals or leaks in other areas ; ( 1 ) The compressor seals could have cratered , ( 2 ) the pressure switch may be malfunctioning so power is not interrupted or ( 3 ) the pressure unloader valve within the pressure switch is stuck open . <p> I suggest a you test the compressor by disconnecting the compressor discharge line and connecting a new line dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK pressure will build up rapidly . <p> Once I had an operational compressor , I was able to open and close the pressure switch contacts manually to cycle the replacement compressor . I adjusted the 12v compressor switch to shut off at about 40 psi . The unloader valve will open when the pressure switch shuts off power allowing pressure to bleed off so the compressor does n't have to restart under a load .

I will also look into installing a battery charger/maintainer which is what I did for the chasiss battery and am very pleased with it . As I posted before , the advantage of the battery charger/maintainer over the " switch " is the charger/maintainer is far less expensive than the switch and relay and I know for sure it is working . Do you know if there is any electrical outlet near the generator battery on the M380 ? <p> The axillary air compressor is hard wired into a junction box just forward of the generator battery .

I am not sure of what all the 110 is capable of and when I should use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything needed until I can get the 12v fixed . I mostly keep it off . I switch it on if I need air for the step well cover or air seals for slides . I am monitoring my air seal gauges for other reasons . Thank You <p> It sounds like you have a total of three air compressors . You have an engine mounted air compressor . You have a 12 volt Thomas ( brand ) air compressor that likely goes to your Microphor toilet and probably your slide air seals . You also have the optional 110 volt air compressor . Your engine air compressor services the needs of the chassis ( the suspension , brakes and some accessories . ) Your 12 volt compressor probably runs whenever you need air for the toilet or your seals need air . Your 110 volt air compressor may ( or may not ) be tied into your 12 volt air compressor system and your chassis air compressor system . You really have to go hand over hand on your air compressor system to see what the 110 volt air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tied into both the 12 volt air compressor system and the chassis via an air dryer and valves . <p> If your going to the Marble Falls rally next month I 'd be happy to help you hunt down what your 110 volt air compressor is tied into . Regarding which air compressor you should use to air up your tires : Almost certainly your 110 volt system assuming the minimum air pressure settings on your compressor are set at 100 psi or higher . If the minimum pressure is not set high enough you can reach a point where your tires are not up to the desired pressure and your air compressor wo n't come on . <p> Eric , I appreciate the offer . I did not know that there was a rally coming in Marble Falls . Right now , I am in Virginia Beach but we are preparing to head back to Texas . Marble Falls sounds like fun and convenient . I will look you up . <p> My Thomas compressor will not stop running . I finally pulled the power to the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption that my slide seal is leaking . I 'm also thinking the compressor is shot given the noise it is making . Is there a way to test the compressor to see if it is working correctly ? Also , how do you stop it from running constantly ? <p> Eric pretty much described your air compressors situation above . When the engine compressor is running ; it provides the air to all the systems . The 120V compressor acts as an auxillary compressor when the dash switch is on and can be used to air up the systems when you are parked or if the main engine a/c fails . In the M380 ; the 12v Thomas a/c 's only purpose is to keep the slide seals inflated when your are parked . If it is running all the time , this means that you have an air leak somewhere between it and the slide seals or the compressor in incapable of supplying any air to the seals . Sounds like the Thomas comp is unable to produce air and needs to be repaired or replaced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from W.W. Grainger . I would repair or replace the Thomas first and then see if the new or repaired compressor solves the problem . If the new compressor runs all the time then you probably have a leak . I hope it is not a slide seal leaking . <p> Note : These small Thomas compressors are not designed to run for long periods of time as they will get too hot and destroy themselves . They are designed for intermitten running times of a few seconds to a few minutes . <p> Thanks Chuck . My guess is that I have a seal leak and a bad compressor because I had noticed back in the Fall that the compressor cycled on and off every few hours . The bus has been in storage since October and I had not checked on it since December . I went to check on it today and the compressor was running and would not turn off . It had a screeching sound so I disconnected power to the compressor . Back in the Fall my slide seal twisted and I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it did inflate at the time , it must have a slow leak . I do n't look forward to figuring that out . <p> Just to tell you my experience . My Gast was cycling a quite a bit but it was because of an air leak in the coach not on the compressor . So before spending a lot of money on a new compressor or fixing something that is n't broke , make sure you do n't have an air leak someplace else in the coach . Steps , suspension , or whatever . Not sure if your system is set up like mine but my Gast will air up the coaches entire systems ; such as brakes , suspension , etc . <p> My gast compressor was running constantly when I first got it . It turned out to be an pressure release valve on the front of the compressor sticking open . I removed it , lubed it and it 's worked great ever since . <p> My Thomas compressor will not stop running . I finally pulled the power to the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption that my slide seal is leaking . I 'm also thinking the compressor is shot given the noise it is making . Is there a way to test the compressor to see if it is working correctly ? Also , how do you stop it from running constantly ? <p> I recently replaced my Thomas compressor after its motor burn out . Not sure what caused it . I found a unused replacement on Ebay for about $95 . New they are about $365 from Grainger . Rebuild kits are available from Grainger for about the cost of the complete unit from EBay . <p> I can think of 3 reasons why your compressor wo n't shut off other than slide seals or leaks in other areas ; ( 1 ) The compressor seals could have cratered , ( 2 ) the pressure switch may be malfunctioning so power is not interrupted or ( 3 ) the pressure unloader valve within the pressure switch is stuck open . <p> I suggest a you test the compressor by disconnecting the compressor discharge line and connecting a new line dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK pressure will build up rapidly . <p> Once I had an operational compressor , I was able to open and close the pressure switch contacts manually to cycle the replacement compressor . I adjusted the 12v compressor switch to shut off at about 40 psi . The unloader valve will open when the pressure switch shuts off power allowing pressure to bleed off so the compressor does n't have to restart under a load .

( The Auragen install is a separate story to be told later . <p> I am an FC owner and a new ( to me ) BMC owner ( with 8.3 Cummins ) , so I am no expert here , and I am not sure which 8.3 you have or how many fuel filters you have , BUT I think if you take off all of the fuel filters that you have and fill them with diesel or ATF and put them back on you should be able to get it started . My understanding is that the Cummins does not need " bled " like a Cat 3208 does , so just filling them up should do the job . Hopefully Woody will chime in as well . <p> 3 filters . Motor is cummins 6CTA-8.3 , rated 250hp made in ' 88 in-line 6 . I just called mechanic who replaced the filters before I set out on this venture to tell me where they are , ( proximate cause of the replacement being his belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , symptom of which was lack of a steady hum accelerating either still or in motion ) . He tells me I probably only need to fill the one I drained . He says an electric transfer pump would be nice in this situation . I will try refilling this filter by hand and note here if it works . If this works , it seems to me that a sufficient denial of fuel to the motor to make it stop could have been simply removing this filter ( though I think that might have been challenging , maybe even dangerous , in the dark with the engine hot and running . <p> On the left side of the motor there is your fuel pump on the end of it you will find a primer piston--turn it and pump it up and down until it starts to get tight then crank it------if that do n't  work----- <p> To prime the fuel system eaiser , you need to remove both of the fuel filters . fill the filters with clean diesel , and reinstall filter . there should be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on driver side back of engine ) in the return line . To prime the system , you pump on the piston ( fuel pump is driver side below filters ) untill no air comes out of the plug .. then if it do n't  start------- <p> Sometimes if there is air in the system after priming the filter , you may need to bleed the system , to do this you need a proper sized wrench to crack open the fuel line for the #1 injector. after cracking this open about 1/2-3/4 turn , crank engine with foot on floor every time . The engine will run ruff and under powered and smoke for a bit but do n't  stop it now ! once engine is running , watch for diesel to squirt out of opened line , and listen for engine to start to run more smooth once engine reaches this point , re tighten fuel line so it no longer leaks . the engine will then purge any other air in the system and will run smooth and properly . <p> Filled all 3 filters . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet as it 's now dark . Something new though : When I connect the two battery banks ( house &amp; starting ) , the starter makes a whirring sound . This without turning the ignition key . When I turn the ignition key with the battery banks connected , there 's no starter turnover . - However , with the battery banks isolated , when I turn the ignition key there 's an honest attempt at starter turnover , only no ignition . ( I know : this vehicle did n't come with the battery bank functions separated since originally equipped it had only one battery bank . I had this improvement made since purchase . ) <p> In my attempt to stop the unstoppable motor , I cut the starter wire by mistake . But I 've since reconnected it .

( The Auragen install is a separate story to be told later . <p> For engines that do not have an electric priming pump , Cummins has always recommended prefilling the fuel filter(s) before installation . At the moment it sounds like you have an injection system that has a lot of air in it . It is not going to start .

Use no more than 3 PSI as you do not want to deform the tank walls . That head pressure will push the fuel into the filter(s) . You may need to loosen a fitting after the last filter to allow air to purge from that point . <p> You may be at the point of needing " the hook " to haul it to a service shop to get the system bled out and restarted . <p> Thanks to everybody for telling me how to get this baby going again . I should point out that this would not have been a problem if I 'd known in advance of the motor not stopping how to shut it off without completely draining it of fuel ( though I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel some time ) . So do n't be like me : Be prepared and read the string about shutting down a motor that wo n't stop before you need to do it . ( By the way , my motor has a mechanical pump , no bulb ) . <p> What got it going again was following the suggestions you all made and resorting to Woody 's suggestions for extreme situations , in brief : 1 ) remove all fuel filters ( of course this requires finding them = knowing where they are is even better ) and filling them to the brim with fuel and screwing them back on 2 ) unscrewing the first fuel injector inlet about a turn 3 ) removing the cap at the fuel fill ( that you use at filling stations ) 4 ) repeatedly pushing in the piston on the fuel pump WHILE the ignition key is turned on ( but not so far as to make the starter start ) and UNTIL you hear a slight squeak type sound from the front of the motor and you keep pushing for awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see fuel coming out of the first fuel injector you loosened the nut of .

@@61178895 @1178895/ <p> I am finally back to Gulfport . As many of you know my transmission bit the dust about 35 miles east of Dallas .

I was traveling in west Texas and the wind was blowing about 30 knots and I was going up a slight incline so I thought it just could n't get up to speed because of the driving conditions . Finally it got worse so I stopped and checked the fluid and the level was fine . My next step was to change the fuel filters , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The filter change was ineffective . I then smelled the fluid and it had a welding shop smell . It would almost burn your nose . When the transmission shop ran the pressures on it , they were off . When the Allison man smelled it , he said that the bands were without a doubt burned out . They told me that I needed to get the new transmission hot at least once a month and preferrable run it about ten miles a month . They explained to me that these buses are designed to run all day every day . And when most people get them they might spend many months just sitting around . The bands are left to dry on the top half and all the seals start to dry . They also told me that these old transmissions have a mineral oil base and that they would start to grow bacteria just like you find in old diesel tanks .

I have gotten three different answers from three people at the Michigan Secretary of State hotline , and I do n't trust any of them knew what they were talking about . <p> Well Mike , in Michigan , plate cost is calculated based on the original selling price of whatever motor vehicle you are plating . So , sounds scary right ? ? ? Well , the Secretary of State does n't have a book that goes back to 1986 ( the year of my coach ) , so they asked me how much it cost . I played dumb . They asked what I thought the original price of the chassis of the motor home cost . I guessed 20,000 dollars . They said OK , your plate is @90 dollars a year .

Of course it does n't help our roads that the weight limit here is nearly double the limit on the next nearest state .

At the drip rate you 've got , you may not even drain the overflow tank in 150 miles , so coolant loss during the trip probably is n't a real concern . Does it drip more when it 's cold ?

The real worry comes in whether the seal will hold or completely let go during the trip . Do ya feel lucky ? Also , if the bushing/bearing is going in the pump , you may lose the pump shaft completely , which will create a really big mess beyond what a simple leaking seal will do . <p> So , the next thought is that you only need to drain enough coolant out to get below the level of the pump , you do not need to drain the entire system !

This is a Cummins 8.3 . <p> Randy is correct , it is in back of the air compressor , it also drives the fan ... Mine does the same on occasion , even after fluid and filter change last week ... The thing is , that if your fan is running at full rpm then it is taking some of the power away from the steering , there is a proportional valve which puts the flow to the most needed system , fan or steering ...

Now , I have real smooth down shift . <p> When I set up my cable adjustment , I did it just as described in the manual with a little bit of end travel allowed at the end of the cable so that the cable does not bottom out before the fuel injector pump linkage is all the way to the stop .

It took 45 minutes to get the transmission up to temperature ( 180 F ) . <p> Hi Tim , I am having similar issues with my cable and would really like to replace it . Do you think it would be exactly the same cable for an 84 FC35 ? Did you do the job yourself ?

You should still have been able to crank , unless your voltage was seriously low ( less than 11v ) . <p> If the situation occurs again , you should stop the coach , shut down the engine , and open the generator tray .

The genny should crank . If it does n't crank , and you have good voltage , then your problem is likely the actual starter . <p> I have a Powertech 10KW generator with a Kubota engine . It would not start the second day while day camping and I thought my battery had run down too much . When trying to start it , it hit about 2 licks and then went dead and nothing would happen . I tried every switch to turn it on ( there are several ) including the one on the side of the generator thinking I might have a bad switch but none of them worked . I clicked the reset button on and off , still no results . <p> I tried the battery switch to use the engine batteries ( I know those are in great shape ) instead of the coach batteries , still nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them very well but did not try to start it at that point ( figured I 'd have more time the next day if the problem continued ) <p> Then I tried the switch on the dash again after runnning down the road awhile the next day and heard the generator come on .

I canceled it of course , but I can only imagine how much labor would have been required to find that the " unnecessary relay " was the problem . Since Kubota engines not in motor homes do n't have that , it is something they probably would n't be looking for or familiar with . <p> And my puddle under the bus had dried up so I was able to splice my heater hose with only a small coolant shower this time .

A number of people have added dedicated chassis/engine batteries to separate them from the coach batteries and get more cold cranking amps . There are a number of threads on this subject , scroll down to the bottom of this page and you will find some of them listed or do a search for even more .

Are you able to turn anything on inside ? <p> It is not unreasonable to accept that this coach could only have the two engine batteries and the generator battery . Sometimes we forget Blue Bird would do what your wallet wanted them to do . Maybe the initial owner had a smaller wallet at the time . We have a few odd birds on the forum , some without all the batteries we would expect , some without invertors . So what we think is not normal for a Bluebird is in fact normal . Maybe whoever ordered the bus did n't feel the need , maybe they were only going to use it in RV parks and never dry camp . Maybe they ran the generator more than most there could be several reasons why it is set up the way it is.

@@61179066 @1179066/ <p> Now something struck me about this new craigslist listing of the 83 ' . It shows the difference between buying cheap , and buying value . I think we have discussed it somewhere else . Counting the costs ..... <p> I would like to compare these two coaches . I do not know either one or their owners . I am a long distance shopper . I have to make good decisions before I travel across country for a potential coach . I have to glean info and process it , and info come from many sources . Just how these two coaches are listed tells me a lot . <p> Both coaches are similar age . My feeling is I would have to spend the difference in the asking price ( and probably more ) to get the 83 ' up to the standards of the 84 ' . Or could I get it back up to that condition ? The 84 ' has all the marks of a coach that has been loved and maintained . It is proudly displayed , with a super good website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of upgrades . The amount and quality of the photos tell me they are not trying to hide anything , they are trying to display it ! <p> The 83 ' list only the standard equipment , no history of any upgrades , needs a paint job ( $10 to $14K or more ) a 7kw gen set ( $ ? for upgrade ? ) I can suspect tires , batteries , on and on . Just to get it roadworthy . Then you get to living onboard , all the lockers , the spaces , neglected upkeep will start to drive me nutz ! This is all speculation . What I am trying to illustrate is how two birds close in age might differ . And the initial impression is strong for me on both birds , one is good , one is work . These coaches are a lot of work no matter how good they are . I can on imagine how much toil a troubled coach is . <p> So if I take the 83 and dump $26K into it , will I have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting the time ( months/years ? ) I do not mean to denegrate the 83 ' in any way .

I am happy with my bird and with the help of all of these fine folks I am still surviving after a week .

Replace a few hydraulic hoses that looked bad and had the fad flow tested . The rad shop said all was well . so we put it back it . Looking at the picture Steve posted before we pulled it , it seems to be " not too bad " . But once we got it out and saw the side facing the fan , well ... a picture is worth a thousand words . The cooling fins just turned to dust when you touched them . Yet 5 years ago it was n't that bad . Then when the rad shop pulled the tanks , we saw why she was tending to heat up a bit on long hills . NEVER overheating , just hitting 200 to 205 . Too hot for me ! I like to keep between 180 and 190 MAX . <p> And when we did the Jake brake at Terry 's place 2 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock 9G90 to one step bigger to a 9G95 . This was on the advise of the Diesel Doctor in San Diego . We set the injector timing at 1.484 at that time . Stock DD setting for the original injectors was 1.458 . She ran good with the new settings , but was considerably dirtier . With lots of black smoke until she was fully up to RPM . And especially pulling hills . Way more than with stock injectors . So , I figured while the rad was out , and the driver side valve cover was easy to pull , I wanted to do some readjusting on the injectors and check the valves . So after talking with a friend at DD and consulting with Terry " The Wrench " , we decide to back the injector timing off a bit . I recently bought the entire DD tune up tool kit . It has 8 different injector timing tools for all different applications . Since the new injectors are slight larger that stock , we decide to go back to a nearly stock setting . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the valves . They were all perfect at 16 thousands . Now she REALLY runs great . Very little black smoke taking off and almost nothing on the hills . Even pulling the 12,000 lb trailer I can pass most big rigs going up . It will interesting to see if the new adjustments change fuel mileage . <p> All in all ... the work we just did at Steve 's was well worth the effort and expense . She 's running great . Staying cool . And cruising well . <p> since I still ca n't figure out how to post pictures on the WOG . I will get a few shots of the engine compartment and send them to Steve to post . I especially got ta show off my new set of digital gauges I have in the engine compartment . <p> good post Don ! Just checking to see if you remembered what you did ! I did remember you having the rad out , just did n't remember the reason . Ans now i understand the adjustments , most times valve adjustments are years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset the injector timing . His valve adjustments were spot on after 2 years . interesting stuff . <p> I repainted the exhaust with header paint . To do it right , you need to sandblast them to remove all traces of rust . For best results , be sure to follow the instructions on the can . Most of the better , ceramic type , header paints require baking the item in an oven for a certain period of time . Since I was working at Steve 's place , I did not want to ask Lil to use her oven . I did not want to smell up the house with paint cooking . Most header paints have a procedure to use the engine heat to bake it . That is the method I used . It 's not a good as using an over , but it does keep the paint on longer . I recommend using your oven if you can . 
@@61179073 @1179073/ <p> Most Frequently Asked Questions About Operating SystemsHere you will find some of the most frequently asked questions about the operating systems on a ' Bird . If you have one that you think should be added place it in here . <p> The black water drain valve will not pull out . It has worked in the past , however , the Bird has been out of service for three years , so it may have corroded shut . I 'm open to any suggestions for unsticking or replacement . The Bird is a 1982 Wanderlodge , corner bed , mid-bath diesel puller . <p> jim before you buy a new valve , undue the two screws just below the handle and pull the whole paddle assembly out . clean it off good woth a brush and some soap in a pail of water and see if tzher is any rips or deformation of the rubber seals on the paddle . if not clean the cavity out where you pulled the paddle from particularly the bottom . You need a good flashlight to see down into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease that is not water soluable. teve is the place to go if you need a new paddle .

Can you imagine pulling that valve apart with a tank 1/2 full that has been sitting for a few years and it has no where to go but out that hole you just created . A plumbers nightmare <p> Bill there is another good reason to check the waste tanks beforemyou even use the coach if it has been sittimg for some time or even has been used in a RV park alot while having the waste hose connected and tahe waste valves open . tje liquod drys up leaving hard waste on the floor of the tan . If you see it upon imspecting the tank , put a bag of ice cubes down the toilet and drive around for a half hour or so and then dump . tje ice slidimg aroumd should clean the waste tank out <p> the valve can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump then place a rag around the top of the valve pull remove but do not completely remove it the majority of the waste if there is any will go down the sewer a small portion MAY come up through the body of the valve the valve is designed to have minimal clearance fore liquid in the body of the valve all you loose is the rag and no mess <p> I always leave the hose connected but the valve closed so I do not get any build up in the tank and then dump when it gets almost full . I wonder if any coaches have an alarm that tell you when the tank is full ? 
@@61179075 @1179075/ 188182 @qwx598182 <p> Hi all . Started my pretrip yesterday for Shippshewa and discovered only the freezer side of the fridge is . Cooling down . Checked the 2 glass fuses in the control module all ok . Coach stationary slight angle . Tried it again tday drove down to the Blue Beacon for a bath . Run time approx 1.5 hr . Still not cooling on fridge side . Temp setting #4 . ANY ideas appreciated . <p> I have been having the same symptoms , so I am interested in this too . Currently my Bird is at United RV in Fort Worth , waiting in line for at least two weeks . I had to leave it there and they will not let us stay in it , not even just to sleep overnight . <p> Does anyone ( Ernie ? ) know of a place around Fort Worth that would work on a Dometic refrigerator without having to leave it there while waiting in line ? <p> Jimmy , If your a full timer and they are making you leave your coach to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for that at all . Get on the phone and find an RV dealer that services your brand refer . Might even be able to find someone on line . <p> Hi all .

ANY ideas appreciated . <p> Since your going to Shipshewanna I 'd stop at Leons and have him take a look . He can replace the cooling unit if needed ... <p> When I was there last year he mentioned that the first sign of failure is lack of cooling ... YMMV , but I 'd take a close look at the tubing behind the fridge . <p> Electric only . Seems to be cooling now . I hate it when they fix themselves <p> Next time start it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start them up on electric they take longer usually . Gas seems to work faster , but is still slow . I never left the same day I started the fridge . It always took a couple of days , especially if you put warm items in it . I always cooled stuff down in the house fridge and then took it out to the bus . The warm stuff sucks all the cold out of the fridge real quick
