There was no promise for that , just an ambiguous picture . . . . <p> I think Bandai is having trouble designing the leg transformation .

How the heck is that even possible ? Would n't that kind of make kids less motivated to buy GunPla ? Like maybe the kid might think stuff like this exists in real life and they can break their precious kits . <p> Anyway , I 'm curious to see how this series does as time goes on , and if Bandai will be motivated and confident enough to do other scales of plamo for Build Fighter aside from HGs . <p> Well , god forbid a franchise originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expecting Gundam to always is cater to the jaded old hardcore fan is selfish and you know it .

GUndam Seed was titled as a legend and the best ever gundam in gundam universe by Critics . GS also have a best plots-music-characters whilst the story moves perfectly without any delayed.not too slow or too fast either . so , Seed really deserve to Crowned as Legend sorry for my mistake and no heart feeling 's kay XD <p> saying seeds ending was horrible with no arguments to back your claim up proves you do not know what your talking about also , the hate towards destiny really i understand how the characters and development was horrible but the actual story was amazing and one of the best ruined with shin being an idiot throughout and kira turning into jesus <p> Haha . Well said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever I saw scenes between Shinn and Athrun . Seriously , Rey was fucking annoying also reasoning how Shinn is " right " , albeit sometimes he makes a point . <p> The thing I kind of am disappointed with is that the widescreen is cutting off a good amount of the video . I ran the 720p version with the normal 4:3 version in sync side-by-side and all they did was add black bars to make it widescreen . I know there 's nothing else they could have done aside from re-drawing it but still . I literally put two pieces of paper on my screen where the 720p black bars were and the 4:3 looked nearly identical . Other then that the HD remaster is looking awesome especially with the fully remastered scenes . <p> I watched Gundam WING until Gundam AGE , for me Gundam SEED is the best gundam anime ... but SEED DESTINY is not as good SEED ... The SEED DESTINY MOVIE did n't work for me ... I hear in 2006/2007 they want to make SEED ETERNITY but it got canceled ... 00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they need to make WING HD Remastered too ... and for Gundam AGE I think I need too see until end first before critizing it ... <p> You have to watch/read UC . Every bit of UC starting from Freedom Fighter Gunboy all the way to Crossbone X Victory Gundam . Having seen Gundam Wing long before any UC work , as a kid imo SEED turned me off from what i thought was ' good ' about Gundam ( well blame Wing and G 's overstylized action set pieces but a lack of plot . Watching SEED 2 years after it came out REALLY REALLY bored the hell out of me . I was watching it on cable in Asia , and even when the action came , me and my brother 's bias made us flick the channel and sleep on our hotel room . And ive bought a gaming mag with an excerpt about SEED which had just debuted on our country that time ... <p> But now times have changed . I have seen some UC work , inc MSG/Freedom Fighter Gunboy , MS IGLOO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zeta , F91 , V. <p> For AC ive seen G , W , X , Turn A , SEED , 00 , AGE , some of Unicorn . <p> Still i think Zeta Gundam , with Unicorn next to it has some of the best writing plot and character development in it . As an adult who not only appreciates good action , but now a great story told unpredictably as well , with all the twists and politics and drama . most Gundam fans agree nothing comes close to Zeta . <p> But imo i really love 00 . I have a whole collection of Gunpla of it having missed out on the previous Gundam series . <p> AGE is shaping to be better IMO than SEED . AGE is retaining my vested interest in it , sure it may be lighthearted and a LOT of ignorant hateful western bakas spammed the youtube promo vid of AGE just to make a statement . Well Sunrise replied back by not premiering it in the West . AND closing down the Bandai online store . Sure you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Bluray/DVD boxsets ? Karma is a beam sabre to the cockpit ... <p> I 'm going to say that most western fans ' opinions on CE come from the MAHQ reviews and that they have n't sat through Seed or Destiny . How I look at it the CE stuff overall puts a new twist ( character connections ) on an old concept ( how terrible war is ) . Actually some of the scenes in Seed/Destiny that have soldiers killing unarmed soldiers and people getting blown up are pretty graphic and depict how visually terrible war is better than some of the older UC stuff <p> Seed are a huge copy-paste of MSG , Wing , Zone of Enders , etc. , and the previous Fukuda 's works too . If you watch one of these , you easy catch the copy-references . Examples:Wing - boyband ; Seed - ZAFT boybandZOE - OF Dolores ; Seed - Fllay and strike rouge ( probably do n't  understand if you ca n't note things like the seiyuu , the mech colors and the fact that Fllay could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is terrible ? In Seed ? No . Go away and watch a Vietnam war movie . Conspiracy theories . In Seed ? YES ! ! A lot of them ! ! <p> For me , the best alter-universe are AD ( OO ) in the overall . But for the plot , the best are the AC ( Wing ) . In the UC for me the best are Victory . Seed/Destiny are the worst Gundam series and the worst Fukuda 's works . Also I di n't like the HD changes . Does n't work for me . <p> Another Fukuda thing is the Striker Packs and Animal weapons from Gear Fighter Dendoh . I loved the idea though , like arming the same fighter with different missiles . <p> But you have to admit that Seed had more character drama . Fighting a former best friend , sleeping with a friend 's ex/girl , new best friend killed by former best friend , former best friend falling in love with sister , falling in love with former best friend 's ex-fiance . <p> Seed had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only it 's animated and has giant humanoid weapons added to the mix . <p> Dude , that 's like one of the weakest plot I 've seen in all of Gundam . G Gundam was even better than Wing in terms of plot when it comes down to it and majority does n't even consider G as a Gundam anime . <p> Wing was one of the first series shown outside of Japan . Wing 's imprinted on many of us non-Japanese as the first Gundam series we 've watched . That 's probably why so many people put it in high regard . <p> Similarly , this is also why Seed is loved so much by Bandai right now , most Japanese kids saw this as their first series and see this as representative of the whole franchise . <p> I love Zeta , F91 , G , and the first 13 episodes of Seed Destiny . Never loved Wing 's plot , I found it convoluted to the point of non-sense.Also , I really hated how Heero would have to be shot down in bird mode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invincibility of the Gundams . At least 00 fixed this by showing that skill was needed instead of just technical specs ( Graham 's Flag vs Exia in the 1st ep , also Overflag vs Throne Eins ) . <p> lol me too . wing have a weakest plot beside how the story move was so slow . i remember watch it several times , from 1-end .. god , it did n't  stabbed my heart . but , i cant critique too much , because all gundam have their own fav series . but to say GS/D was a bad-and worst ... its horrible . <p> Well in the concept of gundam as " exclusive mobile suit with superior performance " , SEED and Destiny turned it off by giving every faction at least 1 gundam unit . At the end " gundam " seemed equal to cheap mass produced unit that everyone ( yeah Earth Union , ORB , ZAFT all have that so called gundam ) . I do n't against multi gundam units , but giving that gundam can easily mass produced for everyone is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their technology stolen , wing pilots destroy their units so no piece of technology can be obtained , Seed---&gt;STOLEN and even worse MASS PRODUCED . <p> It actually looks worse . I mean look at those " action " poses ! They threw logic and perspective out of the window in order to throw in some Gainax-grade GIANT SWORD IN YER FACE shots . Not to mention how they made the characters look MORE like Kira in the facial department . This is just a way for Bandai to milk more money from the fujoshis ... <p> Logic perspectives ? Ha ha , look , something as chunky like a Gundam can fly in the atmosphere is n't really logical already . Let me point out some more , Newtype using psychic to enhance the suit 's power , damaging physical substances also is n't logical . Innovator theory is a bunch of bullshit , there 's no way human can jam their conscious into a machine or switch body . Crossbones ' clothes should constantly hinders the gundams ' movements while it is not . Hyper golden mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that are unlogical in Gundams , live with it man <p> Only thing i hate about SEED was the pairing of Lacus and Kira , other than that decent series . It seems to me that the characters are made to look like they do/will in SEED Destiny . Hopefully we 'll get an extended scene of Flay and Kira in THAT episode . <p> It 's pretty clear that one of their basic rule for making new scenes is basically any scene that ca n't be cropped easily into so called " 16:9 " and needed patching up . Some new scene actually looked worse than the old scenes , which is pretty funny . The same effort could have just been used to improve key scenes with better animation , oh well Bandai . <p> General changes* People have lesser forehead ( Athrun and Murrue specially ) * Clothing now have a brighter color* Mobile Suits are more accurately drawn having a much more realistic design and articulation . By realistic I mean 3D model and GunPla perspectives* Shadows are done right <p> I always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show , so maybe I was prejudiced , but looking at these pictures in comparison , omg the quality was quite terrible actually ! I had noticed the difference between SEED and Destiny , the characters looked way better in Destiny , although I never much cared for the sequel , but to have the Destiny quality in SEED is very nice , I like it a lot , although I should probably admit that it makes the characters look older , while they should n't be . Still , I really like the changes they made to it , and it makes me want to watch it all over again : D Thanks for the comparison pictures : D <p> Yup ! I am really happy about this Remastered thingy . Although I do n't understand why others keep on comparing one Gundam Series from the other ! Crap , each has a unique story and if you have a hell to say then go and make your own Gundam Animation ! Fukuda chiii Domo Arigato ! <p> captain ramius ' remastered is actually ' remastered ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kira 's hairstyle in this remastered is almost similar with GSD. i can say that this remastered version is actually wan na matured up the character 's face . lol <p> hellosorry i 'm just want to comment , no hard feeling okay ? its just my opinion.actually , i really like the ' remastered ' version of GS , coz ... well , you know , it looks clear ( the pic , the color ) , even the line ... hahahahaa , , ( so i wo n't be worried about my eyes being sick of those blur pictures ) .. even though it looks bigger ( or should i say ... like it was cropped ) , and i also found some changes in the anime ( for example , the ZAFT logo changing color in some areas ! ! ! and then zaku too .. ) . when i see that , i thought that it was just some error from the studio . so I SOMEWHAT let it go ( i wish there wo't be happen again ... please sunrise ) . actually there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys to find out <p> so , back again <p> overall , i still love this remastered version . <p> but ! <p> i 'm wondering about the " comparison pic " from the old version ( i conclude that mostly the pictures from left side is the old one , because the right one has the most characteristic that i got about remastered version ) . it is too BAD TO BE TRUE to be the old version one . <p> i already check it with my cousin 's GS original ( old version ) . it was TOO DIFFERENT with this pics. so , where is this comes from ? ? ? i hope there 's no conspiracy here ( i 'm sorry if there are some of you who feel kinda insulted but ONCE AGAIN ... it is just my opinion and my question ) . even though the old version is too blur for me , i still like the drawing style . so i KINDA not accept this if those pics is actually the old version . i 'm sorry ... i TOTALLY against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , please answer itcoz i love GS too much to let it go hahahahahhaaa .. <p> *once again , this is only my opinion . fell free to reply it . but please , no harsh words okay ? i 'm willingly accept the comment* <p> I ca n't wait until this Remastered nonsense is over . The characters always looked bland , I hate their designs . <p> Why did they decide to Remaster this when they already have Special Editions ? They should 've done another Gundam Series than this shit . What 's next SEED Destiny ? God no , please no ! And how can you fuckers even defend this garbage anyway ? <p> Then why do n't other Series that are more memorable get this treatment ? I 'd rather see older Series get HD treatment , why should we have 3 different versions now ? It does n't even deserve it for how terrible it was . <p> Dude remember turn a gundam that series although old school fans watched it then the young people did not and lack of media attention almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the same attention as was before so do n't blame it <p> Destiny had a great start , but went downhill the moment Kira sat down in freedom again ... Maybe they can revamp it , but they would need to redo a great deal of the story - Shin schould have stayed the main protagonist till the end . <p> I do n't know why some of you are complaining about the remaster , it 's not like the old show disappeared , you can still buy it . For example , halo combat evolved anniversary was way better than the original . What annoys me is why Seed ? They should have remastered older shows , or why not remaster Age lol . Seed and Destiny already got a special edition . But it 's nice to see the cool detailed scenes and Super Strike ! <p> The old shows HAVE been remastered , only they 're mostly not sold outside Japan except for the recent re-release of 0079 which has a new transfer . <p> But none of those shows have been RE-ANIMATED like Seed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies demonstrate why it 's probably not a good idea anyway to mix cel and digital styles . <p> Wow ... never realised the old animation looked so bad . Even 0079 and Zeta animation has aged better than this . Guess this confirms the theory that Fukuda pumped most of the show 's budget into music with little left for decent animation . <p> Agreed , Seed has probably the best OST of any Gundam show , it was one of the things that kept me hooked . Thankfully this remaster fixes some of the animation problems though I wish they did n't crop it . <p> Also not looking forward to the removal of a certain helmet ... ( C'm on Sunrise , prove me wrong ! ) <p> Agreed , while the cosmic era certainly has a solid story the writing and directing of the series was mediocre . One of the only things to push it beyond being just ok , was the music which created all those epic moments we remember . <p> I despise subtitles , but may have to put up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Destiny crew added in , lol , those that could only hint at a remaster of Destiny and unless they completely remake that , not even the Music will make that worth while . I 'd still have to give them props for taking a story in an insane albeit awful direction . <p> Wow it 's been 5-6 years since I watched Gundam Seed but holy crap I just realized how bad they look compared to the Remaster even though the time I watched it I thought the art was great lol I ca n't wait to get this on BD though I 'm still going to keep the original for memories <p> Not as soon , but it would make sense by the end of 2013 as celebrating 10 years of GSD ( wow I feel old by saying that lol ) hopefully after that remaster ( and probably STARGAZER Remaster , who knows ) we get the frigging movie , I just hope ! <p> It 's better make a reason why Shinn have SEED in GSD than re-make GS ..... GS become worse because GSD .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Freedom is can be repaired after destroyed and make Neo is not Fllaga ! Make GS 's characters same with before . Cagalli is a Cordinator SEED , tomboy , strong heart , and not weak . She will come in the wars with akatsuki . Make another MS to Neo ! Throw Kira and Lacus 's egoism ! Do n't make Kira is too strong , not crybaby , playboy , always suspicious to ZAFT , can control his SEED , can brain-connect with Rey , and like wars .... Do n't make Athrun is weak , too weak hearts , can cry in front of many people , not reasonable , and never kill enemies .... Do n't make Lacus is too womanly . Make a better reason why Rey kill Gildarts . Make Shinn and Stellar meeting is not only twice before know that Stellar is enemy , because it 's impossible Shinn can be in love in two meeting ... etc .... <p> So it turns out the final ep count of GS HD remaster is 48 eps while the original series run was 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatant clip show episodes that added nothing to the story . Thank god . <p> Also the final HD remaster ep 48 includes the ' After Phase ' epilogue where everyone gathers for dinner with the war orphans and the blind Reverend on the island . <p> I did n't  expect that old GS is this much ugly when it comes to quality of animations . I watched the old ones and compare it with this . Destiny has a remastered version too but still i do n't  like it . When kira pilots the freedom again , it makes the serries more interesting .

@@35099257 @4099257/ <p> A bit of new info for the upcoming Gundam AGE series . The list of voice actors are confirmed . But what is interesting here is that Gundam AGE is also voiced . And there were rumors going around that the Gundam in the series can talk ... Perhaps it is like ' J.A.R.V.I.S . ' , the personal artificial intelligence computer program for Tony Stark ( Iron Man movies ) , which assisted him to construct &amp; maintain the function of the Iron Man suit . Or perhaps , Gundam AGE will be a sentient computerized being to be sort of like a teacher for the main protagonists . Hardcore Gundam fans might already have a gripe with the idea of a talking Gundam . But not to worry ... Level-5 boss Akihiro Hino addressed chatter that Gundam mechas will talk in MS Gundam AGE , calling it a " misunderstanding " that the mecha can speak . According Hino , the series will be kid friendly , but wo n't deviate from traditional Gundam conventions . So no talking giant mechas !

I imagine that the voice actor for the mother and the AGE are going to be the same and it is going to talk to him either though the computer or only to him in a ' ghost ' kind of way .

Victory gundam is good example and they followed it with the V2 , beautiful on the outside but it can barely stand , it 's arms fall off at the slightest touch and it 's very brittle . The zz ver 1.0 is not good looking and it lacks all movements but it can transform so by seeing Bandai 's trend then I can say that it will have the ver ka look but it will probably lack everything else .

@@35099276 @4099276/ <h> Wednesday , October 20 , 2010 <p> The Formania MSN-04 Sazabi is a sight to behold . I 've already read plenty of reviews of this toy on the internet , but the actual sight of it on my desk really takes my breath away . Here is my little photo gallery review : <p> " When the presumed-dead Char Aznable made a surprise reappearance in the early UC 0090s , many surviving Zeon remnants and spacenoid civilians still desiring independence from the Earth Federation welcomed him with open arms . Thus , a second Neo Zeon movement was started at the colony of Sweetwater , with Char as its leader . A new revolution against the Federation was now brewing , and as the new Neo Zeon military began building its forces , Char commissioned his engineers to design him a custom mobile suit to take advantage of his Newtype abilities and superb piloting skills . " <p> ( Char figure not included ) <p> " This design was the MSN-04 Sazabi , and it was constructed by the Luna-based contractor Anaheim Electronics . Despite its large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough thrusters and verniers to make it extremely maneuverable compared to mass-produced frontline mobile suits . It was equipped with a relatively high-output generator , but most of its power was used to fire its abdomen-mounted mega particle gun , whose beam was wide enough and powerful enough to destroy several mobile suits with a single shot . The Sazabi 's armament was rounded out by a pair of beam sabers , a large shield carrying three missiles and a large , hand-carried beam tomahawk , and a beam shotrifle , which operated like a beam rifle version of a shotgun . " <p> " However , the Sazabi was also designed as a Newtype 's weapon . Armed with six remote funnel units , Char could mentally control these weapons at great distances and without the disadvantage of Minovsky particle interference . His funnels were controlled via a fairly standard psycommu ( short for " PSYchic COMMUnicator " ) system , but the Sazabi was also the first mobile suit to feature a revolutionary new piece of Newtype-use technology . This feature was called the " psycoframe " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material composed of microscopic psycommu receptors , thus increasing the pilot 's Newtype sensitivity and responsiveness . Strangely enough , Char - for reasons known only to himself - would authorize Anaheim to pass along the psycoframe technology to the Earth Federation Forces ' Londo Bell taskforce , who had also contracted Anaheim to construct a new Gundam mobile suit to be used by Char 's old rival , Amuro Ray . " <p> " Always having been a soldier who preferred to lead his troops into battle rather than command from the rear lines , Char would deploy quite often in his crimson-red Sazabi during the Second Neo Zeon War that he started when he began bombarding Earth with asteroids in UC 0093 . Soon enough , Char would come up against Amuro Ray in his own psycoframe-equipped mobile suit , the RX-93 n Gundam , and their battle of Newtype minds and mecha would reach its fateful , inevitable conclusion . " <p> Alright ..... back to my little review .... I was rather impressed with the design of the inner metal components with nice mechanical color schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high details in every aspect . <p> Various parts like the head can be lifted open to reveal the inner components of the head , chest , shoulder .. etc . I can easily just sit there and marvel at all the intricate little details . <p> The inclusion of a worker MS was a major plus for me . The previous Formania offering for the Nu Gundam provided some nice little maintenance workers , but the worker MS is so much better , because there are so much detail on this thing too . Like the little mechanical claws and the pilot that can be seen inside the cockpit window . It really compliment the Sazabi bust well . <p> The funnels were also created in great details and can open up to reveal the inner metal components . I just love details and the Formania Sazabi just oozed so much of it . <p> Although the cost of this toy is a rather expensive one , but it is definitely worth every penny of it

@@35099300 @4099300/ <h> Thursday , January 2 , 2014 <h> MG 1/100 Sazabi Ver . Ka - Review by Team GG <p> From a design perspective , this is n't your Yutaka Izubuchis Sazabi . Its received a thorough Hajime Katoki design upgrade . Gone are the smooth , bulbous curves of the CCA version , upgraded with larger proportions and more flat angles . Frankly , it looks amazing . I think its a better example of a modern take than the ver . Ka Nu Gundam or current RX-78-2 . There 's just something stunning about it . <p> Carrying over from the Nu Gundam and new RX-78-2 redesigns are the use of varying colour shades . This time around there are three different shades of red all over the kit that almost make it look like a patchwork creation . In most areas is looks great but there are a few that I feel could have been tuned differently . The net effect though is that the kit looks amazing out of the box . Its something that will look great without any paint or detail work . <p> Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit there are a lot detail lines , extra bits , and areas where the frame is shown through . Well and far beyond most Bandai kits . Unfortunately the inner frame is n't nearly as detailed and , in some areas , seems quite bland . They do spice things up by having multiple silver detail pieces that go between the frame and armor . More on those later . <p> When the Sazabi was fully announced many noticed the hefty price tag . The cost correlates to the size of the kit and the amount of pieces ( over 480 by my count ) , most of which are quite large . The kit itself is quite large all together , standing taller than the formidable MG O. The MG RX-78-2 3.0 only comes up about waist high . <p> During construction most of the kit goes together with ease but there are a few steps that will make you scratch your head . For me it was how the funnels went together and the knee guards which fit into hidden slots after everythings already put together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams created due to the transformation gimmick . The only area where I did have a fit issue was the head .. Its designed so it can be opened up to move the monoeye but , on my kit at least , it never quite fitted together flushly . <p> Note that the kit comes , in traditional ver . Ka fashion , with a good deal of water slide decals . There are also a few stickers for red colour variation like was found on the Nu Gundam ver . Ka . There 's also clear ball cockpit you can use outside of the kit . I took a photo of the damn thing but cant seem it find it right now . <p> Articulation <p> Despite its bulky size , the Sazabi can strike a pose surprisingly well , and hold it too ! A lot of the impressive articulation comes from the shoulder joints which pop out from the torso and offer a fantastic degree of movability . I did n't  have any issues trying to strike a pose with the arms . Nor did I encounter any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The legs are n't  as impressive , but nothing to be scoffed at . Due to the design the armor skirts around the lower leg can impede the feets range of motion . Running poses do n't  look so great due to some of these tighter clearances . To me , however , I consider that an acceptable tradeoff to the benefits of such a large base . The kit is properly large and the wide based feet have no issues supporting her . All of the joints are nice and tight and I had no issues balancing the kit on only one leg . While posing you may find that the large waist skirts get in the way from time to time and may pop off . There is also a small amount of articulation in the torso but nothing to make or break the design . <p> The kit can be held aloft with an action base , but its size and weight makes it awkward to work with . The attachment point is in the back just below the backpack , which unfortunately puts the stand right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sazabi ver . Ka comes with a wide assortment of beam weaponry options , molded straight from the MG Sinanju . Two beam sabers , two short tomahawk effect pieces , and two long tomahawk effect pieces . Is there a better name than beam tomahawk ? Well , that 's what I 'm going with . <p> The Sazabis beam sabers mount in the forearm . Its possible to insert them into the arm and have the beam effect pieces coming out . Unfortunately , unlike the Sinanju , they come out at an odd angle compared to the rest of the forearm itself , making it look awfully awkward . <p> The beam tomahawks are improved over the Sinanju versions and feature a longer handle . They can be held independently , facing opposite directions , or side by side . When side by side there 's a notch in the center to add a beam saber piece as well . Unfortunately it does n't  sit very security and flops to one side or the other . Now that I think of it , based on how the piece is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either way it should be an easy fix . <p> The kit comes with two beam rifles , the one seen in Chars Counterattack and a " Long Beam Rifle " based of off artwork by Hiroyuki Hataike . Both fit in the hands really well and stay in place thanks to the new MG premolded hands and their interconnecting pegs . The long beam rifle is also capable of accepting the Sinanju rocket launcher that comes with the Sinanju OVA version , SInanju Stein , and was released separately prior ( with a magazine or light novel I believe ) . <p> Unfortunately the oversized cuffs and forearms on the Sazabi limit the poses available . The new long rifle at least has an extendable stock that will allow it to clear the forearm . <p> In a perfect universe only the Sazabi would have guns . Unfortunately the Sazabi exists in an imperfect universe and must counter the guns of others . That 's why she 's comes with a big honking shield ! The shield , as large as most mobile suits , matches the aesthetics of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decal , not raised area like the Sinanju kits . <p> The Sazabi does a good job supporting the big and bulky weight of the shield . Its able to spin around and has an added point of articulation that allows it to swing outward , though I 'm not sure the use . The shield hinges near the elbow on a cleverly disguised hard point . There are two other hard points just like it on the forearm but I 'm pretty sure the shield ca n't be attached there because I could never get it hold tight . After the kit has been gone through the transformation gimmick there 's another hard point attached to the shoulder armor which can be accessed . <p> Last but not least , the funnels . <p> The kit comes with a total of six funnels which sit securely in binders coming off the backpack . These binders can open up to release the funnels themselves or just show off a funnel holding mechanism . The construction on funnels themselves is a bit awkward in that the internal parts move up and down between modes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retracted and the thrusters are covered up . When the thrusters are pushed inward the rifle end pokes out as the thruster pushes up on the panels to hold them in their distinctive shape . Unfortunately Bandai did not include any action effect pieces which wouldve been really easy to do . I suspect that they can be easily hand crafted with the right materials . <p> Transformation <p> " One more thing ! " says the man with a bouncers build and an undersized red turtleneck , " Theres a transformation gimmick ! " <p> Part of what makes the Sazabi ver . Ka such a beast is the ability to transform . Its not really a transformation , such as into a plane like numerous other kits , but the ability for armor pieces to move away , arranging and revealing more thrusters . It also reveals a lot of the silver frame details built into the kit . <p> Transforming the kit is amazingly easy . Pull here , pull there , lift that , and you 're done . The only part that 's a bit odd to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flair out so you can see thrusters underneath . For me they never flaired out enough to make them properly visible . You also ca n't really see the thrusters in the front of the legs skirt armor because its high up behind the outer armor . Frankly , I think its just a bit too much . I mean , the kit looks fantastic already without looking fluffed up like a frightened cat . <p> Other Photos <p> At the end of the day , the Sazabi ver . Ka is an impressive kit . It somehow manages to mix traditional Master Grade sensibilities with the unique and innovative engineering ver . Ka kits have come to be associated with . And , very impressively , it joins the ver . Ka ranks as one of the few to not suffer because of it . <p> There will be an inevitable Titanium version of this kit . In a lot of areas Bandai managed to mold the pieces with really small nub connections . In other areas however they 're big and obnoxious , so prepare for an unevent amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , is the Sazabi ver . Ka for you ? This guy is fairly expensive for a MG and I think its definitely worth the price . The amount of detail , the number of pieces , the various display options in this case the cost definitely corresponds to awesomeness . I would not recommend this for novice builders . For the most part things go together really easily . Tons of pieces , but most are large and easy to handle . There just happen to be a few components that seem to awkwardly fit together . They 're just not intuitive and the guide is n't that clear ( probably because I cant read Japanese ) . Moderately experienced builders and above should be able to navigate these little hurdles . <h> 19 comments : <p> Excellent review ! I agree with pretty much everything . This is a wonderful kit , and after having built it , I feel the rest of the MGs feel a bit , well , uneventful ... I can only dream of what the future holds for UC and especially ver Ka kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alex done in this style.I hope this is the start of more reviews from you guys , this is a great addition to the blog ! <p> P.S : the issue with the forearm flaps , they click when you pull them out . To fully reveal the thrusters , you need to click them out twice . They click once to get out , and then move and click just a tiny bit , which is enough to get them flared out all the way . Hope this helps <p> It 's been a while since am actual review of a kit was posted on this blog for GG Infinite . I will admit ( in case anyone does n't know ) , I 'm not a UC fan at all , nor do I have plans to be and get UC kits . Blasphemy , stupid , whatever . =D Just not my thing . <p> Anyway , I will comment that this is a great review . But something I have to question is the end where it was said , " Moderately experienced builders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Is n't this an obvious thing ? Why would anyone in their right mind that is new to GunPla or just experienced with a few SD and HG ( for example ) consider buying the MG Sazabi Ver . Ka thinking that it 'll be a breeze ? <p> Anyway , I think you guys should have compared this guy with kits like MG Nu Gundam Ver . Ka , Sinanju Ver . Ka , Sinanju OVA Ver , MG Sinanju Stein Ver . Ka , etc . At least to give people an idea of how it stacks up with similar kits . I think doing these comparisons between other kits and the kit being reviewed is just something that not many reviewers do . I think it 's useful because it gives perspective and insight into the actual kit relative to others , since people that read the review and might have interest ( for example in this case ) in buying the MG Sazabi Ver . Ka , might have some of the other kits and have recently built it . And giving such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example ) the MG Sazabi Ver . Ka . <p> Anyway , I hope that bit was useful and something you guys could consider in any future reviews posted . Other than that , awesome review . =D <p> A kit must live on its own strengths , not compared with others , and this review is a great showcase of what this kit is . If a person does n't have any of the other kits , then there 's no point in actually reading about these comparisons , is there ? He compares it with The O , which makes sense , being one of the biggest MGs out there , and mentions the 3.0 , which also makes sense , since it 's the standard for gundam sizeIf you 're so concerned about telling others how to review stuff , why do n't you review them yourself ? It would be much better than your endless wishlists and videos of boxes which serve no purpose whatsoever to whomever might be interested in some actual information . Btw , it 's funny that you make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the MG Age-1 , you make no comparisons whatsoever with anything ( proly cuz you never build anything ) . <p> I also wonder why you say you 're not an UC fan and then comment elsewhere the only UC series you 've watched was 08th MS which you did enjoy . I think you just arbitrarily decided you 're not a fan to lend more credibility and self importance to your incredibly irritating arbitrary wishlists . <p> nothing at all in your claims of being a fan of gundam or gunpla feels real , as anyone in the community will tell you . You 're nothing more than an attention whoring hipster loser who thinks he has an opinion on anything , but really has none , and will always be remembered as a balloon full of hot air ... <p> @ Charles " Suiton " Kim Jong UnThere is nothing wrong about not being a UC fan . Nobody forces you to be a part of UC fandom . It 's still your choice to choose your favorite series.The wrong thing is hating a Gundam timeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gundam timeline you are a fan of . And if a newbie builder wanted to buy a Sazabi Ver Ka , then let him do it . He wanted the kit , so let him to buy one . If he do n't know how easy or difficult to buy one , then it 's his problem , which is the problem of some or most Gunpla builders , amateur or veteran . A customer is still in the right mind to buy a kit even he/she is n't sure about the difficulty level of a Gunpla he bought . It depends on his reason : If it is because it is his favorite MS design , then it 's okay . We are free to choose which Gunpla we want to buy.Your hate on UC kits is obvious . First , you criticized Nu Ver Ka 's minor flaws such as the Amuro 's logo not engraved on the shield , which in the CCA movie , it 's not really engraved , it 's painted and the piping on the head ( whatever it is ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fun of Unicorn Gundam and Banshee 's crotches in NT-D Mode . Outside of Gunpla : You underestimate some MS such as The O and the Ex-S Gundam . And now , you think a noob builder is crazy if he immediately bought a Sazabi Ver Ka . as his first MG.If your reason for hating UC is because your favorite Gundam 00 series is not as focused as the UC timeline ( Do n't get me wrong , I 'm also a fan of 00 and the upcoming RG Exia is also a very good news to me ) , then you are the one who is out of your mind . <p> Well suiton many newbies to gunpla have wanted to tackle large projects like PG kits and complex Mg kits . That is why they made the comment about moderate experience builders . But you would n't know this because you have been banned from every legitimate gunpla forum .

Got one and currently building this monster " , <p> While the original design is nothing to sneeze at , this is the one for me ( hence the reason why it 's one of my favorites of 2013 ) .

And speaking of sizes , I wonder if they would ever get around making an MG for fortress-style MSes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Lol that would be the size of a car probably haha . I think Sazabi Ver Ka is roughly the same size as HGUC Psycho Gundam ( I probably am wrong ) . I love Katoki redesigns and this just tops my wildest imagination of my absolute favorite unit . Like the reviewer says ( and I didn'tnknow you hosted OtakuRevolution btw ! ) , it truly is pricey but I find it worth every penny . : ) <p> The Funnels appear to be the exact same ones from the original MG Sazabi . The flaps do n't lock into place or anything so when they are retracted the whole funnel feels flimsy . Hopefully they are n't as much of a pain in the but to get into the backpack as they were with the old kit because of said flimsiness . <p> @jason The Funnel construction is very similar to the original but with one difference : you attach the four flaps onto the " inner frame " of the Funnels instead of attaching it to the big red cylinderical piece like the 2000 one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a wee bit confusing at first . <p> I built the original ( although metallic finish ) , but I only built one Funnel and asked a friend to hold onto it until he can find time to finish the Nu Metallic ( this was in 2011 mind you haha ) . 
@@35099301 @4099301/ <p> First off , I am only going to review the Plot and Characters . I am not picky about animation or music so I feel that it would be pointless for me to try and review those aspects . Second , I 'm going to review each " Generation " separately and than the show as a whole . Each generation was different and had its own pros and cons and can be almost considered their own shows . Note : It may have been a while since I 've seen some of these episodes so do n't expect complete accuracy . <p> Plot : Generation one started off pretty solid with the mysterious UE attacking Nora and Flit using the AGE-1 to defend Nora . However , the Fardain arc was pretty pathetic . It was a pretty drastic shift from UE killing everyone to essentially two clown gangs fighting each other for no reason . Almost everything about Fardain was unnecessary and too out of place . After Fardain , we jumped pretty much back into " War " and the Battle of Ambat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( back to that later ) . The ending could have been better , a simple epilogue by Millais did n't do it justice . Overall , the plot was ok overall , but Fardain really dragged down this generation . <p> Characters : Unfortunately , Flit 's generation saw very few strong characters . Flit and Grodeck are the only two characters I can consider developed . Flit 's transformation as a result of Ambat was Phenomenal and pretty well done . He went from a plucky , smart kid to a heartless , on-edge murderer . Grodeck , a vengeful man because of the murder of his wife and child at the hands of the UE , was also a great character because he was portrayed as resourceful with a no-bullshit attitude . His choice to take all the responsibility for his actions at the end was amazing and only added to his awesomeness . After that , the rest of the cast are incredibly poor . The Diva 's crew had little to no personality , Emily and Dique were incredibly annoying , the Zalam and Euba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Woolf and Desil . Woolf started off as the pretentious Ace pilot but developed into an almost big-brother to Flit . Desil was an insane brat , but he was pretty well-portrayed with spot-on voice acting . <p> Conclusion : Generation One was acceptable , maybe if it had been a full series by itself and many of the characters got more development it could have been better . Too much wasted time in Fardain and lackluster characters ( that do n't even carry on to later seasons ) definitely brought down G1 to a mediocre status . <p> Rating : 6.5/10 <p> Generation 2 : Asemu Asuno <p> Plot : G2 started off on a lighter tone with a focus on Asemu before he really joined the war effort . It was overall just build-up for why Asemu enlisted , to defeat his friend Zeheart . The rest of the season is mostly built around Asemu trying to become better in order to defeat Zeheart and its done pretty well . The conclusion with Asemu finally figuring out his own beliefs was a solid ending . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own accomplishments . <p> Characters : G2 featured a large amount of new faces , as well as a few returning ones . Asemu was a good new character , an impressionable boy learning to discover himself and becoming a man . A lot of his mistakes are the result of his development and I had no problems with it . Zeheart was ok , he was supposed to portray the Vagans as real people ; however , fanaticism for the Vagan cause threw some of that out the window . It was hard to like Zeheart when he always seemed so calm and distant . As for the rest of the new cast , I could care less about 80% of the Federation , the few exceptions being Obright and Romi . Likewise for the Vagan , the Magicians 8 had very little character because they were killed off soon after introduction and the rest of the new Vagans seemed as emotionless as ever . <p> As for the returning cast , some of were great , some pointless . Flit as an adult was amazing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodical . He had his moments where you could see his hatred appearing but it was always kept subtle . Woolf 's return as Asemu 's mentor and father-figure was also great . From my perspective , he was that cool , older brother you always wanted . Unfortunately , besides those two , the rest of the returning cast was lackluster or downright useless . Grodeck was unceremoniously killed off , Emily is even more useless than she was in G1 , Dique is still a joke , Millais has no personality , and Desil was just psychotic without any of the appeal he had in G1 . <p> Conclusion : G2 overall was an improvement over G1 . A more consistent plot and a couple strong characters really helped the show find solid ground . There was n't as much wasted time as G1 , but again , many of G2 's characters were unlikable and poorly done . If there was more time to help develop the supporting cast , than G2 could have been an outstanding series ( Hm , sounds familar ) . <p> Rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ok , this is where things get out of control and I think the writers forgot what they were doing . There are many parts in the plot that feel like rather than working in an event into the story in a good way , the writers simply shoe-horned them in and hoped they were n't awful . First example is Shanalua , a character that is built up 2-3 episodes prior to her inglorious death , a death that had little to no impact on viewers . Back to the beginning , Asemu 's random disappearance after his character finally clicked was questionable . It became ridiculous when he returned out of nowhere as a space pirate and a different set of beliefs ( I 'll come back to this ) . Than came the introduction of the EXA-DB , something that was never even mentioned until now and is supposedly the most important thing to ever exist . After that was the Second Moon arc ... , dear god that arc was almost as bad as Fardain . Here is where the writers shoe-horned another character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped would have an impact on viewers . Again , it failed . Not only that but they threw out all chances of Vagans being acceptable when they turned Ezlecant into a comic book villian ( again , I 'll come back ) . Kio than took all of his experiences and his new gundam and went the pacifist route , which was expected . This than carried into the Battle of Luna where there was another shoe-horned character who gets killed off in 2 episodes , Girard Spriggan , another failure . Finally , the Battle of La Gramis . This is where G3 both excelled and fell short . Many members of the support cast get their time to shine and do n't disappoint ( Seric and Obright ) . However , what could have been an amazing final battle is ruined by the fact that they try to tie up too many loose ends in too short of time . Some characters who have been built up for a while ( Zeheart and Zanald ) , are just killed off without any real effect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind so easily and Zera Gins and Shido being defeated pretty effortlessly . The epilogue itself seemed like a last minute addition . It stated/showed very little and felt pretty empty . G3 was such a chaotic season that its very hard to praise outside of a handful of moments . <p> Characters : Simply put , a lot of awkward characters . Many of the new characters lacked any spotlight or development unless they were to be killed off the next episode , thereby nullifying their development ( Shanalua , Lu , Girard ) . A portion of the other characters received nothing ( Bisidians , Diva 's " problem " crew , Leil , Wendy , Zera ) . Another part got some development but resulted in nothing of value ( Zanald , Anis , Wootbit ) . Thankfully , some characters like Fram , Seric , and Obright got plenty of character development and were rewarded with amazing and memorable scenes . <p> Onto the " Main " cast . Kio was overall a decent character . Many of his decisions are questionable and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character was acceptable . His pacifist personality was still a bit preachy , but it was portrayed pretty well . His fighting style was n't ridiculous like Kira 's in the freedom , and he was n't a hypocrite like Kira . Kio chose not to kill and he never betrayed that decision . He was still a pretty flawed character , but I found him to be acceptable . <p> Asemu 's return as a space pirate was way out of left field . He ended his generation as a proud man with a firm understanding of who he was . To suddenly become a pirate with a whole new set of beliefs was ridiculous and completely uncalled for . This sudden change drops some of Asemu 's appeal and damaged his character . <p> Flit 's return as a cranky , genocidal grandpa was to be expected . Overall , it was maintained pretty well . He continued to be determined to wipe Vagans out of the universe up until the last ten minutes of the show .... All it took was his grandson begging and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn completely 180 . It would have been much better if it was n't so sudden and drastic . The whole " becoming a savior of all " thing did help redeem it a bit in my eyes . <p> Ezlecant .... , I had hopes that Ezlecant was finally going to make the Vagans likeable , but the fact that they made him into a genocidal utopian turned that hope into dust . How can anyone like the Vagans when they 've only been portrayed as mindless , ruthless zealots . <p> Zeheart .... , now this is where an ok character went to absolutely absurd . Zeheart was an acceptable character in G2 , and started off decently in G3 . He was played up as a caring commander who genuinely took care of his subordinates . That all flew out the window when he conformed to Ezlecant 's plan . He threw away all of his beliefs , which had been built up for ten or so episodes , like it was nothing . Another complete 180 of a character for no good reason . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> Almost all the characters of G3 were flawed in some way , either they were under developed , developed and did nothing , or developed in the completely wrong direction . I have no idea what the writers were thinking when they ruined so many potentially good characters . <p> Conclusion : This was very depressing . G1 and G2 had their problems but were pretty solid overall , they had promise that was only ruined by G3 . The horrible pacing , weak characters , and all around chaos leaves G3 as the worst of the 3 generations . Its flaws definitely outweigh its good moments . Everything felt wrong , wasted , or unfinished . Once again , if the show had been given more time to develop its plot/characters , maybe it would n't have been the mess it is . <p> Rating : 5/10 <p> Gundam AGE : Overall <p> Plot : AGE started off pretty rocky but eventually found some solid ground at the end of G1 . G2 managed to keep this going throughout its season and ended on a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that quickly disappeared . I believe most Gundam series are defined by their last 10 or so episodes . Unfortunately , AGE 's last 10 were pretty pitiful . So much potential was wasted on pointless arcs and time wasted on weak characters that could have been spent building and reinforcing existing plot points and characters . <p> Characters : Across three generations we received a flood of pointless , unlikable characters . Many characters were also very poorly handled and robbed of all potential . If time had been managed better or if each season was longer , we would n't have had so many pointless characters and weak , potentially good characters . <p> The Asuno family itself was pretty good . In my eyes , Flit was the main character of all three generations . The show essentially followed his descent into madness at the hands of the Vagan . He is a phenomenally strong character that I genuinely enjoyed following . Asemu was also a great character , only his sudden shift between seasons keeps him from being an overall solid character . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . Many of his actions and decisions cause his character to suffer . It also does n't help that his season was overall poorly written . Perhaps if his season was done better , than his flaws would n't appear so significant . <p> Conclusion : The idea of having a cross-generation Gundam series had incredible potential and was interesting . Unfortunately , it did n't work out like it could have . Squandered time and characters all culminated in a poorly handled series . AGE does have some moments where it shined , but overall it was a very poor attempt at something new . With that said , I still enjoyed watching it on a week to week basis . Will I re-watch anytime in the near future ? Definitely not . Do I think its the worst series ? No , some of its better moments help keep it relatively afloat in my eyes . I 'll probably go back and watch some of its better moments from time to time and try to ignore its massive flaws . Gundam AGE is most definitely not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " skip . " Watch it if you want , but take it with a grain of salt and do n't be too disappointed if you 're not a fan . <p> Final Rating : 6.5/10 <p> Thank you for reading my review of Gundam AGE ! Sorry if its a bit wordy and chaotic , I 'm a rather poor writer . Also , please understand that this is my opinion . If you do n't agree , than you do n't have to listen to me. <h> 22 comments : <p> That pretty much sums up most people 's opinions , nice work . You forgot to mention the terrible MS designs of the vagans in G3 . They seemed to be getting more ridiculous with every passing episode except for a few like the Legilis . Does anyone know if the director or writer changed in this arc or something ? <p> Good review . I could n't have worded it better . As much as the series was faulted , it did n't feel like a chore to finish ( despite getting exponentially confused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to me like it went too fast . Granted it was about 13 episodes , but it felt like it was just the first 13 episodes of a different series . I agree that the AGE-2 arc was the better part of the series . However , if Age-3 's arc was supposed to portray the chaos of war , as it seemed to imply , it was handled rather chaotically , and felt cluttered and unorganized . <p> Now that it is done , I do n't  have much intention to watch it again as well . If I were , I would do as stated earlier and make it into a drinking game . Here 's a rule : Take a sip everytime Girard Spriggan 's name is said . <p> For now , I still wait for Episode 6 of Unicorn , and anticipate for what they do with Gundam : The Origin . <p> weirdest thing of all was how the second moon could have moved away from mars the entire time and escaped those mars rays.and how the epilogue spoke as if the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space properly . <p> At the ending , they mention that some population go back to living around Mars again which I find it weird . What 's the point of going backwhen there is nothing worthful on Mars . Unless they are living on Mars surface and terraforming it , if they still live in colony around Mars , might as well live in new colony around Earth . Initially when Mars was mentioned in the story , I was hoping that a Gundam series finally will have the chance to include people living ON the surface of Mars , which will be interesting . <p> One thing I will mention though is the EXA-DB was not entirely out of nowhere , it was hinted at alot in Gen 1 and alot of viewers ( and perhaps some characters ) had suspicions this was the cause of the UE advanced tech , Gen 3 is when it made its official debut <p> u rite bout all logic plotbut i think u missed bout character feels.i do n't  think Asemu ' come out of nowhere ' because he stil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Filt n Asemu finaly talk face by face on a sofa .. Asemu being a pirate TO PROTECT , the same faith he ad in G2And bout Zeheart change of heart , of course , people can forgot who they are n suddenly turn into others kind of people just because one turning point . <p> This review wraps up pretty much everything about this anime . I feel in some way Bandai wanted to target a family show instead of just kids . It would only be the reasonable choice if we take a look at the past decade with GS GSD and 00 . The show really had a lot of potentials , but I feel that the writers and animators were affected by the initial reaction too much . They panic and did n't know what to write about by middle of G2 , causing G3 to be a complete mess . <p> I think the anime should have taken more on the approach of focusing more on family problems since the show is targeted for that audience . By making the secondary characters more solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main characters to develop properly . <p> The concept of this show was great , besides the god-like age system . However , I feel like since the show is spanned across 100 and the universe is called Advance Generation , they seem to have missed the point of ' Advance ' . G1 was good , because it was where we were introduced to everything , but 25 years later , are they really still using the Deva ? I feel there was absolutely no advancement in technology and very few for mechanical design as well . <p> The show obviously wanted to promote a strong sales line of kits , which I must say the kits were a big step up . G1 was obviously not going to do well with the kits , thanks to its ' amazing ' designs ( age-1 ) . I was extremely disappointed by the lack of advancement in the mecha design in G2. 25 years later and all that was changed from the zedas to zedas-r and m was a color scheme on the shoulder ... <p> Overall the show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after that , there really was nothing much that was appealing . <p> I have to admit the Plot of Generation 3 was full of unneeded stuff like Spriggan , but the part of Kio being a held in Veigan was a necessary part in my opinion . There was showed how they live and that was sth . I would know since Generation 2 . <p> Flit was great in all three Generations , but his last ten Minutes of screentime were too forced . His sudden change was ... silly ? Asemu was great in every aspect . Not much to say.Kio being a pacifist ... I think its not possible to be one and fight in a Gundam at the same time so this was sth. that I hated in Seed , too ( Dontt get me wrong , I liked Seed ) . At first he was a great little Pilot , later ... But overall I think Kio was right in fighting without killing , so far its possible without endangering his own companions . <p> The other characters ... Some I liked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more growth . <p> All in all I like Gundam AGE and will rewatch it in the near future . And if possible I will buy it , too . <p> So now you AGE-haters can go on and bitch a little like you always do , but do know : I give shit on your opinion . <p> Awesome review ! I beg to disagree with the scores though but that 's purely objective so no issues there . <p> I just think G1 should have scored at least an 8 for that wonderful ending and Fardain was really not that bad but was essential with the plot too . The build up was to have that impact on Flit being that " Savior " uniting humanity .... And them " clowns " the needed manpower to go against vagan . <p> G2 was the best for me . The drama was more intense with Flit leading Earth , Asemu 's frustrations with his father on how to please and live up to people 's expectations , Woolfe showing his human side not just an ace war machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the unsung hero Grodek got out of the prison at that day and age he really did not have a place on the crew . The spy role and death really had meaning . Earth was just , if not , a lot rotten than vagans . <p> G3 was a bit hard to swallow . Flit being gramps but still in action was awesome . Asemu is a pirate ! And Kio felt like Kamille Vidan . Start was good but it did n't get thrilling from there not until asemu came back and went a bit downhill again after a few eps . Now , Flit did NOT change his mind so easily at the end mind you . Kio had been building up that " GRAMPS ! STOP ! THE VAGAN ARE HUMANS TOO ! " effort . Just look up how torn Flit was after when the three main characters clashed their ideas speaking face to face at ep . 44 tackling about Flit 's intent on using the Plasma driver . Somehow kio managed to get through flit , probably because they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IYKWIM kinda helped as flit saw Urine i mean Yurin and the others which he " was not able to protect " forgive him . <p> But yeah , all in all your review was pretty accurate and i most agree with your input for G3. i just wish there were no scores as it would raise a few eyebrows and tend to spark the purist fans and haters alike . i wonder what / how can something be a " perfect " 10. bottom line : AGE is far from being the blacksheep / bastard child of the Gundam franchise so bombers , please go somewhere else . cheers ! : D <p> G1 in my opinion is better because not just the strong characters but as well as having elements similar to that of Gundam X ( Yurin and Grodek ) and G Gundam ( Spallow and Titus ) despite being a tribute to the UC series . G2 is more like Gundam Seed and G3 being Victory Gundam/08th ms team/Seed Destiny/Crossbone . <p> Pretty much it . I really liked AGE , but I must admit most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually liked Asemu in gen 3 . He seemed to have it " together " more than the others , and I felt like it continued his character pretty well . Other than that , great review . <p> The review was spot on for the most part but I strongly disagree with gen 2 having the lead on gen 1 . Gen 1 , aside from fardain , had very balanced character development for everyone . The assault on ambat was spectacular with outgunned and technologically inferior suits fighting against the UE . You could also see the desparation and brutality of hand to hand combat . <p> Gen 2 started off well but it started suffering from Seed syndrome from the suspicious colony episode onwards where grunts would stand around getting shot instead of trying to dodge . Asemu 's continued rank subordination also dragged things down and characters like Millias were completely forgotten . I find it surprising that people would rank gen 2 so highly because the characters were older but many times they acted less mature than in gen 1 . Story was also less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it me or for the past few Gundam series , they have many cool ideas and potential , with good start but as the as the series progress , it went downhill and end up lots of people disappoint at the ending of the series . By the way , I think it will be great idea to design a Gundam unit specially fitted with weapons that immobilized enemy MS ( electric net launcher or something ) if they want to have a pacifist piloting it thus bring true potential of a Gundam without killing enemy . <p> I am a big fan of Flit and Asemu , ( as of the models I only have the AGE-1 and AGE-2 Normals ) , and if you ask me , I wish G2 would have a spinoff where you start at the end of G2 and have it end until Asemu gets his ass kicked by SID . I 'd give it a title of Gundam AGE SP ( for Special Forces , Super Pilot , or Space Pirate ) . <p> The series does feel slow at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first generation throughout the second generation . The third one ruined it for me . <p> This review hit the nail on the head . Simply put , Sunrise took a risk , but it did n't pay off as intended . Age had potential , but it was n't carried out properly . Do n't get me wrong , from what I 've seen of Age I 've enjoyed . I 'm Just happy that we got a new Gundam series , and ca n't every real Gundam fan be happy with that ? I 'm not gon na say that age is the worst or the best as every gundam series has its specific strengths and weaknesses . The Gundam franchise is a timeless classic , and we should n't diss a new Gundam series because someone wanted to do a different take on classic tale of the hell that war is . In the end , we should all look on the bright side : We now get to look forward to the next Gundam series . I know I 'm excited for it , is anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs , which had been built up for ten or so episodes , like it was nothing . Another complete 180 of a character for no good reason . I ca n't find anything redeeming about Zeheart 's character at this point . " I think you missed he part when Zeheart desperately said : " I wanted to make Lord Ezlecant 's dreams come true . Otherwise , I do n't know what else I 've been living for . " Learning that Ezlecant had been deceiving him all this time really put a huge blow on Zeheart . He was oscillating but ultimately became desperate to make it true anyway out of despair . <p> I 'm of the unpopular opinion who REALLY liked Gundam Age . I definitely agree with what every flaw people saw but I just liked it , you know . I skipped a lot of boring parts so maybe that 's why I ended up enjoying it way more . I did n't have to sit through some shit xD 
@@35099303 @4099303/ <p> Well what ca n't I say about this ? To me it evokes an image of Kamen Rider x Gundam and is instantly bad as hell . The custom claw and the back mounted katana seal the deal of an immaculate and incredibly detailed paint job . The custom colour scheme shows deliberate and careful planning down to the shade of each colour , the grey and red face , and the prep work beneath the metallics . There is nothing there that does not work in complete harmony in my opinion . The gold panel lines simply blow my mind with their intricacy and perfection and really tie everything together nicely . The photography demonstrates and attention to composition and positioning and as such it is very difficult to pick any flaws . If I had one critique it would be that I 'd have loved to have seen a few more markings but it certainly gets by fine without them .

@@35099305 @4099305/ <p> Nathaniel Barrera has been one of the best in the Philippines for 9 - 10 years now ? His detailing style and his hangar dioramas has been good and consistent for years . He has always been fond of detail painting small added details thus giving his finished mechs a very colorful vibrant look . Needless to say , the kits in this diorama are masterfully built , LED works on the hangar looks great , poses of the mech and the angle of photography is convincingly realistic and the small details like the running figures completed the look . <p> However , the Cutting board as part of the background is a letdown . An almost PRO looking presentation , then you see a cutting board as background . <p> Good building technique for models ? Check . Great color selection ? Check . Creative posing ? Check . Random civilians running around like most Gundam series ? Check . I love it ! This hangar diorama is well crafted and brilliantly executed , including the lighting . The cutting board I think was a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos to a photo based contest . I also believe there should be more damage to the hangar around the back area where the Zaku has been toppled . <p> Great colour schemes on the GM 's and a high level of detail are the winners for me here . The subtle differences in the paint schemes set the GM 's apart while still making them look part of a team . The angle of the first photo is what sells me on this dio and is very much from the perspective of a human scaled viewer . The people fleeing in terror are what make it come to life . I 'd have liked to have seen composition that included all of the models without cutting any parts off . Whilst the lighting omits some detail that I would have liked to see more of , it certainly adds to the frightening vibe of this dio . Very intimidating poses and a very well executed diorama .

BURN ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> lastly , the head . my guts and feeling after looking the head is confused . the v-fin , i do n't  know how to say it , DIFFERENT than the MG. that 's my gut tells me.the eye i think is covered in very transparent clear plastic in front of it , judging by the light reflection on it.the turrets , finalllyyyyy ! ! ! the MG version really suck with it , so finally we have a decent turrets on the head . <p> I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we see such inner frame and the mechanisms that hold the knee , joints and shoulders we can easily compare it to the MG .... after all you did say it " looks very identical to the Master Grade in terms of outer form " . <p> yeah , it will all comes clear in 11/21it looks identical for outer frame , but what more can u do with it ... ? even if i were the lead mechanic designer for the PG , the MG is already enough for white panel design in the outer frame so i would just do better panel line with it and make it more STEADY than the the MG . <p> if u guys expecting the outer frame in the PG would be like PG Strike etc , then u are dreaming ... it 's next to impossible to do that while separating white panel for transformation and the space for LED unit in that ... <p> the outer frame design for PG Unicorn would be closer to the original design , just like PG RX-78-2 , Zeta , MkII , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third Form " is just like the maintenance mode for older PG , with some of the outer frame can be opened like getting maintenance or something . <p> The LED , not all that impressive i must say , compared to my possibilities for the LED earlier . Nothing that i resent , i 'd still buy it tho lol <p> Then again , after looking the latest picture , this PG is just like heaven and hell between the MG version . Truly fits the PG line . Looks solid enough , plenty gimmicks to play , and great on the shelves too lol <p> Lastly , the FA expansion . I 'm not hellbent over the expansion , but Bandai ... really ? P-Bandai ... ? And i looked it not really fit the PG-like details on it ... I 'm currently thinking if it would be worth to buy it or not at ALL ... <p> Still it 's a PG , so damn right i 'd buy all the stuff of it ( except the FA , think twice first ) lol <p> Actually guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that they just give you an option to switch on the LEDs while it 's in Unicorn mode and called it a " pre-Destroy mode " , or NT-D start-up mode or something , or maybe it 's a burst mode like Quanta has . <p> Either way , I 'm pretty much off put by the head right now since it does n't look mean enough ! Hopefully an image from a better perspective comes out ....... or I 'll just make sure it stays in Unicorn mode when it 's out . <p> hm , not a bad thought i must saytheres ton of possibilities for the " Third Mode " so we will be teased for the rest of this month till 11/21curse you , bandai , for giving us this new kind of PG teaser different than the other PG advertisement style ... <p> Have to agree with you on that about the third mode and these are still images before the final product so hopefully they will make the unicorn head more dynamic and mean looking . Also hope for some green psycho frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands and knees for a PG BANSHEE <p> Am sold for the Mobile Suit , but for the LEDs am still not impressed . If the LED set just consists of 30 UV SMDs , then no way . I 'll be cancelling the preorder for it and just order 100 SMDs for 5$ on Ebay.But the PG Unicorn is just WOW ! ! Your money is ready BANDAI . It would have been nice if the parts came as in the video , but I do n't think so , lolz ! ! <p> I 'm actually surprised that we have n't gotten any word on a possible next PG kit . I mean Unicorn is great and all and it 's cool that it has an LED set and not that cool with the Full Armor being an add on set ... I 'm just surprised it was n't a smaller guy like Exia or 00 Qant . Those 2 would 've been an awesome choice . <p> What the hell is wrong with you ? Do you have some sort of mental condition or are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of announcement for the next PG when the Unicorn has n't been released yet ? Do you have any clue how long it 's been since we had a PG release ? Why the hell would bandai make a stupid decision and release a PG exia or qant ? Unicorn is one of the most recent series and highly popular it should be the newest PG . Hell Bandai apparently did n't even see either of those designs worthy of being a PG release when OO was airing . There 's no need to start now . Let 's by releasing the PG unicorn it 's a given we will see a PG Banshee in the future with the Born parts as a exclusive . <p> dun say that you are not surprised , just be blunt and say that you wish . Really , how many pg kits do u think they announce in a year ? strike freedom was 3 years ago . Unicorn announced in september this year , and u want them to announce another . Wow , can i be ur girlfriend ? cuz u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oh man , it might be the hype , but I definitely prefer the proportions of the PG Destroy Mode to the MG 's . It has a lot more panel line details and has more gimmicks . If you 're fine with the MG that 's awesome too , a testament to Bandai 's engineering , but this PG looks too clean to pass up for me : ) <p> Which MG Unicorn do you have that is n't a brick ? IS there an unknown release that can actually bend its knees or elbows past 45 degrees ? Unless you have a MG kit that is unlike the ones that have been publicly available you really ca n't consider this just a bigger MG ... <p> are you retarded ? how is it so when it has better joint articulation , i mean dude you 're judging based on this , wait for the kit reviews from consumers man . And what 're you expecting , for it to look a lot more different than the MG ? <p> Do ypu even own the MG ? ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the MG , also there are lot more panel and weapons options everywhere . I guess you 're just an idiot that speak and never buy something . Bandai do n't need your money , chill down . <p> This is what you call perfect well-proportioned great detail there 's nothing more I could ask for , It 's like following the path of pg strike evolve look loving that destroy unchained mode this kit is a must buy thumbs up Bandai ! <p> Many of you guys are disappointed because of the external design of the PG being too close to the MG design . But of you will look closer , try to compare it to the MG , you would appreciate the small details from the panel lines to the armor separation . Yes there 's no big difference like that of the MG strike and its PG counter part but the design of the Mg Unicorn Gundam is already too complex to make major customization . If you want more details then you could just customize it . What matters most is the articulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are complaining about this PG Unicorn . PG Unicorn is clearly better than MG in any ways . Just the proportion itself is a big win ! Do a close comparison , MG 's head is way too small and the legs are way too long in destroy mode . How is PG being too close to the MG design ? They are both based on the same mobile suit ! It would be really hard for them to sell this model if they change too much or adding too much details which may not be in someone 's taste ( Heck ! People are already complaining about the 3rd form for not being impressive already ) Stay close to the original ! I do n't understand why people are thinking " the head does n't look mean enough " I mean com'on look at it ! The head looks exactly as it is in the OVA or even the beautiful box art . What else do you want ? ! Modified it if you are not happy with it . Do n't have the skill ? Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the extra details is enough and just right . Plus , the LED light is a dream come true ! If Bandai did n't make the LED people is going to complain : " Why 00 raiser has LED , this one does n't ? I will only buy it if it comes with LED " I remember when someone modified the HG Unicorn with light up LED posted on Youtube . OMG ! That was the prettiest thing I have ever seen ! Bandai now give us the option , I am grateful ! Keep in mind . None of our models cost much to make , material wise . Most of the money they are asking for are the amount of time and the design they have spend and come up with . I personally do n't think this PG Unicorn would be PERFECT without the light up feature . Ha ! You call a Destroy mode Unicorn a PERFECT unicorn without glowing psycho frame ? <p> many common people ranting on and on again how it was MG ripoff , but not with us who really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fun building it ! <p> maybe you all who complain never really appreciated the joy of building gunpla or other plamo ... <p> the PG line is supposed to show the world new gimmicks/technology in building gunpla or plamothis is the sole reason Bandai let us enjoy and have new fun ways to built <p> if you are not going to buy , then so be it . but if you are going to complain how the design sucks or yadda-yadda-yadda , then you must feel how the designers really put their hearts designing this kit and also to other kits <p> if you wan na complain again , please read/watch the review later on then figure out if it 's worth or notto complain when all you do is just bitching around when you do n't  actually built it by yourself ... really to be ashamed for all of us builders ... <p> On top of all of that , you all have to realize . 1 ) The MG and PG line are both used to develop each other . MGs are used to develope their PG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its all in the history of gunpla. 2 ) Bandai does n't make these products for any one specific person . For those of you complaining , did you personally call Bandai and ask them to develop a model kit for you ? If you did , then you 're a self serving idiot who does n't deserve to call yourself a modeller . These products are built for the masses . NOT YOU ! The world of plamo is bigger than you so get over yourself . If you 're a fan , them be a fan . If not , then suck it up and wait for somthing else . But do n't rip on someones hard work because they did n't do what YOU wanted . I dare ANY of you that complain , to design a Gundam , engineer the materials and instructions so you have a model kit and see how everyone reacts to it . I guanrantee that you will be disappointed by how many people will hate your shit . So get over yourselves . <p> I think these transforming videos might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until i saw that i suffered from some of the same issues as the mg . Namely the shoulders and arms not having that comfortable sweet spot of force when transforming them . Now since it will be my first pg i 'm a little on the fence between this or the more mechanical aspected Mk II <p> Although I 've already pre-ordered it , I have to say it 's lack of details even compare to the RGs .. kinda understand why people saying it 's like a MG . It will be a different story if with the LED unit though .. The size + the 32 LED units looks amazing . However the kit itself is not that impressive , though the proportion will be much better than the MG and GFFMC . <p> Bandai are forcing you to get the LED unit in order to make the whole purchase meaningful . <p> What details ? Unicorn are designed without excessive detail on first place , and even other than strike other PGs did n't have excessive details like RGs . Do n't compare PG with RG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I know that having a new PG kit is a huge thing as they are very scarcely made but is it really necessary to have it showcased on your website almost every day ? I have actually grown tired of seeing Unicorn at this point because whenever I check the new updates from this site each day during down time at my job , the first thing I usually see is the PG Unicorn.Even one of my friends who is a huge fan of Unicorn Gundam has grown tired of seeing it every time he logs onto this site . <p> I 'm not trying to start any arguments but this is just my honest opinion right here . I apologize if I have offended or annoyed some of you by just stating my opinion on the constant updating of the PG Unicorn . <p> I 've pre-ordered it with the LED unit but only half of all that pre-ordered here in Thailand will get it this December ... Distributor says something about the LED units being defective .... Hope everything goes well .. 
@@35099310 @4099310/ <p> I would have to agree with DC that the panel lining is crisp and possibly due to a clever photographic angle it is pretty difficult to spot a nub mark . I could only see one on the skirt , which is ultimately what made the decision for me . This was a very difficult category to judge with by far the most entries of all 5 categories , so in the end it did come down to scrutinizing very minor flaws .

@@35099317 @4099317/ <p> The RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 02 " Banshee " Spoilers Beware ( aka Banshee ) is a mobile suit that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn . It is the sister unit of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam , built alongside the Unicorn under the Earth Federation 's UC Project . The unit was originally piloted by Marida Cruz , but was later assigned to Riddhe Marcenas of the Earth Federation . ( via Gundam Wiki ) <p> After its completion alongside the Unicorn Gundam , the Banshee was stationed on Earth by the Augusta Research Lab and tested for atmospheric combat . Rather than that of a Unicorn , the Banshee 's motif is that of a lion , illustrated with gold accents on the forehead , a golden collar to signify a lion 's mane , and a much more elaborate horn/V-fin . <p> The Banshee 's armor is all-black and its psychoframe emits a golden-orange glow when the NT-D is activated , giving it the nickname " psychoflame " . Although the Banshee lacks the Unicorn 's distinctive La+ System , its performance in atmospheric combat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusters and propellant storage , or a significan reconfiguring of the suit 's operating system to account for Earth 's gravity and the atmosphere 's frictional resistance . <p> Combat improvements were made according to Unicorn Gundam 's battle data , which had been relayed to the Augusta Research Lab . However , the two Gundams have no major operating differences . Aside from lacking the Unicorn 's La+ operating system , the Banshee 's raw performance is equal to that of the Unicorn . In other words , any modification to the Banshee ( i.e. atmospheric combat performance ) could also be applied to the Unicorn , making both suits equal in ability . ( via Gundam Wiki ) <p> The horns are pretty fragile , and one must be careful when moving the head around . For those thinking to sharpen the horns will have some work ahead of them , as there is a total of nine horns . <p> Upper Torso <p> Armed Armor VN <p> A weapon featured only on the OVA version , The Armed Armor VN is a Psycoframe-embedded destructive vise-like weapon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is treated with beam-resistant coating and can also be used as a shield or striking weapon when deactivated . <p> The High Grade iteration of the Armed Armor VN is not as functional as it might look in the image . The Armed Armor VN is actually just 2 pieces of claw parts that attach to both side of the left arm . And the claw does not open / close , is just a static part . And it can be detached , so that the arm becomes the normal Banshee 's arm . <p> Armed Armor BS <p> A weapon featured only in the OVA version . A Psycoframe-embedded long-range beam smart gun , it is capable of extremely accurate firing , achieved by a special sensor unit transmitting data to the pilot via Psycommu system and using the pilot 's reaction to synchronize the beam-directing " fins " . Similiar to the Armed Armor VN , the Armed Armor BS are two pieces of plastic attach to each side of the arm . <p> Waist <p> Legs <p> The angle at which the knees can bend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not possible . <p> The backpack is the same in design as the original Unicorn Gundam Destroy Mode .

So do becareful when you build yours . <p> When the Armed Armor VN &amp; the Armed Armor BS are detached , the kit can be outfitted with the regular Unicorn Gundam armnaments with the Beam Magnum &amp; Shield . <p> The kit comes with an extra cartridge of Beam Magnum ammo , which can be attached to the back waist skirt . <p> Four beam sabers are the standard number of beam sabers for the Unicorn Gundam .

Is not often that a HGUC kit looks as detailed as the Banshee . The amount of accessories is more than your usual HG gunpla kit , but the Armed Armor VN &amp; BS left a lot to be desired , perhaps an MG iteration of the Banshee would fill this gap . And the exclusion of the pink beam saber parts baffles me . Articulation is pretty standard , but I did noticed that the angle with which the knee can bend is pretty limited . But I guess is not a deal breaker . All in all , the Banshee is a pretty detailed HGUC kit with an awesome color theme and look quite menacing standing on your desk .

@@35099325 @4099325/ <p> I believe you assume correctly , Anon ; it 's very doubtful that a game based on an unpopular franchise will make it over to North America ( or at least the U.S. ) . The last time the Gundam Vs. series made it overseas to over here was with Gundam vs . Zeta Gundam ; basically Fed vs . Zeon and AEUG vs . Titans in one using the old engine , and it was panned . It 's probably an understatement since Bandai did n't even try porting future games over at all ( Gotcha Force not counting , even if it used the new engine the newer Gundam vs. games use ) . <p> Not to mention that GEV is currently over a hundred dollars in our currency . Even if the Yen was equal to a Penny , it 'd still be expensive . <p> I 'm surprised there was even an attempt to port over the Gundam Musou trilogy of games , even if it 's just Dynasty Warriors with a Gundam theme . I do n't think they 're doing great with those , either .

This show is decent but way too over priced . <p> Because home video has always been expensive in Japan . People continue to pay the prices and therefore Bandai charges it .

Oh well . At this rate , MG Sandrock Custom will probably be P-Bandai too . I guess it should be expected since Gundam Wing was not the best series in Japan .

The cost correlates to the size of the kit and the amount of pieces ( over 480 by my count ) , most of which are quite large .

I 'm sorry wallet , this is going to hurt ........ a lot . <p> Who wants to bet that the HD Sword and Launcher will just be recolours ? I honestly ca n't see Bandai releasing them online only given the amount of new parts they would have . If they were new they would have more than enough to release them as their own thing akin to the Skygrasper in Real Grade . The fact they are online only makes me think they will some new decals and a richer colour and that will be it . <p> Of course I could be completely wrong . But we are n't talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly made for Nu , nor the Wings of Light for Destiny which are twi think slices of plastic . Both the sword and the canon , as well as the shoulder armour , are all fairly large , and since online exclusives either tend to have very minor new parts and/or are just recolours I just ca n't see them making so many new molds for an online exclusive . <p> I think though that the proportions on the old strike packs are completely different ( like the shoulder , it 's different altogether ) so i do n't think it 'll be the same thing as before . However , they might just remake the shoulder point , but keep the old weapons ... Who knows , either or , it 's going to be a pain in the ass to get it . <p> Someone should make a stop motion energizer bunny commercial out of this kit .

We also do n't know if it includes the Skygrasper . We also do n't know if it has an MG Strike HD Ver . included in this set . <p> Sadly no .

By the way , I saw a blue winged version so ... I 'm not sure which is official . I agree the wings do look a bit " janky " . <p> I 'd say it 's more V2 's energy " wings of light " rather than Wing Zero 's . The model would look much better if the wings were just 1 solid wing rather than it rotating on a joint like that . And yes , transparent blue/white wings would look much better . Not too fond the wings of the new build fighter , though it might look better directly attaching the light wings to it . It seems to also have a shoulder cannon that can swivel out from its back and over its shoulder ( like gundam x ) . Been wondering about Gundam X Maoh 's secret though ..

@@35099345 @4099345/ <h> RG 1/144 Freedom Gundam - Images &amp; Review by Gundam Guy <p> I 've caught a bad cold .. so I stayed home and took a little time to take some images of the my straight build RG 1/144 Freedom Gundam which is being released in Japan today . So Instead of a wordy review , I will just let the images do most of the talking , and provide my thoughts here and there about this latest RG release . <p> After I finished assembling the kit and playing around with it a bit , I must say that this is the first RG kits that felt sturdy , and not as flimsy as the previous 4 RGs . I can play around with the RG Freedom by doing various poses and the kit holds up nicely with hardly any parts fell off ( well , maybe the wing did fall off 1 or 2 times ) , but still the overall build is very solid . <p> Probably the only minor negative for this kit is that the wings have a serious weight issue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached . The RG Aile Stike barely got by standing on its own with a wide leg stance , but the RG Freedom 's wing is so much more heavier even the upper torso get dragged backwards over time . I used a Tamashii Stand Act 4 to support the upper torso for display , and I think it is definitely better than using an Action Base . But I guess the weight issue is expected from most winged mobile suit gunplas ... so no biggie . <p> Another minor negative about the wings is that when you play around with it ( moving the wings a lot ) , the wing could become loosen and wing plates might fall off . But this rarely happened . <p> The shoulder joints can be extended outward to allow the arms to have much more articulations than previous RGs . <p> The infamous problem that plagued the early RGs were the weak connectivity for the waist skirts . They pop out when you touch / trying to do various leg poses . This time the joints that connects with the waist skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they can not be detach easily . And the result are very solid waist skirts and I did n't have any problems of them falling off at all . Is a nice evolution for the RG series . <p> Is really good of Bandai to give provide a total of 6 manipulators . The manipulator seen below ( top left ) is dedicated for holding the beam rifle ( and the beam saber ) . There are also 1 opened palm hand , 2 closed fists , and 2 hands w/ movable fingers . This is definitely a step up for the RG series , as I recalled the frustration I had with the RG Aile Strike 's manipulators having the beam rifle / beam saber falling off all the time . Now , we can have solid manipulators that are not pretentious . <p> Gimmick : Shoulder Exhaust moves up / down <p> Gimmick : Booster cover that can be lifted up . <p> Open / Close Cockpit hatch <p> Includes a 1/144 Kira Yamato figure holding his helmet on his shoulder . Too bad the kit did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cockpit . <p> Various Action Poses : <p> The RG 1/144 Freedom Gundam is one of the most solid build for the RG series to date .

In fact , G3 served as Amuro 's upgraded MS on novelization of First Gundam . <p> It 's true in anime canon RX-78-2 is the original gundam , but before that here is G3 which served as the true concept of RX-78 : monotone color that meant truly a tool of war , not an colorful war machine that serve for toys commercial . <p> A concept can not be considered the true original . I 'm sure there were many concepts even before the G3 .

It just does n't work that way . <p> It 's the fucking " true gundam " cuz fucking Tomino original Colors design for the RX-78-2 was supposed to be those . But , you know , it 's not fancy nor childish . So they went with the actual colors that we all know : WBRY <p> RG rx78 was a fail ok but this one has a too vintage look . Why bandai just does n't bring the hguc version of the PG rx78 or at last the Ver.Ka since the molder it 's 80% done by the hguc GM Kai and GM custom ? <p> This is awesome . I do wish it had the bazooka or maybe the hammer , and it does not appear to , but for 1080 yen , I am not particularly shocked , and lord knows I could just borrow them from another kit . The much improved articulation is well worth it .

@@35099356 @4099356/ <p> " They did it with the old HG " That 's the thing , they do it with the old HG but not MG . If part swapping to get different variation of a model kit is possible , we would have gotten less Zakus ( type F and type J 's difference are basically only the thrusters ) . <p> Besides , it 's confirmed now with new pictures . It says Tallgeese I EW . <p> Well , for that to happen , the first Tallgeese design should 've had the heat rod shield to begin with . I guess you can either just wait for an MG Tallgeese III to be eventually announced , use the heat rod shield from an MG Epyon ( with some modifications ) , or use the heat rod shield from the 1/100 TGIII ( with some modifications ) . *shrug* <p> I personally like the round shield in the Tallgeese and Leo designs , so we 'll just have to agree to disagree on our tastes . <p> I 'm sorry to tell you that Bandai is never that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Age-1 normal , Spallow and Titus .

Are you willing to buy a kit that needs to dismantle and reassamble each time you want to change it to any version ? If you ask me , I wo n't . I prefer Bandai make them just the same as Age-1 . Furthermore , we can arrange them to stand side by side , it 's better that way . <p> Tallgeese I , II , and III are different units , unlike versions of AGE-1 which are upgraded/modified from a basic unit.Of course prejudices of Bandai being unkind/stingy/whatever can not be denied , but if we want to stay true to the series then we have to accept all 3 Tallgeeses be not convertible to each other in one box.Me ? I favor Tallgeese III the most , but imagining playing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to break open my piggybank before Tallgeese III . <p> Yeah , that retracting/recoil mechanism seems pretty awesome . From what I can see of the photos , though , it seems the ammo clip on the very back is permanent ; no indication you can remove it ( like you could with the HGUC and MG Zaku II 's machine gun ) . I wish the TG had that feature , but there 's still many good details and features with the dobergun , so I wo n't nitpick much about it . <p> Basically , they slap the EW label on it because the kit 's general proportions and the art it was based off of is from Katoki , who did all the wing versions . There are probably subtle differences . The Epyon EW also is actually very different in terms of proportions , enough so that it was a separate unit in the PSP SD Gundam game . <p> In a way your point is valid , because Hajime Katoki originally designed the Tallgeese ( and other OZ units ) before he redesigned Kunio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs were originally his , it does n't need much ( or any ) retuning . <p> But it is being marketed to be with the other EW MGs in promotion of the EW " The Glory of Losers " manga , so I would n't say it 's confusing . I guess it could be if one did n't pay any attention at all ; not everyone likes ( or pays attention to ) every Gundam anime/manga/story in the franchise , after all . ( And Gunpla--while awesome--is n't the most important thing ever known. ) *shrug* <p> I could also bring up the fact that--in that manga--Tallgeese now has a " heat lance " of sorts , but I doubt the MG would provide it , given that we have n't seen the add-ons for the MGs of Deathscythe ( wings ) , Heavyarms ( missiles/tank treads ) , Sandrock ( armor ) , and Shenlong ( sword ) . <p> I agree in part , since there is a subtle change with the inside of Tallgeese 's shield ( it more closely resembles the inside of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two added ) . <p> Katoki has even tweaked his redesigns of the GW Gundams before ; his Wing Gundam redesign changed a bit from the original drawings in ' 97 to the GFF and MG versions in ' 02 and ' 04 . Heavyarms got it 's gatling gun shield and combat knife back ( as attachments ) , and the Gundams ( apart from Wing ) have had major add-ons in the new manga ( which I guess Wing 's ammo racks can be retroactively counted as ) . Tallgeese even has a heat lance . <p> Oh , yes . I think the Leo is the only grunt design to rival the Zaku when measuring originality . It 's an exemplary example of a marriage between form and functionality . When you think about , it just makes damn sense , too . I posit that , when the day comes , a real-life , battle-ready mecha will look more like a Leo than anything else . <p> It 's a criminally underrated design . I gleefully explode at the mere prospect of Master Grade treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame war here , but 00 's designs are also a bit on the functional side . XD Back to G-Wing , ALL MS designs are realistic , gundams notwithstanding . They are a bit inconsistent though , the Leo has a beam saber but not a beam rifle ? Let 's hope the Leo and the Taurus show up on Bandai to-make list . <p> You 're partially right . But there are two different types of beam rifles Leos have used . Why was n't it a standard for all Leos to have both beam sabers and beam rifles ? <p> Perhaps early production models lacked beam saber weaponry ( even though the Tallgeese had them ) and many of these models ( upgraded and otherwise ) still are n't fit . Economic reasons could also fit in ; maybe fitting all Leo MSs with beam rifles and swords was too expensive for production ? <p> Quite frankly , I do n't worry about it ( I usually invoke the MST3k Mantra in these matters ) , and feel that the 105mm rifle is the most iconic weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield and beam sabers or not ) . So far , when I have my RD Leo ( and the MSiA Leo ) displayed among my collection , I have it holding the rifle . <p> Maybe when/if I get the limited RD Leo Space Type , I 'll have it on display holding the beam rifle it comes with . *shrug* <p> Eh , more likely it 'll be at the 20th anniversary of Wing ( not unlike MG Wing 's release on GW 's 15th ) . EW:TGoL and GW:FT are still being released , so I guess this is continued promotion for it . Plus , I have to wonder if Katoki 's designs are more popular over there right now over Okawara 's versions ... <p> In the meantime , I 'd say get the RD WGZ ( TV ver. ) and enjoy it , for now . I believe it to be the best representation of WGZ ( TV ver. ) in model/figure form , currently . <p> Mg wing zero tv ver is gon na happen sooner than later . When the announcement came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing for this year in 2013 a outline of a wing zero tv ver was on the banner . The way the banner was designed is like how they have most mg announcements . Outlined in a certain color and no filling on the line art . <p> Since Katoki originally designed the Tallgeese ( and other OZ grunt MSs ) , there 's not much of any difference . But there is at least one noticeable difference in the shield ; the inside of the shield has a closer resemblance to a Leo 's shield in configuration . In the original , the beam sabers were paired together , with a short handle that 's off to the side of the beam sabers . The handle for Tallgeese ver . EW 's shield is in-between the beam sabers , so the Tallgeese 's left hand can easily grab it . <p> Basically , just think of Endless Waltz ( whether it be the OVAs or the " Glory of Losers " manga ) as basically Wing 's own " Gundam : The Origin " ; in that MSG manga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a different ( yet basically faithful ) look . <p> Sometimes , I do think Bandai should 've included the TGoL add-ons in the EW MGs , or at least release a TGoL weapons pack of sorts . As far as knockoff Gunpla goes , good for them in " one-upping " Bandai on doing just that , but since I do n't care about Gunpla knock-offs ( let alone pay attention to any of ' em ) , it 's not much of a score of any kind , in my view . <p> On the other hand , I thought the EW designs were great before TGoL came with the add-ons . They may be awesome , but given that they 're just add-ons , they 're not really necessary . It basically just give Wing and Heavyarms more ammo ( which are probably the most practical add-ons ) , it gives Sandrock more armor ( that it has to dispense of if it wants to be mobile with it 's limbs ) , it gives Deathscythe wings ( giving it some additional flight and mobility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shenlong gets a sword ( which is basically a substitute for the Dragon Fang , since it ca n't extend like it could in Okawara 's design ) . <p> If anything , in the case of Shenlong--like with the optional moving head in the RD Leo 's option pack--there should 've been something to make Shenlong 's dragon fang extendable again . It looked like it was extendable in one of the artworks Moruga ( one of the TGoL mechanical designers ) had made , but it is n't in Katoki 's lineart ( he could 've made a minor tweak in his design ) nor is it in the manga . ( Again , Shenlong 's sword is used instead . ) <p> we know that b-cl*8 will start to make the add-on weapon and one more thing ... IT 'S F*&amp;%NG EXPENSIVE ... just like a long time ago when they made resin conversion part from HG to be ver.ka model ... <p> i hope its not like the condition when strike freedom ( ordinary ) or destiny ( ordinary ) release and then strike freedom FBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable ... hmmmmm ... and its helluva expensive once more ! ! ! ! NOOOOOOOO <p> No , we do n't know . We can guess based on their past actions ... Maybe they 'll eventually release add-on parts as a normal or limited release , or maybe they wo n't bother ( as I originally thought when it came to the chances of EW ver . Gunpla having modern HG or MG releases ) . <p> And sure , if they release it as a limited release or as resin conversion kit parts , they 'll be expensive , but so can be the Gunpla and figure-collecting hobby in general . I wish it were n't , but I do n't believe purely trashing helps any . Either get ' em or do n't ( which is a stronger statement than random comments on a random blog ; I doubt Bandai will read our exchange here , let alone re-think anything ) . <p> As far as it being " hard " for GW fans to collect related Gunpla and figures , it is n't . Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago when there was only the regular 1/144 and 1/100 lineups , MSiAs , one GFF , and two MGs . I can only guess you were pessimistic enough back then ( as I was ) to think we would n't have much releases in the MG ( or even modern HG ) lineup , let alone releases about Katoki 's version of the GW Gundams . <p> But be glad that--after the 15th anniversary came and MG Wing ( TV ver. ) was released--you now have a new manga re-telling the story in a different way ( ala " Gundam : The Origin " ) , a sequel story , and quite a few MGs based on such new material ( that involves Katoki 's redesigns both existing and new ) . Add to that , there are now quite a few GW-series Robot Damashii figures ( whether already released or will be ) . <p> Sure , some releases are limited items ( RD Wing ver . EW , RD Leo Space Type ) that seem too expensive , but either get them anyway or just sigh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now have to choose from , Wil . It 's certainly more than what TAG has gotten ( and I like TAG ) . <p> You mean the legs ? The Tallgeese and Leo legs were always wider above the knee and smaller below the knee ; I found it to be more " human-like " that way in comparison to some of the " bell-bottom " legs of some Universal Century MS designs . <p> If you mean they 're exaggerated a bit , then I guess you may have a point there , since I think I see that a bit . The waist looks like it could be just right , and it seems the other parts of the Tallgeese look right proportionally . <p> Well , I thought I saw your point to an extent , but if you look closely at the photos ( even the older ones ) , it 's just the perspective of how we see this unpainted model . But if you still feel that way after taking it to account , then you should also have this minor nitpick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had bigger thighs , which is evident in their lineart . <p> Again , I see that as being just a little bit more human-like in that aspect of TG 's ( and the Leo 's ) design than the bell-bottom legs that Zeonic and Gryps-era MS designs have . I personally never had a problem with that , nor do I with the bell-bottom legs of those other MSs I mentioned . <p> According to Brian in a comment above , some of the description states that the MG Tallgeese is using a " Leo frame " , so it 's likely we 'll see it ( and the succeeding Tallgeeses ) . <p> And remember that the EW MGs ( outside of the repackaged Wing Gundam ver . Ka ) basically use the same inner-frame as the MG Wing Gundam ( TV ver . ) .

However , I think a Leo ( and its variations ) is likely too with this . <p> Some people are not thankful that we are getting MG Tallgeese in the first place . There are a lot of others Bandai could bring to the MG line . ( I 'm waiting for Wing Zero TV ver . also ) .

As much of a Seed-Destiny hater I am , realistically looking at it , Bandai would'nt stop making Seed-Destiny kits because of it 's huge fanbase in japan . my point is They would probably release RG kits every other series UC-SEED-UC-SEED-UC <p> Yeah , I think we could have spotted that without you telling us .

As for this " GP01 " it looks really minimalistic and somewhat boring . I wo n't be getting this though I can appreciate why others would like it . <p> Actually , if you look at just originality , Seed-Destiny has terrible designs . You can not say it 's a fact that the Strike Freedom is the best . It 's one of the least original Gundams out there . It ripped off of the X Gundam 's legs , it suffers from poor mechanical design ( you need to deploy the dragoons to use the wings of light ? wow. ) , it only changes a little from Freedom , and it takes Sazabi 's chest cannon . I 'm sure there are others , but none come to mind at the moment . The Turn A is a better design in terms of originality . Of course , I do n't care whether or not you like it . It looks okay . It 's just so unoriginal . I know they 'll keep makiing Seed Destiny RGs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> @Error : BTW G are not from UC kiddo. anon at 4.55 are expressing how crappy is GSD 's design .

The MG GP01 after all , shares the features of the impulse- core flyer , chest block and lower body block so this RG might be a testbed for the technology to be used in the impulse . <p> to anon 10:23keep dreaming man , BanDai wo n't release any 00 or at least any other series in the RG line ANY TIME SOON .

After that , BanDai will Introduce a new series in the RG line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X ? think what has the largest fanbase in japan . <p> I love the Turn A but I could never see it getting a RG or PG release . The primary wow factor of the PG line , and the RG line in particular , is the fully independent internal frame " skeleton " . The Turn A Gundam does n't have an internal frame . In the anime it was actually hollow IIRC . <p> I finally wait until this come out , MG 2.0 faster come ! ! 0083 Stardust Memory , was the best Gundam OVA I ever watched compared to the others . The cost of doing OVA was different than TV Series , so TV series got some cost restriction and ca n't be realistically compared with OVA . <p> BUT I could comment here that , if you did n't  watch Gundam 0083 in your life , there is a lost for you . Watch 0083 in around 13episodes in total ( I remembered ) was better than you watch 50 episodes of any other TV series.Its flow of story has been compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its storyline also not focus on those GODLIKE gundam with a small civillian boy ( 1 Gundam vs 200++ MS ) , it describe a teambase millitary soldier to chase over the stolen Gundam GP02A ( the 1st stolen gundam among all other Series , Creative Point , then others series start copy from this ) . <p> All teammates also have the rights to drive that only 1 gundam , if they have competence to and allowed by the captain . ( Not the setting that only the main character can touch gundam . ) <p> I did n't like 0083 . The story , while not terrible , did a very poor job of bridging the gap between MSG and Zeta . And the characters ( omg Nina .. ) sometimes made me want punch them in the face . The animation and mech designs were defintely top of the line I 'd still rank it as one of my lowest UC shows <p> Actually both Mr. Seabook &amp; Mr. Heart labyrinth are right in parts , because the " Real " stolen/borrow one is the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits me &gt; civilian young nerd , and since then never turn it back XD <p> No matter how many times I see this Gundam I will always see it as really ugly . Go ahead and name call if it makes you feel better because someone has an opinion that differs from yours , but as far as I 'm concerned the GP-01 is very ugly , unimpressive , and very much what I would see as a grunt Gundam . Stardust has some good Gundams , but this ai n't one of them . GP-02 and GP-03 are where the sexyness is at . <p> while I would not totally agree with you , my opinion is , I would not call it ugly , but The GP01 is quite Underwhelming , and plain in design though I still like it . the GP03s really makes up for it because of it 's sexiness.this kit is still a must buy , and I 'M PRAYING THAT GP03s WILL GET AN G TREATMENT <p> Nope , it is not an online only kit .

I do think its time for more real grade char suits , hyuk shiki and what not . <p> I think Gundam Unit 1 from 0083 is an interesting release . I 'd be even more excited if they mentioned if it will have the core block system ( which Kou actually did use more than Amuro for escape/attack purposes ) and the core fighter . <p> mono eye needs more love ! srsly there are awesome mono eye mses ot there like kampfer , gouf custom , sinanju , cgue , and the only ones to get rg treatment are 2 variations of zaku II ? ? gp01 is cool yeah , but plain and boring as an rg imo <p> While some people may find the design too simple or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like the GP01 design . There 's that simplistic base design factor that is charming , like the RX-78-2 , MK-II and Woundwor- I mean , Alex . <p> But I do hope they stick to the pastel-ish color of the lineart . I wonder what gimmicks this would have other than the core fighter . Maybe ... figures of Kou Uraki and Nina Purpleton . <p> And in the next RG GP02 , a loadable nuke and a figure of Nina Purpleton smashed into tiny smithereens . <p> I know that the core-fighter is going to be really nice ( GP01 , GP01fb , and GP03 all have big , awesome , core-fighters . Should be more stable than RG RX-78-2 ( maybe as good as RG MK-II ) and will have excellent poseablity . <p> I really like the look of this RG 's line art . To some it looks plain and uninteresting , but to me it pulls off the prototype look better than any other Gundam has , which is absolutely should , and is just sexy to boot . <p> Flame me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . This RG is truly Excitement Embodied for me ! Bring the other GPs to RG as well ! <p> Probably the angle it was drawn from .

Looks cool no ? : P <p> you little bitches calm down , RG is all about making the kit more realistic in every detail and its proportions . That 's the fcking point of this RG line . @anon1:08 , If you do not recognize this as the GP01/FB then you have a problem with your eyes , or worse , with your head . <p> Bandai , on purpose , made huge changes on the MS design for the sole purpose of making it look more " realistic " though they are as robert said , " fictional robots fighting in space " . <p> If Destiny is the 11th Real Grade model and the latest image with English text says these are 13th and 14th , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missing something ?

I used to not like this Gundam too much . I thought it was too bulky in all the wrong places . I eventually came to appreciate some of the intricacies of the design . Looking at it from the front , you see a Gundam with a sunburst or halo effect behind it , as if it were playing on some religious themes . This is remarkably fitting for Rau 's character , since he saw himself as some sort of Messiah figure . I 'm glad the modeller chose the Providence . Again , wonderful design , wonderful customizations , and wonderful talent . 
@@35099364 @4099364/ <p> It really is such a shame that so much time is being wasted this close to the end of the series . The idea behind Lacus reading Meer 's diary is n't bad , but in the end it 's a waste because we do n't learn anything new . We already knew how excited Meer was to become Lacus and help Durandal . We all know how Meer was poisoned by fame and deluded herself into believing that she was Lacus . All this episode really did was waste time with clips and a new Meer song . Instead of covering the same ground with Meer again , would it have been too much trouble to devote an episode to what happened to Mu and how he became Neo ? That 's a dangling thread that has so far received no attention . The end of the episode focuses on Durandal 's announcement of the Destiny Plan , which we already know the details of . Too bad that this episode has no time for Shinn or anyone on the Minerva .

He has clearly taken the time to go through all of the correct prep work and I 'm sure he would have had to redo more than a few pieces to get it looking that perfect . I 'm with DC on that one . Huge amount of effort in painting a PG and by all accounts it is spectacular . Congratulations Matt ! <p> I choose Matt Tomczek 's PG GP01 . The amount of work put into a perfect grade versus master grades is very incomparable . From assembly to painting , this perfect grade deserves the win . Camo pattern is stunning and is too much work for any average modeler . The internals is sick and made the kit look 10 times more expensive . The PG is both very difficult to do and stunning at the same time . <p> I actually liked Matt 's GP01 , Dade 's Quebeley &amp; Anthony S 's ANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down into the technicals ..

It truly was a very tough category to judge . <p> You got pro modellers ( hundreds of $$$ commision artist ) like Matt Tomczek and others competing for model kits and not cash prizes ? You got to wonder if they want to win those kits so bad or just get their names out there as a portfolio/advertisement of sorts ( wink wink , nudge nudge ) . Oh well , tough luck for you casuals/newbies out there . <p> As much as I respect how much you have contributed to the community , I 've got to question the nature of this contest .

My skill sucks . I agree with the above comment . But most of the contest , even recent bandai world cup did n't have category for beginner / pros . They had junior class , but that 's for kids .

You would probably end up with the top guns gravitating to the PGs , and HGs for casuals . <p> Pick a more appropriate comparison : a newly assembled high school track team competing for the first time against other schools who have had years of experience and coaching . This is essentially what this competition had . <p> The only problem I have is that this winning entry was made in 2007 and has already won in previous photo contests .

Like someone already said , its like putting Usain Bolt against high school athletes . The next contest should have some alterations to take these factors into account . <p> But anyway , congrats to Matt . Although the Qubeley was my favorite to win . <p> I do n't see a problem with his win . Sure it 's kind of unfair , but nowhere did he break or even stretch any of the rules .

I 'd like to ask this though : what is the source ( kit , product ) of the shotgun seen in pics like 51. jpg ? <p> I did a bit of looking around , and I think Banpresto makes things mostly for arcade prizes , like U.F.O. catchers and stuff .

I 've only seen one listing on eBay for the whole set of three , and the seller has it at $110USD.

@@35099386 @4099386/ <p> Because Seed really do have good designs . You can hate on the stories , but u ca n't hate on the designs because of the story ... If your gon na counter with them having wings , UC has a few suits with wings as well .. Queen Mansa , Kshatriya ( they called it the quad wing ) , Sinaju ( no matter how you look at it , those are small wings .. Do n't  argue that they are boosters , because i can say the same for every other suits with wings ) , and finally Hi-Nv <p> That 's only two Gundams . Google is your friend . To me , UC suits focus more on realistic designs and utilitarianism . Some designs are pretty nice like the V2 , Hi-Nu , Sinanju to name a few but UC is n't known for having " eye-catching " designed suits . Comparing apples to oranges , friend . <p> The same guy that designed a lot of stuff for UC also designed a lot of stuff for SEED , so the basics are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , why do I like UC designs over SEED designs . Cause SEED got crazy with their main characters ' mechs . The first 5 Gs were actually cool IMO but the next 3 OMNI and the next 3 ZAFT suits were too much . And then we got to destiny where the 4 out of the first 5 look like they were made just to look cool.So yeah , SEED in general does n't even try to not like a 20-minute commercial for bandai . <p> You guys brought up an interesting point here.If you look at " making the SEED suits look cool " from a Gundam EVOLVE perspective ( assuming you guys watched all the episodes ) , this statement holds true . <p> Why ? Consider this : Going on the premise that the EVOLVE shorts represent a good chunk of the Gundam universe , out of the 2 SEED EVOLVE shorts , the main SEED short was about the Strike being bad-ass and fucking shit up for its enemies ( not that there 's a problem ) . No , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamato ( or any SEED character , really ) went through ( like they did for EVOLVE 1 ) , or the political after-effects of the O.M.N.I vs . ZAFT war ( the same way they explored the mental states of people after the One-Year-War in EVOLVE 12 ) , nor even just a regular quick mission that the Strike had to carry out in an average day on the Archangel ( like the ZZ in EVOLVE 10 ) . <p> No . <p> It was a fucking gorgeous robot blowing shit up like a fucking ninja . In terms of plot , even EVOLVE 14 ( Gundam SD ) had more plot than EVOLVE 8 . <p> This brings me to an important point that a lot of people do n't consider when forming their arguments within the fanbase : Assuming the extreme that all 15 shorts reflect the franchise as a whole , from the amount of content in those 15 shorts of EVOLVE , one can state that there are more U.C shorts ( 10 out of 15 ) than SEED shorts ( 2 out of 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ? Of course not . We can say both U.C and SEED focus on plot and politics - U.C more so than SEED - but it 's apparent that SEED , with its over-the-top action and the way it moves ninja-like compared to U.C , has brought out the best in the action part of the Gundam experience . It 's like if I get tired of the politics in Zeta , I 'll just go watch some action in SEED . <p> As a U.C fan I say this : Be proud , SEED fans . Your PG Astray moves and looks more ninja-like than the U.C line and is ultimately what made Gundam even more fun . <p> lol .. bandai only doing re-color the red frame into blue . you could do your own customization by re-paint the red frame into blue frame . so next PG would be gold frame or green frame .. Geez ... such a waste . is it bandai out of budget to create a PG ? I wish to see gundam X or turn A gundam as PG . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was already as heavy as heck with the MG , imagine the detail and weight of the PG ............ Lazy in bandai 's part , but still glad they did this ..... <p> Well in all technicality The first 3 Astrays ( Red Blue And Gold ) were aesthetically the same , bare the equipment they may have snatched escaping Heliopolis . Customizations down the road were just that , Down the road . <p> But I can totally agree , they should have included the Tactical Arms . Knowing Bandai it 'll be a separate P-Bandai exclusive later on . <p> Sazabi in PG ? ? ?

LOL 8D <p> ... I 'd of bought it if it was a plated gold frame since I lack any pg 's . <p> A shame really , but remember people , bandai 's pg series is just a test bed for mg advances , a pg unicorn now would be useless as they got it as perfect as they could ( despite crap legs and stability issues ) plus cost is a big factor ... <p> Why I think this about the unicorn is because ... well they made the mg THEN the hg which was fairly stable despite rubbish legs on all variations , I lack the time to research previous releases of pg 's to their mg/hg counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable , but due to a lack of popularity+nothing to really trial that wo n't happen , any new pg 's would be of a newer series that does something mind blowing that they ca n't try on a mg ... <p> Although if they wanted to really push , a pg kshatriya that fixes the binder issues , so the mg would be magnificent , but no one could afford it thus it 'd fail XD <p> Yup . Whoring out Astray now , and on top of that , making them ALL Bandai Exclusives . Seriously , Bandai ? I swear they are really scraping at the bottom of the barrel . This is pathetic . More pathetic than the MG Red Frame and Astray Noir . Just .... no . Ugh . I like Seed MS but it 's time they DIAL Seed waaaay back . <p> Wow so many negative comments . Maybe bandai should just stop pg series if you are all so ungrateful . Or maybe you all should just make your own pg blue frame if you think you all can do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it . Bandai can produce whatever they want . I 'm just sick and tired of reading negativity where ever I go . <p> Does anyone realize that this is P-Bandai Hobby Online Exclusive ? It 's not a massed produced model kit ; stop whining . They are simply putting this in production for the people that care . So if you do n't care to buy , regardless if you hate SEED or not , then do n't try to get it . <p> There are so many gundams Bandai can make perfect grades from like unicorn , nu , exia , gouf custom , sazabi , heck maybe grunts would make good perfect grades . Bandai should really stop making seed perfect grades after seeing this blue frame , it really gives me facepalms seeing this .

Corrupt , multi-national corporations hold sway over the world 's resources , and exploit the natural world to the point where only a handful of ecologically viable areas exist , and those areas are under threat as well ... These corporations have acquired protection against world-wide protest &amp; revolt by essentially buying the most advanced military forces in existance ( consisting of mechs , high-powered tanks &amp; aircraft , nukes , etc. ) which keep the population subdued under horrific conditions , and render all forms of established governmental opposition essentially obsolete and powerless.Quietly growing from within these corporations , there exists a small but powerful secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy has long passed , and the time for desperate measures has come.They seek a future in which mankind has moved beyond the controlling grasp of the elite , to create a new life on a restored planet Earth , and among the stars as well.Developed from the latest technology , and piloted by a chosen daughter of this secret group , the mechanized humanoid weapon , code named " Gundam " , may be humanity 's best hope for restoring balance to the world and overthrowing the tyranical corporate empire that has sought to destroy it . <p> This definitely needs some fine tuning , but I think it 's a decent start.Plus a female main protagonist/pilot would be quite original as well.There would , of course , be a strong emphasis on the theme of ecological **25;154;TOOLONG and such , but I think one of the other main , over-arching themes of the story could play around with the idea that " change comes only from within " . The corporations might represent how we as people , groups , and even nations , can spiral out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use a " militia " of self-justifying excuses &amp; denials to protect ourselves from criticism ( whether from outside ourselves or within ) . Just as the corporations ' negativity have affected the entire planet , our own individual negativities affect people/things within the sphere of our own personal lives . And the " Gundam " might represent the inner strength we all must summon within ourselves to stand against our darker , destructive impulses , and to find the hope necessary to " reach for the stars " , so to speak . <p> Humanity 's exploration of the stars.With the calming of hostilities in the Earth Sphere , man takes up the daunting task of exploring the rest of the galaxy . New nations are formed in the wake of the colonization waves , and old grudges resurface . The massive expanse of space , teems with incredible possibility and wonder , but key questions haunt : Are we alone in the universe ? and what is mankind 's destiny among the stars ? <p> Concept for the main Gundam is that its main feature is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Mild FTL travel exists , there is an emerging rivalry among the new nations , and the exploration of space . <p> key to this is the idea of the promise of humanity to reach greater heights and that this is sometimes hampered by old wounds , moral failings and many other divisive issues that are prevalent in human society . <p> 2013 Post War , humans have lost their technology in a Great War 2000 years ago . 90% of humanity live on earth while the other ten percent live in deep space . But on the 13 of May 2013 , those living in space decide to reclaim earth ... as they were once exiled 10000 years ago . Chaos ensues when the United Earth Government denies the existance of these Spacenoids . War broke out when Hi tech Spacenoids vs the UEG forces which only have a technology comparable with the early 21th century . The populance on Earth starts finding the lost technology and mass private excavation occurs . Fearing an uprising the UEG started a rule stating that all people that have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheading . When school student Ian Borghijin excavates a Humanoid robot that self heals behind his school at Ulaanbatar , he is hunted down by the UEG for having a MS . Ian is thrown into chaos as he is forced to join the spacenoids in their struggle against the UEG.Thats my idea of a story . Also .. a lead gundam that self heals and transform into a plane . And cute female characters too . <p> Something that I would n't mind seeing happen is having a gundam series based in a conflict between two major corporations . Both that control one half of the world , however , the role of the gundam serves to be the martyr of one side , and of course , " the white devil " to the other , what with propaganda flying all-around by both powers . <p> Unlike the OYW , this is all " secret warfare " , and all attacks done by the Gundam are under the veil of a monster . With elements from 00 , one side investigates the secrets and mysteries of the gundam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , than the actual side holding them ) , whilst the " gundam " side focuses more on the action and effects from both sides . But the motives from both sides and previous actions is what makes it truly " gray " in terms of who the REAL good guy is . As it tackles the issues of greed , espionage , miscommunication , and power . <p> A perspective of the main character being the losing side on the team in the story . Now let twist the story around let make the Villain the main character , and beating up the super hero just because of vengeance after so many of his/her comrade die in vain . <p> A veteran mercenary who having the tough time wining again the new generation.Using the wicked strategy to defeat his/her opponent most of the time is unsuccessful usually many casualty along the way . After resolve his/her vengeance he soon realize he/she have become a monster and start on a salvation for his/her crime . <p> Since in the eye of young minded teenagers , whatever the elders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they just wanted make quickest solution to their problem and being conservative about the future . <p> Just an idea was n't sure it might look similar with some story let me know cause I do n't do much reading these day &gt; : ) <p> I 'd like to go away from the Gundam norm a bit and make it more of a fantasy story(I 'm sure purists would hate it ) . Many centuries ago there was a team of people who saved the world from some evil force using Gundams and sealed it away . Over the years most technology was lost or changed as magical abilities awakened within humans and people would use the magic as a technological power source . The Gundams all had different things happened to them . Some were destroyed or thought to have been , some were passed down through families , and some were sold to the highest bidder . No Gundams would have any guns and would fight either with melee weapons or through the pilots magical abilities ( fireballs , lightning , etc ) . The Gundams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special alloy . The pilots use their own personal energy reserves to use them and so they 're a huge risk for someone to actually pilot . <p> Eventually the evil starts awakening and starts sending beasts it creates out to scout or generally run amok in the world looking for a way to release their master . Some Gundam owners also join forces with this evil being as the heroes rise to challenge the evil . <p> Gundams with young adults pilot as main character not 13 or 16 or &lt; 18 year old child as pilot that skill is far way better than veteran or more experience pilot , that 's ridicules , when we were that age , we all were in school . More political involve , like Char Aznable and Amuro in Char 's Counter Attack . They all grown up.I 'm sorry , Gundam Age turn me totally down when I see small kid involve in war , even after that he and his son and grandson piloting gundam , still .... not suitable for me . Same with V gundam , Age 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that age , everyone goes to school . Did you see a &lt; 18 year old kid in war in Afgan or Iraq from US ? That is now promoted to Captain rank in the age of 18 ? This kinda things be logic will be better . <p> it does n't matter what time it is , just a scientist discovered that there is many types of earth in the universe , but it can not be seen . The scientist made a machine and summoned the other earth to continue to do research . <p> But the scientist miscalculated that the earth will crash together because of inertia . A boy which dreamed to be a pilot ( which is not younger than the Age boy , probably more mature ) and saw what scientist is doing . The scientist had invented the decade gundam which will rule all other gundams and the earths . <p> The scientist told the boy basically how to pilot gundam and died because of sick . The boy never knew that the earth will soon crush together but continued to fulfill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story goes on and on .... <p> Visit this page to see my design of the LONG ... <p> Here is my scenario . Much of Earth 's natural resources have been spent . The day in which humanity has dreaded for so long has finally come and now the Earth has little to offer but empty and dry land . What scarce resources that still remain are unequally distributed to the privileged class of human population who have now moved into space colonies in space , away from the polluted Earth . The small fraction of humans that live in space live comfortable lives while the large population that were unable to leave the polluted Earth , live in chaos and in poverty . The government , which dictates the distribution of resources and the the conservation of high society keeps these two classes forever separated . They justify their actions by saying how the only way humanity can survive is to decrease the human population to the genetically superior so that when the Earth has finally healed to its original state , humans may come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chosen to live in the colonies were considered inferior humans and were left on the polluted Earth to die . Naturally , people on Earth were unhappy over this injustice , which resulted in many small skirmishes around the world . The government eventually organized an elite army on Earth , equipped with state of the art mobile suits to suppress these rebellions . But these suppression operations resulted in massacres where even ordinary citizens not involved with the rebellion were killed as well . Our main character is a 16 year old boy who lives in the colonies . During a trip to another colony , his shuttle is hijacked by people from Earth and is then brought to their spacecraft as a hostage . As a hostage , he learns about the hardships of those who remain on Earth and he learns about the group 's goal to overthrow the current government . But with their limited technology , they are unable to do much . For now , they are trying to increase their military strength by stealing weapons from the colonies . The group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon where their informant has told them that on that base , the government 's military is researching and building a new weapon . Once they occupy that base , they will steal this new weapon and all data related to it and return to Earth to eliminate the government 's elite army . The boy feels sympathetic to the group 's cause and decides to help them with their mission . When they arrive at the moon base , the group was able to infiltrate the base and occupy it long enough to find and steal the new weapon . On their spacecraft , they find that the new weapon 's code name is Gundam . The boy is assigned as the Gundam 's pilot and will now fight for the sake of the people on Earth . <p> In the future , developed planets sent Gundam pilots traveled through the stars in search of inhabitable planets . Landing on one planet , they decide to leave it alone due to the habitation of an underdeveloped civilization.Those who saw the Gundams described them as " Gods from the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a single altar on the inside for prayerEventually an unknown life force from space makes it 's way to their planet.The life force gives consciousness to the statues , manifesting differently within each one.Although the statues gain consciousness , they are unable to move . Their consciousness allows them to communicate through telepathy however.One of the malevolent statues beckons to a warrior hero , posing as a god and promising him eternal glory and peace to his people.He leads the warrior inside the altar , which then closes off upon his entrance . The warrior 's mind resonates with the life force , allowing the statue to become animated through their combined will.Wall murals on the inside of the statue project the outer environment , serving as the monitor to the Gundam 's " cockpit . " As time goes on , the statues consciousness begins to overtake that of the pilot's.People revere the descended god at first , but begin to fear him due to his harsh rule . Newly animated statues ( now the Gundams of the series ) gather and form an allieance.The first main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gundam users from other parts of the country . <p> Things of note : -The Gundams allow for quicker travel , so some of the Gundams could factor different motifs into their designs based on older art styles.Example : compare ancient Hindu art to Japanese mythology statues/paintings-After the Gundams become fully animated , they change project a color scheme over their base statue design-The Gundams and their pilots serve as 2 separate , yet intertwined characters . <p> I personally do n't have any problems with a series that has an " overpowering Gundam " so long as it 's treated properly , like in Char 's Counterattack , the Nu Gundam is an overpowering suit but still required the piloting skills of Amuro Ray to be effective ( not to mention fighting the Sazabi on an even ground ) . Same can be said with the unicorn , the Banshee , and the Sinanju which , while being overpowering mechs in Gundam Unicorn , still pretty much depended on the skills or " will " of its pilots to be effective . <p> I would also prefer they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit pilots ; they all do n't have to be angsty-teenagers ala Amuro Ray when he was younger . I agree with some of you that a female lead would be interesting . Of course , I would also prefer that she 's a well-trained albeit a rookie pilot instead of a civilian forced to pilot a Gundam because of circumstances . She does n't have to be an ace pilot even , but someone who is just good enough to run a mobile-suit competently . It would be good to see an oldtype pilot fight on even ground with a newtype " ace " . If that 's not " realistic " for some , there 's always the Nitro system ... and then the side-effects of that system should be explored . <p> Oh and try to cut down on the " Why should there always be war " crap . You have missiles and beam lasers being fired at you : that should be enough convince you that you 're in a war . I do n't know , but yelling " STOP " in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen not only in Gundam but in many other anime . <p> how about something crazy ? ? 3 ancient legendary gundam ( without pilot ) move around ... and then interfere with human 's war many many years ago ... then they were sealed away ... in present ( most likely about 100-200 years later , another war break out ... reviving them would be a key to end the war but in a very destructive way ... 3 of them(legends) are brothers , fought as a team ... soon a boy who is an orphan has his homage crush due to the beginning of war ... sought to revenge ... he revive one of them ( a gunner berserker like a heavily armed assault-gun mid range type ) but it went berzerk and ran away . While reviving the second 1 ( plan to call it Sword Dancer , extreme light and fast , highly agile and thin gundam ) the humans military intefere and had the legend killed the whole people without a scratch . So he ( it ? ) asked the boy wat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but end up in his heart he slowly changed to a pacifist who wish end the war fast ... so the Sword ( melee legend transforming type ) told him to search for the ultimate fallen brother ( the eldest ... heavily armed , extremely agile , strongest and superior to the 2 younger brethen ) note : even with the 2 younger to combine strength still no match to him/it ? a well armed for all purpose fighting style , from stealth to 1-all , 1-1 , extreme long range support fire , berzerking , extreme swift melee combat , to seek advice from him ... storyline wise , developers can change any part ... hope they like it LOL , oh did i mention that boy is a pilot that is slowly become strong ... well , human military was developing something to kill 3 legends as well ... so a lot of fighting was induced in the search for the 3 ... while both the berserker and sword dancer are captured , human derived alot of new tech from them ... in searching the eldest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy went through hell and nearly died , in last breath mode , he succeeded in triggering and revive the eldest and so he survived as the eldest went into killing spree mode and had all immobilized ( without killing ) , and thus the conversation begun ... <p> Remember that thing Tem Ray gave Amuro at side 6 to boost the Gundam 's abilities ? Yeah that thing Amuro dismissed as a piece of junk . It was totally legit and magical . It was retrieved by AE and was used as the basis for psychoframe technology that prevented the Axis Shock incident . Further engineering of the device gave technologies that was used in the UC Project ; after the events of Unicorn , God Unicorn went drifting in space and the device was put into storage . Centuries later it would be used was the core of the Ultimate Gundam in an attempt to reform the earth , it gets corrupted and becomes the Devil Gundam . Following it 's demise the device is left drifting in space . The device will eventually be assimilated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nature . The device is transformed into the Turn X and is sent towards earth . Events of the Dark history creates the Turn A and forces the two units to fight during the time of the Correct Century . The two in it 's cocoon like state is pulled into into Jupiter and reawakens millenia later ; by then the earth has lost it 's old history and was a new world where the events of 00 took place . Setsuna would eventually merge with the ELS and ; forever connecting the man who created the Gundam with the man who Became Gundam . <p> Gundam with no child pilots and must not be IMBA . They can have specific strength in certain area like melee combat but must have weakness and cant take on the whole army with just one suit . Weapons must be primarily projectile base and beam weapon reserve for super IMBA damage with long cool down . Story with 4 way FFA war filled with constant alliance and betrayal between USA , Europe , china and Russia . adding a few neutral state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> a story about an evil scientist who wants to take control of the earth , he created a device that can summon a black hole that teleport the gundam antagonist ( from all series ) . while another scientist knew what the evil scientist is doing , so he steal the device to summon the gundam protagonist to oppose the evil scientist 's doing . <p> After the aftermath of the Gundam AGE series , a group of 4 angry gundam fans attack the Bandai headquarters , infiltrating the basement which houses a gigantic underground base . They steal a giant mobile suit carrier containing 4 mobile suits based on those from the AGE series , which they rename the RAGE-1 , RAGE-2 , RAGE-3 and the RAGE-FX , to further show how damn angry they are that that show sucked butt . The group is lead by the masked char-clone character named Suiton , who following the style of a char clone , is n't actually good or evil , and actually does n't  hate the show at all . But is in it all for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunpla factory , enslave the employees , and force them to finally release all the Gundams on his wishlist ! <p> However Bandai send waves and waves of GM style grunt suits at the 4 gundam thiefs , and the pilot of the RAGE-FX can not handle the mobile suit and passes out . The suit crashes in the middle of Akihabara and is instantly swarmed by smelly otaku , who all want to pilot it/take a photo with it for their blog . When suddenly a super handsome and muscular foreigner who happened to be vacationing in Japan , and just happened to be sitting in the Gundam cafe drinking a sweet , sweet red Full Frontal cocktail , going by the alias Gundam Guy bursts onto the scene . <p> ' ' Get away from that god-damn Gundam you big smelly nerds ! Leave this to me ! " he yell , while ripping off his shirt exposing his muscular prowess . THe otaku all shuffle out of his way as he heroically struts up to the glorious machine . The cockpit opens automatically as if the gundam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGE-hater from the cockpit and takes his rightful place in the pilots seat . Due to his years spent accumulation Gundam information he can operate the mobile suit using noting but sheer manly instinct . <p> The rest plays out like a typical anime : -the first couple of mobile suit pilots go down easily enough. - He has multiple classes with Suiton who pilots the RAGE-1 normal , now painted red , and can use the RAGE system to change the weapons , arms and legs of the RAGE-1 to parts of gundams from his wishlist. -Gundam guy is randomly a student in Japanese high school for no apparent reason , and this goes on for more episodes than it needs to. -the third mobile suit pilot is defeated. -after a final epic clash with suiton ( the char clone ) they accept each other and know they will forever remain rival pilots. -Gundam Guy confronts and defeats the evil organisation who was actually behind it all , and everone lives happily ever after. -Pointless unrelated movie for money ! <p> The year is 79 of the Dark Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a planet of infinite darkness . The world and its inhabitants have evolved to live without the sun ( turning the planet in a very hostile alien-like world ) . In this evolution there are some humans who have not evolved and seek out artificial light to illuminate their world . Those who embraced the darkness seek to wipe out those who seek the light , and a long drawn out war has been fought for centuries . Now The Veil have developed a new weapon for their war against The Illuminati known as Shades . Weapons that obliterate all of the conventional weapons of war . The Shades however require a special kind of pilot that has undergone some genetic manipulation . These pilots are known as Shadows . The Illuminati counter these war machines with their Gundam . A special weapon just as powerful as the Shades , and the pilot is a natural human being who later is revealed to be mankind 's next evolutionary step . ( This person can be male or female ) male - the forefatherfemale - the mother to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stepping stone to restoring the sun and the earth , pushing humanity back onto another evolutionary course ... <p> Any Timeline will do , what I would want to see is a mix of matured and crybaby gundam pilots , and no more Godlike gundams , Gundam Series with " To kill or to be killed " scenario . I 'd love see ( the likes of ) Heero , Setsuna , and Amuro facepalming ( the likes of ) Kira and Banagher and that very facepalm would make those two into awesome killsome gundam pilots . <p> the setting are between UC0094- UC0095. after the event of Char 's Counterattack and before the Unicorn era.about a girl , who lives in small country that quite far away from the conflict between zeon and feddies. they live peacefully , until one day there 's a zeon person with his zaku , who fleed from the battle to hide from feddie 's zeon remnant hunt . he tried to hide at a jungle near this country . and like the other stories , they met each other , and argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , feddie 's zeon hunter ( a quite arogant and cocky dude ) come to this small country , and sweep the area . the girl scared , and the citizen agreed to bring the feddies to the zeon guy , to avoid any further useless harm . but before they did that , this guy show up with his zaku , and give up . they take the zaku away , but still that feddies dude started to shot randomly at the city , mentioning " all of them are traitor . they provide hideout for the zeon remnant " filled with anger , the zeon guy attack the feddies dude and after he destroyed all the feddies squad there , he come down and search for some survivor.the city was burned down . he desperate and bursted to tears.then he hide to the jungle where he hide before , to prepare stuffs and stuffs , and wow he met her on that place . yes she hide on the jungle where the first time they met.knowing that now they become fugitives , and the feddies back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothing to loose , and nowhere to run . so both of them , inside one zaku , doing the one last stand facing the feddies.did they survive ? or they died with hand holding each other ? well ... you guess it : ) <p> Rather than making a new Gundam Universe how about animating Mobile Suit Gundam UC 0099:Moon Crisis ? Not only do we get to see mass produced Zeta type mobile suits but also cameos of Kamille Bidan , Fa Yuiry and Judau Astha.Also we get to see Bright Noa and Mineva Lao Zabi.It can be a 4-5 episode OVA with Gundam Unicorn like animation.I do n't think many have read the manga and so it guarantees excitement and curiosity among the Gundam fans of Universal Century and other alternate universes . <p> Gundam Builders Championship : a battle tournament like G without super powers and lulz . A big battle royale . Only gundams accepted . In this plot , Gundam is a specifically designed mecha , only for the puporse to battle in the tournamet ... Then , you will see pro/big budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , country teams ... corporative teams , <p> FLLAY : the HEROINE ( strike pilot ) LACUS : the chilhood friend converted to the ANTAGONIST and reverted to future PARTNER of the HEROINE ( aegis pilot ) ATHRUN : the prink prince ... ssss No coments.KIRA : you know , , , he/she is the BITCH ! ! ! and must DIE in this plot . <p> a new series where : - a big organization called ZEONISPHERE start a war against all the world- THE WORLD ALLIANCE formed to defeat them- THE WORLD ALLIANCE 's AGS ( Advanced Gear System ) mobile suit series overpowered by the ZEONISPHERE 's ZACKs , their new generation of super fast &amp; agile mobile suit , thanks to their new built ZCC ( ZEON CORE COMPACT ) generator by their genius scientist- after 3 months of battle , ZEONISPHERE 's assault teams succesfully defeated 5 nations ( USA , Korea , Iran , Rusia , China ) - the protagonist , a member of independent force formed by a guy from Rusia , defeated by ZEONISPHERE 's assault team at India when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General System/GS suits ) - soon he discovered the entire team dead , but found there 's a GS suit still moveable and a box- he then open the box that contained a blueprint of a MS generator and bring it to their HQ- the MS generator is finished and insert it to a GS suit that fully modified by him using any part he need in HQ- accidentally , the HQ discovered by ZEONISPHERE and he fight back with the modified GS- the modified GS performance is ultimately beyond imagination but still ca n't match the ZACK- when he was about to being stabbed by the ZACK , his ' ability ' awake- his brain processing accelerate , the time flow looks slow- at this moment he control the modified GS that fully able to respond his fast control , evade the stab then slash the ZACK and destroy it- the scientist of his force that witness this call the modified GS a GUNDAM , a codename of mobile suit blueprint he want to develop , that the modified GS match the specification of it- then the new story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gundam series will be on TV ( less budget ) 2 . Target audience is 18 years or younger3 . Bandai wants plenty of milking opportunities for Gunpla <p> The Earth has become uninhabitable after centuries of war and humanity has advanced into deep space creating an uneasy alliance of planets . A young boy on a distant planet stumbles across an ancient Gundam ( 1st model kit ! ) buried in the sand that encrypts itself onto him when he touches it . Discovery of the Gundam sparks an arms race that eventually leads to all out war on a galactic scale ( different grunt kits for all factions ! ) . <p> Cut forward 10 years , the boy is now a teenager who still harbors guilt for finding the Gundam . One day his planet is attacked so he decides to steal the Gundam from a nearby museum where it is being kept to fend off the attackers . The Gundam recognises him and begins to move . It is more powerful than it looks and the boy manages to kill one of the enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight and the boy is promptly captured . <p> On the enemy ship he meets a sympathetic mechanic who upgrades the Gundam with the latest parts ( yay new model kit ! ) and then helps him escape . The boy and the mechanic then travel to a allied planet ( using FTL drive ) hoping to find asylum . Unfortunately they the military is a bunch of corrupt assholes and detain them . We meet another sympathetic character who is a hot girl and together they steal a ship and escape . <p> Branded outlaws by everyone , this ragtag group is joined by a couple other refugees they help save from a stranded ship and they decide to become bounty hunters . In the following months the boy matures as the leader of the group despite his young age and the mechanic continues to modify his Gundam ( woo another new model kit ! ) . <p> One day the group discovers an ancient map that leads them back to Earth . On its scorched surface they inadvertently release a evil mastermind with psychic powers from suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and steals their ship . After many months of salvaging old junk the group manage to escape the Earth only to find the war over and the galaxy ruled by the evil mastermind . <p> Allying with an rebel army of freedom fighters they fight a last ditch battle to take back the galaxy . The Gundam receives a fancy new makeover ( last upgrade kit ! ) and the final battle begins . Deaths on both sides until the boy meets the evil mastermind piloting his own custom mecha ( uber bad guy kit ! ) . He defeats the evil mastermind with both suits is heavily damaged . Epilogue scene of the survivors burying the damaged Gundam in the sand again . <p> How bout d story concept is like xenogears.At first , there is war between human and then as the story progress , it was actually all being plotted from the beginning by this evil machine ( self proclaim god ) created by ancient being and controlled and caused the war event via the human host.in dat way , it will turn the world into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devour all the life on the planet ( inluding the earth itself ) . About the hero character , he should be adult around 25 above and a mature type . His gundam at first is just the normal poduction type , a bit custom specifically for the hero but not so overpower , its d medium range combatant type ( turn to close combat type as the hero turn into berserk mode.and at dat time , the gundam also change into something horrifying-look gundam and overpower ) , but as the story progress , the gundam gain the ' divine ' power a gift from different entity ( the force opposing ' god ' ) and change into powerfull gundam ( powerfull enough to slay ' god ' ) . For the villain , at first it is human and during halfway of d story , its gon na be the human host ( controlled by ' god ' ) and the monstrous creature or mobile suit ( corrupted , possessed ) . <p> the remake or reimagination ( parellel timeline ) for After War Gundam X. The series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , setting and plot wise . It was unfortunate it came out at the wrong timing and thus underrated . Imagine this : First episode , the recreation of the scene where the apocalyptic colonies drop ( hundered and thousand of colonies ) by using modern CG technology and graphic . This gon na be the single most epic scene in the whole gundam series . I will elaborate more on my idea if this was chosen : D <p> Maybe Gundam wing endless waltz anime adaptation ... Or at least a story where gundams can control the pilot if his heart rate increases rapidly ( something like the wing zero maybe ) ; Gundams would not be normal mobile suits for war but lost treasures from an ancient civilization that are rares , All this thing with during an era like Final Fantasy XII for the design ( imagine gundams but in Rabanastre ; D ... ) ... Just add cool pilots that know the war like Heero or setsuna ( not faggots , sorry for the word , like gundam age pilots ) , add cute girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time for gundam series ! ) , funny and extremely shocking at some moments ( maybe gore and sad but with a cool end , not like gundam 00 with the movie ... ) It could be cool ! <p> Gundam vs an alien race ... I personally would like to see human technology going against an onslaught of aliens . People would say that sounds like Macross ... but hear it out:Sometime in the distant future , mankind after a series of devastating wars on Earth and in space has learned to finally live in relative peace . With its new enlightened vision of the future , humanity reached unprecedented cultural , technological and social progress . They began exploring space as an effort to better humanity . As humanity ventured farther and farther in to space , certain human colonies unknowingly trespasses the territory of an unknown alien race . A sacred planet is colonized and is seen as a desecration . Seeing humans as aggressive and with no developed means of communication , religious zealots of the alien race begins their campaign to expel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to plan an extinction event . An invasion was needed to eradicate the human horde . At this time , no known technology could match the superior alien army.Humanity is driven back to its solar system until a desperate act led to the development of mobile suits and proved that the new technology outperformed the most advanced human made weapons of war at the time of the alien invasion . Mass production begins and the mobile suits seem to have halted the advancing alien army . <p> Seeing this as another act of aggression from the humans , the alien race develops their own mobile suits which again break the stalemate as their awesome alien technology overwhelms Earths mobile suits . <p> Mean while , small factions within the alien race began to see the futility of the war they are beginning to notice that perhaps diplomacy is needed since the humans proved to be no match . Perhaps they have misjudged ? They tried to communication with the humans but were sabotaged by their own people bent on revenge same as humans who wanted revenge . Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans . Human emissaries are also sent as a final attempt to communicate with the aliens . They both encounter various obstacles in the way stopping them from directly opening lines of communication with each other . <p> Sometime during the war , an alien mobile suit is defeated and taken to be reversed engineered by the humans . The new technology from this is used to develop GUNDAM . <p> A Gundam suit is developed later more powerful versions or upgrades of it is developed . With its human-alien technology it drives the aliens back . During one major battle , humanitys armada faces the aliens greatest fleet . Only a few hours in to the battle , thousands of lives are already lost . The Gundam through luck smashes through the alien defenses and comes face to face with the alien mother ship . Destroying the mother ship would mean driving the aliens back to their solar system . The Gundam is attached by a fleet of custom alien mobile suits . It defeats them all but the Gundam is severely damaged . The Gundam sees one clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alien flagship mobile suit is advancing . The Gundam is about to fire about the same time as the alien mobile suit is about to cut it in half . But a cease fire is declared by both sides . <p> It would appear that communication between alien and human is finally established . Fade to black ... end . **26;181;TOOLONG <p> This explores:1 . Alien mobile suits ... a big break from human style mobile suits.2 . It goes into space ! 3 . It talks about the need for diplomacy and communication.4 . It hints on the need for cultural sensitivity and the futility of religious fundamentalism.5 . It explores humanity 's ability to reach amazing progress through peach and brotherhood.6 . Finally ... humans fighting non humans and not so powerful right away.7 . ALIEN MOBILE SUITS ! ! ! <p> This sounds pretty cool . But yes , it does sound a little bit like Macross , Halo , or what have you . But it is still interesting since the Gundam universe has not explored this kind of story before . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great ! But it seems just another rehash of the same Gundam plot based on Gundam UC or Gundam Wing . <p> Anyway , good try ! At any rate ... would like another Macross series if Gundam wo n't do a human vs alien storyline . <p> To Anonymous February 7 , 2013 at 2:28 PM - why do n't you post your own original idea since you 're so critical and appear to not even read the premise of the idea before commenting . You idiot . <p> How about a timeline not far ahead . It take place somewhere in the 21st century or 22nd , a country in South East Asia ( just to have 8th MS team esque jungle warfare , let 's randomly call it Isketambola ) is in midst of civil war between two political party extremist supported by foreign countries . There are tensions between countries during that time because of different views in foreign intervention affair . <p> Isketambola happens to be a country formed from two countries that used to be in war with each others because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to put a stop to the 100 years massacre by sacking of all the politicians with the help from powerful countries . The country was in peace because the UN army take control and led by a good UN Secretary General . After 30 years , they give democracy to the country by UN letting go the country and let the people vote . There were 4 parties with different sentiment . All is well because citizens were tired of seeing blood spilled . until politicians starts to do diplomacy with other countries to support their sentiment and the sentiments starts to brings the old scars back and create segregation and extremists starts to fight each others backed up by corrupted politicians backed up by foreign countries to protect their sentiment . That 's the background story . <p> Let 's start with the main story . Prof Auburn gave Sixto a blueprint of a small rechargeable energy generator that can power up a city for five months and is rechargeable . He do n't want to give it to his country ( Canterika ) that will use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isketambola to meet his old colleague to keep the blueprint for research to be use in the future for the good of mankind . <p> Sixto went to the place and met Arjunaidi who happened to be a Gundam freak , he knows that building 18 meters giant is far fetch . With the exo technology around he innovate them and create an OS that can let the exoskeleton learn from experience , movements and battles per say . He created two exo , for fun , not for war from scraps that he savage from deadman exos . The exos he built has no weaponry at all but have Gundam-esque design . He ca n't use the blueprint to power the exos because he do n't understand it at all . But they were hunted by the extremists backed by Canterika for the blueprint . So they use the exos to run away , and Arjunaidi starts to weaponize the Gundam for battles . But I want it to be unarmed for few interventions . and all the drama can be develop from here . Too long already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series in that time line . ( Like Zeta to 0079 ) <p> I 'm just trying to set up a timeline with countless possibilities like what Universal Century had done and the reason why many hails UC because of the point of views that it brought . Very wide , from tv series to OVA each have things to tell in different ways , different methods , with different agendas , and different point of views from different personnel yet connected while giving space for technology to evolve like mobile phones to smart phones and people can see the process . <p> Maybe the politics will never ever happen in real world , ( to have 2 countries at war combine into one by sacking the politicians and bring them to justice will never happen in real world . ) Maybe something need to be polished here and there , but I 'm sure about countless possibilities with the political background that I set . <p> We 've seen wars depicting space colonies wanting to be on earth , but , what if its the other way round that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to force the earther 's off the planet , the earth would probably be a dying planet and becomes inhabitable to some degree.A war that space colony is trying to calm the threats placed on it . <p> : History:2135AD A steady war engulf the remaining lands as sea level rises and the ice caps near gone . War seems to have frozen in time . Mankind developed Orbital colonies to avoid the extreme destruction of mother nature and war torn fight for landmass . <p> 2168AD Mobile suits were created to help rebuild landmass and is also used for military warefare seeing the advantages in terrain . <p> 2190AD Due to thriving and safe nature of the Orbital colonies , the earthers want a place in the Orbital sphere , united , they are known as United Federation of All Nations ( U.F.A.N ) . War is breaking out again , Orbital militia was sent to earth to destroy the armed forces of U.F.A.N. <p> -Synp-Amaryllis Dilan is a young ace of the Orbital military academy . Scouted by the special forces the moment she was graduated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 new types of mobile suits , Valkyrie Gundam . Her best friend is also recruited . With the remaining 3 , she deployed down to earth to tackle her first mission but a ambush takes the team by surprise and a Gundam of their own was taken , along with her best friend Argomone Fids . <p> With a newfound weapon " Gundam " in the hands of the U.F.A.N , they plan use it against the other Gundams . When Valkyrie Gundam faces Freyja Gundam , Amaryllis is forced to fight her friend ... <p> What about something like a secret war ? Imagine if you could a world where no one even knows if they 're on earth or in a space colony , the governments at hand keep the status of your life secret . <p> The story would focus around a mobile space colony that is seeking to reclaim earth ... and how are they doing it ? Video games . <p> The newest craze in Olympus ( stand in name for the colony ) is a high-tech super realitic war game called simply " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot of one of these " Great Machines " or " GM " for short ... but rumor has it in the gaming world that you can ... if your really luck get a Legendary secret Machine , a Unique variant ... whispers of something called a " Gundam " <p> The pilots would be of all ages and types as at first the " game " would only be known as such , then things will get serious when a " Terrorist Group " reveals to Olympus that the game is anything but , chaos ensues , lines are drawn , and many gamers join the " terrorists " in their goal of stopping Olympus from conquering earth and other colonies . <p> Simple story really , Humanity at the brink of extinction due to a very long running war against a terrible but relatively unknown " evil " enemy hell bent of the destruction of all life in the universe - The " last hope " is to construct a gundam and select a pilot , and fling them back in time to stop the destruction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent too far back and the forces on earth think of this gundam as the ememy - pilot is torn , faced with many moral dilemmas with the knowledge that something terrible is " on its way " . Has room for development I think , a final " twist " being the original " evil force " originated from the time-travelling gundam somehow " creating " that evil from the original hate towards him . What goes around , comes around story , kind of an " intertwined " timeline . <p> I would like a new system in Gundam and I 've created Integrated Mobile suit Pilot Utilize Link Superiority Element system ( I.M.P.U.L.S.E system ) . This system is very simple , it allows the pilot to connect all of the pilot 's physical anatomy synchronize with the the gundam anatomy , therefore the pilot can gain full control of the gundam him/herself , and the disadvantage of the system is when the gundam is damage one of the part of itself , it immediately send a signal ( impulse I assume ) direct to the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pilot him/herself.This system is basically like a human with power and extra ordinary abilities depends on the gundam itself and armaments <p> a world where gundam is refered as a GODall of the Gundam Pilot are Gods themselves ( pick you olympian name ) they rule over mankind , does whatever pleases themthen 1 of the Gods fell in love with a humanand abandoned his Godhoodand take a gundam with him <p> angered by his betrayal , after years of searchingthe other gods find him and finally kill him and his wives at their old age leaving his teenage son alivethen his son ride a gundam and vow to take revenge at the gods who kill his father and motherand so on <p> In the year 1989 AD , the world is changing at a faster rate as the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United began to thaw , a Mobile Suit transported down to our world <p> Tomino Yuuji , an 18-year old college student has stumbled upon a Gundam-type Mobile Suit called DBG-47-007 GU Gun in Tokyo , Japan , together with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GU Gun not only can make objects out of nothing , but it can alter the course of history . <p> It might be destiny for Yuuji to fulfill his longtime dream of piloting a Gundam , but he must face reality as he , together with Ryn , faces an unknown force from another dimension called the Excalibra Star Control Army ( EXSCA ) as well as the two superpowers from our world . <p> The Gundams are equipped with a prototype sensor that can read the pilot 's brainwaves to help improve unit movements.Of course there will be a mass-produced version to be equipped in ordinary MS too at later point , but the prototype on Gundams will also have a specific amplifier that can give further boost by detecting a high level of the pilot 's emotion.The effect will vary depending on whether the emotion type is good or bad . <p> There will be a secret antagonist faction that would be pulling the strings on most of the event in this series , and they 're equipping some of their pivotal units with a special barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that could break this barrier is an overcharged concentrated shot from a Gundam . Thus this would create a contrary from the common setting where the ' shield ' is instead used to invade and oppress , while the ' spear ' is used to defend and protect . <p> However of course this can not be abused often , as it obviously puts a great strain on both the Gundam and the pilot . If the attack is overused multiple times in a short time , it is not improbable that the pilot will die and/or the Gundam explode from overload . <p> A mobile suit from the future travels back to current time to destroy an alien ms that would upon being seized be used as a blueprint to advance warfare and threaten Earth 's longevity . But there never was an alien MS as the truth was obscured to the advantage of involved party in posession of the future MS . <p> The reported threat of possible alien invasion and the blueprint of the attained MS is used to kickstart an arms race that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile suits . Aliens never come , but mankind is its own biggest threat so the weapons are used in wars for political , economic , territorial gain . <p> The pilot is locked away for years . He manages to flee , uncovers the truth , but is assasinated before he can reveal the truth that would prevent his future self from traveling back . <p> Follow a financially well off ( at first ) band of " oppressed freedom fighters " from a country labeled as a threat and consistently attacked for various reasons , mostly resources . The band acquires suits from a shady party and their battles focused mostly on one opposing country 's military attempts of regional invasion/occupation go up the chain to unravel suppressed truths and media spins that keep war thriving . <p> The main cast 's age range from 20 - 40s consisting of strategician , pilots , mechanics , and an informant . Mobile suits are mostly grunt units . Awesome looking yeah , but not over the top . Urban , dessert , and jungle battles . <p> This fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side stories , sequels , prequels ) , but focuses on one group 's gritty story . The events prior to the time traveling MS are for either a movie or second season . <p> I want to see another 08MSTeam-ish story where the protagonist is just a normal soldier at war , piloting scrap suit without fancy beam cannons and power up . In addition , I want the story to be as dark as Victory Gundam where the entire team is annihilated except the protagonist , thus bringing him into the spotlight . I want him as an adult , not a spoiled 15 year old kid . No newtype , coordinator , innovator , generator , or refrigerator . <p> Good character development is the key ! <p> #1 BeginningStill between zeon and federation , I want the protagonist as zeon soldier who is very skilled at tactical war in space . He is in charge of zeon 's front line . While being a soldier , he is assigned to a team led by a veteran commander . I want them to pilot costumized zakus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has set up a base in the debris belt ( DB ) to avoid detection by the federation . In this phase , he participates in several battle scenes , gaining experiences as well as displaying his superb piloting skill . Missions : intercepting federation supply cargo intended for the moon base , ambushing patrolling federation ships , and capturing federations mobile suit factory found at the other side of the debris belt . Great chance to sufficiently expand other characters : the commander and other pilots in the team . <p> #2 ConflictAfter several successful ambush mission , the team are promoted as a special detachment team specialized in stealth and destroy missions and are set to reinforce zeons main fleet . Zeon plan a huge assault on federation moon base to gain control around the orbit . During this mission , their team is assigned to infiltrate the base undetected . However , en route to the targeted location , they spotted a suspicious cargo at the other side of the battle field . It is nuclear caches ! At the same time , they are found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor owned by the federation which assigned to defend the cache ( usually zeon is the one who has mobile armors : apsalus , alpha azieru and such ) . After a long desperate battle , the protagonist managed to heavily damaged the most of GMs and disable the MA at the cost of his teammates and the commander . He is forced to abandon his mission and retreat with his critically damaged zaku as the zeon 's frontline is surprisingly wiped out , thanks to the new model mobile armors assisting the moon fleet . <p> #3 ClimaxThe federation acts fast . With zeon being weakened by their failed siege mission , the federation move their remaining moon fleet to chase the zeons , outnumbering them . Zeon forces retreated to their grand base hidden in an abandoned colony . The protagonist , still being shaken by the loss in the moons surface , must fight once again against nuclear equipped federation fleet . Now , he is promoted as a commander of the debris belt team . Using his tactical ability , he moves his DB fleet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge war started close to the abandoned colony , he forced his fleet to fight towards the nuclear caches at the backline of the federation fleet to capture and backfire them to the federation . In the process , he managed to capture one federation carrier carrying the caches but lost his entire DB fleet . With the federation fleet being pinched in the middle , he desperately started the spare engines of the captured ship and set the nuclear missiles to detonate in the middle of the federation fleet , causing heavy damage on both sides but successfully forced the enemy to retreat . <p> Later , he found himself floating astray in the space before being found by a zeon rescue ship . Whilst regretting to lose many of his comrades , some by his own hands , he returned to zeon and become a legend for that era . <p> Gundam : Guardian of Space drifters. . . ex earth fed soldier using gundam to protect population in a wreckage large scale space ship . . . . they want back to earth . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hijackers , enemy remnants an unknown enemy ambush . . they just want back to mother earth . . . but some people in that space ship have other plan . . . genre sci-fi , mecha , thriller , murder . . cross over from gundam , event horizone , and predator . . <p> Re-post : There 's been a reoccurring trend in Gundam series over the years to default to U.C. story lines , especially towards the end of their run . For example , the entire 2nd season of 00 was a Zeta Gundam clone . The last leg of Wing turned into Char/Zechs trying to crash Axis/Libra into the Earth , a la Chars counterattack . Most recently , Age paralleled the abomination that was Victory , with loosely developed characters needlessly being killed left and right , along with a weak and undeveloped female supporting cast . Today , Unicorn is well received for its top notch animation , engrossing plot , developed and motivated characters , and most importantly the ability to present and execute new ideas by reflecting on the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to move beyond the limits of the U.C. story lines and take a look at the fundamental story that made the original series and its other popular incarnations great . At the heart of every Gundam series there is the basic story of a son/new generation piloting their father/forerunners mobile suit(s) for the sole reason of creating change in their world . There motivations , allegiance(s) , and purpose can all be fleshed out with good pacing of the story , a pilot viewers can personally relate to , and a world with real people and real issues . Specifically a world that is n't the backdrop for beam spam and political shenanigans ( looking at you Seed and Wing ) . Viewers should n't be forced to reach ep . 48 out of 49 to see all of the casts previous motivations , and personal development thrown out the window , then have it labeled as a plot twist ; that 's simply poor writing ( Age ) . Regardless of what happens people will continue to watch Gundam anime and film , buy Gunpla , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only by developing the world of a protagonist , and investing in the growth , maturity , and them and their supporting cast can the next Gundam TV series bring in new fans and retain the majority of older ones . <p> Repost reply : As much as I 've enjoyed Unicorn I would n't exactly call it original or groundbreaking . The show pretty much panders to old school UC fans and is not really designed to bring in new viewers . Mind you , I 'm not criticizing the show since they clearly know what their audience wants but I tried showing a friend Unicorn once and they were completely lost within the first 10 minutes . <p> For any new Gundam series in the future they need to stop doing the whole WWII in space angle , no more facist Zeon clones , no more gestapo clones , and definitely no more Vietnam war Gundam either . Start bringing the show into the 21st century by dealing with more relevant issues like urban decay , crime , economic crisis , oil shortage , world hunger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . <p> I 'm thinking on a gundam with a story similar to the armored core games : <p> In the future the earth is overpopulated , the food production is not enough for so many people , and the land and natural resources are a luxury . The governments see that the only solution is migrate to the space , but the cost of building a space colony is so prohibitive that no country want to take the initiative . Later the problem of the population becomes so big that some countries contract private companies to lessen the costs and build the colony.The mobile suit tech is developed by some companies to help the process of building the colonies , later they sell it to various armies as weapons and peace-keepers . During that time the power of some companies becomes so big that they start to influence governments and taking a monopoly over the colonies , later they start to impose their rules and at last they go in open war against the governments to " protect their interests " , and using more advanced mobile suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people all live under a contract with a company , where a person is an employee and live under they rules , and in exchange the company gives them food and protection. -------On a side note it will be really good if they make a tv gundam series with a ( non loli ) female protagonist , , and it will be better if tehy pull a " samus is agirl " on everyone . <p> " Skylanders " : Living in Space-colonies " Deepwaters " : Living in Sea-Colonies " Earthbound " : Living in a gigantic city ( Earth-colonie ) " Freelancers " : Nomads and people who are not living in one of the three big colonies <p> While the three colonies are constantly fighting and have wars , the " Freelancers " are the most hurt by this fighting . <p> So one Freelancer-colonie formed a new fighting machine from stolen parts and named it " Gundam " . With this machine the freelancers are now dominating the battlefields but now they become more and more aggressive and arrogant and so a big war beginns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month the three big colonies managed to build their own Gundam-like modells and the war beginns to become crazier than before . <p> That 's my idea but i havent managed to get it in proper order or to make an appropriate ending for it . ( ) Sorry for bad english ) <p> I 'm a massive 00 fan so naturally I would like too see a continuation of that . 00 left us with a deep space exploration ship , the Sumeragi and on top of that Tieria is on board . Humanity might have reached a state where there is no longer conflict but what 's to say the rest of the galaxy has reached that state ? <p> The Sumeragi could easily get caught up in an interstellar warfare between two previously unknown races . Not only does that present an interesting concept unique to Gundam it also presents a situation where there can be lots of interesting design work . <p> A new lead could present themselves and desperately defend the ship from this 1st barbaric attack using one of the work based mobile suits . Tieria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sumeragi manages to escape and heads back to Earth but at the cost of Setsunas life . In his last words he could ask the new lead to carry his ideals and find a way to end the conflict . This takes the ELS Quanta out of the equitation and motivates the new lead . <p> The Sumeragi crew members are shocked by what happened and thanks to our new lead eventually decide to head back and try to end he conflict . At this point the ship is loaded with new Gundams equipped with real GN Drives and heads out to complete it 's mission . <p> This plot would present the opportunity for a lot of unique designs and characters . Done correctly the plot would also be amazing and presets the opportunity for interesting relationships between the characters from both the Sumeragi and our warring fractions . <p> It is the year PT ( Post TerraFormation ) 332 . Over 500 years have passed since humanity began to grow beyond the confines of Earth . To counteract its over-burdening population , the worlds leaders ventured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets in the solar system , creating new-earths throughout the stars . For the first time in human history , generations have gone without war and humanity has known a pure peace . That was , until the year PT 300 . Due to errors in the terraforming process , the outer planets had begun to deteriorate , threatening the lives of everyone on the planets . Instead of helping their citizens , the central government turned their backs on the outer rim , and zoned it off , writing the planets off as a lost cause , dooming all the inhabitants to a desolate life devoid of support or hope . This act caused an uprising , and began the first galactic conflict . The outer rim launched a rebellion , rising up against the government that abandoned them . 12 years have passed since the war began , and consistently the central government has managed to beat the rebellion at every turn . But now , a group of scientists in the central government , allied to the rebellion , have given plans for new mobile weapons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer rim , in hopes of bringing a swift end to humanitys first war in the stars . With the Gundams , will the outer rim finally be able to win their war for survival ? <p> those images are awesome .. it 's like Gundams from another universe or galaxy .. and that 's what i want for the story .. i want it to involve crossing of dimensions or galaxies and unmanned Gundams as inhabitants .. kinda like the transformers .. where there are Gundam Cores where humans need to tap into to bind with the Gundams and control them and move as one .. <p> i basically have this plot in mind .. it 's also like my voice over of the story i have in mind if it hits its pilot episode .. hahaha = ) <p> " Life on other planets . " " The mirror is a portal to another dimension . " The truth is n't really that far from these beliefs . <p> A few galaxies away from our own , lies another planet that houses life just as Earth does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , planet Threa is their home . Only in their planet , they are not the dominant species . They are servants to their masters , called Gundams . Cold , giant , unmanned , godlike machines , ruthless and oppressive , rule over the humans . They have no heartbeat , no pity over the humans . They rule with tyranny and threat . And the humans , small and weak compared to them , are ants , following their orders , making metal for their masters . These was their life in Threa , until they die of service , and their children would live to suffer the same faith . <p> But life on Threa was n't always as cold and cruel . Over ten thousand years ago , humans and gundams lived in peace . Both sharing fruitful lives together . And those humans who are chosen by the gundams as their masters , share a bond stronger than blood , and those gundams with this bond with their chosen human counterparts , are known as Sentinels , guardians of planet Threa . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy , that Threa lost its life of peace . Scourges from planet Rathe invaded Threa , defeating the Sentinel Gundams ( Sentinels ) and taking over the planet and the humans , for their own supply of humans in Rathe had been depleted . <p> And now , as the humans of Threa slowly decrease , Scourge Gundams ( Scourges ) plan to invade the next planet that houses life , Earth . And it is up to one slave and his friends to revive , and re-bind with the Sentinels buried deep in the grounds of Threa . They must find a way to tap and reconnect to the gundam cores of their ancestors ' Gundam counterparts , to stop the scourges , reclaim their once peaceful planet , and save Earth . <p> =D <p> and the gundam would basically be like the one shown above , it 's a Sentinel to be specific .. and the Scourges would be darker and demonic looking . kinda like the Decepticons .. <p> In an era where the NewType population has increases greatly the colonies are plagued with race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart as brother fights brother for the right to survive . The Federation signs the NewType Regulation Act granting Catharsis , a mercenary group with heavy ties to Dr. Albenrook 's " Judas Initiative " , the power to restrict man 's evolution for the betterment of civilization . With all the violence against NewTypes the Outer Ring Survey Group opens its doors to any refugees . Years later from the asteroid belt The Irreproachable rise with retribution in their hearts and a legion of immensely capable NT pilots . At the heart of their power are the new TrailBlazer Cannons , weapons capable of delivering a massive payload unerringly to a target using psycommu manipulated I-fields . With their elite unit known as The Peerless , The Irreproachable seek to shift the balance of mankind in favor of NewTypes . But is a world where NewTypes rule OldTypes any better ? Questions like this hang heavy on the mind of young pilot Rung Arhat , who finds himself at the controls of the Tidal G , an experimental mobile suit of immense ability . A Gundam capable of manipulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold unmatchable power . But within it is a dark secret , the calculations for developing the Minovski Pulse Wave , a weapon that can change not only the direction of the war , but mankind 's very destiny . As he outruns both sides of the war who seek such power , Rung must discover who killed his father , a discharged Catharsis pilot , and what purpose his mother plays in The Irreproachable 's final plan . Should man deny himself genetic destiny for sake of stability ? Or shall he be rightfully oppressed by his evolutionary superiors ? These questions and more will be answered in New Mobile Suit Century : Gundam Ascension , and its inevitable movie sequel Flanagan 's Folly . Airing this Nevermber at 99Am NotaDay .

That is how the journey will begin , it will end by Ren-Exar-Droma having to make the decision to even fight at all , questioning the very personal and moral beliefs such as honor and pride , yet at the same time questioning war and the prospect of how to win a war .

But before they can leave the battlefield their alliances ( the colonies and Earth ) call upon them for one final and decisive battle , the two then make the decision , independently , to fight in order to show humanity the ugliness of war . During the battle Ren-Exar-Droma and his friend meet , while they are fighting Ren-Exar-Dromas mobile suit gets blown up and he gets ejected out tearing of his arm and leg .

That of a mobile suit designer for the principality of Zeon . I know MS Igloo did a testing team 's perspective but I would like to see a series explaining what happened to msv suits and why they were not used in the war .

I know its too much to ask , but it would be refreshing to get a truly darker version of a gundam series , ala the Battlestar Reboot . On the Flip-Side , however , I would also love to see the Builders mini-series fleshed out into a full Season .

Elsewhere , on the Moon , The autonomous zone of the Selenic Republic ( SR ) , created mostly from the descendants of the survivors of the hostile nations which started the nuclear war , are developing their own Mobile Suits . The leaders of the SR , as fiercely independent and zealous as their ancestors , feel that it was the agenda of the FSC to cut their access to the resources of the Earth that they feel they are entitled to , and for now bide their time until it 's time for retaliation . <p> Synopsis , First Episode : 0112 NCE : War erupts as the SR launch their campaign against the FSC , by gassing the capital colony . <p> 0113 NCE : Our protagonist , a twenty year old daydreamer with a talent for machines visits the FSCDF base on his home colony to visit his childhood friend , an officer ( Lieutenant JG ) . She chastises him for not making anything of himself and suggests he offers his talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have before the war started and references the damage done to the Earth by " the stupid people who could n't share " . In the mean time , knowledge of the Defense Forces new experimental Mobile Suits was leaked and a team from the SR are sent to retrieve information on and steal , the experimental Suits . Back at the base , Our protagonist talks with his friend as they look at the Mobile Suit training . Suddenly , the alarm goes off and the soldiers are called to defend the colony as they are under attack . The protagonist is left , being told to find shelter before his friend leaves to defend the base . Seeking shelter , he wanders into the hangar , and comes across three mobile suits : the Gundams CODE : Blue , CODE : Red , and CODE : White . From the SR Ship , someone gets a visual on CODE : Red . <p> I always wanted a series where it 's a post-apocalyptic world . Where everything is destroyed and life on earth is struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new group called The " Zereste " they are rogue savages who got there supplies from others . There mobile suits were salvaged from underground bunkers and spare parts . Plus , they have a powerful intimidating masked leader named " SIR SVALATA " piloting is custom salvaged close-combat mobile suit SAMS-00-X Dominion . But a young lad aims to stop the oppression of his people and find a way to end the conflict of every people . When he stumbled upon an abandon mineshaft where he saw a very damaged mobile suit that needed repair and that suit is called a " GUNDAM " with combine effort with his friends they were able to repair it . They called the gundam SAMS-XX-1 Felgrand but it still lacked weapons because it only had a broken sword called " Delta blade " but the gundam gets weapons and guns and armor i every battle at some time they finally made a group called " Windraiders " . <p> A young engineer 's colony is attacked by a military army . He escapes bringing with him the blueprints of a mobile suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young mercenary . The young mercenary pilots a grunt mobile suit as his personal suit . The engineer asks the mercenary for protection . They travel together and find a ruin , which was once an abandoned military facility . They make this their makeshift base to complete the mobile suit in the blueprints . However , their base was found when they have already completed the suit . The mercenary was defeated due to the overwhelming numbers of the enemy . The completed suit has a special ability and it fuses with the grunt suit , forming the gundam . The mercenary beats the enemies . <p> They travel together meeting other people . Many groups hear about the completed suit , wanting to get their hands on it . In their travels , they uncover many secrets especially about the military . <p> 20 years after the events of victory and humanity was starting to recover after years of war they decide to focus on medical studies and restoration of earth but when a nanobot is used to find the cure for cancer and other disorders a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold war breaks out over the new technology and the reformists take colonies by hostage and use force to keep them under control but it turns out not all the nano bots were destroyed data was collected from the remains and used to create a new mobile suit dubbed the " gundam infinity " but this broke the treaty there was leaked info on this suit and it was hidden away later conflict breaks out to get the suit and a boy named Imadori gets the suit passed down to him by his father the lead of the development team.the reformists send a ships to attack the colony group that Imadori lives in he uses the gundam to defend his colony and joins with the argama V they contact the league military on earth and tell them to start rallying forces meanwhile they start to head for the drop point where they will drop to earth and meet up with the federation/league military forces at their hawaii base and attack the reformists base but they are ambushed by enemy forces and a makeshift prototype mobile armour they battle and overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lands in the Atacama desert he is taken in by a local who turns out to be a former reformist pilot named kyoto until he found out about the real motives of their higher ups but barely escaped a " mop-up " operation on his crew.He seeks revenge on the reformists so he helps Imadori get back to the hawaii base but when they get there the base is demolished they find some survivors and they learn while they were gone the base was attacked by reformists and the forces had to retreat to space <p> they modify mobile suits ( via the infinity 's nanobot system ) and head to space but Imadori is captured by the reformists he learns that the reformist leader is his brother sagara who was thought to have died in war ( he takes on the form of char in order to make the people follow him ) he tells him his to finish what char started and tells him that it is their heritage because they are the heirs to zeon and he wants to repay the federation for suppressing the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says it 's apart of his plan to restore zeon through the genesis project and force people to move to space he asks Imadori to join him but Imadori refuses he is put back in a cell meanwhile they take data from the infinity and reverse engineer it into two new units a mobile suit and mobile armour . Imadori is broken out of prison by kyoto and they head back to the moon where the rest of the Argama crew and their forces are rallying troops and freeing the colonies but this angers sagara he starts up the genesis project the space fortress genesis ( the reformists main base ) is launched and gets dangerously close to earth the argama V fleet heads on it 's way to countter attack the fortress the fortress get 's near low orbit around earth pointing it 's mega particle cannon at the colonies while in position to launch at earth . they threaten to fire unless every one surrenders but Imadori does n't give up he uses the infinity particles at a large scale and uses them to camouflage a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two groups one to destroy the cannon and one to disable the thrusters on the main base meanwhile he heads to confront his brother and kyoto follows they encounter the mobile armour and kyoto tells imadori to go look for his brother and he leaves imadori confronts his brother and his brother uses his infinity system to advance his ms imadori does the same sagara sets off the thrusters early causing the base to fall at a fast pace and he and imadori continue to fight then suddenly the full potential of the infinity system is unleashed and it causes a message to be sent to all the monitoring systems world wide about why the infinity system was created and the wars of the past and why it wont help to fight most of the zeon forces turn on sagara and accuse him of lying and using chars name in vain they try to help push away the genesis but it 's no use imadori defeats sagara and absorbs his infinity system he then tells the enemy forces to retreat and he uses the particles to help him push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particles as giant wings and tries to get extra thrust the particles let him hear everyone 's thoughts he hears their thoughts and does n't want to let them down so he puts more strain on the system causing the gundam to fall apart to the bare psyco frame and is able to push away the genesis he returns to the shipepilogue:There is another treaty created this time to ban mobile weapons they create two gundams the turnX and turnA to represent humanity 's turn to a new era of peace all the people of earth and the colonies are moved to the moon and become the moon race they use the gundams to destroy the remaining colonies and to destroy all modern technology on earth and send a few million volenteers to restart the human race starting with tech from the late 1800s . They hide one of the gundams on earth and the second on the moon so if it happens that earth is ever in need of protection the gundams will be there . <p> gundam infinity IP-01-1specs:The base is a modified hi nu ( without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive and nanobot system ( the prototype system for the turn a/x ) it is armed with two multi-purpose beam sabres , vulcans in the head and a gattling gun similar to the alex 's on its left arm it has a beam rifle and solid rifle a beam shield ( built in both arms ) , two solid bazookasa solid automatic rifle and a hyper particle mega launcher ( but it can only fire three shots then it deteriorates ) support mobile armour based off the dendrobium <p> Systems:the infinities nanobot system can give infinite clean energy to the unit and is like the age system in a way but the unit can change its armor in the middle of a battle without support from the ship.it can also take enemy weapons and use them e.g. funnels. the system also allows for it to be used like wings of light and can be fused with the minovisky particles to make after images the nanobots can create an advanced i-field and regenerate the gundam they can also make it appear invisible and it can teleport. the draw back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot so it has to be used moderately . <p> I think something away from the normal would be much more interesting . Look at the past three series , not to say that any one of them were bad . BUT , they are rehashes of previous shows . SEED and SEED Destiny were remakes of UC ( loosely ) , 00 was a re imagining of Wing and AGE , well AGE was a cluster of every Gundam ever . I really think that just because something is called something , does n't mean it has to resort to the same formula . Like others have said I would like to see something post-apocalyptic . In my mind as I see it , start before the apocalypse , look at how the world and technology works , focus on what leads up to the end . Look at who is at fault , why it happened . Then follow the man or woman ( woman would be cool for a change ) who was ordered to begin or end the massive conflict . Explore the PTSD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future being a couple different ways , look like Steel Battalion or something like Kamen Rider Kabuto . With a company that helped perpetuate the end running the world through monopoly of supplies . I would like to see something other than a military with suits , this would add a sense of urgency with supplies and a decision on whether to mobilize or not . Give it a deep personal conflict connect to a few people as opposed to many . Design wise , post apocalyptic mad max style Gundam would be really cool . This is all I can think of right now , but this is my personal idea of what I 'd like to see <p> Outside a group of Gundams acting as aggressors , 00 was nothing like Wing . The story was completely original for season 1 and the movie . Also did n't Setsuna have PTSD and survivor 's guilt for most of the series ? But yeah , I would also like to see a return to the post-apocalyptic setting but it seems that fad kinda died out after the 80s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were still rehashes of the same concept . I just want to see something different . I did n't see Setsuna as having PTSD or survivor 's guilt , it was more of a drive to change the world due to his experiences . If he truly had PTSD , we would have seen him break down more than he did . He seemed kinda stable minus the whole I am Gundam thing . Yeah I keep coming back to the post-apocalyptic thing since it has n't been done for a while in Gundam . Plus mad max Gundam would be awesome . I 'm kinda getting tired of the overpowered god suits too , I want to see something a little more grounded in reality , as much as gigantic robotic combat suits are grounded in reality . Anyway , I 'd really like to see something exploring the dichotomy between races , armies , people , etc. before and after the apocalypse ; a look at how humanity survives and adapts . Any-ho , these are my dreams of a mecha series , so yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were killed when she was 8 years old , " Uncle " ( actual father ) took her in . " Uncle " was a veteran MS Pilot of The Skybridge Fall-War . Towards the end of the War , " Uncle " found a blueprint of a Gundam and saw a 2nd Battle Ready Gundam in the hangar . " Uncle " sees an opportunity-even so stealing anything while at war is punishable by Death . " Uncle " had a baby coming into the World , just wanted a safe future , took the blueprint and the Gundam and was presumed KIA . 3 years had past and the World now is Leaderless , Aimless and Vulnerable . Bad people want to seize this opportunity . " Uncle " still hiding but kept a watchful eye towards his baby as she grew up . 2 years later World/Life is basically revolves around Corruption . Armies with MS 's are under the control of people with MONEY &amp; POWER . Rebels with MS 's are not fighting to save the World but rather fighting to see tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich &amp; Powerful and giving political propaganda to the citizens of a " HOPE DRIVES US FORWARD " . <p> 3 years later-Country/World War Torn , " Uncle " taught her everything she needs to know , even how to pilot a MS . They grew fond of one another . One night " Uncle " was doing some late night reading of past archives , found out the 2 Gundams are 2 of 4 Gundams said to BRING FORTH LIGHT IN THE MOMENTS WHERE SHADOWS HAD TAKEN HOLD . " Uncle " found his own HOPE ... <p> More to come if liked and sorry for the long post . I really hope the new series will be AWESOME . <p> I personally would like them to re-animate or animate old Gundam series ... just like what they are doing with the original Gundam series . <p> Char 's Counterattack should be the next one ! Reanimate it in the same quality and " realism " as Gundam Unicorn . Additionally , expand that universe by showing the HWS , Hi Nu , and Nightingale in action as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prototypes " ... they can have Amuro and Char pilot the Hi Nu and Nightingale sometime during the movie in which they both destroy each other 's MS as one spectacular MS fighting scene . This forces them to retreat back the Nu and Sazabi ... so the ending remains the same as the original . <p> Also somewhere in there ... do a quick scene in which they have engineers making schematics of the Sinanju prototype - based on the idea of combining the best aspects of Sazabi , HWS and Hi Nu - so that it links directly to Gundam Unicorn . Make it some kind of anniversary thing and release it with MG Sazabi Kai or MG Hi Nu Kai or MG Nu Gundam HWS Kai ! <p> Bandai should also finally animate Gundam Sentinel and Advance of Z ! <p> They also need to reanimate Victory Gundam , ZZ Gundam and Gundam F91 in the same quality as Gundam Unicorn ! <p> Yes , all you said is correct but what the guy wanted was just just wishful thinking . Smoke some ganja and chillax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightingale are noncannon ... but it 's the owners of the brand who can decide that . Plus if you read it properly ... the guy clearly mentions that these super robots you hate so much gets destroyed . Ca n't be godlike if they get wiped our ... right ! ? <p> The year is 3044 AD ( After Destiny ) War was fought between the Earth Federation and the spacenoids . Both sides escalated in the war path by unleashing destruction weapons . Nukes , mobile suits , and mobile armors . Lives were lost and there was a peace treaty established . The Earth Federation disbanded and there were 5 colonies established with leaders . These 5 leaders established the peace treaty . Those 5 colonies names were ; Fier Colony , Bier Colony , Gier Colony , Yier Colony , Wier Colony . However peace never lasts too long and there was more to the story . The war had taken its toll on population and worlds . Yes worlds . The Earth was set into a nuclear winter and Mars was set into a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 to be exact . They were called ; Fjhir , Ghjir , Bhjir , Yhjir , Whjir . They were all brothers and each had different views in the war . They piloted 5 legendary Gundams . Those Gundams would be unique to each brother and they had powers of the elements . Fjhir piloted the RED Gundam known as F201-Volcan Gundam . Ghjir piloted the GREEN Gundam known as F202-Golem Gundam . Bhjir piloted the BLACK Gundam known as F203-B.M Gundam ( Black Mist ) . Yhjir piloted the YELLOW Gundam known as the F204-Mhjonlar Gundam . Whjir piloted the WHITE Gundam known as the F205-W.M Gundam ( White Mist ) . Just as how the heroes were connected the Gundams were as well . They were as you could believe brothers . Each shared their powers and could combine into the ultimate weapon . The weapon that caused the destruction and the end of the war . For you see these were no mere Gundams . The war was before the AD years and the technology was at its pinnacle . Using historic blueprints and Gundanium alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . The colors stated the type of powers they withheld . RED had the power of the fire , GREEN had the power of nature , BLACK had the power of the seas and of unnatural abilities . These abilities were never controllable however so another Gundam had to be designed to tame or put the BLACK Gundams powers in sleep . That would be the WHITE Gundam . The WHITE Gundam was majestic and had the powers of the heavens . It is a mystery how these powers were obtained within the Gundams but rumor has it they were designed with mysterious shards . These shards had the powers of the elements and somehow they were combined into the designs . <p> Now the story begins in 3044 AD . The 5 legendary heroes are actually the ones to establish the 5 different colonies . The colonies were linked together to form a balanced natural life for their people . However nobody can live for centuries . The heroes had sons and daughters and they continued the line . Each had yet to realize they were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom . The Gundams were destroyed before AD in the war however they are going to appear soon in their lives . The 5 heroes had great great grandsons . Each carried their names . <p> The story of how the Gundams were destroyed has to do with BLACK and WHITE Gundams . You see the BLACK Gundam was never really meant to be made . When the engineers obtained these shards they had 6 shards . Red , Blue , Green , Yellow , White , Black . However when Black Mist was made instead of merging the BLUE shard into the core the BLACK was merged . They never truly anticipated the powers the Gundam would have . There was no data on the BLACK shard . However they did know the WHITE always negated the BLACK shards mysterious dark effects . Dark effects like bend the human 's mind into darkness and to turn into a blank slate filled with the need to destroy . These were one of many abilities the BLACK shard had but were strained due to WHITE negating . <p> To cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different among the other brothers . They were always connected in a different way and these Gundams enhanced these differences . Long story short the BLACK Gundam eventually turned Bhjir into a blank slate craving destruction . In a long battle Whjir revealed the true form of W.M to remove and destroy the BLACK shard from B.M. In order to cure Bhjir , Whjir took the BLUE shard and merged it with B.M 's core . As such it cured both B.M and Bhjir . B.M then changed into a new form with the abilities of the sea and weather . However it also had the abilities of darkness and stealth . It was actually believed to be the strongest Gundam within the 5 always . The brothers joined with the newly renewed B.M to form the ultimate weapon . F200-Caes Gundam . As the name sounds it had a majestic and deity like semblance . The heroes destoryed the Earth Federations colony laser and put an end to the Earth Federation . As such they formed the colonies and the peace treaty with the spacenoids . <p> Now going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they were going to be a part of a larger picture . For you see BLACK shard was never truly destroyed . It only shattered into smaller pieces and were scattered across the space . The BLACK Gundam would make a reappearance .... <p> The Gundams were claimed destroyed after the war . However the heroes had hidden them only their families knowing their existence . Now in 3044 AD came an unknown attack . One day after school the heroes ' sons were enjoying a day after school when a blast came from the sky . In came a black mist . Many saw it in shape of a " Gundam " but they were n't sure . <p> The sons had to join together to ressurrect the 5 elementals from the sleep . This is the story of <p> the year is after colony 3030 . A organisation that goes by the name of GHOST has taken over earth forcing 50% of the planet 's population to move in to space to get away from the cruel dictatorship.the hope of the people will come from an anti-terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gundams to take back their home and their freedom . <p> Plot : It was the present year 2013 were mobile suits does not exist and only exist in our imaginations and on the tv screen or atleast that 's what they want you to believe , in japan the japanese government was secrectly researching and developing mobile suit since the past decade and Oji ( protagonist ) the head of r&amp;d in mobile suit , soon created a prototype mobile suit and named it Gundam , but the secrecy of this project did not last and soon leakage came out informing the other countries , considering this a huge threat to them they formed an alliance , they infiltrated the japan 's base where the gundam was currently being developed and stole the blue prints of the prototype mobile suit , after a short period of time this super power countries were able to develop their own mobile suits and created their own prototype gundams , the alliance soon was broken between this super power countries and the war started ( WW3 ) at the same time the japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tried to mend their mistakes by eliminating all data that links to mobile suit developing by using a newly developed prototype mobile suit called " anti-Gundam " this anti-gundam is not a gundam but different kind of mobile suit that is developed just for the sake of destroying gundams , which developed and piloted by our protagonist Oji , and soon the japanese government formed a team which it 's only purpose is to erase secretly everything that is related to mobile suit , and return the world to what it used to be where gundams only exist in our imaginations and on the tv screens . <p> Here 's my 2 cents ! In the year 30XX ( I do n't  know , somewhere in the future ) , the rich uses most of the earths resources . Basic items of need become too expensive to afford . Middle class families become low class families . People are evicted from homes . What used to be lively neighborhoods become emptied lots . Eventually only two class remains : the rich and the poor . The poor become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . The rich breaks out in war against other countries for resources . Poor people of the ages of 25+ are used as expendable soldiers . For the purpose of saving resources , all parties exiled the use of nuclear weaponry . Regular war machines are no longer practical . Japan creates humanoid mobile suits . Other countries follow up with their own variations.The story of our character begins in the power hungry country of The United States . Engineers ( the rich ) provide resources and direct supervision against the poor to assemble the suits in guarded chambers . Among the assemblers is 22 year old Guy ( let 's call him guy for our male protagonist ) and his partner in crime , 20 year old ( well say Robin for our female protagonist sidekick ? ) Robin . Two thieves whose developed a hidden passage way to bypass security to steal suit parts to upgrade their out of shape mobile suit ( which is named Gundam ) in hopes of being able to flee from the oppression and live a life of freedom . I could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script . here 's an overview : They flee and become pirates ( steals and loots from the rich ) , but not too soon they run into old enemies . Comes across the insurgence . Fights for the insurgence against the rich . Meets new enemies . Fights in the war against the countries to bring in peace . Meets old friends . Meets guy with mask . Some action here and there . Character development here and there . Blah blah blahwould like to write more but I could be writing my psychology paper . <p> i kinda have a idea that 's ive been working on for a whilekinda based off of SD Gundam G Generation , SRW , Gundam X and Turn A Gundam <p> long ago the earth sphere is ruined by a devastating warcenturies later after a very slow recovery the Federations and the Space Colonies discover data from the great war 600 years agothey call LT ( Lost Technology ) both side has data of mobile suits that are way advance then the current ones they have ... only the EF has data to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful mobile suit called " Gundam " the EF later demands the Colonies to hand over the LT they possessed but they refusewar soon broke out and it ended at a stalemate <p> decades later another war will soon rise and a young newtype will be drag into ithe will pilot a Gundam created by his grandfather and fight not only to end the war but to discover the truth the war 600 years ago , the LT , the Gundam , and himself . <p> LT is pretty much data from past Gundams gathered , by a group of people who traveled though parallel universes that gathered the data , that that got leaked by the main antagonist to the world where the story is set in 600 years ago <p> the Gundam will have the G-System installed along with some newtype tech like the Bio-sensorit wont allow anyone use but the MC to pilot the Gundam . G-System is allow the Gundam to travel to parallel if the pilot is n't the type that will abuse it powersits weapons is a beam rifle , beam cannon mounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beam saber like the SUMOS Heat Fan <p> the upgraded form has thrusters on its legs and booster mounted on its shouldersit also has a Full Armor configuration has heavy armor with anti beam coating , missile pod on the leg and chest , and 2 double barrel beam machine guns mounted on both armsit can purge it armor for a high speed and mobility mode <p> Gundam would be call EXMS-00 Proto-EX Gundam or the Mark EX <p> pretty much based the Gundam after the Mudrock Gundam , ZZ Gundam , AGE-1 Starks and the Wildwurger from SRWkinda been thinking of add stuff from Layzner like the Knuckle Shot and V-MAX <p> the main character would be bit of a loner . he would be like 17 years old maybe a little olderhe is both kind and calm but can get violent when angeredafter receiving his Gundam and he joins the a Colonies to fight against corrupted Federation and a unknown enemyhe does n't get along with his fellow pilots ( except members from his unit that he belong ) and get into a lot of fights <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ... either a fiery tomboyish tsundere , a kind older sister type who can be extremely scary when angry , or a stoic princesskinda leaning toward the Older Sistershe would have a nice figure and big breasts lol <p> the main antagonist will be a amoral super computer , called Mother System by its underlings who were raise by it , who is responsible for the wars that happened in the centuries ago and again centuries later . it was created centuries ago and it purpose is to help humans to evolve and advanceit believes that humanity requires war to advance and evolve . that survival of the fittest is a essential for humanity . its controls the EF , manipulating their actions with the help of her " Children " . <p> still got alot of thing that still needs alot of tweakingplease forgive my poor writing skillstoo lazy and tired to proofread <p> I would love to see another focus on the common grunt Gundam series like 08th MS team . I loved ' normal ' characters that did n't have these super newtype powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joes fighting the big war and their common machines that could have a Gundam or two in the mix . Maybe an OVA series focusing on OZ soldiers or the Karaba Air Force and such ? That would be cool . Gundam always has interesting side stories to tell , they need to start bringing some of the magic of the past back ( 08th MS Team , Stardust Memory 0083 , War in the Pocket 0080 , etc ) <p> Taking a background story similar to Gundam Age , the Gundam is created as a means to end a brutal conflict that drags on for years and years . However , instead of resulting in a lasting peace , the Gundam and its pilot are used to subjugate the colonies and crush any potential resistance . The Gundam becomes a symbol of despair instead of hope , and it remains as such for years . <p> While this corrupt world remains unified for a long period of time , the government becomes lax and eventually fractures form within the leadership structure . Politicians and military leaders attempt to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faction that possesses the Gundam , however , becomes dominant , completely sweeping aside the opposition , the same as how it did during the old wars . Several of the remaining factions , however , form an unsteady alliance and pool their resources in a desperate attempt at resistance . While it seems as though their cause is hopeless , one faction manages to steal the incomplete plans for an old Gundam prototype . while it is nowhere near as powerful as the actual Gundam , it leads to the development of a mobile suit that gives them a fighting chance against the Gundam . <p> The resisting alliance will be the protagonists , but the reality will be that neither side can really be considered the , ' good guys . ' Both sides will be struggling for similar reasons-control of the Earth and its outlying colonies-but the protagonists will be joined by resistance groups and will therefore have better intentions than the Gundam-faction . If only marginally . <p> For alternate ideas , I think something that is yet to be done well is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovades are human-based and the ELS just were n't a good opposing factor , so they do n't count ) . So the most likely candidate for such an enemy would be quantum computer similar to Veda . The difference would be that it would have no human elements and have the overarching purpose of ' protecting ' humanity . This AI would have a very vague definition of ' protect ' and would attempt to fulfill this purpose through any means possible . <p> Picture this : Several Years into the future , Gaia , a previously unheard of organization , introduces a new form of energy called Gundarinium , with a means to perpetually generate it . Additionally , there is a means to convert that energy into certain types of matter . Put those two together , and you get pseudo-infinite matter , a virtually limitless supply of materials . This has a dramatic effect on the world , with an explosion of technological development . Without having to rely on what mother nature can provide as the basis for all of humanity 's needs , Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowly engulfing the surface of the Earth like creeping moss . <p> Eventually , overpopulation and " over-creation " lead to humanity moving out to space , creating 12 colonies each named after a month of the Gregorian calendar . For a time , mankind 's issues seem to be under control . Then without warning , Gaia , the organization which has the largest sphere of influence on mankind , the ignition and guiding force towards humanity 's technological advancement , disappears , along with the secret towards the continued production of Gundarinium . <p> A decade passes , and being deprived of what was previously considered an endless resource dealt a massive blow to mankind . Tensions are high , and the reserves of Gundarinium are steadily depleting . Scientists scramble to either find a way to produce more , or find a suitable substitute . <p> Due to careless management of resources , the June colony Mounts an attack on the May colony in a desperate attempt to obtain their Gundarinium . They use modified space worker machines called mobile suits , and gradually proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and some of the other colonies attempt to retaliate by counter-developing their own mobile suits , and the war rages onward . In the midst of it all , Charlotte Tempest , an engineering student on Earth , receives a strange message about her inheritance from her father , a scientist who was murdered for unknown reasons . It gives the location of a certain warehouse , with the access code , where she will find more answers , and where the Gundam will be waiting . <p> " Gun .... dam .... ? " she asks to no one in particular , reading the message on her computer , alone in her apartment . Suddenly , repeated explosions are heard are in the distance , steadily increasing in volume and proximity . In a spur of the moment decision , she decides it 'd be a right then and there that it 'd be an interesting idea to look into that letter . <p> Oh , in terms of mechanical design , I ca n't really explain full without having to scan and upload my sketches ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands out is some areas of the mobile suits , especially the hands , are coated with a material that mimics muscle and skin , so they look somewhat biological , like giants with armor , although not on evangelion 's level . Additionally , like in Muv Luv , instead of panoramic screens inside the cockpit , the camera and system feeds are projected directly into the retinas of the pilot , which just seems more practical to me . To make things more different , aside from being a female protagonist , she 's also left handed , and equips her Gundam the same way ( Hats off to Mr. Bushido ) . The antagonists are merely using the invasion of the Earth as an excuse to search for the Gundam , the black box of which contains the secret to the production of Gundarinium . In Reality , it 's the Gundam 's reactor which was the source of the Gundarinium , and Charlotte works with the remains of Gaia to find a way to extract the Gundam 's reactor without triggering the reactor 's self destruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supernova , and seek a way to dispose of it , since she considered it 's presence like a drug to humanity , thought to be needed , but in reality detrimental . <p> Does it really matter if the next Gundam series is over-the-top super robot or gritty down-to-earth real robot ? I could care less about these trivial , superficial things if the story and characters are good . I think fans should be worrying about story and characters first rather than appearance . <p> Something I have always wanted to see is something of 08th MS Team for Zeta . We spend the vast majority of Zeta Gundam seeing Space Battles on the Argama , but at Kilimanjaro , we see that Karaba has been strengthening their forces and fighting a ground war with the Titans . I would love to see a team working with Nemos and Rick Dias suits fighting desperately against a Government they do n't trust . ( Maybe they could get a tricked out MK-II to round things out . ) <p> The team would be fighting ground and mid-air sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the higher ups try to garner support from a few Federation politicians that are n't corrupt and even forming uneasy alliances with Zeon hold-overs who still maintain some footing on the planet . <p> Zeta is an epic , but there are so many parts of the Gryps War I 'd love to see explored more thoroughly . <p> Once upon a time , planet earth is filled with animals . All animals lived happily . But everything changes when human nation came ...... They destroy everything and try to take rule the earth . That make animals strugled and run . But there 's one human " Tio " that does n't want planet earth get destroyed by evil human nation . So he join with the animals alliance . Then animals lead him to some place . There 's ancient machine that build by animal ancestor that called GUNDAM ANIMAL . Then Tio gained trust by animal 's king to be the Gundam Animal 's Pilot . So with Gundam Animal , Tio try to kick some ass of evil human . And they 're cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived happily ever after : Dhttp : //kurniawan.wandah.com <p> Would be fascinating if Gundam made a story which focuses on an arms race <p> Prelude : Humanity has advanced to the next stage . With the majority of disease and poverty eradicated , modern science has reached its peak and humanity has build utopias under a single governing body and enters a global age of peace . Only smaller terrorist groups in isolated parts of the world and criminal organisations remain . With this age of peace , humans have started to take peace for granted , and yearn for something more than this sterile utopia ... <p> 15 years later as the world looks to space for a recently discovered mineral Ellanium , old organizations like nations have come out and started talks for independence . Rallying for different causes like rights over resources , the public has sought conflict in the guise of friendly competition.Eventually , the world 's governing body is dissolved , unable to properly function with its own members backing their different organizations . The world is separated again and media is censored from opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions focused on the advancement to space for Ellanium . Our story follows Koura Shin , a mobile suit designer working on developing prototype suits ( GUNDAM ) to fully realize the potential of Ellanium . Assigned to her team of engineers are 3 ace pilots competing against rival Gundams to eliminate the rebel terrorists . <p> ------------ <p> That 's the starter plot , eventually war breaks out between the 4 factions but the battles are fought in secret . With much of the battles used to serve as propaganda or show the factions power and to win over citizens and more cities to join their cause . <p> Koura is recruited for the NU , aiming to advance technology and fully utilize technology to serve mankind . While another faction would be to evolve mankind similar to the Zeons . <p> The story very much revolves around Koura modifying suits and creating new weapons to use against the enemy while keeping the pilots safe . That said , the story is focused on the whole team and not just Koura . It 's very much like Stardust Memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have establish human manufacture and have enslaved these worker for there benefit , and a civil war started for the rights and protection of these enslaves . An ex-scientist who help started the human manufacture testing has fallen into guilt and with help of the rebel human right army they created a gundam to help fight for the freedom of the enslave.A young boy , who has friended with a young enslave boy , accidentally got involve with the war and was given the power to use the new gundam the people and end the war . <p> history base gundam series =D ... or like in a post apocalyptic earth where resources have almost been depleted ... most of civilization went to space to colonize ... and the ones that are left are enslaved by a corrupt gov't that conspires earth to the colonists that earth is no longer hospitable ... but some have escaped this enslavement and lived on deserted locations and try to survive with what little resources earth provides .... some fight against the gov't ... along with colonists who learns the truth about the conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a coded plan that was made hundreds of years before the depletion of resources ... that can bring earth back to it 's former glory .... and with this he also finds a gundam that can decode this plan .......... soon the gov't finds out about this and so ... the battle begins ...... the gov't uses mobile suits to control the people on earth .... btw ... idk xD <p> 2 . If the new series is a multi-generation one , make sure that the successor of each previous main character(s) are not directly related . Main characters should at least 15-17 years old and above . It 's extremely annoying to see main character(s) which are too immature emotionally and physically . <p> 3 . There should be other space colonies within the Solar system near the orbit other planets such as Venus , Mars , Jupiter , etc.Make as many factions as possible , each with their own distinct agenda . <p> 4 . Apply the advanced version of the available state-of-the art technology such as artificial intelligence , mind-uploading , etc . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been obsolete decades or even centuries ago . <p> 5 . Make sure that there is no such thing as " pure " good guys and " pure " bad guys . Everyone have their own motives and ambitions . <p> There was once a country .. a country that had the most systematic political status , stabilized economy and leading military assets . It could have been considered a perfect country that would lead the world today . However , the country later suffered an economical breakdown . Despite all efforts of bringing back the country back in its prime state , all seemed lost . That situation had led to major change in political affairs and all resort to the Phoenix Operation . The operation that involves turning a few other countries into enemies that will result in political and economical reset to the country . The present day .. nine years have passed since the operation began , the war with several other countries have lead to the extreme of consequences . Scientists of that country have been experimenting weapons in the remotest place but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young man encountered a weapon .. an experimental weapon . A mobile suit . <p> I 've got one that i 've been thinking about for a while now . It 's not totally original but ideas mixed and mashed from everything i 've liked . ( and someone had something kinda similar in the part 1 of this post ) <p> Years in the future , you have colonies throughout our solar system ( even on other planets e.g mars , jupiter etc ) and just like the normal gundam story line - some/all the colonies eventually war it out for independence/resources . All these different fractions have specific types of mobile suits and specialised tech ( how original ! ) <p> After years/decades of stalemates and mini wars , a large fleet of aliens attack both colonies and earth 's alliances . Their tech is superior to everyone elses ( abit like AGE at the start ) and all sides are hit with major losses and confusion runs wild . <p> Meanwhile on a neutral colony ( i 'm thinking Mars or anywhere that you can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars and remained politically neutral had only focused on quality of life ( think post WW2 japan kinda culture or ORB in Seed ) and harnessing the best of technologies ( with new found minerals/resources on mars ) lead them to having an army with tech that can repel ( but not totally beat ) the aliens ( also because Mar 's army is n't burnt out from all the wars , they have a large , fresh and battle ready fleet . IMO Mar 's Mobile suits are the gundams . <p> Slowly Mars is pressured to help out Earth and the other space colonies , being the correct thing to do , Mars shares little by little of their tech with the other fractions and eventually everyone 's army tech is ' decent ' enough to battle these aliens . <p> The twist to the aliens ( kinda like AGE LOL ) is that they are humans which ventured beyond our solar system decades ago and are thought to be killed-forgotten . In their travels , low on supply , not able to turn back to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they encounter other alien life - i 'm thinking ELS-ish or Macross 's Varja or even transformers decepticons-ish which leads to them being corrupted/allied with them and thus going back to our solar system for revenge/stop the war to rule over what they see us as inferior beings . In my head they would now appear like the borg from Star trek ( human , cyborg , alieny ) except with unique alien mobile suits and earth's/our solar system struggles would be very much like how they portrayed it from the star trek movie ( if i 'm not mistaken , watched it so long ago ) So from all the intense battles with the aliens , our mobile suits tech is significantly progressing through desperation but only to be countered by the fast evolving alien tech too . But our protagonist from Mars works to understand this alien tech and incorporate it into his gundam thus turning the tide - final arc time . <p> It eventually leads to something similar to 00 story where we all have to put our differences aside and work together to survive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the story but i think the concept is quite solid and exciting . <p> A young student who just graduated from college and is now in search of a job . His father was a former project manager in a company specializes in military technologies . Upon his recommendation he finally able to secure a position at the company as technical engineer for a new project associated with the Allied Military . The project was to explore further advancement in robotics for military use . Within the project , he befriended an Allied Military officer who were commissioned to be the test pilot for a machine which will be the new form of armed infantry , conceptualized as mobile suits . <p> The effectiveness of these mobile suits were so great it begin to become a mainstream weapon as many military-based entities and countries began development of their own and so the war of mobile suits between nations and armies had escalated and bring greater damage to the world . <p> The young engineer , while continuing his effort to improve the mobile suit concept , sees this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions , he began to question his involvement in the concept . The Allied test pilot , through various combat trials and in real battle , begin to understand the value of human lives and began to show his respect and honour towards the enemies and tried to keep innocent people out of war . <p> All is at peace between Earth &amp; space residents.One day , a young , MS mechinic named Val witnessed an assasination of one of the highest ranked officials at that time.Then when he was chased by the assasinators he was rescued by " Seres " , a cew of former military agents , one one of them being a former Lieutenant , Hansen.The rescue was a success but Val soon realises that he is in BIG trouble when he found out that he is now also being targeted by the unknown assasins . Seres &amp; Val then works hand in hand to intercept &amp; prevent the assasinations &amp; killings done by the unknown assasins.Hansen entrusted Val his latest creation , the GUNDAM , the unit developed by the lieutenant himself after being relieved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Val was separated from his family at only 1 year old.His father is a soldier whom he never had a chance to meet &amp; her mother already passed away when he was just 11 months young so he was adopted by a man who owns a junk &amp; mechanic shop . His fate interwinding with the unknown assasins &amp; Seres , &amp; becoming a GUNDAM pilot will change not only his destiny but for humanity as well . <p> The peace disrupted &amp; now the Earth &amp; Space residents are facing a big trouble not only caused by the unknown assasins but also from the small to large scale rebellions &amp; coup d'etat that will happen which will cause another conflict between the two residents . Will Seres crew &amp; Val will be able to handle them ? They have the GUNDAM , all fate is with them . <p> After successful testing on Mars , turning the red planet into a magnificent blue and green jewel , everyone expected Earth to be next . At last , the slowly failing Space Colonies could be abandoned . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , and the nearly-dead Earth and overcrowded , rapidly deteriorating colonies are desperate . They pool what technology and recourses they have left to create a ship , the battle cruiser Prometheus , it 's compliment of all-purpose mobile suits , and it 's three primary defenders , experimental new suits known as ' Gundams ' . <p> It 's a race against time as the Prometheus and her crew rush off to Mars . Their mission : to overwhelem the Olymp Usurpers , the top 100 richest families of Earth and their people who prevented the terraforming ship Torchlight from returning and made Mars their personal paradise . <p> Will the Gundam pilots make it to Mars and reclaim Torchlight before the colonies fail and humanity becomes an endangered species ? Or will they be crushed by the weapons and people dedicated to keeping Mars clean and pure of ' Earth Filth ' ? <p> My idea is having an alternate timeline:1970 , mankind has just started colonizing space . Mobile workers are created to aid with satellite assembly and maintenance . 1979 saw the birth of Gundam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , Mobile suits as they are called in the series . <p> By 2010 , a 2nd generation of mobile suits are created by the Mobile Creations Factory , a giant company with practical monopoly over the mobile industry . As every nation seeks to become independent from MCF 's technology , MCF creates it 's own secret army , attacking research facilities all over the globe . <p> A coalition between the US , Japan , and South-east Asian countries have successfully developed several prototype units in Myanmar , Cambodia , and Vietnam . <p> Hikaru Abe , the son of a military official visiting a factory in Myanmar gets caught in an attack and is forced to use Captain James Tien 's custom Fenghuang unit with the injured soldier as a guide . <p> Hikaru and the crew of the Zhuque must survive and retrieve the remaining prototypes from Cambodia and Vietnam and silently travel to the newly fortified United Nations center in Geneva , with proof of MCF 's atrocities as well as the technology to match MCF 's advanced mobile technology .... <p> There 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big businesses and monopolies taking over the world <p> Another note , the main character only gets a Gundam ( Unit 00 ) as a mid-season upgrade . Unit 00 is based on **33;209;TOOLONG , having extra equipment for certain situations ; Flight and Artillery . <p> Unit 02 is also compatible with 00 's packs but since it was stolen , it gets a high-speed heavy armor version as an upgrade . <p> I 've imagined this initially as something like a game where the player can either get a unit that 's capable of combining with other units ( Gundam Unit 01 ) or get a custom mass production unit ( Fenghuang ) <p> today trend is on comedy . so why do n't  make a series where the funny scene takes place mostly at the " relaxed " part ( where pilots simply relax after a fight ) yet awesome fighting scene in the war.With 3 friends , a protagonist of a hot blooded idiot and easily gets angry ( like Edward Elric or Momotaros ) , a playboy fellow pilot ( like Urataros ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same face expressions ( like Agent K from men in black ) with his cheerful childlike 18 year old girlfriend that is very attached to him and always mistaken as an 8 year old due to her ridiculously tiny size . also with a tomboyish girl ( for the protagonist ) , a hot lady ( for the playboy ) and strict but funny captain . <p> Just imagine a hot blooded Kira Yamato with a tomboyish Lacus Clyne , a playboy Athrun Zala with a hottie elegant Cagalli and a stupid wise man Shinn Asuka with a 8 year old sized Lunamaria Hawke.And the best part where the three best friends watch HENTAI in their gundam cockpit . <p> What I would like to see is a Christian End Times Thriller . In the vein of the Left Behind series but with Gundams . The Bible talks about a War in Revelation that will wipe out a large amount of people during the rise of the antichrist . So I think it would be awesome to animate that war with Mobile Suits . There is potential for sequels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be great to have a live-action Gundam series or trilogy with realistic special effects like the modern sci-fi movies nowadays or at least a cool 3D movie . i hope Hollywood or the big movie companies adopts this idea and create a movie to raise awareness and hype up the Gundam industry just like the Transformers. everybody knows optimus prime and bumble bee but not gundams. some even call gundams as " tranformers-like robots " . i really hope that this could happen in the future .. <p> Countless Eons ago , a fleet of autonomous ships launched from a withering Earth , as the last of her inhabitants brought forth ruin . Those ships set out into space in search of habitable planets , carrying only the great and disastrous history and seed of mankind . One ship landed on a planet that would be known as Orbitras . The year is E.D. 0000 and the humans of Orbitras are following in the footsteps of their ancestors , seeking to expand into the cosmos . <p> At the turn of a new age a new world government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly built space colonies . The lower class masses are deported from Earth by force ; whether by using military force to harass civilians , by destroying entire cities and towns , or by destroying the lives of individuals by wiping their history . But not everyone will go without a fight . As the first wave of ships leave for space , riots break out across the world leaving panic and destruction in their wake . A terrorist organization calling itself the AMO claims responsibility for inciting these riots . Armed with giant military machines known as MS , AMO launches a series of surprise attacks on space ports , military bases , and government centers . In a single fell swoop AMO captures countless space ports and military bases , and assassinate several high profile politicians and world leaders . The New World Government does n't  hesitate to declare war , and in the ensuing battles a third of humanity is wiped out with much more left helpless as civilization breaks down across the globe . <p> Follow the story of Cecil , a young girl who joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the story of Karres , a na+ve young soldier who has been selected to pilot a revolutionary new MS known as Gundam . Watch as they clash on the battlefield , fighting to determine the future of humanity ! Can the humans of Orbitras overcome the cursed legacy of humanity , or are they doomed to repeat the mistakes of their ancestors ? Find out in Mobile Suit Gundam : Genesis ! <p> I have a general idea of the plot and specific characters but I wo n't get into that unless people are interested <p> My idea of the next gundam series:instead taking place in the future , it will be set in alternate universe AD when space programs and technological progressions are much , MUCH faster than ours . There are five main factions , in which three of them are power blocks ( Global Defense Coalition , Sovereign of Vepr Union , and Non-Block Federation ) controlling the space colonies and parts of mars , a terrorist organization ( Sombra del Fuego ) , and a military corporation that have its own PMC division ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dangerous cold war that decided the fate of the world survival . <p> the conflict are revolved around territorial dominance , influence , technology and resources wars . and each factions have their own internal conflicts , betrayal , and taking advantages of each others . <p> the Gundams in this universe is a modular mobile suit platform used by GDC for testing experiemental equipments and cladenstine operation which would deemed dangerous and very secretive so it 's existence in-universe is protected , questioned , investigated , and hunted by both allies and enemies alike . <p> The series begins with GDC and NBF diplomat who are tasked to negotiate truce with SVU suddenly attacked by SVU soldiers while on the way to the Iapetus Colony , leaving dozens of diplomats and soldiers guarding the officials killed and injured . both GDC and NBF accused SVU of violations of diplomatic protocols . But SVU denied the accusation , defending themselves with a proof that they did n't command the assault and accuse the terrorists instead for not wanting peace between power blocks and sabotaging the process . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three power blocks . <p> the main character is the a former gundam pilot POW who are thought to be dead with his team but suddenly found during a raid that goes awry in a space factory that turns out had a prison facility , revealed by a prison uprising . When he was found , he was joining the uprising and helps the team with a gundam that was actually used by one of his friends . <p> His survival became an investigation , and layers of conspirations starts to reveals ....... <p> As peace prevails , warriors like the White Fang was no longer needed so he was given a forced retirement by the Governor . As time passes White Fangs fame and glory vanished and made him insignificant and a drunkard . Stoned , his anger got the best of him and he decided to break into a military base to steal his Gundam . With his Gundam , he destroys the base with superior skills and in the end , with blood in his hands , he took on a mask and swore vengeance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude of my story . I find this storyline interesting and new as a Gundam series since the leading character is n't the good guy or some accidental hero but about the bad guy and how it happened . Deception , power , emotions , betrayal , and uncovered truths will be the twists of this story . You will love and hate it at the same time . : ) <p> I have no title yet for the story . I notice that the common trend of Gundam titles comes from the name of the lead Gundam suit . The first Gundam is n't the main suit of the story but a new one . The Space Colonies have developed 3rd generation mobile suits and was used against the White Fang . Getting over his head , White Fang gets defeated but manages to escape . His anger grows but fate manages to get him a sponsor and builds him a new mobile suit , " Gundam ! " <p> I 'd like to see a Gundam series which , like AGE ( Arc 1 ) covers the development of mobile suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keys-in-the-ignition scenario which turns a reluctant hero into the wars savior , the protagonist will a ) be female and b ) already be a pilot . <p> In the greater theatre of war , I 'd like to expand beyond the Earth Sphere to include the Asteroid Belt , Mars , and perhaps the Jovian system . The idea is that each area has been successful in their own independent economies , but the Belt and its rag-tag collection of settlers and spacers is tired of getting raked over the coals by corporate middle-men and declare independence . The Martians , who are now the center of frontier commerce while the Earth Sphere is bogged down in corporate tradition , send hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy the Belt . They are successful in this endeavor and set their sights on the Jovian system . <p> Our protagonist is a young materials engineer who uses mobile suits to gather resources in the atmosphere of Jupiter and the depths of Europa . Much like the Zaku , mobile suits are used as pressure armor to harvest the very necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out the space station she works out of , and most of her friends , except the few who are out harvesting with her , are killed . <p> Her team limps their way to Callisto , where their mass-produced construction suits are outfitted with basic weapons and armor to attack the Martian capital ships and avenge their friends deaths . Their sortie is highly successful , during the course of which they capture a cargo transport which is carrying experimental ship weapons and armor plating . Their suits are re-fit with these experimental armors , and the captured cargo ship is converted into a moveable weapons plant . They recruit a small team of pilots from the other Jovian moons and start making their way to the Belt to drive the Martian threat out and join the Belters in their desire for independence . <p> Earth and Mars realize that this means no more precious Helium-3/Deuterium from Jupiter and a full scale war inevitably breaks out . <p> The gimmick with the suits will be similar to AGE/SEED , where , adapting the different weapons tech which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one suit will have a rail gun . Another will be heavily armored . Another will use plasma cutters for asteroids as weapons , etc . The idea , however , is that all suits will fundamentally be the same chassis . However , using found parts and later upgrades , the armor kits will change in one way or another ( and so will the GunPla . Let 's be realistic , here ) . Like older shows , the rebellion on the part of the Jovians and the Belt will be for independence from corporate ownership and control of resources , pushing for autonomy over serfdom . The themes will rely heavily on the desire to be free and part of the human race version a cog in the machine . The Gundam team will also encounter political strife within its own ranks , as some are challenged by loyalties to their homeland/family/etc . <p> The masked character ( because there must be one ) will be Darth Vader-esque in appearance a former Jovian miner on the protagonists team who , after a terrible accident in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care . After the war breaks out , this person campaigns heavily for the use of mobile suits in combat versus capital ships , and is a junior officer in the first Mobile Suit battalion the Earth/Martian alliance deploys . This persons costume will be a stylized normal suit which never allows them to reveal themselves . In fact , it is n't until they cross paths with the protagonist in combat where it is finally revealed who is underneath the mask . <p> A potential success for the Gundam franchise lies in creating a modern successor to G Gundam . I do not mean to say that Bandai needs to adapt the tentative 14th Gundam Fight into the canon , nor do I want something as experimental as G Gundam was . The genres have been blended enough over the course of the last decade and Gundam does n't need to contribute to that pool right now after the failure of Gundam AGE . Instead , the use of mobile weapons in sporting competition should be revisited to tell a new story about the nature of human conflicts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits pilots compete against one another in one-on-one and team-based duels to earn fame , fortune and glory . Corporate sponsors handle the bills for successful teams , and the best pilots can afford to have the best tools at their disposal . Rather than revolve around mobile suits performing martial arts techniques , the pilots of this universe use traditional armaments ( energy and solid munitions , etc. ) in the vein of Mechwarrior and Armored Core ( the latter will probably influence the style of the show more ) . <p> There will be no special systems or gimmicks beyond the normal array of technology found in the late Universal Century . Human beings with seemingly preternatural abilities ( a la Newtypes , Coordinators and Innovators ) and remote weapons are acceptable , but in moderation . The action should focus less on these sorts of plot conceits . The mobile suits should be treated less like walking plot devices and more like proper machines that must be operated with a high degree of skill . Gundams should generally perform higher than most other mobile suits , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gundams could duel other Gundams later on in the series and we could still enjoy watching cleverly-written fights where the better pilot emerges the victor . If a Gundam overpowers another Gundam explicitly , it should be used as a growth point for the protagonist so that he or she can grow more formidable as a pilot . <p> The story must inevitably involve a global conflict , as all Gundam stories are apt to move towards . A war breaks out between the earth and space , and both sides begin to recruit these mobile suit ' athletes ' to come and fight for their cause . Many will join up with a cause for the benefits it confers as well as the chance to taste the thrill of a real war zone . As the spirit of competition becomes distorted , the protagonist and his team are forced to make a choice : will they embrace the Gundam as a weapon of mass destruction or defend it as a symbol of honorable battle and sportsmanship ? The idea of what it means to be strong and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as consequences of unchecked ambition . <p> Bandai loves to market the hell out of its properties , and this new series will be no different . Advancing the concepts pioneered in Gundam AGE 's part-swapping Gundams and the GAGEing Builder toys , the Gundams of this new series would be designed around easy customization . Bandai could sell weapon and accessory packs much as they are now but with the same wide variety that Kotobukiya offers with their Modeling Support Goods and AC Variable Infinity lines . All mobile suits would be able to share a wide variety of parts and weapons with one another ( with some exceptions , because having the entire Gunpla catalog being super-similar is a great way to alienate discriminating customers ) , basically allowing Bandai to bring kitbashing into the mainstream in a way that only Koto was able to prior . <p> I hope this idea sounds appealing . I 'm not sure if I really care about winning the prize , but I do want something like this to happen . I remember the original five-minute IGPX shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like it belonged in the Gundam universe at some point or another . <p> Throughout the various Gundam series , conflicts have always revolved around corruption , deceit , and misunderstandings - where humans in their universal dream to secure their own livelihood and happiness squander the efforts of others . Struggles of power bring life to war and raging emotions further fan the flames , inevitably consuming the innocent that had the misfortune to be caught in its path . Many of the Gundam series come to the point that peace will only come when humans transcend their personal borders and reach out to understand one another , but how this can come about is also a conflict when one debates the nature of man as an individual ; Are men inherently selfish to the point that understanding is not possible , or can men reason and learn to love one another ? <p> This is the classic Locke and Hobbes debate we see as the core plot in Gundam through all the iterations of Char and Amuro : humans are evil , or humans are good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the wishes of each individual are in harmony and attainable without conflict and though we may have a universal understanding of peace , the conflict most definitely lies on how we attain it , but we must first understand ourselves . If humans are inherently evil , then we need to strive to evolve and become something better the " Newtype " with superior cognition and emotional understanding . But a paradox is reached ; if humans are evil and selfish , we can not be a " Newtype " . Char likes to think that we have to kill off the humans to further our evolution . However , if humans are good , we will eventually become the Newtype we look to be and there will be no paradox because nature will sort itself to be this way . Amuro likes to believe this . <p> Then at the end of most Gundam iterations they always come to the conclusion that humans have the key to their own prosperity and hint at some way that as we progress into space , we will become a Newtype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars . <p> But is this really true ? <p> What if we move beyond that question of how to become a Newtype . So far we have only seen plots based on becoming a Newtype , with all the other political drama sprinkled around here and there about how humans are stupid and what not . What if we set a world in Gundam where humans have already attained understanding and enhanced cognition - how will this roughly translate to a better world ? The question will then be , " Is peace really attain by only compassion and understanding ? " . Obviously , this can not be the case , as everyone has different needs and wants and there are only so many ways and resources to go about satisfying people , so I 'd like to modify that question . <p> " To what extend does compassion and understanding bring peace ? " and " How much of selfishness is entitled to you . " <p> For my Gundam story idea , we can set a world to reflect that difference as part of the backdrop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep space , they developed into beings that have all the traits of the general Newtypes of other shows : understanding and enhanced cognition and motor skills . The setting will be , naturally , in deep space , on a large ship/colony of some sort with an Alcubierre engine to allow distant travel and the story will follow a young protagonist living in a nice utopian Newtype scientific society . <p> But before you scream its starting to sound like Toward the Terra , being a Newtype does not entail loss of individuality , which is a main base for Toward the Terra or other utopian stories . Since Newtypes understand , there are no conflicts from misunderstanding , diversity , or culture , unless that culture or diversity has a negative impact on the wellbeing of others . <p> So how would a conflict begin ? Conflicts will be based on resources . A ship/colony in drifting in space will run into problems here and there with self sustainability that will cause a drop in resources . <p> Yes , this is very original . <p> Being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corruption can still occur even if everyone understand each other . In fact , this will be especially true considering it will be easy to tell the state of mind your opponent is in . It will all boil down to " I understand , but I want to live and I want my family to live . " We cant possibly love everyone equally even as Newtypes . Everyone has a role they play . <p> So going back to the more immediate story , we will follow a protagonist living in a Newtype ship/colony drifting in space for the sake of science ! ( exploration and research based on real world concepts ) Let 's make the protagonist a girl for the sake of diversity ; a daughter of a scientist on the ship . On top of that she will be in her late teens as much as some of you despise teenagers . Her default name will be Cecile , sounding like ciel of the sky , but actually based on latin word meaning blind . I just pulled this name out of my butt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can change . It is irrelevant . <p> But for plot sake , we will make her NOT a Newtype ! <p> As one can imagine , in a society full of Newtypes , being born telepathically blind is more than hairpullingly frustrating , especially for teenager who 's just dabbled in the affairs of becoming an adult . I think this would be quite interesting to evaluate ; how her personality develops as she 's missing something fundamental . Will she be strong headedly stubborn like an Asuka ? Or depressingly emo like a Shinji ? Will this story be like Evangelion ? OrIdeon ? <p> Wait a minute , where the hell is Gundam in this Gundam Story ? ! <p> A Gundam can be used for symbolism in so many different ways . I 'm more interested in making it look more realistic and limited , rather than Messiah powerful . Plus , in this story , what need is there for a military war machine on a ship of science ? But anyhow , Gundam and MSs will be there , but in limited numbers for the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration exploring things like meteors , comets , asteroids . The will also serve as construction hands/space walk missions outside the colony . <p> So how will they be fighting with explosions and pew pew laser beams ? <p> Well , for one , once the colony could encounter problems in engine shut downs due to the nature of their Alcubierre engines , consequentially doing harm to life support of sustainable systems like farm and water . People will eventually become uneasy after weeks pass of no progress . Most of the story I 'd imagine would be psychological , but there will be points or a point where MSs will be stolen to gain the upper card . Opposing forces can be split by family and friends , or departments of the research team fighting other people with family and friends for the sake of surviving on the ship . <p> Our protagonist Cecile , may have been training to be a pilot for exploration ( Since she prefers being alone due to her deficiency ) and somehow gets dragged into putting out some unrest . Along the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group over another . Majority vs minority etc . <p> Perhaps even an encounter with Aliens ( In the Buff Clan/Human style ) in the middle might spice up some things ( They may help the colony or destroy it ) , but if I go on any longer I fear I may be writing the whole story . <p> Anywho , that about sums up the story idea thus far . The length of the story will be rather short ; I would think it would be a 14 episode short series or something of the like . It will concentrate on how being a Newtype grants or does not grant peace , and what necessary conflict means . If written , I would like to focus on human interactions and conflicts amidst a common goal of science and progression . The Gundam will be more of a devil , than a savior in this story , wielding needless power . <p> My series idea ( developed over a few years ) concerns themes of the concept of nationality , with perhaps remembrance at its side . Basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's land by another , something that has come as a surprised to the one since relations between the two have always been friendly . Since I live in Canada , it began as a question of what would happen to Canada if someone in the U.S. revived the concept of manifest destiny , with the States attempting to seize control over all the American continent , and there were giant robots . However , the only thing keeping the enemy at bay however are the Gundams , first implemented during previous wars , a weapon only developed by the victim state . The primary protagonist is a young soldier ( ie. not a teenager , someone in adulthood ) who finds themself now having to pilot that first , somewhat-antiquated Gundam , requiring two pilots to effectively control due to older tech ( this would perhaps change later on , but I think the idea of double pilots needs to be explored more ) against modern suits . The protagonist 's mentor would be one of that Gundams original pilots , who should be a very old female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure at this point ) . They fight alongside 3 or 4 others , at least one of which should be a woman , who pilot modern Gundams , all of whom are slowly defending their shrinking boarder at separate points , allowing introduction of them as individuals before coming together to work as a team , helping to evacuate areas that have become battlefields . They ultimately meet up at a ship that will take some evacuees and important persons to space ( you really cant make a Gundam series without space travel ) , the launching of which would signal the climax of that first act , ending with the total takeover of the victim state . With the series , I would hope to tackle questions of what it means to be a state or a nation , so it would examine how whether they lose that if they are taken over , or challenging the notion of nationalism , or fighting for your country , which I would hope I would tackle with an enemy soldier who ends up interacting with one of the other Gundam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what his own country is doing . However , it would also take a look at how the civilians from both sides feel about the conflict , something that I would like to eventually lead to a civil war within the enemy state , which would be the entrance for the Gundams to reenter the conflict in space , since the state would control colonies in space ( cant forgo those either ) , ultimately entering the third act as they return to Earth for the final parts of the conflict , wherein perhaps one or both states end up abolished ( havent ironed that out yet ) . The Gundams also should not be the sole reason anything changes , ie. The war does n't  end because of some speech from the pilot , as ultimately , war is not won by a person , but by people . I was also hoping then to tie-in themes of remembrance into nationality , especially how nations remember and pay respect to their shared past , and see how memories or experiences shape a character and guide their actions . Mech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be tamer than usual for the franchise ; no part swaps , or remote funnels , and no satellite cannons . Their should definitely be no newtypes or coordinators or x-rounders as I believe that would take focus away from the conflict between peoples and shift it to how individuals and skill affect the tide of war . I know having Gundams kind of takes away from that , but I would hope to prevent that by showing how there is a whole support structure of people around each Gundam and not just its pilot that allows them to be so effective ( mechanics , scouts , supply runners etc . ) . The idea still needs work , but I feel that the concepts I presented here could make a good base at least . Maybe not very crazy but I feel it might take it in a slightly different direction than other series . <p> Far into the future Mankind has colonized dozens of other worlds outside of the solar system through the use of near faster than light colony ships and jump gates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers who work on terraforming potential planets for colonization and to build the 2-way jump gates that are true methods of beating the speed of light ; allowing for 2-way travel between solar systems and ease of travel for the richer elite of Terran Republic to move to their new worlds . <p> Located 50 light years from Primoris the hub world of the TR ; in the orbit of the star 3777 Cerberi is the world Londinium one of the most recent worlds for the TR to colonize . Even after terraforming Londinium much of was still a harsh desert world . <p> After almost two and a half centuries of colonization the Terran Republic was facing wide spread corruption with in the government and abuses by the " Managers " of the colonization efforts lead to the inevitable on Londinium , rebellion . Fed up with the militaristic abuses by the Mangers and their security forces Londinium 's colonists decided that they 'd had enough and were going to take this planet for them selves . Using their incredibly durable giant humanoid construction mecha know as mobile suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebellion reached it 's climax when the TR Managers decided to abandon the planet and in their hast left several million loyalists on the planet who were forced to flee to the harsh southern continent . Many of the managers fled through the hastily finished jump gate and the gate eventually collapsed cutting of the system from the rest of the TR . <p> After finally gaining their freedom the citizens who were rallied by the quest to free their world now found themselves fighting each other for control based on racial , religious , ideological differences splitting the larger northern continent into many nation states . <p> Almost 100 years later is when the story starts ; following a band of Junkers who go into destroyed cities and bases that litter the central wasteland and search for lost of hard to recreate technology from before the war . The heroes find themselves facing the vanguard of an invasion from the southern continent by the remnants of the Terran Republic Managers who have broken their 100 years of isolation with advanced Mobile Suits of their own and are attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heroes to rally the divided nations and counter the TR invasion under the banner of the advanced TR era mobile suit Gundam . <p> I was watching Vividred while writing this so now I 'm thinking of power-ranger themed units ( 5 of them ) each only slightly stronger than your average grunt and they can combine 2 at a time for better results . <p> And all of them should look like Nobel Gundams with different colors and weapons <p> What I really like to see is LOGH with Gundams , that is a heavy political plot ( not just background ) and high level military tactics , instead of just random skirmishes with a large epic battle in the final episodes . <p> One of the first independent colonies established 140 years ago on a planet 61 light years away , in collaboration with the ELS and a new species discovered along the way , the Valdori , has n't  given signs of life in 3 weeks . With travel between the stars now nearly instantaneous because of the quantization capabilities of crafts and mobile suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lack of communication and transit back and forth is rather suspicious . Innovators , now 94% of the human population , report none of their usual feelings of dread whenever something bad happens , even across the stars . ELS units and Mimics , Innovade/ELS hybrids , volunteer to look it up and do not come back . The fairly small amount of Valdori visitors to the Earth System also claim to ignore what is going on . <p> A note on the Valdori : roughly humanoid , slightly shorter , orange skin , elvish but with a more streamline face . Big black eyes . No special powers , tech not using GN particles , but using unstable mini singularities . High power , short duration , described as a reverse solar furnace , that consumes more power when kept inactive . No MS tech . focused on crafts alone . Innovators touching them can " meld " with them , syncing their feelings . This is only felt by the innovators . <p> A colony class military ship exploring beyond that colony is called back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units ( Grunt MS ) and the ace Pilot , a woman called Skyline Ducati , of italian descent , pilots a Gundam unit , a unique model called Corona Gundam , a gundam designed for interstellar use , with radiation shielding adequate enough to survive a limited amount of time in the corona of a yellow dwarf star and immune to most energy attacks . All use true GN drives , now easily mass produced . <p> They are greeted by a single enemy ( ? ! ? ) unit in orbit : A unit calling itself Eclipse Gundam with Yellow GN Particles , piloted by Harvey Davidson . <p> Twist and turns abound : Both units fight , eventually need to team up and later breakup the alliance when secrets are discovered , allies betray everyone and a mobile armor from the far future gets discovered and yields technologies that will pave the way for the creation of Maelstrom Gundam , a destroyer of Worlds using Darklight GN particles and Galaxy Gundam , a savior for this Galaxy , sporting the Infinity Drive But , are the Valdori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into the sunset ? <p> Features : NO KIDS , an unpredictable alien third party , realistically aged military staff , finally a central female ace pilot as the main protagonist .

@@35099411 @4099411/ <h> Thursday , March 8 , 2012 <h> MG GAT-X102 Duel Gundam Assaultshroud Written Review By TEAM GG <h> The Build <p> The MG Duel Gundam build was a lot of fun . Although there is a lot to this kit , there was n't an overwhelming amount of plates to clean so I was able to get everything cut and cleaned in about five hours or so . The inner-frame of the Mobile Suit was a pretty simple build for the most part but it still has several complex joints in the knees and the waist . You can pose the inner-frame without most of the outer armor on except for the feet and head , which are made up primarily of the light gray and dark blue outer armor . <p> All of the outer armor goes on easily over the inner frame and everything stays together really well . The loosest pieces are on the shoulders , which can sometimes come off when they rub against the chest unit . <p> The Assaultshroud armor pieces are all pretty simple to put together . Most are comprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inner frame pieces with a few orange pieces here and there outlining some thrusters . Most of the Assaultshroud armor does n't  stay together completely until they 're attached to the MS . But once the armor is on the MS , everything is pretty secure , with the most troublesome pieces being the front and back skirts since they are held in place by a couple very small pegs . <h> The Color Scheme <p> The MS has a nice color scheme in my opinion , the major color is a light grey which is offset nicely by the dark grey inner frame and the dark blue pieces on the knees , feet , chest and a few other areas . There are a few orange pieces on the forehead , chest and on the backpack which stands out nicely from the rest . <p> The Assaultshroud armor shares the dark grey of the inner frame and the orange of the accent pieces as well as introducing a light shade of blue for a majority of the armor as well as a few pieces of brown here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , especially with the darker colors below , but its not horrible and it was established in the anime <p> The projectile weapons are made up primarily of the dark grey with a few green stickers for the sensors . The shield has most of the colors on it , so it looks pretty nice . In place of color on the weapons , there is a lot of nice detail molded into the plastic , so painting is always an option.The kit also comes with quite a few decals and stickers to help spruce up the dull areas with some color , but I lack the skill and patience to get them all applied correctly . <h> The Mobile Suit <p> Initially , I was n't all that excited for the MG Duel Gundam , mostly because I did n't  have any attachment to the suit , pilot or design from anime . I did n't  have anything against any of those things , although Yzak was a complete jerk in the show . But Bandai did a good job with the marketing and I really started to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I got the MS all put together , I was really , really impressed with it . The overall design of the MS is really attractive in my opinion . The Duel Gundam of course shares some of the design elements of the Strike Gundam such as the knees and shoulders , but the Duel has several unique elements of its own . The outer shoulders have some sharp angles coming down off the edges , the waist design is unique as well along with the chest and head . The Duel is n't as sleek as the Strike nor is it as bulky as the Buster , rather its a nice mixture of both . <p> The color scheme really came together and looks very nice . The light grey looks great in place of the typical white and the dark grey and blue do a great job offsetting the lighter color . The orange serves as a nice highlight for the chest , head and backpack . <p> All of the important joints ; the knees , ankles , shoulders and torso , are pretty strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MS and the extra armor and weapons pretty well . The shoulders do slouch with the bazooka in hand , but that 's a minor annoyance . You do n't  get the crazy articulation of the MG Red or Blue Frame , but you also do n't  get the hassle of the weak joints or loose armor . <p> The Assaultshroud armor is very nicely designed as well and adds a lot of bulk to the MS , giving it a much tougher look all around , baby blue color aside . There is a lot of nice detail on the Assaultshroud armor , plenty of good lining opportunities . Once you get everything in place , the Assaultshroud armor stays together pretty well . Aside from the front and back skirts , everything else seems to stay on without too much trouble . <h> The Weapons , Equipment and Hands <p> You of course get the standard issue beam saber blades and handles as well as the typical Seed-style shield . In addition , the kit comes also comes with a beam rifle with a grenade launcher , hyper bazooka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite shoulder . The rail gun is mounted on a swivel joint that allows for 360 rotation and a bit of side to side swivel . It can also be held in hand with the flip-down handle . <p> I 've already mentioned the overall lack of color in the weapons as well as the nice amount detail molded into the plastic . The single color setup is pretty typical for a majority of the MG kits out there , but it would be nice to see some additional colors straight out of the box . <p> The hands in this kit are similar to that of the recent MG Wing kits since it comes with two palms and two thumbs as well as four sets of fingers that can be swapped out depending on the circumstance . There are two sets of fingers that are meant to be used to hold on to the projectile weapons . The handles on these three weapons have a large , rectangular port on the outer edge that allows the thicker pegs on the appropriate hands . <p> This setup works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't  work so well for the bazooka . With the first two , the pegs on the hand seem to squeeze in to place and hold there pretty well , but the bazooka handle seems not to pinch the peg at all , so it has to rest on the shoulder while being precariously perched in the hand . It works okay , but there is n't much I can do with it . Maybe something is wrong with my version , but you can get around it . <h> Final Thoughts <p> To put it simply , this is a great kit ! There are very few complaints that I have , and most of those are either cosmetic or minor annoyances that are pretty common on most Master Grades . On the other hand , I cant say enough good things about the kit . It may be silly , but I really appreciate how well everything stays together on this kit . With a lot of MGs , the more fancy the articulation , color separation or impressive the load out is , the more issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , there are n't  too many issues with that sort of thing . <p> The Assaultshroud adds a lot to the kit as well with very little expense to overall quality of this MG . Adding this armor does take a way a little articulation , specifically in the shoulders , but its a minor detraction . I just wish there was a different color used for the outer other than the light blue . The additional armor also adds some nice variation to the kit . If you get tired of the standard MS , you can load it up with the armor and end up with a significantly different looking kit .

@@35099416 @4099416/ <h> MG 1/100 Unicorn Gundam 02 Banshee OVA - Written Reivew by Team GG <p> Just four months after the release of the huge MG Full Armor Unicorn Gundam , the Master Grade Unicorn mold gets another release , this time in the form of MG RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 02 Banshee . The Banshee is the sister unit to the Unicorn Gundam , designed for use in the atmospheric conditions of Earth . The color scheme is nearly the polar opposite of the first suit ; dark blue for the primary color with gold accents as well as a clear orange psychoframe . The V-fin is drastically different , meant to invoke the image of a lions mane as opposed to the horn of a mythical creature . <p> CLICK HERE TO VIEW FULL POST ... In the novel the color scheme , the intended environment of operation and the lack of the La+ system were the primary differences . For the OVA , Bandai decided to change things up even more , which I think was a good decision . The OVA version looses the Beam Magnum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed to either arm as well as a few other minor design differences . <p> On the right arm is the cumbersomely named Armored Arm BS , which is a beam smart gun that is reminiscent of a rail gun . The BS is folded away in Unicorn mode while in Destroy mode it folds out and covers the hand . The left arm has the massive Armored Arm VN , which looks like a giant fist when in Unicorn mode and a menacing claw/pincer device in Destroy mode . The BS is a super long range weapon in the OVA while the VN is a CQC weapon intended to grasp and vibrate the target to pieces . <p> This MG does a good job implementing the new design elements with a minimal amount of new plastic . Some of the inner frame is molded in clear ABS plastic to accommodate the glowing areas that Banshee exhibits in the anime . The legs , backpack and torso are put together , as far as I can tell , in exact same way as original MG Unicorn , aside from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you get to the cockpit hatch area and collar . The Banshee uses a few different pieces here to further differentiate itself from the Unicorn . These pieces are simply decorative and only provide a visual difference . <p> The head is largely the same as before , but with a uniquely designed V-fin . Like the Unicorn , the large section of the V-fin splits in half but there is a smaller section that stays in the same position . In addition , the Banshees " horn " is unique with several sharp points extending off of the main " horn " . This creates a pretty interesting looking V-fin , probably one of the most interesting looking in fact . When transformed , it reminds me of stylized deer antlers or perhaps a branching lightning bolt . <p> You would think the construction of the arms would be dramatically different on the Banshee , but its surprisingly similar . For the most part , you build the arms up like before until you get to the part where you clip on the sides around the Beam Tonfa/Beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you instead combine each half of the respective weapon that you built up in previous steps around that area . There is n't much to the construction of the BS , although the VN does have some interesting steps because of the articulation of each of the claws . <p> So if you were looking for an entirely new build experience , or at least a significantly different process , the Banshee does n't  really satisfy that role . That possible disappointment aside , the overall visual difference is pretty significant . The silhouette has been altered pretty greatly , especially on the upper body , and each of the weapons are completely unique in both design and implementation . I cant think of another kit that I have put together that uses weapons in this way , not in the Gundam universe anyway . <p> I feel that the VN is more satisfying than the BS simply because there is more you can do with it . Each of the four fingers can move independently of the others and they each have a few points of articulation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm at a somewhat odd angle . I think both weapons could use benefit from some additional exposed psychoframe since they are both a little light on it . <p> And if you wanted to , you could use the beam sabers pretty much like before . The hand on the right arm is accessible when the BS is stored away . With the VN transformed , you can fit the beam saber handle in the hand , although the hand cant move around all that much . <p> The color scheme works really well in my opinion . Being a fan of the University of Michigan , the blue and gold color scheme is very appealing to me . I like the clear orange for the psychoframe more than the clear red and as much as the clear green . It lights up pretty nicely under a black light and does a decent job of recreating the glowing effect from the anime . One disappointment is that the V-fin uses a dark blue sticker instead of a piece of plastic on one area . <p> None of the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knees are still limited when it comes to articulation , the transformation is still finicky and time consuming and the kit overall is still pretty limited as far as posing and playability goes . <p> Another nice touch is that because there is so much leftover plastic , you can actually almost achieve a full Banshee ver . Ka out of this , although you 're missing the beam rifle , bazooka and all of the crazy stickers . <p> But I think the Banshee looks really good . I really like the Destroy mode , I think both of the new weapons are a nice departure from the standard beam rifle and shield weapon load-out . The MG Banshee more than a color variation and I think it would be a good time even if you have built the Unicorn a time or two before . So , if you enjoy the Unicorn mold , or if you have n't bought one version or another because the Unicorn is too plain , give the Master Grade RX-0 Unicorn 02 Banshee a try , I think you will have a good time with it !

Most space colonies or orbital elevators seem to be common targets as well as a large asteroid somewhere in the Lagrange Point . But for gods sake , if you ever find yourself inside or near a grunt suit , get as far away as possible . Whether it be a green Zaku II , Astray , or Guntank , they are usually no more than 10 minutes away from being blown to smithereens . And this rule seems to hold especially true for the GM line . I think any enemy friend-or-foe targeting system automatically targets the nearest GM unit and prioritizes as first to be destroyed . So , do yourself a favor and run with all do haste in the opposite direction of any grunt suit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a release in the HGUC line but its predecessor , the GM , has had around 10 different version that has come out in the main line over the years . The GMII is a grunt main-stay in the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam anime series from the 80s , and its physical design follows the limitations set forth by the animators at the time . For animators to quickly , and more importantly cheaply , churn out explosion after explosion involving the grunts , the grunt suits had to have a basic design of mostly simple shapes , very little color variation , and sparse details . So that 's why a lot of the cannon fodder looks so plain . <p> The GMII is of course the successor of the original GM , but has little in the way of improvements . Other than having a 360 degree panoramic cockpit display , all upgrades were minor at best . But it did fill the role as a support mobile suit for a while until more powerful suits were able to be mass produced on a similar scale . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the GMII design eventually leads to the substantially more powerful GMIII . <p> The box lid has a nice illustration of 3 GNIIs guarding the Titans color Gundam Mk II from an unseen enemy . The lid also has the insignia for the Mobile Suite Zeta Gundam anime as well as an " Illustrated by : " line that I do n't  think I 've seen before . I think its good that Bandai is giving credit to the artist/artists that provide the usually pretty great artwork for the lids . And there is the standard complement of product shots and gimmick explanations along the edge of the box . The manual is pretty standard issue , providing the typically well laid-out instructions and several additional product shots and painting/decal guide . <p> Runners &amp; Colors : <p> We get an average amount of plates for the 1400 yen this kit costs . A four color A-plate , a B-plate with only one part for the shield , 2 C-plates , 2 D-plates , a plate of polycaps , two beam saber blades and finally a sticker sheet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gundam would have except for blue .

It follows along similar lines that all the GM based kits seem to have gone down over the years . Its all pretty simple construction for most areas , typically a few large pieces that hold a polycap or two inside with a small amount of actual color separation in the chest unit . The stickers are used sparingly on the major areas ; the only two that are used for non-customization purposes are the two that go around the neck to make it look grey . Other than a couple of stickers for the cameras on various locations , the rest of the stickers are for personalization if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Grunts usually do n't  get issued a lot weapons , because it does n't  really matter what they have since they 're going to blow up as soon as an enemy comes around anyway . Likewise , this kit comes with the typical single beam saber handle with two blades , a simple but heavily channel lined beam rifle , a standard issue shield and a backpack that holds the beam saber handle as well as two , dual nozzle thrusters . There are three manipulators included ; two semi-closed fist hands to hold the beam saber handle and a third trigger-finger handle to hold the rifle . <p> Appearance &amp; Articulation <p> This kit looks good as long as you can accept the overwhelming simplicity of the overall design . Because the kit holds true to the source material , its simple and clean , which is in definite contrast to the recent slew of modern kit designs . Sometimes , its good to revisit the early roots of Gundam history and appreciate where everything comes from . The GMII looks good after a straight build , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look a thousands timesbetter . <p> Along those lines , the articulation of the GMII is a little lacking . The feet have a fair amount of action , but the knees can only bend a little more than 90 degrees . The torso can only swivel side to side a little bit , and there is no ab-crunch or and mid-section movement . The head can turn either way about 45 degrees before it runs into the neck armor . The arms can rotate 360 at the shoulder and beneath the shoulder . The elbows can bend little over 90 and there is a little extra forward movement for the shoulders thanks to the newer jpolycap design . All-in-all , the articulation is neither a strong hindrance nor is it a selling point , but its enough for a kit this price . <p> Conclusion : <p> Is this kit for everyone ? Thanks to the classic design , limited articulation and amount of accessories , probably not at least not if you 're unwilling to look past those limitations .

Actually it worked quite well , the only parts brought over from the AG kit was just the head , shoulder and the booster pack . But I did have to modify the booster and shoulder/arm so that they can be attached to the upper torso . The beam spray rifle will need to be modified as well to become the custom rifle w/ the bayonet that the Genoace Custom uses . And I plan to implement after market parts , do some extra panel lines , minor pla-plates addon , a paint job and decals . I will try to document some of the things that I am going do to this kit . I hope to get all the panel line &amp; pla plates work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 
@@35099443 @4099443/ <p> Imo RG is kinda difficult to assemble due to the extra parts added to place on the frame that plus small parts can break a little too easy or get lost when it pops off the frame , MGs are a bit more detailed and durable due to the stronger plastics used in their frames and exterior parts , true that most HG 144s have a Variety of units that never made it onto 1/100 HGs but that was just unfortunateon another note HG 144s are NOT consistent in their size builds when looking at some different series the unit builds are sodifferent it 's not even funny ( example U.C Dreissen Geara Doga much larger than some 00 or seed series kits same way the 144 Unicorn Destroy mode looks smaller before them , also the Sazabi is just a few inches short from being a 1/100 sized kit ) but are more sturdier than other kits <p> the models are different sized cause the suits are different sized in their shows , a dressen is a big bulky suit , while 00 and seed have slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to exia as the hgs do , and while they do tend to have looser armor , rgs are far more detailed ( on the outside anyway ) than a mg. honestly the only thing better about mgs is the build itself due to the mechanics in the frames , rg has small parts but still fairly straight forward build nothing too complicated , on a side note that pg unicorn is gon na be so much fun ! 
@@35099444 @4099444/ <p> Two Zaku specific manipulators are included to be used with any HG Zaku model kits . The manipulators are rounded just like the typical Zaku type hands .

Various parts on the weapon also have decals applied , which is a nice touch by Bandai . Another plus is that if you purchase 2 System Weapon 001 set , you can attach 2 Gatling Beam Guns together on a 1/144 Unicorn Gundam , which is totally cool .

@@35099447 @4099447/ <p> First the Sandrock comes with lots of markings and he did a pretty good job , neat and tidy . I did not spot any nubs or blemishes either . Overall , a good " straight build " kit . But I think he miss a few panel lines . <p> A nice photo showing not only the proportions of the kit but the work that has been done with it . Care has been taken with this kit and its markings and it shows . Not afraid to show us the kit in its entirety which is a must when it comes to a straight build . <p> A very clean and precise straight build by Henry that answers all of the elements of the competition . Bearing in mind that this competition is firstly about photography , the first thing I look for is a nice shot and that will be the first point of elimination in my judging for those who are interested . The shot is well positioned , well lit , in focus , clear , has a complimentary background colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioning of your kit to enhance the things you have done well and disguise any mistakes is a good idea . <p> As for the Gunpla : I mentioned in the judging panel that the kit you choose to enter is your own choice . Ver . Ka kits typically have loads of markings and if you apply them well this is going to be an advantage as it strongly enhances the look of your straight build . Henry has done so in this instance very well . The markings have been applied cleanly and symmetrically and add much to the aesthetic appeal of the final product . I like subtlety in panel lining and whilst I feel this is underdone I would rather see a few left out than an untidy job . Very few visible gate marks and a good static pose round it out .

Look closely at the boomerang vents , the handle of the Arondite sword , the hydrolic pipes in the ankles and the grey parts of the wings , they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is no need to be confused , as we are enforcing the no paint allow rule ( except for panel linking w/ gundam marker ) . And we do apologize that some of the non-qualify kits made it pass our initial review . But they will be taken out of the competition . <p> Thought we 're being too busy to assess the detail of the participant 's work based on the rules , and we finally lose the spirit of the " straight build " itself . Just my 2 cents , actually lining using gundam marker , pencil , or brush-washing is essentially the same activity ( basically the gundam marker contains the enamel ink ) . As long as there is no paint used to color the parts and no additional decals , IMO it still can be considered as a straight built . But yeah rule is the rule , and the GG Team should 've worked real hard to engage this contest , thank you GG <p> Uuh ... guys ? That Astray Red Frame is a PERFECT GRADE and the finger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to disqualified the participant !

And in case we did n't pass , maybe we still have a chance to send another submission ... there 's no much time left . <p> the crossbone 's scars are painted in .. i believe so cause there are no red finetip gundam marker .. and i 'm not really sure but it looks like it 's flat coated .. i du n no .. team G.G should investigate this i think.just to be fair with everyone .. : ) <p> Hi Guys , Sorry for not being able to catch up with all the comments posted here .

G.G. did n't mention anything about placing them exactly where the manual tells you to .. as long as the decals are included in the kit , everything inside the kit qualifies. : ) <p> @Anon : the decals on my Infinite Justice is from the decal sheet that comes with the kit .. there are spare decals , a lot actually .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't follow exactly where the manual tells me to put the decals on.it 's not against the rules as long as the decals used comes with the kit. : ) <p> oh boy , let 's see here ... the blue frame 's fingers are painted , Michael Angelo Manlapaz 's sandrock has paint on the shortels , Ng Tech Koon 's SF has gold lining on the dragoons , Chessanova 's 00 has decals that never came with it , Thomas Zhuang 's Wing Gundam has clear green paint on the sensor and shield , and Najwan Bin Abdul Rahman 's crossbone gundam has painted red lines on the sides of the head . Might be more , but I 'm not gon na bother looking further <p> Looks like a lot of entries for this category . GG and his boys probably do n't have the time to really look into the fine details . Well anyways , I personally think that a little paint here and there would n't really make a lot of difference . And if we as critical as the anonymous above , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just my 2 cents . Hope to me my entries get posted soon . <p> Damn , lots of really good entries this time ! I especially like Rizky 's Strike , Chen 's Exia , and Hezri 's RX . Sayson 's AGE is a really good one , too . The really shows off the dynamic nature of the kitreally makes me want to pick one up ! Best of luck to all the competitors ! You all deserve to win ! <p> @anon : My Hazel was n't top coated yet , believe me . That 's probably because i used a little light on when taking the picture . But actually it took me a lot of time to sand almost the whole parts of this kit , to make it less shiny . I also gave my best efforts to remove any seam lines and trim the sticker decals . I think I 'm quite happy with the outcome : ) . Rgrds . <p> @kevin goh . Hah , So many Calvin Chen in the world , not suprised , i have a fren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are different people as the quality of their pictures are so different , The Trans-Am Exia is 0.0 whereas the 00 is meh <p> Why does everyone have to keep being so critical and pointing out all the little flaws and things that would n't qualify 's someone model for the contest ? If you 're a submitter yourself , then finding flaws in other people 's submissions just so you have a better chance at winning is downright dishonerable . <p> It 's up to team G.G. in the end , but I personally do n't think a little dab of paint here and there will really make a difference . Or if they used some different decal or touched it up somewhat . It 's not like it 's a completely different model or it 's been customized to become a completely original , stunning kit . <p> This year 's contest does n't really bring " Straight Build " much justice ... There 's no category for model kits that have the stock color and look " straight built " but have been detailed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we have those kits , we can only submit them without painting the shoulders of the HG Strike gray or painting in the HG Heavyarms Custom 's clown mask ? : ( <p> that 's why there 's so many rg here : ) , does n't need too much effort to make those models looks good lol ... maybe in the next contest GG should consider to make sub category of straight built dependence of the kit 's grade , that means more prizes for this contest : p <p> team G.G. made the rules.not us .. it 's only fair to follow them .. what 's the point of having/setting those rules if the contestants wo n't even follow them ? <p> i just think that it would be fair for those who followed the rules to have a better chance of winning than those who did n't .. now that would be very unfair , if the winner did n't even follow the " no paint and waterslide decals " rule .. since it 's the point of having the best " straight built " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Agreed ... and i admire the one who puts his/her best efforts to make his/her model kit looks good even without painting . Yes , we ' re talking ' bout the very basic modelling technique here ; clean cutting part from the sprue , sanding , remove seam-lines , panel-lining , and sticker/decal placement . GL to all participants and many thanks to GG Team . <p> does the realtouch markers qualify as a tool for panel lining ? cause from what i understood , finetip gundam markers are the only markers that are actually made for panel lining , the realtouch markers can be used for painting details , not just panel lining .. if so , those with small colored details used realtouch markers and not finetip gundam markers cause i believe there are only three colors for the finetip markers , black , gray and brown .. <p> Citrus @ 1-jan 11.36 PM ; thank you for the compliment . i personally admire the picture of Nguy SF. the lighting , hi quality camera and the pose itself . there 's a lot of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . cheers , good luck &amp; have fun . <p> In my opinion , the picture quality indeed is taken into consideration , but the main point of assessment is the model kit itself . The final work reflects the efforts of the modeller ( ranging from cutting parts , sanding , seamlines removing , panel lining , and decal placement ) , and yeah of course it could only be proven through a decent picture quality : ) . <p> yeah .. all those efforts only can be proven in a decent quality pictures . <p> Anonymous @ January 5 , 2012 1:23 AM ; <p> - coolest poses or the prettiest pictures DOES have advantages . especially who can build the kit nicely. - we never know what kind of pictures the contestant was submit for pic extra1 and extra2. the only displayed here only the main picture . So , definitely contestant will show other angles of their model , to show judges the quality of their own straight-build skill . IMO only . cheers .. <p> Hmm , just noticed something , the Crossbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cause I have this crossbone ver ka too , and it really looks different , from the texture , color , it looks flatcoated or topcoated , plus look at the ends of core fighters , the yellow bits near the booster , it does n't look like stickers , but looks painted , I might be wrong but , can you double check it , cause it will be unfair for all of those who entered the contest . Thanks <p> Next year there should be some consideration into separating by grade . Straight Build is for beginners but the first round elimination guys are all Master Grades , Real Grades and even a perfect grade . Aside from SD Unicorn , it looks to me like beginners might as well not even enter . <p> nope , its not top coated.this picture might not clearly shows it because of the lightning and the cape did n't  help neither.still the other extra pics i sent have the whole body shown without he cape and he still have its plastic shininess.heck , i can still show it if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture. =Pbtw good luck to the others.may the best wins . <p> i 'm a bit confused , cause there are seven pictures there but underneath it , it only says four names from the seven pictures .. does that mean the bottom three are already eliminated ? please answer team G.G .. : D <p> Yes the PG Strike Gundam by Ching Ken Huo is on a Photoshop Website from 2010 I cant see the other pictures he Sent of the Kit But you should get More Info on it . its looking to me like he found it online and just sent it in thanks for Looking in to it G.G <p> Somewhat disappointing .. I see that the judges selected based only on pure straight built kit ( no lining , adjusting &amp; trimming decal , or fixing seam lines ) , which means ignoring the efforts of the other participants who have worked hard and spent lots of time to do those things . Btw congratulations to the participants who have passed the preliminary round . Good luck : ) . <p> so in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , because it has decals and clear stickers , is n't it ? I think it 's unfair for those who had post pictures of their HG because it does n't come with decals although the pictures are taken well .. Gundam Guy , the next time that you 'll make a straight build competition I think you should divide them into different categories , like straight build HG , straight build MG or straight build PG . that 's all ...

@@35099455 @4099455/ <p> Extreme Vs . Full Boost retains the trademark gameplay of previous installments of the Gundam Vs. series , with a few adjustments and changes . During a standard arcade battle , each team is given a resource meter of 6000 points ; when a mobile suit is shot down , its cost is deducted from the meter , and the first team to hit 0 loses . Each mobile suit costs 3000 , 2500 , 2000 , or 1000 points , with higher cost machines being more powerful while cheaper machines are much weaker . A few missions , particularly boss battles , eschew this in favor of making a single machine the target and having its defeat be the goal of the stage ( the player 's side still has a resource meter and will lose as normal if it 's depleted ) . <p> Gamplay makes use of four primary buttons : Shoot , Melee , Jump , and Search . There are also three sub-commands used by pressing Shoot and Melee ( Sub-Weapon ) , Shoot and Jump ( Special Shooting ) and Melee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machines can have two different charge attacks , activated by holding the Shoot or Melee button until a meter on the ammunition display fills . <p> Extreme Vs. adds in two important gameplay changes . Extreme Action is the ability to dash-cancel one 's attacks , allowing the player to string together larger and more damaging combos . Extreme Burst is a super mode , similar to older games ' Awakenings , activated by pressing Shoot , Melee , and Jump together when a meter at the bottom of the screen is filled . Several machines ( primarily those piloted by the protagonists of each series ) also have a super-powerful Burst Attack , executed by pressing Shoot , Melee , and Jump together while Extreme Burst is active . Full Boost will give Burst Attacks to every mobile suit in the game as well as spliting Extreme Burst into 2 two types , Assault Burst and Blast Burst . <p> True but the Ps4 could run this flawlessly and expansions on next gen consoles are normal ( Look at Dynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends coming to Ps4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only help not hurt Dogfight Replay and Gundam Extreme Versus footage is really popular across the internet and the Ps4 would only help that with it 's built in recording abilities . <p> The PS4 is n't even out . Why bet on a dog that is n't even running when the PS3 is all over in Japan , guaranteeing sales already ? I mean , any future titles will likely have a PS4 version too but right now that 's pointless . <p> Someone on another board mentioned that the PS4 can play digital PS3 titles ? I do not own nor intend to own a PS4 so I can not confirm this , but if it is true that the PS4 can play digital PS3 games , then you PS4 owners can play Full Boost . The Famitsu article specifically lists Full Boost as having a digital release for both the regular and Premium G Sound versions . <p> However , everyone saying that it should have been a PS4 native game is hilarious . It was developed on System 357 ( a PS3 mainboard , lol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by when they accidentally advertised Xi for Full Boost ... using a video of Xi running in PS3 EXVS . Whoops ! ) . It was never going to be a PS4 or PS Vita game . It was always going to be a PS3 game . That 's all there is to it . <p> Neither the S , Ex-S , nor anything else from Sentinel has ever been confirmed for this game . The leaked list was Crossbone X-3 , Gaia , Gold Frame Amatsu , Kapool , Arios , Gerbera Tetra , Rozen Zulu ( all of which are in now ) and G-Fighter , AGE-1 , and Striker Custom ( which have yet to be added . <p> With Shin Gundam Musou ( i.e. Dynasty Warriors Gundam 4 ) on the horizon , and likely to get a US release ( probably just Japanese voices with the text all in English ) , I think this would be a perfect chance to give ' Westerners " the chances to play Gundam Xtreme Vs. with the Full Boost version ... <p> just play the damn game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- <p> EXVS already was made with majority of its menu text in English , plus everything in the game is pretty straightforward . Even the missions . It ai n't like Musou games where some important dialogues are being made anyway ... I ca n't read Japanese characters except for those that constitute the word Gundam , but I was able to get through everything just because the game ai n't that complicated to navigate through . <p> That 's probably a fat chance considering the game is mainly geared toward a Japanese audience . There 's no English fanbase for the game to begin with , and typical fans probably do n't even know of the game . <p> They bring DW Gundam over here since DW has somewhat of an audience in America . <p> So you 're saying that because Gundam is " geared toward a Japanese audience " that Namco-Bandai ( or whoever is making this ) would n't want to allow a publisher to localize the game ? oo <p> Also , if that was true , then why do we even have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that " DW has somewhat of an audience in America ... " is n't a good reason since we 're talking about Gundam. &gt;&gt; <p> Umm , actually it 's a pretty good reason from their point of view . I 'd venture to guess there 's a bigger player base for DW games than there is for Gundam in the US in this day and age . DW : Gundam sells because it has the Dynasty Warriors name on it , and then people who like Gundam are all the happier . From a business standpoint , they know a DW : Gundam game will sell , porting over something like EXVS , is a bit more of a risk . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I would love for EXVS to come to the US , but considering we have n't gotten a game from the Vs. series since I believe 2004 , it 's very unlikely . <p> I really do n't see what the big deal is in importing quite honestly , especially when the hardware is region free . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just menus besides the instruction booklet . <p> If wishful thinkers are too cheap about making a purchase , you can wait a year for the reprinted version while there 's still no " localized " version . <p> You honestly think that a review by G4TV is why the VS series stopped showing up ? Seriously ? See , if it were an issue of some entity holding the copyrights and being dicks about it ( SEE : Harmony Gold and Macross games ) then that 's one thing . But a random review saying that it 's generic and for Gundam fans only ? Come on , now . You ca n't possibly be that na+ve . <p> Besides , the VS series was n't the only Gundam game franchise to not show up . There have been plenty of other great Gundam games which did n't come over , the reason possibly being similar to why the VS series stopped . <p> Well there is also the whole fact of licensing considering that that much of the content in game is of series that never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super robot games make it to the US . There is also the fact that Gundam is n't as popular here , so it would likely be a financial loss for it to be released here . Believe me I would be ecstatic for it to get a western release , but Gundam is n't Final Fantasy level popular here , which is a shame . <p> I wonder how this will play out . From what I understand , Arcade Full Boost did n't have some units that the PS3 DLC had for the original Extreme Vs . News is yet to be confirmed if all the DLC will be included in this game , or if old DLC could work with the new game if they are not included . <p> Greetings everyone , I 'm from Venezuela and I made my mind and decided to start building gunpla , right now I 'm traveling through USA , a tri-state course between California , Nevada , Utah and the way back ; so I would like to know where can I buy model kits , I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back through Las Vegas and finishing in Los Angeles , so I 'll be really interested if someone could kindly give me info about places where I can buy the model kits in those places , thank you very much for any kind of recommendation <p> Ying Hobby in san Francisco Chinatown my friend , GGINFINITE is online shop also shop from gundam guy , hlj.com import straight from japan warehouse to any country , 1999. co onlinehobby web store also have Gundam , hobbywave.com is in U.S it have gundam and also cheap paint . <p> ( Playstation 3 ) Gundam Extreme Vs .

Custom BGMs have been in since EXVS so we assume that feature will be included but no source thusfar has confirmed it . So yeah , that 's pretty much it until TGS on the 21st . <p> I 'm sure there will be some sort of Trial Mission mode . Bamco would n't waste the opportunity to not include something they had in their predecessor Extreme VS , plus the business model of having more Mission DLC to purchase is too much for Bamco to pass up . <p> We do not know yet . The translation I provided above is all the information we have right now . Please wait until the 21st for TGS to know more about this game . Do not panic just because some MS or BGM or mode is n't listed right now . We just plain do n't know very much about this game right now . <p> If I am correct the 90 playable units is the roster that is on arcade edition right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PS3 edition , anyone care to guess what they might be ? Banshee Norn , the mysterious new mobile armor of Full Frontal for episode 7 , Nightingale , AGE-FX , Dark Hound , Glansa , all the base AGE units ( 1-3 ) , Ex-S Gundam , Phantom Gundam , X-0 Gundam are just a few I am thinking of . Maybe Advance of Zeta may get some units in game too if Bamco 's trend of including mobile suits from side stories holds up ( look at Xi and Blue Destiny ) . <p> I 'm actually hoping some of the MS that got the boot from GVGN+ going to ExVS to return like Akatsuki , Epyon , Kampfer and Guncannon to name a few . And as much as I 'd want another Tieria unit , I ca n't say the same for Virtue/Nadleeh since 00 already has a freakin ' 9 unit roster , 11 if you count 00 QanT and Raphael to the list . <p> Wish they 'd add Fon Spark too seeing as he was in the last SD Gundam PSP game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It specifically says ' over 90 units ' including ' over 20 that were not present in EXVS PS3 ' . This of course does refer to the suits we already know are in the arcade version of EXVSFB ( Striker Custom from KATANA and G-Bull from 0079 have n't been unlocked yet but we already know they 're in ) . The ' over ' just let 's them put whatever they want into the game . I 'm sure they 'll want to break the 100-suit barrier with this title since it 's so close . Whether they 'll do it on launch or not is up in the air , but chances are there will be DLC to break into triple-digits . <p> As for what will actually be added ... who knows . Speaking purely my own personal opinions here so please do not take offense or think I have any official standing ( I do n't , I can only translate Japanese ) , I do n't think Banshee Norn is a possibility . While it 's true that Crossbone has a roster of lookalikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be VERY difficult for them to justify having Puru/Banshee at the same time as Riddhe/Banshee Norn . <p> Wish list ? I hope Epyon does get back into the game just so Wing Zero TV wo n't be alone . If a Fon Spaak unit gets in that 's brilliant , because then you can have four-way Okamoto-san . I also hold out hope that Sentinel will get S/ExS and MkV . I freaking love Sentinel with a passion , so when I saw the ' ALICE ' skill from the previous leak my heart leapt . A 1/144 S-Gundam was the very first Gundam kit I ever had , and is the oldest kit in my collection . Please , Bamco ! Do n't let me down ! Give Sentinel some love ! ! <p> I also totally would n't mind Harute getting added . My buddy 's a huge Al/Hal MS fan , and doing something like ' while Marute is active all normal attacks are automatically multi-lock ' would be super cool and something never done before in the history of the VS series . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main difference between Full Boost(Vanilla) &amp; Premium G release was the special BGM included . thankfully I cancelled my order on EXVS since there is a sequel(FB). except I do n't play my PS3 Slim not much these days , rarely play . the only thing is learning this game mechanics &amp; that rainbow steps . <p> Yes , the only difference between the regular edition and the Premium G Sound Edition is the expanded soundtrack . If the additional songs are n't necessary for you ( or you only care about custom soundtrack while playing offline ) then the regular edition will do you just fine . <p> For reference , here is the complete tracklist for the regular edition ( since it 's the same as the arcade game ) : <p> GG , do you people just not read your own comments section ? You ' updated ' this post but it 's still completely WRONG ! You are spreading FALSE INFORMATION to the English-speaking Gundam community about this game ! Please correct your information : <p> Oh , and also , we 've known for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arcade version of EXVSFB , so that 's another series featured . There was a skill with the image ' ALICE ' in the same leak , so it 's -possible- that Sentinel will be lucky #30 . <p> Just putting that out there . Come on , GundamGuy , do some research and get some people who can actually understand Japanese to do your informational posts for you . Or at least have a QC/fact-check team do a once-over on it first ! <p> I 'm still mad about the whole Striker Custom thing .

Wing Zero and Epyon ... Rivals ... 00 and Reborns ... Rivals ... Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice ? BS get that out of there ...

Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na play EXVSFB with my Japanese Friends without the problems from US to Japan . Does anyone know whether I can play or not here ? <p> Hey guys ...

If you were a true mobile suit fan you know there are full armor versions for every gundam there are . <p> this did n't  fight against Neo Zeon though , just regular Zeon . and the reason for all the extra armor and it having 4 shields is that it fought in the debris zone " Thunderbolt Sector " so it needed protection from the debris <p> wait , it Is MG Form , With 7000 Yen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color looks like Dynasty Warrior Gundam Style , I mean , it looks diferent. : v waiting to see final Product , and decal Put On .

Waiting to see next announcement , How do you think ? <p> I 'll probably get this version given that they use a new mold/the RX-78-2 3.0 frame and not some obsolete design with some new parts . It 's happened too many times which really compromise the solidity of a figure . Really loving how this looks but will have to wait and see if it will really be worth it . <p> This is definitely a completely new mold from what I can tell . It looks to have detachable armour which is an awesome touch but I foresee some horrible stability issues like the MG Unicorn where he wo n't be able to hold up his weapons in many poses , but he has a load of gimmicks on him which is really compelling .

My goal with this series has been to rewatch Gundam SEED for the first time since it originally aired back in 2002 . Its a rewatch with open arms and an open mind after almost a decade of seemingly universal SEED hatred within the North American Gundam community . <p> So far my experience has been mostly positive . There are some rough parts , not really with the characters , but the weak plot and setting . Certainly nothing to justify the vehement hate . <p> If this is your first time seeing a Revisiting Gundam SEED article please check out Part 1 @ LONG ... <p> Looking Back at Part 1 <p> Before getting to my comments on the second quarter of Gundam SEED I wanted to take a few moments to address the first part of my review , or rather , some of the comments that it garnered . . <p> Newtypes v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up at some point , though I was waiting for the end of the series to see how things fleshed out . I agree , its nice to see both sides of the racial divide but I cant really credit SEED for handling that too well . From what Ive seen both sides are a bunch of children and the radical Blue Cosmos group has n't  done much more than spill some condiments and get mentioned in passing . I prefer the slower development of a Newtype , and the mystery surrounding it , instead of the plausible yet boring coordinator origins . <p> Zeta Gundam has flaws ? Well , yes , its not perfect but one can blame its issues on 80s anime trends . SEED only has itself to blame . <p> To the person who commenting on the rapid development of mobile suit tech in the series , you 're absolutely right . I had n't  realized it until you pointed it out . While the franchises non-UC era shows had been slowly leaving its " realistic " roots behind , SEED really took it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much start out with overly impressive mobile suits which can only ( and do ) develop into brighter and flashier models way too quickly . <p> One or two commenters mentioned that the HD remake I was watching was only one phase of Sunrises remake . It seems I was checking out the version which aired on TV initially and Sunrise later released a full remake with updated animation all over the place . As one source dried up I moved to a second and now , I think , I 'm watching the final release . Frankly , I cant tell whether the fully re-done animation looks better or worse . Sure , its cleaner and nicer looking , but the style change is just does n't  look right ... <p> Did the change they soundtrack too ? Episode 25 or 26 opened with some god-awful porno music . Apparently there 's some recons in here too , something about Nicol swinging first and Kira coming down with space herpes from Flay ? I barely remember the series as it originally was , let alone if there 's a sudden surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up several times which makes sense as it was the first non-CE animated program to take to the airwaves after Gundam SEED Destiny . Let 's be real , Gundam 00 had some issues , especially in the second season . It lost all the tactical love , added superfluous hax , and drowned us in some of the worst relationships to grace the franchise . It was faaaaar from a fantastic improvement ( well , maybe not to Destiny ) . Am I going to have to review that too ? <p> Anyhow , back to SEED ... <p> Part 2 : Episodes 14-26 <p> The second quarter of Gundam SEED was fairly mundane and boring . I would n't go as far as to say it was bad , just boring , as I felt the entire desert arc was primarily a setup period . Lots of important things were set up though , from the introduction of Calgilli , the death of the Desert Tiger , and Frays decline into a full blown crazy bitch . <p> I was looking forward to seeing Andrew Watfels character , the Ramba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed . For starters , Andrew is a rather one dimensional character . He s almost too good of a person . He s likable , seems to treat people fairly , and otherwise does n't  show much in the way of negative traits . This becomes an issue when you set a character like this up against the desert rebels , another likable organization . When neither side shows any real negative qualities one realizes immediately how stupid this war is and begins lose interest in their battles once you see through the stupidity of it . Now , I get that Gundam is built around otherwise avoidable wars where each side has redeeming qualities . Yet when you remove adverse qualities viewers arrive at the " war is bad " conclusion too soon and too cleanly . This seems to be a big issue with SEED . Two sides are fighting , with very little in the way of asshole villains or acceptable cause for violence . <p> The Japanese must have very small coffee cups <p> A larger issue with Andrew Watfels character comes with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too mundane . Kira meets Watfiel , very quickly realizes that he s not a douche , and moves on . There 's no proceeding confrontation between the two or epic mid-battle argument about the reasons they fight . This lack of depth , lack of emotional oomph , comes into play after Watfiels death and Kiras remembrances of their two encounters . Its supposed to mean something to Kira , shape who he is , but as a viewer it just fell flat . Its hard to appreciate Kiras thoughts when he s flashing back to an empty motivator . <p> Also , what was with his random two episode chick that looked suspiciously like Roux Louka ? Talk about a throw-away . <p> While the desert arc spent a lot of time developing Andrew as an influence to Kira , a lot was done with the newest female member , Cagalli Yula Athha . <p> Cagilli was bound to return after her brief appearance in the first episode , and its a welcome shift . Shes surprisingly down to earth , is able to take on a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . That is to say that she 's well balanced with little issues like hot-headedness and overconfidence , none of which really get in the way of the story or come off as annoying . The more I think about it the more I realize her positive impact on the series . With anyone else , that random meeting with Athrun on the uninhabited island would have been outright awful . Her presence also serves as an important counterbalance to other key female characters such as the vapid Lacus or psycho Flay . <p> Flay , oh how everyone loves to hate her , and its easy to see why . With each episode in the second quarter of SEED she becomes an amazing caricature of an awful , need , manipulative woman . Shes the only person on the entire ship who does jack shit . Instead she goes full teenage drama on everyone . Though , and I know I 'm going to get a lot of hate for this , in the end it works . Its interesting to see Kira pushed away from his friends by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of subtlety which I appreciate . Either way I 'm more annoyed at fans who think that she 's worthy of respect or think she has any redeeming characteristics . <p> How we all feel about Flay <p> Ship ? What ship ? <p> Most frustrating element of these past episodes is the amount of filler ( for lack of a better word ) . Right after were done going through an extensive setting up phase with the desert arc we get the sea arc which is a thousand times worse . The enemy commander is just awful at what he does and is in no way interesting or memorable . Time is wasted on Strike trying to fight in the ocean while were treated with reused animation and some of the worst water CGI Ive ever seen . Again , its all setup filler , this time for the Cagilli/Athrun island episode . <p> To make things worse the underwater suits used by ZAFT have to be some of the ugliest god damn things I 've ever seen . They 're just terrible . Zero redeeming features . They cant even effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same awful designer is the one to give them their awful names . ZnO and GOOhN ? What the shit . <p> ( <p> BuCUEs are just as terrible . I remember , when SEED first aired , how excited I was for them . Maybe it was just the current Zoids fandom driving appreciation for four-legged mechs but seeing them in action finally was devastatingly disappointing . They 're poorly animated ( terrible CGI with moments shifting to painfully contrasting &amp; lazy-as-fuck cel animation ) and completely ineffectual . Somehow they have no problem firing rockets accurately into caves but have a hard time hitting a stationary Strike . <p> The only decent ZAFT designed suit was this cannon fodder . <p> Just when you think these designs cant get any worse they get ... better ? Well , for a moment at least , with the the awesome Astray . I must have ditched Gundam SEED prior to this point before because I do not recall seeing them on screen years ago . Their design , while not as refined as the MG Blue or Red Frames , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a nice shot of the head , where the animation is just superb . If only SEED looked this awesome all the time . <p> All of this takes place in the Land of Orb , or whatever Orbs country is called . Its basically Anaheim Electronics on steroids . This development was easily the best part of Q2 . After a completely unexpected battle against the other X units , out of nowhere comes this country . It was barely mentioned throughout the series and now it seems setup to be a big player . I 'm really hoping this turns into Zaft v. Earth Federation v. Orb . It would be a welcome change to the formula ( by using the Zeta formula ) and might actually produce some interesting developments . <p> Best two characters in the whole series <p> Speaking of interesting developments there are a couple things dropped here and there that will probably come into play greatly later , namely Kira being a " berserker " and that he has a brother ( probably Athrun ) . The berserker thing I get but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do like how they explained the history of coordinators and that of George Glenn , though its pretty much impossible he did all the stuff they said he did . Pilot , college graduate at the age of 17 , somehow got into professional football out of MIT and even got an a olympic medal ( in football I guess ? ) . Itll have been a massively wasted opportunity if one of his descendants left behind at Jupiter does n't  come back and Scirocco everyone . <p> Coordinators can do everything . Except shoot down this wildly undefended ship . <p> There were some weird references in these past few episodes , such as Glenns ship the Tsiolkovsky being the same as Sciroccos Jupiteris from Zeta Gundam . Or Lacus drawing a Turn-A mustache one one of her Haros . Its all very contrived . A bit of , " nudge nudge look what we threw in . Recognize it do n't  ya ? " <p> Despite my complaints I 'm somewhat eager to see what happens next following the introduction or Orb and its mobile suits . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of each quarter and tie them together with some solid developments . The Freedom Gundam and another set of four antagonists have made an appearance in the new opening so its apparent that the mid-series change up is fast approaching . I 'm quite skeptical though . So far no one they 've introduced has been able to really be a compelling counter to Kira and their suits , as best I can tell , are ugly as shit . <p> Round 2 and Falldog still does n't  hate SEED ? ! <p> P.S. - Its worth noting that Sunrise removed the clip shows from the remaster . As such my episode count used for these reviews reflects the 48 or so episodes still remaining post-update . <p> Oh f*** not you again ! Can you possibly write one sentence without referring to other peoples sexual preferences ? If you do n't like Seed just say : " I do n't like Seed " and explain why in a respectful , non-condescending manner . <p> Do you have to wear a hat that say " asshole " everywhere you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear skintight spandex shorts and a tank top and still carry a concealed pistol around " Yuy was n't yaoi/fangirl bait ? Or how about the absurdly pretty and effeminate Quatre ? Then there 's Duo , who 's basically Quatre with fabulous braided brown hair and less effeminate in demeanor . Trowa has little personality to speak of and Wufei 's a douche , but they 're still prettyboys too.Do n't get me wrong , I love Wing . But let 's face it , the whole " gaggle of pretty boys in Gundams " is by no means new to Seed . <p> Amuro is a bishounen ( at the time ) Char is ikkemenKamile is a pretty boy with girl 's nameJudau is a pretty boy ( and a crossdresser ) Amuro and Char CCA are both ikkemenUsso is a shotaLoran is the prettiest gundam pilot disguised as female with nude fanservice all over the first 2 episode . With fabulous long legged mech with butterfly wings . <p> Amuro x Char fangirls are the one who kept original Gundam aired before it 's popular ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like super robots back then ) <p> I do n't understand how you say Zeta being driven by 80s anime trends somehow exempts it from criticism when EVERY ANIME is driven by trends of the day . Seed was obviously driven by the need to appeal to women which is why they dialed up the soap opera aspects to extreme levels . Judging by the show 's sales I 'd say it succeeded . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not a Seed fan . I just do n't think nostalgia for the past should be a valid reason to criticise something which was made with modern tastes in mind . <p> Where did I say Zeta was exempt from criticism ? I said that it 's flaws can be directly attributed to the era in which it was created . SEED was n't done during an era when terribly teenage drama was forced into shows or it was hip to appeal to girls . <p> Back on topic , Seed followed a lot of modern anime tropes . We have a much greater focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait for pretty much every named character . Not that that any of this automatically makes the show bad mind you , but at times even I felt like the story lagged bit . Luckily the second half picks up the pace and was more entertaining to watch . <p> While things could change between now and finishing the series one of the things I had intended to get into for the final review is how Gundam SEED recycled tropes and themes from a number of Gundam series ' before it . That 's not a bad thing . It 's just at this point SEED has n't really expanded on them or used them to their full potential . There are a bunch of strong plays that just fell flat . <p> I have n't had to opportunity to live in Japan so do n't know what the culture likes or dislikes but it 's clear to me that Seed obviously hit upon something that appealed to a new generation of teens as well as creating one of largest female Gundam fanbases . <p> Haha yeah , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the west Gundam is still a Japanese product made to appeal to Japanese people so as someone outside looking in there 's a lot I do n't get about why certain things are popular . <p> Regarding Gundam , it seems like every show since Seed has been trying replicate its success in one way or another which is why we see a lot of elements bleeding into later shows like 00 , Age and even Unicorn in some ways . Age , from what I remember in a early interview , was specifically designed to " recapture " Seed 's success lol . <p> Did you forget how many designs came out of the One-Year War alone ? And how long was that ? Also , why is this series of articles HERE , on a news site ? This sort of stuff should remain a personal blog , where I can safely ignore it , instead of having shoved it my face when I 'm looking for NEWSnot opinions . <p> This is not a news site . Its a blog . Were you ever here before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blog ? This place used to go a few days without a single new post and sometimes he 'd be posting his own models that he was building . <p> I ca n't really agree with Falldog 's opinions on MS development either . UC is just as guilty of this as any Gundam show . I honestly thought Seed was fairly reserved in this respect ( Destiny got ridiculous though ) . <p> You must have really poor self control when stopping to read something equates to it being " shoved in your face . " <p> To the point though , yes , 0079 did have a lot of monster-of-the-week type mecha thrown in from Zeon but they were generally first generation prototype suits that failed . But it 's not about the plethora of designs but the technical level of each . For the most part Zeon was working with second generation equipment that was relatively realistic and was n't such a massive departure in terms of technology . As UC goes on there 's the comparatively slow development from one generation to the next while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any stretch but it 's certainly better handled . Tech in SEED is an exercise in leap frogging . <p> Taken on its own the tech progression in 0079 is fine , but with every new OYW sidestory it seems like every joe schmoe feddie or zeon had some kind of secret advanced uberweapon that breaks continuity . <p> IMO , it can be explained in universe . After all , we have genetically enhanced geniuses running around for all 3 sides at some point , not to mention spies leaking information about breakthroughs or simply stealing them . Given that education will evolve with the skills and talents of students as well as the era itself , I think we can expect that even Naturals had advanced knowhow related to sciences and engineering . <p> You can think of it as ZAFT working on N-Jammer Cancellers while trying to improve their MS on the side . ORB and OMNI were working on MS development full time . After they 're successful , they exchange info making even more revolutionary upgrades or the re-introduction of certain weapons . <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed , restricting development of the typically nuclear powered suits . The later events of seed allow suits to have nuclear power and that 's why we see a rapid development in the kind of weapons mobile suits can have available to them . <p> In my mind seed seems to have developed the tech required before the series starts , but these are render useless and only come in for suits that can support them . Thus why freedom have multiple beam cannons , while aile strike has two measly beam sabers . <p> BTW , I like all gundam series but seed is n't on the top my personal list . <p> I do n't remember much of the previous blog but this one 's still pretty good . You really hit the mark with the boring characterizations . Aside from some of the complaints mentioned here , one of the things I really disliked about SEED was the repetitive battle scenes . Its almost as if they cut and pasted the scenes because they did n't know how to progress a battle . Other Gundam shows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " newer " release . You 're also right about how the coordinators have these amazing skill yet ca n't destroy a single ship . Do n't take too long for the next review . <p> The coordinator concept was pretty interesting at first but ended up as nothing but window dressing . Despite numerous mentions throughout the show about how supposedly superior they are , they suck just as much as any other natural grunt compared to Kira . <p> But my biggest complaint with the show they never explain what the hell the SEED is ! In most other shows like X , 00 and even Age , the newtype concept is a relevant part of the story but Seed ( and Destiny ) seems to have forgotten about this crucial plot point . It pretty much ends up being a 1UP mushroom for Kira and co . <p> You did n't watch the recap episode in the original anime did n't you ? They explained it briefly but they explained it as something that they had almost no knowledge of it , kind of like how Psycho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it is but he ai n't talking . The point still stands though . It never develops into anything significant in the story and is at best a power up mushroom to get the heros out of sticky situations . <p> I love the seed and destiny even more I do n't  know why all the hateit has its terrible moments yes but why all the hate seed was nice it was the first non dubbed gundam I saw , and was the first gundam I saw from start to finish , so i was a nice experience for me . while destiny was frucking touching with story and oh my god , her death made me cry like a little bitch and Shinn back story was good my only complaints that they switched the focus so fast to the original hero again but it was nice to see both sides of the coin . and the destiny gundam MS is within my top 3 gundams that all is shared with love ( exia and 00qT ) <p> I think every Gundam series , well ever series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing as " The perfect Show " . Partially because everyone has different tastes . I like Gundam 00 , various UC Gundam Series and other Anime because they relate to how I think in certain terms . THat is not to say that there are not things about each that I dislike . As much as I like 00 there are certain things you must over look in order to rationlize the whole situation . Sometimes if you start to really question one aspect of this , the whole thing falls apart . Personal opinion is that a show requires you to have enough things that you do like to over ride the things you do n't  . For me Seed and Destiny both were to full of problems with story , ms design , and mostly a lack of characters that did n't  make me wish I was Hellen Keller so I would n't have to listen . P.S. I realize this is the internet and as long as there is a way to voice their opinions people will do it . But I will quote Mark Twain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay silent and let people think your a fool , than to open your mouth and remove all dobut . " <p> this is stupidwhy would anyone want to waste their time even reviewing anything seed ? <p> it has n't  aged well and its always going suck . you should really get used to it . it seems like anyone that says anything about another series and comparing those in its defense is just in denial over it . you 're all a bunch of faggots if you like it and have a shit taste . that is all <p> Regarding the point about Nicol swinging first , it seems you 're not there yet Falldog lol . Suffice to say it makes Kira look more holy and innocent while the other guy look like a complete idiot for running face first into a ... I 've said too much ! <p> To be honest , in that situation , it is still an accident.What they both did is kind of right at the time . Nicole dashing into Kira because he wants to protect Athrun without knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Anti-Sword pointing at Athrun ) Kira , seeing Nicole as an enemy , dashing into him with a spear , of course would protect himself from that . At this point anyone could say that Kira could just move way , but the thing is , in his position ( with the sword overhead ) it 's hard to move the way that people wants it because they have no concept of a sword . What Kira did is the correctly way to get out from that position.To slowly lower it down to whatever side that 's its at ( right side in this case ) <p> In the original Kira is clearly shown " swinging " the sword in self-defense . But in the remastered version they make it look Kira is in complete control and is actively trying to " back away " from Nicol making him look like a blind idiot who runs right into what 's in front of him . <p> Yes , you could argue they were both an accident but the original felt sincere while the remaster is truly Lucas-worthy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mu 's helmet floating in space . <p> Never thought I 'd say this but suiton is a saint compared to this guy . He contributes nothing to the discussion and is only here bitch and whine about how much he hates Seed . We get it , now move on before you embarrass yourself further . <p> My dear boy , its only " some " , not all . people like you dig UC , I 'm fine with it , in fact i love UC with its terrific designs such as the nu gundam and the Ex-S. but the constant bashing of seed is unwanted , even if it had its severe flaws . remember , bandai , like any sensible company , will do anything to make money , and since it had been proven that seed is a money printer for them second to only UC , they will do it . plus , bandai will only take consideration for the home consumers in japan , and since seed is popular there , its the logical choice . <p> grow up and take a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to sense <p> give all of us the respect we deserve for liking anything gundam , whether seed or not . its what this hobby really need right now . <p> as of now , your argument is invalid , SeedSucksit , until you change yourself for the good . <p> so much arguments ........ ca n't we all just ignore the comments we do n't like ...... ? so what if someone hates seed / 00 / uc whatever ....... just ignore them .... like what you like , ignore others who do n't agree with you , no need to argue . easy . <p> Everybody has their own personality .. so its their taste . You ca n't force your taste into someone else . It is a type like you who made this world full of conflict . Realize that not everyone like you . Respect another , we have the same common in one brotherhood , a GUNDAM itself . No need to fight each other <p> I do n't want spoil anything so I wont . But I do love me some SEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worked up even . The factions are all terribly interesting to me , and the coordinators vs naturals while ' newtyps ' takes a backseat was not only welcome imb but I think helps to make SEED it 's own entity and not just a parallel to the UC . <p> The SEED thing ( berserker ) gets mentioned a few times even up through Destiny . while staying quite vague I think it was something that was supposed to be further uncovred as the series progressed . With these HD remasters it probable we 'll get something in the future , whether it be the mia movie or even more .

@@35099469 @4099469/ <h> Monday , January 23 , 2012 <h> Mega Size 1/48 Gundam AGE-1 Normal - Review by Team GG <p> Bandai 's 1/48 Mega Size line of kits are impressive in stature though simplistic in design . A few inches taller than a Perfect Grade equivalent the model 's complexity is closer to a High Grade kit on growth extract . As such for what you gain in size and grandeur you lose in articulation and internal details . <p> Those unfamiliar with the model line might find the construction process a little bit confusion . There 's a lot more Japanese dialog in the instructions than most kits , of which I have no idea what about . One of the things that really threw me for a loop was how they indicated a step/piece needed to be constructed more than once . In normal construction manuals they use a simple " x2 " or " x4 " notation to indicate multiples . In the Mega Size guides they have a red box featuring the number and a whole bunch of Japanese writing . If I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit I would have never known what those notes stood for . <p> Perhaps the most unique aspect of a Mega Size model is how large sections are made by piecing two runners together . Instead of building multiple joints independently the guide instructs you to take a runner , add polycap joints , and a fix it to another conjoining runner.Squeeze them together , break free , and you 've done twice the work in half the time . The kit also includes a pair of pliers meant for pulling pieces from the runner . This simplifies the construction process for children and spares them the trouble of twisting and pulling parts off the runner . Most gunpla modelers will still snip and sand down the pieces prior to construction for the best results . <p> 1/48 Mega Size kits are designed to be statuesque which has left posability lacking for those familiar with Master and Perfect Grade kits . It ca n't quite make it down on one knee but a 360 degree joint in the forearm allows a higher range of motion in the arms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for in playability . Most of the polycap parts on the kit have little notches which , along with the tightness of the joints , allow them to hold positions incredibly well . <p> These enhancements are incredibly important considering the beam rifle and shields are equivalent in size to a 1/144 scale kit . The shield is fairly simplistic , consisting of only three pieces , but makes up for it in detail . The beam rifle , I forgot what they call it on the show , is able to spin in the middle so that both hands can grasp the weapon . <p> As with other Mega Size models AGE comes with two sets of fixed hands , one a pair of closed fists and the other locked in a grasping position . The grasping hands look their best while holding the rife . While not as pronounced as those equipped with the 1/48 RX-78-2 they look somewhat awkward while holding the beam sabers . <p> I do like that Bandai not only included full length beam effect pieces with the kit but the short dagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit and provide more action pose possibilities . <p> Light Gimmick <p> Perhaps the coolest part of this kit is that the torso and head light up . The first real gimmick of the Mega Size line is perhaps the best LED addition Bandai has ever done . Those who who have built older Perfect Grade kits know that wiring up LEDs can be pretty painful at times , especially when a single power source is used for torso and head LEDs . The 1/48 AGE manages to light both areas using the same LED unit Bandai introduced over a year ago . <p> The unit conveniently sits in the backpack and utilizes a quick twist of the lower thruster to turn on/off . <p> The light then bounces around inside . From the rear of the kit the light is channeled through a large white cavity and out the front of the chest mounted A. At the same point the LED enters the torso a large clear plastic piece picks up the green LED 's light and channels it up into the head . There it encounters more clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's essentially a thick fiber optic system . The only downside is that in optimizing the light for the front of the head a white piece has been added internally separating the light source from the head 's rear green sensor . In other words , the back of the head does n't light up . <p> The whole system works incredibly well allowing the kit to light up brightly . Surprisingly I did n't have to adjust any photo settings to capture the proper effect in my photos . For those not interested in the light up gimmick Bandai included a pair of white stickers to apply behind the eyes and head A unit . <p> Now get this , the kit actually comes with the batteries needed for the LED . I 'm not sure if Bandai has done this in the recent Gundam 00 kits but to have batteries where even PG kits do not is a huge leap forward in convenience . <p> In Conclusion <p> The designs from Gundam AGE seem to be among the most hotly contested . On a personal level I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . It 's a design that sits securely along the gray line between beautiful and ugly . From one angle I 'm a fan , from another I 'm not . The 1/48 Mega Size Gundam AGE has only helped deepen the debate . Now aspects I had concerns about earlier pose no issues while others previously looked past now stand out like a sore thumb . Maybe that 's part of why I like this kit so much . Its size and simplicity allow me to really consider the design as a whole . <p> Design of the Gundam aside , this kit from Bandai is to be appreciated all around . It may be as simple as kits get but the detail and though that went into the unit is nothing to be scoffed at . It 's able to offer challenges and a plethora of options to an advanced gunpla modeler while being so simple and easy to build that even those new to the hobby will have little difficulty .

Here is the 2015 Gunpla Release Predictions.Please note that the following info are only predictions and not confirm releases What are your Gunpla release prediction for 2015 ? Leave us your comment below . <p> The protagonist lead mobile suits of the two latest Gundam anime series , Gundam Build Fighters and Gundam : Reconguista in G. These mobile suits should have the highest probability of getting a release in 2015 <p> The above possible releases were teased way back at the 2012 Gunpla Expo in Japan , At the time , the Z'gok was also teased and was eventually released in 2014 . Perhaps the GM , Gundam Ground Type and Gouf will get their release this year.60% Release Probability : - RG Gundam Deathscythe EW - RG Gundam Deathscythe Hell EW - RG Gundam Sandrock EW - RG Gundam Heavyarms EW - RG Shenlong EW <p> With the recent release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty likely another Wing series mobile suit will get a RG treatment . <p> With the recent release of HGBF R-GyaGya , it is possible that we may see the release of the original Jyajya . And since HGAW Gundam Air Master was released mid 2014 , perhaps we will see the Gundam Leopard make its HGAW debut . <p> HGUC Kapool makes perfect sense since they can release different color variants for ZZ and Turn A. <p> I am not holding my breath on ANY ver KA 2.0 releases . It would imply that they were n't perfect as released . <p> I am really curious to see the results of the 1/100 RE experiment going in to 2015 . Will that line continue or fade away ? <p> I HIGHLY DOUBT we will see a MG Gundam ' The Origin Ver . ' this year because the current OVA release seems to be focused on Char 's story . I would n't expect the Gundam to show up in this episode of the Origin OVA at all . <p> I will love to see them make a remake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing though that technically Freedom and Strike Freedom is mainly designed by the DX it would be nice to see what a UC version would actually look like if AW did n't have less technology . <p> Xi/Penelope as RE/100 's would be a disaster considering that they 're the most advanced Gundams ever made and it 's the least detailed line of all of them . You 're dreaming with Wing RG kits too .... we see 00 getting both it 's lead character suits and NOTHING else . No reason Wing will be any different . RG is for main character suits and UC grunts . Look for the FAZZ or Infinite Justice . <p> I disagree . The Xi/Penelope is too big and too costly to make as an MG . Just look at the Nightingale . Just because they are the most advanced Gundams ever made does n't automatically warrant it a Master Grade . Imagine how complex the construction will be . Now , imagine what the final price will be . BANDAI would not be able to break even for at least half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the RE/100 Nightingale as a baseline , that would put the Xi/Penelope MG upwards into PG price territory . That 's too much risk for BANDAI . <p> RG Justice and Skygrasper are n't really kits of main character suits . They 're kits of a popular main supporting character 's suit and a support craft with extra accessories to complete the RG Strike 's arsenal respectively . If those can make it to RG , I see no reason why the other Gundams from EW ca n't , especially when all the MG kits share the same inner frame . However , I will say that since we have had the frame for the RX-78-2 since the RG line started , Bandai could have released the GM at any time they wished , considering that it is supposed to be a MP RX-78 and shares almost exactly the same body , save a few key areas like the head , skirts , knees/shins , and backpack . It does seem kind of odd that they 've waited this long to release it . <p> I 've also seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while it does have its problems , it certainly does not lack detail . Actually , all the RE kits I 've seen here look pretty well detailed , definitely more so than the 1/144 HGs that have come out in the last few years . <p> Why do you think those 3 are nicer choices ? Of course , you hate UC and is still upset that a suit from that timeline is the latest PG product ! ( This comment came from a fan of both UC and some AU timelines ) <p> They can not release the Green psychoframe parts as an upgrade set . Disassembling the unicorn completely will cause damage to the model as some parts are practically locked together . Do n't  talk about stuff you have no clue about . And stop spamming your dumb comments . <p> I second that there has been a lot of people doing custom builds of the seed and seed destiny line . Although a rg infinite justice and legend with a Providence resin and conversion Kit would be at the top of my list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was the angel wings version I do n't think they would make another wing gundam version just yet ..... even though they made exia and astrae versions but that 's because it 's practically the same build while the wing gundam would have to be done from scratch just so they can make the original the zero version and the ew version . So if they do make another one from th ew series best bet it would be gundam heavy arms ew ... but I would really like them to make unicorn full armor or hi-nu <p> The next RG 00 design is probably either going to be Dynames or Virtue . Anything that can use Exia 's frame . Those things are a long ways off though . I personally want a RG Gouf Custom , Kampfer , or Gelgoog , and they still have n't come out with the normal Z'Gok . The line needs more kits of non-Gundams . <p> Actually , he has every right to spam his wishlists and voice his opinions . Yes , he can very annoying , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pay for HIS hobbies ) , but even with that , he 's not forcing anyone to do anything . <p> Yes , he can voice his opinion . But he actually forces his opinion to others by spamming them and proclaiming how " absolute " his list and how " mighty " his " predictions " compared to others and insulting the opinion of other people . And spamming makes things worse . <p> Though it 's ben known for awhile , it was kinda unexpected that the Dijeh was announced to be the next RE kit , considering the first 3 were kinda obscure , and were never shown in animation , whereas the Dijeh was animated , and piloted by Amuro Ray , of all characters . The RG line is apparently devoted towards 1/100 kits of suits that wo n't likely get MG releases though , and I guess Dijeh does kinda fit the bill . Either way , the line is open to a lot of other oddities . RE 1/100 G-Saviour , Anyone ? <p> MG ! ! ! ! ! PLEEEEEEEEEEEASE ! ! ! ! ! ITS NEVER ON ANY RELEASE LIST BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ! It 's the most badass of all Dom variations ! Get your head on right bandai and release it ! Other than that the MG Zaku II and RG line looks cool . But seriously . MG or RG MS-09F . I would trade all my kits for one MG Tropen . <p> Hate to burst your bubble buddy ; sadly its most likely not gon na happen ... Not picking on you or anything like that ... to me it seem like there is a bandai boardroom with reps and execs. pitching MS and sample kits and popularity of the most recognizable from a certain series good or bad is what they mass produce to public ... lots of prototype kits that never made it in MG line ... it took Marasai and The O several times before they got release . I love the Dom Tropen just as much as you ! ! I have both HGUC kits desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular MG Dom &amp; paint it up ... Usually 3rd party companies take advantage of bandai 's kits producing parts to frames that already exist ... like the Barzam Kai which is just a cosmetic upgrade to Gundam MkII . <p> T is alright , my bubble is barely even inflated lol . I know how they do all the picking and stuff and I 've come to terms with fact that the tropen will probably never get a MG treatment due to its lack of popularity . A guy can hope though ! And I 'm glad there is another Dom Tropen lover out there ! And I 've been planning on attempting a scratch build conversion kit for my MG Dom I have , just have n't gotten around to it yet . And I have the desert variation but lost the standard variation when I moved a few years back . <p> i liked the predictions . MG Build Burning will be amazing , i do n't think we will see the MG Gundam the origin this year because the first series will focus on Char , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be nice . and maybe this year we will finally see the V2 and loved the idea of having a MG X Divider wich is one of my favorites Gundams also any think that comes out from Zeta Gundam is nice , especially grunts.I do n't think we will see a lot of RGs from Gundam Wing , maybe just one more like the Wing Gundam , i wanted to see more grunts like the GM , Gouf or something outside Wing , Seed and 00 for a change , i would love to see a RG Gundam X , Turn A , F91 or the God Gundam.NIce predictions , i hope we get to see a lot of these kits in 2015 , i 'm really excited for all the great possibilities we have . <p> That 's better than your reasons for wishing a PG Exia/QanT/Freedom . A PG for those three are also interesting ( especially Qant ) but he reasons why you wished for that is because of your anti-UC rants and because your uncured OCD forces you to collect the lead suits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box fortress . <p> Well I cant predict anything . But out of these predictions here are the ones I 'd be most excited for <p> PG Banshee would be really happy with this but my wallet is frightenedMG Gundam The OriginMG Zaku II 3.0 they need to do this one . Im surprised it has n't  happened yetRG GM hell yes -this was on the potential release list when the RG line was announcedRG Ground Type hell yesRG Gouf hell yesRG Deathscythe Hell meh , but the best of the potential wing releases <p> the Banshee is already a given , though i think it would be released late this year or maybe at 2016 with the Norn upgrade set as a P-bandai exclusive . Full Armor Unicorn as a regular release is highly unlikely because the FA set is already released as a P-bandai exclusive . Green Psychoframe ver of both gundam will probably be P-bandai exclusives too . : ) <p> PG Phenex will be a regular release . <p> this is more of a wishlist , but i hope they release G-unit gundams ( Geminass , Griepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of them . <p> Plus , several of its parts , like its feet , waist , and " wings " are colored with gradients instead of solid colors , which ca n't be done with plastic alone , at least not with the modeling technology we have now . It would need to be painted , or use stickers like the Hi-Nu ver.Ka , which I highly doubt would work well with the ELS QanT 's design or the colors ' supposed placement , especially on the feet . <p> While there 's little doubt we 're getting model kits from The Origin , I 'm quite surprised to see the Kshatriya omitted from this list . Unicorn seems to be a hot property at present , so I 'd be surprise me if Bandai eased off of it now . I 'd definitely welcome a MG Gerbera Tetra but I 'm somewhat concerned about it being back heavy and for the love of all that is holy Bandai can we get some Wing and OO grunt suit love ? <p> Terrible prediction.This is fangasmic prediction , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGs RGs and REs . <p> My prediction would be .. <p> PGPG Unicorn Gundam BansheeP-Bandai Norn Expansion Set <p> As appear in PGUC kit there are some rotating gauges that they would make anything similar of banshee and Riddhe figures . moreover , making Norn expansion unit is a no-brainer to display along side FA Unicorn , which is suppose that yellow LED unit will come with it.Green psychoframe i would predict that Bandai would not making it , since I know that most people prefer red one over green one.Maybe might come out as P-Bandai who knows ? . <p> MGP-Bandai Gundam Astray Turn RedG-selfBuild Burning <p> Bandai release artwork of this work twice , where the 2nd time there was some length adjustment to the handler of the 2 swords on the back , making it a bit longer , for some particular reason . furthermore Bandai has already have Astray molds and Tactical Arm mold too and have P-Bandai of Astray Noir and plain Red Frame for Destiny Astray series.This is a high probability . <p> RERE 1/100 Deep Striker <p> In P-Bandai S Gundam Bst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rotating gauges and the torn runners that they can be making into a bigger one.MG of this will nearly cost over 400-500 bucks that Bandai will not take any chance . So a another no-brainer one for RE series like Bandai always making a monstrous kit in RE <p> For Seravee , Bandai used to nake poll of RG Dynames and Virtue but a think they will skip it to Season 2 series instead.Seravee has a nice cast of gimmick , plus GNHW including in the kit.GNHW P-Bandai ? , nahhh ridiculous.But Maybe in P-Bandai Seravee Gundam GNHW/3G <p> They totally botched the RE/100 predictions ... They emphasized the 30th anniversary of zeta soooo much and with the release of Dejih coming out spring 2015 ; i 'd say the next RE kit should most likely be an Titans TMS/MS , Axis MS , or perhaps another Z-MSV . I 'd personally like to see a 1/100 Guncannon Detector , Gabthley , or Gaza-D/C . I 'd LOVE to see an MG Jegan but you can guarantee that P-bandai would be all over Stark Jegan attachments ! Hope 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy building ! <p> Considering the F90 's lineart was used to make the Gay Robot posters in Grandma 's Boy , I would think that if MG F90 were real , it would be a matter of time before a crapload of custom jobs based on the design would start appearing . <p> I do think RE/100 is used to payback some profit from those Custom kit and Chinese kit not only becase Bandai ca n't charge them forever but also because some of them is really better than Bandai 's job . <p> Think for HG they would release essentially a " 2.0 " Gouf along with Zaku II , Zaku I , and GM . They have the R35 Gouf , those high mobility type Zaku IIs and Thunderbolt Zakus and GM to work with . Why not work with them and give us an update to the outdated GM and Zaku II ? Tired of fancy gundams from the RG line , where are the GMs , Ground Gundams , and the grunts ? MG wise do n't  they have a GNX-IV from Trailblazer they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ground assault guntank from ms igloo still . <p> MG Amazing Exia as a P-Bandai is a possibility though .. I 'm hoping for RE 1/100 Kshatriya ( but it ai n't  gon na happen ) , the PGs are quite accurate IMO ... I do n't  know much about the RG but bandai did a poll earlier to know which RG do people want do they ? and it was the Virue ( or was it the dynames ? ) <p> I do n't know about you guys but I 'm hoping for the MG lightning , MG build burning , and MG Geara Zulu : ) <p> Why Gundam Double X is always left behind ? for example in HG Model kit , another one is on MG Kits ... Gundam Double X takes a long time before they plan to make it in different Grades . To think that this MS or series is a big hit too , and one more think Gundam Double X is the main character of one of the gundam series .

@@35099477 @4099477/ <p> I am not sure if I am surprised or not . I am not surprised they are doing a Banshee but I was thinking they might try the regular Banshee first . Though that would be a brick for the arms . I am also surprised they are doing the yellow psycoframe with the Norn as they always like to show it with the blue/green psycoframe <p> My guess is that they are going to include the conversion parts for the regular Banshee . According to Gundam Wikia , the PG Unicorn was ( http : **36;300;TOOLONG ) 20,000 Yen . So my guess with the extra 2,000 Yen might be parts for the regular Banshee 's weapons ? I mean most of it will just be a recolor of the PG Unicorn right ? And then with the add on weapons . <p> A September release for a PG ? To be honest , I was expecting for this to be a P-Bandai release . I guess since it is not , then we can expect like the Norn ( green &amp; yellow ) to be P-Bandai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh and I expect to see a P-Bandai for the green Full Armor Unicorn . <p> Anyway , I was kind of hoping for a PG Exia or PG 00 Qant next . I guess Bandai is n't done milking the Unicorn series still . <p> Nope , it will not be a P-Bandai release because it is n't just a simple recolor and it has a big role in Episode 7 ( and it being a P-Bandai as a MG is pure BS on Bandai 's part ) . Anyways , this whole P-Bandai project is still a big BS . <p> And being part of the UC timeline , Unicorn will enjoy future releases since kits from that timeline are still selling very well despite their series ended , although having a new series will surely boost their sales more . <p> Tsk Tsk , suiton. when will you get it through your thick skull ? bandai will NEVER make kits just for you . they do n't  give a crap about your wishlist. they will make kits their way and do n't  care what consumers have against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kit in PG as well as any other kit get PG treatment other than the Exia and Qant , the NT- ! Alex . THAT would be a great PG . <p> Yeah suiton , I 'd like to see PG Quant , or , more probably Exia . But I think Bandai is waiting for 10th anniversary of 00 . Then they 'll release 1st sesason suits in MG and ' ll do modernized HG 's . Like they had done with Seed/Destiny.1st Anonymous:you do n't have to be so rude . And have n't you noticed that Bandai in PG line only does lead suits ( with few exceptions ) ?

I mean I guess waiting for the 10th anniversary would be a good thing but it 's already been about 6 years since Gundam 00 ended ( season 2 ) , and about 5 since the movie aired . I think it 's a pretty decent amount for a relatively small PG to get released which is why I thought maybe Exia or 00 Qant as they could probably reuse some things from the PG 00 Raiser to cut down on costs . <p> PG Banshee Norn just seems very excessive to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like 90% reusing the PG Unicorn , but why even the Norn version ? <p> Like with PG Unicorn , Bandai went from 1 to 2.1 being the original , and then 2 being the " upgrade " . Yet with the Banshee , we got 2 and but most like 1 as a Premium Bandai release . <p> And then now we 're left with both of those getting their green color version ... <p> I 'd love to see a Quant as much as the next gundam lover , same with Exia , but frankly Bandai does n't give a rat 's ass what you want suiton , and they do n't care what I want , they look at the most poplular gundams and make exclusives and variants , and also frankly , Exia and Quantt just do n't have enough popularity to justify a PG release . I personally the 00 Raiser , but that 's just me . <p> Bandai already has 1/60 Exia so they do n't  need to make a pg , exia does n't have that many mechanics/details in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ever be 1/60 , if you try to make him hold the GN Buster Sword or Rifle its just going to fall . Exia can have a RG but unicorn ca n't because of those psychoframes so they just made it a PG . That 's also why the HG unicorn gundams cant transform . <p> " If you deny that a PG Exia or PG 00 Qant would be a good candidate for PG , then you 're lying or just too dumb to realize . " <p> Vintage suiton , what a pathetic response for people who do n't share similar opinions with you and stick to their more reasonable beliefs instead . Its you who is either lying to yourself or too stupid to realize that Unicorn is still selling very well and the only reason why you want your 00 golden boys in another PG kit is because of your own still untreated OCD to complete lead Gundam kit 's boxes . Also , you 're still upset that UC kits are still getting more kits instead of those in your stupid wishlist . <p> U.C. Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take priority in model kits .. Just my thoughts .. Bandai does n't  care what you or a particular consumer thinks . Bandai only cares about public demands and popularity .. when you look into a business point of view , any business/company will not make any product that is not popular or low in demand ... <p> The Unicorn has always been profitable . A PG kit that actually nailed the tranformation , and was actually posable , was a guaranteed money maker . Ironically the need for the base to use the LEDs is what turned it into a brick . <p> You 'll be able to use the standard Unicorn LED unit for the Banshee , I guarantee it . That 's because the LEDs in the Unicorn set are n't colored LEDs , but UV LEDs . Those will make clear plastic light up as it passes through , regardless of what color the plastic is . <p> You know , this is getting ridiculous with the Unicorn kit spamming they 've been doing for years now . Why could n't they do like a PG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been awesome and they would n't have costed Bandai as much money to develop . <p> Ridiculous ? Unicorn just finished last year . Of course the will release the a PG Banshee to go with the PG unicorn and no the led wo n't be a P Bandai release .. Why would Bandai make a PG of a shitty kit like exia or qant when the MG is such a bad design it ca n't even stand under its own weight . Face it OO fanboy . You picked a serious that does n't have the popularity of the UC timeline . I 'll bet good money Bandai will announce a new series before a PG exia . <p> What 's really ridiculous is your wish list spamming and crying about not get what you want like a 5 year old child . Bandai does care about you and what you want they care about profit and what will actually sell . Your a prime example of the result of shitty parenting in today 's society .

Geez I 'm sure most of wish our biggest concern in life was why bandai wo n't make that 20+ kits I want and how may different post I can spam with usless bs . <p> Suiton , just admit the fact that you 're just upset that Bandai continues to release kits from the Unicorn line ( and the UC timeline in general ) along with some AU ones instead of those in your wishlists. 
@@35099479 @4099479/ <h> 83 comments : <p> Is it a Master Grade ? I mean , the HG had the HG1/144 on it in the announcement , why not this ? it just says 1/100I know the Inner Frame is a slight edge to that , but it looks so simple . I hope it come with the huge Mace though . XD <p> Beautiful kit ! But if this is their next MG after Amazing Red Warrior , then where 's the MG G-Self and Build Burning Gundam ? At least we should get one of those two before this gets released . ( Words coming from a guy who likes HG kits ) <p> Correct me if i am wrong , a kit is called MG because it has inner frame and 1:100 scale . This one has inner frame and 1:100 , but the price is too cheap for a MG these days , also no MG on its name . Regardless , I will still buy this one ( unless there will be an announcement for MG Gundam Barbatos ) <p> That was what i 'm thinking too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if it does n't  have inner frame that is call non grade/ re 100 model , so waiting for new anouncement right now for sure , when i saw this i was suprise , how mg so ceap , but then i saw there was no mg logo , so yeah thinking and waiting <p> Earlier master grades did n't have full inner frames - I believe this is just a new no grade 1/100 line to go with the upgrading gimmick of the Gundam Barbatos - while I think it 's really neat - I will just be waiting for a master grade which will probably be announced some time after the series is over <p> The Master Grade line has been more about details and articulation . The early MGs had way more detail compared to their 1/144 equivalents ( as these were originally PG innovations brought down to 1/100 size ) , the addition of the inner frame along the line was done in service of adding more detail and articulation . <p> It is inevitable that as time passed , we 're seeing stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as High Grade ( both the 1/144 and 1/100 Gundam Barbatos have inner frames ) , though compared to the contemporary Master Grade , that 's still not enough detail and articulation . <p> It looks to me like this is actually a new 1/100 " No Grade " kit . I mean sure there is an inner frame and it is 1/100 in scale , but it looks to me like something we see with the Frame Arms line where we have a common frame for all/many mechs with just changes to armor . <p> And was n't the point of Barbatos Gundam to be an incomplete mech that adds parts and weapons from defeated enemies ? <p> In that regard , maybe there is n't going to be a Master Grade kit per say . And instead just these updated 1/100 No Grade kits ? I mean for all we know , we could get armor packs to reflect the major evolutions of Barbatos . <p> I mean if this 1/100 ( i.e. non Master Grade ) kit looks this good , I 'm not really sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's what I 'm thinking too . Basically I think this is like a 1/100 gimmick line , with armor packs , weapons and other mobile suits with the same frame being released later to make upgrades from the show and customs . It 's a great idea , especially as the price seems lower than MGs . There might be a Mg with greater details , more complexity and better articulation coming later . I really hope they release a Glaze ( ? ) in this line . <p> I smell something fishy here , its said it used the same frame like other suit in this seriers but getting stronger as it upgrade the armor , and weapon etc . I see more armor parts coming , and do n't forget the weapon parts as we can see in HG . Well done bandai , so this is how you sell the kits now . <p> It 's a gunpla with dlc 's . Well played bandai , well played . They knew the HG Barbatos is selling like hot cakes , and they release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care , as long they shell some money to sunrise to maintain/improve the anime quality , then i would n't mind . <p> And this is what caught me by surprise , we all know ( and correct me if I 'm wrong ) that the RE/100 line is the new replacement and successor to the 1/100 No Grade line . This guy has no MG nor a RE/100 Logo on him . Plus even if it is a No Grade then it would n't have an inner frame since No Grades are ' basically slightly bigger and better HGs . " <p> I never saw the RE line as a replacement for anything . It was basically a way to release cheaper plastic versions of older resin kits of obscure MS . This way fans of the designs get a large kit while Bandai minimizes the risk of spending lots of time and money in developing a MG kit of a design that many people might not like . <p> As impressive as this guy looks , the fact that it is so cheap and more than likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase this . I think if I were to get into this line of GunPla , I would just wait for the Master Grade . <p> Though this gets me wondering if we 're going to get MGs for this series and how much more they could do for it compared to this 1/100 No Grade .... <p> I mean aside from making the inner frame that this model has a bit more detailed with clear parts , more articulation , and of course an opening cockpit with a pilot figure inside ... I du n no . Oh and I suppose MG hands too ... <p> I get the feeling that we 're going to get this base model as a Master Grade and then get add on packs released for this guy instead . <p> Damn it . I can already see myself getting like multiples of this kit ... &gt;&lt; <p> Damn you Bandai for making GunPla so " fun to build " ( i.e. more like fun to buy ... lol ) <p> well , we already know that 1/100 non grade scale line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAM ! .... RE/100 arrived with obscure mobile suit from UC timeline ( which i like all of ' em , btw ) <p> in this 1/100 , i see Bandai trying to make 1/100 nongrade G-TEKKETSU series which would be like SEED nongrade line , with cheaper massproduced plastic used on RE/100 or years ago . that would explain why the price in this line could be so cheap . <p> I think the innerframe is detailed , but . The detail one is on the back frame , look closely to the back side photo , i think bandai is have an oppinion of " why do we have to detailed the innerframe behind the armor ? though , It will hide when weattach the armor " <p> : Looking at this makes me more and more interested in the anime , but in regards to kits , I think I am going to hold off and wait for an eventual Master Grade release ; that is unless this 1/100 is the best we 're gon na get . <p> This is possibly the ugliest piece of crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous .... like come on bandai wtf , did they have their 3rd string design team cook up this garbage ? Let 's just stick to the gundam gods katoki or kunio please ... <p> I 'd say its refreshing over the usual ' super robot ' okawara and the ' squarish ' design of katoki . The design of Barbatos evokes the idea of primitive and savage ; when was the last time you see an MS with a conventional huge-ass Mace as its starting weapon ? <p> the Strike is a tactical MS hence daggers ( later has aile pack so its moot ) , and the Astray Red 's Gerbera Straight is just pretentious in the world of beam sabers and lasers . I 'm stoked to see how far the series gon na make barbatos using primitive weapons as its main armament . <p> well , we already know that 1/100 non grade scale line was pretty much dead since SEED non grade line , then BAM ! .... RE/100 arrived with obscure mobile suit from UC timeline ( which i like all of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandai trying to make 1/100 nongrade G-TEKKETSU series which would be like SEED nongrade line , with cheaper massproduced plastic used on RE/100 or years ago . that would explain why the price in this line could be so cheap . <p> People keep mentioning this is " very cheap " and one of the reasons this is a NG over a MG . Do you guys have hugely marked up prices from imports where you get your kits from ? Granted I live in Tokyo and do n't need to import and I just bought MG Double X for 2800 yen last week ( 100 yen more than this NG Barbatos ) which is a recent MG kit ( April 2015 ) and there 's many other kits this price . Even hi-nu Gundam ver ka MG is just 3200 yen which is n't that big a leap from this ( only 5 bucks ) ... there 's quite a few RG 's that despite being 1/144 are easily 2200-2700 .. maybe because of the increased number of indiviual plastic parts and huge amount of decals . <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like the chest and shoulders are scrunched up and aligns with the hip width ... i have n't jumped on the HG 1/144 because i want the 1/100 for the size and inner frame details but i 'm waiting for actual reviews and more photos for the 1/100 proportions . so far i 'm not liking the 1/100 proportions , based on what i 'm seeing . the HG 1/144 overall propportion looks better . and there 's no mace ! ! ! &gt;. &lt; <p> Petty cool that both the HG and NG have inner frames . Looks like Bandai is going with the same route as Build Fighters and will release weapon , armor sets for these kits . I 'll wait for a MG . Imagine how awesome the inner frame would be on that thing ? ! <p> This looks nice for those who want a 1/100 scale of the Barbatos without the usual Master Grade price.But I honestly do n't find this kit to be worth it at all . <p> I think it 's likely that we will see a Master Grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grade has an inner frame ( albeit not a complete one ) , Bandai could and should release a Master Grade with proper color separation , clear parts , etc . <p> Even if that means we will get the other variations and weapons via add on packs like how they 've been handling the HG line . <p> On top of that , this 1/100 does not have the mace weapon ? That is basically the signature weapon of the Barbatos is it not ? Why do they include a katana and a bazooka with this ? Makes no sense . If anything it should at least come with the mace and that 's it ; making an option set for the bazooka , katana , etc . <p> *sigh* c'm on you guys ? Go google and search ? Yes it is look like MG but not detailed enough ... looks like hg , actually this one bandai specialized made for the iron blooded orphan only ... it stand in the middle between hg and mg . Yes of course most people thought it was mg because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it MG ? If u guys still asking about the grade ? It is non graded ... just iron blooded orphan scale 1/100 ... quality is better than HG but not good as MG.

Maybe we 'll get lucky and get G Gundam and Gundam X as well ? <p> You know , I get that Sunrise x Bandai want to put out all the Gundam animes through these boxsets in BluRay since the VHS , Laser Disc , and DVDs are outdated these days , but damn ... seriously ? <p> 34,000 ? !

Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxsets like this for Gundam 00 and maybe also G , X , Wing , Seed HD , Seed Destiny HD ... But not at these crazy ass prices . <p> Maybe if RightStuf can get their hands on the Gundam franchise , they 'll release them at more reasonable prices ; even if it means Japanese with English subtitles only and none of these excessive bonus items . <p> It 's no wonder why people pirate these BluRay Gundam episodes more than buying it . Bandai X Sunrise are charging way too much money for them . Or are these prices the norm in Japan ? ? <p> That is very normal in Japan . Electronic media are more in Japan due to less resources as well as to balance cost-to-sales . Also , Japan 's economy is far more stable than ours ( In the US ) , and even though the yen is weaker than the dollar , the average pay rate and cost of living are far more balanced .

Maybe this time they will do a Blast Impulse in HG ; even if it 's through Premium Bandai . <p> Just includes a individual mode . The fighter seems too small to transform though I will say that the face the fighter in it 's compacted mode with the single peg hole and the Impulse having two peg holes naturally really opens up all sorts of customization idea with it . I must say this is a really well done and amazing look kit just from the proportions and design alone .

For a long time early in my Gundam building career , I would n't even pay attention to the HG releases , and for that I am sorry . While Master Grades are great in their own right , they are much slower to be released , the scope of the kits is much narrower , focusing generally on lead mobile suits or classic grunts and because of the costs of producing such complex kits , Bandai seems less willing to take a risk . Aside from maybe MG The O or the Guntank , the MG releases have been safe . <p> I first really got into the HG line because of the kits from the Unicorn series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , the diversity of the releases and the lower price point that the HG line tends to offer . Even though I still prefer the 1/100th scale of the MGs or the seemingly extinct NG line , the releases from the various HG lines are something I look forward to . <p> The Jesta is a release that I have been anticipating ever since the first news of its impending release . I did n't  know anything about the MS itself except for the design , but that was all I really needed since I think the design looks amazing . So , after bit of a wait , its finally here and I get to tell you all about it . <h> Packaging &amp; Instructions : <p> Not much else I can say here for that the box art that I have n't said in my other reviews except that the pictures and information on the box and in the manual are all top-notch . The awesome illustration on the box lid shows the Jesta team in action attacking or defending against some unseen enemy and of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the box . The manual repeats a lot of the pictures that were used on the box as well as some other pictures and information of the Jesta itself and various other notable suits from the Unicorn continuity . Standard stuff for the HGUC line , but it works . It may be time for a refresh on the layout and format of these things , especially after seeing the HG Gundam AGE packaging . <h> Runners &amp; Colors : <p> There is not a lot of color in this kit , which is just fine by me . The majority of color is the dark blue that we have seen in the past used for the Titans group MSs as well as the Musha Gundam MK . II . There is also a light blue/grey color used for the secondary areas such as the upper arms , thighs and as detail pieces . There is also the medium grey often used for inner frames or joints and there is a singular clear orange piece used for the eye/sensor array . The contrast between the two blues works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like the clear orange in the head unit as well as the foil orange stickers for the rifle sites . There is a sheet of water slides to designate suit unit numbers , team alliances , etc. as well if you plan to build a squad or something . <h> Build &amp; Gimmicks <h> This is a quick and easy build ; nothing too fancy going on here except for a few areas . I was happy to see that there is some quality color separation here that is not achieved by stickers , using plastic instead . Specifically on the front skirts and the chest , the light blue plastic really looks good among all of the dark blue , and its so good that there are n't  stickers used here . The head also uses several colors of plastic instead of just one , and that really helps to make head " pop " . <p> There are a few bland areas , though . The shield specifically could use some more color , especially on the missile tips or whatever that is supposed to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that these things are white in the illustration and product shots along the side , but they are in-fact a solid , monochrome piece . And there are n't  even any stickers to help , so you need to use a Gundam Marker or some paint to make it look its best , but that 's not too big of a deal . <p> The shield does have another problem , though . Unlike most shields in the Gundamverse , the shield for the Jesta attaches to the backpack by way of solid piece of plastic . Actually , Bandai has seen fit to include two different options to connect the backpack and shield together , which would leave you to believe that at least one of the two works well . But , you 're sort of mistaken . <p> The two different connectors are simple ; one is a " collapsed " version and the other is an " open " version . The better choice , for me at least , is the open version . Both ends of the connector pieces pegs into a polycap which allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough . Where the arm attaches to the backpack , there is no up/down movement at all , just a little forward/backward . And where it attaches to the shield , there is some swivel and outward , unfolding wing sort of action , but its still not enough . The shield can only cover the side of the left arm unit , it ca n't reach to the front , nor can it be attached to the right side of the backpack , even though there is a polycap for it to do so . These arms are designed asymmetrically , and there is too much plastic in the way to go on the other side . Though , I plan to do a test on the collapsed version to see if I can sand enough of the plastic away so it can function on either side . <p> Another big flaw in the design of these two pieces is that there are large , empty areas in the most visible side of the arms . One side has nicely sculpted detail , the side that faces away backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the kit loses a lot of that detail and instead has pretty noticeable gaps in the plastic . When the whole kit is assembled , a lot of the open areas are covered by the rest of the kit , but I know that they are there . <p> In my opinion , Bandai should have given us just one arm with no gaps in the plastic and also make it so that one has the ability to move in some way . This is definitely a downside to HG kits ; most of the time , everything is boiled down to its most simple form which gives us an arm that is supposed to be able to move but instead , its a solid chunk of plastic . <p> Even though I have complained about it for a while , its not too big of a deal . The shield , although limited in posing options , still looks good and the whole thing works , it just could have been better . But , that just makes me look forward to a ( hopefully ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially with all of the love the Unicorn series is getting from Bandai . I just hope it happens sooner rather than latter , maybe in time for the 5th episode of the OVA . <p> Other aspects of the kit , like the arms , chest and legs , all look great ! Though there is a lot of detail molded into the plastic , there are n't  a lot of pieces that go into making each unit . The legs are probably my favorite parts of this kit as they have a really nice hard edge design with deep channels and good detail . <p> Aside from the problems with the shield and backpack , both are well designed . The shield is pretty small as far as shields go , but it is very angular and thin , giving it a nice look . The backpack is really simply designed , not much mechanical detail at all except for the two thrusters on the bottom . <p> The overall design of this mobile suite comes off as very " stealthy " to me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp lines remind me of those from the decommissioned US B2 Stealth Bomber and I even see some similarities between the Jesta and some of the Stealth Iron Man movie designs . I 'm not saying either is a rip off of the other , but there are shared ideas or parallel design philosophies going on there . <h> Weapons &amp; Accessories : <p> I 've already talked a lot about the shield and backpack , and those two things are a majority of the accessories we get in this kit . There are a few other things , though . A Beam Carbine serves as the long range weapon , there is a single beam saber handle that is stored in the left forearm , and both side skirts house a three pack of grenades.The Beam Carbine looks pretty nice . Its not your typical beam rifle design ; rather it looks more like a burley machine gun or something . The construction is simple , just three pieces slapped together , and no moving parts . The site has orange foil stickers for either side , which is pretty nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no channel lines or anything , just a thin cylinder capped off by a little thicker cylinder . Its cool that it is stored in the forearm , though . And the grenades are simply there for aesthetic purposes . You could probably cut them all apart so you would have three single grenades as opposed to one set of three , but that seems like too much work . <p> Lastly , we get seven manipulators . There is one trigger finger hand , two closed fists , two open hands and two beam saber holding hands . The closed fists hands are unique to me since the thumb and closed fingers are separate , each plugging into the palm section . I do n't  think I 've seen that before in a HG , but maybe I have . I do n't  see a real advantage to doing it this way , but its interesting I guess . <p> And that 's it for weapons and accessories , which is kind of odd to me . The Jesta is a grunt suit , meant to work in teams of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to build a squad out of these guys , which is awesome . And a lot of the other grunt suits Ive gotten , various Geara Zulus , Geara Doga , Jagd Doga , Stark Jeagans , etc all have a gun and a bazooka and sometimes something else . So , if you do want to build a squad , you 're going to have to borrow someone elses weapons to get some uniqueness going on . Banda did give us a lot of sticker choices , though . So that 's something , at least . <h> Appearance &amp; Articulation <p> As I have said before , this kit looks great . I really like the simple color scheme , the orange accent pieces/stickers and the sharp lines . I do n't  think there is anything about the design of the kit that would make me tell someone not to get it . As long as you like the more real-life militaristic design , you should love this . But , this is no pink Zaku my boy , no pink Zaku at all . So , if pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or orange Zakus , this may not appeal to you . <p> The articulation is pretty good , too , except for the ankles maybe . There is very little side-to-side movement provided by the ankle joints , so you wont be able to get the legs into too wide of a stance , but there is plenty of forward/backward movement , so you can achieve a good walking pose if that 's what you 're looking for . Otherwise , the legs move forward and backward just fine and off to the side a sufficient amount . There is n't much swivel in the torso , you can only move it to either side about 45 degrees before the side skirts get in the way . The chest unit is one solid piece , so there is no ab-crunch action going on . The shoulders can come away from the chest some , allowing for a nice range of movement and the arms bend to almost 130 degrees or so . The head is free to move all the way around and there is a small amount of neck movement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it again ; it is pretty limited in its ability to move , but that could be me being to on nitpicky about it . <p> One odd thing though is how loose the hands are when holding something . I 've seen this polycap method used time and time again for the wrists and arms to connect together , but for some reason there is n't enough friction there for the hands to stay in position while holding either the Beam Carbine or even the beam saber and blade . But , putting a little glue or putty on the wrist joints should fix that problem . <h> Conclusion : <p> This kit was well worth the wait ! For a little over $20 , you get a great looking kit that really stands out from other grunt suits because of its design and colors . Everything about it is pretty unique in my opinion even though it builds upon the foundations of other MSs , like the Unicorn , Jeagan , Zaku , etc . And even though there are some disappointing areas ; a lack of color separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit is only 20 bucks , so I do n't  think I can reasonably deny its awesomeness . And I wont ; this kit is great . <p> The Unicorn series has provided us with some really unique kits . The Kshatriya , Sinanju , Geara Zulus , Delta Plus , ReZel , Jesta , Loto Twins , and the Dreissen are all great looking MSs and great kits as well . And although a lot of these designs have been around for a long time , the Unicorn books and OVAs helped to spark interest in them , allowing Bandai to release them in various grades . Weve seen other grunt suits from Unicorn get Master Grade releases ; the ReZel has two versions out and the Delta Plus came out just a few months ago , so I think that both the Jesta and Geara Zulu will get Master Grade treatments eventually . But I think first , well see the pretty cool looking Jesta Cannon in HG form and maybe some other variants of it . <p> For now though , do yourself a favor and pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Rg , Excitement embodied , rich colors , gimmick , inner frame and the others . So now they leave " rich colors " word behind ? So what Is the meaning of Rg then ? I ask you , readers , one does not simply Rg without is signature treatment , the colors seperation . And you know what , not only , but also now Rg decal design use on normal kit , like in the hg , example Hguc Fa unicorn Red ver . Even some of Hg origin , and why even they use Rg sticker on the show , like re 0096 ? So what is the purpose of Rg line then ? Rg are Rg , other are other , that what is different between Rg and other grade , just please do n't  mix Rg with another think . Rg are Rg , other are other , that is what we buy Rg line ? Then talk about best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . Why ? Of course because it was the first Rg , and has all Rg characteristic on it , and it was the reason why Rg brand came out . So , yeah that Is the reason . Just please please do n't mix Rg to another think and also do n't leave the Rg signature treatment left behind , if happen , so what is the purpose of the Rg then ? <p> I ca n't believe I read such a bitter comment on this awesome kit . First and foremost , about color separation , we already got the freaking gold here , put the separation color such as two tone red might raise the price to MG price range , RG is the embodiment for exitement and it means to be smaller and cheaper than MG . And also , I ca n't imagine the two tone red on Sinanju because it might destroy it 's image.Secondly , I see no sticker here . If you want to bitch about the decall which is not here on the preview , maybe you forgot about RG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the release kit , they put ot there.Oh also , what 's the purpose of RG you said ? The purpose is to give you the feeling of " Real " gimmick on smaller kits . After all that awesome red , gold , and all those gimmick you still bitter and bitching about it , perharps you can design and build your own kit . <p> about the stickers , he is not complaining about the lack of stickers in this rg sinanju , he is complaining about normal hg having rg-like stickers , thus making the rg " unique " feature redundant . <p> also , despite having of those " real " gimmick you spoke of , it still does n't  live up to the name of rg. yes it is better than the hg but not in a large scale . not like hg rx78 vs rg rx78 . <p> rg is not just a cheap ver of mg , it also should be a high improvement over hg. and rg is supposingly a high end plamo , you can see how they treat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lower release rate than mg . <p> Oooooh okaaaay ? ? First of all , I laughed when I read you said ' I ask you , readers , one does not simply ... ' I imagined you standing on a high platform and preaching the true purpose of RG . You sound ridiculous , to be honest . <p> The color-separation maybe gone which I got disappointed too at first , but then on later announcement they announced that it will have a gold-plated parts in a separate runner ... IN A SEPARATE RUNNER ! ! I 'm sure you are fully aware of the nightmare of its MASTER GRADE 1/100 scale version is that you have to paint the parts gold or apply the gold-trim stickers/water-slide ; but look at what they did on this one , GOLD-PLATED PARTS in a 1/144 scale REAL GRADE ! You did n't see the beauty in that ? ! <p> You may be right at some point though . Personally what I look forward to on new RGs is the size of its sticker sheet they give because that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of stickers became fewer and fewer . RG Skygrasper does n't count . <p> Am i the only one who thinking Katoki decal was better than rg decal ( look The new image , it has sticker put on ) ? and then , for you annon that say about Rg stickers became fewer and fewer , i think you right . The first rg have full sticker that fully using all space in surface , but now they do n't  . <p> Talking about Two tone colors , i think it must still going , even thought it has seperate gold part , they should do it . <p> Even thought that colors seperation was cool , it has own plus and minus . For the plus , it make rg looks more complex , royal , stylish , enginering and looks more reallity ( of course , that 's why it 's called rg ) . For the minus , there will be so many part , especially small part , and that would be nightmare for remove the nub , and if not carefull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most frustating nightmare , must have buy another one then . <p> For Ridho Carnova and other , please be respectfull to each other , do n't judge to fast if you do n't  want get eaten by your own word . If you not carefull when do criticism , you can make hurt his feeling , do you want that thing happen to you ? of course you do n't  , then once again , be respectfull to other , it can be lesson for you . <p> I notice , inside the box you get 3 hand , 2 Holding hands and 1 Open Palm hand , yes there was no trigger finger hand , where i know this , now see some picture carefully that showing sinanju holding his beam rifle ( The picture that have dengeki hobby web word ) . Yes , the Four innex finger are solid ( not including the thumb ) that means it was using the holding hand . Sad but true , and yeah no articullated hand , due for balancing the price range . Correct me if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That means , Hguc sinanju ........... <p> Hmmm so it was included the articulated hands , gee of course , i have to much focus to images and get a bad thing on it , well i think it will be lesson for me. sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , i 'm really sorry for this . Anyway , i think i must be in silence then ..... <p> Looks like we wo n't get articulated fingers with this kit . I 'm still waiting for RG Unicorn ( and other UC MS ) but I doubt it can transform like the MG Unicorn . Maybe Bandai will release it as Unicorn Mode &amp; Destroy Mode like the HG Unicorns . <p> You can look at Dalong.net , then go to HG category to view HGUC Sinanju scans . I recall the Gundam MKII is the simplest RG Gunpla to build due to simplest parts and limited gimmicks . Overall practice building and give RG Sinanju a try if you want to . <p> It 's up to you . I have friend that she starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mistake at first attempt ( some broken or lost parts on rg char 's zaku ) , then she can build other rg normally . In the end , building gunpla is about courage after all , so if you confident and brave enough , just take rg sinanju and carefully read the instruction . <p> I du n no if you should call it " for pro " but yes HG is a lot easier to assemble than RG.Even so it 's not that difficult . Just follow the instructions and you are good to go . RG is a lot more articulated compare to HG . If it was me I would wait for RG . <p> Also if you decide to paint the kit . HG gold part is a bit tricky to paint . <p> Wait for the RG reviews on Youtube . Anyways , if budget is a concern , the HGUC is a solid kit , newer HGs are fantastic and they keep the " anime accurate clean look " RGs and MGs lose due to the extra detail , so nowadays it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucker for HGs because of the clean look . <p> Just keep in mind that in the HGUC Sinanju , all the gold trim is achieved by stickers - pretty much the only downside . <p> This maybe a bit late , High great is great , easy to build , and fun to play with it , its sturdy too , if you have experience with barbatos , its no problem with you to start RG , but it needs more patient and a bit gentle to handle ( having small parts and fragile frame armor ) to build it rather than HG , if you have those qualifications than buy RG . Fyi building HG Sinanju needing more patient too , those foil stickers is not for impatient heart . <p> Hello , HGUC or , rather if you mean " high grade " kits in general , are good for newbies , as they have lesser parts and are presumably less complicated to build . However , it is n't exactly accurate to say that RG 's are suitable only for pro builders . To build an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling or handling some of the parts as they can be really small and fragile . If you really love the details that RG kits have to offer and if this is n't your first time building gunpla , by all means you could give it a try ! <p> I started building gunpla from RG . Sure , there were so many mistakes ( nubs etc ) , but that was one of the best experiences in my life . Hence , do n't bother to much about where you should start from . If you want to build an RG , just do it . <p> I also built an RG as my first gunpla ( the RG QanT ) and it was fun but challenging . I cant say whether the RG Sinanju is good for beginners because i have n't built mine yet but i 'll know once i build it .

We had been dealing with issues on our emails servers for the past few month , which is where we store our emails . <p> The email issue had recently been fixed , however , there were some emails sent from customers which we may not have received during the time the service was down . Therefore , we now have a significant backlog of emails to respond to , which we are currently doing our best to get to them all . <p> Once again , we offer our sincerest apologies . If you have not receive a response from us at this time , you may email us again at info@gginfinite.com , and we will reply to your email in the coming week . Another option , to get a faster response from us , is to private message us at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 35 comments : <p> I think this is pretty crazy that GG Infinite had a big issue like this that lasted for months . I mean something this bad lasting even a week would be very bad , but it lasted months . <p> Although it 's pretty bad that something like this happened , I think it 's good that GG is trying to make the best of it and offering a sincere apology . I 've personally encountered ( not only through my suiton name ) many people that have vented and discussed about their distaste and disappointment with GG as of late . <p> And I get that people would 've been furious . But this is a business and often technology can be a blessing and it can on those rare instances be a hindrance . I 'm hoping that since this email issue is resolved that GG Infinite can quickly turn around and contact those who have sent in questions about orders . <p> People have to realize that things like this happen , and when it does , most people would want like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened since I do n't work at GG Infinite , but things probably came up . I highly doubt that GG was just ignoring everyone . I 'm pretty sure that he had good intentions and was trying his best to quickly resolve this issue and resume business as usual . <p> Unfortunately , this instance has upset many people and they 've told me via emails , chats , etc that I should stay away from GG Infinite because of bad customer service ( supposed ) , and that this incident was proof . I just tell people that it 's their hard earned money and they can choose where to give their business to , and if that happens to be GG Infinite , then that 's good . If not , then that 's good as well since it 's their money . <p> Personally , I 'll continue to support GG Infinite regardless of this unfortunate event . I 'm hoping that people can overlook this since you have to admit that GG is pretty much the biggest company that deals with GunPla for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , eBay , etc . <p> At the very least , he 's apologizing for this and I 'm sure that they 'll do something in the near future to compensate for this unfortunate incident . It 's just part of doing retail business . Things happen . <p> I 've had multiple jobs in the past where I worked retail and the whole mentality of the customer always being right is quite incomplete . Most of the time , customers do n't realize the back end of things on why things happen and use blind rage to vent their disappointment for a service not being given as expected , and this in turn leaves a very bad scar on the company 's reputation . <p> I 've personally dealt with many , many upset customers because the store ran out of a certain product , they could n't return something , another employee or a manager treated them bad , etc . <p> We 're all human , and humans are bound to make mistakes . The important thing is that we calmly assess the situation and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If people take this situation and really decide to stop supporting GG Infinite , what do we have ? We have pretty much nothing but import sites , or trying to find out favorite kits on eBay or Amazon ... where prices are often overpriced . Sure there are other GunPla retailers online , but none of them really have as extensive offering of products . <p> I know that I went on quite a bit . But my point is that things happen , and you have to learn to accept that these situations can happen and that it 's more important to think about why it happened instead of just raging about it . <p> I 'm giving GG another chance . I 'll keep supporting them . I hope you do the same too . <p> Hobby Link Japan has a massive selection of merchandise that costs what you 'd pay in Japan . GG is great for finding online exclusives though . Anyway , suiton proves , yet again , that he does n't know anything . <p> @Anonymous September 26 , 2013 at 4:39 PMWell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public apology was necessary . Not many companies will do this and simply email the customers when they 're ready to email them . GG is taking responsibility in being a good business and letting people know ; albeit a little bit late ( ehehe ) . <p> I 've never really had any issues with GG but a lot of people told me that they 're not mad and canceled their orders . Some told me that they canceled their order and received their money back immediately . That seems to have made them more mad for some reason . LOL <p> Again , I just tell people it 's their money so they can choose where to spend it , when to spend , and how much . <p> Personally , I think it 's better to support companies like GG Infinite . It gives small businesses ( well relative to huge companies like Amazon ) profits , and those profits will spur the economy . That 's good . A lot of people , for example , want GunPla , but they just do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , customs , etc . So even if GG 's prices are a little bit more expensive than the Yen price being offered in like Japanese based stores , I think it 's better since it 's domestic orders , helping small businesses which is what actually boosts a country 's economy ( not the greedy bastard companies ) , and overall I like GG himself . He 's a really cool guy to me and I like the company . <p> u could have tried contacted GG in Facebook , n yet since problem solved , rather leave it in past n email GG again , n its not necessary to listen to some ppl who literally nvr did anything in particular n yet suddenly pop up <p> @ Anonymous September 26 , 2013 at 4:54 PMYou can think what you want . Say what you want . But judging by this comment , I conclude a few things ( based on assumption from the comment you wrote ) . <p> a. you 're another one of those typical trolls that stalk me like a fag muffinb. you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and or have way too much timec. you most likely do n't even buy from gg infinited. you keep telling yourself to continue your journey of being the best keyboard warrior you can be <p> as for your long reply to GG , I suggest you should e-mail or pm GG privately , not openly on this thread . somehow I feel you 're a bit show-off with that reply . : ) but that 's just me , I might be wrong thou .. <p> And now suiton is back again , nope , he never left . You 're now using your account again instead of going anonymous . ( By the way , whether you comment anonymous or not , you 're still recognizable , you 're really a very predictable person ) . Not only you , suiton , is back , you 're more egomaniac than before , now acting as unofficial PR and official asskisser of GG.Anon522 is wrong that you 're a BIT show-off with your reply , you 're really a BIG show-off . <p> suiton , you write an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else has too much time ? I guess not building kits you 've bought gives you tons of time to write love letters on a blog . <p> GG is n't the biggest vendor of Gunpla based on their order number compared to other retailers . Quit spouting bullshit without having hard data and then padding it with several paragraphs of the same message in a different manner . <p> This is a severe issue that lasted months . Email servers going down for a few days is a disaster for any web based business but months ? I 'm glad they were able to respond to my complaint email about a VERY delayed order , in fact within hours , but there have been dozens of complaints about an email outage . Enough to warrant having to apologize for an inability to repair a crucial web based company needs to function and still with a backlog to get through . <p> By the way do n't spout spurring the economy " facts " since money spent on other small gunpla retailers is the same as spending it at GG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Plus people who order from overseas get their orders faster than domestic who have to wait on their Japanese stop and for cheaper . Orders from Amiami and HLJ are cheaper to buy and ship and will get to the US weeks before US Retailers and that 's a fact . <p> I 'll get my MG Strike Rouge Phoenix and will get here next week at $13 cheaper . Stop . Spouting . Bullshit . <p> In all seriousness Shiton , from you huge-ass post i can conclude a few things as well ( i guess i 'll just take up your formatting , since it 'll probably be easier for you ) : <p> a ) You seem like you have quite some time on your hands as well if you go to the trouble of writing down something that could pass for an essay ( in addiction to posting on you blog ) . b ) You 're doing a hell of a PR service for a company you do n't work for ( aka , you 're fishing for freebies ) c ) Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all i 've seen is people slightly complain that they have been having issues with GG , not properly a pitchfork-and-torch angry mob ( alas , nice exaggeration ) d ) Take the idea off your tiny brain that you have " haters " that are constantly " trolling " you . We do n't troll you , we just really feel you 're THAT damn obnoxious and it 's extra-taxing that we have to put up with your incessant crap EVERYWHERE.e ) You do n't know what the hell you 're talking about when it comes to retail so , kindly , do n't make a bigger fool of yourself.f ) The only point you 're right about is - we 'll spend our money wherever we damn want - Thank you , Captain Obvious , for clarifying that to us weaker-minded plebeians . <p> That said - please go back to whatever cave you came from Shiton , no one asked for your uninformed opinion that brought absolutely nothing to this discussion . <p> GG , thank you for your honesty , but if the issue were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my frankness with the individual cited previously . <p> Emphasis on Anon803 's letter D on his comment . As for you , suiton629 , a.k.a . Charles Kim , are you a celebrity who have issues with " bashers " . WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE to believe that we are spending time to troll you just for fun . In fact , your bullshit comments are really wasting our time . We are replying to you so that you 'll understand the damage you have done and leave or even apologize and repent if you want . There may be others who criticize you so you 'll get a hold of yourself and do good things from now on . <p> Oh boy , this was brought to my attention , and what can I say ? My dear suiton . You are are an hypocrite and an ass kisser . You were the one who posted on your blog that GG was a liar and a traitor and he would n't get anything else from you : Unfortunately you deleted that post , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was a mistake , then you shout do as you 're spouting about here , and ask for an apology . Do n't say I 'm a liar , because many many ppl saw that post , I even linked to it on FB ( that sure got a laugh from ppl ) . You also posted pics complaining about a box you received that was mishandled . You are also the one who admitted that you bought something from someone on ebay , and since it took a little bit longer , you reported the seller , but ended up getting the goods anyway , and you seemed proud about what you did . You also posted this ; <p> Which is you doing exactly what you slag costumers for doing on your post here . <p> This was a severe issue , and that 's why GG addressed it , as he should . Do n't try for one minute to sugar coat it . The only thing you 're doing here is ass kissing . I 'm positive that you asked him time and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have laughed his ass off , and then politely ignored or refused you . <p> You are one of the biggest liars ever on this community ( still waiting for proof of your built kits , you irc channel , your private forum , all these friends you talk to , I 'm sure one of them could publicly vouch for . All of these friends who somehow did n't enter your contest , btw . Also , you lied about leaving social networking , which later was just YT , since you never left , you still commented under suiton username and admitted on your public blog that you were hiding under a different username . That 's not being on a hiatus , that 's being a coward ) . You are a sneaky presumptuous troll who , instead of manning up and facing ppl , goes around their back PMing ppl on YT for them to block ppl who so much as say anything that remotely offends poor suiton ( all those ppl were my friends , btw , and they all told me you PMed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) . You make endless lists on your blog revealing a huge ass list of all the blocked ppl on your channel . That 's like these so called butthurt costumers you refer to here . You make a list of the ppl who hate you , and publish it , and you actually look proud of it ! Pretty much all of these ppl have just one person on their blocked list on YT . Guess who ? ( hint : it 's you ) . Could 70+ ppl actually be all of them wrong about you . Or perhaps , just perhaps , you 're the one who 's actually in the wrong . <p> After all of this I just said , you have the nerve to come here and preach about the virtues of being a good costumer , of letting this very serious problem just slide cuz you feel like kissing GG 's ass ? What moral do you have ? Who the fuck are you to spout and preach ? <p> Now , you can do as much ad hominem attacks as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wo n't change the truth of what I posted here . If you can assume a persons life from a simple 4 word comment , I can very well legitimately assume all I want from your posts here and everywhere . Not that I do , cuz all I say is verifiable truth , and everyone , you included , of course , knows it 's true . <p> I remember WeAreBenWeAreMany 's past comment that suiton , in his own blog , bashes GG Infinite , swears he will not order from them anymore and encourages the readers of his blog to do the same . Days later , he deleted his anti-GGI post in his blog and days later , posted his Tatsu Hobby issue . Good thing you mentioned it in the beginning of your comment . <p> We should add that suiton 's excuse not to buy internationally is another lie . This was posted by him on hobbylinkTV:suiton629 posted an update 3 months ago <p> @scott Thank you so much for accepting my friend request . I 'm pretty sure that you might remember me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to importing and the customs concerns I had . And definitely Syd and Ryan both recognize me as does most people in the GunPla community . =D Thank you for having such an amazing company . I love what you guys do . I wish I could confidently import from you guys since your prices are phenomenal . I still also hope you guys get those P-Bandai online exclusive kits for sale on your online store . Ive been getting those online exclusives through GG Infinite , which I love quite extensively . =D <p> Im surprised to see sution back on here . Now the people will be further disappointed with GG now that we have too deal with him . Suiton you do n't have the slightest grasp of why people are upset with GG . GG is offering a service too people but you do n't understand how frustrating it is to do business with someone and you are unable to communicate with . It makes you feel as if you been scammed . Personally I 'm disappointed with GG because I placed a order with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I check my account and the transaction was completed and they took payment the day I placed the order . But it was still a week before they send my order when they clammed orders are shipped within 2 business days and I payed for express shipping . Their email issues have very little to do with shipping . If you can except payment you can ship a order with in a specified time since the transaction was completed . If GG would have to send me a personal email before I would feel their apology is sincere . This feel more like sorry we could n't recieve.you emails so quit whining about it . And as for you sution you are the last person in the world that should play PR guy . You are probably one of the most despised people on the internet . If someone like vegeta8259 or justinius build posted a what you said maybe people would be excepting to GG apology but all you did was add full to the fire . <p> glad to hear that , hope GG wont lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n pls c throughly about who is the real supporter , internet is complicated , n hope all mails get sorted as soon to continue business , n to any1 who is eager to get instant message , u could try on the Facebook to contact GG , n yes juz blindly stating <p> I 've only done business with GG once about a year ago and after that , I told myself that it would be the first and last . It was about the exact same issue , poor communication . After sending many emails through their customer service email address , no respond whatsoever . The only way that I got a hold of them was sending private message to their Facebook account . I got a respond saying they were on it and waiting for the item to ship in their warehouse , but it was way pass the month they promise the pre-order would come in , there was no communication to the customers nor any post on their store website or this website saying the pre-order would be delayed . GG said they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need a quick respond , please send a message to Facebook account.GG , seriously ? ! What is the point of having a customer service email if you do not check them often and wanting people to reach you through Facebook message for a quicker and direct response ? This issue was already there a year ago and I am surprised that it is still occurring today . People need a quicker responds should be through your customer service not your Facebook account ! Your team , GG should check the customer service email way more often then your Facebook from now on . If not , take that email out of the website and have all customers send private message directly to Facebook . It just does n't make sense to me at all . We need to be able to contact and reach to your staff at our convenience not other way around ! ! GG I hope you read this and get it right this time . <p> I shop with GG quite a bit . never had any issue . yeah they tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get loads of emails . Probably more than they can handle . Kudos for being upfront and dealing with the bad press GG . You still got my support .

@@35099512 @4099512/ <h> Monday , March 4 , 2013 <h> MG 1/100 MSN-06S Sinanju Stein - Review by Team GG Falldog <p> Note - For this review I refer to the design/kit as either the " Sinanju Stein " or just " Stein . " Whenever I refer to the " Sinanju " by itself I 'm referring to the original Sinanju design/kit . <p> Refinement . That 's the first word that pops into my head when thinking about Bandais latest kit , the Master Grade Sinanju Stein . More specifically , a lack of refinement . Hear me out . <p> Most Universal Century mobile suits tend to have a design lineage . Each new generation incorporates elements from the one before it in an ever evolving family tree . Its part of the charm . It should be no surprise to many that the Stein servers as a linkage between the suits of 0093 ( Nu Gundam , Sazabi ) and those of 0096 ( Unicorn Gundam , Sinanju ) . The issue is that the Stein is n't a natural relative , but one forced into the center . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply bridge that gap ( not that it was particularly needed ) or to help sell merchandise , but the design feels like an unnatural hodgepodge of four separate suits . Beautiful curves here , beautiful angles there , when all together the design feels forced . <p> This lack of refinement also carries over to the kit itself . At its core is the old Sinanju Ver.Ka , easily one of the best Master Grade kits Bandai ever released . The Stein is built so heavily on its older cousin ( or rather , older son ) that , in classic Bandai style , it comes with a whole bunch of unused parts that wouldve gone into the MG Sinanju ( roughly 26 ) . Internally its pretty much the same kit aside from different pieces here and there as needed to adjust for changes to the exterior . What annoys me is that in some areas Bandai really half assed these updates . Take the yellow thruster trim detail seen on the MG Sinanju . They were all individual pieces which added to the complexity and detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which really should have been separate pieces , are just built into the main armor piece . Granted , this does n't  really hurt the look of the kit since they 're all white , but it creates unnecessary difficulty for those looking to apply custom paint jobs . Its almost an insult that they removed detail from a kit that 's essentially a re-release and costs the same amount of money . <p> Continuing with my design rant there are a few bits that are straight off the Sinanju which are n't  needed on the Stein , like the loop on the lower back where the old pipes would have gone . Or the rear-waist bazooka attachment point that 's still better suited for Sinanjus rifle . As best as I can tell the rifle was adjusted to fit the existing attachment point rather than the otherway around . <p> The updated armor pieces are n't  very refined very well from a kit engineering prospective either . There are a handful of odd gaps that pop up here and there and other pieces that do n't  quite flow into others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one large piece when it shouldve been two . The only reason I can think for designing it as one piece is to cut costs . The same goes for the chest vents and external leg thrusters . They 're one piece when it shouldve been made up of an inner piece with a separate outer-trim component . There 's also a lot to be desired about the Steins backpack . Where the Sinanjus was a beefy masterpiece of thrust , Steins has a lot of open components that seem out of place with the rest of the kit . On the plus side this means that all of the thrusters and accent pieces can move around in all sorts of directions . On the downside this unnecessary articulation means all of the components move around so much that its almost hard to pose properly ( getting everything into place without accidentally pushing on something else ) . They also have tendency to pop out thanks to the lack of poly-cap joints . At the very least they 're the only part of the kit I had trouble with parts staying attached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinge if you push them in too far but that 's something easy to avoid . <p> Last but not least for my ranting , Bandais new MG hands . Stein features the same sonic-welded hands first debuted on the MG Nu Ver.Ka . They may be fully articulated but I think they stink in comparison to the fully articulated hands seen on older MG kits ( like the Sinanju or Dom ) . When a part comes off , most commonly a fingertip , they 're unlikely to go back on and stay on . This makes them a pain to work on when you 're constantly worried about messing them up . My MG Nu Ver.Ka. is missing two fingertips and Stein currently three . To Bandais credit they negated the extra wrist joint ( used on the Nu to allow it to properly wield its bazooka ) by making the hand armor piece extend on the back and lock it into place . <p> The one good thing about these hands is that they feature a flip out piece to attach a weapon , which also has an interlocking piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Steins large rifle without it falling out . <p> Now then , enough ranting . No , really . Its time to talk about all the good things this kit has to offer . Yes , there are some . <p> As Stein shares the same inner frame elements as the Sinanju , Stein is incredibly sturdy . For a kit lacking poly-cap joints it does a fantastic job of standing firm and holding tight . If I hold the kit horizontally by the torso the legs do n't  budge a bit . Unlike the Sinanju , Stein is able to wield the shield without any issues . ( Side note - While the shield looks like the Nus it does n't  have the same flexibility as the Nu Ver.Ka . It can just spin around and lacks the ability to tilt in different directions ) Not surprisingly , the same does n't  apply to the massive rifle . The arm holds without problem , but the wrist joint sags . This can be somewhat mitigated by positioning the arm so that the hand rests against the large forearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up by itself ( here 's looking at you , 00 and AGE designs ) . <p> Articulation is pretty strong with few limitations . <p> Steins rifle is quite impressive , as is the excellent looking bazooka which I 'm pretty sure is the same one used by the Sinanju throughout Gundam Unicorn . Much like the Sinanju the Stein can wield her beam sabers from the forearm . <p> Stein comes with a nice set of waterslide decals with a few stickers , namely the eyes and a sticker to make the chin white . <p> One appealing element to this kit is that its largely white and light grays . Folks looking to have some fun with their paint job and do vibrant colours do n't  have to spend a lot of time priming . I do n't  think Im going to go too fabulous when I paint but I already have some fun ideas in mind . <p> In the end , I really wanted to like the Sinanju Stein . It has an interesting look , construction went really smoothly , but it kept fighting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated I got . Maybe its just one of those days but pieces kept coming off ( almost lost a few key parts of the left hand ) or I could n't get things to sit just right . Part of it is because I just finished the newer and excelent Nu Ver.Ka but its hard for me to positively compare it to any other Ver.Ka kits . Which makes it even harder to recommend . Regardless of what I say it comes down to whether you like the design or not . If so , then get the kit and have fun . Otherwise I suggest keeping things classic and getting the Sinanju Ver.Ka or the upcoming OVA version instead . <p> First time you mentioned this " forum " you said you had 750 members ....

A boy Hi-Nu Gundam meets a girl Nightingale and they had a baby Unicorn . =D <p> Have to disagree with the complaints about the design .

" Although the complaint did not specifically name Mobile Suit Gundam : Iron-Blooded Orphans as the series in question , but the scene described in the complaint does seem like what was shown in one of the episode in the series . <p> It is to be noted that viewers were warned of the mature contents in the series at website such as Hulu.com .

Preferably the latter , since the people complaining obviously do n't have the mental capacity to deal with fantasy . Wonder how they deal with real life ? <p> eh they actually protested to this ? i thought many animes are even more " violent " . what about death note , where the protagonist is a homicidal god complex who kills everyone ? what about berserk with all the blood gore and nudity ? <p> Before this shit even came out it was said that this shit would be a dramatic series and any parents out there should of looked into it more before letting their kids view it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled anime out there anyway.Bunch of morons . <p> As if Highschoold DxD is the softest thing for children content-wise.As if Umaru-chan is the best example to be a person.As if Love Live is the best example of child labor .

The kids being shot early on , the executions , and Crank 's death . I appreciated that they actually followed through with the " orphan mercenary " thing with them actually doing the types of unpleasant things you might expect people in those circumstances to do . <p> But let 's get real here .

Even if it does n't exist on mars , I 'd still be pretty upset as a parent showing this to a 10-12 year old without any kind of warning it would be happening . <p> Sure , we have n't seen a main kill off dudes like Mikazuki here but look as far recent as 00 and Destiny .

The Ghost in the Shell manga has a lesbian cyborg orgy and Akira has rape and sex slaves , but they were published in seinen magazines instead of shonen ones . <p> Valvrave is a better comparison because it 's the same demographic but I think it did get some flack over it too . <p> But it 's also an exaggeration to think that this is a controversy .

Although the Bandai kits ARE superior in any way ( plastic quality and the engineering - wise ) the bootlegs had to step up their game as well to somehow get the competitive edge like adding extra parts that is not available with the Bandai counterparts like the MG Shenlong 's Liaoya sword that came along as an extra in a Hongli kit ( some special edition kit ) and now this one from DM . Technically TGIII is just a glorified TGI and the people at DM were creative enough to mash up 3 kits to come up with this product , naming the MG TGI ( base kit ) , HG TGIII ( head , shoulder armor &amp; armaments ) and MG Epiyon ( for the heat Rod ) . I was planning on bashing those 3 kits myself , but now that I discovered that a bootleg exists for the TGIII , I do n't have to spend extra cash for all 3 kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapskate , but not many people have that amount of money laying around the house , do n't get me wrong , I do support Bandai since all my Gundam kits are from Bandai . But with this kit I think I can make an exception , it 's because it can save me a lot of time and money , rather than buying 3 Bandai kits , I can just buy the TGIII bootleg and get hop up parts and transplant them to the OG TGI kit . As far as the legal battle goes between Bandai and these bootleggers , none of the bootleggers were granted any license by Bandai to produce these kits . <p> This is what I find to be amazing . NO ONE has every made any complaints about resin kits made by other companies , yet they 're perfectly fine &amp; accepted by all but not bashed like how u all r doing so w/this kit ...

I 'm sure that 's something we all can agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they practically created the hobby . Without Bandai there is no Gunpla and none of these bootlegs will ever exist .

Imagine how would that make you feel ? Plus , I 'm sad to inform you that Gundam Wing only made it big outside of Japan , because it was the very first Gundam series that sort of got a good PR before it came out . In Japan however , Gundam Wing flopped so bad that Bandai did n't even bothered to create 1/100 HG versions of two of the main MS suits of the series , naming the Heavy Arms and the Sand Rock . That is how bad GW flopped in Japan .

Have you visited the official Bandai Hobby site ? It 's purely in Japanese , which means that only people who can read and understand Japanese can buy stuff from there . And what does that mean for the rest of us who ca n't understand a speck of Japanese ? You figure it out . My point is , Bandai 's Gunpla production cycle depends on their market in Japan . Of course they would eventually release main MS from other Gundam series every now and then as a sort of homage to the series , but that 's all we 'll ever get . <p> Bandai already released ng 1/100 tallgeese 3 .

Bootleg or not both of them are still model kits and its up to the users itself to support bootleg kits or support Bandai 's .

And that is because the Base Jabber is just a lot of large parts coming together . Nothing too complex here , and when compare to all the details that the FA Unicorn Gundam has , the Base Jabber is more like an afterthought .

And talking about Patlabor , majority of SRW fans are really hyped about this because Patlabor is one of the most wanted title to be appeared in SRW games . Basically Banpresto is using the same pattern in UX that adding title that fans longing to appear and a title that totally unexpected to be appeared.though now I wonder how Banpresto will pull the storyline in this game ...

Its main armaments are a pair of beam cannons , with a beam gun attached to the right shoulder armor for med-to-close range combat . Other weapons include a pair of head head-mounted vulcan guns and a beam rifle , with a grenade launcher mounted under the barrel . A noticeable weakness of the Detector is its lack of any sort of melee weapons , putting it at a disadvantage in close combat . <p> History : The Guncannon Detector was also developed for Karaba as an artillery mobile suit suitable for use in guerilla combat , the MSA-005K uses the same frame as the original Methuss . It is able to take a shooting position in an instant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . While one machine was destroyed in a failed landing attempt , the other was safely collected by Karaba . It was painted with a red color scheme and called Guncannon Detector by Hayato Kobayashi . <p> In UC 0096 , a Guncannon Detector was deployed by the Earth Federation during the assault of Torrington Base , where it disabled multiple Zeon MS carrier units . The Guncannon Detector was evenutally destroyed by a squad of the Zeon remnant forces . <p> Armaments:30mm Vulcan Gun <p> These shell firing weapons have a high-rate of fire but have little power and ca n't damage the thick armor of a mobile suit , though it can damage lightly armored areas such as the sensors . The weapons are ideal for shooting down small , fast moving , lightly armored targets such as missiles , small land vehicles , and attack helicopters . <p> Beam Gun <p> Mounted on the right shoulder armor and intended to function as a med-to close range weapon .

Capable of firing concentrated mega particles , attacks from a beam rifle are can damage any ordinary armor that has not be specially treated to resist it . When the technology became available it became standard for beam rifles to be powered by rechargeable energy caps that can be replaced mid-battle if they run out of power . <p> Grenade Launcher <p> One grenade launcher is attached below the barrel of the beam rifle . <p> Beam Cannon <p> Mounted over the Detector 's shoulders , these weapons are extremely powerful with one shot being enough to destroy a mobile suit . They also have an unusually high rate of fire due to a pair of cooling vents on the back of the mobile suit which keep the cannons from overheating .

RM ? Seed RM is over for quite a while now , not to mention Destiny RM . I do n't see how they could still capitalize on a MG Freedom.Xi ver.Ka ? Seriously ? I realised there 's Robot Damashii and SD out for this in the recent years but I do n't think Xi has receive that much recognition yet among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prove us wrong that Bandai is willing to make a complex golden plated MG , but I still do n't think this is cost effective for them to produce , unless they want to do Build Akatsuki.Blast Impulse ? Not a chance.Gundam ver.Ka Ver 2.0 ? WTH ? With the ver 3.0 , why would they even make a ver 2.0 of an older design ? Lotto ? Now you 're just being funny . <p> I think the another rx78-2 is a little too early . I think with the 3.0 frame , if they do n't make a MG GM-kai ( or any GM ) they are missing out on a huge opportunity . With a standardized GM frame , think of the variant possibilities , especially making the backpack attachment standardized . I 'd shell out a couple hundred dollars for a grunt army , or at least a sniper squad ... looking at you MG sniper ii *wink* <p> HGUC Gundam MK-II do u mean the FA version or the mk 3 XDalso the rg u posted like the gm , ground gundam , gouf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the line art they showed us at the model event with the ez8 was prototyped . also a lot of the thing I saw u posted I am like yes make them please along . with these as hg cq2 from age , tarus , leos , virgo , and ect I had more cant rember : P <p> @MaddSazabi and The O do n't have binder which to be number one problem for Kshatriya to be released as MG . Sure die-cast parts for connector arms is the solution , but it will make the cost high , maybe more expensive than MG Sazabi and The O. <p> What if they released a pg unicorn . FUUUCK . It would cost as much the oo gundam . But i 'd still buy . OHHHHH YEAH . And it would be cool if they did a pre order gift where all pre orders come with green psychoframe runners . <p> if they were to make mg amazing kampfer , i really hope they would make mg kampfer 2.0 as well . old mg kampfer is ugly . i picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also because the hg looks better . <p> OO MG has no more to deal with , i think . There 's no more details necessary for those harute or zabanya . Anyway , I prefer any from UC series for PG ( easier LED build ) , V2 KA . is ok , strike rougue for RG , and crossbone for HG , cuz i think crossbone part will do a lot with customizing <p> Zabanya and harute really needs a last battle version . I do n't care if it 's in hg or mg ( &lt;most wanted ) , but bandai should at least make a expansion pack for hg 's . I wanted to make a final version zabanya and tried to buy 7 of it but .... how much is that ? 250$ ? ? <p> I 'm liking the amount of Victory here . The V2 's been begging for a MG release since the V1 came out , and I , limiting my fanboy-ing to about 20% , would like to say that this thing would be THE GREATEST RELEASE EVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bad . Sure , it had minor stability issues and a lack of mobility in the chest and waist , but the legs and arms had really good mobility . I am so friggin ' excited about the chances of a MG V2.And yes , I know that this list is just a prediction , but the chances for it is really good . Quite frankly , I would feel stupid if I get this excited and nothing happens.And you have my thoughts .... Oh , hey there were other things on the list . Uhm ...... RG Unicorn would be amazing ? <p> I have built the MG Freedom and i can agree with you that it is a good kit , its sturdy and looks nice , but to me and my honest opinion , the kit could be better in terms of details , better aesthetics and it would look up to date with the MG Aile Strike Ver . RM and Strike Rouge Ootori Ver . RM <p> Freedom should get a shot at a remaster to finish off the line , Jesta Cannon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unicorn finishing up . Real grade might b IJ most of the latter portion of 2014 will probably be Origin kits , hoping for Bandai to finish off the Wing EW line . <p> I think that this year we will see some great kits , and i honestly think there is a good chance we could see jegan , geara zulu and a Hyaku Shiki ver 2.0 in MG form . but in terms of kits i 'd like to get in MG form would be the freedom gundam ( ver rm/Ka ) justice , savior , Kshatriya and also Jagd doga. maybe for december we could get an updated Re-GZ , but i 'd much rather have a Kshatriya. in terms of exclusives , i think we could possible see re-colors of the the Ver 3.0 gundam , geara doga ( sleeves or full frontal ver ) the aile strike ver rm ( maybe add onto it with striker packs ) and maybe and ill go out on a limb and say this but maybe a mg exia RIII because they came out with in in metal build &amp; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following is almost a given for 2014 release , Gundam X moah , Gundam Wing Fenice , Banshee Norn , Jesta Cannon and X Divider . Any other kits you think could pop out ? <p> The complete EW Gundams need to be released , we already have two Sandrock barely changed , and I do n't think they 'll need a dramatically different inner frame for Heavyarms and Nataku . A RG Wing Zero Custom would also be completely amazing ! <p> MG Freedom RM , Justice and Providence : if they were to make it , it would 've happened already or been announced right now ; it 's a little late for that . In fact , Blast Impluse has a better chance than those . <p> Xi Gundam , is n't that supposed to be bigger that Kshatriya ? About as likely as Destroy Gundam in model form . <p> Also , with Gundam 3.0 recently released mean at least 3-5 years before they consider a new mood . <p> They really need to release the HGUC Gaza-D and Capule in both the Unicorn and ZZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeon MS from ZZ and Unicorn save these two . Considering how wonderfully accurate the HGUC Gaza-C 's transformation was , I can not imagine how awesome a HGUC Gaza-D would be . <p> But anything that require minor change to existing kit molds or only a few more additional runners ( e.g. Unicorn variants , etc. ) would likely be more probable . <p> Would love to see new brand new PG kit too , but income/economy for the intended costumer demographic might not have recovered sufficiently to justify the **31;369;TOOLONG expenses . Hence we will likely continue to see the likes of PG Astray Blue Frame released , if at all ... <p> MG V2 Ver . Ka would be so flipping nice along with the DX . It would complete the MG Lead Gundam collection of the 90s ( If you 're not one of those people who do n't accept the Wing Zero Proto as the closest we 're going to get to a MG Wing Zero TV version ) . All we 're missing then is the AGE-3 and AGE-FX which I doubt will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening more than I can those two machines ... but I can still wish for it . V2 and DX seem very likely to me . MG Banshee Norm goes without saying ... <p> MG Xi ... at first I hated the Xi ... I thought it was an oversized bulky monstrosity piloted by one of my least favorite characters from CCA . But over the past year I 've grown to accept it and even develop a fondness for it . So if they did do a MG Xi ... which I doubt ... you would not see a complaint from me . <p> Other than that this entire list seems to be trolling me . MG Justice ? I would kill for that but I bet the sun will go super nova before we can see that thing . Freedom RM ? As much as I love the Freedom I ca n't see it since the original MG is still fine in my opinion and the window may have closed for it since the SEED Destiny RM is wrapping up . MG Providence , Legend , Gundam Ver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see three happening that ARE N'T on this list ... they are the X Maoh , Wing Fenice , and MAYBE ... MAYBE Full Armor Unicorn OVA Ver . Another three I can possibly see as Premium Bandai include X-0 Ghost , V2 Assault Buster Parts ( Assuming V2 Ver . Ka gets announced ) , and maybe the black recolor of the Gundam X from Under the Moonlight ... <p> And just to throw out a wacky never going to happen one but I would lmao if they did ... MG Perfect Gold Frame Amatsu ... make it happen Bandai ... make it happen ! <p> A MG V2 ver KA will be a great kit to follow up with the previous MG Victory , but the question will still be : Has Bandai perfected the transformation+combine sequence of the V2 ? Will it hold up to the Buster-Assault add on parts like the Full Armor Unicorn ? <p> A MG Delta Kai ver KA is possible likely with the ongoing popularity of the " Across the Sky " manga and the use of the MG Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bandai 's hand and you know they are always keeping you waiting and testing your patience ... <p> A MG Banshee Norn and MG Jesta Cannon are sure things with the conclusion of the Unicorn OVA saga . So it is quite predictable to see them getting MG treatment . I 'm not so sure on the possibility of a MG Lotto , which should have appeared much more earlier 3 years ago . Obviously , the Lotto is n't as popular as other UC kits and I think we should blame it onto the fanboys who are too obsessed with Marida Cruz 's boobs ... <p> The Gundam Origin anime at the moment is still very much in the dark and there is a possibility that they might change the designs to connect with the current younger generation . Therefore I do n't think MG release based on the Origin title will be so soon or it might not happen at all judging by the Thunderbolt release title . <p> Speaking of a MG Gerbera Tetra , what about the GP04 Gerbera as MG too ? Then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GP02A and GP03S . I guess you would have to wait for the GP01+FB to be refined and reissued as a MG VER 3.0 to make that happen . <p> And it 's really funny that no one here talks about a possible release of a MG GM Sniper 2 , which can be developed from the frameworks of the MG Nemo . <p> I also think it is high time that the other 3 Gundams ( SnowWhite , Warlock , Scheherazade ) to be unveiled to the Endless Waltz and Frozen Teardrop followers . What more , Patlabor live action movie is scheduled to be aired next year and I think MG Patlabors might be back again , hopefully with a truck carrier release too ... <p> A lot of kits were promised before by Bandai and never saw the light of day . I 'd like to see the MG Age-3 ( Normal , Orbital , Fortress ) and MG Age-FX ( and FX Burst ) along with at least the MG Age-1 Full Gransa , but we never know til Bandai makes an announcement . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colors at the 2009 GunPla Expo show . It has never come out . But maybe we 'll actually get it along with MG Exia Repair 3 since there 's a Metal Build for Repair 3 and MG Exia Repair 2 is coming in 2014 ( February I think ) . <p> Other kits we never got were like HG Flag ( Setusuna ver ) and the HG Seravee II ( the hat pack for Raphael ) . <p> Vayeate and Mercurius as MGs would be badass , but I think Bandai would take the ' lazy ' and ' cost effective ' route and just do a MG Tallgeese III instead to appease the majority of the fans of MG Wing kits . <p> I do n't think that is possible , not even a VIRGO , ARIES or TAURUS get a MG treatment . HG might be more possible and as usual , you can blame it all on otakus who are too obsessed with eye candies and GAY boys from 00 <p> With the HG Doven Wolves and Silver Bullets I think the Geymalk would stand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its funnels were on Star Build Strike 's box , a tiny step closer XD <p> For real though , it 's safe to say that the Gunpla displayed in Iori 's store are all part of the All Gundam Project . The Crossbone is to be expected . The Turn-X , although not a Gundam , being the only non-Gundam on the shelf means Turn-A is getting a friend soon . Also at the CM after each episode there is Strike Freedom and Stargazer coming after Strike , so HGCE is gon na replace the Seed Remaster line . <p> I would like to have the MG Gundam Delta Kai , I 've been waiting for that gundam to be produce as MG. the xi gundam would also be nice , not to mention RG unicorn .. I hope my wish do come true . To bandai , please do release my wish list . thank you . <p> any MG zeon suits are fine by me : ) oh yeah ... MG AGE 3 's are nice too and Legilis Gundam ? perhaps ? but seriously .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is of the sleeves .. MG kshatryia pleaseeeeee <p> I do ! ! And there was like 2-3 kits ( MGs which are my only concern ) that was right on .. i do n't know about an MG V2 but the MG Victory gundam is n't that good is it ? ( based on the reviews I 've seen so far ) but based on this prediction MG geara zulu is probably the one ban dai goes with just because they can release another color ver . of it ( angelo 's ) .. but freedom ver RM ? Seriously ? Please do n't ... there 's too much seed already ... and MG Banshee Norn is undoubtedly having its release this year along with MG Jesta cannon .. I 'm gon na be soo fucking broke this year .. <p> And Wing proto Zero &amp; Sinanju stein come from nowhere , that thing was unpredictable . Also Phenex and turn X was really unpredictable . The only thing that easy to predict was sazabi ver ka because hint is everywhere , This year prediction is pretty same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will never happen . <p> I 'd like to see All Gundam Project really take off , if all the suits in build fighter are going to be customs of existing suits that really gives the guys creating the kits the space they need to re do the old ones . Plus they 're likely to need to do that to create bases for some of the customs in Build Fighter . They ca n't just keep picking out of HGUC.Also if I could be selfish about it I 'd really like to see a load of new Wing kits . <p> Hi , I 'm fairly new to gunpla and I 've build like 10 MGs , the first is MG AGE-1 normal .. so can someone tell me what the heck is this Xi gundam ? Like what series is it from .. ? From what I know ver . Ka is the best MG in terms of details right ? I 've built the sinanju and sazabi and they 're the best by far ... plus can someone recommend any MG on par with the sazabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel Hathaway 's Flash.Not that ver Ka 's are the best in detail , some other kits are just as detailed , but lately bandai seems to be putting a lot of effort into making ver Kas shine above other MGs , detail wise . Like you said , sinanju and sazabi are the best so far ( sazabi takes the cake ) , but you 'll proly enjoy RX-78-2 3.0 , sinanju stein , the jesta , Nu ver Ka ... 00 raiser is also an amazing MG <p> Ver . Ka is not the best overall , there have been many Ver . Ka kits that are terrible and just fall apart if you touch them ( V Gundam , V-dash , the Crossbone line , etc ) . There have been a few good Ver . Ka kits ( Nu , sinanju , sazabi ) . If you want detailed then Nu Gundam Ver . Ka and RX-78-2 3.0 are very detailed , as well as Aile Strike ver . RM . Sinanju Stein is ( in my opinion ) even better than the regular Sinanju . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate . <p> If you have n't already , I 'd get the Nu Gundam ver . Ka ( counterpart to the sazabi ) . <p> I 'd still like to know where all this debate on ver Kas being floppy messes comes from . There are about 10 ver Ka MGs ( with a few variations and add ons and exclusives ) , RX-78-2 , Wing , Ball , Crossbone , Victory and V dash , Unicorn , Sinanju , Stein , Nu and Sazabi . Of all these , only one ( well , one and half ) are actually not so great , i.e , the victory . The crossbone is a very good kit , and is based on the F91 frame , which is not a ver Ka . The one that falls apart is the Fullcloth , which is not a ver Ka either . So , saying a whole line is not the best based on a single not so successful kit is something I never understood , especially when everyone knows many kits on this list are some of the best MGs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible and provide two examples ( one is not even a good example ) and then say a few are good and provide 3 examples pretty much sums up how wrong this notion is <p> Thanks guys ... I think I 'll buy the Nu ver.Ka next .. as far as this year release goes .. I want nothing more than any MG from the Unicorn series or the sazabi series just because I 've already have the unicorn , sinanju , sazabi and jesta . <p> I admit that this is a wishlist though ( Actually , wishlists are not bad , its just a certain one who spams them that making wishlists look bad ) : PG : Nu , ZZMG : V2 , DX , Xi , Le Cgyne , Gaplant Erisia CustomRG : Nu , SazabiHG : Le Cygne , Gaplant Erisia Custom <p> this kind of thing is pretty much pointless imo. a lot of kits always had the " possibilities " , but bandai can only release so much , not to mention there are upccoming new models from GBF. also , bandai is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since mg freedom , but it never gets to be released . same can be said for mg blast impulse , but now we have mg destiny impulse , lke who the fuck would have guessed that ? <p> aside from the obvious mg banshee norn and rg exia repair ( online exclusive maybe ? ) , all of them are " possibilities " . also , i do n't see why xi gundam being released as SD BB has anything to do with its chance getting an mg. and how the hell does xamel even have a 20% chance of getting an HG ? <p> I am with you . Why has n't Bandai considered making a SINGLE hazel master grade ? They made several Advance of Zeta High grades that were well received ( and even had an additional hrududu support kit ) , it makes sense on a marketing approach to design a MG . <p> If I had a choice of which Hazel variant , I would probably go with the original TR-1 since thaere has n't been an official kit of it from Bandai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I find it strange that kits of Hazel variants ( custom , advanced , and II ) were released but the original Hazel still does n't have a kit of its own . <p> Since the Divider might come out this year , I can make room for more hope for the Delta Kai . It 'd make my year to get one&lt;3 . Tallgeese 3 as well . I 'll hold my breath until an Assault/Buster pack comes out for the V2.Akatsuki Gundam is also a must have for me . <p> It would be really interesting though , if Bandai releases MG of designs that are usually the least expected to have an MG . I mean the Unicorn Phenex was sort of out there ( given that it only appeared in G-Dome and we are not really sure how it figures in UC history because it is pretty much a God kit ) but practical for Bandai because it shares a mold with the other Unicorn units , not to mention being received well in Japan . And there 's the fact that there are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative and creative technology but are still not given the MG treatment . <p> Ideally , I would have loved Bandai to try on other designs , like the Cosmic Era version of the Zaku , for instance , or the mass production units in UC . It would have been nice to see mobile suit variations like the Nu Mass Prod ver , or the RX-F91 , or the Zaku III . There are several Zeta versions out there besides the original and the Karaba versions . And then there are the commander suits . The Stein was released , why not the Delta Kai ? Or the Delta Gundam ? Why not the Stark Jegan ? So many possibilities , too little slots available . <p> My whislist for MG : - ZZ ver 2.0 , I hope its next end year big MG- Zaku ver 3.0 , after grand daddy why not this ? - GP0-1&amp; Fb ver 2.0 , just follow RG aesthetic and ppl will throw money- Jagd Dga , considering its unique design bandai should consider it- V2 , its should be done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should considered- Xi , its baddest suit ever . I hear hathaway flash will mentioned in final Unicorn series , maybe can be happen but it will have huge setback cause its size . But after see Sazabi and ppl keep buying that big ass suit .

@@35099545 @4099545/ <h> Thursday , October 15 , 2009 <h> PSP - Gundam Vs . Gundam Next Plus ( Update 3 ) <p> Here are some updated MS info from the official PSP GVG Next Plus website ... with the ones shown here being my current favorites . I have to say I was n't that excited about this game after the release of Gundam Senki UC0081 . That game still currently rules my PS3 , and will be there for awhile ( even Batman : Arkam Asylum has to stand aside for now ) . And quite honestly , I have n't been using my PSP for gaming for a quite awhile , but just using it to watch videos on my bed ( currently rewatching Densha Otoko ..... Hermes MOE ! LOL ) <p> But as I find out more about the upcoming PSP GVG Next Plus ... I am getting more excited . The most interesting addition over the original arcade game is the " Next plus " mode , that allows the player to use a team of four Gundams to tackle a series of missions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow him to customize and improve his mobile suits . The best part , though , is that this mode will be available even as a cooperative mode , allowing 4 players to connect over the ad hoc network and play the missions together . <p> And there is a couple of updated controls for the Next Plus version : <p> Shield block : by pressing down on the D pad only Mobile suits equipped with a shield will be able to block the incoming attacks with it . Useful because some attacks can not be evaded in any other ways than by blocking or putting a building between oneself and the attacker . <p> NEXT Dash system : similar to Boost Dash , but allows to actually chain another attack after it , if used well can lead to devastating combos . <p> Also , a few more details have been revealed that gigantic mobile armors will be included as bosses in the Next Plus mode , and the game will also include Mobile suits exclusive to the PSP version of the game : the Gundam Wing Zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 00 Gundam and the Ribbons Gundam from Gundam 00 and the Unicon Gundam from the new Gundam UC series . <p> The above info was enough to have me sold on buying this game . Dec. 3rd ... bring it on ! <p> The Next Plus mode is like the mission modes for previous VS series games - pick MS and do some scenarios , be it just normal duel , destroying specific MS , or just surviving through a battle etc . Those who have played the previous games will recognise the stuff easily . It 's a good training for beginners I suppose , and there should be quite a lot of missions ( scenarios ) to do . <p> As for the shield block , should n't it be down then up quickly ? This is the system that has been used in the SEED and SEED DESTINY VS . <p> The NEXT DASH ( ND ) system is basically where you cancel whatever the action you 're doing so you can move away or do a new move . It 's kinda similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed boost and it 's constant . As a result range shooting is more common than melee as it 's easier and safer to just lay down a heavy fire while dodging enemies ' . I have n't played the arcades myself , but judging from players ' opinions and my observations on arcades and youtube , it 's can be quite confusing at first with all MS flashing left and right while shooting whatver they 've got at you . <p> Last but not least , I hope it will be a good game , and I 've been tempted to buy a PSP for it too . Well , we shall see , since I am still observing closely at it .

Details of the remastering , including release date and price , have yet to be revealed . <p> With the launching of this remaster project , a ' renewed ' line of HG SEED gunplas will be release beginning this November 2011 . What can we expect from these remaster gunpla ? Here are some details : <p> - Redesigned packaging <p> - Include parts to be attached to Action Base 2 ( Action Base sold seperately ) to allow the gunpla to display in various action poses <p> - Colors will be molded to match the color from this animated HD remastered series <p> - Additional markings ( stickers ) will come with the gunpla kit , such as affiliation insignia , numbers and identification markings . <p> Some of the initial gunpla to be released for the Gundam Seed HD Remaster Project : <h> 22 comments : <p> By " remaster " i 'm hoping they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like SEED and hate SEED Destiny ( seriously the first season was good , no god hacks and what errors it had were mainly grounded in its time and some bad choices by the animators , I 'm looking at YOU action clip repeats ) I would n't be able to go thru the series again unless it was all redone . <p> As for the gunpla I say bring it on if they bring them up to todays HGUC HGAW HGFC quality this would be awesome , the old versions suck ( I 'm looking at YOU HG Strike Freedom ) <p> I hope they 're only making redone gunpla of the significant ones ( the gundams , MP suits in SEED suck EXCEPT for them DOMs and GOUFs ) .... I would hate to have the pointless ones and variations taking up release slots when we need so much HGUC still ( Gerbera Tetra anyone ? ) <p> I 'd love an HGUC Gebrera Tetra . But I love an MG version of it better : ) <p> I 'm kinda disappointed though it only comes with this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which only difference is the box and colors . Now , we can mount Seed HGs and has custom markings , like HGUCs . But really , no change in articulation ? MAN ! Very disappointing . And I really hope they release HG Sword Strike and HG Launcher Strike , though I wo n't buy them : P <p> ok , the HD remaster of seed is a good idea , but the rereleases of those kits is definitely not . wish they would just do newer versions of the kits to match the quality of the current HGUC and HG00 lines ( those old seed kits suck big time , i tell you ) <p> This is awesome and all but I really hope that more info becomes available soon . I really seriously hope they plan to " remake " these kits in the same quality as the HGUC and HG00 kits have been . They need it . The older Seed kits are kinda ... meh . <p> Re-releasing the seed HG with no improvements ? ! These kits required major painting to look okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can sell this crap to us in this day and age ? Unbelievable . <p> Awww ... And I was hoping they 'd have a HG 1/144 Destroy Gundam finally released . XD And maybe some MSV units like a Sword Calamity kit for those who missed out on the conversion parts . They did it to Astraea after all ... 
@@35099549 @4099549/ <p> Oh , that 's kind of a hard choice . I already have the Arbalest from Aoshima , and it 's not very good . The Koto Laevatein might do better , but they are of different scales , 1/60 for Koto , and 1/72 for Aoshima ... <p> This sounds great , but yeah , the Laevatein is 8.7m tall , so a 1/100 figure would be rather small ... Nevertheless , if it keeps the quality of this line and all the extras it will be my first Metal Build . The ARX-8 is just too sexy . <p> Metal build quality can be considered very good IMO . I admit that I only have 1 . But that 1 is enough for me to conclude that metal build series have a very good quality such as sturdy material , no weight issue , decent details &amp; proper scale 1/100 hell yeah ! ) . The only flaws in metal build IMO are the price and the size which is a little bit smaller than MG whereas both of them are 1/100 scale . <p> Btw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ( still waiting for Shin Getter 1 &amp; Mazinkaiser ) . But this Laevateinis okay , thought it did n't appear in the anime . Hope the price will be affordable . <p> Talking about personal issues with Metal Build , I do find there are several instance where the paint application is not so good , part 's gate did n't get trim off and cleaned properly . And you saw reports of other worse issues online . <p> I wonder , if these quality issues are something buyer could accept for a toy at this price range ? <p> The availability is also another issue , however that is probably the result of a marketing decision . <p> The Metal Build figures might look ' thinner ' compared to their Master Grade version ( due to design update ) , but generally they should be of the same height . <p> As much as I love Arbalest and Laevatin , imo this is dissappointing decision . I 'm about to collect Metal Build because so far its all about Gundam then suddenly this . Dear god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ? -- ;

I really think that this should be corrected before the official release of this build , that 's why I am proposing to follow either the original design or another one I like ( which I am showing below with two links to their respective pictures ) . <p> Have in mind that no Strike Freedom build has ever got close to the original Callidus ' design , which is , again in my opinion , disappointing . <p> Another feature I would like to see on this build , are beam firing effects ( and why not , those for the 31mm CIWS which were always absent ) , which would give it more realism and of course , it will increase its cool factor . <p> Having said that , I find this build very appealing and it would be a must get if it was not for the high price . I think I ( and you ) should start saving money from today .

@@35099566 @4099566/ <h> Wednesday , August 22 , 2012 <h> Gundam : Looking at the franchise 's future <p> Gundam : Looking at the franchise 's future By Team GG Falldog With Gundam AGE wrapping up in the next six weeks or so and the mysterious Gundam : The Origin just off the horizon ( I 'm not sure Bandai has revealed how they 're going to do the adaption yet ) I thought it would be a good time to sit down and discuss just what we want from one of our favorite franchises . Below are some of my personal ramblings about what the series has been lacking as of late along with what it needs moving forward . <h> Make the story the most important aspect <p> Every series strives for something , whether it be to tell a story , comment on society , showcase animation , etc . Typically the shows which stick with us though the years focused on the story , the characters , and did so in a quality way ( e.g. Cowboy Bebop , Planetes ) . Over the years Gundam as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle to drive product sales . It 's a case most evident by how Bandai treated Gundam AGE . Products accompanying the series were announced early and many of the new designs to show up in the series were revealed on screen , but as merchandise . Save for a huge twist at the end many will likely remember the series as having a strong premise , some good designs , but a below average with every other facet . If Bandai wants to recapture their core audience they need to focus on crafting a story that keeps people hungering for more . Currently airing along with AGE is a sequel to the much loved Eureka Seven , Eureka Seven : AO . Now AO is not a perfect series , like any show it has its critics . Yet each week it draws in egar viewers . I do n't know the numbers enough to say whether it 's more or less than AGE but the viewers a lot more enthusiastic about the program . It 's easy to complain about AO 's somewhat confusing and non-straightforward plot but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good animation along with characters whom have various and sometimes complex motives and you got yourself a hit . Gundam likes to fall back on its core concepts , mainly people from space v. people from Earth . At this point it seems tired , rundown , generic . Gundam 00 tried to bring some new concepts to town and , for the most part , they worked . Unfortunately during the second season things fell apart . And that 's not including the introduction of aliens in Trailblazer.CLICK HERE TO VIEW FULL POST ... <h> Make characters the second most important aspect <p> This should go without saying but I feel the need to comment on it just the same . Let 's get some real , relate-able , complex , and interesting characters . I know I 'm referencing Gundam AGE quite a bit but the series is full of random , relatively unimportant characters , who show up and disappear a few episodes later . Gundam AGE has zero memorable characters , 00 has maybe three ( one for wanting to be a Gundam , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went full retard in the second season ) and SEED felt like watching a MTV reality show . Oh , and as was suggested on r/Gundam , why not a female protagonist ? Or at least strong willed love interest whom does n't bitch and moan the whole time . In general it would be nice to see a return of a well rounded protagonist . Bandai sure loves to focus on pilots who do n't want to fight for half the series . <h> Step up the maturity <p> Remember when important characters died meaningful deaths ? Or when an important character died a fruitless death ' cause that 's how shit is sometimes ? Those were the good ol ' days . Things have become too sanitized . I 'm not sure if it 's just because Bandai is trying for a younger demographic or whether they 've completely forgotten that the core of the franchise is people in mecha fighting in a war . I 'm not calling for blood and guts all over the place , maybe just the occasional woman getting bonked by a casing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can be , no more trying to save every grunt on the battlefield . <h> Do n't skimp on the animation <p> Though the Gundam Unicorn story has some weak edges the Gundam community as a whole eagerly looks forward to each episode , if only for the spectacular animation . The attention to detail is fantastic , from control interfaces to how weapons interact with various surfaces . Okay , I admit , that 's rather impractical for a television series . Yet Bandai should strive for that compared to the often simplistic CGI and , at times , horrid hand drawn animation we 've been seeing lately.Gundam AGE is guilty of some horrible animation at times . The screenshot below is from the debut of one of the best designed suits in the series . Though , you would n't be able to tell that from watching the action sequences in that episode . And yes , I know that animating action sometimes requires odd things to be done but this horribleness was apparently immediately ... <p> Yes , it is going to cost more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well done stays with relevant longer and has a much bigger impact . <h> Compose a strong soundtrack <p> This should also go without saying and effects a lot of shows , not just Gundam . So much forgettable music these days . <h> Keep things relatively realistic <p> No more magic space dust . A lot of people like to credit Mobile Suit Gundam as being the first realistic mecha show . When you watch it under that guise in modern times it quickly becomes quite apparently how unrealistic it really is . Part of that is due Minovsky particles , the original magic space dust , that not only prevents effective battlefield communication ( an important limiting factor for the series ) but provides for abundant power and a conduit for newtype hijinks . As silly as it might be , it 's generally been handled with a certain level of rationality and has quite the support structure . On the other hand you have Gundam 00 which has become somewhat infamous due to its deus ex machina use of GN particles . Keeping things somewhat realistic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nonsensical space ship design . Personally I 'm a lot more interested in a show when the supporting mechanical elements are not only well designed but practical . <h> Expand UC ? <p> Universal Century has the largest committed Gundam fan base and has one of the richest most expanded universes in Anime . Unfortunately it 's also become one of the most convoluted continuities with shoehorned sub stories and content of questionable cannon . Within the time frame we all know there 's not a whole lot of meat left on the bone . That 's why it 's time to expand the universe beyond Earth Sphere . No , I 'm not talking about jumping between galaxies pitting the Earth Federation against Zeon aliens . No , there 's plenty to work with within our own solar system . While generally focused on Earth and the surrounding area the franchise has featured armies hanging around the asteroid belt , expeditions to Jupiter , and most recently attempted colonization of Mars . Instead of letting it just be an interesting plot point the series should ***** Doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreate the whole universe from scratch and build upon the work of authors past . Set the series in UC 200 or so . Humans have colonized Mars ( and no stupid Mars cancer this time ) have colonies and mining facilities around Jupiter and Venus . Expeditions have been launched to Saturn and the our reaches . Imagine a character who grew up on a Jovian facility who finds himself in in the middle of a power struggle over Mars ? Not only is there room to implement the future of Zeon and the Earth Federation but it also opens the door for a much larger political conflict . The concerns of Earthlings and spacenoids still exist but are muddied by being Martian , Earthling , Jovian , etc . Of course this is going to mean knocking some things from the UC timeline , most notably Victory Gundam . A small price to pay so that the future of the universe does n't feature space tires . If need be just consider Gundam : The Origin the start of a new continuity . Start there , jump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Year War through Unicorn . Hell , it would even allow for someone to back and rework Gundam ZZ . The biggest concern would be how to handle newtypes . At the rate things are going by UC 200 , with a significant portion of the Human population living in space , you 'd think newtypes would be everywhere . Maybe there are , maybe there 's a conflict with oldtypes , there are a lot of different ways to handle it . While it 's an important part of the franchise I do n't think anyone wants it to become overloaded with crazy newtype powers . <p> I 've had more thoughts over the past few months but that 's all I can recall right now . I 'm sure someone will swoop in shortly and post a much more eloquent piece on the future of the franchise and make me look silly . As you should though . With any luck positive feedback will one day make it back to the folks in charge of the franchise and let things head in a different direction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how things went . Since then the story has been pretty bland and uninteresting . For the most part I still do n't have an issue with the designs , mecha or character . <p> So your feedback is " EVERYONES A FAG THEY CA N'T THINK ? " I 'm pretty sure that is not good feedback . Just because people browse 4chan does n't immediately made them act like utter retards . That is something you have to decide to do for yourself . Which is clear the above poster has decided is the only course of action right for them . <p> AGEs biggest problem is it refuses to commit to any one story line and then throws its self into a bad arc in a last ditch attempt to find something to do with the next set of episodes . Look at the most recent episodes with the Traitor , its a 3 episode arc which leads absolutely no where and ultimately did nothing to move the plot forward . If AGE just committed to the 3 generation story and held its self together it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged , one just wants balance and the other wants to end all fighting in an unrealistic way is a great final arc ) , but instead it muddles around and then characters suddenly switch motivations ( Zeheart and Asem both suffer badly from this . ) <p> I would disagree saying AGE has no meaningful characters though . Woolf was a great character and stood out way above the rest of the cast . Its just a shame AGE wastes him for little more than repainting AGE 2 to make more cash . He could of been a lot more than he was , but even so he s still one of the best Gundam veterans who will be sacrificed . <p> I think the maturity aspect is a big problem lately . It impacts both the story and the characters . For once I would like to see a character who does n't want understanding and who just wants to survive a war that can take anyone at any time ( like that shell casing you mentioned ) . Gundam has been using the " one person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . I feel they need to make the main character a part of something bigger and not just a swiss army knife of a pilot who can accomplish everything . <p> A return to pre-digital animation quality would also be great . I love the way they used shading in older anime , now its all just 1 tone shading on basic colours . <p> Why is there too much focus on " understanding each other " in Gundam lately ? " Understanding each other " is overrated and deeply flawed concept . Let us say that we perfectly understand each other . Will that " understanding " benefit me or is it in my best INTEREST ? <p> Ribbons understood what Setsuna , Tiera etc. wanted . He did n't want that " understanding " because it was against his own interest . <p> Exactly ! " Understanding " in gundam implies that everyone wants peace . Some people do n't  , some want to kill , some want a miltary promotion and some will just do their job instead of listening to an enemy 's propaganda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is bad they have definitely lost the ability to SHOW it . Now its just a slogan of protagonists that you must accept or shut up . <p> Some good things here . but harping on Age a bit to much .. While I have the same complaints .. its a kids show .. trying to get new people in the fold .. which I appreciate . It has a brilliant concept , one which if they turned it a bit darker , would be an Epic series .. but I digress <p> Gundam Age was not my cup of tea especially when it came to the story department or the suits them selfs . I found my self going back to the old series and the side Ms stories . I hope we get a bad ass series in the near future . <p> I will not say everything about story of AGE , I admit it that AGE has been turned worse at 2nd gen with useless character and Kio Yamato . But you are wrong when compared AGE with Stardust Memory . Hey , you compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 00 TV series too ? <p> Japan loves their angsty , conflicted protagonists , so i guess we ca n't expect anything new there , but it can be pulled off nicely if done properly ( think transformers animated optimus . ) <p> as for designs , the 70s-80s real robot designs look really appealing to me , but then again each has their own aesthetic preference . i love the rx-78 but some people simply think it is too boring without giant beam spam guns and energy wings . <p> I did n't get the sense that GG defended AGE when it was pre-launching . " Guys give it a chance ... " kind of mentality was what I was getting . When I saw the new designs and characters , I threw my hands up but GG remained positive and did say it was gon na be a kiddie show , people are gon na throw their hands up but its a marketing angle . Great food for thought GG . <p> honestly I do n't mind AGE , i like its mech designs and the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't bad per say.i do find it weird so many people dislike 00 i enjoyed both seasons ( i just pretend the movie does n't exist ) its a story about trying to forcefully change the world and its ramifications . what Bandai could do in the future to really bring things back to glory though imo is do crossbone gundam its a glorious manga with fantastic designs , story and characters . <p> Personally I think it would be cool if Sunrise made a Crossbone Gundam OVA , or maybe they could make gundam series with more strong female protagonists . If I remember right , the only female gundam protagonist I can think of was Christina Mackenzie , and I 'm not even sure if she is the protagonist . Like I said before , gundam is the same timeless story of the hell that war is , and it is a lesson that everyone should try to learn . I feel that every gundam series I 've watched has triggered a change in me , and I feel that Gundam can do the same for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendsetter of realistic mecha warfare with twists of fates , politics and tragics . <p> Zeta and ZZ are more based on teenage angst and rebellious natures of young people towards the dominating adults <p> Nu and F91 are basically SCANDALOUS with history of internal corruptions and power abuses that turn both potential shows into flops . Crossbone is just an example of lame cover-ups . <p> G Gundam is trying to ride on the Street Fighter popularity but ended up becoming a freak show circus act <p> Wing is like the Backstreet Boys or Boyzone of Gundam , which are proven to be more popular among female fan groups <p> SEED franchise are nothing more but rehashed old works because Bandai is too cheap to come up with better designs and animes <p> 00 tries to copy Wing 's boy group formula but the whole thing gone out of control and become the most GAY Gundam anime in history <p> At the end of the day , whether what is Gundam 's next step actually lies in Bandai 's next plan for their money making strategy . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something epic for Gundam since profit is their priority , not creativity and good story plots . <p> We might see more innovations in Gunpla and toy making from Bandai , but we wo n't see anything new coming up in the Gundam franchise . Therefore , I guess the best way to rejunevate Gundam is to SHUT DOWN the entire Gundam franchise to do some serious soul searching <p> 00 revitalized the alternate universe end of the gundam franchise . wing was good , g gundam was alright ( it was also a different kind of gundam ) and turn a was weird but was supposed to be weird and different . <p> Finally someone from Team GG that dares to post his opinions on the website . Good read , and I agree with much of what you said . <p> IMO , 00 could have become one of the best Gundam Series had it not been for its horrible Season 2 . Honestly , 00 S1 's second half was extremely good when everything started kicking in . Only to be followed by the abysmal S2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of few robot shows licensed in the west therefore people put all their hopes on it expecting it to be like mechwarrior or transformers so you have an extremely polarised fanbase who all want different things . <p> I think maybe in Japan , if someone does n't like the ideas in Gundam , there many other robots shows that are easily accessible and fit their taste . <p> It could be great if Sunrise made a Crossbone Tv series and follow it with an ova of steel 7 . Cuz in my opinion it has great story , nice characters , deferant approach , cool mobile sutis and It would do F91 justice <p> Crossbone OVA sounds like a pretty good idea to continue into the future ! Expansion of the UC would definitely get the attention of old fans and who knows , maybe a new fan base from AGE too . With the first 100 years of UC near completion , it may now be the time to bridge the gap between Unicorn and F91 ( or Hathaway 's Flash to F91 , etc ) . F91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to learn of the world that came to be after Zeon . <p> If Sunrise were to come up with a completely new series , I think AGE had a lot of successful MS designs that can go onto inspiring future designs like the G-Exes and Bouncer . Story wise , I hope they can do better lol . But got ta admit , AGE went better since 2nd series . <p> But for now , we must wait for AGE to finish and for Unicorn to make its glorious epic ending ( saddening to think about it ) . <p> gundam 00 movie sucks ? ? ? personally I do n't think so , it 's just you that you did n't understand the true meaning of the movie . then from what I 've understand among you gundam " fans " you always complain all about in little things and then make it big ( facepalm ) . you 're never satisfied on anything . personally i think gundam 00 is a good series and season 2 is n't a let down imo. most of you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new things , <p> I agree , I liked the movie as well . It was n't perfect but I think it successfully concludes the 00 saga . I think many people are too quick to jump onto the hate bandwagon and did n't pay enough attention to the story . And what 's the point of an AU if its not different right ? <p> If it was aliens in UC , I 'd be concerned since there was no buildup to it but that 's not the case here . <p> personally i love the first season more than the 2nd , though i 'm not saying that the 2nd sucks or anything like that .. as for the movie , havent watched yet haha .. another defense to the 00 series is that i think gn particle is necessary .. it might be imba but celestial being loses greatly in terms of number ( 4 againts millions seriously ) .. the only bad point of season 2 is how 00 raiser is beyond overpowered and the ms capable of matching it only appeared like in the last episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' overpowered ' moments were not really combat-related . Maybe its the presentation but I never got the feeling 00 was invincible , Setsuna gets ganged up on a few times and had to rely on his friends unlike Kira who was untouchable in SEED . <p> I find 00 a series that 's all in the details . I really did n't like the show at first but on a second watch ( S1&gt;S2&gt;Movie ) I learned to appreciate it for what it is . <p> Aiolia 's plan : armed intervention for human unity , then preparing for " next dialogue " . When humanity are united , will they fighting each other like before ? No . Then what 's the meaning of the unity for ? For the upcoming of another being from outer space . <p> I think that 's reasonable , because if Aiolia to had tell that before his plan accomplished , he will be a laughing stock for people who still fighting each other <p> oh finally I 've found somebody here who speak my language ! : Dwell about the 00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowered gundam , it 's just the pilot who makes the different , and I think setsuna in every battle he engage he find a solution different situuations ; and he is n't a " perfect " gundam pilot/main character from the very beginning but there 's a character development ( for example : regretting from believing Ali and his conversation with graham aker in the final ep of season 1 ) . if it was an " overpowered " gundam why it has been ( nearly ) destroyed then in the last ep of season 2 ? an " overpowered " gundam/ MS ca n't be destroyed imo <p> exactly my point , the only ms who can match 00 raiser appeared in the last episode ( the reason why both are destroyed in the end ) .. the imba ness of 00 raiser is however compensated with the fact that they are fighting millions of grunts with only 4 people .. but then again its a matter of opinion haha .. <p> Keeping things realistic ...... That would also involve on how MS pilots act in combat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they would talk:Professional Pilot : Target engaged .......... Target destroyed . ( in a monotone voice ) --and not--Kamille : KISAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! ! ! ! ! <p> AND no real pilot talks to their enemy in open radio ! <p> Heck even commercial airline pilots are calmer than all MS pilots even under great stress . I would like to say is that more realistic you want Gundam to be , the less suitable it would be for television . <p> That is true except that Kamille Is NOT a solider or was even in the military to begin with so it is realistic for a teenage to act like that when someone they knew DIES on the battlefield . Herro and Setsuna are different since they where trained for war . <p> You know the last Gundam series I actually felt like I was watching something that made me feel like watching a GOOD Gundam series and had effort was Stargazer AND THAT WAS ONLY 45 MINUTES ! It 's sad to think in 2 minutes of that series they already had MORE character development then ALL of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people who hate seed liked Stargazer . Because it had those elements Falldog is saying . Story , Characters and Animation . Stargazer I wished was the sequel to Seed and a lot people would have liked the show . ( If they kept it as good as t was in those 45 minutes ) I liked this post gG should post things like this more often . <p> If the trend in late 00s ( not series ) is still in , just throw a series with twists every now and then , while keeping the human drama ( while in giant robot battle ofc ) , people will eat it up . They want something witty and engaging that 's worth their time , yet not hard to understand . Age felt bare with their " 100 year war " ( the young target also did n't help ) and 00 has spent most its twists in S1 ( 00 S2 also kept their drama outside the mobile suits , while putting the crazy things in Mobile Suits ; see why people like to bash it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not continuously . That 's why Timeline Side-Stories are only OVAs . <p> The 1st Gundam was great , it gave us something new to mecha where there is no real good vs evil plot . It 's just 2 countries at war with a bunch of kids that got drafted . <p> Zeta had a similar formula ( And of course , every succeeding title ) , but Z 's was more tragic . ZZ started out light and fun but eventually got darker during the final episodes . <p> CCA was basically a rematch between the OYW veterans with complicated love triangles and a tragic young character thrown in . Every story from beyond this up to before V were filled with complicated plots that explored the politics of the earth sphere . <p> V had some themes related to the F91 plan , that is a group of rebels stuck between a powerful empire and an inept Earth gov't ready for the taking . The ending was quite depressing but I actually liked it . <p> G Gundam seems to be trying out the tournament formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 's . It was fun , zany but still had a good story ending with the villain having a heartshaped hole made by summoning the Burger king . Good times . <p> Wing was n't my cup of tea . Wing Gundam had too many scenes crashing and transforming mid-crash , the signature weapons we 're impractical , and I thought exchanging the Wing 0 and Epyon did n't make sense . Not to mention the obsession with peace by the same people who massacred hundreds to thousands of soldiers in the first few EPs . <p> X was a bit more to my liking due to the post-apocalyptic nature . It 's a bit similar to ZZ but I loved how Newtype abilities were explored . <p> Turn A IMO was good . The mixture of new and old technology was something new . WWI-era planes fighting MS was fun to watch . Until now I still feel bad for Sochie . <p> SEED introduced a concept I like , battery powered MS . Other than that , it seemed more of an homage to the 1st with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironically beating up both sides until they want to start talking about peace . <p> Destiny had good stuff on the first few episodes . Gundam-jack with the Zakus being used by protagonists . The Minerva swinging on an asteroid was interesting and the part where they tried to destroy a colony to stop it from falling to earth was done better than what Wing did with the Wing 0 and the Libra fragment . Bu then Kira came back and rest was , well , the rest of Destiny . <p> 00 had new designs , and what I think is even better is that the pilots are n't really that skilled in the beginning ( with the exception of Hallelujah ) with enemy aces being able to at least survive their overpowered machines . Once the odds became a little more even , they got better and in S2 up to the movie , almost everyone got better at their signature styles , including the enemy Aces ( You have to love Patrick 's immortality ) . <p> And now Age which seems to be similar to MSG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V all rolled into one . TBH , I only like the final battle of the 1st arc then most of the 2nd arc but not the 3rd . And as of now , I only like the series because of Flit who 's now a crazy racist old man and Asemu because he 's a pirate . <p> What I 'd like too see is more of a war between nations , and perhaps if not a female protagonist is a protagonist who is n't a pilot , someone who 's just caught in the war like Saji Crossroad . Also , more conventional solid weapons and Earth-based battles might be good . <p> lol at the immortal patrick colasour haha .. agree with you every show has its own good and bad point .. problem is too many haters out there bitching about everything like UC is the best , alternate universes suck something like that .. anyway while i personally think Seed is okay despite all the hatings , i sure hate the character design .. the watery eyes and pretty faces just do n't  match a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to GW : I do n't know if you feel it 's a criticism you have the strongest ( of the points you made ) , but it 's one that gnaws on me , since I find it ironic that some people bring up " impractical weapons " ( or impracticality in general ) as a negative on a given anime ( not necessarily GW ) of a franchise built on the very concept of 15-20 meter-tall robots ( that are piloted ) supposedly being weaponry that are superior to most other weapons of warfare . <p> I 'm going to brush aside the real-world arguments usually brought up and just bring up a couple of things within the franchise : when considering the small profile and remote-controlled nature of bits/funnels ( which--in the UC Gundam series--while generally reliant on telepathy , has been also used with automation ) or even the automatic nature of GW 's " mobile dolls " ( which does n't require pilots inside them ) , if the nature of GW 's Gundam 's weapons ( which I think were conceptually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare ) gnaw on you as being impractical ... <p> ... How come the concept of mobile suits in general does n't gnaw on you each time you watch or read anything related to Gundam ? Would n't your thoughts just veer towards why MSs are n't phased out in favor of more **27;402;TOOLONG weaponry in any Gundam 's universe ( or how said remote weaponry is n't more effective when they should be as a matter of practicality ) ? Would n't your thoughts veer towards impractical any MS would be if people in the real world would try to build 18-meter tall mobile suits for such a purpose ? <p> Even if other Gundam anime has been able to tackle the concepts of mobile suits and mobile suit combat in a " more realistic " matter , the very concept of mobile suits are still within the realm of " impractical " and is just a basic example of " rule of cool " ; a rule of cool I happen to enjoy , so I do n't think too much about ( let alone try to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more forgiving of how Gundams past MSG have more and more powerful weapons ( whether they be shields that launch from the arm and impale enemy combatants , space colony-busting twin buster rifles , or civilization-busting nanites that a certain favorite MS of mine seemingly has an infinite amount of--even though that 's not why I like that MS ) . <p> But I understand not everyone shares the same taste , and I think the arguments here on the overall subject of this blog entry amounts to that in a major part . *shrug* Though I do agree with the two cents you had on Turn A. <p> " This is why I 'm more forgiving of how Gundams past MSG have more and more powerful weapons ( whether they be shields that launch from the arm and impale enemy combatants , ... ) " <p> I should 've phrased that as " powerful and/or impractical weapons " , since I believe hand-held or fixed weaponry of a beam or conventional physical projectile nature ( such as bullets ) are more practical than " buster shields " such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a minor error/nitpick from my overall point . <p> Actually , I was thinking that the signature weapons of most of the Gundams were impractical in their own universe . The Wing 's buster rifle , the Shenlong 's arm and the Deathscythe 's buster shield are the worst offenders IMO ( I assume H-arms ' ammo is standard while Quatre 's filthy rich so he can get weapons made and/or shipped immediately ) . I think it was too much of a risk sending barely equipped units with incredibly vulnerable/few-time use weapons without support ( Duo was lucky to have met Howard ) . <p> I do see them in a new light though when you mentioned them as terror-inducing units . I 've only thought of them high-performance war machines out to get OZ until now . <p> Hate to be " that guy " but Gundam 0083 was not a good example to use for the animation example as it was n't a TV series either . It was made for video/cinema ( the compilation movie at least ) in the same way as Unicorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV series , it even won an award for it ! <p> I mostly agree with you but I found your animation comparison just a bit skewed . To compare a TV series like AGE to a high budget OVA like Stardust Memory seems silly . A more appropriate comparison would be 00 or SEED . <p> 1 . AGE 's story is not that bad , it is just compressed into 50 . But definitely a refreshing Gundam story even it is a homage to several Gundam franchises.2 . AGE 's memorable characters ? The protagonists are n't memorable enough ? And who ca n't remember Woolf and Yurin ? 3 . AGE is for kids . But even so , just check out the death counts in this series . And yeah , attacking civilian cities is not violent enough , right ? 4 . I have to agree with the animation . But then , some episodes have great animation.5 . AGE 's music is has the most memorable music for me.6 . No Gundam franchise is realistic . It will still contain some magic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a sluggish mecha with V fins.7 . Expanding the UC is like milking a milkless cow . UC is a classic , I think it should end with Unicorn . <p> I forgot about Wolf , but then again , that sort of makes my point . Yurin definitely not . To the audience she was a pretty boring character who 's only existence was to add some extra level of drive to Flit . <p> AGE 's story is so bad , the 50 episode thing is no excuse . Especially compared to the other 50 episode long series . Things could have easily moved twice as quickly as they have been . <p> I must say that a bit of originality is overdue . I find the concept of a female protagonist interesting , and I think it 's hard to deny that there has n't been too much originality lately . Sure , 00 had a bit , but most of the stuff we 've seen in the past decade has been especially unoriginal . Not to say they were all bad shows . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wished Code Geass ( another of sunrise 's works ) was a Gundam show . I know it might not have done as well as a Gundam show , since it was a new ip and not chained to a franchise so they could do whatever they want . Like I wish a new anime that just finished Fate/Zero was so good , but the only bad parts of that where the first and last episode because they where chained to the Fate series as a prequel to fate stay night . Everything else it 's like OMG it 's Godlike , it 's SO BEAUTIFUL . Anyways it Code geass would n't have n't to change much to be a Gundam show ( Just make it a alternate centuary ) but the reason they would never do that because well for one is Code Geass might not have done as well if it 's a Gundam show . It would turn off people be like AWW FUCKING GUNDAM SAME SHIT WHATEVER ! Also they do n't want to try something new with the franchise and they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to try something new since this formula works and they do n't want to LOSE MONEY . Anyways crazy rambling aside it 's good to see how everyone feels on the Gundam franchise . <p> Fate/Zero was faithful to the light novel , lol , and that includes the " bad parts " you 're talking about . The only thing it really lacked was the more omniscient storytelling that was prevalent in the novel - which I think is really hard to adapt in anime . I will concede , though , that Zero is the best anime adaptation out of the Fate franchise so far , but when you have an excellent source material penned by Urobuchi Gen it 's really hard to go wrong . <p> Interesting point regarding Code Geass ... Season 1 was great , but I thought R2 tried desperately hard to be a Gundam knock-off . The strength of the first season was that it was a character-driven story that happened to have robots that had awesome Land Spinners . In R2 more emphasis was placed on grand robot battles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Float System which just did n't have the same entertainment potential of the Land Spinners . I 'm not saying that copying Gundam is bad ; rather , Geass should just have stuck to its strengths . Then again , I guess this is what happens when people try to turn a good series into a cash cow ( it was just supposed to have 26 episodes ) , which IMO Geass is starting to become ( I am not excited about the OVA ) . <p> Oh yeah totally agree with you for R2 it seems that they took most of the strategy in R1 and made it just LAZORS and then one of the scientists just whips outs new tech out of there ass and make it less about strategy more about firepower . R2 Did ( Atleast for combat ) felt more like recent Gundam shows . Heck even when you see Suzaku about the first or second time in the Lancelot they even called him " The White Devil " so they might have had Gundam on the back of there minds . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THAT ) but they did n't know how to get there really . <p> &gt;Of course this is going to mean knocking some things from the UC timeline , most notably Victory Gundam . A small price to payNope . Nope . I stopped reading right here . Forget it . Just forget it . WHy instead of this revisionary bullshit , they just expand the story past it ? I mean , your dumb story takes place in UC 200 , and Victory Gundam was UC 153 ! What 's Victory Gundam 's crime here , because it 's still space vs Earth , or because it does n't make enough room for Mars Zeon , because we ca n't have a series without them , of course . <p> A nice idea , but you dropped the ball by comparing OVA animation to TV animation , expressing that Unicorn is okay , despite it 's weak/nostalgia circlejerk story because of it 's animation , and then suggesting that Victory Gundam should be dropped just beacuse constantly it dared take UC in a direction no one was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not constantly complaining about what Zeon 's latest mobile armor is this time . <p> It being an OVA is no excuse if in two decades they ca n't be bothered to even attempt the same level of detail . The AGE animation is just plane lazy . I could list of numerous shows in the past decade which had more entertaining animation . <p> Well , fist of all , you seem to not know or realize how much detail and effort is put into OVAs . They look better than the majority of things that have come out even today ! They do n't come out every week for that particular reason . No , I 'm not saying that AGE should n't be called out for art inconsistencies , but if I gathered a bunch of OVAs and compared them to shows of this year , only a handful would be able to step up in terms of art quality . <p> Oh , and what did I miss about Victory ? All I read about it was bitching about space tires , Lapdog . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this mars business , how about just writing further into the future instead of pulling a lame Frozen Teardrop move . <p> My two cents : originality is overrated . It 's not how original your concept is ( btw , good luck coining something truly original now ) but how you execute it . And besides , Gundam fans can be really anal when it comes to originality . These are the people who cry " RIP OFF ! " one moment and then " BLASPHEMY ! " the next . <p> But if we really want originality in the Gundam franchise ... I say Sunrise should adapt Gundam Sousei or Gunota no Onna ! ( here 's to hoping I 'm not the only one familiar with these ) <p> Personally I think after The Origin , there should be a BAN on anything related to the OYW ever again for at least 20 years . Literally over HALF of all UC story related stuff is crammed up in that year . <p> There is so much more UC ! And as you said , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of Gaia Gear ? It 's an old novel by Tomino about a clone of Char in the UC220s . After Hathaway 's flash , that would be a great place to start expanding out UC . <p> The thing to watch about the redos will be the Ultra UC Elitists , which will nitpick any changes that might happen when Sunrise tries to adjust the animation/scenes for new viewers LOL . The introduction of a Remade might rests on the consensus of the older fanbase . There 's also the story/episodic setting , which can have an effect on how newer audience will stick watching weekly . Some designs from the original when translated to cleaner animation might also turn off the newer fans . <p> One thing to think too , is that if they decided to go for weekly episodes , the flow of new quick Gunpla will be affected . New designs will fall on Gunpla Builders or manga/side stories . Though that might not be bad , the Gunplas release per month anyways . <p> Seriously , it could have made a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus it would n't have the pretentiousness of many gundam shows that try to hide its a toy commercial . <p> Sunrise studio should stick to the standard Gundam-Plot . Even after 30 years and millions of fans , no one seems to understand the message that war is bad . Most of the complaints about Gundam has nothing to do with the message that having an " Us VS Them " attitude will lead to a self-perpetuating conflict . <p> The truth is I sympathize strong with ZAFT and the Coordinators . Fundamentalist nuts forced them off Earth to live in the PLANTS and even after keeping to themselves , they still got nuked . Worst part is Sunrise never bothered to portray them as the victims . Both SEED and Destiny kept portraying them as the BIG BAD responsible for all the EVIL in the WORLD . Destiny almost had it right with Shinn , a pilot with a very horrible trauma from the previous war . Things went down-hill for Destiny the moment they shifted focus back to Kira ( DAMN YOU BANDAI TRYING TO SELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more sense than accidental pilots . Pilots with a background connect more with reality as opposed to Amuro-types who accidentally become pilots , which can only happen in a male 's wet dream power trip . <p> Alright , so here are my thoughts after reading this . I believe that Gundam AGE had a really good concept . I was a big fan of the whole ' three generation ' idea . For me , that is what makes the series unique and also is what makes the viewers stay tune for more . As the series went on , they did a pretty good job with the transition of the three eras . What they did wrong though was the fact that they only focused on quite a few character , but I disagree with your statement that AGE did n't have memorable characters . First of all , Mr. Woolf Enneacle and Mr. Grodek Ainoa were one of the best " big bro/senpai " type characters I 've seen in the entirety of Gundam .. , and there were also character deaths that made many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but yes there were a lot of useless characters that stole the show for a while but then left as if they were n't even there , not to mention Girrard Spriggan , also characters that just remain on the background like Odeck , Derek , and some other people . So yeah , Gundam AGE had a good story but not enough character quality to back it up . And on maturity , I believe that Gundam AGE was one of the most dramatic war Animes I 've ever seen , and it 's far too dramatic to be deemed a kid 's show . As to the animation , I know that Sunrise is n't doing their best but I believe they have their own reasons as well . As to expanding UC , I believe it should n't be expanded furthermore but rather just fill out the gaps in between the existing stories .. , and no , I do not believe that rebooting the entire UC would be a good idea .. , only yht original ans Zeta deserve such reboots . That is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the bissest problems I had with AGE was the formula with people dying . Almost all of the deaths of characters of focus have been drawn-out , and over-dramaticized for a charcter who we were only really introduced to for a few episodes . I can understand if the producers wanted to give a little more time for some of the lesser characters , considering how much time they had to finish up each arc , but doing it too much begins to take away some meaning . I think the only other problem I had with AGE would have to be the pacing of it all . In my opinion , I think the first arc moved at a slow-ish pace , the second arc jumped forward a lot , and the third arc just seemed to sort of stand still until they revealed the whole EXA-DB plot point ( which for a time , I thought they were about to forget about for a bit ) . <p> Is AGE Perfect ? No . I would say AGE fits right around Okay . There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would recommend to new people . However , despite it 's faults I would n't say it 's a blight on society . It did have some memorable characters . I have to agree with 00nicholsz that Grodeck and Woolf have been some of the better characters in the series as a whole . Stuff always seemed to be more badass when " Captain Sideburns " , and " Urufu " were given the spotlight . For example , Grodeck locked a couple people in a closet in the colony before it blew , but we never find out what happened to them ( insert colony core explanation , blah ) . It seemed like Grodeck just jacked the ship , and merc 'd two people in the process . Lol what the hell , Grodeck ? ! The show is n't a serious watch , but it seems to become more enjoyable if you do n't  take it seriously . Make a drinking game out of it . <p> About the future of the rest of the Gundam , and UC , its difficult to try to be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated before , Gundam is n't Gundam unless it includes any of the following : Character finds Gundam , Gundam fights rival , decisive battle occurs , Gundam gets an upgrade of some kind , final battle occurs , Gundam fights rival for final time . The directors make their own little nuances that make each one different , but it pretty much stays the same . It really all comes down to who produces the next series to determine originality . I agree with certain aspects that we could use a female protagonist , quit the ' pacifism ' sub-plot , or just flat-out try something ambitious . I am also skeptical about those kind of things however . <p> When it comes to female protagonists , it always seems possible that a the charcter could become a ' moe ' factor who might detract from the plot in an effort to drive up sales . When it comes to the pacifism , despite how much it is overused , it is too naive for a war story , and now looks like it is just used to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trend now , but it can be done differently . Unicorn gets props to the trend by having some rationality to that kind of mindset , but there are more powerful ways you could do it . For exapmle , a character could have a change of heart after everyone he wants to save keeps getting hurt or something along those lines . Trying something completely different is fine , but of course , needs to be done correctly or it gets the fans angry . I liked G Gundam , but I keep hearing mixed feelings about it still to this day . S1 of 00 was quite different and executed pretty well , but it seemed to be lost on S2 when it became more like the other series in the franchise . <p> There 's not much we can do on this end , but I am hopeful of new stuff for the future , and I do n't know what Sunrise will decide to do . I 'll still watch it though , if only to at least say I have seen it just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series tends to go very off course during the last 15 episodes . This is nothing new . While most old school fans of the meta series would hate me , I 'm a huge fan of SEED and 00 and not Zeta . Granted I could never explain SEED Destiny in a way to make up for the colossal failure but remember that Bandai is a business . They make anime series to sell the model kits . They still make Power Rangers/ Kaimen Rider to sell toys , Nintendo still has its Pokemon Series to sell new games , and every few years we see a new transformers series to sell toys as well . <p> Age was a series to pick up younger generations , and I can assume that the majority of the people who commented on this posting is not between the ages of 6-12 . Making crappy series like AGE is so that the Gundam franchise can last another 30 years . <p> So what would I like to see in a new Gundam series ? I 'd really love to see a Sengouku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for territories in Japan , I 'd wan na see different factions fighting over space territory and colonies . A series like that would have a lot of characters that viewers can favor over others . Some factions can join together with others but ultimately its a story about space unification and defeating one great evil . It gives the meta series a fresh new look at space warfare other than the colonies ( Spacenoids ) vs earth scenario which has been beaten to death . <p> i think its about our age / childhood . you see , i watched wing and seed in a local tv channel when i was in elementary school . no matter how people say those series were crap ( i do n't  even remember the details of the plot haha , too compilcated for a child show i 'd say ) wing zero and its giant rifle will always be one of my childhood hero . as for uc series like the so-called the best zeta , i do n't  watch it because i cant stand the outdated animation . i 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of gundam fans like me out there . and in a few years some people will say age is a great show exactly because the reason i stated above , and i think that 's the point why age is made somewhat childish <p> I want to see a Seed Astray-style Gundam series where the protagonists are n't trying to save the world but more worried about things like scavenging for food , parts , etc . Kind of like Cowboy Bebop . Gundam X also had the right idea . <p> &gt;And yes , I know that animating action sometimes requires odd things to be &gt;done but this horribleness was apparently immediately ... <p> I think you answered your own question here - pulling out individual screenshots from dynamic animation sequences does look absurd , because it 's not supposed to be an individual image , only the motion it 's a part of is seen and registered by the viewer . It 's fair enough if you 'd like to say you still think the animation quality is sub-par regardless , but using screenshots as examples does n't make sense , really . 
@@35099567 @4099567/ <h> 100 comments : <p> It was good . I am immensely happy with some of the Zeon units that showed up for a few seconds of glory . I really hope they make some more HGUCs of them along with finishing the ones that showed up at Torrington base . The last 20 minutes ... Well . It was what I expected I guess looking at CCA 's ending . Seeing the re-done short little scenes from the original MSG just made me so happy . Now I ca n't wait for Origin . <p> This last episode definitely reached my expectation ! It answered and revealed everything you may have question for , including whether Full Frontal is Char or not and also what happened to Char and Amuro after CCA . What exactly is Laplace box , this episode releaved it , it explained what exactly is it and why it is so important that both Earth federal and Zeong wants it . After it explained what it is , I could see why they both wants it so bad because the box plays a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark little secret ! I love it ! Neo Zeong is definitely not for a show ! It 's huge and it 's super strong ! There was a point I had doubt that both unicorn and banshee wo n't be able to beat it . Come to think about it , it is like a final boss of the whole story so it has to be overpowered somehow right ? Put for some reason I personally think that " overpower " ability should be given to Unicorn because it is the key ! The key to start a war and the key to bring peace to both sides . If you 've watched the episode you will get what I mean.Overall , it is the best episode of Gundam Unicorn . It explained all the questions you may have during watching episode 1 - 6 and I do n't remember there was a moment while watching this movie made me feel " OMG I 'm falling asleep " It was action after action . It is every well directed ! This is how every Gundam episode should be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't know what to say . It was to be expected , but I 'm a bit angry that they completely removed Angelo 's background ( very NSFW stuff , go read the novel if you want to know the fine details ) , and some hot topics got solved too quickly ( most infamous Marida getting blown up in what , five minutes ? ) . <p> However , the rest of the episode was very good stuff , though certainly super robot-esque like someone else said in this blog . Not that it 's a bad thing , but it was still unexpected and confusing - I will need to rewatch it either dubbed or subbed to properly understand the whole mess . <p> Also , respect for that nameless Bawoo pilot , the guy managed to be as epic as the Stark Jegan mook from the first episode . <p> Beautiful and disappointing . It 's very clear that the production team did n't plan out the entirety of the series and figure out the story they wanted to tell before launching the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much love and effort into this body of work as they could . I wish that they had set up some of the ideas and plot points that ended up driving the climax earlier and more in depth . Several characters and their defining moments could have been better executed with more focus on them and their backgrounds , and several plot points and the overall flow of the story could have been helped if they non linearly introduced some of the conflicts and explored them in depth , rather than try to do a 1:1 with the book 's narrative structure . Overall though , solid effort , and they certainly did deliver on the emotional aspects , even though the execution has much left to be desired . <p> It was a real good episode with a really nice ending . I agree it 'll be better to show the epilogue of the broadcast , but the way they left off was a nice note to end . Although they seemed to have blown the power of the Psycho Frame a little out of proportion since it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'll just leave it at that . What this episode actually did is explain what exactly happened to Char and Amuro too , which is really good . In other words , what Banagher and Full Frontal experienced was what Amuro and Char experienced . The only difference was that Banagher was brought back to where they left off and Full Frontal and Neo Zeong went through time and became what it is . <p> Full frontal did n't kill himself but my theory is because full frontal himself is indeed a reincarnation of Char also because he always referred himself to be just a shell . When they were at the beginning of the universe and met up with the spirit of Char and Lala , Lala said that Char was still Char after all this time and he had done enough to express his thoughts . Full frontal 's spirit was in fact Char 's spirit itself and ointo a full newtype or merge back with the orignal Char. beside lala and amuro . They then brought back Banagher which I deduce on the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on yet . <p> not sure what to feel about it , the novel ending had couple of neat stuff ( beam saber overload , Kshatriya throwing its binder to sinanju , GODDAMN DUAL FINAL SHOOTING ) <p> kinda feel that introduction of neo zeong swayed everything off , and i think i like the event sequences in the novel better than the OVA ( FA UC taking on the neo zeon fleet before engaging banshee vs wasting all its FA stuff on banshee ) <p> nonetheless , OVA did a very great job , and still retain the Perfect Lifeform end except Banagher did return back . also thank God for OVA not going for homo-angelo flashback ( those OYW flashback are sweet too , by almost immediately subverted thanks to Origin going heavy CG route #nomoresakuga #RIP2Drobots <p> also , going all super robot at the final battle . further strengthening my cult of Unicorn having a strong MS frame and we all learned to love robots punching robots thanks GBF <p> Felt a bit rushed.A 2 hr episode would have been better.They cut down the part where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashback pumped me up with nicely animated White Base , Gundam RX-78-2 and of course the Gate of Zedan , also known as A Baoa Qu.On a different note , it seems that Gundam The Origins is going to be CGi &amp; so we wo n't get Unicorn standard animation.Cameos from Amuro and Char confirms that they were really KIA.The ending was open and we do n't really get to know the status between the EF , colonies and Neo-Zeon.The ending song by Aimer was also a bit shorter than her last song in EP 6 , but soothes the mood nonetheless.Hope we get some sort of sequel in the form of Hathway 's Flash or Moon Crisis 0099 . Till then we have to wait for another year for the Origins . <p> Good episode but can somebody point out where we see Char and Amuro 's fate after CCA ? *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT* I know we see Char and Lalah in the cockpit with Full Frontal , but where do we see amuro ? ( Besides the flash back ) or at least what happened to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? <p> at the end during credits it shows people watching Audrey 's speech and when the scene changes to the beach the two people in the foreground look like amuro and sayla because of the hair , at least they look like they be . <p> Shit ! Guys it all makes sense ! In the scene with Full Frontal and Banagher , they go " through " or " beyond " time . It is there we meet the spirits of Lalah , Char , and Amuro . At the end of Char 's Counterattack ( the movie ) , the fate of Char and Amuro were left ambiguous for nearly 20 years . Gundam UC 7 however , shows us that Char and Amuro have gone beyond time , which is the reason the theme song for Char 's Counterattack is titled " Beyond The Time " , giving us a hint as to what happened to them . My mind is blown right now , seeing it all come full circle . <p> Anon may 19 , I have to correct my ( anon may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span over 10+ years since that theme song and this novel being written . <p> So unless the gundam authors already had an idea where Char and Amuro were when they finished CCA , then it can only be considered as a coincidence . <p> However , I see two more places that supports UltraNHD 's idea:1. there 's a manga called " CCA , beyond the time " 2. when Lalah died in Gundam , she said something about time ( I have only watched an excerpt , so can not guarantee accuracy ) <p> Wow at Unicorn 's power ! ! ! I feel since they left it with a open ending , everything beyond this point in UC is child 's play . If you watched the fight scenes with unicorn you know what i 'm talking about . <p> I mean it 's hard to believe events in Hathaway 's Flash and Crossbone Gundam happened ( ye It 's written before ) , as i 'm sure Unicorn could have stopped them instantly <p> The Final ep is worth 4 year waiting , sad that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banshee VS Neo Zeong , also bad ass use pyscho field to block Colony Laser , true strength of Gundam Unicorn . Also I was Fucking happy that Sliver Bullet made into the movie , not MSV anymore to bad there not so many action Sliver Bullet . The only thing that questioning me that they release MG FA Unicorn with beam javelin , in the movie " where is beam javelin " . Did Full Frontal really dead in the end that might be a 50/50 answer also how did Neo Zeong got dust , the only thing that Neo Zeong use psycho power to show beyond the time or when Unicorn touch Sinanju , Neo Zeong turn into scarp . <p> Same here . I paused the movie when I saw Neo Zeong disintegrated . I thought they would give us a classic MS Vs . MA fight after the " time travel " thing ( which I do n't like much , off-topic ) . But then all those rising action came to nothing . In simple words , that screwed up the climax . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in the plot of the original novel are all covered so if you have n't read it before it may feel pretty nice . However , there is a flat feeling probably due to the way the movie was put together . Almost every event just came after one another without any build up . You know , stuff like how Banagher met Audrey in the first episode . Here they just went back , even without showing how they got unicorn in , how they found the place . Frontal just came in and then out , in the new Zeong . The laser just fired , and it is jut oh so easy , blocked by the unicorn . And hardly anyone is surprised by that . <p> But the most disappointing part as an OVA is probably the action scene . I felt the Neo Zeong is probably a bad idea , as it can hardly move . Is n't unicorn 's strength is more about mobility ? I would very much prefer some light sabre duel between unicorns and sinanju . Or even some fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is more convincing . As it turned out , the fight scenes in this movie are subpar , below the quality of every preceding episode I would say . There is just hardly any mech feeling in it . <p> Unfortunately Bandai is the company behind it . All things are double-edged ; because Unicorn kits sell so well , its pretty obvious something big is gon na show up in the end , despite it being relevant or not . <p> I do agree that the Neo Zeong was pretty much trashed by the two Unicorn without out show off anything in particular . Also , I see a lack of purpose for the Neo Zeong being in the show to begin with besides to fill in the cliche of ' it 's a final boss , so its got ta be big ' . <p> It is because they have to pretend that everything crystallizing looks so good and to add the element of super-robots in to this episode . As far as I know , there has been no record of crystallizing of psychoframe in UC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UC novel that psychoframe itself is a crystal-like material . The rest is left for everyone 's imagination . <p> Well in Char 's Counterattack it 's stated that the psycho frames produce energy and in Char 's Counterattack its physical form was a green light . In Unicorn this was also the case . But as Unicorn has proven , the light(energy) that was being shown was incomplete . <p> So when the Unicorn starts to crystalize you can explain it as its " true form " of energy . Because remember that Banagher became the perfect newtype when the Unicorn crystalized . <p> Also its a theory that if you compress energy you create matter . And I would like to believe that the crystals are the true form of the psycho frames . On top of that the fact that it was able to recreate its armor reminds me of the Turn A 's self repair system . <p> I watched early today with a friend . My gods , the other theatergoers were cheering and laughing at several points , especially when you consider the fanservice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually seeing revamped versions of the original series ' episode intro sequences ; of course we all remember Amuro destroying the BygZam and Sleggar Law 's role in it ) , recycled footage of CCA 's finale , and the NeoZeong 's Dendrobium moves . <p> I 'm thankful to have seen the series to the end . I actually marathoned the previous episodes last night ! <p> The episode is a big let-down for me . Perhaps it is because my perspective towards this series . I always like the realistic details and style of Gundam UC , such as a strategic assualt of the Nahal-Agama to Palau in ep.3 , using the cannon to shut down the harbor ( more detailed in the novel ) . But the final fight between the Unicorns and the Neo-Zeong only demonstrates the overwhelming power of the protagonist and a fantasy-like time travel . For a more realistic series , they could have made that more subtle ( I understand that they would like to refer to the past events ) and maintain a consistency in style for the whole series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UC " mecha style . <p> I know what you are saying , I have a hard time understanding why everyone else seems to think ep7 is great ; to me it 's the worst among the 7 , do n't even get me started on why it 's bad ( your point is certainly one of them ) <p> MARIDAHHwahhahhh TTOr so I thought I 'd be crying over for the loss , but there 's too little development in episode 7 on Marida for tears to flow . ( Maybe I 'll watch again while cutting up some onions ) <p> Ending is n't exactly perfect ( like all gundam series ) . Mineva told Banagher to go back to her ... but heck , we do n't " see " them together in the end . Not to mention the second last face we see should be the second most important person in the series ... which imho , should be Mineva , and NOT Riddhe . <p> I praise them for the new content . But seriously disliked there rushed plot development and missing segments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its like they threw in all these characters and said here is guy and girl , they just met , but now they 're in love . Or This guy just shot Marida and now only a few moments later , everyone is cool with it ? <p> Love the psychedelic aspect of the original 1979 Series . The ending is great , but I could n't fathom the old Marcenes got away with " Intend to murder thousands , " I like the set of Hassway 's Flash , very low key . <p> Too bad the Zeta Plus did n't do much , got its ass kicked by a Jesta , seems improbable considering how awesome ZG is when compared to the old old old Zeon MS , which put up a major fight in this series . <p> Really well done , expect for the plot part . The last 30 or so minutes the reasons allowing for the story to reach the ending as it is is constantly slapping you in the face with " Because psychoframe ! " and " Because newtype ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gundam as hard Sci-Fi . The almighty Kira Yamato looks bleak compared to Ep.7 version of Banagher . <p> I think its because you hold it to what you believe is realistic or hard sci-fi . You see the Universal Century has things that we do not have in real life . We have to understand every piece of technology in the Universal Century to understand what happened in Unicorn . I honestly believe that those who have stuck out and watched and read every piece of media of the Universal Century can truly understand the miracle that Unicorn has shown . <p> And it stayed true to its world . The psycho frames were brought up as this mystical technology , because it is . No one has ever tapped to its full potential ( well until Unicorn ) . Every psycho frame mobile suit at this point has been prototypes and was never truly mass produced ( just goes to show how unstable it is ) . Also psycho frames create energy and can give it mass ( that is the light that you see and the crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ) . <p> The reason why Newtypes are being exploited in Unicorn is because they are exactly what the Universal Century is about . From the end of 0079 even up to Victory , Newtypes have been the reason for all the warfare . Gundam is not all about robots fighting or politics . Its about evolution and how we as humans would go so far as to kill others than to admit that there are others out there who are better than us . In all of the Universal Century stories it has never just been about Federation vs Zeon ( or other Empires ) . It was about the Federation vs Newtypes vs Zeon . Where the Federation and Zeon sees only one side of a circle where as the Newtypes see the whole circle . <p> So what I 'm trying to say is that Unicorn still is grounded in its reality and grounded in logic . <p> My thoughts on series overall : Plot was awesome but characters were weakly written and developed . <p> Main plot : Awesome ! The whole box thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how it affects the UC is more than enough to satisfy . <p> Characters : Weak . Perhaps the weakest point of this whole thing . Banagher : Acts like he knew the princess for a long time . Always doing things obsessively for her . I would understand if they were given more time to develop their relationship or even friendship , but no , the writers were like : " Here is guy and girl and they love each other . deal with it ok ? " Barely any development at all in this department . I mean Banagher just met his person right ? <p> Audrey Burne : Ca n't the writers give her more personality ? So monotone and boring . Hardly any expressions at all . Yes , she is strong , but also one dimensional . <p> Riddhe : WTF you shot Marida ! and they act alike it 's all ok in just a shot time afterwards . The guy pulled the trigger and yet is acting like nothing happened and be all heroic at the end . Felt no consequence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else seems to be ok with it as well . ) Oh , and his character during the whole thing was so inconsistent . Poorly written . For example : Loves Audrey from out of the blue . I mean c'm on writers . at least develop your charater 's relationships and not just have them falling for this boring princes all of a sudden . <p> Micott : Most useless character in all of Gundam history . Think about the series as a whole , now imagine it without all of her scenes . Much better right ? It seems the writers had ideas for her but all of a sudden abandoned it . Then she just became a minor annoyance . Even Takuya had his uses and I felt he had enough screen time appropriate for his role . <p> Everyone else was ok , or at least acceptable , or I forget as a write this . <p> That 's been a failing of several otherwise great Gundam stories , most notoriously CCA and Zeta Gundam . All I can figure is Tomino got really bored on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degenerated into inexplicable acronym soup . Every time they wanted to uber the pilots up another notch they just trotted out another gizmo with a catchy but meaningless acronym . <p> Animation was of course amazing . Sound track was awesome . Had its WOW moments and I was definitely entertained . Ending could have been better . The flash back scenes were cool but WTH ? ! ? How was that all even possible ? How Full Frontal and Angelo lost was pretty much lame . I was expecting a better fight scene with Ace Pilots such as them . Still a good episode but too similar to CCA . I love Gundam but this was too much " magic " for me . How the Hell did the Unicorn rebuild its damaged body parts ? ! ? ! ? ! So we know Char is dead but what about Amuro ? I 'm glad they did n't have the main character get messed up somehow or dead . ( Sorry for Spoilers ! ) <p> I thought the finale was pretty exceptional given the lore of the timeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that we had 6 hours of it previous to this and for most characters it is enough but some get the short end of the stick . Full Frontal I would have liked an outright answer but if people paid attention that is resolved . The only faction I felt did not get enough development was the Vist Foundation ... <p> But people have to realize that this OVA had the honor of resolving the Newtype storyline that was coming to a head in this series and effectively kinda making F91 and VIctory questionable but more like side stories . Did all of this newtype stuff bug me ? A little when the fight with the Neo Zeong but I felt that it should have done a little differently . As for the Axis Shock at the end I was expecting it and it was said in story that laws of physics do n't apply and there is a bit of metaphysical messages and ques here . This matches the themes . I do n't exactly feel its crappy writing necessarily only when it interrupts a fight like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the Universal century here I would be fine as it provides the answer to the question of newtypes existence , it bookends the Zeon conflict , it also opens the door for the reformation of the Federation and the whole power system since the colonies can now declare independence as it is their right . Which is why I question if it nullifies F91 and Victory . It could or could not . All because of that box . But like I said it bookends the UC timeline and I am fine with that . <p> Rolled my eyes when the unicorn used pressure pointing to disable the Neo Zeong . The last bit also seemed forced , the psychoframe went beyond a deus ex function . The way the unicorn also hand-waved the feddie suits with an emp-like thing also was n't good . I liked the ending though , its not as bleak as the novel and is in line with " Hope " and " possibility " for a better future theme . Its a 7.0 for me . <p> Looks like the reception is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no shame saying tears rolled my cheeks and my throat was under pressure when Marida died ( as she 's my favourite character in the OVA ) and when Banagher released the full power of the psychoframe , crystalizing the Unicorn , it was just too beautiful . <p> Of course I went " wat ? " because of all the extra magic induced by the psychoframes and newtypes but I did n't let that get in the way of my enjoyment . I 'm going past all the " magic crap " , the emotions sent during all the **29;431;TOOLONG scenes struck me , they were strong and I 'm really happy . Sure i 'd love an epilogue but I 'm pleased by the ending overall <p> I liked it . I did n't read the novels so I ca n't offer a comparative point of view about what could be done better or not , but I think it 's a very good movie . As the other chapters the animation is impeccable as its music . Kudos for all the diferent mobile suits they integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical development in the entire Universal Century.I agree , it 's not perfect though . The characters are kinda plain and their development is weird ( I saw you and I love you Audrey/Mineva ) , but given the format and runtime it 's forgivable IMO . Neo Zeong is cool but I would have prefered a full-speed battle with Sinanju . Also some events do happen too quickly as some other people have pointed.This final chapter remind me a lot of CCA . A full scale battle with an ending by psycoframe . It might went overboard in that matter but the visual and emotional aspects complemented very well . Different case to 00 movie , where everything went fullcolors but had zero emotional development . I was glad to have Banagher coming back to Mineva and Frontal returning to Angelo as well . It pains me the death of Marida but the last conversation with Zinnerman was a nice touch from the writers.It was a nice surprise to finding what actually the Laplace box was and why it was so important . That made clear that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , the strong point of Gundam it 's the politics , the evolution of the human being and the search of true understanding . If all Universal Century ended with this , I 'd be a very pleased fan . However I think that even knowing the contents of the Laplace box , we 're still a very young species and the conflicts will be very hard to overcome because there 's a long trail of blood that is very hard to forgive . F91/Crossbone and Victory are still a very plausible outcome.But also there 's still the " god that is probability inside of us " so a happy ending is also probable . <p> Can someone explain to me why alberto vist feels so strongly for marida cruz ? I know that marida saved albeto 's life but is there another reason i 'm missing or some back story i am unaware of ? Alberto sends in Riddhe Marcenas to save marida going behind martha 's back to save her.He fully breaks down in tears after she dies and he heard her speak after she died and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is willing to admit it but the others are n't . <p> I want to understand what relationship they have , it seems a little bit off if the only thing that binds alberto to marida is the fact she saved his life considering his character . <p> I enjoyed this visually and emotionally striking ( if a bit too " magic-y " ) finale , but I have to admit to being rather sad and disappointed with the whole " fate of Amuro and Char " thing . Amuro has always been my favorite Gundam protagonist ( and all-time champion of MS ass-kicking ) , and Char is my favorite Gundam antagonist . Now , it 's not like I ever expected there to be a point when a door opened up and in walked Amuro , alive and well , or it 's revealed that Char ( the real Char ) was hiding all this time to mastermind another insurrection , I understand how unlikely that would be , but closing the door on any outcome more fun and interesting than them being these **41;462;TOOLONG is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains how they wind up in all those SRW games , eh ? ) . It 's been over 25 years since CCA ( holy shit ! ) , and seeing as how Gundam UC is ostensibly a sequel to it . If you 're going to offer some kind of final word on Amuro and Char , and considering all the crazy , unrealistic stuff going on already , I guess secretly I really was hoping for something better . I always felt bitterly unsatisfied with the ending to CCA , but now I kind of miss the " openness " of it ; Amuro and Char 's own " beast of possibility " . I do think that the Char/Amuro moment in this final UC episode is not so cut and dried and bears more examination than I 've seen so far , but I do n't think their " fate " will be much more satisfying this time than it was last time . Well , I really liked this episode , and the series as a whole , but with any luck , " Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Char , or Universal Century Gundam either . Y'never know ... <p> I read somewhere that there may be up to 40 billion people in the earthsphere . Somebody is always going to get mad at authority , gain power and rise up . This is espeially true if most people are living in colonies which can almost be considered little ' fiefdoms ' like in 0080 and f91 . Zeon came from side 3 <p> What I like about it the most is the fact they say the UC will eventually end and people will forget newtypes . It leaves you wondering if all the other gundam series with some other name century is in the same universe . 
@@35099568 @4099568/ <h> Wednesday , April 13 , 2011 <h> GUNDAM UC Episode 03 ' The Ghost of Laplace ' Review <p> This review is spoiler heavy , please read at your own discretion.Story/Plot - 8.9/10 <p> This new episode starts off with a bang with the battle at the asteriod Palau . We were left off last time with Banagher and the Unicorn being taken as prisoner on the asteriod . This new episode begins with the execution of the battle plans discussed in the previous episode , which was to cause a distraction by splitting up the 4 asteroids of Palau with the ultimate goal of retrieving Banagher and the Unicorn Gundam . <p> This was yet another great episode , the pacing definitely felt a bit rushed in some places through the episode , but it can be viewed as a good thing in the sense that it adds to the sense of urgency and we 're not left dawdling around like some moments in the previous 2 episodes . It was a good change of pace . <p> The separation of the 4 asteroids that make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ECOAS , as expected . This is immediately followed up with the deployment of mobile suits from both sides and the firing of the hyper mega particle cannon from the Londo Bell 's battleship Nahel Argama . <p> The power of the Hyper Mega Particle Cannon is seen as it tears through enemy mobile suits as well as it ripping through the asteroids of Palau as if they were a thin sheet of tissue paper . This reminds me of the Endless Waltz movie where Wing Zero Custom blasts the underground fortress towards the end of the movie . Quite an impressively powerful beam blast . <p> Banagher then is seen making his way to Gate #14 where he meets up with his Unicorn Gundam once again . Are we about to see some intense battles soon ? Let 's hope so ! <p> Outside , the battle continues as Palau is being bombarded . Full Frontal steps into battle in his Sinanju and slaughters many mobile suits with ease , and finally Banagher shows up in the Unicorm Gundam . Things really start to really pick up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field to duke out some heavy damages . <p> The Unicorn begins by trying to use the Beam Gattling gun . The charge is n't quite ready yet and the Unicorn takes a beating . But soon enough , the Beam Battling Gun fires and pwns the Driessen that was attacking . Banagher then contemplates the reason for war , and starts to show some signs of doubt . <p> Riding in Riddhe Marcenas 's mobile suit Delta Plus , Audrey comes into communication with Banagher . Riddhe Marcenas then opens the cockpit , as Audrey tells Banagher her plan to go down to earth to meet with Riddhe 's father Assemblyman Ronan Marcenas , and tell him everything that had happened in hope to find a peaceful resolution for the current conflict . <p> The Unicorn manages to disable Marida 's control over her funnels and the Unicorn starts pwning . In between battle sequence though , there was quite a lot of discussion from Full Frontal explaining the Psycho Frame and the New Type Destroyer ( NT-D ) system . Filler scenes if you ask me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues its barrage on the Kshatriya ... nearly killing Marida in the process . But of course in typical Gundam style , they go into their naked-newtype mental world . Marida 's past is shown , and Banagher stops the fighting . <p> Kind of a lame way to end the battle after so much angst that was built up from the start . It could have lasted a little bit longer . But again , this episode 's pacing was definitely faster . <p> Banagher then wakes up from his bed in the medical ward , defending Marida claiming that she would never harm anyone else , and the assumptions made about her being a cyber newtype were not true . There 's a lot of philosophical talk in between , and Banagher goes to visit Marida who is still lying on the sick bed . <p> Daguza and Banagher have a discussion . He makes a note that Banagher has gone into combat 3 times now with the Unicorn , and that he may have saved some lives , while other lives were lost . He says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Banahger just walks out feeling upset . <p> We get some insight on Daguza . He does n't seem a bit softer , and not much of a badass/hardass that he portrayed in the previous episodes ... Nice bit of character development there . <p> Now we move on to what seems like the final battle for this episode . And it was an epic hell of a fight . So far , the fights in this episode have been a bit on the dull side . This is an OVA series that they have months to prepare , animate , etc and we really should n't have to go throught yet another relatively dull fight with the Kshatriya vs . Unicorn . <p> The battle near the Eath 's atmosphere starts off really well . We get a strange radio signal . The battle starts off with an epic soundtrack . Full Frontal makes his appearance in his Sinanju . In an effort to give Banagher motivation to fight hard , Daguza sacrifices himself as a decoy . As Full Frontal come into contact with the Unicorn inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shoots a rocket right at Sinanju 's face . That only did little damage , and Daguza was killed right there saluting Banagher . <p> That moment was emotionally daunting enough for Banagher to re-awaken the Newtype Destroy Mode , and Banagher goes on a rampage shooting his beam rifle and went after Full Frontal . Angelo tries to engage Unicorn , but the Unicorn easily cuts him up , but did n't kill him . <p> Then the Sinanju and Unicorn goes into intense battle . In a fit of anger , Banagher goes head on while both the Unicorn and Sinanju are burning up in the atmosphere . The Sinanju barely escapes and as it is fleeing , Unicorn fires a shot right at Sinanju , but Mr. Gilboa takes the hit instead . Banagher was traumatized and the Unicorn goes back to Unicorn Mode . This ends the episode . What an awesome finale . In the short few moments of the final it manages to make up for all the small fallacies this episode had . An awesome episode . overall . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Banagher is seen crying with a tear , and the episode concludes with a nice shot of the Earth . It looks like the fight is going to continue on Earth . EXCITING STUFF ! ! <p> Animation - 10/10 As expected , the animation and art quality was fantastic . Simple as that . I mean hell , they had quite some time to do this episode . =P The beam shots were all epic &amp; grand in scale , the fight scenes were all very well animated , almost to the point of being believable . There were no instances of animation failure . But then again , at the very least the animation quality is always top notch on OVA anime series . They have extremely high production value and the animation studio always has quite a while to create the episode compared to the usual weekly airing anime episodes . Great stuff . <p> Total Score -18.9/20 Imo , if they could just made that Kshatriya vs . Unicorn battle a bit better instead of making it deja vu for most of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score . But it just barely missed that mark . Regardless , this was a great episode , and a great followup to the last one . We got a lot of character development here and got some more insight with Marida , which was a welcome thing . This episode had great music as well . The music accompanies the more intense action-packed moments well . It 's sad to see 2 key characters in the series die in this episode . I wonder how this will effect Banagher 's view about war &amp; humanity . With the final scene showing off the Earth , it looks like the next episodes and battles will take place on Earth . Maybe we 'll also see the Full Armor Unicorn soon . I 'd love to see that . The green psycho-frame as well as all the weapons ... <p> Sorry , I totally disagree with your statement that the Kshatriya vs . Unicorn battle was unsatisfying . Did the funneljack scene with the ruthless NTD system and look of terror on her face not impress you one bit ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? NONE ! ! There was no recycling of scene and those who have n't seen at least 0079 , Zeta and CCA should n't really be commenting on and anime that 's homages to all of them it 's pretty much a sequel series filling out the U.C. universe so maybe it 's not the anime 's fault for your ignorance , ahem Suiton.I really Disagree with what you said about the zero system , the zero system is a straight copy of the pycho frame as plot device to make heero almost a newtype.The battle between kyhastriya and unicorn was probably the highlight , this WHOLE series is about showing the IMMENSE power of the pycho frame and newtypes , again filling out U.C. tech information like why they do n't have it anymore in F91 and V

The last picture says its 370mm long , that 's bigger than the GN Arms . The extra joint parts probably have mounting points and replace the originals on the Barbatos and the Graze .

Try different angle may bring something different that related to the gundam exposure , but i am sure it will be better .. <p> Bad Photography ruins it . A rule in photography , Keep it simple . varying camera angles does n't make sense , seems like the Gundam is falling off the picture . horrible back drop color . room for improvements . <p> Lol everyone in here hating is way butthurt because Vanz is " The Man .

His work is obviously excellent and the only reason any of you posers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't put together something half as nice . He 's an expert modeler , not a photographer . There are legitimate things to critique but your perception is so low that instead of pointing out constructive criticism , you knock his photography because you do n't know what the aspects of proper modeling are . If you did you 'd be pointing out real critique If you 're going to knock someone , use your real name . <p> " His work is obviously excellent and the only reason any of you posers have something to say is because you know damn well you ca n't put together something half as nice . " <p> That 's like saying you have to know how to make a movie to rate/critique a movie . You do n't need to know how to model well to see what you like and do n't like about something . Some commenters said the kit looked nice , but also pointed out the photography work like the following comments . Someone mentioned " room for improvements " , and if you think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just naive . <p> From what I can see , if you look past the word choices of some of the commenters about the photography , they 're giving their advice and input on how to improve his photography and in extension , his work as a whole . I do n't see the problem with listening to advice and improving overall , as opposed to lashing out with childish responses . Aim for the betterment of oneself and try looking at it from the viewers perspective . <p> A real name has nothing to do with an opinion one has about a model kit . I think it only truly matters if you care who 's giving advice , like a good modeler , which would show how closed minded someone can be by not considering what everyone else is saying , including comments made by anonymous people . <p> Everything you have just said is utterly pointless because you only responded to half of what I said . By only quoting the first part of my comment you 've completely disregarded the fact that I said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low that instead of pointing out constructive criticism , you knock his photography because you do n't know what the aspects of proper modeling are . " That obviously debunks whatever point you are trying to make about me being naive as I have stated that there IS real critique to be given . Also , you have to consider the large number of people who place a higher value on photography than the model itself , which is clearly what the haters ( who are clearly hating on Vanz based on a personal vendetta . ) A real name has a lot to do with critique when you hide behind an anonymous tag due to the fact that you do actually know someone but do n't want them to know your identity because you live in the same area and know some of the same people . <p> Let 's touch on the topic of critique . My point with people hating on something without proper perception is 100% valid . If they were able to appreciate the model itself and not the photo-shoot then someone would 've pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . They however did not do this , and wanted to rag on something , and could n't even come up with legitimate critique to give so ; What better stab to take than photography ? If you think someone who looks at professional photos of snap fitted kits in action poses has the ability to determine good modeling simply because they have working eyes , you are sadly mistaken . Lastly , liking or disliking something is highly objective and not constructive at all . For critique to be constructive in any way or form it has to be objective , based on technique , execution , and quality of the end result ( smooth finish , consistency , seam removal , detail , application of decals or lack there of , etc . ) <p> Your argument is solid , and points out the mistakes in my comprehension and points . <p> You make valid points , and helped extend my definition of constructive criticism in regards to modeling with your well written explanation , so I would like to thank you . I believe you meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objective ) , but I believe I understand the meaning and intentions behind your explanation . <p> I have n't looked at the issue of using a real name from the viewpoint you mentioned above , and it helped me make sense of your earlier statement . <p> You 've essentially won me over with your argument , so from here on out , it 's just my opinion , and not an argument in response to your points . <p> Personally , I prefer to look at posing , photography and colour choices etc. ( what would be called aesthetics I suppose ) in addition to the " smooth finish , consistency , seam removal , detail , application of decals or lack there of , etc. " that you mention . <p> In my view , there are the technical skills pertaining to creating and building a kit , as well as the skills to display the work as an art.I think it is worth the time to work on both , because it would be a terrible waste to have a well made kit that was n't displayed at it 's greatest potential .

Unless I 'm confusing the EW with something else ... <p> It 's the non-custom EW version from the manga that uses the original Katoki designs instead of the TV versions .

@@35099601 @4099601/ <p> Check out his youtube page . He scratch-built this using pla-plate , putty and aftermarket joints . He 's building the entire zodiac MSs from Wing Gundam . I think he has the Tragos and Taurus left to build . <p> Do n't bother asking him questions directly . Vegeta 's fame has gotten to his head and he rarely answers questions from his fans on his YT channel , let alone on any blog . I think he just mostly used plaplate , and sculpted in epoxy putty , maybe recasted some parts and used aftermarket joints . Good job on his scratch building skills . <p> He mentions in the video that he used Kotobukiya joint parts for the individual claw/screw blades . Also , the ball joints for the shoulders and knees are completely identical . <p> Considering that this is completely scratch-built , this is an amazing job . Only the rear of the shoulder armor needs any added cleaning up IMHO . Henry even made a small pincer manipulator for fine maneuvering - nice effect !

Mechanical Chain Base . I have a lot of these bases from their 007-010 series . But I do n't have the earlier ones , but now I have 2 of 001 , 2 of 002 , and 1 of 004 ( which is specifically for displaying 1/144 kits ) . I am still searching for more 004 &amp; 005 , maybe I will wait to get them directly in HK/JP later this summer . <p> I also got two packs of WAVE 1/100 Mobile Staff . These will definitely go well with the chain base and any MG 1/100 kits I build in the future . <p> And I also got a pack of WAVE 1/144 Mobile Staff . Since I work with mostly HG kits , these will come in handy . It even comes with a cockpit seat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a open cockpit . Quite nice . <p> Lastly , I also purchased 2 packs of Madman Lighting 's Deluxe-8 LED &amp; Fiber Optic Lighting kit . These will be great for projects where I want to install LED lighting . Each pack comes with : <p> - 9 LED 's in white , blue , red , yellow &amp; green <p> - 3 feet length of jacketed fiber optic cable with 64 stands within <p> - wire wrap hookup wire <p> - 10 inches of heatsrink tubing <p> - jumper for unused connectors <p> - CD installation guide <p> These LEDs will be perfect for modding the Mega Size 1/48 RX-78-2 Gundam . <p> These fiber optic strands will be great to create tiny hanger lighting , or hull lighting for EX kits . <p> The US release of the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam ' A New Translation ' Movies is near . The movies will be release in DVD format ; and I am disappointed that no Blu-Ray version was mentioned . But still , having the DVD set now would be better than watching the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japanese language w/ English Subtitles , which is fine , since I was never a fan of english dub anyways . <p> Fans can purchase either the complete collection set or purchase the 3 movies seperately . Originally the US releases were slated for June 22 , 2010 , but we should be glad that the actual release date is not too far off . But it would 've been nice to have been able to watch these movies over the July 4th holiday weekend . <p> Infomation of their release date &amp; prices from Amazon.com ( Box art is currently not avaliable ) <p> Moeyo.com has posted quite a number of close up images of the Robot Damashii ( Side MS ) Strike Freedom Gundam . I ususally tend to skip toy figure over for gunpla , and would only get the toy figure if they do n't have a gunpla version or include accessories that are not included in their gunpla counterpart . So I am kind of considering the RD Strike Freedom Gundam , the clear blue wing span is gorgeous . However , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear pla-plate , I might be able to do a better job on the gundam . Hmm .... need to think think , I guess it all comes down to not having enough time / energy to build all the kits that I want . <p> The price is very attractive for 2 kits in one box , but I wonder if anyone would consider buying it . Since the RG 1/144 RX-78-2 Gundam would be coming out the same month , and I can already see the RG being immensely popular . I would skip this one for sure ... but that 's just me.

@@35099606 @4099606/ <h> 24 comments : <p> Looks like Bandai 's going the cheap route again and giving Red Frame the Blue Frame Second Revise 's skinny , and very differently designed legs again instead of making new properly proportioned molds for the original designs . Not too thrilled about that . <p> I just stuck a polycap into the no-grade 1/100 Red Frame 's backpack and it fit perfectly onto the peg on the Master Grade version 's back . The shield can be recreated by taking the front of the MG Strike Rouge 's shield and sticking it onto the back of the MG Strike 's . Simple as that . <p> This is n't SEED , it 's SEED Astray , a side-story which is often considered to be much , much better than the story that was animated . People not only like Astray for the unique and appealing designs of the Gundam Astrays themselves , but because the eccentric characters , far more lighthearted tone , and often self-contained stories are a welcome break from the stuff we usually associate with Gundam . The main character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a whiny , mopey , **38;505;TOOLONG emo who is forced to pilot a Gundam to save his home and friends , subsequently becoming a military man and nigh-invincible lord of the battlefield .

Lowe takes the Red Frame as his own machine , and mainly just uses it to do do his job , but he also often has small scrapes with military powers , pirates , mercenaries , and other things of that nature , usually over who should control certain mobile suits , Red Frame specifically in the early chapters , and Lowe , being just a mechanic as opposed to a soldier , usually only manages to either win or escape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual combat skill , and always in a way that leaves zero human casualties . Astray also addresses some of SEEDs previously unexplained plot points , such as how Andrew Waltfeld survived the destruction of the LaGowe , and how Kira survived and ended up with Lacus in the PLANTS after the Strike 's last dual with the Aegis . <p> SEED is actually fine . Not the greatest , but it 's a fine entry . I admit , at first when people around me kept shouting and went crazy about saying how bad all of SEED was I almost got taken away by the wave of this angry mob . But when I tried to open my mind and re-watched the series ( also especially the remaster ) , SEED was still okay . Though SEED Destiny 's story ( again , story ) really sucked somewhat , and I feel kinda bad since in major cases with people I know hate even the first SEED because of it .

But it is not necessary to provide that in your submission . Thx . <p> This is going to be an awesome event ! Hope you do n't mind if I spread the words on my blog as well . <p> I guess I can safely assume that if one were to enter more than one category , they would still only be able to win just one category right ? It 'll be funny if one person managed to win EVERY category ... that person must be a Gunpla God oo . <p> - I understand that to be obvious , but what I meant is contestant entering using a previous photo of a model he built , the photo taken by him/herself . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are models I have previously built--such as the HGUC Zaku I , for example--that I have posted pictures of straight-built , but have since been modified and might need to enter in a different category if I were to enter them with a current photo I have n't posted online . I do have other models I can build , take photos of , and enter ( and I 'm thinking of doing that more likely ) , but I 'd like to explore this angle in questioning first . <p> - Maybe I might have been confusing in my question of honorarily entering . Maybe I need to get a dictionary out before using the term again , but the spirit of what I meant has been answered by your third answer ; I have been pondering that , should I enter , I might enter and want to win , but I might not want the prize . I have n't fully considered this on the assumption I entered , but it 's a possibility . Not that it 'll matter ; I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be building soon , or with an already-built model . Chalk it up to lack of confidence and pessimism , but it 's a " self-realism " of sorts .

I have two kits a MG Kampfer customized and painted and a MG Sinanju just painted.Could I enter both ? <p> Someone using airbrush is most likely to win the best paintjob category right ? <p> I 'm not saying people do n't do awesome paint jobs with spray can and brushes , but airbrush let 's you do shading , tight area of spray , not brush marks or mistakes . So it sort of leaves non airbrushers behind ... =/ <p> Generally , which is a heavier criteria that you guys would be judging on .

Would like to know if I can submit my entry under straight build since it is not fully painted and only sprayed on the original colors on some parts ... <p> @Appasionata : I get what you mean , I guess it depends which category are you submitting your photos . Best Photo is quality in the image over quality of gunpla build .... while Best Customized Gunpla is quality of the build over image quality . Hope this is making sense . = ) <p> Also , would we need to add a quick comment about the peice ? E.g ' This is my diorama of a Zeon fight , as you can see , these spacemen are painted in zeon normal suits ' etc . Or do we just submit two photos on their own . <p> Also , will we need proof it 's ours , e.g putting our email on a peice of paper in the background ? <p> It would be nice if you can give you kit a name &amp; description . We will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for proof , we had thought about having people to proof it , but is a bit of a hassle for everyone . As we realize that some images were taken well before this contest . So we will just trust that everyone is playing fair . <p> Hi GG ! I 'm just clarifying here : " Q : Can we enter more than 1 model per category ? A : No , only one entry per category is allowed just to be fair .

So ... if I have a custom SD Exia Repair , what category would it best fit into ? <p> 3 . Also , about the prizes you have listed . I currently own all of them ( yes , I love 00 and RGs ) . So say if I win a category with a HG prize , do you think I can change the HG 00 QanT into something else , say the Brave Commander Type for example ? <p> Wait a second , I absolutely love making dioramas , so if I enter a diorama I can switch the prize for something the same ( or lower ) price ?

I noticed that the entries also have the names of the contestants on it . Did you rename the files/photos , or should the files/photos be renamed *prior* to being sent ? <p> This is kinda related to a question above , but can I enter with a model that already won a price ( 2nd place HLJ straight build ) ?

@@35099621 @4099621/ <p> Its awesome because the animators of Build Fighters essentially created a proxy battle between gundam protagonists and it ended with the one having the Freedom 's signature stock footage not resulting in a win for the Freedom . Its all the more awesome because the animators chose one of Amuro 's older Mobile suits to overcome Kira 's second strongest , so this reinforces the point in the story that its about the pilots skill and not just the MS . <p> Actually , the scene points out that simply relying on the suit 's characteristics on the show will get you dead in gunpla battle ; It 's been shown at least 2 times : once with the Gyan v Wing battle , and the other during this scene . <p> I do n't really see the point here ; and it basically is a gauge on whether you 're mature enough or not , because most mature people would get the lesson of customizing your gunpla over leaving it stock ; rather than fanboying it up . <p> The GIF was good though , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Freedom vs Dijeh is a battle of the animated 2nd MS.And just in the 1st EP , there 're several examples that skills and knowing your own machine can get you wins . Sei 's dad won the championship with an RX-78 and moves that complement the machine . <p> Oops , yeah , 2nd most experienced after Char . Though I keep forgetting Char 's a Newtype since IIRC , he was only shown getting the flash thing and using bits/funnels but was never able to communicate telepathically , communicate with the dead , or show physical manifestation of his powers <p> what can i say , amuro wins easily against kira , put amuro in any MS and kira in the strike freedom , and kira will be killled as easily as how this gif goes ahahahahahhahaha , well , probably with the exception of a ball unit <p> You 're cheering for a drawing as though it proved anything in reality and have the nerve to call others 12-year olds ? The irony is so delicious . Please continue arguing about whose cartoon boyfriend is tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EGO is that thick that why he survives all the time and because he like to force his and Lacus bullshit logic down other people throats and they must conform to those ideals and if they do n't they are considered the enemy . <p> Hey , look Freedom is exactly as crap as I thought it would be.I will never understand why Bandai keeps trying to revamp Seed and Seed Destiny , no matter how much you try and make it look cool , nothing will be more laughable than Seed 's attempt at drama . <p> I give their Mobile Suits a 5/10 they 're all really corny and cliche . Aside from the GPB Series , Seed has to be the second loudest in the screaming contest that is " BUY OUR FUCKING TOYS , LOOK AT ALL THE STUPID SHIT IT DOES . " This would n't be a problem if they were n't a main series . <p> I give their Story a 3/10This story is the epitome of laughable . There was no real story-telling to be had here . Gundam Seed 's entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of original Mobile Suit Gundam . At first I found it fun , seeing someones reiteration of what has been done until I found out from looking at Seed 's side stories and realizing " Oh my god ... This is their Fuck-it-bin " And by that I mean anything that does n't line up with UC or any of the other timelines most likely ends up here , things that were about a day late and a buck short . Seed itself was okay , whiny , pretentious and emo , but manageable until the end . It was Seed Destiny where I clapped my hands and yelled " Done ! " Because this was the pinnacle of ridiculousness for me , every bit of that story had me feeling embarrassed either for it or myself for watching it . This is the Gundam Series I would give to a whiny child who 's having a bad day and tell them " No matter what you do , it will never be as bad as this " . However i can admit that Shinn is slightly more likable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than getting shot . <p> Yeah , because UC never tried to sell a kit or toy . What should a mobile suit be able to that is n't " stupid shit " ? Keeping in mind that you 're describing the capabilities of something that does n't actually exist . <p> To Anonymous October 16 , 2013 at 1:13 PM.Right , I get where you 're coming from but Seed gets to the point where it is ALL gimmick , from the get-go the strike and impulse have striker packs that do different things , at one point they all combine , and you get Perfect Strike , and later , they made the **43;1084;TOOLONG packs of the IWSP and the Noir . Then when they could n't fall back on it much longer they made side units that could do the same things like the Akatsuki and the Calamity . and even worst , in Seed Destiny , each enemy unit was able to transform for a specific topography like some kind of Megaman villain . While both Seed and UC focus on their more militarized units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than utility . While both series are far from realistic , in the UC it at least feels functional as opposed to Seed having fodder units just for the leads to have something to fight . <p> To AnonymousOctober 16 , 2013 at 2:47 PMYou know what , I 'll give you that . I can admit that the UC is n't perfect , but G-Saviour is a very small portion in the UC that even Tomino voiced his disapproval about while Seed and Seed Destiny are the mainstories of their timeline . I can also admit that I enjoyed Gundam Seed Stargazer and do n't feel so shitty about the Gundam Seed Astray and Astray VS mangas . Stargazer and Seed Astray were way different from the feel of the core series and had nothing to do with the main leads.Let me clarify here that I do n't hate Seed , I just think that its the fruit that fell a bit too far from the tree in almost every regard . From the get-go , the original art was horrible , the story was subpar , the mecha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Gundam and Zeta Gundam for ideas . It did n't feel so much like a series than it did " This is how we wanted Gundam to be " by the embodiment of middle-school angst . <p> " While both Seed and UC focus on their more militarized units , Seed and Seed Destiny focus on the gimmick way more than utility . While both series are far from realistic , in the UC it at least feels functional as opposed to Seed having fodder units just for the leads to have something to fight " <p> The " gimmick " is the utility . Instead of making GM Command Ground Type and GM Command Space Type or Gouf Custom and Gouf Flight Type , you have a standard frame/design that can have its role modified by the addition of an equipment pack . It 's efficient and more cost effect than creating an entirely new mobile suit for specific conditions . Using your own basis , UC is more " Buy New Shit " than Seed in the real world . In the fictional world , Seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't actually care about " which is better " , I 'm just responding to your rationale . <p> " It did n't feel so much like a series than it did ' This is how we wanted Gundam to be ' " <p> Is n't this the point of Alternate Universes ? To take the basic themes ( and sometimes plot points ) of the UC series and tell it in a different setting ? <p> You quote the word " gimmick " as if its irrational for me to point out that the deus-ex-machina-packs are nothing more than that . While the UC has a ton of variants , so does Seed , the Strike Dagger , Windam , Cgue , and Zaku ( ( Could n't even come up with their own name here ) ) has about three or four hardware variants each , and than factional units and packs add even more to that . The problem with Seeds variants is there 's no progression , therefore solidifying what I said about their fodder units just being extras for the mains to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little leeway here because they do have progression to an extent but it is so very bland that it makes it look like hand-me-downs from the far more advanced gundams.For you to call variants in topography a gimmick on equal grounds of the LONG ... Packs is like saying our real life jets are gimmicky because they ca n't go into space like a shuttle . The topography-based variants stopped around UC 0083-0085 due to that magic word " Progress " . <p> The UC 's variants on the other hand have shown many times that they not only have progression , but they also give background into other units , for example The Silver Bullet . It is a EFSF variant of the Zeon 's captured Doven Wolf that has had its weapons simplified and some of its systems converted for EFSF use . It would later be upgraded to an experimental Fin Funnel variant that became one of the two test-beds for Amuro 's Final unit The Nu Gundam . The Doven Wolf itself has tons of backstory too , including a full out development history . Seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of its units . <p> The funny thing about the term " Alternate Universe " is that it ties to a specific subject to be an alternative of . Gundam Seed is NOT an alternate Universal Century . It is its own timeline with its own stories and sidestories . An Alternate Universe to the Universal Century would be something like Gihren 's Greed or For The Barrel . This is the problem I have with Seed . It directly emulates if not copies MSG from the get-go while other series take things in new directions , adding depth and variation that sets them aside from other Gundam series . This is why I prefer Gundam 00 to Seed because while it emulated the RX-78 by making the 0 Gundam and 0 Gundam ACD , it was more of an homage . It did n't overstay its welcome , nor did it take the role as a lead unit unlike the Strike . Gundam Seed 's main story seems more like a moderately-written fanfic retelling of the Universal Century , not its own timeline . <p> Hi-Zack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III , Jegan , Jesta . Progression is where ? They 're all designed to be cannon fodder for the hero . As for Seed 's Zaku , that was kind of the point . Seed has its issues from a storytelling point , but the mechanics are largely fine . You continue to miss the point behind the efficiency of a single unit built to to be incredibly flexible versus several mission specific units . Your analogy is faulty because you 've forgotten which side you 're arguing . First , why would you integrate a system that reduces the flexibility of the design when you do n't need to ? Second , if a company could develop a jet that could operate in space and atmosphere , they would make it in a second . My point is that a single unit that can handle multiple roles is more efficient and cost effective than creating multiple , environment specific designs . The fact that UC eventually stopped this practice is evidence of that . <p> Regarding Alternate Universes , I 'll cut to the chase and say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X , Turn A , Seed , Seed Destiny , 00 , and Age are all considered Alternate Universes of the UC series . Each of the AU , takes elements of the UC series and adapts them in terms of storytelling . This has only been common knowledge for around 20 years . However , feel free to continue playing semantics . Strike is as much like the RX-78 as Shining , Wing , X , Turn A , Exia and Age-1 Gundams are like the RX-78 . In fact , Age-1 and Turn A are the most like the RX-78 in terms of function ( basic frame with rifle , shield and beam sabers ) . Strike is more exotic in that regard since it incorporates modular weapons . Oh , but that 's a " gimmick . " And , yes , it is irrational to cherry pick what is and is not a gimmick in what is basically a 35-year-old series of toy commercials . I do n't buy into the whole " what 's better " nonsense , because it 's all personal opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soapbox , your reasoning should at least make sense . <p> Thank you for your timely response . I love debating with narrow-minded people , but I really love debating with punctual narrow-minded people . <p> Hi-Zack- An upgraded Zaku II type that has been enhanced to use beam weaponry as opposed to the original being limited to shell-firing weapons . <p> Galbaldy- An upgraded unit of Zeon 's best unit from the One year war being the Gelgoog . It also incorporate ideas from the Gyan . Even better is that the Galbaldy itself is a perfected Galbaldy Alpha , So there 's some more progression for you . <p> Barzam- Is maybe the only one I 'll give you due to it being a variant of the Gundam MK-II , but that in itself is more progress . <p> GM I , II , and III- Are ... Are you serious ? Do i really need to point this out to you ? <p> Jegan- A perfected GM , it is the epitome of upgrades . Its lighter , more maneuverable , and is overall a better unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving it that quality of being a multi-topigraphic suit that you keep trying to make a point at . <p> Jesta- An even further upgraded Jegan that has been designed for near-ace pilots ( ( The Federation 's Black Tri-Stars ) ) It has been given multiple custom armaments . Think SWAT/Black-Ops unit variant . <p> Oh look , progress and tons of it . And while you think I miss the point of the striker-packs being multi-functional , I get it , I really do . The problem I have with them is that they suffer the same problem with an even bigger hit , did you ever wonder why I keep calling them LONG ... packs ? <p> In Seed , he combines all the packs into one to make Perfect Strike ( ( Reiterating this ) ) . In Seed Destiny they combine the Striker packs into a crude IWSP pack ( ( Reiterating this again , are you paying attention ? ) ) . Before you go calling this progress , understand that each of the packs for the perfect strike were stationed on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fit together almost like a toy ? Even worst they had all the tech from the get-go ! Want to talk about Seed being utility , why did n't they just mash it into one pack from the beginning ? Or better yet , why did n't they just build it into the unit ? Then it would have everything it needed from day one ! Wan na know why ? Oh you 're gon na love this one . because GIMMICKS : DThe difference is that Seed is written around its gimmicks as opposed to the gimmicks being written around the story . It is Checkov 's Gun , it is Deus Ex Machina , and it is silly . The closest similarity to this is Power Rangers where they get a Power-up armor or their Megazords . Halfway through that series you find yourself asking " How long is it going to be until they bust out the super-weapon ? " they might as well be called the " **39;1129;TOOLONG " Packs . I get the Utility , but its retarded , it does n't even try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for toys . <p> And you 're right , if we could develop a jet that could go into space , they would make it in an instant ... Using all the information about atmospheric re-entry from a shuttle and the Anti-G technology taken from a jet ! Things take steps to get somewhere and that is what the UC is trying to portray . <p> Go ahead , take a look at that . that right there is a shot taken from a book that Tomino has approved , stating that the " Alternate Universes " are in fact separate dimensions ! Therefore lowering the fourth wall of " Oh its just a different story " to " Its another dimension " . Its no longer semantics when the stories intertwine and are entirely different such as Wing 's story for ending war for the sake of peace and politics , 00 's story of ending war for the sake of the dialogues to come , Universal Century 's Chronicles of a long-waged war , G 's fighting competition . Each lead character is also different as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that its Gundam , and that they 're giant robots being piloted , for you to not be able to see this makes you more narrow-minded than you claim I am because you do n't see the big picture . And in the big Picture both Seed and Age are totally on their own . Before you go trying to say " Durr , see ! They 're outside the continuity so they 're alternate realities " I want you to understand that the creator himself has put them into the continuity book therefore lacing them in to his multi-dimensional world and making it possible to be used at another time , just because its not being used now , does not mean it wo n't be used later is some more whiny , emo universe owned by what I can only assume is Hot Topic . <p> And to end this post and turn it back to you , Next time you post , please fact-check your MS 's <p> and try to understand that I 'm not trying to say Seed 's striker packs are inefficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes little sense and while it seems utility , in the grand scheme of things , they blatantly throw utility out the window for Gimmick . If it were as utility as you say , they would have mashed them together . while the UC takes a more realistic approach on test-bedding things before actual deployment , they wager all kinds of jargon that is used to flesh out their universe , even if it is n't scientifically accurate , they still use it to build mecha around , giving them far more depth than Seed 's units ever hope to have . <p> " If it were as utility as you say , they would have mashed them together . " What ? No . It 's better to have specific roles with different equipment than have everyone lugging multiple assault and sniper rifles they wo n't ever use . <p> And since we 're already mentioning guns , it 's more cost effective and easier to move around if you have a single gun that can shoot different bullet types instead of having multiple guns that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minerva was an experimental ship built around the concept of having a multi-role mobile suit with it 's support team of 4 Gundams . Now that was a stupidly expensive experiment . Ca n't argue with the Destiny Gundams being gimmicky but the nature of having multiple weapon setups for one suit is better than having multiple suits for different roles . <p> And to the Anon above re UC 's penchant for wasting a lot of resources creating new non-compatible MS each series/movie , to explain it in universe , MS development in UC was profit and propaganda oriented . When Axis was trying to cost-cut , they ordered some zeon-type designs from Anaheim while AEUG and EA kept ordering Gundams since they intimidated the enemy as a symbol of fighting against incredible odds . <p> To AnonymousOctober 21 , 2013 at 5:59 AMThis is getting silly , Let me reiterate for a third time for you . Later on in seed when they start mass-producing the strike ( ( As they should have done from the get-go ) ) , they also make most of the striker/silhouette packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noir , and Destiny packs . These packs turn out to be better than most of the single-function packs as they have the best of each pack installed into them . What I am trying to say is that if it is winning and is functional , why not just integrate it ? It becomes less clutter and more cost efficient to cut out the pack gimmick entirely now that they have the end all . They do n't currently suffer from " Lugging " anything as its all been simplified and rounded out to be better.While having a gun that shoots different bullets is nice and you may think its efficient , you forget that in seed there is the Sky Grasper , so let me add to your analogy . " It is sooo much more efficient to have a gun that can shoot multiple bullets and every time I need a new clip of different ammo , a colorful fucking runner comes out and hands me my new stuff " To which in a real scenario , we would shoot your runner almost instantly , and considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would not be hard . <p> To AnonymousOctober 21 , 2013 at 6:04 AMI understand the whole four gundam thing as a solution , had they not made the Strike . While the Strike was considered a backup that could fill any of the other four 's roles , it turned out that it trumped all the other one-trick-pony suits with its striker packs , so why would n't they be more efficient and make more Strikes if that 's the case ? And these are scientists that made this , they would have accounted for that , but for some reason Gundam Seed is devoid of basic logic . <p> To AnonymousOctober 21 , 2013 at 6:23 AMAnd this is why I love the UC , It follows real war tactics and progression and Late UC shows their progression out of that phase of propaganda and profit . <p> I still do n't understand why people so got around by this one scene which only a Gunpla battle with no sign of Kira or Amuro , the Dijeh even not default color or Amuro custom color ( Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It must be hatred on SEED to blind you guys to think of it 's Kira , I see nothing more than a good Gunpla fight which I agreed it 's good . Or did you say so to Gyan VS Wing which can link to M'Quve can beat Heero ? No , as you see it 's not them actually , just Sasaki and Sei , then nor as this ... Nothing related to Kira and Amuro . <p> I really ca n't understand you guys , just enjoy the show without bashing others ca n't be enough ? <p> As much as I loved the UC timeline , I can honestly tell you this match-up is BS . Dijeh is awesome , and the Freedom is no slouch . Even if Amuro is supposedly the better pilot ( only by the spatial awareness granted to him by being a Newtype and it 's ability to " Matrix " enemy movements to make them easier targets , whereas Kira has superior reflexes , etc that allow him to move his suit like an extension of his own boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already is. ) , the Freedom 's capabilities still would have outstripped the Dijeh and made short work if it , despite it being Amuro . Kira would have deflected Amuro 's strike , all of you know that . It 's just UC favoritism , not being realistic . 
@@35099622 @4099622/ <p> Okay , first of all why the heck would we even need a new Wing EW ?

When he has no new box to brag about , he just steals whatever post he finds relevant to his wishlist from right here , and goes on incredibly far fetched tangents to tie it in with his OCD wishlist . <p> His problems with the WZC , which he actually built , however unbelievable that seems , are non-issues , stuff that can be atributed to his lack of skill . He says the hands cant hold the weapons ( henry aka vegeta8259 just proved otherwise , just by applying a little paint ) and that the backpack does n't  hold , which it does n't  , IF you do a poor job at removing the nubs from the pegs that plug the backpack in , that is . Otherwise , it 's a very secure fit .

P-Bandai exclusives are expensive worldwide as these items are meant for sale in Japan only . <p> Secondly , I understand that the RG 00 QanT 's Full Saber weapon set can be a P-Bandai exclusive but the 00Q Trans-Am Ver . and ELS 00Q are two of the most demanded Gunpla kits that should NEVER be P-Bandai after many Gunpla collectors were disappointed that the Trans-Am Raiser kit was a P-Bandai exclusive than being a regular release like HG Trans-Am Raiser that almost nobody wanted . <p> I think with Bandai doing add on sets and whatnot , I am pretty sure that we will get a Trans Am color variant as Premium Bandai.But maybe we will also get a Full Saber add on set , Quantum Burst Mode version , and ELS ver if we get lucky . Who knows . <p> Hey i need suggestion . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have money for rg kit and mg kit . This is the question . Should i take mg kit or rg kit 00 quanta . Because i prefer more detail . Which one should i take ? Please comment <p> If you prefer small size with great detail and articulation , choose rg . If you not mind with it 'll consume some space in your display shelf , choose mg . Both of them are great imo , but personally i 'll take rg because it 's cheaper and save more space . <p> As it is now , I am most likely going to buy 2x for this.One for 00 QanT and another displayed with the Buster Sword.I might be a third if it can do Quantum Burst and then a 4th if they do a Full Saber add on set.And of course at least 4 if they do a Trans Am version ; one for the standard Trans Am , a second for Full Saber , a third for Quantum Burst , and a fourth for Full Saber . <p> Only problem I have is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... like at least give us the green ring so we can mount the gn bits in to the warp gate formation or parts that for the quantum burst like another chest part for the extension and the gn condensers should get an extended version .... or you know .. they do a repair exia style and give us a upgrade parts kit : / 
@@35099624 @4099624/ <p> Ca n't really tell because this CG render and that one shadowed glimpse we saw in the show are all we currently have to go on , but it looks to me like this one just has a darker , duller color scheme . In the show , it 'll likely have a hidden gimmick like Julian 's F91 Imagine had . Julian mentored Lucas after all . <p> The version in the show is a color variant of the original , with the extra flash light system in the show just part of the skull on the chest.As a result as far as the kit goes it is only a different color . <p> Btw based on the gundam wiki LONG ... this GBF ver is exactly the same with the one appeared in manga . <p> The Crossbone Gundam X-1 Full Cloth makes its animated debut in Gundam Build Fighters Try . they also add lucas as one of the known pilot . Let 's hope bandai did n't make another HG X1 full-cloth release then ; ill go with this release . <p> The difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an I-Field other than that weapon wise its different from the X-1 and its not a cloth it looks like master gundams cross guard in the front <p> Maybe we will see a MG 2.0 release of the Crosbone sort of like how Hyaku Shiki is now getting a 2.0 ? Then Bandai could spam out using that new mold for the X-0 , X-1 , X-1 Kai , X-2 , X-3 , and of course the X Maoh . <p> So what exactly is different between the " GBF Ver " and the designs from the ones we have already ? Or did they just label it " GBF Ver " as a marketing thing ? <p> According to MG manual and manga , the only difference is the skull in the head and body , instead of using full cloth skull this one use kai kai skull that in my opinion is more creepy . The UC ver should have the head and body skull the same as the skull appear in the sword . <p> Yes , it was stated that the white plastic is pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white in the anim it had a slight purplish shade . That 's the difference between ver . GBFT and HGUC I believe . <p> Which makes painting the Peacock Smasher a little more difficult since I do n't have that pearl white color ... 
@@35099626 @4099626/ <p> I actually asked the producer how he picked the suits for the show and it was based on rights and which ones fans would really get behind but Exia is Shin 's Favorite he said it just has a elegance that made it so unique . <p> second opening confirms it is the last boss of the tournament , its shown in a silloute behind the chairmen , after scrolling over 4 suits , then 3 suits , zoom in and behind him is the silloute of the exia dark mater , with the exia core and head light glowing <p> I have a feeling that this along with the Miss Sazabi make up the rest of Team Nemesis . It 's just pure speculation , but the members of Team Nemesis have n't really been featured apart from Aila and Gavin 's appearances and both of them do have evil looking gunpla . <p> It 's clearly R2 based , you can see the thighs ( better hip joints btw ) and also the two swords , one has clear part and the other does n't ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called Prominence Blade and Brinicle Blade fyi ) <p> I do like the design , but have a mixed feeling about the massive backpack.I think a lot of people , myself included , liked Exia for its sort of clean design , without messy things hanging off like a massive back pack . That was always Seed and Seed Destiny thing to be honest.I 'm not saying that massive backpacks of Seed is bad , I do like Seed , but I just think that they messed up 00 design aspects with Seed design aspects ... <p> I 'd buy this but I will probably modify a lot of stuff as well , like removing that big-ass backpack ( or making it detachable if it is n't ) and making the colors similar to Deathscythe hell custom , maybe paint it all black . <p> was thinking of doing a red/black/some other color custom palette on a 00 Raiser ... actually seeing some of my ideas on this exia has made me decide they would be a bad idea and to try something else ( good to know ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion thoughI understand that nobody likes the huge backpack or the colors but I bet there will be some extra color given by stickers.And maybe the backpack is the new build booster . <p> Judging from the back connectors those large binder like things are thrusters that pivot backwards . Will likely look much better like that than the standard pose . Those spikes on the GN drive look silly though . That and the colour scheme aside , not a bad design <p> if you look at the color and imagine it has no backpack , it 's actually just exia with a color swap , the blue on the exia became red , and the white became black ... with a few extra pieces here and there <p> but i have to agree , bad inverted colors , better to put some black on those reds , change to purple to dark brown or brownish grey and repaint the reds to match sazabi 's or sinanju 's red color ... and maybe some lighter grey color for the frame , what do you guys think ? <p> oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey/silver colors. the red looks so bad ... imo this gunpla needs have better color scheme . imo dark matter should be black color cuz its name is Dark Matter , lol what 's this Red Matter -- <p> Just wait for Bandai to go on a Exia Master Grade splurge announcements with Dark Matter , Repair 3 , and that gray one from the 00 anime . This variant is like if Exia , Sazabi , and Deathscythe Hell EW had a 3 way love child . <p> Kinda ugly in my opinion . And looks very cheap too , I mean it is just like those kind of toys I usually found selling in markets or side-vendors . Yes , I know , if I do n't like it then do n't buy it . I know that . <p> I ca n't wait for GBF to be over .. I do tire of these gimmicky suits that ruin their original 's designs for no real reason . I really hope this gaudy thing does n't get an MG . Save that slot for a suit that actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the 14th or 15th times Bandai spamming 00 GAY people with the Exia , especially when you strip off it 's backpack and it turns out to be just another normal Exia . <p> The color scheme is plain hideous in monotones that it still looks half-baked even when you finished building it , I can see that why the BuilderStrike is more stand out than this monotonous queer . Even the GM Sniper K9 and Kampfer Amazing are much more better than this .

If you ca n't afford it or if there 's another MG that you prioritize over the Exia Repair 2 , then get the other one instead . <p> If you asked me , of course I 'm getting the MG Exia Repair 2 . I 've been waiting since about 2010. =D <p> suiton , it 's not your wishlist spam that Bandai decided for an R2 , do n't expect yourself to be a hero , be congratulated , get thanked or be viewed in a positive light for having the said MS to get an MG . You always bragging that you 're always wanted the Exia R2 since 2010 , and you 're always spam wishlist of it since that same year . <p> Check that out . It lays out information on each of the Exia variants and the differences . <p> Anyway , I 've already ordered mine from GG Infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ til I receive it in the mail . I 'm hoping that the Repair 3 ( even as another online exclusive ) is next . Then I 'll be quite satisfied with 00 MG line . <p> @ Suiton , no you wo n't you dumb ass , you 'll still be bitching and complaining that we do n't  have a gundam Astraea and O gundam. or the stupid Exia rollout. stfu and go die . i think that 's everyone 's wish list <p> @Ares While having a wishlist is indeed fun , and everyone has one , shoving it down everyone 's basically everywhere to the point where nobody can stand it anymore , and keeping on shoving it and spamming even when ppl have asked you countless times to stop , and not even bothering discussing it , as if it wore the Only True Gospel , is not fun . At al . If you like it , more power to you , but I agree with Anon1104 , nobody wants , or needs suiton 's wishlists . In fact nobody wants suiton 's anything . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , complains about non-issues such as stickers , bragging about what he buys , selling it for scalper prices on ebay , kiss GG et al 's asses in hopes of god knows what , lies and more lies ( like his " secret " channel and forum with legions of " fans " ) and the creation of hate everywhere he goes , to the point where he 's banned from pretty much every fb gundam group ( there are even rules agaisnt mentioning him in some ) , many gundam forums and a lot of YT gunpla channels , including rrobbert184 . So no , we do n't want suiton here.And here 's my wishlist:1-that suiton is banned from this site2-that suiton is banned from the internet3-that suiton goes away and never bothers the community again <p> Sounds like you need to chill out and crack open a beer or something . It 's not like you have to respond to him . If people do n't want him to post them simply ignore him , the problem will go away as he 'll have no incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous in the community and that 's thanks to all the people who continually flame him . He 's like the Justin Beiber of the Gundam community and for him that 's by no means a bad thing . So do yourself a favor and stop responding to him . That goes for anyone who reads this . <p> @Ares Suiton has been like this for 4 years . Everyone at one point thought like you , that he would stop if we ignored him . He never did . When we ignore him , he just posts more.and more and more . What you are saying here is the equivalent of you having a store with a very loud and annoying costumer who is always there bothering everyone else and everyone is complaining and you tell everyone to just ignore the costumer . The very simple thing is that if suiton respected others by not spamming and doing all the other infamous things he does , others would n't flame , so he 's the problem , not the people complaining ( which they certainly have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound otherwise . A problem is never solved by ignoring it ( as an example , a friend of mine who traded some items with him , tried to ignore him after he started spamming him about this and that . It got to the point where he was sending text messages to my friends phone , and he had to actually go to the police , who advised him to get a restraining order ) And you just lost any reason you might have had with that last " dignity " comment you made , which is the same as you covering your years and going " blah blah blah , not listening " ( just fyi , anon 239 is not me , so you can see how others feel ) <p> Anon 2:39 is me , i 've dealt with suiton on several occasions . he 's a hypocrite , a liar and a whiny bitch . always saying how he gets ripped off and asking for money who does that ? if you cant afford something do n't  get it , fuck man , when i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not trying to solve it , I 'm trying to fix a different issue . If people ignored Suiton you 'd have one person posting nonsense , with everyone flaming him you have legions . You say ignoring the issue wo n't fix it but will flaming him ? I 've been watching for a while and I 've seen no improvement . It 's less a matter of him and more a matter of you and the community as a whole . Rise above this pointless flaming . <p> Suiton IS a problem . Flaming is just ppl reacting . You 're trying to fix a problem by telling ppl to ignore it . Like I said , he does n't stop , so the problem will always be there . Point is , suiton ACTS . The community REACTS . What you 're saying is the community is the problem , not suiton.The flaming somehow keeps him in check , because when ppl stop flaming he goes on a spam rampage , thinking he has no opposition . We , as community , generally do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have the right to complain about it . If for every post he makes you see a whole lot of flaming follow , it 's only a symptom of how much the community hates him . After years of this nonsense , we are all fed up with his constant spamming , etc , to the point where ignoring it is no longer an option . Like my above example with the store owner , if all your costumers are complaining about a single costumer , it 's not by telling them to shut up that they 'll be less annoyed . It 's by removing the cause of disturbance . I 'll give you another example , a real one . Suiton , like I said , was also a source of problem in many forums and fb groups , where he got a lot of flaming for doing what he does elsewhere . You know how that problem was fixed ? By banning him . Removing the source of the problem , not telling everyone ( who have the right of be annoyed at not being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to just suck it in . The very basic point is , no cause of disturbance , no complains about it . Problem solved

Whether its 0079,08th MS team , War In The Pocket or G , 00 , Wing they are all great . You fanboys are ridiculous . Calling people a " imbecile " over a cartoon smh childish . <p> Yeah . With prices like that , they 're actually encouraging us to watch it for free on the internet . I do n't care how good the series is , there 's no way in hell I 'd pay that kind of money for anything less than 50 episodes . Now if they priced their Blu-rays around $80-110 USD , I 'd still think they 're overpriced , but I 'd be a little bit more comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying over $25-30 for 2-4 episodes in Standard Definition . <p> They 're basically saying that we should watch it online for free or " acquire " it through whatever means , only to later complain and be confused as to why people are n't purchasing their releases . Ridiculous really . <p> Also , do they not realize that the world businesses today do business on a global scale ? So by excluding countries outside Japan like the US and Europe , they 're basically missing out . Gundam is a huge franchise around the world , and by : <p> 1 . overpricing their BluRay and DVD releases2. not offering incentive for " outsiders " to purchase their goods or have a means to in their own countries <p> ... They 're basically killing themselves off . The way I see it , if Bandai/Sunrise keeps doing business like this , they 're going to be killing off the Gundam franchise/brand as well as losing more and more potential customers of their BluRay/DVD , model kits , toys , clothing , accessories , etc . <p> Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Also , I wonder if we 're going to see re-releases or updated releases of RX-79(G) Gundam Ground Type and RX-79(G)Ez-8 Gundam Ez8 . <p> Well , that 's standard pricing in Japan . And as we know , most of the fans that started out with Gundam there are 30+ now and probably earn enough to splurge on BR-Boxes that cost several hundred dollars . Bandai is making enough profit thanks to these fuckers , so they do n't need to cheapen the boxes just to appeal to the westerners that are not willing to pay as much . <p> It may be standard pricing in Japan but standard income in Japan is n't any higher than standard income in America or any other Western country . Think about it , do you have several hundred dollars to splurge on Blu-Ray boxes . <p> Japanese economy is stagnant .

However , if bandai does decide to release an HGUC Ez8 , I 'd like it if they give it all the weapons that were n't supplied with the Ground Gundam ( Beam rifle , missile launcher , bazooka , net gun ) <p> True but my point is people are willing to pay Bandai 's asking price for each volume of Unicorn on bluray ( around $50 each ) which when you add up the cost by the time it finishes will be even more expensive than this set for about the same amount of content . <p> Saying that , overall , people are paying as much for Unicorn is missing the point .

@@35099630 @4099630/ <h> Thursday , April 5 , 2012 <h> MG 1/100 Gundam AGE-1 Titus - Review by Team GG <p> The MG AGE-1 Titus is extremely poseable . Good degrees of articulation the arms , legs , and even the head/neck . The shoulders can spin 360 vertical degrees as well as rotate forward and backward in relation to the torso . In addition Bandai uses a new joint which adds an additional upward twist to the shoulder . <p> Titus feet have a larger footprint forward than rear . For the most part this is n't an issue until you start to move the arms toward the center of the kit , potentially causing the kit to be back heavy . While an action base would enable a lot more fun poses its not a necessity to enjoy the kit . <p> As with any kit there are going to be a some areas of inherent weakness . For the most part the AGE-1 Titus is rather strong . There are a lot of polycap joints throughout the kit which do a good job holding things in place . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place extremely well . <p> The large ankle armor however is does not use a polycap joint and tends to just flop around a bit . Its not really an issue though as design wise its pretty much supposed to sit low . The cockpit area does n't  secure as tightly as I would like but it does n't  flop open on its own . The same can be said for the rear wing . It stays securely in place but can pop out during posing . <p> My biggest issue with kit is all in the arms . There 's some poor design elements between the shoulder and forearm starting with the shoulder-to-arm joint . The joining piece is incredibly short and you 're like to pop the arm off . Oddly the forearm joint where you attach the beam lariat is much tighter . When you go to attach the beam gimmick you 'll likely take half the arm apart in the process . The hand option pieces are also incredibly loose and tend to pop off a lot . <p> Thus far I havent had any issues with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kit looking beefy and sturdy , its still a kit , not an action figure . <p> Unfortunately Bandai decided to give us HG style option kits for the hands . The thumb , unlike most MG kits , is actually jointed in the middle . For the main four fingers come either as a curled fist , a flat palm , or in somewhat of a grasping position . They look good , but as mentioned before , does n't  exactly feature the most secure attachment to the rest of the hand . Like others I wouldve prefered if Bandai had just given us enlarged , jointed fingers . <p> I also found out that it was somewhat awkward trying to figure out just how to place the thumb when using the fist pieces . It just seemed too large and out of place . Turns out , it really is just too large . With normal human like proportions the first bone ( proximal phlange ) on the thumb is shorter than that of the index finger . On the MG AGE-1 Titus the proportions are background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fist portions carry onto the other option hands but its less noticeable when the fingers are n't  bunched together . <p> Titus comes with two beam lariats ( one for each arm ) and 14 beam spikes for the shoulders &amp; knees . Bandai was also kind enough to include a little holder for the spikes . Just snip it from the runner and you 've got a handy way to keep any of those unused pieces together . <p> I also want to note that the lariats and beam spikes fit securely and fell off a lot less than I expected . A very well implemented gimmick . <p> In addition to the random assortment of dry-rub decals , stickers , and detail stickers for the eyes , Bandai also threw in a some foil stickers to use behind the clear green parts . These shiny stickers can go behind the chests A piece , the eyes , and the A piece on the forehead , allowing light to reflect back out . They 're really thin and extremely fragile . With the small clearances required to get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweezers to put them into place . Luckily Bandai appears to be including two sets ( assuming my kit was n't just a fluke ) to help folks like me who royally mess up the first time around . <p> If you 're a fan of the Titus design this kit is a must by for you . If you want a beefy and posable kit in your collection this is the best place to start . The high poseability and joints which have no problem bearing weight are going to result in tons of fun . <p> From a build perspective there are a bit of tricky parts , such as the stickers , that mean the kit may not be suitable as a first time MG . Everyone else should be able to build this baby with ease . As a reminder , the AGE-1 Titus does not come with parts for the AGE-1 Normal . 
@@35099632 @4099632/ <h> 42 comments : <p> I do n't even know where to really start here . Without a doubt , this is perhaps the most disappointing ending I 've ever seen to an anime series . And given the way this just ends , I wonder if the term " ending " is even fitting . Let 's start with the most obvious here . Much of this episode is an exact repeat of SEED 's ending- Kira and Athrun smash stuff with their METEORs , Kira fights Rau/Rey , and ZAFT superweapons ( Requiem and Neo GENESIS ) are destroyed . Shinn , who was reduced to nothing more than a barking dog , was beaten quickly by Athrun . Other characters behave in strange ways . Talia , always the professional captain , displays some strange emotions . What 's the point of dying with Durandal , especially when she has a young son ? It seems quite selfish of her to abandon her son like that . Also , why did Rey suddenly decide to shoot Durandal ? He always put in an effort to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then he himself fell victim to Kira 's own Gundam protagonist babbling . When I watched the first episode , I had the idea that Shinn was supposed to be the hero of this series . And he was- at least until Kira came back into the spotlight and stole the series from him . The series was fast-paced and action-packed at first , but that momentum was quickly lost and the story degenerated into what we have now . Shinn , as a protagonist , went nowhere . He started off as an angry guy traumatized by the death of his family . After episode 35 , he pretty much became Durandal 's dog to help fulfill his plans without thinking for himself . Because of this , Shinn alternately fills the role of hero/villain as the story requires , depending on Kira 's presence . In episode 38 , Shinn was the good guy during the battle at Heavens Base . At the Orb battle soon after that , he comes across as a villain when he 's fighting against Kira and Athrun . During the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good guy . In this episode , he 's the bad guy again , and on top of that , he loses all his piloting skills . He 's so blinded by meaningless hatred that he even nearly attacks Lunamaria just because he hates Athrun . It 's all a shame , because at the beginning , Shinn and Athrun had a pretty good relationship with a mentor-apprentice vibe . That , of course , is long since past . Many people call DESTINY the Zeta Gundam of the CE universe , and they do indeed have some similarities . However , DESTINY did n't emulate one of the most important aspects of Zeta- character balance . In Zeta , Amuro and Char played important roles , but there was never any doubt that Kamille was the star . Here , Shinn is constantly competing for screentime with Athrun and Kira . What 's worse is that all the time spent on Athrun and Kira is a waste . For all of Athrun 's moping and confusion , he ends up being exactly the same as he was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all during the series , because he has no struggle . I do n't think things were supposed to develop this way , but it looks like Fukuda and Morosawa decided to change gears in the middle of the story . Even with the focus on the old SEED cast , guys like Yzak and Dearka are just cast to the side . And Neo/Mu just gets a one second flashback of Djibril standing over him to explain what happened . Fukuda has been nicknamed " Flashback ' Em All " due to his penchant for clip shows and flashbacks . Just as in SEED , the constant clip shows in DESTINY always came at the wrong time and killed the pacing of the story . This resulted in an extremely rushed and subpar final battle and ending . It really is a shame , because the CE universe has lots of potential that is wasted due to Fukuda and Morosawa 's mismanagement . This is a perfect example of how not to do a Gundam series , and I sincerely hope that neither of them ever works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky , but one can hope . <p> I do agree with your view on the ending of the series . On top of the confusion between the roles of some major characters , I think that the transition to the final battle can be less abrupt . If there could be some more setting before Durandal revealed his final plan , he would have been a " saner " or " wiser villain " , who he has been for the most of the time of the series , not a mad man who is desperate for peace . On the other hand , there are many to be praised for SEED Destiny . I love the music , the MS designs , the vivid and lively characters ( aside from the occasional twists from good to bad or vice versa ) . The change of the opening song for the final episodes is a blessing ! Overall , I like the series , but it could have been much better . <p> Same here , the series could have been better . I really would n't mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with it were : A. ) Shin was an unlikeable character , with his behavior changing between childish and insane . and B. ) The cut and paste scenes . There was so much of the latter I thought I was watching an 80s series . It takes a lot to turn viewers like me , who watched it till the end , against a series but this show managed to do just that . <p> The review from MAHQ looks fair , they did n't really insult anyone . At least they watched it to the end . Remember , just as the people who think DESTINY is good and say so , the people who criticize it can say otherwise as well . Provided they be polite . <p> Problem is , MAHQ already saw this series the first time and nothing really changed all that much other than importing scenes from Final Plus , so he either wasted his time or was simply looking for attention <p> So now with Gundam Seed Destiny HD Remake anime over , what are they going to be doing next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think that series is going to end soon and Unicorn 's final episode is coming out soon as well . Maybe they will anime Thunderbolt and or Origins ? I am not too familiar with UC Gundam shows , but I keep seeing that a lot of people enjoy both of those . and I do n't think either has an anime . I wonder if now we are going to get more MG and RG releases from Seed and Seed Destiny . <p> GBF might get a next world tourney for the rest of the year or maybe they can solve some conflict in reiji 's world with gunpla . With the Miss Sazabi and Crossbone Kai still to show up in the anime , it 's not simply going to end after the expected Sei/Reiji - Meijin match . <p> Because it generally is . That does n't mean , however , that an entire series is perfect . Certain parts , like ZZ gundam 's first half , are definitely bad . The people who like certain AU or UC simply remember what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2/3 of the show to mech designs or even a single arc . <p> Of its good any series that is the firs always iconic just like any great anime classics like Voltron , macrosss , lupin the 3rd , cowboy bebop , akira , gost in the shell ninja scroll and bubblegum crisisand check the LONG ... <p> Anon 8:51 's comment on twisted morality is *hilarious. * Also really dumb and close minded . I 'm not a big fan of Destiny or anything , but to attribute a sense of morality to someone 's opinion of a show makes absolutely no sense . Thanks for continuing to amuse with these ridiculous comments . <p> @Anon 8:09 PMThe truth is not everything UC is gold , and not everything AU is terrible . I personally stay FAR AWAY from " polls " and " reviews " when it comes to Gundam shows for the simple reason that they appeal to different people at different points in their lives . <p> Especially when it comes to a long-running franchise like Gundam , you should really make your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss out on a lot of shows that you might otherwise love . <p> I saw build fighters anon 1:53 . While I wo n't say that its completely bad , its just an overall opinion . The fight between a Jegan and the Devil gundam was pretty good . Some recolors and mods are also fairly nice . However , since its really nothing more than a toy commercial , my interest never really went beyond passive . In the other shows , at least they gave us a story around the gunpla marketing . Just saying that 's all . <p> On the other hand , if they went Super Robot Wars on it , that would have been awesome . <p> Every Gundam show is a toy commercial ! Why do you think there are so many shows with multiple Gundam-type suits ? Because they sell better . That 's part of the mid-season upgrade trend as well . I love it when fans realize that they 've been putting so much philosophical stock in what amounts to a big toy commercial . The refreshing part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it instead of finding some Gundam peace hippie like Kira Yamato or Kio Asuno to spout idealistic nonsense and pretend that the is n't just trying to sell models and toys . <p> I sincerely hate how throughout the Gundam franchise every season gets to the end and the writers start blatantly murdering off awesome characters for the hell of it ! . Rey had finally realized what an idiot he 'd been and that he is his own person and can go make the life he wants , yet he willingly commits suicide with what are essentially the closest thing to parents he 's got . Better yet that Talia even thinking that was the proper way to go instead of sending him off with Kira and Athrun . He could have been an older brother and yet he kills himself after realizing the truth of possibility . Bleh how many more Al LaFlaga clones are there running around anyway at this point ? <p> Thank god , all this SEED DESTINY stuff is finally " OVER " again ... even with this re-mastered crap ... Finally the SEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON SUNRISE or you should really call yourselves SUNSET instead ! ! ! ! <p> Hi guys , I finished watching ep 50 . Anyone can tell if athrun ended up with cagalli ?

" It means a new announcement related to the Gundam series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JST ) , 1:00 am , March 20 ( PST ) . <p> What can you expect for this March 20 announcement ? The long-awaited Gundam : The Origin anime series ? A new OVA series following the very successful Gundam Unicorn , such as Hathaways Flash or Crossbone Gundam ? Yoshiyuki Tominos new anime ( G-Reko or collaboration project with Legacy Effects ) ? Bandai confirmed back in July 2013 that Tominos newest anime work will be released as a part of the 35th anniversary of the Gundam franchise in 2014 to 2015 and the anime adaptation of Gundam : The Origin will be also released around the same time . Info via crunchyroll <p> I went to New York Comi-con last October and st the Sunrise panel they said they HOPE to announce something about The Origin this year as well as to work with Tomino on that or something Gundam in general . <p> Okay , so its a new Gundam show , but still : is n't there going to be any news concerning The Origin ? Is it a post-Unicorn announcement ? Or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Origin ? <p> 35th Anniv , Rise World in Motion .. Seriously Gundam world is boring now . All they do are rehash and reusing old materials . And it 's becoming more predictable lately . <p> I 'm still enjoying Build Fighters , but that 's it . I 'm no longer have interest with whatever they release on market lately . Unlike in 90 ' when there was always something new and exciting in Gundam world . <p> New ? Oh then I wish that it was Gundam Wing Frozen Teardrop ! I think that would be cool way to spark interest in the Gundam Wing series again . Or maybe they will animate the Gundam 00 side manga stories like 00I , 00P , 00F , and the others . <p> Has there actually been ANY official announcement about Origin ? I was under the impression that there has n't been any official announcement for it at all . Maybe it will be the missing RG Ground Gundam , Gouf , GM , and Z'Gok kits ? <p> Everyone here only talks about possible anime release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lead character is downright despicable or Crossbone that are full of HORRIBLE designs and rag-tag CLOWNs <p> And no one even bother to talk about other possible anime titles like Gundam Sentinel , Astray or FROZEN TEARDROP , which are full of SWEET designs and cooler story plots . <p> Gee , I guess everyone here are just TOO GAY and TOO DUMB to explore new possibilites . I do n't think they would even appreciate Tomino 's new G-Reko either . <p> We already know the premise of Origin and G-Recko , those have been hyped and are n't anything really new we are just waiting on release and story information really . <p> I kind of share the opinion of a new non UC Gundam show We have had Unicorn for nearly 5 years and origin will keep that taste going . Since both SEED HD remasters just ended their broadcast if they did well a follow up would be cool . I do share that it should have a new writer though .

But a MG Loto ? I love the kit ( or kits XD ) and all , but I think it was already set . Aside from moving treads , opening ports and of course , better coloring ( no clear visor : ( ) I ca n't think of any reason why Bandai would make one . Unless they decided to prey on the people with the " must collect every unicorn MG ... ! " new year resolution . <p> I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we finally get the long-coveted Wing Zero TV version . I also hope that I 'm wrong and we get both this year , but Bandai 's been dangling that carrot in front of us for years now . Still , a MG Stargazer would be sick , especially if they included effect parts . <p> Ehh not seeing a MG Delta Gundam Kai . More likely its alot of Wing EW suits that are easy to remold like Sandrock Custom Heavyarms . Sazabi 's basically a given . Real Grade might be Ground Gundam b/c of the 08th Blu Ray release . I 'm hoping for a Double Bullet , definitely my favorite from the Age series ( despite its derpy flight mode ) . For Age , they might do the same thing they did with the Strike and sell the Fortress and Orbital as a single pack with one Core Fighter . <p> Dijeh 's still ugly to me . Then again this is the company that made a MG Zaku Minelayer , possibly the most pointless MG of all . Personally , I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable , totally different disigns , tons of remold possibilities to keep UC fans happy . <p> With the upcoming OVA release for 08th MS Team in the end of February I imagine the Ground Gundam would be a realistic expectation for a RG release.Also expecting plenty of Cosmic Era kits with the upcoming Blu-Ray releases and the ' Remaster ' of Seed Destiny coming up . Definitely expecting an RG Unicorn sometime towards the end of this year . <p> As PG 's usually come out in the Holiday season , and the last episode of Gundam Unicorn is coming around November this year ... I would say it is a high probability from a marketing stand point . It would sell very well just because of the last episode and all the excitement surrounding that . I would definitely pay around $200 - $300 for a PG Unicorn : D <p> i havent built a model in like over a year and i still have quite a backlog of models including HGUC Unicorn destroy mode titanium finish and 2 HGUC white dingo gm sniper 2s but i do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a RG rx-79 g comes out ? bandai sure knows how to take my money : / <p> I 'm not saying this as any proof of thing , but just as observations . MG Akatsuki could be relatively easy to produce ( like the GAT kits ) because it seems like it would share the GAT inner frame . A MG Justice might call for a Freedom 2.0 ( or what ever nomenclature Bandai decides to go with ) to have a pair that would look appropriate together because that is what Bandai did with the new GAT kits ; they lead to an updated Strike counterpart to provide a cohesive fleet . I would love a 2.0 Ground Gundam and Ground GM . Though it seems like early era UC kits have been all over the place in terms of design . From the really mechanic OYW RX78 to the cleaner Zeon 2.0s and the really cartoonish RX78 2.0 . All the Unicorn kits look quite cohesive though , and it seems deserving to get a few of those feddy and Zeon grunts . <p> iMHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just make the series as a run-by/filler in the production of wing kits . since wing kits are introduced/produced in between the major release of the current line-up or major gundam movie/tv production . <p> We 'll be getting tons more Destiny releases this year I bet , probably going to do the same thing with the Destiny kits this and next year as they did with Seed , since last year was its 10th anniversary . That makes me feel old -- <p> I want to see somthing new ! I 'm all for the mg list but it just seems more of the same . Getting tired of seeing seed , uc , and wing .

I want a simple MG Wing Gundam Zero that is similar to MG Wing Gundam in terms of proportions . It was a great kit . Stunning because of those wonderful proportions and detail in the wings and weapons . <p> I really like the clean and skinny body with big wings and weapons that the MG Wing Gundam has . I do n't always like the Katoki style small torso and upper body , and long legs . <p> for any1 wondering about the scan of wing zero tv from glory of the LONG ... <p> as for mike I honestly do n't mind . at first I was mad when I saw epyon ew looks a lot like the original epyon so dats bullshit cuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look like LONG ... with dat in mind epyon ew should not be the rival of WZC. but now we can c a wing zero tv ver KA ill buy both as rivals . <p> now dat I said all this I should add this in my predictionMG altron TV ver KA ...... it only makes sense why they have n't released it yet <p> HGUC/MG GP00 and GP04 ! I have no idea on what 's on RG except the RG test pattern , though i wish they made RG GP03s or S gundam , hyaku shiki or rick diaz would be nice.as for MG though unlikely , I 'm still hoping for an MG Double-X , MG Wing zero TV ver is a give away , other EW kits would be unlikely to happen . Sazabi ver Ka is already given 100% . As for Delta Kai , i du n no , but if it does have an MG , i hope his back binders or any other binders would n't have any foil stickers . Not a Destiny fan but some MS there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% on either MG or RG treatment.Mercurius and Vayeate have a very low chance but still has a chance.And probably some AGE would have new kits this year ( I hope not ) <p> Would love to see bandai make a MG Delta gundam since it shares a similar frame with delta plus.I Would n't be surprise t see more seed/seed destiny kits in 2013 since destiny is about to be air . As much as everyone is hating on age kit I still think they may have some new kits for fans of the series . <p> well that will be pricey , the HGUC itself costs like a normal MG. an MG of delta would be like 7000-8000 yen damn.well If BanDai will make MG delta kai , I hope it does n't use delta plus ' mold specially the binders.I agree on your age and destiny predictions no matter how i hate those series , those will be money bags for BanDai.I just hope more UC , wing , and After War kits would be made.probably MG treatment of MSVs , they started on Sinanju stein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wing Zero ( TV ver ) . This may have 80-100% chance o getting MG treatment this year.BanDai has not yet shown any sign of any After War(GX) release , though I hope for an MG double-X , may it be a normal MG or Ver . Ka , I 'll definitely get my hands on that kit . <p> BanDai has already stopped producing any 00 kits and i think they wont release any ( or at least any time soon ) 00 kits.If they 're gon na make kits from 00 , I 'm hoping for an HG sadalsuud type-F.Bandai will probably focus on UC , WING , SEED/Destiny and Age this year . OH GOD I hope Age does n't get that much attention this year.As for PG , WHO KNOWS . <p> I would live to see MG Neo Zeon grunts , especially the Geara Zulu ! Announcing an MG Perfect Strike after the release of the Strike remaster would be a serious kick in the balls to fans who bought the remaster . It would be like Bandai saying " oh you know that kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with way better , and way more stuff ! " <p> Kinda why I am waiting it out first . Especially since there seems to be no significant 1st edition bonus . What some of us here were speculating is that Bandai will release an MG Skygrasper with all the other stuff to make a Perfect Strike which is an awesome idea as getting an MG Perfect Strike AND Skygrasper in a single bundle seems like a stretch . And since this is somewhat done with the RG ( except for the Perfect addition ) , this move does seem to be viable and reasonable . But yea . I do agree . It would suck if they release the Perfect Strike just like that LOLOLOL <p> I ca n't see a MG Akatsuki necessarily coming . The 1/100 NG was already pretty damn good with a great gold finish and compatible with MG Striker packs . There 's not much they could do to improve it except some minor articulation improvements to the legs . <p> The years 2013 and 2014 are loaded with planetary significance because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets-Saturn , Jupiter and Rahu are involved-heir effects will be felt before actual formations and will be in effect even after 2014-15 .

@@35099655 @4099655/ <h> SD BB Senshi 00 Gundam Seven Sword/G - Review by Team GG <p> When I was writing this SD Gundam 00 Seven Sword/G review for gginfinitenews.com , I tried to remember the last time I built a SD kit . It would have been well over a decade ago , maybe even as long as 15 years . What did I remember about them ? Well , they were incredibly easy to build , even more so than NG/HG kits , and had a lot of stickers . After so many years not much has changed . What has changed though is my prospective on the SD kits ... <p> The SD 007S/G is incredibly easy to build and was able to complete the kit while half paying attention to last week 's CSI . Bandai designed the kit in such a way that you can actually pull the pieces out from the runner instead of using cutters or a hobby knife . The traditional ' nub ' we 've grown to love and hate over the years does n't exist . I did n't understand why until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces can just pop right out . <p> In my reviews I try to present the kit as how a proper straight build would look , aka nothing more than some simple nub removal and whatever main stickers are required to ' finish ' the kit . Since this snap out method is new to me I figured I 'd give it a shot . The results , for better or worse , you can see in the photos . All this , though , wraps back to my thoughts regarding SD kits . In my opinion they are both the easiest kits to build , and the hardest . <p> Perhaps I should explain ? SD kits appeal to a very young modeling base . They 're cute , adorable , and very easy to build . No sharp instruments are required , no precision piece fitting . They 're suitable for any age , granted your youngin ' does n't like to eat small things . Stickers are easy to apply and most kits are n't too concerned with fine details . Yet , to achieve those details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SD 007S/G does n't consist of a lot of different pieces . Where a HG or MG kit would feature additional pieces molded in different colors at most you 're offered a set of stickers to help the kit 's appearance . Honestly , I think they look like rubbish . While in a lot of areas Bandai 's sticker methodology has improved , using them to cover large areas , especially when they butt up against each other is n't practical or pretty . To achieve the same color separation and produce an amazing SD kit one is either going to need to tackle the guy with a slue of hand brushed details , immense masking &amp; spraying , or a combination of the two . There are a few folks out there who consistently produce amazing SD kits and their work and skill should never be understated . <p> Thus my main conclusion with regards to SD kits simple , young or old , they 're an unexpected challenge . Wait , should n't my conclusion come at the end of my review ? Perhaps after all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should spout off some info about the kit itself ! <p> The SD 007S/G is built off the previously released SD Gundam 00 Raiser so you will find some residual pieces left unused on the runners after completion . The kit 's stoud nature and solid design means that it 's quite posable in ways the HG or MG is n't ( namely , it does n't have a problem standing up ! ) Unfortunately it lacks elbow or knee joints like many SD kits . The GN engines , like the rest of the kit , are sturdy and stay in place thanks to some nicely snug poly cap joints . The waist armor , though a solid unit , is independent of the hips and torso which I thought was a nice touch . <p> As one would expect the kit comes with the seven sword armament ( though , including the beam sabers , I think there are actually eight ? ) . Of all of this kit 's components the weapons feature the least amount of color separation . Green metallic stickers make up several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allllll sticker .

There is no reason to call the Wing Gundam " Wing Gundam TV Version " , because it is the Wing Gundam , the original . <p> I think it 's a matter of respect , to call the originals by their correct name , and the variations and redesigns the EW , Ka , 2.0 , HD , RM Ver and so on <p> While I do share your point , the " TV ver . " on the kit it 's merely not to confuse builders who got their hands on the MG ver ka before this . I can put the same example for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not needed of the title " OVA ver . " simply because it was easier that way . But since the Ver Ka . was not the original Okawara design , they HAD to put it anyway . Same happens with Unicorn . There is no " novel ver . " or as you would say , the original . Since the novel 's mechanical designs were katoki 's , they just went with the usual ver ka . but when the OVA came , they released it as " OVA ver . " anyway . For people , it is simple to name this kit " TV ver . " just not to confuse other people who say that the ver ka . is the original , because beleive it or not , there are gunpla fans that had not watched the anime series before .

The Gouf Custom was designed primarily for ace pilots preferring a lighter mobile suit that could leap and jump as opposed to the heavy , yet effective MS-09 Dom . The Gouf Custom featured multiple changes to the MS-07B , including the elimination of the awkward five finger 75 mm Vulcan guns , replacing it with a normal manipulator and a wrist mounted 3-barrel 35 mm Machine gun . The coil-like heat rod is replaced with a magnetic grappler wire that connects and disables an enemy with an electric charge rather than damaging them . The grappler wire could also be used as a repelling line that could slow or even halt the descent of a falling Gouf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was modified so that it not only stored the Gouf 's heat sword but is also capable of carrying a 75 mm Vulcan gun , greatly enhancing the mobile suit 's fire power . The armor and capabilities are only changed slightly from the " B " model Gouf but some units had Luna Titanium armor in place of the standard-issue steel material . <p> Profile Images <p> 3-Barrel 35mm Machine Gun <p> The original 5-fingered machine gun left hand was replaced by a normal manipulator hand , and instead a 3-barrel 35mm machine gun could be mounted on the left forearm . This new machine gun had greater effect on more heavily armored machines , and was magazine fed . <p> The 3-Barrel 35mm Machine Gun can be connected to either arms . The targeting lens can be swiweled from the top to the the left side of the gun barrels . <p> Heat Sword Type D III The Gouf Custom is equipped with the latest in the line of Gouf heat swords , a battery powered weapon that uses a superheated blade to increase its slicing abilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sword Type D III is probably my favorite weapon out of the bunch . As it comes painted in a sort of metallic florescent red color , which contrast well with the overall blue of the Gouf Custom . <p> Daggers ( 2X ) The 2 Daggers can be held by both hands in various poses . <p> Gatling Shield ( 2X ) The Gouf Custom was equipped with a new type of shield that contains a powerful 75mm Gatling gun that was drum-and-belt fed . The Gouf Custom could easily discard the shield if its weight proved to be a hindrance when it needed speed and maneuverability . The Gatling Shield is the signature weapons featured in the 08th MS Team OVA series used by the Gouf Custom , piloted by the Zeon 's ace pilot Norris Packard . The concept of the Gatling Shield is faithfully protray in this toy figure , but I am disappointed with how easily the Gatling Shield falls apart when doing almost anything to it . But the inclusion of two Gatling Shields in the package makes up for it , because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesomeness ! <p> Heat Wire The original thick tentacle heat rod , somewhat limited in length , was replaced with a magnetic grappler mounted on a thin cable , allowing the right forearm to store a much greater length of heat wire and giving the weapon a much greater reach . The Heat Wire is can be attached to either arm , and the wire is bendable . <p> The Gouf Custom in action ! <p> Final Comments : <p> The Robot Damshii ( Side MS ) MS-07B-3 Gouf Custom is an excellent figure by design , but is marred by poor execution . However , it is still a very playable action figure , and I am definitely pleased with amount of accessories included . <p> PROS : <p> - Lots of awesome accessories , the inclusion of 2 Gatling Shields is already worth the price of addmission <p> - The figure is pretty articulate ( only if you have the patience of putting back the fallen parts )

Maybe its because I was never part of that 90s crowd and have no nostalgia for it . But yeah I agree some of Gundam designs were nice , especially the EW ones but not WZ custom ( sorry angel wings are just too tacky for me ) . <p> Agreed . and even the Gundams can be pretty dull . they are just as one note as the characters themselves .

The blu-ray extras better include a wad of cash stuffed inside for that price . <p> The Japanese anime industry operates in a ridiculous bizarro world where instead of trying to expand your market and attract new customers with aggressive pricing and marketing , you instead assume that the same dwindling supply of otaku will be your only customer base and produce/price accordingly . This works really well up until your existing customer base shrinks into nothingness , at which point you 're fucked .

Shameful . This is why few in the US anime market want to pay . It 's robbery . I remember DBZ dvds for $30 that had 3 episodes on them . <p> Cost of production has nothing to do with it . They are specialty items design for a specific market . That 's why it 's high . Not production reason . People in Japan that can afford these high prices will pay them . They have no concern about the US market because they can make plenty of money in Japan .

But by all means , if the Japanese consumer is that dumb then they deserve to get shafted . <p> Japanese people renting more than buying is the truth .

They 're not going to release grunt kits for a nearly 20 year old series that 's mostly popular outside the native market . The Japanese do n't care about Wing . I bet they point and laugh at these requests for kits for grunts or the Mercurius and Vayaete , two glorified one note jobber suits . American Gundam fans really need to give it up .

Wanting perfect transformation on a such small HG is just showing that you 're lacking knowledge and experience with model kit . <p> well for what it is and it 's price i 'm kinda glad not bad i might get it usually new models are 15 $ ( 1500-1600 yen ) but this is 1260 yen ( 1300-1200 US$ ) if you can buy it from a store tht gets shipment directly from bandia <p> I have that same HG ZZ from the 90 's and the old HG is actually pretty stable to almost todays HG standards seeing as it came with actual screws for joints . not only does it transform exactly like the MG version , but it 's just as poseable and the proportions are practically correct . <p> You guys . You 're the pretentious ones . You should n't really talk out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify it yourselves . Just saying . <p> Hey , partsforming is a GOOD thing . They are not only very stable and proportionate compared to their fully transforming counterparts , but the elimination of the full transformation gimmick usually ADDS articulation that they would n't have otherwise . Almost all of the fully transforming kits I 've built have been very wonky , to say the least . I think my MG Wing Gundam TV version is the only decent one , and that 's because its transformation so ridiculously simple that a two year old could do it by accident . Compare your fully transforming MG ZZ Gundam or your old 90s HG ZZ to the newer partsforming HGUC ZZ , and then tell me which of the three is better in terms of articulation and stability . Besides , partsformers can still be displayed in both modes , and they still look pretty damn accurate in either mode , so why does it matter what steps you take to get there . It 's not like most people are going to be displaying it mid-transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzz about having a fully transformable model kit , most people will transform it only once and then forget about the transformation.i prefer a solid parts former than a crappy full transformable kit <p> Why the hell people are still bringing ZZ into this argument ? ZZ is a totally different suit with size much larger than Victory . Yes ZZ can transform without parts swapping but that fact is IRRELEVANT at all . And the problem is not whether it can be done or not . The problem is , is it wise to do that ? Just because you can , does n't mean you should <p> Hey , if the much larger Master Grade could n't pull off a full transformation effectively , why the hell would you think the tiny High Grade could do it . It 's gon na be a partsformer . That 's the only smart way to do it . I do n't know why people get so worked up about partsformers . They usually look better in both modes , stand better , move better , and there 's usually not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I said before , they still have all the forms , and they usually still look accurate , so why does it matter what steps you have to take to get it from one mode to the other ? <p> I remember the old Macross 7 kits Bandai released , instead of the complicated transformation , they just made the fighter a separate model included with the battroid as a kit . It 's great that the fighter 's legs does n't get gerwalk legs due to wear&amp;tear but it kinda sucks that the transformation gimmick is totally lost and you ca n't make " in between transformation " dioramas . <p> Since partsforming is in between having a separate model and full transformation , you get the advantage of having sturdier constructs while retaining the tranformation gimmick for some parts . Not a bad deal IMO <p> Do n't worry . I do n't think it 's been officially stated yet whether or not it 'll come with the Hexa head . We only just heard about this kit for the first time yesterday , and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to its release date . Besides , even if the Hexa head is n't included , it 's such a small change to the overall design that if Bandai releases the Victory without it , the Hexa is still sure to follow . The real question is will it come with the DASH Pack ? <p> Not having Hexa head is a deal-breaker and honestly , if they try a full transformation , I 'm staying the hell away . The MG V Gundam was fucking HORRIBLE because of that shit . Partsform away , I 'd rather have a kit that I do n't need to super-glue together to display as an MS. 
@@35099681 @4099681/ <h> 4 comments : <p> ... I do n't get how RDs are scaled . I realize they generally are n't , but I get the impression that it seems like they 're trying to be consistent in scale in two ways : <p> The first is that if they happen to be based on MSs around 18-or-so meters tall in design , they 're just smaller than their 1/144-scaled model counterparts ( such as this Sazabi , or Turn A ) . But if they 're 17-to-16 meters or shorter , they 're taller than their 1/144 counterparts ( sometimes dwarfing plenty of 1/144 models based on 18-to-20m tall MSs , such as Wing Gundam ver . EW ) . <p> And the second way is that they 're basically in scale with each other ( if not close to exact ) if they happen to come from the same anime , whether they be the RX-78 and Zaku II from MSG , Turn A and Turn X , Wing Gundam Zero ( TV or EW ) and Leo , or Nu and Sazabi . <p> So while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my impressions ) , I 'm still grateful about the RD series having some sense of scale , even if I 'm one of the few ( or only ) who gives some care about it . Not enough though , as I keep buying ' em . After all , the RDs look good and have awesome articulation. *shrug* <p> I think other than the exception of those Victory Gundams etc , the stock RX-78-2 is around 18.0m whereas Nu/Sazabi would hit over 20.0m . <p> And I believe the reason they 're in scale with each other could be attributed to frame design for that particular series . For example , the GAT series would have almost the same height . <p> If the RD were more widely available in my country compared to the HGs , I too would purchase more . Only have the Wing Zero Custom and Dann of Thursday RDs but I really love them both . Fun playing figures that looks good . <p> My take is that they 're 1/144 in scale but because they 're action figures , articulation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , movement is hindered by large limbs . <p> Thus they have to redesign a slimmer or smaller limb and as the rescaling goes , the whole suit have to be rescaled too . Which then result in why some units are smaller/bigger than their HGUC counterpart . <p> In this sense , while HG might be true to 1/144 scale of a " real " Sazabi , the RD has the better articulation although both shoul have their proportions right regardless . <p> Wow , RD Sazabi 's more or less the same as the HGUC version . Bigger than a Leo ? Well , considering how towering the Sazabi was against the Nu anyway . I 'd probably buy the Saz as a complement to the Sinanju , if there 's an RD Nightingale , THEN it will give me something else to think about .

Wonder if Reiji 's piloting skill and reflect can do something about weight issue of this pack , or he will do all-out bombardment first then eject the backpack for mobility-oriented fight ? This custom build only suitable on space field and will be obsolete for gravity field because the weight , and I think that amount of booster wo n't help much .... <p> What the personen above me said in the plavsky system there is not the same gravity as in reallife and they are plastic not metal so its hard to say and be honest you would like to be the pilot not the personen from the anime <p> The difference is that anything with gigantic backpacks and boosters in UC are meant to be used in space where balance and aerodynamics or weight are worth bupkis . Not to mention they 're typically customized by adding a metric ton of boosters or fuel tanks to compensate for it . In CE , pretty much everything has a giant backpack as a default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like have huge backpacks . <p> @ Joshua vance , I actually think it will , although this is just completely my opinion I think that the last fight will be reiji/sei vs the meijin and their battle will somehow end in a tie and heavily damaging both their gunplas and since the final match ended in a draw they will likely hold a rematch where meijin will use the exia dark matter and reiji this crazy neo mofo.

@@35099688 @4099688/ <p> Not really . It 's quite the different design compared to SBS . Fenice 's upgrade was drastically different , yes , but SBS was n't that different aesthetically from the BSFP , just a new piece of calf armor on each leg , a new backpack ( that has arms that reach over its shoulders and latch onto the front of chest , giving the illusion of chest vents . Without the backpack , it looks almost exactly like its predecessor from the first few episodes , save for the aforementioned calf armor ) , and a new rifle and shield . <p> if you have n't been reading some of the forums online , the theory why the minimum design upgrade to try burning is due to star winning " gimmick " again . if you have n't noticed , most of its parts look like it can be attached to Burning . probably additional armor . <p> Let 's be honest here . The star build strike gundam was also had minimal upgrade look compared to the build strike full package . But the features is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . Its functionality over aesthetics . I believe that there going to get more into the whole " assimilated " aspect of the show . It seems the more like he is going to have better control overall with the try burning gundam because of added plasky addons to fluidly control it . Like a RG system 2.0 but he can go to the next level with techniques that the burning gundam could not perform because its movements are not at the same level as Sekai . Also it has a G gundam feel to it . There was not alot of difference between the Shining Gundam and the God Gundam but the differences are still there . <p> not really - looks like Star Winning Gundam Transform ability is going from SD to HG. if you look closely where some of the parts connect similar to Winning Gundam you can see that Star Winning has the same connection points . yet the Star backpack is made up of thighs+shins and forearms to extend the gundam height <p> I like the design improvement though , minimal but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for the new techniques Sekai used in the latest episode ( Phoenix Force-Like attack and that Hado .... something2x ) ... it may be a Bandai strategy to sell more but they are good ... I 'll pre-order this ..... : ) I 'm just excited on how well this Gunpla will do on the coming episode .... I hope this upgrade will be the last ... if not .... then it means that I 'll have to buy another : ( <p> You know I like seeing them win : ) i do n't its just that feeling that you want them to .... Although maybe they wo n't ( as they have rivals that are just equally strong if not better ) but remember how the star build strike pawned all its enemies who are all strong by using RG system .... If Sei and Reiji can get away with that ... Sekai and team try fighters might do the same ... : ) ( to be honest i felt really bad when sengoku astray lost to star build ) <p> i like how everyone is complaining about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have n't seen anyone complain about how the lightning only gets a new backpack ! any way my inner 5 year old wants this one cause of all the " fire " it comes with <p> I wish I 'm wrong but like how bandai released the MG build strike and a separate kit for the upgrade universe booster we may as well expect a MG Build burning gundam and a separate kit for the upgrade parts for the try burning gundam =P <p> Was hoping for a totally new unit as an ' upgrade ' but i 'm ok with this modification of parts as the main upgrade . I think it works better in terms of having a much improved regular unit for Kamiki Sekai 's use instead of adapting his skills all over again to a brand new unit . He has form a unique attachment with the Build Burning so starting a new relationship with a new unit wo n't cut it . At least this way he need not start from scratch and can continue developing his relationship with the Burning Gundam and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a lack of so called character development with the gundams used by the owners simply because they keep changing units everytime . Way too many completely redesigned upgrades which i think affected the story a little bit . A prime example of this was the cameo appearance of Build Gundam Mk-II , Aila 's Miss Sazabi and a few other units whose name escapes me . They were simply units stuck there with little to no development so we 're all left wondering what the hell can this units do in the hands of their respective owners . 
@@35099689 @4099689/ <h> Saturday , February 2 , 2013 <p> On Friday , producer Masakazu Ogawa announced on the official Twitter account for Mobile Suit Gundam AGE that production on a new project featuring the characters Asemu Asuno and Zeheart Galette has " finally " been green-lit . Ogawa did not specify what kind of project it is , or even if it is anime . <p> In light of the announcement , designer Michinori Chiba drew a new sketch on a sheet with Japanese animation registration holes . <p> Ogawa had mused in September about a possible story focusing on the characters ' days as students . In November 2012 , Ogawa and Chiba released a rough sketch to the official Twitter account that was used to introduce the characters for a possible new project . <p> In the AGE anime , Asemu was the main character of the second generation with Zeheart as his antagonist . The television series premiered in October of 2011 , and it ended on September 23 , 2012 , shortly before Ogawa mentioned the tentative plans . <p> Age got hit from every angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its character design , MS fans hated it because the suits looked weird , animation buffs hated it because it 's not Unicorn budget , and UC fans hated it because it 's not UC ( lol ) . No matter which way you look at it , Age never stood a chance . <p> Objectively speaking Age is not a horrible show ( especially compared to all the moe/high school crap ) . It started out with good intentions and you can see that in late gen-1 and the beginning of gen-2 . It 's just the writer 's lack of experience juggling different plot threads turned the final arc into a mess even by kids show standards . <p> Sorry , AGE is a horrible show , i went in with a open mind , saw the first 3 episodes , then i saw the fourth , it was horrible . i saw the show with my 12 year old brother and he thought it was horrible aswell , nothing made sense , we saw all episodes and the show only kept getting worse , Gen 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good until they went to space , then the show flat out made no sense anymore . <p> Second moon being able to move to earth on its own accordEzelcant dying happilySid ? Vagan gear ? Kio even mattering ? Girard SprigganHints at rivalty between Zeheart and Monkey Dude . <p> The show is full of plotholes , bad execution , bad story , horrible character development ( girls being vagina machines , nothing else ) , characters disregarded for no reason instead of being reused during the generation skips . <p> Oh , and not to mention the most retarded " Evil " plan in all history . <p> Oh yeah , definitely ! There 's still a huge segment of fans who insist Wing is the best thing since sliced bread . Granted the community 's cooled down quite a bit but you still see many Gundam-related articles/videos being bombarded with comments like " Gundam Wing is the best EVAR ! " <p> what you are saying is impossible . the first three are shit , and you say the latest will suddenly will be good ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three left a really bad impression on lots of people out there . <p> What Age needs most is better writing . Get a more experienced writer to do the script and we get a good series/manga/whatever . <p> But yeah I do question Bandai 's logic of continuing one of their worst commercial failures . Then again it was their idea to turn something which should have been a video game into an anime . Just goes to show some corporate executives have no idea what they 're doing or too blinded by their ego . <p> no wonder they say that the gundam fanbase is the worst . People bashing everything that is not of their favourite series , and creating flame wars of hate and what not on things we are here just to enjoy . So you all , shut your traps and enjoy what was put out ! What a shame that the fans of a show that promotes peace and harmony is the drive for hate wars like this . <p> People go way to far to just bash series they do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch this new one when is it comes out . It 's not necessary for people to get bratty just because you do n't like something . You give rational Gundam Fans a bad name . <p> Totally agree . i quit watching gundam AGE during the kio arc cos i do n't really like it , but i keep my comments to myself instead of bashing the anime in places like here . please be more mature and think before you guys start commenting anywhere . it will help the community better ! = ) <p> So , this is not a wishlist anymore ? You just decide what MGs need to be made now ? I swear , all the crap out of your mouth is either complaints about trivial nitpicky stuff like stickers or what MGs you , in all your greatness , decide that need to be made . And you just run with it and repeat ad nauseum until ppl kick you of every place just because they ca n't stand you anymore and because said places actually become better places after you 're gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZERO about what gunpla or gundam really means , and buy kits because that somehow makes you feel important , and even goes to the point of calling people jealous and blame the hatred you get on jealousy . You should be ashamed of yourself P.S : Now go ahead and play the victim , correct my spelling , make some attempt at humour or be generally arrogant like you always are , just adds to your shame <p> Oh god please shut up already Suiton . Your lists are downright inane , annoying , and unneeded . And for all your blather about what kits they should do you do n't even cover brand new suits that never got kits , like the Khronos and whatever the hell Fram piloted in the last few episodes . They deserve kits more than crap like Age2 Special Forces Custom , which you could have already if you spent less time whining on this blog and more time learning how to paint , which would also produce better looking kits as well . <p> I think the second arc was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skips so it would fit in with the other arcs . This is probably going to be a manga thing or very unlikely a OVA short . No way this is some new series . Age ended , time to more on to something else . #reasonablecomment <p> Instead of Asemu , I wish they did Flit between gen 1 and gen 2 . Flit was so incredibly badass at the end of 1st gen I want to see him in his prime as a soldier piloting the Age-1 Razor ( seriously that thing needs to be animated ! ) .

Asobit City is a chain of hobby related stores owned by the Laox group . There are actually three Asobit City stores in Akiba - one is Asobit Game , the Asobit Hobby near Akihabara station and the Asobit Chara City . <p> The one I went to this time is the Asobit City near the Akihabara Station , a big thanks to Gaijin Gunpla for taking me there . Asobit City is a multi-story building store full of various video games/toys/figures/hobby for your regular Otaku . They have one level solely dedicated to Gunpla &amp; Gundam related merchandises , and another level mostly for hobby supplies . <p> Definitely the place looks quite different than how I thought it looked from Moeyo.com . It was defintely more compact than I thought it would be . But I was amazed at the quality of gunpla kits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very nice diorama too . <p> The latest &amp; greatest are ususally stacked in the middle , so folks can easily grab'em . <p> Asobit City has some of the most beautifully painted gunplas . They even display sample paint schemes describing how to go about painting in various styles . I definitely learned something new there . <p> They have a small workshop where gunpla masters create nice looking gunpla for display . Here they were working on the MG The O. <p> I purchased quite a bit of souvenirs there .... and even got myself some cospa clothing such as this one ... A ZEON windbreaker . Ca n't wait for Fall to come , so I can wear it to show my devotion for the Principality of Zeon .. SEIG ZEON ! ( And yes .... the model below is me . LOL ) <p> The following are photos I had taken way back in May 2006 at another Asobit City in Tokyo .

Whatever I say comes from my heart , not because someone said this , someone said that . <p> First of all I think the concept is great , combining 2 cheesy mechs in to one . Color combination is nice ( although there 's a hint of Force Impulse scheme ) . Painting is ok for me , he might be new at painting/ABing ( nothing a good practice ca n't solve ) . For the signs , its ok , although there 's silvering on them ... I would suggest decals next time . <p> What I do n't like about it ( I 'm not saying hate ) is that there 's too much pla-plating going on . Too much that it 's overwhelming the kit . <p> Why too much you ask ? There 's already a lot of protruding parts plus cut-offed armors to show the inerts ( which is ok for me ) , But the pla-plates just added too much contrast to the kit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorta G-System style look , or it might 've been just his personal preference . I would suggest to take a look at NGT 's style . His mods are n't over the top , but when you look at it ... it just takes your breath away . <p> Remember too much of something is n't always the best thing . Modding a kit is great , but always go with a bit of simplicity on the side . <p> the images are a bit to noisy .... the true beauty is hidden on this kit . You can see the concept however the quality of the kit is not convincing to me. paints stickers and seams are not seen in this picture . would like to see it on person or rather in clear photo to conclude . <p> It 's true everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but to say those kind of things ..... Tut Tut Tut ... <p> First - do n't be some D**k-less chickens and hide behind Anon ... what , too scared for payback ? ? <p> Second - before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level that allows you to do that ..... <p> 3rd - Every heard of Constructive Criticism ? ? ? If not , go and goggle it Douche-bags ... Who knows .. I might even be making you a favor , telling you to learn something that would be useful in your Fricking miserable lives <p> Some of the imperfections can be seen but that does n't take away the creation and time devoted on this build .

@@35099700 @4099700/ <p> As a fan of the TTT and AoZ , I am really awestruck by this new design . It 's like an Arche or Nightingale fused Hazel . <p> I hope that Bandai would release more AoZ kits , like the long awaited Woundwort , as there 's something about AoZ 's design which sets it apart from the rest of the Gundams . Be it the intricate headpieces , crazy armaments , radical Mobile Armor/Fortress designs or the customizable options , the suits actually has a cute/cool/wow factor to me . <p> I really doubt we 'll ever get a HG Woundwort . Its other configurations , maybe , but the Woundwort itself is so small and complex it might only be possible if it will use RG tech - and even then it will probably be a nightmare to build . <p> But I have to admit , I want an Advanced and the Kehaar II , too . Then Bandai should go the whole nine yards and give us the Fiver II/Inle complete with 6 Kehaar IIs . Lol . <p> The sad fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as plamo kits beyond what 's already out , and those are mainly just a supplement tree added to an existing kit . They are available in resin kits , but mind the price , I have found a bargain price means a poor recast . Also Dengeki does n't have the contracts that Hobby Japan does , so no Fix Figuration , no Robot Damashii , those are exclusive to HJ . Maybe we will see more SD like in the Gundam Warrior Next series , but what about Converge or STANDart - so far NADA . Too bad . Chaosdoc <p> Up until now I 'd never seen these designs before but now I want them released more than any other design . The TR-6 Woundwort is like an amazing blend of Zone of the Enders and Gundam stylings ! I pray this reboot leads to a kit being released . <p> While Advance of Zeta is good , I can not help but feel that many of its designs are out of place with Gundam especially taking place only one year after the Delaz conflict . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope to see the Rosette and the Stutzer versions of Zeon MS as future HGUC or MG models . <p> Jesus christ that art style does n't suit UC , or any gundam series for that matter . why the fuck u do dis . It 's like its from a lolicon doujinshi , JESUS FUCKING CHRIST . but hell , that gundam looks fucking awesome , sad that its gon na be piloted by a loli getting ready to be fucked by a mechanical penis . <p> I du n no . AoZ designs keep getting farther and farther away from UC aesthetics . At this point they might as well be an AU . It 's great that they 're diversifying and all , but it gets completely over the top and intricate , and at this point its long stopped resembling much of anything in the official timeline .

Suck BANDAI .. ! ! ! <p> Just like Sentinel , different agency hold copyright for AoZ . We know with TR-series variant and add-on sure bandai can milk every kits of AoZ , but yeah different copyright hold say otherwise , even Sentinel kits stop on pegasus III 's gundams only for MG , and S/Ex-S then Xeku Ein for HGUC ...... <p> Bandai please get on this stuff I do n't just mean the TR-6 kehar II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the RX 78 4 and 5 u see there is profit in these machines but some body has to put forth effort . I write this in hope that master Kawaguchi sees it or any one from bandai at that I hope they see it and take heed that these kits are good not p bandai good but good enough for production I know I look like I 'm asking a lot but hey it 's easier than bringing gundam back into the US am I right

So it means probably another line or maybe new grade to eliminate the grade system maybe ? <p> I am still uncertain about this new line of products.I mean it looks like an improvement over the 1/100 No Grade that just recently came out , but it still does not give me much of what an MG gives off in terms of details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure , even though it apparently is a 1/100 scale model kit . <p> I think I am going to skip this and continue to wait for a Master Grade release.I have not gotten any IBO kits since I have enough Gunpla kits as it is . So I think I can wait at least til 2016 starts to see if Bandai will announce an MG Barbatos.Though in terms of MGs , I suspect we 're going to get a lot from Seed Destiny , maybe something from Build Fighters/Try , and well we all know that Thunderbolt MGs are confirmed which probably is the Full Armor Gundam MG at least which I suspect will either go with the 3.0 or Origins mold . <p> the mace would probably be hard to make unless they include hands like those of high grades , and another factor is that it might be heavy cause likely it will have additional gimmicks and wont be just two pieces of plastic <p> With all the work Bandai put into this , they could 've just released a Master Grade , but we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the recent series none of them have gotten an MG for the lead Mobile Suit ie ( GBFT &amp; Reconguista ) , they 've only been releasing kits that are just rehashes of others or that use runners from previous releases . <p> I 'm not saying i 'm not going to like/buy any of the Thunderbolt MG 's , but they fall in line with what I said about rehashing and re-using runners from other kits , no one can say that The Thunderbolt itself is n't going to re-use some runners from any of the RX-78 releases , most likely the 3.0 . And another perfect example is how the only MG that came out of GBFT was the Amazing Red Warrior which is just the 2.0 with cosmetic changes and different accessories . Again , not that I 'm hating on any MG but the re-hashing is getting old , I ca n't speak for everyone but I know a lot of people are tired of retools and want some of the more original designs . <p> this look more like frame arms ..... they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components ..... just like frame arms .... but still nice looking barbatos , looking forward to this new line ... <p> Paint job and diecast metal is an extra cost . They are not about to just do things like that at no additional cost . If you think about it . Even if it costs Bandai like $40 ( for example ) per diecast metal , paints , etc. think about that $40 and multiply it by the millions they will make . So overall , it could easily rack up the expenses . <p> You guys need to understand that the frame itself is die-cast . This adds a helluvalotta cost to the production . Given the plated parts as well , I think that 16 , 000 JPY is not too bad . My only nitpick is how weird the V-fin looks on this guy . Also , the arm articulation looks somewhat hindered by the shoulder armour not being able to rotate a full 360 degrees . <p> They Really could 've just released a Master Grade for all the work and detail they put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of series there is no MG in sight , unless they can re-use runners from similar designed kits i.e. the Thunderbolt that 's getting an MG release . Now the Barbatos can be added to the list kits not getting an MG release with Build Burning/Try Burning , and the G-Self , which is really odd because the shows doing well enough for them to decide to produce a second season . <p> You seem to fail on what gets Premium Bandai.In order for there to be a Premium Bandai release , it 'd be a variation or a recolor of an existing item.The High Resolution line up is new.Nothing will be Premium Bandai right off the bat.Try to think a little before posting . <p> Hmm , instead of reading the part that matters , you went straight to lecturing me with things I already know . Why are you wasting your time replying to a weeks old comment with such tenacity ? Someone is having a bad day .. aww . <p> Why ca n't Bandai be smart and just do a Master Grade ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 6 forms so Bandai can do some of those via Premium Bandai , Premium Bandai add on kits , or just have small " upgrade " sets like MG Universe Booster . <p> They can do that for Barbatos using Gundam Frame 1 like the No Grade 1/100 . Then they can do a Gundam Frame 2 for Gusion &amp; Gusion Rebake.Then finally a Gundam Frame 3 for Kimaris and Kimaris Trooper.Oh and of course a Graze Frame for all the variations with the Graze and things like Grimgerde . <p> Seriously , Bandai.WTF.Stop screwing around with the 1/100 No Grade kits and I really do n't know why Bandai is bothering to do this overpriced " High Resolution " since to me it looks like basically a Master Grade like 90% of the way there . <p> It does not come with a mace so Bandai can sell it separately and or through another kit . I wish they would make a Master Grade instead for this series . This release is already way too expensive and they decided not to include the mace ? ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gundam Barbatos ! The internal frame is fully assembled ; all you need to do is attach the armor plating . The joints in the frame are strengthened with metal to add durability ; the " Nano-Laminate " armor pieces feature a pearlescent finish . The gold parts are mekki-plated and clear parts in a combination of clear and metallic finishes are provided . This will build up into one stunning , highly posable Gundam--place your order now ! <p> The High-Resolution Model series launches with the Gundam Barbatos !

The inner frames are so plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything extra over the 1/100 no grade IBO stuff . Seriously , there will never be a master grade anything from IBO . <p> I hope Bandai realizes how dumb this will be and just gives us a Master Grade series of kits . I think they should have just made a Metal Build for IBO and a series of MGs for IBO instead of this new High Resolution Model series . I do n't think it will sell too well . 
@@35099702 @4099702/ <p> I 'm not that mad about you suiton but its like what @primescape said you are truly patient , but considering the original suit maybe gouf R35 will likely be the first to be released if bandai will be so kind enough to hear ( your wish ) <p> @Primescape 16 ....... he 's like that anyways wont change a jack . Always and always everything that is related to what he likes all HG release need to have a compulsary 100% MG . Which is y is is now he is known as the infamous MG Suiton rants . Really curious does you really own all the MG and built all of them when u rant so much of y bandai not releasing this not releasing that ? ? yeah this wan is going to be a P-bandai exclusive ?

Maybe we should wait for a GunPla release ? <p> I hope that if we get a Master Grade for the Double X that the G-Falcon is released too ; even if it means an online exclusive which is probably what Bandai is planning to do already because they are now being super evil to non-Japan living people . <p> The Damashii line is non-scale . Though they are close to 1/144 it depends on the figure and accessories . The falcon might be closer to 1/144 scale as there 's no additional accessories other than the fighter itself .

It 's a little ridiculous how much emphasis is being placed on it when the new kit is so well done . If I want a gun blade , Exia pulled it off much better . <p> Note that Both Strike Freedom and Destiny has a good propulsion , and also they both has a good balance in both long range and short range , you ca n't rely on the Beam Arrow too much since it 's kinda complex

Or will the nationals end in a few eps ? <p> Gunpla has become so big till fashion want a collaboration.Ok Mihoshi became a Hollywood star in 7 years.Fellini should be proud . <p> Bandai once again telling girls that gunpla is ok.Gunota grabs the girl , Yuuma fantasizes.Wow , even Sekai gets it ! <p> So in their world even Fighters get their kits ! Its like F1 teams have toy replica of their cars.Hmm , so BearGuyII is not an original in their world ?

@@35099708 @4099708/ <p> The Lightning Zeta is announced for a July release . Ral 's itchy bottom is a recurring joke and comes up usually in the context of love and couples , hinting that Sekai and Fumina will likely get together in the future at some point.There 's no announcement on the Kamiki Burning but there 's no way they 're going to make it P-Bandai exclusive when it 's a main character mecha . <p> I 'm sure you since saw posting this that the OVA was confirmed earlier today . Also , and I 'm not trying to pick a fight or anything but what is your beef with P-Bandai exclusives , you seem to be swinging that possibility around for everything . Did they make something you were really pumped for a P-Bandai exclusive ? <p> Although the final episode was a good one and pretty funny in places they did put too much into one episode . Though I still liked it . <p> Though I did enjoy Try as a whole and for what it stands for . It did suffer some flaws like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor pacing in places , some iffy writing , lazy animation quality , setting , 3 on 3 battle did not really work here and there etc . Hence why I think Try is not as good as Build Fighters and was always going to be difficult to match or topple the original . <p> Though if they do series 3 of Gundam Build Fighters I would like it if they took there time to get it released say for the 40th anniversary of Gundam in 2019 rather than rushing on the back of popularity getting it out next year . <p> Still I prefer Gundam Build Fighters over Try but still think it is a good series . <p> I 'm the opposite , I loved the first GBF but I liked Try more , for me GBFs story went way the hell off the deep end later in the series and I really did think it would have worked better as a more straight played character drama like what BFT went for . My biggest complaint was that the variety in the suits took a colossal hit after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the show . Now I know for a lot of younger peeps who got into Gundam with Seed or even 00 that seems normal but I 've always liked a diverse set of MSs . This last episode seemed to exist in part just to countermand that point so I guess I leave the series with few regrets . <p> I agree though about giving the series room to fully gestate before a third season . <p> Oooooohhhh the irony of Domon Kasshu re appearing as Jun and Kamiki 's master is such a teaser , then sadly no appearance of Iori Sei anywhere to hint at meeting Kamiki as to challenge him to a gunpla battle to test him 1st handSuch a let down -- <p> when i first watched this show i was n't too sure if i would follow it through , as it revolved around the young themes ( more a cca/unicorn fan ) . However i watched the entire season on every day it showed ! <p> the story flow/suspense build-up to each fight/character and not to mention the ultimate lessons learnt in episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the OP/ED songs ! To me anyway . it felt like this was spiderman2 in the whole ole spiderman trilogy . Just had all the right ingredients mixed in . Nice one sunrise , thanks for a year of entertainment ! <p> That was the worst ending , to what is the worst gundam series . Thanks for insulting everyone that watched , and making all the characters look like jerks , and weebs. oh and thanks for making an OVA based on the cast of the bad build fighters , not the good build fighters . i can agree that this series needs to go away . <p> Bandai you screwed up Try really bad . This show has the worst written main character ever . Sekai 's character takes zero effort to write . He does n't do anything , yet he 's So overpowerd . He 's an idiot and people are blind to that fact cuz of his shouting . Not relatable , stupid , noisy and zero teamwork for a team competition . Honestly this is a gundam series where main characters are suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Try are like Fumina and Yuuma abit cuz they glorify sekai as their ace when all he does is punch harder . The animation is terrible and choppy . The best animation is the tryon 3 battle and the first and final episode , everything else is garbage . What kind of story is this ? The story is literally kids going into a competition and win . No twist , nothing saved and nothing learned . Sekai only won cuz he got a world class gunpla . If you want to make a new season you better get rid of Try characters , We do n't want them to return . You Try-hards love sekai only because he ca n't lose and yells and are blind to the fact you like a retarded character . <p> People still do n't realise how bad Try is with its poor choppy animation , lousy writing , unrelateble characters and an idiot as MC of a gundam show . Well this proves people will buy any low quality anime as long it has gundam/gunpla on it . Now sunrise do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can save money on the anime and put it all on gunpla making . After all , people just buy gunpla for characters now and not proper designs . <p> Not that guy , but I got ta say that as if you 're not trying to look cool defending a show that gives the wrong impression of gundam . You should gtfo if you think this is a good show . It does n't even have an original idea . All the the goddamn characters &amp; ideas are from 1st season and this show was not produced by the same guy cuz he did n't want to make another one and Also Bandai forced an unreasonable deadline on them . If you support last minute Naruto Gundam . Then you 're not a gundam fan , you 're just a weeb trying to look cool
