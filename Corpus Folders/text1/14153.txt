It 's the contributions these two local broadcasters make to civic and cultural life here . If you want to understand Chicago , the news and talk shows on 720 WGN-AM are incomparable guides . The TV station has local news programs throughout the day , from pre-dawn to prime time . Both properties are small treasures that live up to their boasts of being " Chicago 's very own .

Their history is compelling , but it 's the future mission of each that 's now in play . Their broadcast work reflects and promotes the unique identity of Chicago as a world-class city .

@@13436007 @2036007/ <h> New baby monitors offer high-tech peace of mind , and questions <p> One night last fall , Victoria Rodriguez , a pediatric hospitalist at the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children 's Hospital of Chicago , was paged from the emergency room for a consultation on a case . An ER doctor had evaluated a 4-week-old infant , and although he could n't find anything wrong with the baby , he hesitated to send the anxious family home . <p> His concern ? During the night , the parents had received an alarm on their phones that the baby 's heart rate and blood-oxygen level were low . The alarm had been triggered by the baby 's high-tech sock , one of a new class of devices that continuously measure babies ' vital signs , but the ER doctor was n't sure how to interpret this information . There is no peer-reviewed research on the accuracy of these devices , and they have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration . " Without having testing for this device , it 's really hard to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new monitors are a far cry from the simple sound monitors that have been a nursery staple for decades . They come in several forms , with wireless electronics integrated into socks , leg bands , buttons , onesies or diaper clips that send data to parents ' smartphones using Bluetooth technology . Some use motion sensors that purport to detect if a baby stops breathing , and others use pulse-oximetry probes , which shine a light through the skin to measure blood-oxygen levels . The devices can be purchased online and at major retailers for $90 to $350 . <p> The monitors track infants ' vital signs , but it 's not clear how accurate this information is or how it should be used by parents and medical providers . In the case Rodriguez was consulted on , she felt she had to recommend that the baby be hospitalized for more testing . After bloodwork , an EKG and 24 hours of heart-rate and oxygen monitoring - none of which revealed problems - the infant was cleared to go home . " The child was completely fine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rodriguez said . <p> Eric Coon , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Utah School of Medicine , has overseen the care of three infants with similar stories in the past few months , all admitted to the hospital from the emergency room after parents reported an alarm from a high-tech baby monitor . In each case , he said , the infants ' hospital stays were " of questionable value , " and he worries that this new class of monitors is causing unnecessary medical interventions . <p> " People think , ' Oh , all you 're doing is getting more data - more data on your child . How could that be bad ? ' " Coon said . But " hospitalization carries a whole host of potential harms to children , " including the risk of hospital-acquired infections and side effects of medical procedures , he said , along with stress and anxiety for the family and the cost of the hospital care . <p> " Every single medical technology has the potential to harm patients , and really the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study it , " Coon said . <p> Parents might assume that a monitor that measures vital signs could prevent their baby from dying of sudden infant death syndrome , or SIDS , but there 's no hard evidence for this . And studies from the 1980s and 1990s of hospital-grade heart-rate and breathing monitors prescribed for home use for babies thought to be at high risk for SIDS found that the monitors did n't reduce babies ' risk of dying of SIDS . These older monitors were more cumbersome - not wireless like the commercial monitors available today - but they collected similar data , and some studies reported that their use increased parental stress and fatigue . <p> In its guidelines on SIDS prevention , the American Academy of Pediatrics says , " Do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS . " <p> Manufacturers do n't claim that new monitors prevent SIDS or other sleep-related deaths , only that they offer " peace of mind " for parents and caregivers . <p> For example , Baby Vida 's website says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your baby sleeps . " The company 's website also states , " The Baby Vida Oxygen Monitor does not prevent SIDS . It is not a medical device . . . . It 's only intended use is to provide additional information to caregivers . " Snuza says its movement monitors , which detect " the slightest of movements , monitoring your baby when sleeping , " provides " peace of mind and supports you when you need it the most . " <p> Because the devices do not claim to be medical equipment , they do not fall under FDA regulation , which requires manufacturers to show that devices are safe , effective and accurate . <p> Christopher Bonafide , a pediatrician at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , says it 's a problem that the new monitors have not been evaluated by the FDA . Bonafide was lead author of an editorial on the monitors that was published in JAMA in January . " There 's no role for any type of home monitoring of healthy infants , and there are further risks with using these sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate they are and we think there could be risks of harm if parents do choose to use them , " he said . FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said that the agency is reviewing Bonafide 's paper . <p> Reiterating what 's in his editorial , Bonafide says that potential risks include burns from the devices ' electronics or other skin damage caused by many hours of wear , but he 's most concerned about indirect harms such as unwarranted medical interventions . Temporary pauses in breathing and periods of low blood oxygen occur occasionally in healthy infants , but if this normal variation triggers an alarm of a home monitor , it could lead to a cascade of unnecessary actions and parental anxiety , as Rodriguez and Coon saw in their patients . <p> Other types of constant monitoring have been shown to be unhelpful and even harmful . For example , the AAP no longer recommends continuous pulse-oximetry monitoring of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis . Studies found that when monitoring detected periods of low blood oxygen , children stayed in the hospital longer , but longer stays did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during an uncomplicated labor was found to increase a woman 's chances of Caesarean delivery - and associated risks - with no health benefit to the baby . " It 's so hard for medical providers not to react to data that is slightly abnormal , and sometimes it 's better that we did n't know it at all , " Coon said . <p> With the new generation of infant monitors , data is being streamed to parents from unregulated devices . " This kind of thing could lead people to try and make a clinical decision from a device that is really more like a toy in the way it 's being regulated , " said David Jamison , co-author of the JAMA editorial and executive director of health devices at the ECRI Institute , a nonprofit organization that reviews medical procedures and devices . The institute will be testing the safety and accuracy of home infant pulse oximeters this year , Jamison said . <p> Owlet , maker of one of the monitors , says it has done internal safety and accuracy testing and plans to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sock pulse oximeter . Jane Putman , the company 's public relations director , said in an email , " A number of our current customers are physicians and healthcare providers , who have expressed support for the product and the information it provides through its continued use with their own children . " She added that " due to innovations developed by Owlet to lessen false alarms , many users will use the Owlet Sock for several months without ever getting a false alarm , greatly reducing the risk of over diagnosis . " Owlet also has an FDA application pending for a medical version of its pulse oximeter , available by prescription , she said . <p> Snuza founder Greg Gallagher said in an email that his company also is working with the FDA on a product that would be available by prescription . A Snuza monitor that detects breathing cessation has been approved as a medical device in Europe . <p> A small , easy-to-use , wireless pulse oximeter could be a welcome improvement over current hospital-grade devices , Bonafide said . " With evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative to those patients who do need monitoring , " he said , though he would recommend their use only for sick infants under the care of a physician , not for routine monitoring of healthy infants . <p> Some pediatricians worry that home use of vital sign monitors might falsely reassure parents about SIDS , defined as a sudden death with unexplained cause during the first year of life , and other sleep-related deaths such as those caused by suffocation . " Parents may become complacent if they are using a monitor and figure that , since the monitor is on the baby , it 's okay to place the baby on her stomach to sleep or to otherwise not follow the safe sleep recommendations , " Rachel Moon , a professor of pediatrics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine , wrote in an email . She was the lead author of the AAP 's policy statement on safe sleep . <p> Moon 's concern has n't been formally studied , but Alexis Dubeif , founder of a 30,000-member Facebook group focused on infant sleep , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , anecdotally , a significant portion of parents who feel that it 's okay to use unsafe sleep practices because they are ' protected ' by their monitoring device , " she wrote in an email . <p> To reduce the risk of SIDS , Bonafide emphasizes proven strategies . " There are things that we know help in terms of prevention of SIDS , like the bare crib and the flat mattress with a tight crib sheet . These are not sexy . These are not smartphone-integrated things , " but they are effective , he said . The AAP also recommends that babies sleep in their parents ' room ( but not in the same bed ) for the first year of life and that parents place babies on their back for sleep , avoid tobacco exposure , breast-feed , offer a pacifier and immunize babies on schedule to reduce the risk of SIDS . <p> Victoria Rodriguez understands the anxiety associated with SIDS .

@@13436037 @2036037/ <p> Former aides to Hillary Clinton expressed a combination of disbelief and outrage over President Donald Trump 's firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday night , suggesting that the move was an attempt by Trump to cover up the ongoing investigation into his campaign 's ties to Russia . <p> Trump fired Comey citing the need for " new leadership " that can restore " public trust and confidence " in the agency . A second , more lengthy letter written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein specifically highlights Comey 's handling of the FBI 's investigation into Clinton 's use of a private email server as secretary of state . <p> But far from elating Clintonworld - which has long argued that Comey mishandled the investigation - the decision opened a floodgate of calls among shocked Democrats across the party for an independent probe into the Trump campaign . <p> " Twilight zone . I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled . But this terrifies me , " Clinton 's former campaign manager Robby Mook wrote on Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how this bodes well for the Russia investigation . " <p> Moving quickly past their surprise , Democrats have responded almost in unison , dismissing the firing of Comey as an attempt to stymie the Russia investigation . Former Clinton aides , Democratic Party officials and lawmakers called the move " Nixonian , " suggesting that it has made the need for an independent probe all the more critical . <p> " Donald Trump 's firing of James Comey is a brazen and disgraceful abuse of power , " Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez , who was a surrogate for Clinton during the campaign , said in a statement . " The fact that the leadership of the Justice Department was complicit in manufacturing this joke of a rationale for Comey 's dismissal at the request of Trump is further evidence that nobody in this Administration can be trusted to lead an honest investigation into a serious national security issue . <p> " It is time for leaders in both parties to come together and call for the appointment of a special prosecutor at the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigation that the American people deserve , " he added . <p> Citing Comey 's actions in the July press conference and leading up to the election as the rationale , Trump is now in the unusual position of firing the FBI director for actions that his critics say made him president . <p> At the same time , Clinton 's allies characterized Trump 's stated rationale as the pretext for a different political motivation . <p> " Really , he 's doing it to get out from under the Russia investigation , " former Clinton aide Brian Fallon said on CNN . " The only thing that can happen now is we need a special counsel inside the Justice Department . " <p> Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , who challenged Clinton in the Democratic primaries , also suggested that the person who replaces Comey at the FBI would not have credibility to continue the Russia investigation . <p> " President Trump has repeatedly taken steps to kill inquiries into Russia 's involvement in the U.S. election , " Sanders said in a statement . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be able to objectively carry out this investigation . <p> " We need an independent investigation into the Trump campaign 's ties to Russia , " he added . <p> Comey 's abrupt dismissal came just hours after the FBI submitted a letter to Congress correcting the director 's testimony during a hearing last week , in which he falsely stated that " hundreds and thousands " of emails from Clinton aide Huma Abedin had been forwarded to her estranged husband Anthony Weiner . In fact , Abedin forwarded only two emails and the remainder were automatically backed up on Weiner 's computer from her Blackberry device . <p> But Rosenstein 's letter - the most detailed of the documents released by the White House about Comey 's dismissal - strongly criticizes the former director for his actions at a July 2016 press conference , where he revealed that Clinton would not be charged with a crime . At the same event chastised Clinton for her handling of classified information , which Rosenstein called a " textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the election telling Congress that the FBI was examining new emails as part of their probe into Clinton server , only to announce more than a week later that they turned out to be immaterial .

It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election , " Comey said . " But honestly , it would n't change the decision . " <p> Clinton 's former aides said that while they agree that Comey acted inappropriately throughout the investigation , Trump 's actions are suspicious . <p> " I think Comey and the FBI mishandled the investigation around the emails from at least July of 2016 on , concluding with the misrepresentation about Huma last week , " Jennifer Palmieri , Clinton 's former communications director , said in an interview on Tuesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the FBI 's investigation of Trump than Clinton .

But just last week , police oversight officials belatedly posted those videos on a city website .

The case sparked furious protests fueled in part by Alvarez 's failure to charge Van Dyke for 13 months after the shooting in spite of the video evidence . <p> The U.S. Department of Justice promptly announced an investigation into the Police Department , and Emanuel pushed through a series of reforms , including the video release policy implemented last June . <p> Though Foxx criticized Alvarez 's handling of the McDonald case during the campaign , she did not endorse Emanuel 's video release policy . <p> " I do n't know if there 's an arbitrary number that you can put on the date when you release the video where it does n't compromise the integrity of your investigation , " Foxx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last year , the city posted numerous videos of police shootings and other violent encounters , and there is no evidence that the courts blocked any of the footage . <p> So far this year , however , the city has released videos within the 90-day limit in just two of the first five police shootings . And neither of those two cases involved criminal charges because both people died of their wounds and the officers have not been accused of wrongdoing . <p> The other three cases involve criminal charges , and court orders have been issued in two of them , delaying the release of the videos and other evidence indefinitely . It is unclear what footage exists in either case or what it might show : <p> At a hearing March 1 , a prosecutor told Judge William Lacy that the city would soon release video and other materials in the fatal off-duty shooting involving then-Officer Lowell Houser , who was charged with the Jan. 2 murder of Jose Nieves . <p> His lawyer , William Fahy , voiced concern about the video becoming public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transcript of the court hearing .

The two had an ongoing feud , prosecutors said , and Houser had brandished a weapon at Nieves , 38 , the month before the shooting . <p> Neither Fahy nor Houser could be reached for comment , but Fahy has defended Houser in court by saying he acted in self-defense after Nieves threatened to shoot him and reached toward his waistband .

Trump called the news media " the enemy of the American People . " <p> The New York Times , which among others was called out specifically , labeled it " a striking escalation " from a leader who " routinely castigates journalists . " <p> Gabriel Sherman , national affairs editor at New York magazine , described it as " full-on dictator speak . " <p> They 're not being pedantic . <p> Enemy of the people is a phrase " typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations , " the New York Times wrote . " It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent . " <p> Where did the expression come from ? In its original incarnation , enemy of the people was n't code for " enemy of my regime . " In one of its earliest uses , the phrase was used to describe a leader himself - Nero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless one to boot . As his country fell into ruin , strained by construction costs and a massive devaluation of the imperial currency , Nero vacationed in Greece . He enjoyed musical performances and theater . He took a chariot to some Olympic Games . He considered whether to build a canal across the Isthmus of Corinth . <p> When he got back home , the political class was angry . And he did n't do himself any favors by ignoring a revolt in Gaul . The Senate grew so infuriated that they declared Nero an enemy of the people and drew up plans for his arrest and execution . Nero took his own life after a failed attempt to flee . <p> The term fell out of fashion among the political class , though it popped up in literature and art . Most famously , Henrik Ibsen wrote an 1882 play called " An Enemy of the People . " It features a doctor who 's almost run out of town because of an article he 's written bashing the government . The idea came to Ibsen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " challenged the hypocrisy of Victorian morality , and was deemed indecent . <p> Adolf Hitler was allegedly an Ibsen fan . ( Some historians say they believe that he read the plays as prophecy of the Third Reich . ) He reportedly read " An Enemy of the People " closely , even weaving some key lines into speeches . His administration deployed this rhetoric to describe Hitler 's main enemy : the Jews . " Each Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people , " Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels wrote in 1941 . " ... If someone wears the Jewish star , he is an enemy of the people . Anyone who deals with him is the same as a Jew and must be treated accordingly .

" In attacking them , both appealed to the people . " <p> Chinese dictator Mao Zedong deployed the phrase against people critical of his policies and dictates .

" <p> For many Americans , affronted by the imminent repeal of the Affordable Care Act and other radical changes in the political wind , that feels like an apt description of the moment . Fornes , though , was writing in 1990 , on the occasion of her directing one of her own plays , " And What of the Night ? , " at the Trinity Repertory Company in Rhode Island . Actually four plays , all themed around poverty , Fornes ' project was inspired , she said at the time , by her exasperation at the number of people in dire circumstances she was seeing on the streets .

Fornes ' fans often make the case that she has been overlooked and , in fact , is among the most important female American playwrights of the 20th century . Some say the most important . Maybe so " for example , you can see similarities here with " Angels in America , " albeit minus the humor . <p> Fornes scholars generally have seen " What of the Night ?

Then we get a meditation on " Lust , " careening from 1968 to 1983 and , finally , a piece set in a dystopian , impoverished future , after America has pretty much gone to hell in a handbasket and the streets fill with starvation . <p> Survival or not , the overwhelming feeling that emerges from Murillo 's production is one of depression . <p> Consciously or not , the production foregrounds sexuality , a constant presence in Fornes ' work and , for sure , an indication of a spirited life persisting . But thanks to some remarkable work by such actors as Kate Black-Spence and Allyce Torres , you come away from this show overwhelmed by how ripe sexual expression is for exploitation .

And so it here feels . <p> Not everything Murillo tries works " some of the scenes are overpushed , reside on the surface or remain emblematic . But this is nonetheless a deeply considered staging , an often-successful attempt to embrace the epic in a studio on Belmont Avenue and to tie these plays together with a cinematic sense of chronology and inevitability . Some of the scenes of human trafficking " which is what it feels like you are watching to various degrees " will disturb you greatly . For sure , Murillo 's clearly committed cast achieves the collective aura of frailty , which is most crucial to this piece .

The only other named character is a representation of the playwright 's lovable father , Larry Yee ( the ebullient and compelling Francis Jue ) .

On the other hand , as she acknowledges , the great family associations were founded by oppressed immigrants as a means of survival . American history teaches us that immigrant groups have always needed solidarity and assembly to challenge dominant power structures . So not only are these clubs important records of the history of the Chinese in the historically hostile United States , they also were a means of survival and emancipation .

I 'd also argue " and this is my age talking " that plays like this from young writers tend to be overly optimistic about having it all ( the life beyond , plus the deep connection to the community of our birth and nurturing ) , when later life often reveals how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or its metaphoric equivalent . Far from those who love us . For then we come to see that their lives are finite , and many of our cultural or political worries then drop away . <p> There is enough here to admire Yee as a writer " her honesty , her ability to poke fun at herself and those for whom she cares , her frankness , the freshness of her voice about a world that so often does not get a place at the theatrical table . But I still prefer the work when the playwright really let 's her characters talk . I 'm including Yee herself in that : She 's fascinating as a character . The Lauren in the play just has to talk so much about the doing of the writing , which , from the perspective of the audience , sets you off looking for the play you 've come to see .

It 's indicative of how important a voice Yee surely will be .

@@13436180 @2036180/ <p> Proposed changes by Chicago police to its policy on use of force fail to spell out that deadly force should be a last resort and fall short of other key goals such as limiting Taser use and improving transparency , two leading police reform experts say . <p> In comments submitted to the department Monday , Sheila Bedi , a professor with Northwestern University 's MacArthur Justice Center , and Craig Futterman , a law professor at the University of Chicago , said the overhaul does n't go far enough in spelling out clearly when officers can use force , particularly deadly force . <p> The policy should begin with the premise that physical encounters with civilians are appropriate only when there is probable cause for arrest or a public safety emergency , Futterman and Bedi said .

The district has filed a lawsuit in Cook County court to get more money from Springfield . <p> Then CTU President Karen Lewis chipped in : She threatened a one-day teachers strike on May 1 to draw attention to the " acute crisis " facing the district . " If the board goes ahead with the threat of canceling three weeks of school , we would view their action as a massive violation of our contract , " Lewis says . " And that could provoke a strike . " <p> And there 's a third threat in the air that would shortchange those students . The union urges members to clock in and out exactly on time March 20-24 . No coming in early , or staying late , to help kids understand their lessons . The CTU leadership 's point is to protest a district initiative that would increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " We know this will be difficult for many of you , who put your students first , but please consider the powerful message it will send , highlighting to the world how much we do for our students on a voluntary basis , " union leaders wrote to teachers . <p> Students who need that extra time with their teachers ? Sorry , kids , you 're out of luck . <p> Cheating children of instructional time via the possible union actions or the district 's threat to end the school year early would be enormously destructive . Teachers and district officials ca n't build on rising graduation rates and academic test scores if children are n't in class . Keeping kids home , forcing parents to scramble for other arrangements , does n't generate trust in CPS " or deliver a superior education . These are the kinds of bad ideas that help parents decide whether to stick with CPS or switch to other schools . <p> For CTU there 's inconvenient history here : Last April , union members threw a tantrum over stalled contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest . After that , Lewis wrote to district negotiators promising that the union would not engage in a similar strike unless it " came after the conclusion of the impasse procedures and following statutory notices required under the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act . " <p> Scott Stantis <p> Scott Stantis <p> Would n't a May 1 Tantrum Day break that promise ? " In desperate times , we look for desperate measures , " Sharkey says . " This is a desperate time for public schools . And we 're all trying to figure out what we can do to fight this crisis . " <p> Yes , a one-day walkout would let teachers don their bright red union T-shirts , rally downtown and vent frustration at the sorry state of school finances . They 'd also lose a day 's pay , saving the district an estimated $10 million . " Some people will say , ' Well , if you strike , wo n't you be losing another day of pay ? ' " Lewis says . " But I would say if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they threaten us with furloughs and school closures , if we cower under the covers , then we are never going to stop these fights . " <p> There are many better ways for Chicago teachers to fight back , to express their anger at the district 's bungled finances and its threat to close the schools early . The teachers can rally on weekends . They can rally before school . They can rally after school . Instead of devoting so much energy to cheating students , they could send lobbyists to Springfield to help the district argue its case for more money . <p> Similarly , district officials ca n't rely on hypothetical funds to balance the budget . With fewer students should come fewer schools . And even more central office cuts . <p> Ask most Chicagoans what they want to happen and here 's what we think they 'd say : <p> School stays open . Teachers and students show up . Nothing less , whether suggested by a union official or a district leader , should ever be tolerated .

But the vitriolic outrage over the alleged plan to assassinate Kim last month is also being doled out with an unusually big dollop of retaliation threats , raising a familiar question : What on Earth is going on in Pyongyang ? <p> North Korea 's state-run media announced Sunday that an ethnic Korean man with U.S. citizenship was " intercepted " two days ago by authorities for unspecified hostile acts against the country .

Follow-up stories on the plot have focused on outraged North Koreans demanding revenge . <p> It 's anyone 's guess what a " Korean-style " attack might entail . <p> North Korea is known for its loud and belligerent rhetoric in the face of what it deems to be threats to its leadership , and the reference to ferreting out anyone involved in the plot could suggest not only action abroad but possible purges or crackdowns at home . <p> " I wonder if Kim Jong Un has become paranoid about the influence Americans are having on North Koreans , and about the possibility of U.S. action against him , " said Bruce Bennett , a senior defense analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Kim increase his internal purges of North Korean elites ?

Pyongyang denies involvement , but has praised the hackers . <p> The North 's claims of a plot to kill Kim Jong Un with a biochemical agent also have an eerie similarity to the assassination of his estranged half brother , Kim Jong Nam , at an airport lobby in Malaysia in February . <p> In that attack , seen by many as orchestrated by the North , two young women who were allegedly tricked into thinking they were taking part in a television game show , rubbed the deadly VX nerve agent onto the face of the unsuspecting victim , who died soon after . 
@@13436189 @2036189/ <p> In an attempt to overcome unprecedented budget gridlock in Springfield , University of Illinois trustees Thursday backed a quid pro quo deal that would secure funding for the university 's three campuses . <p> The proposal would guarantee state funding for the next five years , starting with $662 million this coming year . In exchange , the university would commit to enrolling a minimum threshold of in-state undergraduates , increasing financial aid and limiting tuition increases to the rate of inflation . <p> State Sen.

There is still no agreement on funding for 2017 . <p> While smaller public universities in the state have suffered most from the uncertainty , U. of I. is reaching a breaking point , Killeen said .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's commitment to world affairs . " <p> Delattre said he " underscored this point " in a White House lunch with President Trump , when the president met with members of the U.N .

The parties to the agreement are expected to increase their ambitions over time , with the goal of eventually setting the world on a course to limit global warming to " well below " a 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) rise over temperatures seen in the late 1800s . <p> The Obama administration pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below their 2005 levels by the year 2025 -- less than 10 years from now .

" The groups argue that the U.S. might consider withdrawing from the United Nations ' Framework Convention on Climate Change , a 1992 Senate-ratified treaty that is the foundation for subsequent United Nations climate deliberations , including the Paris agreement . <p> Meanwhile , Google , Apple , and more than 20 other firms took out an ad in the New York Times Monday throwing their support behind the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agreement generates jobs and economic growth , " the companies ' letter says .

But one thing that really matters for workers has been stubbornly absent : strong wage growth . <p> The pay that workers take home has risen a little since the depths of the recession , but not much . Once you factor in inflation , wages growth is so low that workers are hardly better off than they were a year ago . Over the past year , average hourly earnings have risen just 2.5 percent , according to Friday 's report on April job growth . <p> The trend is disappointing " and somewhat surprising . Given strong job growth and low unemployment , many economists had been expecting that wages would be rising faster by now . <p> As the economy continues to heat up and companies create more job opportunities , employers should eventually have a harder time finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , companies in theory have to start offering pay increases . <p> But in practice , wage growth has remained relatively sluggish . As Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group pointed out Friday on American Public Media 's " Marketplace , " 2.5 percent is precisely the same wage growth seen in 2009 , when the jobless rate stood at 10 percent " twice the current level . <p> Current wage growth " is not what we would expect at this point in a recovery , " said Tara Sinclair , an economist at George Washington University and a senior fellow at jobs site Indeed . " We would think employers would be competing with each other and that we would see that competition reflected in wages . " <p> No one knows precisely why wage growth has lagged behind , but economists have a few explanations . <p> Too many people left on the sidelines : Since the recession , the unemployment rate has not been a great indicator of how much slack is left in the labor market . <p> That 's because the unemployment rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts only workers who do not have a job but are still actively looking for one . Economists argue that the harsh conditions of the recession persuaded many Americans to give up looking for work altogether . Young people moved back in with their parents , workers went on disability and older employees opted for early retirement . <p> Some of those people have gradually started looking for jobs again as the economy has heated up . But sluggish wage growth may imply that a lot of these people are still left on the sidelines of the economy , and that they might be willing to start looking for work again as their prospects improve . <p> Elise Gould , a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute , said that relatively sluggish wage growth " tells us that there 's still a fair amount of slack left in the labor market . The unemployment rate is missing part of the story of workers continuing to be sidelined . " <p> Gould points to the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers , which measures the proportion of the population between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . That figure stood at 78.6 percent in April , still significantly below where it was in 2007 and for most of 2008 . <p> " We have recovered a fair amount , but we still have a way to go , " Gould said . " If there was less slack , then employers would have to be offering better pay to attract and retain the workers they want , and they just do n't have to yet . " <p> We 're not getting much more productive : Other economists find different reasons for lagging wage growth . One is that gains in productivity " a measure of how much a given worker or machine can produce " have also been sluggish of late . That is a worrying sign , since productivity gains are what really determines improvements in wealth and living standards over generations . <p> But blaming productivity for slow wages is not a full explanation , because economists in turn debate the reasons behind sluggish productivity . Some fault measurement issues . Some point a finger at government policies that have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just be because of natural ebbs and flows in innovation . <p> If slow wage growth is tied to productivity , it 's more important than ever that the Trump administration implement policies that boost it , said Jeremy Lawson , chief economist at Standard Life Investments . Yet Lawson said the policies the administration is focused on will not do the trick . <p> " The repeal of Obamacare , tax cuts , changes in trade policy " on net these things are not going to alter the longer-term trajectory of the economy , " he said . " You need a lot more investment in infrastructure . ... I also think it 's important there be further trade liberalization , not less . " <p> In addition to trends in productivity , weak growth in wages may reflect the difficulty workers have asserting their bargaining position in the current environment , Lawson said . <p> A dramatic decline in unionization in recent decades has left workers less able to bargain with company owners for pay increases . At the same time , globalization has allowed companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too expensive in one location , companies can just move . <p> So what does that mean for the Federal Reserve ? Gould and other labor-friendly economists see these trends as ample reason for the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising interest rates . <p> But other analysts see the threat of emerging inflation as a bigger risk , and believe the Fed should act now to raise interest rates to more normal levels . <p> The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate in March for just the third time since the financial crisis , and it has said it plans two more hikes this year if the economy holds steady . Higher interest rates raise the cost of borrowing and thus tend to slow economic activity . An interest rate that is too low , however , can stoke inflation and speculative bubbles in stocks or the housing market . <p> The Fed keeps a close watch on wages for two reasons , Sinclair said . If wages go up dramatically , employers end up passing on some of that cost in terms of prices . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with keeping in check . <p> Wages also tell the Federal Reserve how many unemployed and underemployed workers are still in the labor market . Once the labor market gets really tight , efforts to stimulate the economy do n't translate into job growth anymore " they just raise wages and prices , Sinclair said . That 's a signal to the Fed to cut back on the stimulus it provides the economy through lower interest rates . <p> Sinclair said current market signs are signaling the Fed that the economy still might have substantial room to grow . <p> " It makes me want to encourage the Fed not to rush , because there does n't seem to be too much pressure on the wage cost side for employers yet , " she said . " Waiting a little longer might allow us to see further improvements for people . "

The pier originally had- a docking place for frieghters , passenger boats and an indoor and outdoor space for recreation for the public . By- 1927 , the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in- World War I.- Navy Pier was redesigned in 1995 and became a retail , dining , and entertainment hotspot . It is one of the most visited attractions in the Midwest . <p> Please join its alumni in a chorus or two of alma mater in honor of Navy Pier 's slapdash repurposing 70 years ago as a poor outpost of the University of Illinois .

" Like its hero , Pirsig studied ancient Greek philosophy at the University of Chicago while teaching freshman English at " Harvard on the Rocks , " as it was dubbed . <p> " The top high-school students had been skimmed off to the Champaign and Urbana campuses and almost all the students he taught were a solid monotonous C , " Pirsig wrote . " When their papers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them . " <p> Chicago Tribune historical photo <p> Chicago Tribune historical photo <p> Pirsig was seeking enlightenment ; his students were looking for a meal ticket . From blue-collar families , they hoped to move into the middle class by studying accounting , pre-law and pre-med . Navy Pier offered the first two years of an undergraduate program . <p> Some alumni went even further in life . <p> Jim Thompson became governor of Illinois . Bill Russo was an arranger for Stan Kenton 's jazz band and wrote classical music for symphony orchestras . Jerry Orbach starred on Broadway and in the television series " Law &amp; Order . " John Chancellor was a TV anchorman for NBC . <p> Still , the muse of verse could scarcely hear herself think on Navy Pier . " We have to get out of here , " one student told the Tribune in 1959 . " It 's like reading poetry in a shooting gallery . " <p> The pier was a working dock for cargo vessels that banged up against its classrooms . Cranes loaded and unloaded merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against exhibition halls hosting trade shows . It was hardly an ivory tower , the Tribune noted under a 1960 headline : " Pier Students Have Peace Of A Freight Yard . " <p> Indeed , the ships got there long before the students did . Originally known as Municipal Pier , it opened in 1916 as a combination warehouse and entertainment venue . Renamed Navy Pier in 1927 , it was taken over by the U.S. Navy as a training center during World War II . <p> Toward the end of that war , the U.S. government rewarded veterans for their service with the GI Bill of Rights . Among other benefits , it provided educational funds that transformed higher education , making a college degree far more widely attainable . Realizing they would be besieged with applications , University of Illinois officials opened what was to be a temporary branch in Chicago in 1946 . Its enrollment was pegged to about 4,000 . Some 75 percent were veterans " eager to make up for lost time . The student counseling office reported " the serious mindedness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher grade average . " <p> All were commuters , and many had part-time jobs . Hilbert Wever worked weekend shifts as a fireman on the Northwestern Railroad . A former Seabee , he took business administration classes weekdays and was president of the student council . <p> Many students were from immigrant families . A physics professor told the Tribune in 1960 about the advantage one study group enjoyed . They could read the scientific literature more widely than native-born students : " One of them , Anatol Kuczura , 27 , of 1217 N. Wolcott Ave . is a native of Byelorussia in the Soviet Union and speaks Russian . Another member , Ramadan Shaafi , 23 , of 1417 N. Dearborn St. , speaks Arabic .

To finish their degrees , they had to either transfer to a private college in Chicago , where tuition was higher , or go to the main campus in Champaign-Urbana , where job opportunities were fewer . Wever 's solution was to take a leave of absence from the railroad while he finished his course work " downstate , " as pier students called the university 's main campus . <p> So students and faculty agitated for a full university " hopefully with a grassy , tree-lined campus . Theirs was showing its age , as Wayne Klatt noted in a 1960 letter to the editor of the Tribune : " We students at the U. of I. branch at Navy Pier are shoved into a warehouse that stinks of dead fish in the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to bring jackets to class , " he wrote . " Are we to take a back seat to politics and pigeons ? " <p> In fact , the thorny question of where its replacement should be built prolonged the life of Navy Pier as an institution of higher learning . Some favored a suburban location . Others argued for a Chicago location , accessible by public transportation and offering job possibilities . Finally Mayor Richard J. Daley decreed it would be in the heart of the city , where several expressways would meet " hence its name , Chicago Circle Campus . <p> That provoked a painful struggle with residents of the Taylor Street neighborhood , a tight-knit largely Italian community , who feared losing their homes to a bulldozer . The Tribune reported an incident " in which a dummy with a dagger in the back was thrown from a speeding car in front of the mayor 's home .

@@13436275 @2036275/ <p> President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor , President Barack Obama , of an act that could have gotten the past president impeached . That 's not your ordinary exercise of free speech . If the accusation were true , and Obama did order a warrantless wiretap of Trump during the campaign , the scandal would be of Watergate-level proportions . <p> But if the allegation is not true and is unsupported by evidence , that too should be a scandal on a major scale . This is the kind of accusation that , taken as part of a broader course of conduct , could get the current president impeached . We should n't care that the allegation was made early on a Saturday morning on Twitter . That 's when Trump wrote : " How low has President ) guy ! " <p> The basic premise of the First Amendment is that truth should defeat her opposite number . " Let her and Falsehood grapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter ? " <p> But this rather optimistic adage accounts only for speech and debate between citizens . It does n't apply to accusations made by the government . Those are something altogether different . <p> In a rule-of-law society , government allegations of criminal activity must be followed by proof and prosecution . If not , the government is ruling by innuendo . <p> Shadowy dictatorships can do that because there is no need for proof . Democracies ca n't . <p> Thus , an accusation by a president is n't like an accusation leveled by one private citizen against another . It 's about more than factual truth or carelessness . <p> The government 's special responsibility has two bases . One is that you ca n't sue the government for false and defamatory speech . If I accused Obama of wiretapping my phone , he could sue me for libel . If my statement was knowingly false , I 'd have to pay up . On the other hand , if the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his official capacity . And a private libel suit mostly likely would n't go anywhere against a sitting president " for good reason , because the president should n't be encumbered by lawsuits while in office . <p> The second reason the government has to be careful about making unprovable allegations is that its bully pulpit is greater than any other . True , as an ex-president , Obama can defend himself publicly and has plenty of access to the news media . But even he does n't have the audience that Trump now has . And essentially any other citizen would have far less capacity to mount a defense than Obama . <p> For these reasons , it 's a mistake to say simply that Trump 's accusation against Obama is protected by the First Amendment . <p> False and defamatory speech is n't protected by the First Amendment . <p> And an allegation of potentially criminal misconduct made without evidence is itself a form of serious misconduct by the government official who makes it . <p> When candidate Trump said Hillary Clinton was a criminal who belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . And the suit might not have succeeded , because Trump could have said he was making a political argument rather than an allegation of fact . <p> But when President Trump accuses Obama of an act that would have been impeachable and possibly criminal , that 's something much more serious than libel . If it is n't true or provable , it 's misconduct by the highest official of the executive branch . <p> How is such misconduct by an official to be addressed ? There 's a common-law tort of malicious prosecution , but that probably does n't apply when the government official has no intention to prosecute . <p> The answer is that the constitutional remedy for presidential misconduct is impeachment . <p> Erik S.

The president has no such legal authority . Only a court can order a domestic wiretap , and that only after a showing of probable cause by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . <p> Breaking the law by tapping Trump 's phones would have been an abuse of executive power that implicated the democratic process itself . Impeachment is the remedy for such a serious abuse of the executive office . <p> That includes abuse of office in the form of serious accusations against political opponents if they turn out to be false and made without evidence . These , too , deform the democratic process . <p> The Constitution speaks of impeachment for " high crimes and misdemeanors .

This is n't the place for a detailed analysis . <p> Suffice it to say that what makes crimes " high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . That 's exactly what accusations by the executive are : actions that take on their distinctive meaning because they are made by government officials . <p> What 's more , government acts that distort and undercut the democratic process are especially serious and worthy of impeachment . The Watergate break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters was part of an effort to steal the 1972 election . A wiretap of Trump 's campaign would 've had political implications . <p> And accusing the past Democratic president of an impeachable offense is every bit as harmful to democracy , assuming it is n't true . Obama is the best-known and most popular Democrat in the country . The effect of attacking him is n't just to weaken him personally , but to weaken the political opposition to Trump 's administration . <p> Given how great the executive 's power is , accusations by the president ca n't be treated asymmetrically .

@@13436279 @2036279/ <p> The Chicago Police Department , pressured by a U.S. Justice Department investigation and public outrage over police misconduct , has unveiled proposed policy changes aimed at cutting down on the kinds of controversial uses of force that have plagued the city . <p> The draft policies released Friday would further limit when officers can shoot fleeing people , restrict the number of times officers can Taser arrestees and compel officers to use the lightest force possible in any situation . The draft rules would expand on guidelines now in effect , some of which are comparatively vague . <p> The proposed changes are the latest aftershock of the court-ordered release in November of video of white Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting African-American teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times . The video " showing Van Dyke shooting McDonald as he walked away from officers with a knife in his hand " touched off sustained protests fueled by decades of frustration among many black Chicagoans over use of force and the failure to discipline officers . <p> The Justice Department is investigating whether Chicago police have systematically abused citizens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discipline aimed at getting ahead of reforms that federal authorities might seek . <p> The mayor is in a tight political spot ; he 's proposed changes to a Police Department with a long history of scandal , but he 's also contending with surging gun violence seen widely as a consequence of police ratcheting back their aggressiveness to avoid criticism or punishment . <p> Experts lauded the proposed changes but noted that other police departments have been making similar reforms for years while Chicago has endured a string of policing scandals and racked up tens of millions of dollars in lawsuits over alleged police abuse . <p> " Welcome to the 21st century , " said Geoffrey Alpert , a professor of criminal justice at the University of South Carolina . " This is a step in the right direction . Good for them . It 's just a day late and millions of dollars short . " <p> It remains unclear what version of the rules will ultimately take effect , and the department has provided itself room to change course if any of the proposals prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hinge in part on the success of promised improvements to the city 's frequently ineffective police disciplinary system . <p> The policies would tighten the rules on shooting fleeing people , holding that officers ca n't shoot unless that person poses an " immediate threat . " The current rules allow an officer to fire on anyone who has committed or attempted a felony using force , and experts said the new rules would go beyond U.S. Supreme Court case law . <p> The department also would ban officers from triggering more than three shocks from their Tasers before trying something else . <p> Dovetailing with the department 's new training on defusing tense incidents , officers also would be compelled to turn to " force mitigation " and wait out or move further from potentially violent people . Officers also would be called on to immediately seek medical aid for people injured by police and " comport themselves in a manner that conveys the gravity of any use of force .

Tightening the rules would give the city 's disciplinary authorities greater leeway to suspend or fire officers after shootings " a step the city has rarely taken . <p> The new policies prominently state that the department 's rules are stricter than Supreme Court case law on police uses of force , specifying that officers use the lightest necessary force when attempts to defuse the situation fail . Mandatory de-escalation training started last month for all department officers . <p> The draft rules hold that an officer must intervene if another officer is wrongly using force .

In the McDonald shooting , numerous officers stood by as Van Dyke fired again and again , and the department has moved to fire several officers whose reports clashed with the account captured on the video . <p> Chuck Wexler , the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum , credited the draft rules for adopting widely accepted best practices . He called the proposed policy " impressive and state of the art . " <p> Alpert , however , said departments have been going beyond " the minimal Constitutional floor " in their use of force rules for decades . He said other cities have adopted new force rules because of forward-thinking leadership " or because they were forced to change by federal authorities investigating past abuses . <p> " This is something Chicago should have done years ago , " Alpert said .

There 's a whiff of Ian McEwan 's " Atonement " to Barnes ' story , which similarly deals with the consequences of an ill-advised act of youthful spite , the difficulty of making amends , and above all the tidy , comforting narratives we spin for ourselves in an attempt to supply clarity , meaning and closure where none exists .

@@13436303 @2036303/ <p> If being a Wall Street banker does n't seem conducive to a life of stillness , solitude and meditation " if the concept of selflessness , in all its implications , seems foreign to the ethos of New York City " then the course of " The Yoga of Max 's Discontent , " by the Indian-American novelist Karan Bajaj , will seem natural , if not inevitable . <p> In the novel , Max Pzoras is a young corporate type whose current guise " " with his Borrelli shirt and Ferragamo shoes " " obscures his hardscrabble past in housing project in the Bronx . But when his mother dies of cancer and he finds himself on the verge of killing a homeless man , Max sets off for the Indian Himalayas , and later for an ashram in the country 's south , in search of his true spiritual path . Along the way , he endures tremendous physical tests , including extreme cold in the mountains and extreme heat , drought and near-starvation in the desert . <p> It 's a trajectory that the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born and raised in the Himalayas and later spent time in an ashram . The author of two best-selling novels in India " he moved to the United States in 2010 " Bajaj describes himself as a " striving yogi , " one whose karma , or " innate tendency , " is toward shedding the layers of his identity even as he lives and works in the very stronghold of American capitalism that is New York City . Printers Row caught up with Bajaj , 36 , for a phone interview from his home in Brooklyn . Here 's an edited transcript of our chat . <p> Q : There seems to be an inverse relationship between your movements and Max 's . You grew up in India and moved to New York ; he grew up in New York and travels to India . That 's not coincidental , I assume . <p> Karan Bajaj photo <p> Author Karan Bajaj on his sabbatical in 2012 . <p> Author Karan Bajaj on his sabbatical in 2012 . ( Karan Bajaj photo ) <p> A : No , not coincidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks the same questions I may have had over the years . So the book is , you might say , emotionally autobiographical , although not physically autobiographical . We have this concept in Sanskrit called karma , which is the innate tendency of every being . So in a sense , what he ends up experiencing is in relation to his innate tendency , which is to serve and live in nature in the mountains . That 's his conclusion . And I think my own conclusion , my karma , is not the same . I do have a creative side , but I do n't have his tendency to leave the world behind . <p> Q : You describe yourself as a " striving yogi , " and I would think that New York City would give you plenty to strive against , especially in terms of its materialism . Certainly it would n't seem like the obvious place to go and seek the deeper meaning of life . <p> A : I think Max is striving to lose all sense of identity , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am trying to be just a medium for my work . I do try to lose ownership , so to speak , in terms of the outcomes of the work . I do this " four-one-four-one " model where I work four years , then take a year off , work four years and take another year off . And during that year off I 'm consciously relinquishing my goals and living in nothingness " in a pretty austere environment in India or the Himalayas . So I do need that time away from the commercialism of New York City in order to connect . But I always have this tendency to come back . <p> Q : What exactly is a yogi , and what does it mean that you are a " striving " one ? <p> A : A yogi is a man or woman who is on a quest to dissolve his ( or her ) sense of self " all notions of individual identity " and become almost one with the universe . In practical terms , a " striving " yogi is someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely focusing on the action and not on the outcomes of the action at all . An example would be using work as a medium to express ( an ) innate tendency . I think of myself as a striving yogi because I do feel that my innate tendency is a mix of business and creativity through which I 'm expressing myself and losing all sense of the outcome of the action . <p> Q : On your website , you address the concept of entrepreneurship ; you offer a method of determining whether a person should or should not be an entrepreneur . I suppose we would have to say that you are an entrepreneur of a kind , in the sense that you create a product " your books , two of which were best-sellers in India . So being an entrepreneur and being a yogi are not mutually exclusive ? <p> A : In India we say that your own karma done badly is better than someone else 's karma done well . The karma of a tree is to grow and bear fruit ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my karma is to be in business and marketing . I am expressing myself through it in many ways . I do n't see a big disconnect there . My best chance to become selfless , to express my karma , is to become a medium for my work . To be a full-time writer or a full-time meditation teacher is not my karma . <p> Q : You do teach meditation . <p> A : No , not really . I do n't teach ; I just share my experiences with it , my journey , my ups and downs with it . People ask me , " Do you want to be the next Deepak Chopra ? " I do n't , at all . That 's not my karma . Maybe that will change ; karma is a fluid concept with humans , and it does change . But I 'm not in the mode of reinventing all the time . <p> Q : Your books that came out in India did very well there , but is there a difference in this novel . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's changed very dramatically since I came to the U.S. Some things have not changed " my focus on entertainment and meaning , for example . I think , " What is the question my book is trying to answer ? " And , " How do I make it a page-turner ? " I do n't want it to be a Ph.D . dissertation or a nonfiction book . What has changed is that the meaning in my life has become deeper , and this is a much deeper novel than my earlier ones . I think earlier I was trying to figure out what success in the world meant , but my life experience in the past few years has been profound . My mother passed away after a very significant battle with cancer , which brought me into a deeper connection with my spiritual being . I 've thought a lot about the nature of humans , and what it means to suffer " why are people born , why do they die ? All these basic questions , and I 've been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is to some extent a consequence of that . <p> Q : Part of what inspires Max to travel to India to study is the stories he hears about these advanced yogis with what seem like superhuman powers " extreme longevity , for example , or the ability to survive extremely harsh weather conditions , or to read peoples ' minds . Do such people really exist ? <p> A : Yes , a hundred percent . They do exist . There are people who are able to achieve very extraordinary physical powers . It almost happens to them without them seeking it out . But they live in very inaccessible places , and so are very hard to get to . Some part of this is scientific rather than mystical . To take a small example , I talk in the book about people who can read minds . That is very scientifically understood . It 's as if words are a form of thought , and thought is a form of feeling , and if someone has really purified and simplified their life , for them it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Living in that part of the world , as I have , you see these things happen right in front of you . <p> Q : You have personally met people who have these powers ? <p> A : It depends on which powers you mean . I have met people who can speak to you without you articulating your thoughts , yes . The other things have been heavily researched , and there are logical explanations for how these things happen . <p> Q : You describe a process whereby through meditation , these people are able to slow down their metabolism , age less quickly and so on . <p> A : Yes . There is a lot of scientific research being done in this area . <p> Q : At one point in the novel , Max is training with a yogi , and there 's a drought , there 's very little food or water , and basically they 're starving . The yogi keeps saying , " Whatever we have is enough . " But it 's a challenge for Max in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of identity . One layer is what he 's capable of physically . Another layer is what he 's capable of emotionally . He sheds layers and layers of what it means to be a person , until there is no individual left at all . But you reach the point where you ca n't become anymore . There 's no chasing it anymore ; it has to come to you . <p> Q : That would be a particularly difficult task , perhaps , for an American " especially someone like Max , whose life has been about acquiring layers of identity , not shedding them . He 's an immigrant , a resident of a tough neighborhood , a Wall Street banker . And he does worry , while he 's training at the ashram , that he 's going to be broke and unemployable if he keeps on the yogi 's path . I 'm thinking you would have a better feeling for that after spending time in the U.S. Maybe you would n't have been able to write this novel , in fact , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly . That 's very true . Most of the writers I meet in New York , they knew they wanted to be writers when they were five years old . At the age of 28 , I had n't ever written a book or even conceived that I could . But the whole deconstruction of who I was began when I left India . And the further away from India that I went , and the less and less I relied on other people 's definitions of who I was , or my own definition " I was a business school graduate " I started to discover parts of myself that I did n't know existed . The shedding of my identity happened almost spontaneously with me because I was outside my notions of who I was . And the same thing happens in the book . <p> Q : Maybe in this novel you 're explaining these concepts to a Western audience , an American audience , whereas in India , readers would know this stuff already . <p> A : That 's true . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian character , was to approach the subject completely from the other side , rather than from my own perspective and biases .

@@13436326 @2036326/ <p> The Trump administration made a clear break Thursday with diplomatic efforts to talk North Korea out of a nuclear confrontation , bringing the United States and its Asian allies closer to a military response than at any point in more than a decade . <p> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that 20 years of trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed and that he was visiting Asia " to exchange views on a new approach . " <p> Soon after Tillerson 's remarks , in a sign of mounting tensions , the North Korean Embassy held an extraordinary news conference in Beijing to blame the potential for nuclear war on the United States while vowing that its homegrown nuclear testing program will continue in self-defense . <p> North Korea has amassed a huge nuclear stockpile and appears at the brink of being able to strike the U.S. mainland and American allies in Asia . The rising threat from the isolated military dictatorship has prompted the Trump administration to begin assessing its options for how to respond and serves as an early test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . <p> One potential immediate response would be to strengthen existing South Korean missile capabilities or to provide Japan with new offensive missile ability . Japan 's defense chief told parliament this month that he would not rule out " first strike " capability , which would be a major departure from Japan 's postwar pacifist traditions . <p> The United States could also field the same THAAD missile-defense system in Japan that it is now installing in South Korea or take the potentially provocative stop of reinstalling American nuclear weapons at U.S. bases in South Korea . The North Korean threat could also rekindle the largely dormant idea of a domestic U.S. missile defense system . <p> North Korea has boasted of an intercontinental ballistic missile , and experts on Asia security generally agree that such a capability is within Pyongyang 's reach . Preventing it outright would probably require a military strike on North Korean facilities , something the United States has considered an option of last resort because it would almost certainly result in an attack on South Korea and U.S. forces stationed there , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to recognize that the political and diplomatic efforts of the past 20 years to bring North Korea to the point of denuclearization have failed , " Tillerson said . <p> The secretary of state 's reference to decades of failure alluded to the carrot-and-stick diplomacy that began with a 1994 deal between the United States and North Korea . Under it , Pyongyang would have received aid and two proliferation-resistant nuclear power plants in return for freezing and eventually dismantling its nuclear weapons program . <p> That deal collapsed in 2002 , and North Korea achieved its first atomic test in 2006 . The George W. Bush administration 's efforts at a new deal collapsed , and Pyongyang has managed to build up its stockpile of nuclear material as well as refine its missiles despite what on paper look like crushing international sanctions . <p> North Korea 's nuclear and missile efforts have intensified under dictator Kim Jong Un , who took power in 2011 , and appear to have escalated further since Donald Trump 's election . <p> The country last month tested a missile that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , then this month fired a salvo of four missiles , part of what it said was a drill to practice hitting American military bases in Japan . Three of the four missiles landed in waters within Japan 's exclusive economic zone . <p> Tillerson 's remarks reflected growing agitation in Washington that a tougher stance on North Korea is required . <p> Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last month that the United States has three choices : what he called " proactive regime change , " to topple Kim ; sanctions and other coercive measures ; or military cooperation with Japan and South Korea that could include a preemptive strike on missile facilities . " Otherwise , we 're staring down the barrel of an ICBM , " Corker said . <p> Tillerson made a version of Trump 's argument that the United States will demand clear benefits for its diplomacy and foreign aid and will walk away when necessary . Tillerson scoffed at the U.S. expense for trying to entice North Korea to drop its nuclear program - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been met with further development of nuclear capabilities , more missile launches , " including this month and last , Tillerson said . " In the face of this ever-escalating threat , it is clear that a different approach is required . " <p> On Friday , Tillerson will be in South Korea , where more than 20 million people live within range of North Korean artillery . South Korea is conducting joint military exercises with U.S. forces , and installation of the THAAD system begins this month . <p> " The joint military exercises by the hostile forces are aimed at preemptive strikes against the DPRK , " North Korean Embassy official Pak Myong-ho said , referring to the official name of his country , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea . " Therefore , the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula is under serious threat , " he said . " Now the situation is already on the brink of nuclear war . " <p> Pak said the exercises could " turn into real combat at any time . " <p> While strident North Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a news conference in a third country to drive the message home was a dramatic step . China is North Korea 's protector and only ally , and Beijing is the only capital where the North could so quickly summon Western reporters . <p> Tillerson 's last stop on his six-day trip will be in China , which remains skeptical of any U.S. military response . <p> Last week , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the United States and North Korea were like " two accelerating trains " on a collision course , while Premier Li Keqiang cautioned Wednesday that " tension may lead to conflict . " <p> There are sharply different views in the region about how to lower the North Korean threat , with China in particular unwilling to do anything that might destabilize the desperately poor agrarian nation on its border . <p> Under discussion in addition to potential military moves are tighter U.S. sanctions on the regime and secondary sanctions against its commercial allies . Those steps are considered largely symbolic unless China uses its economic leverage to slow or end North Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaled that it could increase financial penalties against Chinese companies and banks that do business with North Korea . <p> China has imposed a ban on coal imports from North Korea , a move that - if fully implemented - would deprive the regime of a crucial revenue stream . But many analysts doubt Beijing will uphold the ban , given the instability it could create on China 's borders . <p> Tillerson 's remarks seemed to shut the door on any rekindling of international talks that had involved Japan , South Korea and China to persuade the dynastic regime to stop firing missiles and pursuing nuclear weapons . <p> The failed diplomatic outreach had coincided with U.S. efforts to reassure North Korea that it did not plan an unprovoked attack - something the North has long claimed is a Washington plot . <p> In his opening remarks in Tokyo , Tillerson appeared to give a nod to those reassurances , however .

@@13436346 @2036346/ <p> What are the odds of a symphony orchestra 's giving the premieres of works by father-and-son composers within the same month ? <p> That in fact is the case at Symphony Center where the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the beginning of March gave the local premiere of John Adams ' " Scheherazade.2 " as part of a 70th birthday tribute to Adams , and , on Thursday night , presented the world premiere of the CSO-commissioned " many words of love " by his son , Samuel Adams , under the baton of Riccardo Muti . <p> Completed in October , this first Samuel Adams score to be performed by the CSO is the latest in a series of pieces in which the orchestra 's resident composer " a post he shares with Elizabeth Ogonek " mingles sounds produced by acoustic instruments with electronic resonance to create new aural vistas . <p> Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune <p> Composer Samuel Adams bows at a presentation of his work " many words of love " on March 16 , 2017 , at Symphony Center in Chicago . <p> Composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many words of love " on March 16 , 2017 , at Symphony Center in Chicago . ( Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune ) <p> The lowercase title quotes a line in Schubert 's song " Der Lindenbaum " ( from the cycle " Die Winterreise " ) about carving " so many words of love " in the bark of a linden tree , an image Adams relates to the present-day environmental crisis . Although the composer claims the harmonic content is " loosely based " on the Schubert lied , I could detect nothing Schubertian in the three-part , 20-minute opus . <p> The gnashing dissonant chord that launches " many words of love " sets us up for a weird , sometimes unsettling sonic exploration . The orchestra roils , heaves and pulses with waves of activity , some of it dense , some of it extremely subtle . Adams employs extended playing techniques familiar from much contemporary composition to produce eerie clouds of harmonics , toneless crunches in the strings , muted wails in the brass " while adding techniques of his own . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second section where percussionist Cynthia Yeh produced a loud metallic rasp by scraping the rim of a bell plate with a cup , while colleague Patricia Dash scraped sandpaper blocks .

What is meant to be organic musical development feels manipulated , geared toward immediate sensation . Whatever fierce emotions inspired the music are not conveyed with any expressive urgency or directness . <p> Muti has always served his CSO resident composers with the utmost loyalty and dedication , and he did so again on this occasion . " Many words of love " is the only world premiere the music director is conducting here this season . Under his firm , efficient direction , the orchestra musicians delivered what appeared to be a thoroughly prepared rendition , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . Adams managed to get in a couple of quick bows before the polite applause faded . <p> While the Adams piece failed to ignite much enthusiasm in the audience , the crowd was unrestrained in its admiration of the patrician elegance Mitsuko Uchida brought to her performance of Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . <p> This great pianist offered a more Mozartean perspective on the C-minor concerto than other soloists have presented in recent seasons here . One has heard more overtly dramatic readings , but few that approached Uchida 's sensitivity , refinement or cultivated classicism . Her cadenza was quietly commanding , and the hushed , unhurried soliloquy she made of the Largo was pure poetry . <p> Uchida and Muti are longtime collaborators , and his accompaniment could not have been more sympathetic . Here was a distinguished addition to the Beethoven piano concerto cycle that is unfolding this season at Orchestra Hall . <p> The concert began with a fizzy and charming romp through Rossini 's " La Scala di Seta " Overture and ended with a strong , commanding account of the Schumann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master have always been prime Muti territory , and his Fourth was masterful . He steered the CSO through Schumann 's thickets of orchestration without succumbing to the muddiness that trips up many a conductor .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes waned over her three seasons at UConn . <p> Geno Auriemma attributes it to the physical setback following two surgical procedures on her knee .

" This is her second year of basketball in the last four years . " <p> She is also hyper competitive and struggled with failure . <p> " If it was dominoes , if it was checkers , if it was horseshoes , she would just figure out how to win , " said Williams ' father , Matt .

" I do n't think there 's another program in the country where you could get that .

But there is no regret for an athlete who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for her knee injury . <p> " I do n't ever think about what could have been , " Williams said " I 'm here . I 'm here for a reason . " <p> Next year , she will play in front of familiar faces when UConn plays at Nevada in her homecoming game . Not only did her father play for the program in Reno , but her sister Kayla was a forward for Nevada . <p> Will Williams be playing guard when she returns home ? She could , but her ability to handle the ball and and pass makes her a unique post player . It 's rare to have a post player with the hands of a guard . <p> And Williams believes her vertical leap will improve . She lost some height on her vertical leap after the surgeries , so she could leap even higher next season . <p> " When I came , I was just like , how can I help ? " Williams said . " How can be a part of the team ? It was helpful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more of a part of everything . I did n't see it as , ' Oh , I 'm sacrificing .

All she could do was cry . All she wanted to do was scream . <p> After Stingley lost 40 pounds in a matter of weeks , her sister finally took her to see a doctor , and she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder . <p> " It 's still a battle , " said Stingley , 40 . " I died and they just forgot to bury me . It 's a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged neighborhoods have PTSD , experts say . A recent Northwestern Medicine study that examined the South Side neighborhood of Oakland found that 29 percent of the 72 African-American study participants have the disorder and an additional 7 percent exhibited a large number of signs that are part of a PTSD diagnosis . Researchers said they believe that points to a need for more mental health services and screenings in poor neighborhoods . <p> Stingley , who lived in Park Manor at the time of her daughter 's death , was not part of the research . <p> Women who already had mild to severe depressive symptoms were chosen for the study , which was published in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities , a peer-reviewed publication , in December . <p> After losing her daughter to gun violence in 2013 on the South Side of Chicago , Nortasha Stingley developed post-traumatic stress disorder .

It also can lead to PTSD or subthreshold PTSD , meaning a number of symptoms characterizing PTSD are present . <p> " People are struggling , " said Inger Burnett-Zeigler , a clinical psychologist and one of the authors on the study . " People are struggling severely , and I think that sometimes the negative implications of mental illness are really underestimated .

And violence is on a similar pace in 2017 . <p> Because the Tribune violence database defines shootings by addresses and not neighborhoods , the ZIP code that covers Oakland is linked to sections of other neighborhoods . But homicide entries are defined by specific neighborhoods . <p> Dr. Michael Malone , who worked in Englewood for 11 years before spending the past four years in Bronzeville , said he has many patients who are dealing with trauma and struggling with PTSD . <p> " Sometimes the PTSD is missed or a lot of times , it could be the patient not being forthcoming with past trauma or past physical abuse , and it 's something that is definitely out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unfortunately in the inner city where we are , that 's something that needs to be addressed more , and the study was right on .

" <p> The study is not comprehensive , involving one neighborhood and a small sample size . More research is needed , but the findings are consistent with previous , narrower studies about the effect of disadvantaged neighborhoods on residents , Burnett-Zeigler said . <p> Making mental health available at primary care and community hospitals is the first step toward ensuring that people get screened and receive high-quality care , especially in a city where treatment options are shrinking , Burnett-Zeigler said . <p> Mental health resources on the community level are needed , but crime victim services also are crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can help educate , support and counsel those who have been exposed to violence , whether directly or indirectly .

But most days , she just wants someone who will listen without judgment . <p> " We have to figure out ways that we can get it out better and get help because it 's like a cancer , " Stingley said .

But the group ran into such strong opposition from the University of Illinois , a public institution , that the dispute has shifted to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit . <p> A conflict over the public 's right to know involving laboratory beagles ? Our ears perked up . We 're interested in animal welfare . We also believe a fundamental obligation of government is to be open about the work it does with the people 's money . <p> And so we have an intriguing battle concerning beagle rights and legal rights . <p> The use of live animals in labs is controversial , and it 's upsetting to animal lovers . Often it 's necessary for research , testing or education . When it can be eliminated " without health risk to humans " great . Medical schools , for example , now teach surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For animal rights activists , beagles are a focus because the breed " small and docile " is used in many laboratories . The Beagle Freedom Project wants all animal testing eliminated , but the group 's Jeremy Beckham acknowledged that goal is n't yet realistic . Instead , the organization pushes for legislation requiring publicly funded labs to make efforts to place animals for adoption when their use in the lab is done . The alternative to adoption typically is euthanasia . <p> In Springfield , an adoption bill fizzled after the U. of I. convinced lawmakers that its own adoption program , reliant on employees and students , worked fine . But there was another aggressive element to the beagle project 's strategy : Use public records laws to learn as much as possible about the school 's use of beagles . " We want to highlight some of the nastiest practices going on in laboratories , and having access to internal records is crucial to doing that , " Beckham told us . <p> The U. of I. fought back , citing legally permitted FOIA exemptions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did release information about what was happening in the lab , but with redactions . When the Beagle Freedom Project appealed , the Illinois attorney general 's office provided the group with a partial victory : The U. of I. was right to withhold medical records because faculty research materials are exempt from disclosure , but the lab protocols are public documents and the university had redacted information it should have released . The ruling was not binding , so the U. of I. did not give in . <p> A university spokesperson declined our interview request , citing the lawsuit . But Lyndon Goodly , a U. of I. veterinarian , spoke at an industry conference last year about the conflict between animal labs and the Beagle Freedom Project 's aggressive use of FOIA requests ( the group filed multiple paperwork-intensive requests with the school , one per dog ) . <p> Goodly , according to a recording provided to the Tribune 's Jodi S. Cohen by the Beagle Freedom Project , advised researchers who get FOIA requests to " fight like hell " to reject them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information without a fight , " he said . " It 's a law , but every law just like the regulatory environment we live in , it 's up for interpretation . " <p> What info is the U. of I. shielding ? <p> A May 24 Tribune article quoted a U. of I. spokesperson saying dogs and cats owned by the school are used to test ingredients used in pet food . Most of those animals are then adopted , though others are put down to be further analyzed . <p> But pet food tests are n't all that take place in the labs . <p> Correspondence between the attorney general 's office and the U. of I. show , for example , that the university also used beagles to test a medical device on behalf of a private company . According to the Beagle Freedom Project 's FOIA suit , unredacted protocol information indicates university researchers were " conducting heart experiments on dogs where it restrained them in a sling and then deliberately caused the dogs to have heart attacks . " Dogs were then injected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Animals that would n't remain calm in the slings might be euthanized or retained for a different experiment , the protocol said . There was no mention of adoption as an alternative . <p> Why not ? There are other legitimate questions concerning the U. of I. 's practices : Which companies are paying the university , and how much money is involved ? What is the purpose of these experiments ? How are individual animals treated ? <p> The answers are n't always pleasant . Lab animals exist to serve science . Many die doing so . The obligation of all researchers is to follow legal and ethical guidelines to prevent abuse . Public institutions like the University of Illinois have an additional responsibility : to open their work to taxpayer scrutiny , even when they would rather not .

He has made his preference clear for years , most bitingly in his 2013 autobiography . <p> " If the Hall came to me and said , ' We want you to go in as a Dodger , ' I 'd say , ' Well , then I 'll go in as nothing , ' " Piazza wrote .

" <p> The Dodgers have not been shy with the game plan , transitioning from a high-paid , star-laden team to one packed with home-grown talent , assembled by some of the most renowned executives in the sport . The best chance to win that long-awaited World Series , they argue , is to field a good team every year rather than surrender prospects and go for the gold in any one particular year . The more financial flexibility they can maintain , the better their chance to keep the next Piazza or Beltre in Dodger blue for his entire career . <p> All of that amounts to " trust us " from the Dodgers .

Heartbreak . Nuclear annihilation . <p> Prince 's " 1999 " urged us to get ready for two out of three . He was our coolest Cold War child , sensitive and streetwise enough to convince the masses that dancing in the nuclear twilight might even be fun . Now , as our new president blurts forth his vision for an increasingly weaponized planet , " 1999 " sounds disconcertingly fresh . We 're a little bit closer to " over-oops-out-of-time . " Old songs suddenly have new work to do . <p> Pop 's nuclear songbook is surprisingly thick , but its tensile strength has always been tested by the weight of our fears - fears that can feel dumb and irrational until smart , rational people start feeling them , too . So here 's Philip Roth in the New Yorker back in January : " What is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything possible , including , of course , the nuclear catastrophe . " Roth 's 2004 novel " The Plot Against America " is n't about a farewell flash , but it does imagine a dystopia as chilling as those rendered in George Orwell 's " 1984 " and Aldous Huxley 's " Brave New World " - all of which have enjoyed a sales spike since Trump 's election . Readers crave wisdom in senseless times . <p> But we listen to nuclear pop for different reasons . We borrow Joe Strummer 's macho courage when we sing along with the Clash 's " London Calling " ( " A nuclear era , but I have no fear " ) . We pout with Morrissey when he begs for the bomb during " Everyday Is Like Sunday " ( " Come , armageddon , come " ) . And when R.E.M . tells us that " It 's The End of the World As We Know It ( And I Feel Fine ) , " we feel pretty fine , too . <p> That 's because throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that nigh - not even during " A Hard Rain 's a-Gonna Fall , " a ballad that Bob Dylan first performed a month before Kennedy announced the existence of Soviet nukes in Cuba . Oblivion had never felt closer , but the dangers foretold in Dylan 's prophecy sounded far away - the stuff of " seven sad forests " and " a dozen dead oceans . " Then again , that was 1962 . Maybe they 're closer now . <p> In the ' 80s , mushroom clouds began to sprout on MTV with numbing regularity , as if the network 's entire purpose was to toughen up the children of the Reagan era through a fit of atomic hiccups . You could spot the death-bloom in videos for David Bowie 's " Let 's Dance , " and Genesis ' " Land of Confusion , " and Culture Club 's " The War Song , " and Time Zone 's " World Destruction , " and Donald Fagen 's " New Frontier , " and Fishbone 's " Party at Ground Zero " - a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B-movie starring you . " <p> One way to stop fearing the bomb was to laugh it away . If not that , fantasize about your invincibility . Nena 's cautionary " 99 Luftballons " was sung from the perspective of a survivor , while the embryonic narrator of Kate Bush 's " Breathing " was preparing to be born into the ruins . That 's the funny thing about nuclear winter : Life goes on , but probably not yours . <p> Survival is a central theme in rap music , so when a new century approached , it only made sense that rappers began declaring themselves impervious to doomsday . And while Method Man , Three 6 Mafia and others funneled end-times bravura directly into their rhymes , it was Busta Rhymes who most eagerly espoused the end the of the world , turning his first three solo albums into an informal rapture countdown .

Keep listening . <p> Meantime , the durability of rap 's most salient armageddon jam has more to do with systemic racial profiling than lingering nuclear paranoia . In the second verse of 1997 's " Apocalypse , " Wyclef Jean reports that Brooklyn has just " turned to Hiroshima , " so with an entire borough vaporized , he flees to New Jersey , where the cops attempt to pull him over for driving while black . Amid the chaos , someone has robbed a gas station , and our hero matches the description . But it could n't have been him - " I was at the Grammys with Brandy , " Wyclef raps .

We buy them up hoping that we 'll never actually have to use them , like bicycle helmets , or the extra coverage at the Hertz kiosk . They feel insufficient . As they should . No one song could truly prepare us for a self-inflicted mass extinction - but there are two that bravely and generously try . <p> The first is " Nuclear War , " a relatively obscure jazz prayer recorded by the visionary Sun Ra in 1982 . Over a series of ascending piano chords , the bandleader casually draws the members of his legendary Arkestra into a devastating singalong : " It 's a mother------ , do n't you know/If they push that button , your ass got ta go . " The man sounds loose , relaxed , profoundly disappointed , but ultimately at peace with the fact that his wishes have no bearing on our planet 's nuclear destiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye and accepts it . <p> And then there 's " 1999 , " a song that soothes our collective fear of collective death by inviting all of humanity to the greatest party ever thrown . Prince knew the score . " Everybody 's got a bomb , we could all die any day , " he sang , " but before I 'll let that happen , I 'll dance my life away . " This was n't platitudinous seize-the-day babble . It was an ecstatic expression of resistance . Still is .

@@13436392 @2036392/ <h> Report recommends dozens of reforms at Chicago 's Law Department <p> Former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb has recommended more than 50 reforms to address problems in the city of Chicago 's Law Department , which has come under fire in recent months for its handling of potential evidence in police misconduct cases . <p> " For a large and extremely busy office like the ( police litigation division ) which has around 40 attorneys at any given time , handles hundreds of cases per year , and takes many cases to trial , it may be impossible to eliminate all discovery-related errors or oversights , " says the report , which was done by Webb and a team of attorneys from the Winston &amp; Strawn law firm . " However , various policies and procedures can be put in place to help minimize the opportunities for such discovery errors to occur . " <p> In a gently worded report that focused more on future reforms than past failings , Webb 's group called for new , robust training concentrating , in part , on " reinforcing a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stronger communication with the Police Department during discovery , the formal legal process in which potential evidence is exchanged between opposing parties . <p> The report also recommended that the Law Department stop interviewing defendant officers in a group setting , a practice that critics have said promotes the department 's code of silence by allowing officers to align their stories . Webb 's team said group interviews are not unethical but should be avoided because of the potential conflicts involved . <p> The report stresses that city attorneys need a stronger understanding of how police records are maintained . For example , city lawyers told Webb 's team that they only recently learned about GPS data maintained by the Police Department and that some search warrant-related documents are stored on the West Side . <p> " Almost uniformly , ( police litigation division ) attorneys acknowledged during interviews that they could benefit from a more comprehensive knowledge of the universe of CPD or other City documents that exist , and that at times they have experienced challenges during discovery as a consequence of not possessing a complete knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-keeping , " the report states . <p> In an interview with the Tribune , Webb said he and his team found the Law Department eager to improve and quick to adopt changes as the review went on . The problems at the department were more about the flow of information between the department and Chicago police , he said , as opposed to an intentional withholding of records to gain an advantage in court or to further a code of silence that protects problem cops . <p> " I did n't find that there was a culture inside the Law Department for management to put their head in the sand and not want documents to be discovered that should be produced , " Webb said . " Their cooperation was not phony . " <p> Local plaintiffs ' attorneys " many of whom were interviewed as part of the review " considered Webb 's findings to be something of a paradox . Despite the conclusion that the city does not intentionally conceal documents , the report 's recommendations indicate that the police litigation division is understaffed , needs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for producing documents . <p> " This scenario created a de facto unintentional practice and policy of civil plaintiff 's attorneys either not getting requested documents or getting them late in discovery because of these failures , " said attorney Antonio Romanucci , who was interviewed by Webb 's team as part of the review . " It is all of our hope that the city takes this report seriously and implements the recommendations of the Winston &amp; Strawn report without hesitation and quickly . " <p> Webb 's findings come one month after a Tribune investigation that detailed how the Law Department routinely fights requests to turn over potential evidence in police misconduct cases . <p> A Tribune analysis of nearly 450 cases alleging police misconduct since Emanuel took office found that in more than 19 percent of the cases " nearly 1 in every 5 " a federal judge ordered the city to turn over police reports , personnel files or other potential evidence it objected to providing plaintiffs . <p> In cases involving allegations of wrongful convictions or serious excessive force such as police shootings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city 's image are the most serious , the frequency jumped to 27 percent , more than 1 in 4 cases . <p> And in five cases , the city 's conduct was found to be so inappropriate that federal judges took the unusual step of handing down sanctions . Those sanctions led a judge in two cases to take the even rarer step of throwing out jury verdicts that had favored the city and ordering new trials . <p> In reviewing the department 's procedures , Webb and his team interviewed more than 90 people , including more than four dozen plaintiff 's lawyers . They also interviewed every division attorney and reviewed 75 police misconduct cases , most of which were filed in federal court . <p> Webb and Winston &amp; Strawn partner Robert Michels also met with Mayor Rahm Emanuel in March to update him on their findings . The mayor declined to comment on the report . <p> Emanuel tapped Webb to lead the review in early January , just days after U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang sanctioned one city lawyer for intentionally concealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate key records in a lawsuit stemming from the fatal police shooting of Darius Pinex . <p> " Some of these are common-sense recommendations that should have been in place a long time ago , " Greenberg said . " But in the past , the city preferred to keep blinders on , and it kept the truth from coming out . " <p> Stephen Patton , Emanuel 's hand-picked corporation counsel , has rejected any implication of wrongdoing among his staff of about 45 attorneys in the Civil Rights Litigation Division . Patton , though , told the Tribune last month that he had instituted several reforms to ensure better discovery practices , including a policy that drastically reduces the Police Department 's role in collecting documents needed for litigation . <p> Other reforms include setting up an in-house document management system to ensure that discovery can be better tracked , new policies requiring attorneys to double- and triple-check which records have been turned over , and hiring outside lawyers to represent individual officers in cases involving the most egregious misconduct allegations . <p> In anticipation of Webb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen discovery and ethics-related training sessions since January . He also has added three new attorney positions to cut the workload and has hired more paralegals . <p> " There is room for improvement in any organization , and the Federal Civil Rights Litigation Division is no exception , " Patton said in a statement Thursday . " As I said when we announced this review , we would not wait to implement improvements suggested by Mr. Webb and his team . " <p> Many of the reforms are applauded in Webb 's report , including Patton 's recent decision to have city lawyers collect law enforcement records themselves instead of relying upon the Police Department 's office of legal affairs . <p> " Information we gathered during the review suggests that working through OLA often has proven to be extremely difficult and cumbersome for ( city ) attorneys , " the report states . <p> Since the Tribune 's report , a federal judge has sanctioned the city for withholding a key investigative file controlled by the city 's Independent Police Review Authority , which investigates excessive force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past five years that Emanuel 's administration had been sanctioned for violations during discovery , the formal process of exchanging information and potential evidence in a civil case . <p> Federal judges also are considering sanctions requests in two other police misconduct lawsuits .

Even if , like me , you think this is one of the two or three greatest musicals ever written for the American stage , you 're likely tempted to skip the touring production recently arrived at the Cadillac Palace Theatre . Especially since this is a Broadway tour that did not flow from a Broadway show , just a title that is known to sell . <p> But it invariably is a mistake to underestimate the wily old Broadway director Jack O'Brien . <p> This is a tour " a union tour with Broadway veterans " of notable quality . <p> It lands very deftly in the sweet spot of this show : enough traditionalism to deliver the full " Sound of Music " monty ( Alps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of fresh eyes and enough irreverence to cut the Nutella . You would n't call it a revisionist production " the designer Douglas W. Schmidt provides traditional Alpine vistas , of the kind that once hung over my parents ' dining room table , but they are more artful than you first realize , beautifully connected to the emotional core of the show . <p> And there is a lot of fresh , fast-paced humor , whether it 's Kerstin Anderson 's Maria lurking in the background of " Sixteen Going on Seventeen , " taking notes ; an especially ebullient staging of " Do-Re-Mi " ; Melody Betts despairing as a very approachable Mother Abbess ; or Iris Davies ' Brigitta , always my favorite of the kinder Von Trapp , assuming the moral authority the show affords her and quietly running the lives of the adults . <p> Anderson , who has a gorgeous voice , approaches Maria not as the traditional blank slate from the abbey for Capt .

It 's rather as is if Maria is being played by a character actress , far removed from the Julie Andrews archetype , and it has the effect of downplaying the romantic conventionalities of the piece . <p> In watching all these versions of " The Sound of Music " over the years , I 've come to understand that the most crucial thing is not that you believe Maria and the Captain have fallen in love , but that you feel sure the children will thrive and prosper once their new mother has finished teaching their old father how to do his job . So it goes here . <p> This is partly a trend with this piece " these days , the Captain usually has to travel much further than Maria , for she does not become a Baroness so much as he learns how to find his inner-child . But a vulnerable Von Trapp like Ben Davis , whose performance is generous toward Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves the piece better than the earlier , stoic model you can watch on your screen . And O'Brien gives the decision-making skills of the final discovery " or non-discovery " moment to Paige Silvester 's Liesl , which is where it belongs . Although O'Brien still makes it clear that she needs her dad . It 's an exceptionally moving finale , even if you 've seen it a million times . <p> But Anderson also finds moments of intense truth : I 've never seen a Maria in such a total panic at the thought of being sent away from the Abbey , although it makes perfect sense , dramaturgically . If you think about it , life is a whirl for Maria , since the structure of this musical begins with a romantic conflict , resolves it early in Act 2 and then throws in the storm troopers as the Von Trapp inner circle unravels , leaving Maria as the only ally of a single parent and his kids . O'Brien , Betts and Anderson clearly understand that the story of " The Sound of Music " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but about a young woman forced to leave the place , and the surrogate mother and sisters , she loves . Three times . The last time perhaps forever . <p> The key scene in Act 2 is when Von Trapp realizes he now ca n't do anything at all without Maria , and that is the rich sense of self-discovery afforded here . Meanwhile , the kids are kids , looking always for security . They certainly do n't find it in Teri Hansen 's child-hating Elsa Schraeder or Merwin Foard 's self-protecting Max , both of whom sent shivers down my spine and , more importantly , put in my head the thought that children usually get no say over candidates for a stepparent even though that choice will dictate so much of their happiness , or lack thereof . <p> Like most truly great works of drama , " The Sound of Music " reflects the current moment more than its own ; this production , which is well worth seeing , suggests that fathers are learning , slowly , about what they need to do , even as new demagogues abound .

His mother , Tina , whom Goldie Hunter also helped raise , was " comfortable with the arrangement , " the Rev. Hunter said . Goldie Hunter kept him with her until her death at age 78 on Aug. 9 , 2013 . McDonald stayed with his mother while his great-grandmother was hospitalized but eventually was placed with an uncle . <p> Tina Hunter petitioned the court shortly after to try to regain custody .

And it was n't long before police in his Austin neighborhood took notice . <p> His great-grandmother said he would " normally get arrested 2-3 days a week , " according to a court record . She did not believe the police were " picking on him , " she said . In fact , officers let him go with several " station adjustments , " or reprimands . <p> Some of McDonald 's police contacts showed him to be little more than a neighborhood nuisance : He and a buddy began smoking dope in a pizza shop , not noticing the cops just outside the door .

He was placed on long periods of intensive probation , often with electronic monitoring , mandatory school , community service , outpatient mental health services , drug treatment and in-home therapy . <p> The court , it seemed , was trying to reach him . The professionals involved in his life knew he was in trouble , according to their reports , and it was n't that unusual for his probation officer or a youth outreach worker to drive around his neighborhood at night in search of him .

He came to court high in August 2013 and the judge sent him to lockup . Afterward , when asked why he bothered to show up if high , McDonald said he " got tired of running ( from the court ) .

There was something about McDonald , it appeared , that made people want to give him another chance .

Though he was participating in addiction services and individual and family counseling , records show , McDonald often could not control his anger . He received multiple reprimands for fighting with peers , threatening staff and being verbally abusive , among other infractions . <p> He had his freedom back in late May after a unique court hearing in which his judges in both the delinquency and child protection divisions brought everyone together , including McDonald , to work out a plan for his future .

He regularly visited patients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near the White House . These stops were unannounced because of security concerns and hassles for the hospital staff that come with a full-blown presidential visit . <p> One morning in 2005 , White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan sent me in his place to visit the wounded warriors . It was my first time for that particular assignment , and I was nervous about how the visits would go . The president was scheduled to see 25 patients at Walter Reed .

Anderson simultaneously had appealed his punishment in 2014 through the grievance process , and IPRA waited to hear the outcome . None came , however . The Police Board decision mooted his grievance , a police spokesman said , so IPRA was waiting for a decision that would n't come . <p> Alerted to the issue by the Tribune , IPRA sent paperwork to CPD on Dec. 29 so the department would schedule his suspension . <p> Lewis , who is divorced from Anderson , believed he had been punished long ago .

Lewis served a two-day suspension , using compensatory time , but Anderson challenged his 10-day suspension . <p> After unsuccessfully contesting the punishment through department channels , he initiated a grievance in 2015 , records show .

" <p> Earlier this month , after the Tribune asked questions , Anderson finally did serve the 10-day suspension . But , like Lewis , he did n't miss any work ; he used comp time to serve the punishment . The case was closed Tuesday . <p> As Anderson 's cases illustrate , when IPRA recommends a punishment , it is only the beginning of the discipline process . <p> From there , a case ping-pongs between IPRA and the Police Department .

And it was typically in that waiting period , when IPRA was expecting to hear the outcome of an appeal but officers never actually followed through on filing a grievance , that cases fell into a black hole . In cases the Tribune reviewed , IPRA made no attempt to determine if the appeal progressed and the department made no attempt to find out why officers ' suspensions were n't moving forward . <p> That means cases " got lost in the system , " Sissac acknowledged . <p> " It is the classic pop-up between the left fielder and the shortstop , " said Bowman , the Northwestern professor .

' " <p> It 's another failing by police authorities who already have faced years of criticism for lax and lengthy investigations of police officers , who are rarely held accountable for misconduct . From 2007 to 2015 , IPRA upheld only about 4 percent of the complaints it reviewed , an earlier Tribune analysis found . <p> The Tribune 's latest findings about lost cases come as the city and its Police Department have been under national scrutiny since the 2015 video release that showed a white officer , Jason Van Dyke , shooting African-American teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times . The video 's release unleashed long-simmering frustration with how police deal with the community and how the city too often fails to discipline its officers . <p> A task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel suggested numerous reforms last year , and the U.S. Justice Department earlier this year affirmed that the broken disciplinary system allows officers to commit misconduct with little fear of repercussions . It recommended sweeping reform . <p> It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consent decree and push Chicago to reform its police force . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been critical of federal oversight , though police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and Emanuel have said they will pursue reform regardless of federal involvement . <p> Meantime , IPRA is expected to be replaced later this year with a new agency " the Civilian Office of Police Accountability " that has more power and staff to probe alleged police misconduct . Among other changes , officials hope to purchase and use a case management system to help keep cases from falling through the cracks . <p> " Every piece of how we communicate with CPD will be looked at , " Sissac said . <p> ' They 're above the law ' <p> With a case management system , authorities may not have lost track of the discipline recommended for Officer Michael Clemons . <p> Instead , he has continued to work , unpunished , seven years after his estranged wife , TuWanda Clemons , filed a complaint against him in 2010 after receiving a string of troubling text messages from him .

With the addition of Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating $5.5 million of cap room but also incurring $2 million more of dead money on their cap . <p> And while they subtracted Elvis Dumervil , Shareece Wright and Kendrick Lewis , they also tendered all six of their restricted free agents at $1.79 million a pop , made Williams the highest-paid nose tackle in the league at $10.8 million per year , made Jefferson the NFL 's sixth highest-paid safety at $9 million per year and also added Woodhead and Mallett . <p> In other words , they ca n't possibly have too much space remaining , and they 'll almost certainly have to make a few more cuts to add too much else of significance . <p> It appears the Ravens are in a stalemate with Dennis Pitta after they asked the popular tight end to take a pay cut . Releasing Pitta would create $3.3 million of cap room , but even more dead money ( $4.4 million ) .

They did that last year with tight end Chase Ford . It was a bit surprising to see the Ravens tender guys like defensive backs Jumal Rolle and Marqueston Huff and offensive linemen James Hurst and Ryan Jensen rather than releasing them and trying to re-sign them to more modest deals . <p> The good news for the Ravens is they have checked off a few of their offseason priorities .

Other options include Kendall Wright , Michael Floydand old friendsAnquan Boldin and Kamar Aiken . <p> Rick Wagner 's departure leaves the Ravens with a void at right tackle , and the only obviously internal candidates to replace him are the much-maligned Hurst and developmental tackles De'Ondre Wesley and Stephane Nembot .

He is the founder and CEO of Under Armour , and , just 20 years after he was selling shirts out of his grandmother 's basement , his company ranks as the eighth-fastest-growing firm in America , with 12,000 employees and projected revenues of nearly $5 billion this year . At this rate , it should end Baltimore 's Fortune 500 drought within the next couple of years . In and of itself , that rags-to-riches story ( and to be clear , we 're talking sweat-wicking , microfiber rags ) merits recognition . But in 2016 , Mr. Plank showed what it means when an entrepreneur of his skill , daring and ambition focuses not just on his company but on his community . In ways large and small , this city and state will never be the same because of what he accomplished . He is The Baltimore Sun 's 2016 Marylander of the Year . <p> For some time , it had been clear that Mr. Plank was quietly buying up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covington neighborhood , presumably for a new headquarters for Under Armour , which is bursting at the seams of its Tide Point complex . In retrospect , it should have been obvious that he would envision something grander than an office park or even a fancy corporate campus . What he had in mind was the single largest development Baltimore has seen in decades , if ever : a multibillion-dollar mix of offices , residences , retail , parks , boat launches , a light rail spur and a pedestrian bridge . ( The area includes The Sun 's printing facility , for which the paper has a long-term lease . ) In scope , the Inner Harbor is tiny by comparison . Situated just off Interstate 95 on the southern edge of town , the Port Covington development will replace travelers ' first impression of Baltimore " currently , the smokestack on a trash incinerator " with a gleaming new city of the future . <p> After a decade in which it seemed like every crane in the Mid-Atlantic was rising above Washington while Baltimore fought over scraps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of confidence in Baltimore and its future .

Such deals have come under increasing scrutiny in Baltimore in recent years , particularly as it has become clear that they have hurt the city when it comes to state aid for education . <p> Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank urged support for the Port Covington project and proposed investing more than $100 million in recreation centers , job training , schools and parks in a full-page ad Wednesday in The Baltimore Sun . <p> Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank urged support for the Port Covington project and proposed investing more than $100 million in recreation centers , job training , schools and parks in a full-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted extensive outreach and struck Baltimore 's largest-ever community benefits agreement with the neighborhoods around Port Covington , known as the South Baltimore Six .

" His team told us he was committed to Baltimore and was committed to doing what was right , " she said . <p> Baltimore 's chief entrepreneur <p> Pivotal though the Port Covington agreement was , it was by no means Mr. Plank 's only significant achievement of 2016 when it comes to building a stronger Baltimore .

" When someone of his stature in the business world is putting this kind of commitment into Baltimore , it makes people take another look . " <p> Meanwhile , Baltimore 's most successful entrepreneur deepened his connections to the city 's startup scene . His City Garage at Port Covington has helped expand Baltimore 's makerspace community with an eye toward boosting local manufacturing , and his BetaMore incubator has continued to provide early-stage support for tech companies . It held its second annual Beta City pitch competition for startups this year , providing $50,000 to the winner , health tech company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chief technology officer , said what set Beta City apart was the degree to which it was community-centric , bringing together people from a host of different industries , from finance to real estate , to help young companies grow . " Getting Kevin on the stage and him doing an awesome job , and getting our face on the map in Baltimore , gave us exposure to all those different kinds of individuals who can help with our business , " Mr. Budman said . <p> Charitable commitments <p> Mr. Plank 's charitable efforts also had a strong Baltimore focus . He donated $1 million each to the CollegeBound Foundation , which helps city students attend and complete college , and to the Partners in Excellence scholarship program for the city 's Catholic schools . Jim Sellinger , the chancellor of the archdiocesan schools , said the funds are targeted to the system 's four community schools , which are designed to provide opportunities to low-income students .

" He saw the opportunity to do something that is really game-changing and a model for what can be done across the city and around the country . " <p> Supporting the University of Maryland , College Park , Mr. Plank 's alma mater , has also long been a priority for him . This year , the redevelopment of Cole Field House , which Mr. Plank supported with a $25 million pledge , began to take shape .

' Not him . He 's abdicated his responsibility . " <p> That brought a swift response from the Rauner administration . <p> " A partisan rant coming from Madigan 's mayor is unhelpful to progress in Springfield , " said Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly , who suggested Emanuel should " focus less on alliteration and more on getting his murder capital city under control .

Business groups usually aligned with Rauner and his Republicans and unions normally allied with Democrats went to work against the plan . Retailers argued they could not support tax increases without major cuts in spending , manufacturers contended changes to workers ' compensation rules were superficial , teacher unions said property tax freezes would starve local school districts , and education groups warned that outsourcing janitorial jobs could jeopardize student safety . <p> Cullerton and others tried to paint the widespread opposition as a good thing , saying all sides must sacrifice to get a fair agreement . <p> " These individuals are special interests .

The idea being that if one piece of the puzzle failed , none of the bills could become law .

Rauner has not been part of negotiations and GOP senators do not want to cast votes on items Rauner opposes for fear of having the wealthy governor field a primary candidate against them in the future . At the same time , the lack of a comprehensive budget proposal for the next spending year that begins in July does n't allow GOP senators to show actual cuts in state spending to go along with tax increases . <p> Without enough Republican support this week , the Senate could try again for a vote when it returns to Springfield early next month . <p> " I have a partner , and if she needs to wait for any reason , that would be fine too , " said Cullerton , who was referring to Radogno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus want to wait for the whole package to be completed or whatever .

@@13436434 @2036434/ <h> Excerpts from the Department of Justice report on the Baltimore Police Department <p> The Department of Justice issued a rebuke of the Baltimore Police Department Wednesday , releasing a 163-page report that accuses the department of discrimination , excessive use of force , and other violations of federal law . <p> Below are headers and excerpts from that report . <p> Racial Disparities in BPD 's Enforcement <p> BPD 's data show that these stops are concentrated on a small segment of the City 's population . From 2010 " 2014 , BPD officers in the Western and Central Districts recorded more than 111,500 stops " roughly 44 percent of the total stops for which officers recorded a district location . Yet these are the two least populated police districts in Baltimore , with a combined population of only 75,000 , or 12 percent of City residents . These districts include the City 's central business district and several poor , urban neighborhoods with mostly African-American residents . In these districts , police recorded nearly 1.5 stops per resident over a four-year period . This data reveals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public streets and sidewalks . Indeed , the data show that one African-American man was stopped 34 times during this period in the Central and Western Districts alone , and several hundred residents were stopped at least 10 times . Countless individuals " including Freddie Gray " were stopped multiple times in the same week without being charged with a crime . <p> In some cases , unconstitutional stops result from supervisory officers ' explicit instructions . During a ride-along with Justice Department officials , a BPD sergeant instructed a patrol officer to stop a group of young African-American males on a street corner , question them , and order them to disperse . When the patrol officer protested that he had no valid reason to stop the group , the sergeant replied " Then make something up . " <p> Nevertheless , our investigation found that BPD officers frequently ignore these requirements and strip-search individuals prior to arrest , in public view , or both . Numerous Baltimore residents interviewed by the Justice Department recounted stories of BPD officers " jumping out " of police vehicles and strip-searching individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such allegations : in the last five years BPD has faced multiple lawsuits and more than 60 complaints alleging unlawful strip searches . In one of these incidents " memorialized in a complaint that the Department sustained " officers in BPD 's Eastern District publicly strip-searched a woman following a routine traffic stop for a missing headlight . Officers ordered the woman to exit her vehicle , remove her clothes , and stand on the sidewalk to be searched . The woman asked the male officer in charge " I really got ta take all my clothes off ? " The male officer replied " yeah " and ordered a female officer to strip search the woman . The female officer then put on purple latex gloves , pulled up the woman 's shirt and searched around her bra . Finding no weapons or contraband around the woman 's chest , the officer then pulled down the woman 's underwear and searched her anal cavity . This search again found no evidence of wrongdoing and the officers released the woman without charges . Indeed , the woman received only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full view of the street , although the supervising male officer claimed he " turned away " and did not watch the woman disrobe . After the woman filed a complaint , BPD investigators corroborated the woman 's story with testimony from several witnesses and by recovering the female officer 's latex gloves from the search location . Officers conducted this highly invasive search despite lacking any indication that the woman had committed a criminal offense or possessed concealed contraband . The male officer who ordered the search received only a " simple reprimand " and an instruction that he could not serve as an officer in charge until he was " properly trained . " <p> BPD Uses Unreasonable Force <p> For example , in a 2014 incident , an officer informed a young man , Matthew , that he could not smoke inside a public market and asked him to leave . Matthew left and the officer followed him outside . Once outside , the officer asked him for identification to issue a civil citation . According to the Department 's use of force report , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer , attracting a crowd . The young man refused to provide identification and moved backward . The officer grabbed the young man by his jacket , at which point he pulled away and fled . Two officers pursued Matthew for blocks and when they eventually caught up with him , " used arrest and control techniques " to tackle him and " stop him from further fleeing . " " While trying to control him on the ground and place him in handcuffs , " he " sustained abrasions to the left and right side of his face and a cut to his upper lip , " requiring two stitches . The officer arrested Matthew for being " disorderly , " but according to the arrest database that BPD provided , the State 's Attorney 's Office declined to formally charge the young man . <p> BPD Uses Unreasonable Force Against Juveniles <p> In another incident , in 2010 , two officers approached a group of individuals who were standing on a sidewalk in a residential neighborhood and " verbally warned this small crowd to disperse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of their home , remaining outside . When one of the officers approached Brian 's sister to " warn her about loitering , " she informed the officers , yelling and cursing , that she lived in the house . The officers did not appear to dispute her claim that she lived in the house . Their reports do not show that any effort was made to confirm whether it was her home . Nevertheless , the officers continued to " warn " her to leave and " cease causing a disturbance . " They eventually attempted to arrest her for " non-compliance . " One of the officers walked up the steps of the siblings ' stoop to attempt to make the arrest . Brian attempted to block the officer , and the officer began to " struggle " with the juvenile . According to civilian witness statements that are summarized in the Department 's reports , the officer punched Brian in the face . The officer also used oleoresin capsicum , or " OC " spray , against both siblings and arrested them for loitering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officer 's uses of force against the siblings , who were standing on or in front of their own property , were unreasonable . These individuals were placed into the criminal justice system for standing on their own steps . <p> In one such incident , in 2010 , several officers responded to a call from the father of a man , " James , " in mental health crisis . The father informed the officers that James was the subject of an emergency petition , had a history of mental illness and hospitalization , and was unarmed . The petition itself indicated that James was not taking his medication , wearing a winter coat in hot weather , and yelling at people on the street and his father . When they could not convince James to open the door , officers attempted to pry the door open with a crowbar , then sprayed two bursts of mace in an attempt to force him out of the apartment . Once inside , a lieutenant deployed his taser in probe mode , striking James , when he resisted being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and there is no indication in the force report that he was a threat himself or the officers other than resisting handcuffing , the officers resorted to a high-level of force to detain the man . <p> Indeed , many BPD supervisors who were trained under the prior enforcement paradigm continue to encourage officers to prioritize short-term suppression , including aggressive use of stops , frisks , and misdemeanor arrests . A current BPD sergeant recently endorsed this approach to policing , posting on Facebook that the " solution to the murder rate is easy . Flex cuffs and a line at Central Booking . CJIS code 2-0055 . " CJIS 2-0055 is the offense code entered for loitering arrests . Similarly , a flyer celebrating loitering arrests was posted in several BPD districts . The flyer depicted three officers from one of BPD 's specialized units known as Violent Crime Impact Division , or VCID , leading a handcuffed man wearing a hoodie along a city sidewalk towards a police transport van , with the text " VCID : Striking fear into loiters sic City-wide .

In early 2016 , a Foxtrot unit alerted patrol officers that a group of young African-American men were playing dice on a street corner . Officers on the ground responded to this intelligence by confronting the group and arresting one of the men , who was charged solely with " playing dice . " <p> Evidence of Gender Bias in BPD 's Response to Sexual Assault <p> For instance , officers and detectives in BPD 's Sex Offense Unit often question victims in a manner that puts the blame for the sexual assault on the victim 's shoulders " for example , with questions suggesting the victims should feel personally responsible for the potential consequences of a criminal report on a suspect or for having engaged in behavior that invited the assault . In their interviews of women reporting sexual assault , for example , BPD detectives ask questions such as " Why are you messing that guy 's life up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate the First Amendment by arresting individuals who question the lawfulness of their actions . In one reported use of force , an officer described the arrest of a man who approached him during a traffic stop to ask why the officer had stopped his friend . The proffered justification for the arrest was that the man refused to leave the area when ordered to do so by the officer . Nothing in the officer 's report indicates that the man physically interfered with the officer 's duty or was otherwise committing a crime . He was arrested merely because he continued to stand " near " the officer . <p> These delays not only impede effective investigations , they communicate to the community that BPD does not take complaints seriously " even those alleging egregious officer behavior . For example , a man alleged in 2013 that two plainclothes officers punched him in the face , placed him in a chokehold , and spit in his face during an arrest . The man , whose arrest prosecutors declined to pursue , participated in a formal interview at IID during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to the incident , and the witness 's wife , who could help investigators locate him . The investigator made no effort to follow up with the civilian witness until eight months after the incident occurred . At that time , the investigator went to the car wash where the witness 's wife had been working at the time of the incident and was told by the owner that she was no longer employed there . The investigator then recommended to close the complaint as " not sustained " because " without testimony from independent witnesses , " along with the officers ' denial , " there exists insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the allegations . " <p> In another incident from 2010 , an African-American man stated that he witnessed officers use excessive force during an arrest and punch a fourteen-year-old boy who attempted to film the arrest on his cell phone . The African-American man recounted that the officers used " the word ' n****r ' frequently " and asked him if he " takes it up the ass by Allah . " When the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was met by the same officers who told him , " what brings your black ass back here ? " and " you can take your black ass down to Kirk Avenue before the bus leaves because you know how you black people like the bus . " Despite the seriousness of the allegations and the fact that the complaint identified two witnesses , BPD never investigated the incident 's alleged racial motivation . Instead , detectives categorized the allegations as " misconduct , " " excessive force , " and " unwarranted action , " and administratively closed the case without conducting a single interview . 
@@13436436 @2036436/ <p> When the concept of paying doctors to help patients plan for end-of-life care first came up as part of health reform , opponents thumped it as a step toward " death panels " and " pulling the plug on grandma . " <p> Advance care planning was scuttled then , but seven years later , it has been rather quietly incorporated into services reimbursable by Medicare . Patients now can seek guidance from their physicians and other health care professionals about what they want and do n't want in terms of life-sustaining or life-prolonging care and have it included in their medical records . <p> But codifying what many describe as a sea change in thinking may have come about too quietly . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , known as CMS , ca n't say how many physicians have billed for these conversations since the provision took effect Jan. 1 , but a poll released in April showed only about 14 percent of doctors who regularly treat patients over 65 have submitted such bills to Medicare . <p> While that indicates physicians either do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations , said Angela Hult , executive director of Oregon-based Cambia Health Foundation , one of three poll sponsors , the public is very solidly in favor . <p> The California Health Care Foundation , another sponsor , found in a 2012 survey that 80 percent of respondents said it would be important to talk to doctors about their final wishes if they were seriously i 'll , and 60 percent said it was " extremely important " that their families not be burdened by tough decisions , like stopping nutrition or breathing assistance . <p> ACP , also called end-of-life directives , is gaining steam among nonprofits , foundations and academic institutions focusing on patient-centered care that also can help health systems be more efficient and save money . Books such as best-seller " Being Mortal " by Massachusetts surgeon Atul Gawande , and " Hope for a Cool Pillow " by Illinois anesthesiologist Margaret Overton use personal experiences to advocate for change in health care of the elderly and raise the profile of what all families eventually face but few typically talk about before a crisis . <p> Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can cause emotional rifts in a family even as time is of the essence , serves both patient and caregivers . A 40-year nurse , commenting in a blog post about the absence of ACP wrote : " It has been the cause of severe moral distress among my nurse colleagues in the ICU and the source of many personal nightmares over the years . It is so very frightening to think what we do to the elderly , in particular , " by mustering medical technology to prolong life when that might not be desired . <p> Physicians even have a term for it " the luge ride , said Michael Preodor , a palliative care doctor at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge . <p> " It 's more surgery , more disease intervention , without fixing the problem , " Preodor said .

" Now there 's time for closure , time with family free of pain , time to deal with dying , which we do n't do very well in this country . " <p> Gundersen Health System in La Crosse , Wis. , has been working more than 20 years to change that . Bud Hammes , an ethicist who started the Respecting Choices program that is cited by many as a model for advance care planning , said more than 96 percent of the 120,000 people in La Crosse County have plans in place before death on how they want to be treated as their health declines .

The Huskies had a new coach , Jim Calhoun , who was going to change the program forever , and the NCAA had made the three-point basket universal , setting the arc at 19 feet , 9 inches . This would forever change college basketball in many ways , some anticipated " more scoring , more spacing , greater opportunity for comebacks " and some not . <p> " It has a place , " Calhoun said , " but it should n't be a dominant place " and it has become that .

Cliff Robinson , a center , took the first , on UConn 's fourth possession in the season opener on Nov. 29 , and Gamble had the only make in that game . <p> " Coach drew up a set play for it , " Gamble said . " It was our ' three play . ' The two big guys would come out to the corners of the foul line , the elbows . Point guard Tate George would have the ball , and if he dribbled one way , I would run the other . Then I 'd fake and go to the top of the key , between the big men , and take a straight-on three . I 'd have to look down and watch my toes because they could n't be touching the line . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to rely on it . <p> " I do n't think teams were really sure how to utilize it , " said Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell , who led UConn in three-point attempts with 36 in 1986-87 .

" <p> Providence , coached by Rick Pitino and led on the floor by Billy Donovan , averaged 19.5 three-point shots per game and did make the Final Four in 1987 , and before long the three-pointer had a permanent and prominent place . <p> " It 's opened up the floor , " said Howie Dickenman , recently retired Central Connecticut coach and a UConn assistant in 1986-87 .

It 's a totally different game , and I think coaching is more difficult . " <p> " The mid-range game has disappeared , " Dickenman said . " Nobody takes the 15- to 17-foot jump shot any more . I think Rip Hamilton was the last great mid-range player at UConn . " <p> Said Pikiell : " Even when you watch young kids , everybody wants to either dunk , or shoot the three . When I was playing , only guards took the three . Now , even the center wants to step out and shoot it .

Calhoun thinks it 's time to move the line again , closer to NBA range . <p> " I think they should move the line back , " he said , " which would open up the middle more , by the way , and then , at least , you would have guys taking threes who could make them from that distance .

@@13436448 @2036448/ <h> Trump 's parade of retired generals raises questions <p> The military parade for Donald Trump has come early . Two months before Inauguration Day festivities , an extraordinary number of recently retired generals , including some who clashed with President Barack Obama 's administration , are marching to the president-elect 's doorstep for job interviews . <p> It 's not unusual for an incoming administration to consider a retired general for a top position like CIA director . But Trump has turned to retired officers so publicly and in such large numbers that it raises questions about the proper balance of military and civilian advice in a White House led by a commander in chief with no defense or foreign policy experience . <p> The tilt toward military officials may reflect a limited pool of civilian options . Many officials from previous Republican administrations politically disowned Trump during the campaign , calling him unqualified . And Trump suggested he would n't want many of them , as he vowed to " drain the swamp " by running establishment figures out of town . <p> Robert Goldich , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , says Trump 's focus on retired generals might be unprecedented . <p> The only one announced for a top job thus far is Michael Flynn , a retired three-star Army general .

It 's common sense to seek the experience of those who have proven they know how to fight , " he said in an email exchange . <p> The concern about undue military influence derives from a long U.S. tradition of civilian control of the military , which is the basis for a ban on active-duty officers running the Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commander in chief and giving Congress the authority to declare war and fund the military . <p> The appointment of too many generals to high civilian positions could prompt fears that Trump is on a path to militarizing U.S. foreign policy or giving the military too much sway in decisions about war and peace . <p> But that view was rejected by Richard Fontaine , president of the Center for a New American Security , a Washington think tank . In an interview , he noted that it was President George W.

" It was an announcement that kicked off three surreal hours in which the Knicks were routed at home by the New Orleans Pelicans and no one , from reporters covering the league to his teammates to the coaching staff and team executives , had any idea where he was . <p> Eventually , Joakim Noah -- Rose 's longtime teammate and friend -- told reporters he 'd spoken to Rose after the game , and that he was all right . But that was after Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek had met with the media members and seemed to have no information about Rose 's whereabouts . <p> " That 's just going to have to wait until we hear from Derrick himself , " Hornacek said . Teammates said they had no idea where their starting point guard was , and they simply hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose raises plenty of questions regarding his as-of-yet unexplained absence , his future with the Knicks and that of the team itself . <p> While Rose has told people he 's all right , details have been scarce , and the lack of an explanation is a problem for Rose moving forward . Of course , everyone hopes that he and his family are okay . But no one would have had a problem if he 'd needed to address a personal matter and taken leave from the team -- as long as he 'd actually told someone about the issue . There have been countless times where someone , be it a player or coach , has needed to go take care of a family situation , and no one would ever stop anyone from doing so . <p> NBA point guard Derrick Rose went from league MVP for the Chicago Bulls to teammates with Carmelo Anthony on the New York Knicks . <p> NBA point guard Derrick Rose went from league MVP for the Chicago Bulls to teammates with Carmelo Anthony on the New York Knicks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened for shoot-around at the team 's practice facility in the suburbs north of New York on Monday morning , there was no hint Rose would be absent from the game . He was present at shoot-around , and when Hornacek met with members of the media less than two hours before Monday 's game , only one player -- rookie forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas -- was said to be unavailable . <p> The lack of information puts Rose in a potentially problematic situation and leaves his team sorting through additional drama as it tries to right itself from losing eight of its last night games . When , or if , Rose does return , he will have to address questions both from his teammates , the media and the fans in New York . And his answers need to be satisfactory if he wants to not endanger his status on the team . <p> The truth is that Rose needs the Knicks more than the Knicks need him at this point . Despite his resume , which includes being the No. 1 overall pick in 2008 and the NBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a player to be feared by opposing teams . Yes , he 's proven he can still score this season , as he 's averaging 17.3 points per game . But Rose 's defense has been below average , and his lack of a three-point shot ( he 's shooting 24.5 percent , and is a career 30 percent shooter from behind the arc ) leaves him at odds with the modern NBA , where effective shooting at virtually every position -- up to and including at center -- is vital . <p> Set to enter unrestricted free agency for the first time in his career this summer , Rose needed to prove he could be a difference-maker after being acquired by the Knicks this summer from the Chicago Bulls for a package of Robin Lopez , Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon . The fact Rose spent most of training camp in Los Angeles as a defendant in a civil rape trial , in which he was eventually found not liable , only made the need for a fresh start all the more apparent . <p> Instead , Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years in Chicago in the wake of two lost seasons to knee injuries -- a decent scorer who does little else . That 's a player without much demand in today 's NBA . <p> And all of that was before Rose disappeared Monday and the Knicks continued their recent tailspin in as ignominious a way as possible . Between Rose 's disappearance , Carmelo Anthony and Kyle O'Quinn both being ejected and at one point trailing by 29 points at home against a Pelicans team 10 games below .500 , it does n't get much uglier than it did at Madison Square Garden Monday . <p> Derrick Rose has returned to practice with the New York Knicks after missing their game the night before for what he described as family reasons . <p> The Knicks ' public relations department posted a photo on Twitter on Tuesday that showed Rose in his No. 25 practice jersey , standing with his teammates ... <p> Derrick Rose has returned to practice with the New York Knicks after missing their game the night before for what he described as family reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Twitter on Tuesday that showed Rose in his No. 25 practice jersey , standing with his teammates ... <p> ( Tribune news services ) <p> So where does everyone go from here ? As dawn breaks , details remain scarce about Rose 's situation , and it would be helpful for everyone to hear from Knicks president Phil Jackson . But given Jackson 's two most recent public interactions with the media have consisted of him commenting on LeBron James and his " posse " and then subsequently criticizing Anthony , it seems unlikely Jackson is about to break his silence with the team 's beat writers anytime soon -- particularly given a potentially delicate situation . However , these instances are precisely the kind Jackson should handle , given he 's being paid $12 million a year to be the face of the organization . <p> A suspension for Rose could be possible , but that would require him rejoin his teammates . There has been no indication when -- or if -- that will happen as of now . There 's already been speculation of trouble between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of undrafted rookie Ron Baker at the end of Friday 's game in Milwaukee . Given that is the only win the Knicks have had in the past two weeks and Baker 's play in the fourth helped swing it in New York 's direction , it 's hard to fault Hornacek for how he 's handled his point guard . <p> A buyout is another possibility , given Rose is on an expiring contract , but given he was already starting for the Knicks , and it did n't appear that was going to change anytime soon , it 's hard to see how getting bought out and going elsewhere would do anything to help his status heading into the summer . Instead , it would only add to the baggage Rose is currently toting as he tries to land another lucrative contract in free agency . <p> In trading for Rose and then subsequently signing Courtney Lee and Noah to big-money contracts in free agency , the Knicks hoped to surround Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis with the kind of talent necessary to turn the Knicks back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply reverted the Knicks back into the same ridiculous mess they 've been for virtually all of the past 15 years . Now they have a point guard that has gone missing , a center in Noah who is the runaway winner for both worst contract of the summer -- one that has over three years remaining -- and now has Anthony leading the league in ejections after getting tossed for the third time during Monday 's loss . <p> For all of their problems , however , even after Monday 's loss , the Knicks are two games out of seventh place in the Eastern Conference , and three games out of fifth . Losing eight of nine may make it seem like the season is over , but in the Eastern Conference it just means its the Knicks ' turn for a slide down the standings , and there 's plenty of time to right the ship . <p> The question now is whether Derrick Rose will be part of those efforts . After the way Monday played out , its anyone 's guess what will happen next .

Evidence produced via the Freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , but allowed Nassar to remain on staff , treating women . Thursday 's revelations could rebut any claims that USA Gymnastics turned a blind eye to Nassar or was slow to respond to claims of abuse . <p> According to the timeline USA Gymnastics released Thursday , the organization " first learned of an athlete 's concern " on June 17 , 2015 . CEO Steve Penny , who was returning home from a pre-Olympic visit to Rio de Janeiro , spoke with an unidentified athlete 's mother days later . USA Gymnastics hired an investigator to conduct follow-up interviews , and five weeks later , on July 24 , that investigator recommended the organization contact law enforcement and report Nassar . <p> Penny , along with USA Gymnastics board chairman Paul Parilla , the vice chairman , and the organization 's attorneys met with FBI agents in Indianapolis on July 28 , and the next day Nassar was relieved " of any further assignments , " according to the organization 's timeline of events . <p> " During the course of the FBI investigation , USA Gymnastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's request not to take any action that would interfere with the Bureau 's investigation , " the organization 's statement read in part . " Keeping athletes safe requires sustained vigilance by everyone - coaches , athletes , parents , administrators and officials - and there is more work to be done . We are determined to strengthen standards throughout the sport . " <p> According to USA Gymnastics ' timeline , Parilla contacted the FBI in April 2016 , when officials became concerned about the lack of updates on the case . The next month Parilla and Penny again met with federal agents . <p> The accusations would become public less than three months later , though USA Gymnastics did not speak in detail about its role in reporting Nassar to authorities until Thursday . <p> John Manly , a California-based lawyer who represents more than three dozen gymnasts alleging abuse , including the one who kicked off the USA Gymnastics inquiry , said the six-week lag between USA Gymnastics hearing the initial complaint and then turning to law enforcement is indefensible and inconsistent with the organization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning of athletes ' concerns . <p> " They 're actually acting like they 're responsible for him being caught , " Manly said . " Nothing could be further from the truth . They delayed this , did their own investigation and then want to blame the FBI for not acting on it for 13 months . . . . " <p> " The fact that they 're still acting like they do n't have any culpability for this and still being secretive and duplicitous about it is abhorrent . " <p> Before last year , Nassar was a revered figure in American gymnastics . He is a nationally renowned expert on gymnastics injuries and rehabilitation . He served as the team physician for the U.S. men 's and women 's Olympic gymnastics team from 1996 to 2015 , working four Olympic Games in that time . He was a sports medicine physician and a faculty member in MSU 's Division of Sports Medicine in the College of Osteopathic Medicine .

One of the alleged victims , a Kentucky woman named Rachael Denhollander , went to Michigan State police and filed a report against Nassar in August . <p> Michigan State suspended him and then fired him in September . <p> Michigan State has confirmed that a former student alleged that Nassar assaulted her during a medical procedure in 2014 , and that an investigation was conducted but did not result in a criminal charge . After that incident , according to records in Nassar 's personnel file , Michigan State allowed him to keep his job but put in place restrictions over the treatment he had offered that prompted the complaint . <p> Nassar was not paid by USA Gymnastics , but his work for the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual contracts with the university , records show , Nassar was allowed to spend up to 70 percent of his time doing " outreach/public service " work through USA Gymnastics and local high schools and gymnastics clubs . <p> His association with the Olympic women 's gymnastics team was central to Nassar 's prominence as a physician . His office was decorated in signed pictures of Olympians , and one alleged victim said Nassar gave her gifts including a commemorative pin he received from USA Gymnastics for participation in the Olympic games . <p> Two members of the 2012 Olympic gold medal winning team - Jordyn Wieber and McKayla Maroney - credited Nassar 's medical savvy with helping them compete through injuries that year . <p> " We would never survive without him , " Wieber told the Lansing State Journal in 2012 .

( Chicago Tribune ) <p> As cities across the nation overhaul their aging water systems by digging up lead water pipes connecting homes to street mains , Chicago administration officials say it is up to individual homeowners to decide whether it is worth replacing the pipes at their own expense . ( Chicago Tribune ) <p> As cities across the nation overhaul their aging , increasingly fragile drinking water systems , some municipal leaders are digging deeper to erase a toxic legacy that endangers millions of Americans : lead water pipes connecting homes to street mains . <p> The growing list includes Milwaukee , Boston , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Denver and St. Paul , all of which are adding pipe replacements to municipal construction projects by dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of low-interest loans funded jointly by federal and state lawmakers . Other cities have plans in the works . <p> Chicago has more lead service lines than any other city and required them by law until 1986 , when Congress banned the use of the brain-damaging metal to convey drinking water . But as Mayor Rahm Emanuel pushes ahead with expensive plans to modernize Chicago 's water system , administration officials say it is up to individual homeowners to decide whether it is worth replacing the pipes at their own expense . <p> Of the $412 million Emanuel has borrowed from a federal-state loan fund during the past six years for water-related projects , none is going to replace lead pipes . <p> Instead , more than two-thirds of the money has been earmarked to replace 440 miles of aging water mains " work that helps prevent leaks but can inadvertently increase the chances Chicagoans are exposed to lead in their drinking water . <p> The Emanuel administration has increased the amount borrowed and number of mains replaced each year , even after a 2013 study of Chicago homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines are disturbed by street work , high levels of lead can flow out of household taps for weeks or months afterward . <p> Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune <p> Jeff Steele , a plumber with Chicago 's water department , attaches a copper service line to an existing lead service line in a repair done while replacing water mains Sept. 15 , 2016 , in the 1500 block of West Roscoe Street . <p> Jeff Steele , a plumber with Chicago 's water department , attaches a copper service line to an existing lead service line in a repair done while replacing water mains Sept. 15 , 2016 , in the 1500 block of West Roscoe Street . ( Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune ) <p> " Residents are paying a horrible price for Chicago ignoring overwhelming scientific evidence of health concerns , " said Marc Edwards , a Virginia Tech researcher who played a major role in uncovering lead hazards in Flint , Mich. , last year and Washington , D.C. , in 2003 . " If they were honest about the dangers ... it is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " <p> In June , the Emanuel administration borrowed another $120.6 million " the biggest loan deal yet for the mayor 's project . Emanuel has emphasized the importance of the work by showing visitors to his City Hall office a bored-out log that once carried water through the Loop , a not-uncommon discovery in the city 's oldest neighborhoods . <p> Each time city crews and contractors dig up a Chicago street to replace a water main , they connect new cast iron pipes to existing lead service lines between the roadway and individual houses . The projects ensure " residents have modern and reliable water service " and provide " the maximum benefit to the greatest number of people , " the Department of Water Management wrote in an email response to questions . <p> Asked why the city does n't replace lead service lines at the same time , city officials have repeatedly said there is no proof Chicagoans are at risk . " There is no scientific data surrounding the impact of construction on water quality , " Gary Litherland , a water department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city announced plans last month to conduct its own research . <p> The mayor 's office declined to answer specific questions . " We are working with the state and federal authorities on these issues and will be reviewing all options to ensure the continued delivery of safe drinking water , " an Emanuel spokeswoman said Friday in a prepared statement . <p> By contrast , after testing in Milwaukee last year found results similar to the EPA 's 2013 Chicago study , city leaders there announced plans to begin borrowing money for lead pipe replacements . They also stopped installing new water mains on streets with lead service lines , projects the local health commissioner said pose an " unacceptable and involuntary risk to the public . " <p> The EPA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there is no safe level of exposure to lead . Tiny amounts can permanently damage the brains of young children , leading to learning disabilities and violent behavior later in life . <p> Like other cities , Chicago and Milwaukee add corrosion-fighting chemicals to the water supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the metal from leaching out . But the coating can break off if lead pipes are disturbed , according to studies by industry scientists and academic researchers . <p> Stung by criticism of its slow reaction to the Flint crisis , the EPA has sent a series of letters to state regulators advising them to do more to warn the public about potential health risks from lead pipes and encouraging them to find ways to begin addressing the problem that go beyond the minimum requirements . <p> Though Chicago and other cities consider service lines to be private property rather than part of the municipal water system , no law or regulation prevents the use of federal money to replace them , EPA lawyers wrote earlier this year in an internal memo shared with states . <p> " Lead pipes can contaminate water at any point , including on its way into a private home , " the memo concluded . " Allowing a public water system to use its funds to replace such pipes is consistent with ... the overall health protections of the Safe Drinking Water Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes remain underground . Earlier this month , Mayor Tom Barrett said anyone living in a home built before 1951 should install water filters capable of removing lead . The city also is planning to borrow $2.6 million from the federal-state loan fund to replace lead pipes , starting with 385 day care centers . <p> " This is a matter of statewide public health concern for all utilities that have lead service lines , " Carrie Lewis , the Milwaukee public works superintendent , wrote in a January letter asking state officials for financial assistance . <p> Madison , Wis. , already has removed nearly all of its lead service lines , in part by offering to pay up to $1,000 of the replacement costs . Lansing , Mich. , charges ratepayers for its replacement program and has developed cheaper and more efficient methods to complete the work . Philadelphia and St. Paul offer no-interest payment plans . <p> In Boston , residents can consult an online map of lead service lines , and the city offers its own cash incentives . " If the service line is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the health of people in the building , " the city states in a brochure outlining its program . <p> Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune <p> Laborers with the city 's department of water management work to replace aging water main lines on Sept. 15 , 2016 in the 1500 block of West Roscoe Street in Chicago . <p> Laborers with the city 's department of water management work to replace aging water main lines on Sept. 15 , 2016 in the 1500 block of West Roscoe Street in Chicago . <p> ( Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune ) <p> Chicago has no such inventory of lead service lines , and the city has asked a Cook County judge to throw out a lawsuit seeking a court-ordered replacement program . Lawyers for the three initial plaintiffs say the city " interfered with their private property " by requiring lead service lines for decades after other cities stopped using pipes made of the toxic metal . <p> Replacing service lines in Chicago certainly would be daunting given the city 's estimate that nearly 80 percent of homes and small apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead pipes . <p> If roughly 385,000 lead service lines remain in Chicago , and replacing them would cost $3,800 on average based on estimates in other cities , embarking on such a program could cost at least $1.4 billion . <p> Congress created the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund in 1996 to improve and maintain public water systems . The fund requires states to contribute an amount equal to 20 percent of what each gets annually from the federal program . <p> This year , Illinois pre-approved $430 million in federal-state loans for drinking water projects . Of that amount , $148 million is designated for Chicago , most of it for the water main repairs . <p> The city will pay back the 20-year loans using money from an increase in water rates approved shortly after Emanuel took office . At interest rates averaging 1.86 percent , the borrowing is significantly less expensive than other debt the city has taken on to fund municipal operations . <p> A separate tax on water and sewer bills , approved by the City Council last week at Emanuel 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects . <p> The first community in Illinois to secure funding for lead pipe replacements through the federal-state loan fund is Galesburg , a downstate city that has struggled for years to adequately maintain its anti-corrosion treatment . U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos , a Moline Democrat , suggested the idea after the EPA advised Galesburg to distribute water filters to any home where testing found high levels of lead in tap water . <p> The $4 million borrowed by Galesburg will replace about half of the 10,000 lead pipes remaining in the city , said Mayor John Pritchard . Homeowners will be asked to sign waivers allowing crews to dig up their yards , with the city focusing initially on properties where high lead levels have been detected in tap water or where a child has been diagnosed with lead poisoning . <p> " There 's money available to take care of the pipes , and it 's going to put people to work , " Pritchard said . " You would be crazy not to take it . " <p> Alec Messina , director of the Illinois EPA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafting plans to include service line replacements in more projects throughout Illinois . The state has more lead pipes remaining than any other . <p> " More states and communities will start looking at this program as part of the solution , " Messina said in an interview . <p> One reason why Chicago and most other cities have n't been required to replace service lines is there is no federal limit on the amount of lead in tap water at individual homes , though the EPA has announced it will propose a " household action level " by year 's end . For now , a water utility can be ordered to make repairs only if it repeatedly exceeds a systemwide benchmark intended to gauge the effectiveness of anti-corrosion treatment . <p> Chicago officials say corrosion control in the city is effective , basing their assurances of safety on 50 federally mandated lead tests conducted every three years . <p> The Tribune first reported in February that few of the tests were carried out on streets where a water main has been replaced , the vast majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired from the water department , and none of the tests was conducted in areas of the city where childhood lead poisoning remains a problem . <p> Since the federal study in Chicago " carried out with the assistance of the water department " research in Milwaukee and other cities also has found spikes of lead in drinking water following the installation of new street mains . <p> With Chicago at the halfway point of Emanuel 's water main replacement program , administration officials last month said they would conduct their own study because , according to a mayoral spokeswoman , " it is misleading at best to say there is federal research concluding that construction causes high lead levels in water . " <p> Volunteers will be enlisted to have their water tested before and after streets are dug up , according to a city news release . Citing pending litigation , the water department on Friday declined to provide a copy of its study protocol . <p> The city currently advises residents affected by water main replacements to flush their taps for a few minutes any time water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and February the fliers omitted any reference to lead , the Tribune found , and suggested that homeowners flush taps just once after the water main work was complete . <p> The city also offers free water testing and since May has been sending residents test kits they can mail to a laboratory for analysis . Results posted online show widely ranging levels in the first liter of drawn water " from less than 1 part per billion to as high as 272 parts per billion . <p> Jeffrey K. Griffiths , a Tufts University researcher and former chair of the EPA advisory panel on drinking water issues , said the only effective solution is for Chicago and other cities to begin the long , costly work of replacing lead service lines . <p> Griffiths gives a lecture to students once a year about the history of lead , cautioning them it will be one of the most depressing talks they ever hear . <p> " Because it 's all bad , " Griffiths said .

@@13436531 @2036531/ <p> Certain periods of history have proved to be catnip to contemporary historical novelists . Medieval and Victorian England , the settling of the American West , both world wars " all have been fertile ground for the fictional imagination . And in recent years , the artistic milieu of the Netherlands in the 17th century " the so-called Golden Age of Dutch painting " has come on strong in novels such as Tracy Chevalier 's " Girl With a Pearl Earring " ( 1999 ) and , more recently and indirectly , Donna Tartt 's Pulitzer Prize-winning " The Goldfinch " ( 2013 ) . <p> Now comes " The Last Painting of Sara de Vos , " by the Australian-American novelist Dominic Smith , in which a painting by a fictional ( though historically plausible ) woman painter of the Golden Age becomes the center of not just one drama but three dramas in three different centuries . Sara de Vos , the first woman admitted to Amsterdam 's all-powerful Guild of St. Luke , paints the haunting image " At the Edge of a Wood " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fever . It later plays a profound role in the lives and careers of one of her descendants , a New York lawyer named Marty de Groot , and Ellie Shipley , a renowned art historian who , as a struggling graduate student , once created a forgery of the painting . <p> Printers Row recently caught up with Smith , 45 , for a phone interview from his home in Austin , Texas . Here 's an edited transcript of our chat . <p> Q : You 're an Australian by birth , so it makes sense that Australia does figure in your novel . It 's natural , I suppose , that it 's partly set in Sydney . <p> A : ( Laughs . ) I 've been getting closer , in my novels , to Australian soil , in terms of setting actual scenes and chapters there , and this is probably the closest I 've gotten in a while . It seemed like once I knew that my Australian art historian and forger was from Sydney , and she would return there at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , in 2000 , and what it might mean in her life as it 's unraveling . It could have been in some other places , but Sydney is part of her history as a character , part of her back-story . <p> Q : How did you come to this subject matter ? I ask in part because art history , art restoration and art forgery are trending topics in contemporary fiction " Donna Tartt 's " The Goldfinch " being the best-known recent example . <p> A : I actually came to this material about 15 years ago , when I was living in Amsterdam . It was my first experience of the Dutch Golden Age up close , and I think my sense of what that looked like in painting was really Vermeer and Rembrandt , and maybe Frans Hals . What I discovered was that there are all these missing layers of the Dutch Golden Age that most people do n't know about . By some estimates , there were 50,000 painters at work in the 17th century in Holland , and of that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guild of St. Luke 's , the main painters ' guild . We only have a small handful of paintings that have survived from them , and so I got really interested in this idea of lost painters of the Golden Age . Certainly " The Goldfinch " is a great novel , and " Girl With a Pearl Earring . " But this novel is quite different in that it is really about missing painters from the Golden Age , imagining the life of a woman artist admitted to the guild and tracing the chronology of her painting over three different centuries and three different storylines . <p> Q : There are interesting parallels between the lives of Sara de Vos , the painter , and Ellie Shipley , the curator who once forged a copy of Sara 's masterpiece . The book has a somewhat feminist perspective on both of them , it seems to me . <p> A : I do n't think I set out to have a feminist thematic backbone , but certainly there are two women , separated by centuries , who face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the Guild of St. Luke was tightly controlled by men , including what women were allowed to paint , based on what we 've seen . The running of the bureaucracy of the Guild really meant that a painter like Judith Leyster , who was a real person , was kind of lost for 200 years . All of her paintings were attributed either to her husband or to Frans Hals . So certainly there was a lot of paternalism toward the few women painters of the day . By the time we get to the 1950s , it 's a different kind of chauvinism . You have a character like Ellie , an Australian who 's had to leave Australia in order to make her mark , and here she is exposed to chauvinism within the discipline of art history . So I was definitely interested in playing around with what these two women faced in their careers in two very different time frames , and exploring not only the differences but also the similarities . <p> Q : They 're both up against the patriarchy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellie would never have been in the position of forging Sara 's painting . <p> A : That 's a great perspective , because both women are hemmed in by the patriarchy , and it drives them to new levels of inventiveness " not always in good ways , in the case of Ellie . But there 's definitely a sense of being thwarted and unrecognized . That idea of recognition and authenticity is something that runs through the whole book . Without the pressure of conforming to the patriarchy , both of their artistic lives might have been quite different . Interestingly , while the guilds in Holland controlled all aspects of a painter 's life , women , paradoxically , also enjoy somewhat equal status with men . For example , Judith Leyster , one of the first women admitted to the Guild , sued Frans Hals for basically poaching her students , and she won the case . So while there was patriarchy , there was also a lot of opportunity for women painters in Holland at that time compared to some other European countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guild of St. Luke were forbidden to paint landscapes ; they were confined to indoor subjects . Is that a known fact , or did you infer it , or just make it up ? <p> A : It 's kind of inferred . What 's interesting is that there are no landscapes by any women painters of this period . The traditional explanation is that women had a very domestic role in that time , so to be unaccompanied for hours sitting outside , whether they were actually painting or sketching a landscape that they would later do in their studios , would have been too much . But I do n't completely buy the simplicity of that . Part of the reason is that there was a woman artist who at the end of the 17th century left her estranged husband in Amsterdam , moved to Surinam in South America , took their daughter , and spent two years in the jungle , sketching botanical specimens . So my argument is , if a woman can do that in the 17th century , she could find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the men in the Guild had decided that they wanted to own landscapes . Whether it was expressly forbidden , or just part of the rules of the day implied in the culture , it 's very hard to say . <p> Q : You 've written historical novels before , most written entirely in the past . In this novel , you bring us much more toward the present , at least in parts of the novel " which is also a bit of a trend in fiction ; I 'm thinking of novels like ( Michael Cunningham 's ) " The Hours . " <p> A : In my own writing , there have always been competing impulses , the contemporary and the historical . I 've written short stories and novels that are historical ; I also wrote a novel set in the world of particle physics . In some ways I wanted to experiment with the freedom to move between those two , and to have a novel that has a historic object at its heart but is also contemporary . This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present tense , which I think is so abused and can be very gimmicky . In this case , it was an attempt to make something both historical and contemporary at the same time . In the book culture of our day , where we want to compartmentalize things , there are these somewhat entrenched categories of historical and contemporary fiction , but I think we 're seeing novels in the past 20 years or so that try to play around with that and have some fun with it . <p> Q : For readers who wo n't have read your novel when they read this interview , could you describe the painting referred to in the title ? <p> A : Sure . At the heart of the novel is a 17th century Dutch painting called " At the Edge of a Wood , " painted by Sara de Vos , the first woman to be admitted to the Guild of St. Luke . She painted it at a moment of loss in her life ; it 's not a plot spoiler to say that she 's lost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial to her . I was interested in thinking through the way that the meaning of art changes over time , so fast forward to 1950s New York , where you have Marty de Groot , a wealthy Manhattan lawyer who has this painting hanging above his bed . He inherited it through his bloodline . It 's stolen from him , but while it 's hanging above his bed , he 's in an unhappy , childless marriage , and has no idea , other than what he sees in the painting , of the circumstances of Sara de Vos . But he takes a strange kind of comfort in this rather haunting landscape , which shows a girl overlooking a frozen river . She 's barefoot , and she seems kind of cut off from the skaters down on the frozen river who are clearly having a great time . And then we pivot to the third storyline , that of Ellie Shipley . What she sees in this painting is the sheer virtuosity of the painter 's skill . There 's something in it that defies what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this time period . And in it , she sees a kind of inspiration for her own career . To me , what was really grounding in this novel was the idea of the landscape at the center , with these three different storylines orbiting around it . <p> Q : There 's also a meditation in the novel on the transcendent possibilities of art . <p> A : Yes , and I think that ties in with the forgery in the book . I think there 's both a physical forgery of a painting and a kind of moral forgery , which I do n't want to talk too much about because of the plot implications . But the Dutch created these incredibly elaborate scenes in their paintings , and you can look at one of those paintings that 's 400 years old and feel that it 's sending us a message through time . But we rarely know the circumstances under which it was painted , and we usually do n't know much about the culture . So what we create is a kind of personal narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore in the book is why a forgery kind of cuts to the core of the art world and why it 's so enduringly fascinating to painting . I think it has to do with the way it violates the narrative we create with art . To stare up at a painting and fall in love with it , and then to discover that it 's false , is a very personal betrayal . <p> Kevin Nance is a Chicago-based freelance writer and photographer whose work appears in the Washington Post , USA Today , Poets &amp; Writers Magazine and other publications .

Taft baseball coach Jim Smilgoff had introduced Hasselman to Krause . <p> Immediately , Krause felt he had found his calling and took great relish in being able to scout in two sports .

Tim Floyd , his handpicked successor when Jackson called the final title season " The Last Dance " and rode off , failed . Krause later called his hiring of Floyd one of his few regrets . <p> But he replaced Floyd with Cartwright , and some minor momentum built . <p> " He changed my life , " said Cartwright , who now works for his alma mater , the University of San Francisco . " First he traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching . I was ready to go into the business world , but he would n't have it . " <p> " He was such a student of the game , " Crawford said .

" He always told me I had so much talent and I just had to harness it . He always talked about how he was going to turn it around . I admired his courage and vision and work .

Despite being distraught over losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north suburban home for a long talk to offer advice and experience . <p> " That was so gracious of him , " Paxson said . " We talked about agents and philosophies . He did n't have to do that . " <p> Twice , Krause earned recognition from his peers as the NBA 's Executive of the Year . The Bulls raised a banner to the United Center rafters on Oct. 31 , 2003 , to honor his contributions . <p> The Bulls will add a patch to their uniforms , perhaps as soon as Wednesday 's game , to recognize Krause . The Toronto Raptors held a moment of silence for Krause before tipoff of Tuesday night 's game against the Bulls . <p> " That dude was a loyal guy , " Cartwright said .

And in late June , police again unspooled the yellow crime scene tape in the alley behind the block after a teen was fatally shot in the head . <p> As Chicago heads into the often violent July Fourth weekend , these kinds of stories are all too common in pockets of the West and South sides .

Shooting incidents have risen by even more , marking the third consecutive year of double-digit increases . <p> While it does n't rank as the nation 's murder capital on a per-capita basis , Chicago is the runaway leader in the sheer volume of killings and shootings . New York and Los Angeles do n't even come close . Through June 19 , Chicago had more homicides than those two larger cities combined , records show . The two combined had fewer than 1,000 shooting victims during that same period , while Chicago by Tuesday topped 1,900 " about 10 a day . <p> A closer look at the numbers shows the intractable hold that violence has in some of Chicago 's 22 police districts . Two of the city 's historically most violent police districts " Harrison and Englewood " account for fully one-fourth of the homicides and shooting incidents . <p> A complex mix of factors is driving the violence .

The U.S. Justice Department is leading a wide-ranging probe of police practices in the wake of a video showing a white officer shooting black teen Laquan McDonald 16 times . The department also was forced into revamping its street stop procedures after the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois raised red flags over whether officers were violating citizens ' civil rights . <p> All this has led many officers to feel unsure about stopping anyone .

Now small cliques battle for control over a few blocks . <p> Veteran officers say the fractured nature of gangs has made life more chaotic on the street , with rivals sometimes living just a few blocks apart . <p> Hatch thinks much of the violence involves retaliatory shootings stemming from so many homicides going unsolved , while police complain of too few witnesses willing to cooperate . <p> " That means you 've got a lot of vigilantism going on out there , " he said .

" West Side is about money . " <p> Experts also agree that personal disputes increasingly are playing a role in the violence . One veteran cop recalled with disbelief recently how a slaying he investigated boiled down to an insult over shoes . <p> Police also said so-called net-banging on social media fuels conflicts .

Gun-related arrests have risen as well , to 1,530 , the department said . <p> Gun pipelines are plentiful for gang members , many of whom can not legally buy firearms because of their criminal records . Gun shows and dealers operating under less stringent laws are a short drive away in northwest Indiana .

More than a dozen legal challenges have been filed around the country , and only one judge so far has indicated that he was willing to let Trump 's order stand . <p> The decision of Robart , who was nominated by President George W.

That means the action may not immediately help those seeking approval . Immigration lawyers said the State Department had informed them they should rebook trips for refugees whose plans were canceled after the executive order , which temporarily halted the refugee resettlement program . <p> On Tuesday , the Department of Homeland Security said it would allow 872 refugees into the country who were " already in transit " and would face " undue hardship " if denied admission . <p> " This ruling is another stinging rejection of President Trump 's unconstitutional Muslim ban , " said Omar Jadwat , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's Immigrants ' Rights Project .

Vice President Mike Pence defended the president 's words in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that will air on ABC 's " This Week . " <p> " I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them , " Pence said . <p> He agreed with Stephanopoulos that Robart had the authority for his ruling , and said " we 'll go through the process in the courts to get a stay of that order , so that , again , we can implement this action that is entirely focused on the safety and security of the American people .

( Max Whittaker / Getty Images ) <p> Silicon Valley and the entertainment and biotech sectors have secured California 's reputation as an investment nirvana . Here 's the other side of a coin : the state is a national leader in divestment actions too . <p> California initiatives aimed at stripping socially unpopular industries out of institutional portfolios include Senate Bill 185 , signed by Gov .

" To have all this divestment happening here helps it take off in other places around the world . " <p> But the fossil fuels divestment movement raises broad questions about divestment in general and the fossil fuels campaign itself . Does divestment work ?

Big industries with long-term prospective value " such as oil and gas " are a harder call for investment managers . <p> From a strictly financial perspective , divestment campaigns may not affect the target industries or companies .

" CalPERS and CalSTRS have a very direct and legal responsibility to the beneficiaries , not to community activists or politicians , " says Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le=n , D-Los Angeles , who sponsored SB 185 .

Beth Brown speaks to members of her fellowship concerning their thoughts on becoming one of Chicago 's sanctuary churches during the annual congregation meeting of Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church on Jan. 29 , 2017 , in the Lincoln Park neighborhood . ( Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune ) <p> Alarmed by President Donald Trump 's campaign proposals to crack down on immigration and subsequent executive orders that called for barring refugees and expediting deportations , hundreds of churches , synagogues and mosques nationwide " and about two dozen in the Chicago area " are considering the bold move to provide sanctuary to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally . <p> " When Trump was elected , it turned into an immediate priority situation , " said the Rev. Beth Brown , pastor of Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are facing deportation a place to stay . <p> As the political climate shifts , immigration activists say the nature of the sanctuary movement could change . Though federal authorities say they will continue to avoid raiding hospitals , schools and houses of worship , activists fear that sacred spaces could become targets under the new administration . Historically aimed at changing policies through public campaigns and protest , the sanctuary movement could be forced underground . <p> Last week , a mother of four with two misdemeanor convictions sought sanctuary in the basement of a Denver church after authorities denied her request for a stay of deportation . How her case plays out could determine how congregations play a role going forward . <p> " It 's about people committing to trying to keep the person safe and out of custody , " Brown said . " If it 's under the radar , if that 's what people are saying is going to save somebody 's life or keep someone from being separated from their family , we 'd follow that guidance . " <p> The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited protections to criminals who sought shelter in temples . From the fourth to 17th centuries , English law granted immunity to fugitives as long as they were inside a church . <p> The more contemporary approach to sanctuary as a political movement in the U.S. first unfolded in the 1980s . Drawing from sacred texts that teach loving thy neighbor and welcoming the stranger , churches and synagogues opened their doors to immigrants fleeing civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala . <p> In 1987 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld conspiracy convictions of several sanctuary ministers . But the same court also cleared the way for many of the Central American immigrants who were living in churches to seek asylum , which was hailed as a victory . <p> The movement resurfaced when deportations began to rise dramatically during the Bush and Obama administrations . <p> In 2006 , Elvira Arellano , a former maintenance worker at O'Hare International Airport , took refuge with her 7-year-old son inside Adalberto United Methodist Church in Humboldt Park . Arrested four years earlier as part of a post-9/11 sweep of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arellano became the face of the new sanctuary movement . <p> The targeted immigration enforcement tactics " go against the grain of what our faith traditions teach us , " said the Rev. Noel Andersen of the New York-based Church World Service , which tracks the sanctuary movement . " We believe that we have a higher calling and that we should respond to a higher law . " <p> A 2011 memo from the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement further empowered the sanctuary movement . Federal agents were instructed to avoid " sensitive locations " including hospitals , schools and houses of worship unless there is an imminent risk . <p> According to Andersen , 250 congregations nationwide signed up to help shield immigrants after raids in 2014 . Roundups in 2016 prompted over 100 more to support the sanctuary movement . Now 800 congregations have stepped up to provide relief , he said . <p> " Certainly there 's more risk involved , and the fact that people are still so interested says a lot , " he added . <p> Gail Montenegro , a spokeswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security , said agents are still expected to abide by the 2011 directive . <p> " DHS is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation , " she said in a statement . <p> Andersen said people are n't just afraid of immigration enforcement . They also worry that political rhetoric might make legal immigrants more susceptible to discrimination , hate crimes or profiling by law enforcement . <p> " What we understand sanctuary to be is expanding , and it is expanding beyond the world of just undocumented immigrants , " Andersen said . " We want to be a safe space or refuge for anybody who is vulnerable or targeted under this administration . " <p> Andersen said most of the congregations that sign up for the movement agree to offer support for individuals in sanctuary " providing security , preparing meals , distributing flyers or organizing prayer vigils . <p> Only 13 churches in the U.S. have housed individuals , including University Church in Hyde Park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , five are still pending in the courts , Andersen said , including the case of a Bolingbrook father of five who sought sanctuary at University Church in April . For most cases , invoking sanctuary is a public declaration . But some sanctuary seekers negotiate with authorities privately while residing within the walls of the church . <p> Leaders at Lake Street Church in Evanston said the congregation has elected to become a sanctuary church , but citing uncertainty about the political climate , declined to say whether anyone ever moved in . <p> " This is part of what we 're trying to figure out , " said Shanti Elliott , the church 's immigration justice leader . " The public nature is very important to sanctuary . On the other hand , a decision to declare sanctuary in solidarity with immigrants , who are very vulnerable and may be at risk , carries with that a commitment to protect them . " <p> While Roman Catholic parishes may choose to support a neighboring congregation , the Chicago Archdiocese discourages providing accommodations for individuals who are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our churches as sanctuaries because we do not want to create false hope among those seeking shelter that we can protect them from law enforcement actions , however unjust or inhumane we may view them to be , " archdiocese spokeswoman Colleen Tunney-Ryan said in an emailed statement . <p> Immigrant advocates also say sanctuary can be a lot like an indefinite house arrest . <p> " Thinking the solution for immigrants now is going to be sanctuary is not taking into consideration that they want to be living and want to be working and do n't want to be trapped in a church , " said Tania Unzueta , policy director for Mijente , an advocacy group that works with individuals facing deportation . <p> After invoking sanctuary in April , the Rev. Julian DeShazier , pastor of University Church , said he started spotting unmarked cars parked on the streets around the church . Volunteers accompany a person living inside the church 24 hours , seven days a week . <p> " It 's a security measure for him traveling from one room to the next , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to watch those who are watching him . " <p> That said , the protocol at University Church when there is someone in sanctuary is to not stand in the way if authorities show up and present the proper warrants . <p> " That becomes obstruction of justice , " he said . " We 're trying to obstruct what we believe is injustice . We want to follow the legal process and allow the opportunity to have due process in the same mode of resistance as civil rights or suffrage .

That study found that the lake bed was getting deeper by up to 4 inches annually in some areas in Illinois . <p> Experts like Tecic have some theories as to what the project might find . Waukegan Harbor has notoriously trapped sand over the years , requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the channel each year and dump much of the sediment south of the harbor . Tecic said preliminary evidence suggests there may be a large mound of sand due south of the harbor , resulting from a " dead zone , " an area without much wave action , or an abnormal current that is n't carrying the sand toward southern parts of the lakefront . <p> This research will also aim to explore another pressing issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer sand covering the lake bed , waves have carved into the primarily clay bed , a process that is irreversible .

However , snapshots of the information could be published sooner , Theuerkauf said . <p> Developed in Denmark in the early 1990s , the technology implemented in this scientific research has been used in Canada and Europe for mining projects . In November , the equipment was also used to survey Yellowstone National Park in an attempt to learn more about the park 's intricate underground waterways that provide the means for its renowned geysers and hot springs . <p> In the past , the Army Corps viewed sand as a nuisance when it built up along coastal infrastructure , dumping it far offshore .

In other communities , such as Waukegan , sands have clogged harbors , stalling boating commerce and carrying hefty price tags to remove sand each year . <p> " We need to work on understanding our coastline , " Tecic said . " We have really important recreational assets , natural habitats and economics along Lake Michigan . And all of that is threatened by the way the sand is moving .

@@13436633 @2036633/ <p> Illinois ' public school districts are roughly $20 billion in debt , a staggering figure fueled in part by decades of special deals in Springfield that have given districts exemptions so they can keep borrowing beyond limits set by law . <p> Today , that debt exceeds long-term school borrowing in most other states . It equates to about $10,000 for every Pre-K to 12th-grade public school student in Illinois , a Tribune investigation has found . <p> All the borrowing is a drain on taxpayers who have to repay the debt , as well as school budgets that must steer billions of dollars annually to principal and interest payments " money that could be targeted to classrooms . In some districts , more local tax money is collected for debt payments than for teacher salaries and student instruction . <p> Districts throughout the Chicago area took advantage of legislative maneuvers , as did several downstate districts given leeway to amass more debt , the Tribune found . <p> The Illinois State Board of Education tracks long-term debt as part of ratings on the financial health of districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to borrow . But if a district goes overboard on borrowing , there 's little to no oversight or action by the state , school officials told the Tribune . <p> " Nothing happens , " said Alicia Evans , chief school business official at south Cook 's Prairie-Hills Elementary School District 144 . She noted the state would typically step in if a district falters in several ways , not just in one area , such as debt . <p> District 144 had nearly $50 million in long-term debt last summer even though its limit was about $16 million . Last month , the district wrapped up another bond deal totaling nearly $20 million , documents show . <p> But in the murky world of debt limits , districts can use exemptions in the law or are allowed to borrow more because some types of bonds are not applied to the limit . Taxpayers are still on the hook for the full amount , whether the debt applies to the limit or not . <p> Issuing bonds is a typical method of long-term borrowing for school districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " working cash " that can help shore up district finances . The type of bond issues varies , with some , but not all , involving voter approval . <p> The law sets limits on how much districts can accumulate in long-term debt , based on districts ' property wealth and type . The limit is calculated by multiplying the value of taxable property in elementary school and high school districts by 6.9 percent , or 13.8 percent for K-12 unit districts . The borrowing limit will change as a district 's property values rise or fall . <p> But what seems like a straightforward formula has morphed over the years into myriad exemptions in the law " all approved by lawmakers and governors " giving dozens of districts leeway to borrow more than their debt limit . <p> A cadre of professionals , from bond lawyers to underwriters and financial advisers , gets a cut from bond deals to pay for their services . State education officials say " a bond broker or counselor would not let a district issue debt outside of their limitation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow to make ends meet , while Illinois has cut state aid payments to schools during the state 's budget crisis . Administrators noted that the borrowing , even with exemptions to the debt limit , is legal . <p> Help from lawmakers <p> Oswego Community Unit School District 308 at least twice received legislative help from then-House Republican Leader Tom Cross as the fast-growing district was trying to build more schools . <p> Cross was a chief sponsor of legislation that took effect in 2007 that allowed Oswego to issue up to a whopping $450 million in bonds without having that debt count against its borrowing limit . Four years earlier , Cross filed legislation that tweaked the borrowing-limit formula for Oswego to allow it to issue more bonds to finish $155 million in building projects . That was done by changing the multiplier of 13.8 percent to up to 20 percent , which expanded the district 's borrowing power . <p> Cross , now practicing law , recalled , " Oswego came to me and said , ' We are in this situation where our hands are tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( issue more bonds ) . We 're not going to have room for kids .

But when the housing bust occurred and the economy soured , things went downhill . <p> The 2007 legislation noted that Oswego was expected to exceed an enrollment of 27,000 by 2011-12 , but the projection was off by about 10,000 students . <p> The district never completed all the projects in the referendums and did n't issue all the bonds anticipated , spokesman Brian Graves said . Still the district " did take advantage of the legislation , " in that it did n't have to count certain debt against its borrowing limit . <p> The district still has about $394 million in long-term debt , according to the most recent annual financial report .

" <p> In that same 2007 legislation , Lincoln-Way High School District 210 got permission to issue bonds up to $225 million that would not be counted against its debt limit . At the time , the legislation stated Lincoln-Way was expected to exceed 8,400 students by the 2009-10 school year . That did n't materialize . Enrollment is at 7,028 this year . <p> Residents have criticized the district as it now prepares to close one of its high schools . <p> Superintendent Scott Tingley said those projections were made " before the economy and the housing bubble burst , " and that taxpayers approved the debt . Because of its high debt load and other factors , Lincoln-Way is now in the bottom category of financial health , called financial watch , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district revealed that it had deposited millions of bond dollars into the wrong account and spent money inappropriately .

Exemptions for several dozen districts are listed in the debt limitation law on the books , but not all districts are identified . And it is n't clear how many districts took advantage of broad exemptions that could apply to more than one district . <p> For example , Grayslake-based Community Consolidated School District 46 was able to increase its borrowing capacity because of an exemption for districts experiencing " rapidly increased enrollment , " according to bond documents .

The legislation " which turned out to be about Triad " tweaked the borrowing-limit formula so the district could borrow more . <p> The district 's high school was built in 1999 , with the help of the legislation .

The district has low property values , high tax rates and a large population of low-income children .

One distant family member was an alcoholic and difficult to live with . <p> Periodically the branch of the family in Mexico would grow weary and send him to Homan Avenue . Regular as clockwork , family members in Little Village would be exhausted by the burden and ship him back to Mexico .

His second job was with a mariachi band playing the taverns and restaurants that line 26th Street . <p> Hard workers or not , Bessie and her tenants would n't have gotten into this country had Trump 's Draconian immigration regulations been in place .

Bruce Rauner speaks to reporters in front of his office at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield , Ill. , after lawmakers passed a stopgap budget . <p> The stopgap budget agreement struck by Republican Gov . Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature is only adding to the state 's financial problems , according to a new report from Moody 's Investors Service , which estimated the state 's backlog of unpaid bills could reach a new high of $14 billion by next summer . <p> The main problem ? Illinois is spending more than it 's taking in following the rollback of a 2011 temporary income tax increase that 's resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Indeed , the stopgap agreement put off many tough decisions on cuts or tax hikes until after the November election , with much of state government spending essentially on autopilot in the meantime due to legislative action and various court orders . <p> Under the stopgap budget , expenses jumped 12 percent despite revenues remaining flat , according to Moody 's . The agency said it expects Illinois to get by as it has for years : by delaying payments and going further into the red . Without changes , Moody 's said Illinois could see a bill backlog of $14 billion by the time the new fiscal year starts in July , a figure that dwarfs the previous high of $10 billion under former Democratic Gov . Pat Quinn . <p> As the state struggles to make ends meet , Moody 's raised concerns about payments that are normally prioritized , such as debt payments . Doing so could further impact the state 's already worst-in-the-nation credit rating . <p> " Moody 's does not anticipate Illinois would suspend its statutory debt service requirements to continue funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , the state could resort to borrowing from debt service funds for operating needs . That or similar actions would signal a deterioration in Illinois ' credit position , " Moody 's spokesman David Jacobson said . <p> Asked about the report Wednesday , Rauner reiterated that the stopgap budget agreement was n't a balanced spending plan , but a " temporary way to get through the general election . " <p> His hope is that Democrats will be more willing to cut a deal on portions of his " turnaround agenda , " changes he has argued must come before he 'd agree to a comprehensive budget deal that 's likely to include both spending cuts and higher taxes . Democrats contend many of Rauner 's proposed changes , such as limiting payouts for workers hurt on the job or changes to what 's covered under collective bargaining , go against Democratic values and would undermine the middle class . <p> " We came up with some way to keep essential services functioning through the general election . That 's all this is , " Rauner said during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unpaid bill backlog is growing . It 's not growing as fast as it would if we did n't have the stopgap , but it 's still growing .

The selection committee raised concerns that the league 's lack of a championship game inevitably hurt its profile when it came to picking the best four teams . <p> " We thought we had teams that were good enough to get in last year and they did n't , " Bowlsby explained . " But the College Football Playoff committee has a hard job to do , and they did it . We were the ones to come out on the short end of the stick last year . <p> " I think more formulaically we need to think about whether we need a championship game . " <p> Bowlsby believes that the Big 12 is at " some disadvantage " by not having a title game . <p> " The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he said . <p> As a 10-member league , the Big 12 is unable to host a championship game per NCAA legislation which requires at least 12 teams . It 's the only conference among the Power 5 without a title game , but it 's been willing to live without one . <p> " We see it as a modest disadvantage , but there is also an advantage to not having to put your best teams against each other at the end of the year , " Bowlsby reiterated . <p> " So I think some years we 'll be very excited for not having a championship game and other years we 'll wish we had one more game to play so we can demonstrate what we can do for that 13th data point . " <p> Bowlsby said the conference athletic directors , presidents and chancellors continue to talk about it . <p> But the Big 12 did n't need a championship game this season because Oklahoma was selected for a national semifinal . <p> Nevertheless , the conference is looking at all options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a move that appeared a certainty until the Big Ten presented an amendment to block the alteration this fall . <p> Bowlsby said the Big 12 will try to have the Big Ten amendment defeated and then push through the proposal for deregulation . <p> " If we get it deregulated , we 'll take a look at a championship game and decide what we want to do , " Bowlsby said . <p> " Conferences ought to be able to determine how they finalize their champion . We just think it should be deregulated , and conferences should be able to decide how they chose their champion and let the committee decide which is the best path to the final group . " <p> If the amendment is n't overturned , Bowlsby said the conference will have to consider all options , including expansion , if it believes a championship game is a necessity to qualify for the national semifinals . <p> " Expansion is certainly an option if we find out that we ca n't have a championship game unless we have more members , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forced into having members just for the sake of having a championship game . " <p> After defections by Nebraska ( Big Ten ) , Colorado ( Pac-12 ) , Missouri ( SEC ) and Texas A&amp;M ( SEC ) , the Big 12 added West Virginia and TCU in 2012 . Options for expansion may have already passed the league by as Power 5 conferences began locking up members with grant-of-rights that guarantee massive financial payouts if a school chooses to leave . <p> Another speculated option includes adding schools such as UCF and USF , which provide attractive television markets and a growing fan base . But the Big 12 is n't in any hurry to make such a move that would have long-term repercussions to college football 's landscape . <p> " That 's why we believe in the deregulation and we 're going toward that path , " Bowlsby said . <p> The College Football Playoff took a major hit in its second season after television viewership dropped for the two semifinal games ( Orange , Cotton ) by nearly 40 percent from last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from last season 's 15.4 average for the Rose and Sugar bowls . <p> It 's safe to say that the Playoff 's decision to play games on New Year 's Eve rather than New Year 's Day as it did last season had a major impact on those numbers . In addition , both games were blowouts . <p> But the drop in viewers is n't just limited to the two semifinals . The New Year 's Six access bowls were down 13 percent in viewership from last season . It 's no secret that these games were n't close from a scoring standpoint , with the winners prevailing by an average margin of 24.2 points per game . Last season 's games were decided by 18.2 points per game . <p> " The College Football Playoff is a long-term multiplatform play for us , " said Burke Magnus , ESPN executive vice president of programming and scheduling . " With that said , there are many variables that impact ratings results , including what happens on the field , and the numbers this year were obviously impacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't expect a fix anytime soon . <p> Next season 's semifinals " the Peach and Fiesta bowls " also are scheduled to be played on New Year 's Eve . But that happens to be a Saturday , which would be a lot more attractive of an option for viewers than this year 's Thursday games . In 2017 , the semifinals revert back to the Rose and Sugars bowls , which are played on New Year 's Day . <p> But who really cares about TV numbers besides ESPN ? <p> The various conference commissioners are the ones who make up the Playoff management committee , and because they 're locked into a 12-year deal with the network , they 're already getting paid either way . And it 's because of the power conferences ' exclusive deals with bowl games like the Rose ( Big Ten and Pac-12 ) , Sugar ( SEC and Big 12 ) and Orange ( ACC ) that Playoff officials are n't willing to move the games to a permanent date . So it appears we 're stuck with the current setup until someone is willing to budge .
