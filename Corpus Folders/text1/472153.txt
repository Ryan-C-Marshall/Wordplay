Eyes do n't need a lot of diet control or heavy workouts . They 're actually pretty low-maintenance , generally . Simple upkeep every now and then ensures they 'll remain healthy year after year . <h> How Eyes Change With Age <p> Eyes start undergoing major changes in mid-life . Most of these are changes in the way the eye functions " for example , color perception changes , shrinking field of vision , and the like .

Diet also has a significant influence on the health of your eyes . <h> Food For Whiter Eyes <p> Nutrition is very important when it comes to eyes . The five nutrient categories that you must include in your regular diet for healthier eyes are : <p> Vitamin A - Remember how your mother insisted that you finish your carrots ? Well she had a reason and she was right . Fruits and vegetables high in Vitamin A or beta carotene are a must food for your eyes . Fill up your fridge with carrots , peaches , papaya and mangoes . <p> Vitamin E - Vitamin E can be provided to the body by regular intake of sunflower seeds , wheat germ , hazelnut , peanut butter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide half of your daily dose of Vitamin E. <p> Antioxidants - Leafy greens are good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin , antioxidants responsible for lowering risks of developing macular degeneration and cataracts .

@@62450405 @2450405/ <h> Facial Brushing <p> Facial Brushing <h> IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE BEAUTY PUZZLE ! <p> The first layer of the skin , the one you see , is called the epidermis . The epidermis is composed of several layers of cells ; the outermost of them is made of dead skin cells called the horny layer . These flat , horny cells are about 80 percent protein and only 20 percent water . The skin sheds more than a million cells every hour . Over a period of every twenty-five to thirty days , your skin renews itself by sloughing off its outermost layer . <p> Experiments with human cell cultures show normal cells stop dividing when they touch their neighbors. - Consequently , to speed up the process of the reproduction of new cells , dead cells must be removed . That is why daily exfoliation can make a world of difference . <p> Exfoliation is the most important part of a beauty regimen . We speed up the process of skin rejuvenation when we remove dead skin cells . Exfoliation energizes your face and improves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking complexion . <p> A brush is also the most cost effective way to rejuvenate your skin . However , all of the facial brushes I tried were too soft . The softness makes sense when you consider that most people who eat cooked food generally have more sensitive skin . However , on raw foods , your skin will become supple and less easily irritated . <p> Most people who are attentive to their skin care do a dry body scrub ( and I now offer a Body Brush in my online store ) but not many perform dry facial brushing . Gentle manual facial brushing will speed up cell turnover , maximize oxygen intake , strengthen the skin 's inner structure , and eventually reverse some of the effects of aging . The trick is to use a good nurturing and healing cream to accelerate the skin recovery time and to allow you to use the brush daily . <p> Body brushing and face brushing are essential components of a health and beauty regimen , and should be done daily . Though body brushing is not a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beauty industry that brushing one 's face is not necessary , and perhaps is not even beneficial . <p> I believe that face brushing is just as important as body brushing . Dead skin cells accumulate on the face as they do on the body . Some will slough off naturally , but only brushing can truly refresh and invigorate the face . <p> Many anti-wrinkle creams contain some form of retinol ( for instance , in the form of retinyl palmitate ) . Retinyl palmitate , or vitamin A palmitate , is a common vitamin supplement , with the formula C36H60O2 . We consume a healthy quantity of this vitamin through our daily fresh fruit and vegetable consumption . It works better from the inside . <p> Anti-aging creams usually contain alpha hydroxyl acid . This chemical exfoliates , or to put it another way , peels off a layer of your skin , giving it a softer look . A simple fruit mask will do the same thing since alpha hydroxyl cells are derived from fruit . The effect that you are seeking is exfoliation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better results in a more natural way . <p> So important is the face brushing that I have decided to offer a FREE brush to everyone who buys two jars of my Anti-Aging Facial Cream . <h> Directions : How to use the brush <p> First wash your face , dry with a towel , and then proceed with the facial dry brushing . When facial brushing , use a gentle , upward movement . Smooth , upward gliding strokes lift the muscles of the face instead of dragging them down . We do n't need to give gravity any extra help ! <p> Your facial brushing strokes should move up the neck and along the contour of the face . Make several gentle circling movements counter-clockwise on the right cheek and clockwise on the left always moving along the cheek muscles . Be careful never to stretch the skin . Sweep the forehead gently from the center to each temple . <p> The first couple of months be extra gentle ! The sensation should be pleasantly stimulating . Stop immediately if it does n't feel good and increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have sensitive skin and/or are over 50 and this is your first time performing facial brushing , be extra GENTLE when you begin facial brushing . Do not press down hard with the bristles at all . In a couple of months , your skin will adjust and you can be more vigorous. *** <p> At first , the whole procedure should not last more than 30 seconds . Gradually increase the time to one , two and finally , three minutes . <p> After the completing the facial brushing , apply facial cream immediately and massage the face and neck areas in small symmetrical circles . <p> Note : Occasionally you need to clean your facial brush . The best way is to rub some cornmeal into the brush for a few seconds , let it sit and then scrub it out with your fingers or by vigorously brushing a clean rag . The cornmeal will absorb dust and oil from the brush and whisk it away to keep your brush it tip top shape . Do not use water and soap as this will shorten the lifespan of the brush . 196868 @qwx606868

They 'll shave their heads and let their hair grow gray again from the get-go . No coloring . No wig . I know women who possess the jam to do this " but darn few . This is likely a solution for only one percent of women out there , at best . <p> 2 . A more standard , less daring way to go : Cut your hair short . Many women our age do n't wear long hair anyway , so this wo n't be too drastic . The basic idea : The time to wait for your gray hair to grow in and replace the colored hair would n't be long . If you 're not used to short hair , this could be a chance to try a new , sassy style . If you get squeamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie you over until it grows long again. - <p> 3 . Wig , but no shaving . You just cover your head temporarily while the color-to-gray transition goes on underneath . <p> 4 . A common oneSilver and platinum highlights while you transition . Just match the color of those highlights to the color of the roots . If you do go this route , have your stylist place a few of those highlights around your face . They 'll stand out , allowing you to let some gray gradually shine through . Add more highlights at random as you allow the rest of your gray to show. - The trouble : You 're damaging your hair . You 'll have to condition- it every day " lavishly . <p> 5 . Use a semi-permanent dye . It will wash out in a month or so . Eventually , after a few applications , your will be able to fade fairly quickly into the fuller gray that 's developed underneath .

You want to make your transition fast ? You can . But at a price . Stripper is the regrettable generic name for this product . It cleans out all your artificial color all at once . Wham ! This method reminds me of stripping paint , chemically , from furniture . You can only imagin the state of your hair after that procedure . <p> 7 . Once enough gray shows , start using shampoo especially made for gray hair . When hair goes gray , it can tend to look dull or take on an odd color tint . You may have seen a yellow-ochre tinge on some ladies ' graying locks . And swimmers going gray will often pick up a vaguely greenish tint . A specially formulated clarifying shampoo will keep your gray hair color looking clean and glossy . Glossers and topical shiners can also make your gray hair look shiny and luminescent . <p> There 's some merit to every one of these ideas . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get creative and keep you posted every step of the way . <p> In the meantime , I am keeping my hair revitalized with the help of my Scalp Tonic with with Cayenne Pepper and Mustard Greens Extracts .

@@62450454 @2450454/ <h> B-12 Controversy <p> B-12 Controversy <p> Let 's take a look at the vitamin B-12 controversy . <h> What is B12 ? <p> The term vitamin B-12 is a generic for a group of compounds known as cobalamins . There are three forms of B12 " cyanocobalamin , methylcobalamin , and hydroxycobalamin " found naturally , most often in healthy soils . <p> Among the most important functions of B12 in the body is that methylcobalamins are necessary to keep homocysteine levels in balance . When these levels become too high , this can be toxic to nerves and blood vessels . Some of the first symptoms of a B-12 deficiency are neurological such as depression , memory loss , tingling in hands and feet , paranoia , even diarrhea and inflamed mucous membranes . Since cobalamins are related structurally to hemoglobin , a B-12 deficiency can also cause certain types of anemia . <h> What Causes B12 Deficiency ? <p> A low dietary intake of B-12 " simply not consuming enough " can be a cause of deficiency . But often the culprit is poor absorption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small intestine may be blocked by putrefaction from an unhealthy or high-protein diet . <p> A person on a standard diet stores about 2000 to 3000 mg of vitamin B-12 a day in the liver and muscles . Our bodies secrete about 2 mg of B-12 a day through the bile into the small intestine . From there , about half is reabsorbed by the body . <h> The Appendix : Then and Now <p> That , at least , is the conventional view . There is , however , a different opinion . Dr. Brian Clement , a raw food promoter , studied anatomical diagrams of human intestines , going back as far as 300 years . He discovered some startling facts . Many people were eating a natural , organic and largely plant-based diet through much of this time . The ascending colon was shown to protrude inward in the shape of a boot where it went down near the ileocecal valve . This little boot-shaped pocket was where the digested food , with all its B-12 intact , actually cultured and recreated itself . <p> Somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic change . Now , where the little boot-shaped pocket had been , the ascending colon went straight up and down , with nothing but a little , shriveled-up piece labeled the appendix . ' The appendix ' had actually once been a vital part of the digestive and lymph systems . As part of the lymph system , it helped filter out toxins . As part of the digestive system , its secondary function was to secrete a lubricant to assist with moving food along the digestive tract . <p> No one knows why this change in structure happened , but it apparently began from about the year 1700 onwards . According to this theory the body no longer had the means to culture its own source of Vitamin B12 , and consequently it is now necessary to either supplement or assure in some other way that a source of B12 is always present and being absorbed by the body . <p> Even though some raw foodists seem to stay healthy on the raw vegan diet without B12 supplementation , they key is that it is only some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you get well educated . <h> What 's the Solution ? <p> One solution is B-12 supplementation . But it 's not without a risk either . One man I know was supplementing with Vitamin B-12 because , after all , it 's a good idea to prevent deficiencies " right ? But this man began to experience burning and tingling in his hands and feet , as well as itching skin . A brief internet search for something completely unrelated happened to give him the answer : He was overdosing on Vitamin B-12 . When he stopped supplementing , his symptoms vanished . <p> B-12 supplements are certainly not the answer for everyone . There are other ways . I 've encountered several raw food aficionados who have managed to cure themselves of certain deficiencies and gain needed weight by incorporating raw eggs into their diets . Raw eggs bring many of the nutrients that some raw vegans seem to have hard time absorbing from raw produce . <p> - <h> 100 Days to 100% Raw <p> A Step by Step Guide <h> Consider Raw Eggs <p> Eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if eaten only occasionally . Here 's an option for people opposed to supplementation " just eat a raw egg every other day to be sure you 're getting your B-12 . In this way , you can stay 100% raw and avoid any packaged supplements . But of course , if being 100% vegan is critical for you , this will not be an appropriate choice . <p> But are n't raw eggs yucky ? Nonsense . The idea 's already familiar , even in conventional culture . Folks of middle age or better may recall that , at the Orange Julius stands once popular in malls , adding a raw egg to your orange juice was a popular option , offered right up there on the menu . And the traditional holiday treat , Egg Nog uses raw egg . Try what I do in the winter months when seasonal fruit is not as abundant : add a raw egg to your smoothie " you 'll find it adds no objectionable taste , and indeed adds a pleasant creaminess . <p> What should you do about vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody . One thing 's for certain , though : Better safe than sorry . <p> Now , some people just say no to eggs . For some of these , this principle is just a corollary to being strictly vegan . But note : A vitamin B-12 deficiency is a pretty darn serious prospect . I urge : Put aside arbitrary convictions . Choose health . If B12 supplements do n't work for you , do n't risk your health . - Stay open to the practice of raw eggs , for the very sake of making 100% raw totally safe. - Read- Raw Food and Hot Yoga- for more information on B-12. - 196867 @qwx606867

It seems oily skin needs one thing and dry skin needs another . We are led to believe that tightening the skin may require laser therapy or even cosmetic surgery . There are appliances to buy , lotions to apply and pills to take . <p> That always makes me wonder - is there a single solution that can take care of all my skin issues together ? <p> Luckily , there is . Dry brushing is the one-stop solution that gives skin a spa-like treatment within minutes . This technique is effective , time-tested and is so quick that it can be easily incorporated into our daily routine . Too simple to believe ? Well , take a look at some of the benefits of dry skin brushing . <p> Benefits of Dry Brushing <p> 1. - - - - Exfoliates <p> The most basic benefit of skin brushing is that is exfoliates the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to the everyday wear and tear , these pores get filled with dead skin cells , dust and many other miniscule foreign particles . <p> Dry brushing gently brooms our skin pores removing such particles and clearing clogged pores . It is a great exfoliation technique and the best thing you can do to help your skin breathe . <p> 2. - - - - Helps the Excretory System <p> The skin is the largest organ in our body and acts as a barrier which protects all our other organs . You may be surprised to learn that your skin is responsible for sloughing off of 1-2 pounds of waste each day . Among other things , these waste materials include dead cells , sweat , toxins and excess minerals . Dead skin cells are actually good for our body in a certain sense , for as soon as these dead skin cells are discarded , new epidermal cells take their place keeping the skin looking youthful and fresh . Though our body 's excretory system does its best to remove these skin cells , often its efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and if your lifestyle is one that allows many toxins to come in . That 's where dry brushing comes in , - facilitating the body 's excretory system in clearing the path for new cells to come in . <p> 3. - - - - Stimulates the Lymphatic System <p> The lymphatic system 's task is getting rid of all the cellular waste in our body . However , if the body produces an excess of cellular waste ( often due to dietary and environmental effects ) , - such buildup of toxins and waste over time can cause the lymphatic system to choke and in turn we get sick . Dry brushing regularly is one of the most efficient ways to stimulate your lymphatic system and thus help it to eliminate waste effectively. - <p> Finnish nutritionist and naturopathic physician Paavo Airola used dry brushing as a treatment for patients suffering from ailments such as diabetes and heart disease . He noted visible improvements in their conditions as a result of more efficient elimination of toxins from their bodies . <p> 4. - - - - Reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumpy stubborn fat that puckers up skin and just wo n't go away . Though cellulite in itself is not harmful , it looks unsightly and keeps becoming more prevalent with age . But it does n't have to be this way ! <p> When we dry brush , we apply gentle pressure on cellulite as well . When done regularly , this pressure starts softening the adamant cellulite . Over time , dry brushing shows impressive results in evenly distributing these fat deposits and hence fading the appearance of cellulite . <p> 5. - - - - Smoothes Dry Skin Areas <p> The skin on our knees , elbows and heels remains the driest largely due to poor blood circulation and exfoliation in those areas , and thus hardens and gets rough . Dry brushing these particular areas will get rid of those dry dead cells and stimulates a rush of new healing invigorating blood to arrive . The result ?

Some of the most obvious effects are a sore neck and stiff shoulders , but there are also consequences for your body 's circulatory system . <p> When you dry brush , you will be reaching even the most unused body parts , which will help in improving blood flow in the body and promote better discharge of metabolic wastes as well as boosting your cell renewal capability . <p> 8. - - - - Invigorates the Nervous System <p> Dry brushing lightly massages the entire body which reduces muscular tension and relieves stress .

Dry brushing regularly every morning can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your day . <p> Women all over the world spend hundreds of dollars on getting massages at a spa , getting liposuction and other surgeries done on their bodies and visiting salons regularly for innumerable skin care treatments . <p> But just a couple of minutes of everyday skin brushing can give you similar yet long-lasting results . That too without any hassle and without costing you a fortune . <p> All you need to begin dry brushing is a body brush like this . Just before hitting the shower , when your body is still dry , brush your body with strokes aiming towards your heart . After completing the body brushing session , take a shower and moisturize your body well with natural oil . Within a couple of weeks , you will begin to notice its effects - your skin will start becoming more radiant , and you may even feel more energy .

@@62450478 @2450478/ <h> Solutions for Stretch Marks <p> Solutions for Stretch Marks <p> One issue keeps coming up that many readers write me about , especially those who have shed a lot of extra pounds by going raw : stretch marks ! <h> What Causes Stretch Marks ? <p> Stretch marks , called striae , have their cause in rapid stretching of the skin , especially when the skin is not hydrated enough to withstand it . Avoiding rapid weight gain or loss is of utmost importance in their prevention . Striae most often look like shiny red or purple bands or stripes that become glossy , whitish , and resemble scar tissue . They might also be slightly depressed in relation to surrounding skin . <p> There are two theories as to exactly why striae develop . One is that the skin stretches so fast it tears , forming scar tissue . The other theory is that increased levels of cortisol ( a stress hormone ) prevent connective tissue from forming , weakening the dermal layer , which then tears . <p> The second layer of your skin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structural protein making up about 75 percent of our skin . Striae actually begin with the stretching and breakdown of collagen , causing interference in the natural order of the collagen fibers . <p> More practically , striae appear when someone loses weight quickly , or during pregnancy , or in the presence of some medical conditions such as Cushing disease , diabetes , or when someone has used cortisone compounds for long periods of time . As those of us who are mothers will not find surprising , pregnancy is the number one precursor to stretch marks , followed by rapid weight loss . <h> Dietary Aids <p> If you are noticing stretch marks , you will want to ensure adequate collagen synthesis in your body by consuming foods rich in Vitamin C. Among its many other benefits , Vitamin C is a major player in collagen production . Fortunately , there are so many raw foods that are rich in Vitamin C that our job is easy . For vegetable sources , try collard greens , kale , and red peppers to start with . Add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grapefruit and lemon are chock full of Vitamin C. The body does n't store Vitamin C , so you must consume it daily . Eating a good hydrating raw food diet , rich in Vitamin C , is your first line of defense against stretch marks . <h> Some Beauty Devices Can Help <p> Exfoliation is your next best friend . Stretch marks will respond quite well to consistent dry skin brushing . Out with the old , in with the new ! Collagen production is stimulated by removing dead cells on the skin 's surface to encourage new cell production . You want to slough off the old , deformed collagen and allow new , healthy cells to take their place . <h> Facial Brush <p> for glowing complexion <p> RejuvaRoll is an invaluable aid to your skin 's natural healing process . Using it not only helps promote the breakdown of scar tissue , but the gentle action of the pins helps stimulate circulation and the production of new , healthier skin cells , filling in stretch marks and restoring elasticity . <h> RejuvaRoll <p> healing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a practice that gives a strong enhancement of capillary blood flow which is especially important in those areas of your skin experiencing stagnant blood flow - scar tissue and stretch marks . <h> Body Sculpting Cups <p> for natural skin tighteninng <h> Additional Helpful Practices <p> Even with dietary changes and effective massaging and exfoliation improvement will take time , but it will happen . In the meantime , some people have had success in reducing the appearance of striae by massaging regular 3% hydrogen peroxide into them daily . <p> Avoid overexposure to the sun . Even though you want to gently sunbathe every day to get sufficient natural Vitamin D , you will want to avoid the sun during the hottest hours of the day , as this will only serve to further break down and damage new skin cells . Be responsible with your daily sunbathing " overexposure will do nothing but defeat your purpose . <h> Prevent Future Stretch Marks <p> While you work on minimizing our current stretch marks , you will want to make sure you are preventing future ones . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improving your circulation as well as flooding your body with all the needed nutrients and vitamins to help your skin renew itself with healthy cells . <p> A regular exercise routine , especially one that includes regular stretching - such as hot yoga - will actually prevent stretch marks for it will allow your skin to stay supple as well as keeping your capillaries healthy and strong . Having a regular exercise routine will also help keep your weight in a healthy and steady range , for rapid weight fluctuations is a major cause of stretch marks . When it comes to pregnancy , when rapid stretching of the skin fibers can hardly be prevented , many women report that keeping the stomach moisturized can minimize stretch marks , with cocoa butter being the most popular moisturizer . <h> Be Patient <p> As with most things , remember to be patient . Give your body time to make the improvements you are striving for . If it is too late for you to avoid stretch marks by practicing prevention , you can , with time , drastically minimize them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy skin from within with a hydrating raw food diet . Second , exfoliate to she 'd the old layers of less than healthy tissue . If you feel the need , apply a little pure coconut oil after your skin care regimen to keep your new healthy skin supple and glowing . 196867 @qwx606867

And they made out more than okay . Here are 5 advantages you may not have known about which may " indeed should " get you racked out on the floor tonight . <p> 1 . No more lower back pain ! <p> An entire medical-pharmaceutical industry has built up around back pain alone . Flat back-sleeping on a firm surface may take your lower back pain away . <p> 2 . Your body gets a stretch while you sleep . <p> Your whole body will benefit. - Mattresses actually play havoc with the body 's natural alignment , causing the hips to sink in and the lower back to collapse , much like sitting in a chair , where the body becomes tight and hunched . This is sometimes referred to as ' front loading ' . This , in turn , also interferes with the capacity of the lungs and you can not breath deeply . <p> When the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stresses the body at a time when it should be most relaxed . A soft mattress only feels comfortable because it allows the body to stay in the tight , hunched or ' front loaded ' position whereas it should actually be straightening and lengthening the skeletal system during sleep . ( Where did the expression ' sleep tight ' ever come from , anyway ? ) <p> 3 . Your hips and shoulders will get aligned . <p> A straight wooden floor can realign your hips and shoulders into more natural , more symmetrical positions . Sore hips , sore shoulders , and pinched nerves can often be attributed to awkward mattress sleeping . Imbalanced muscles , poor posture , and misaligned bones can trap and pinch nerves . Misaligned shoulders can strain your neck and back , causing chronic pain , even headaches. - <h> RejuvaPad- for Youthful Eyes <p> When I speak of sleeping on a hard surface , I am not referring to a ' firm ' mattress or suggest you put a board under a sagging one .

I have succeeded in training myself to do this , and so can you ! <p> 4 . Beautiful posture <p> Correct posture is very important because during sleep growth hormone is produced in the pituitary gland and distributed throughout the body . One of its functions is to thicken and lengthen the bones . So sleeping on a hard surface will align the spine and help the growth hormone travel through the body unimpeded . <p> Sleeping on a hard surface provides just the right amount of resistance we need for proper alignment , optimal breathing and healthy circulation. - Sleeping on a solid surface will keep your body 's musculo-skeletal system in good tune 24-seven . Sleep on your back on a nice wooden floor , and you 'll look good , walk better than you ever have before. - <p> 5 . Tranquility . <p> Sleeping on the wooden floor brings a sense of repose .

@@62450522 @2450522/ <h> Breast Enhancement : The Natural Solution <p> Breast Enhancement : The Natural Solution <p> When you begin the transition to the raw foods lifestyle , and you start to lose weight , this will affect your breasts . Can you really increase your breast size ? Can you firm and tone your breasts ? In my experience , if you follow the raw food lifestyle , your breasts do firm up and become more youthful , just as the rest of your body . But it might take a couple of years . It would be nice if something could be done to speed up this process . <p> Of course many women who are seeking bust enhancement opt to go under the knife of the plastic surgeon . Besides the risks the doctor will tell you about , such as surgery complications , implant rejection , ruptured implants , loss of sensation et al , it bears repeating that any surgery and the related anesthesia is always going to expedite your aging process . And of course , eventually you have to go for replacement implants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind that what breast enhancing creams and supplements do , is cause breasts to swell temporarily by causing you to retain more water . The use of such products can interfere with your body 's metabolism . <h> Consider Breast Massage <p> The safest of all available methods would be a breast massage . Breast massage for wellness is not widely known in western culture . On the other hand , breast massage techniques are widely accepted and used in health and beauty salons in Asia . Countries like Thailand place great importance on the therapeutic value of the breast massage , a quite effective form of breast enhancement . Here are some simple techniques for self-breast massage ... <p> Perform a breast massage 1 to 3 times a week , each time for about 2 to 5 minutes . Begin by using your fingers moving the skin away ( outward ) from the nipple slowly and gently . This process can help start the flow of toxins and fluids out of your breasts . Any more pressure than that can actually stop the flow . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to gently but firmly massage and not use any harsh slapping ' technique . <h> Try with Oil <p> You can apply some massage oil you buy at a health salon or health food store . Sweet almond and apricot kernel oils are excellent . If you 're allergic to nuts , use light coconut oil and avoid the almond oil . You can also use my Beautiful on Raw " GLOW " Cream . It will be absorbed very quickly and will not soil your clothes , at the same time giving your skin a smooth and soft feel . Use very light pressure when massaging the breasts . You 'll need only the lightest movement , using the palms or flat part of the fingertips . Gently knead the breasts with your hands using a lifting and pressing action . <p> According to Ayurvedic practices , massages will help lift the breasts , prevent sagging , and increase breast size . The steps just described tend to loosen up breast muscles and improve circulation . This next step will help facilitate the process . Use your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clockwise and reverse clockwise motion . <p> Do n't twist too much . But the twisting action will create a slight tourniquet effect and help fresh blood and fluids to flow in and toxins to flow out from the breast area . When you can , avoid wearing a bra at home " and always when you 're sleeping . Wearing a bra can restrict lymph flow and the release of toxins . This is a very natural way to enhance the breasts without surgery . Regular breast massage will promote better skin , better muscle structure , good tissue growth and good breast tone . <h> Sea-Buckthorn Oil <p> for beautiful skin <h> What about Herbal Breast Enlargement ? <p> Some women who practice breast massage to increase breast fullness also use various herbs to help expand , firm and tone their breasts . Herbal breast enlargement , combined with breast massage , tends to reverse sagging , out of shape breasts . A note of caution : Be sure , to research these herbs yourself before applying them to your beasts . <p> Saw Palmetto is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and seems to have no side effects or drug interactions ( though of course do not use more than the recommended dosage ) . The breast enhancing effects are from phyto-nutrients that tend to stimulate the breast tissue , increase size and improve general breast health . Saw Palmetto oil can be used while performing breast massage . <p> Two other herbs widely used for breast enhancement are wild yam and fennel . Wild yam has been used for a long time and is known for its benefits in women 's reproductive health ( including menopausal and menstrual problems ) . You can add wild yam powder to a moisturizer to use in massaging your breasts . Fennel is another herb used for centuries to enhance breast size and even promote milk production in new mothers . It is rich in phytonutrients which stimulate breast size increase . Fennel essential oil can be added to a good moisturizer while performing a breast massage . <p> Onions ?

@@62450541 @2450541/ <h> Parasite Treatment <p> Parasite Treatment <p> The very word parasite strikes horror in the heart of any determined health seeker , bringing a shudder at the thought of your body entertaining these beasties . And how , exactly , do you go about dealing with this issue ? <h> What are parasites ? <p> Parasites are organisms which live upon a host . But we 're not talking about what 's called a symbiotic relationship , in which a living thing lives off the host and provides a benefit in return . This is rarely the case with parasites . <p> It is estimated that currently in the West at least one out of every six people has parasites of some sort . Parasites are so prevalent that it 's surprising the subject is not more openly addressed in North American culture , as it is in other countries . <h> What kinds of parasites are there ? <p> There are countless types of parasites , ranging from single-celled protozoa to actual worms which can grow to several feet in length . Some of the more well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some time come into contact with pinworms , hookworms , roundworms and tapeworms , just to name a few . <h> How do we get parasites ? <p> We can get them by travelling abroad , by playing with pets which have them , by walking barefoot , by drinking contaminated water , from contact with raw meat , even from swimming in the ocean . <p> Contact with parasites is frequent . I promise you that you 've touched a bunch of them today . But how do they take hold inside of us ? For the most part , parasites enter and take up residence in unhealthy human bodies . They feed , for example , on excess constipated food in the gut . They 're especially fond of the remains of cooked starchy food and decaying animal products . However , there are reports that even raw foodists may be at risk . <h> Symptoms of parasites <p> Symptoms are often overlooked . Parasites mimic symptoms of other disorders , presenting in the form of nausea , skin rashes , diarrhea , abdominal pain , headaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weight gain , fatigue and night sweats . Take a list of these complaints to your doctor , and chances are that testing you for parasites will not be the first order of business . Common as these symptoms are , keep in mind that an absence of symptoms does not mean you are parasite-free . <h> Testing <p> Testing for parasites is usually only available through your health care provider , though determined individuals might be able to locate independent labs to conduct their own testing . A test from a health care professional will usually start with a stool sample or a blood test , or both , depending on your symptoms , your history and your current concerns . <h> Parasite Cleansing <p> There are numerous parasite cleanses available on the internet . Many of these are quite involved , requiring strict protocols and the purchase of specific herbs and oils . As big a believer as I am in cleansing generally , I have never cleansed for parasites in particular . Thus I ca n't speak with any authority on parasite cleanses ' available online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark , a leading authority on parasites , offers an Herbal Parasite Cleanse , and there are other parasite cleanses popular in the raw food movement , such as Ejuva . <p> Besides parasite cleansing protocols , there are other methods that have stood the test of time and have been used successfully in other countries for years . <h> Home Remedies for Parasites <p> One world-renowned remedy for intestinal parasites is Black Walnut Hull , which you can buy at reputable brick-and-mortar or online health food vendors . <p> Oil of Oregano is very effective for some people.It 's advised to take oil of oregano in tablet form for six weeks . One study showed growth inhibition for at least ten different microbes , including Candida albicans ( yeast ) . Other anti-parasitic oils include flax oil , pumpkin seed oil , and watermelon oil . <p> There are teas with anti-parasitic herbs such as ginger , horseradish , chili pepper , flax with stevia , and others . Pomegranate juice daily will kill tapeworms . A quarter cup of finely ground pumpkin seeds can eliminate many other varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean <p> Colon hydrotherapy is essential in cleansing the entire colon of waste and toxic debris that harbor parasites of all kinds . If you 're embarking on a parasite cleanse , you 'll definitely want to schedule some sessions with a trained colon hydrotherapist . <p> It 's also recommended to exclude honey and dried fruit from your diet when treating for parasites . <p> On a raw diet you have a better chance of keeping a clean , alkaline bloodstream and a healthier intestinal terrain to discourage parasites from sticking around . The name of the game : If you want to get rid of and stay rid of parasites , become a poor host !

It 's also great for your posture .

This leads to a buildup of fluid and toxins . Connective tissue forms hard , fibrous capsules around your fat cells , which creates that dimpled " cottage cheese " appearance on the skin 's surface around your thighs , buttocks and sometimes lower abdomen . Cellulite seems to happen to anyone - including otherwise healthy women . <p> The skin is made up of three distinct skin layers : epidermis , dermis , and subcutaneous fat . The outermost skin layer is your epidermis . Immediately under is the dermis , saturated with hair follicles , sweat glands , blood vessels , nerve receptors and connective tissue . The next deeper layer of tissue is the first of three sub-layers of subcutaneous fat . This uppermost sub-layer of subcutaneous fat consists of " standing fat-cell chambers " separated by connective tissue . From these fat-cell chambers , fat cells protrude into the dermis . This unevenness and irregularity of dermis , created by distortions of subcutaneous fat , gives skin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elastic fibers allows more fat cells to protrude into the dermis area , worsening the appearance of cellulite . <p> If cellulite is your main concern , I have recently introduced a brand new product : the Venus Body Sculpting Cups which I have found to be the most effective at keeping cellulite at bay . <h> Belt of Pins : How it works <p> The Belt of Pins uses two types of needles - copper and iron . Some of the iron needles are plated with nickel or zinc . Some copper needles are plated in silver . As a result , five different metals come into contact with your skin . Blood is among the most important fluids in the human body . Metals in micro-doses are part of your blood 's makeup . Microelements - including these metals - are vital for our well being . The beneficial effect of the " Rolling Bed " begins when the tips of the Rolling Bed 's needles are differently charged , producing galvanic current at the contact points on the skin . <p> NOTE : Some people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel , it is best not to purchase the Belt of Pins . <p> The pins on the belt are about 2 millimeters high . The thickness of the epidermis and the dermis varies but is around 2mm over most of the body . The dermis is made up of blood vessels , nerve endings , and connective tissue . The Dermis composed of cells that do n't divide regularly . They can divide but they do so when called upon to do so , such as when they need to close a wound . The pins ' gentle pressure on the skin reaches through the epidermis and dermis , reaching down all the way to subcutaneous fat - all without actually puncturing the skin ! <h> Using Belt of Pins <p> Using your Belt of Pins will increase blood flow and lymph drainage in applied areas , aiding the removal of fluids and toxins .

You want to remove some fat , so you are pressing on it , not cutting . The pins will leave an imprint on your skin in the form of small red dots , just as any object will do when pressed to the skin . This is nothing to be concerned about . Wait a little until they disappear and use your Belt of Pins again . <p> The pins provide a deep massaging effect that loosens up connective tissues and fatty deposits as well as stimulates your circulation to absorb that fatty tissue . <p> You can use your belt for double chins , love handles and any other area where your body pockets fat . There 's no medication involved - here 's a completely natural alternative to liposuction , mesotherapy and other invasive cosmetic procedures . You 'll find no better spot-targeting products to work on fat . <p> I 've also discovered I can wear the Belt of Pins around my head to stimulate hair growth .

Even though we do n't know the exact mechanism of what is happening , you will know something is being released into the blood stream . As you experience a gradual marked imp rovement in you skin , you will know that it was toxins , excess fat deposits and retained water being released . <p> Because the Belt of Pins is not in the least invasive , you can and should use it daily for dramatic results .

The consequence : reduced density and dimension in that bone . <p> The lower jaw bone " the mandible " supports the lower face . Reduced bone density in the mandible as we age leads to a shrinking lower jaw with reduced , shallower angles . The chin diminishes . Facial features become less defined .

To illustrate this we have to understand how the human body builds bone mass . Bones are piezoelectric : they give off an electric current when they are mechanically stressed . In other words , if you take a bone , and apply pressure to it , it will actually produce an electric charge . In your body , this electric charge attracts a matrix of minerals to the location that 's being stressed where they add to the bone mass density and essentially build bigger and stronger bones .

This buffering capacity increases with the flow of saliva . The more you chew thoroughly , the greater the salivary flow rate . Saliva is also supersaturated with calcium and phosphorus , which inhibits demineralization of tooth structure . <p> If no pressure is applied to the bone it will be re-absorbed so that the priceless calcium can be deposited elsewhere . The jawbone begins to dissolve , resulting in concave surfaces , causing that " sunken mouth " look . This sunken appearance to the lower face makes us look older than we actually are . Bone loss also contributes to deep wrinkling , a pointed chin and jowls , and reduction in biting strength . It could be concluded that the lack of hard chewing because of missing teeth , crowns or other dental work adversely affects the growth and development of the jaw . <p> Only the jawbone that has chewed often and hard will retain its shape and form .

After having my son around 4 months he developed a rash even when I was using the " all natural " baby wash . One night I decided to use this facial cleanser on his sensitive skin and it immediately looked better ! It cleared shortly after switching to just using this at bath time : - ) it not only is extremely gentle , but also has healing ingredients that I 've always appreciated on my own skin but I 'm so pleased I can now use it on my little boy !

And now , some fine lines that crinkle like crows ' feet whenever I laugh or smile . It 's hard to conceal them using makeup , since I have uneven skin tone and it all looks fake . This makes it very hard for me to look attractive . It hurts , and some days I dare not look at myself in the mirror . <h> What Causes those Dark Circles ? <p> Dark or gray circles under the eyes can also result from allergies , dehydration , Vitamin B12 or K deficiencies , anemia . Sometimes the fat cells that create the padding under our eyes diminish as we age or after we lose weight , lending a dark , hollow look to the under-eye area as blood vessels become more visible. - As you can see there are many causes for this condition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Poor Circulation , Carbon Deposits <p> If circulation is poor , blood vessels and weakened capillaries show up more easily in the eye area . This too tends to give a purplish discoloration " which is actually a form of bruising . Dark circles are sometimes actually carbon deposits , resulting from the body 's inability to digest protein completely " often the consequence of a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. - <p> There are some causes and aggravating factors which are hard or almost impossible to treat , even hard to identify or distinguish . People with darker complexions sometimes have even more problems with dark circles , due to the extra melanin in their skin . Heredity plays a role . Sometimes , as is often the case in the nutritional and medical sciences , we simply ca n't identify a cause at all. - But let 's not get overwhelmed and discouraged ! Generally speaking , swollen blood vessels are the culprit. - <h> RejuvaCup <p> The Best Way to Cleanse Your Skin and Rejuvenate Your Face <h> Topical Solutions <p> Tomato Juice <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , too . Did you know the tomato is useful in ridding yourself of unwanted dark circles ? Mix a teaspoon of tomato juice with half a teaspoon of lemon juice . Apply to your dark circles , and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes . Rinse off with cool water and gently pat dry . Do this twice a day , and you 'll see results in three to four weeks. - <p> Coconut Oil <p> Massaging lightly with organic coconut oil is an effective , though gradual , way to address your dark circles . Bonus " coconut oil eases existing fine lines and wrinkles , and prevents more from developing . Just massage it into the area , and leave it on for a few hours . Repeat this a couple of times a day , till you 're happy with the results . <p> Raw Potato and Cucumber <p> Mix equal parts of peeled raw potato , thickly grated , and grated cucumber , and apply them to affected areas . Letting the mixture sit for 15 minutes . Wipe away , and rinse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then moisturize with coconut oil . Potatoes ' natural bleaching agents will lighten your dark circles and will help reduce any puffiness you may have . <p> Turmeric <p> Turmeric 's anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant properties will help you she 'd your dark circles . It will smooth and soften the skin around your eyes , too . Mix two teaspoons of turmeric and two teaspoons of pineapple juice in a thick paste . Apply the paste to your under-eye area . Leave on for ten minutes . When finished , simply wipe away with a soft cloth . <p> Topical methods , like those just described , can help you rid yourself of those dark circles . But if their cause happens to be reduced collagen , you can supplement the topical treatments by adding more raw foods into your diet . These are natural sources of collagen production , and will lend a powerful hand in banishing your dark circles . <h> Go for Raw Foods <p> First and foremost , a raw foods diet with lots of vegetable juicing for enhanced hydration and nutrient absorption is highly recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which help heal and repair cell damage , and Vitamin K , which aids in blood coagulation and circulation .

Dark , leafy greens are beneficial as well . <h> Vitamin K to the Rescue <p> Vitamin K , also called phytonadione , has been found to benefit the under-eye area when used topically . Researchers believe that the dark circles , which resemble bruises from blood leaking out under the fine skin , are helped by Vitamin K 's blood-clotting effects . <p> Therefore , you want to add a little Vitamin K to your facial cream and apply nightly . This will help to strengthen capillary walls and minimize the appearance of tiny blood vessels in the delicate under-eye area . Vitamin K aids with strengthening weak capillaries and with blood coagulation . How quickly you see improvement will depend upon many things , such as your skin type , pH balance and heredity . But with persistence and a balanced raw food diet , you should definitely see improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil <p> Castor oil is known for its ability to penetrate deep into the skin , leaving it looking supple and fresh .

Believe me , if my raw food diet did n't deliver everything I hoped and more , I would not have ended up where I am today , some 20 years later . I 'm still as firm a believer as I was when I took my first few baby steps . The results have surpassed all my expectations . If you commit to changing not only your diet but your entire lifestyle , then , somewhere down the line , you will agree with me . Diet and life go hand in hand . Once your diet changes , everything else seems to follow suit . It is n't something you necessarily plan on - it just evolves .

Moving thoughtfully to a raw foods diet will serve you best if you do not rely on supplements or superfoods for meeting your nutritional needs ( unless you have a specific deficiency that needs addressing ) . As you progress , be your own researcher , your own experiment . No one will be able to tell you what you as an individual should or should not be eating each day . Everybody is different . For the best basis for your transition , I recommend reading my books in the order they were written - see the page entitled Health Benefits of Raw Foods . <h> Personalization of your raw food diet . <p> What works for one person wo n't always work for you . Have fun with your transition period . Enjoy finding healthy transition recipes as well as raw ones while you establish ever-healthier habits .

Experiencing an enjoyable transition , however short or long , is important not only physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , both in cooked and raw form , while exploring new raw options . Trying new recipes is fun . But not everything needs a " recipe " at all . A bowl of sliced fresh fruit is every bit as delicious , as satisfying , as a recipe with many ingredients and steps . Strive for balance . <p> Find and add in substitutes for your favorite cooked foods , but do n't overdo nuts and heavy dishes . These will cause you as much gastric upset as their damaging cooked counterparts . Stick to the basics - juicing , smoothies , interesting salads - and branch out from there . See my book- Beautiful on Raw : Uncooked Creations <h> Raw Food Diet Plan : Transitioning smoothly <p> Add before you subtract . Begin , that is , by adding raw foods to your present diet , not taking away cooked foods . There are self-styled right-now types who 'll disagree , hard-headed purists who 'll cringe at the very thought of including anything , in any diet ever , that does n't meet their stringent standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with me . Practically speaking , it 's a very helpful mindset . You 're not taking anything away from yourself , or depriving yourself of favorite treats . Rather , you are gifting your self with vital , life-bringing foods , spicing your life with fresh flavors and colors . Start this way , and you 'll soon be finding yourself adding in more and more of them . New discoveries will come - gradually , sometimes without your even knowing - to replace those " meat and potatoes " items you once thought essential . This way , you 'll find your transition a joy - not a burden . A game to be played with delight - not a set of prison-yard rules to be obeyed <p> The best thing to add , and maybe your first , is daily fresh vegetable juice . Juicing is king , as I point out in my blog article Are We Getting Enough Nutrients ? <p> Give yourself the gift every diet in transition needs - forgiveness . Be patient as you strive to change habits . Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin - to fall off the wagon now and then . Berating yourself for yesterday 's steak sandwich will likely do more damage than your lunch choice did . Besides , that was yesterday 's lunch , and you ca n't fix it - you can only fix today 's and tomorrow 's . So ... learn from your mistakes . Your raw-foods transition is a process , a journey - not an event . Be ready to do a lot of experimenting along the way so that you know what works best for your individual body and lifestyle . <p> Health - not disease - is my expertise . I am not a doctor of any kind . Nor do I have any " alternative " health care training . My interest and my focus are health , not disease , so I do n't involve myself in medical issues .

You will be astounded at how much seemingly effortless progress you can make if you practice what I call the " take one , leave one ' principle . Every week , two weeks , or if you want to take it slower , take one more dietary or lifestyle practice or change at the same time that you leave one out .

If we look around in nature , we see humans are the only creatures using houses with insulation and further protect ourselves from variations in temperature with heaters , air conditioning and clothing . <h> Why do We Need to Wear Clothing ? <p> Humans are the only ones wearing clothing because we do n't adapt well to widely differing temperatures " we simply have n't the thermoregulation many other species do . Artificially regulating our temperature , even though it makes us more comfortable , actually disables our natural capacity to thermoregulate .

Why ? I believe this is a temporary manifestation while the body adjusts its thermostat . Over time , as many long term raw food eaters have reported , this will level out , and extremes of temperature wo n't bother you anymore . Most raw food eaters , and I 'm included , admit to feeling cold when switching to raw foods , but end up feeling warmer and adjusting much more easily to changes in temperature after some time .

Now that I 'm pretty much where I want to be weight wise , it 's also easy to maintain if I am consistent with my health practices including dry brushing , exercise , juicing and a high raw food diet . <p> If I just sat around eating raw foods and waiting for the weight to fall off , I do n't think I would have been successful because it takes a more balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards applying the Quantum Eating principles , I am delighted to realize that regaining the weight need never be a concern .

When it comes to weight loss on a raw food diet , no two people are alike . Every experience is unique . <p> People overeat before switching to raw foods because their bodies are constantly hungry , craving and crying out for nutrients that they are not getting . After making the switch to the raw food diet , eventually you are getting enough nourishment , as well as fiber from your food , so that you are satisfied with less . Your body is also processing and assimilating better , so you actually do n't need as much . You get more nutrition from less food. -

It is normal to have bloating , gas and even bowel spasms during the cleansing period . This is only temporary . <p> Coarse , raw living vegetables contain dietary bulk , and this indigestible material with fibrous structure acts as an intestinal scraper . These cramps are an indication that an inactive and impacted colon is being forced to work , and that your flaccid and sluggish intestines are toning up . <h> Slow and Steady is the Key <p> That is why it is wise to change your diet gradually . You are internally unfit to consume a lot of fiber . Raw food does not weaken the digestive system , it is the digestive system that is too weak to handle the increased amount of fiber . Since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propels the food as it moves , it takes time for it to become fit on the inside , just as time is needed to become fit on the outside . <p> If feeling good came instantly after starting the raw food diet , then there would be no need for presenting a convincing argument . However , some people try the raw foods diet just to lose weight and a few weeks later begin to experience uncomfortable reactions . These are cleansing symptoms and they are usually used as arguments against this lifestyle . <p> Every change in your habits should be made gradually . My ebook " 100 Days to 100% Raw " has a step by step program to guide you through this . Do n't expect to become a raw food eater in a day , a week , not even a month . Sudden changes can become immediately destructive to the body , even if the change is from bad to good . Give time for each new practice to get your body accustomed to it . <p> Keep in mind the extreme example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body inch by inch , day by day . But sudden deprivation causes suffering , violent withdrawal reactions and sometimes even death . <p> Although there are no hard and fast rules about improving your eating habits , I would offer you one caution : think small . One of the worst mistakes most beginning raw food eaters make is thinking big , trying to go cold turkey . Keep your steps small and focused . <h> Raw Food Ca n't Hurt You <p> The important thing to remember is that raw food can not hurt you . The raw food diet will initiate elimination of toxic waste at the cellular level . This process will happen even faster if you perform juice fasts , so be gradual . The body will purge everything it has no use for and work on dissolving tumors , ulcers , abnormal growths , cancers , abscesses and fibrous masses . Deep seated diseases you did not suspect you had might surface . Fevers , skin eruptions , and nausea can occur . Do not let this distress you . Try to rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've Got to Get Down to Get Up <p> If your body is full of toxins , the only way to get better is to feel worse first . If cleansing is done too fast , you will experience the symptoms of your former ills again . Sometimes several at a time so you will not feel good . All these symptoms will be less pronounced or absent entirely if you make the change gradually . <h> Consider Colonics <p> These are detoxification symptoms that have therapeutic benefits . They are not adverse side effects . Do not be fearful of these changes . What is going on in the body is too marvelous to expect results without paying the small price of temporary discomfort . If you are not feeling well after going 100% raw , it would be a good idea to resort to colon hydrotherapy . It will make a big difference in easing your cleansing reactions .

The current use of the word is almost never associated with its true meaning . Natural beauty embodies authenticity , which is beyond human craft and human creativity . <p> The natural world is filled with beauty . It delights us with its magnificent colors and extraordinary designs . God 's artistic taste and superior craftsmanship are manifested in spectacular sunsets and diminutive snowflakes . We experience nature and exclaim in adoration : " How great Thou art ! " But what about our own image -the one we view in the mirror ? <p> Most of us are not pleased with what we see . Why do plants and animals often display greater visual beauty than God 's favorite creation - the human being ? Ordinarily all flowers are beautiful and only a wilted flower looks abnormal . And yet humankind calls less than one percent of the adult population officially beautiful . Double chins , protruding stomachs , and sallow complexions are seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was created in the image of God , the Supreme Beauty . In Genesis 1:29 we read : " And shall be for food . ' " God 's original diet of raw fruits , vegetables , nuts and seeds is the most suitable one for the human body . It is salubrious to the body 's health and salutary to its beauty . The raw food diet is awesome ; therefore I decided to call it the Rawsome diet . But when our actions are in opposition with nature , the results are different types of bodily ills , deformities and ugliness . <p> Eating cooked food leaves residues that the body can not utilize and often results in disease . The body responds to everything that is not fully digested and properly eliminated as abnormal substance . The body will pocket it as far away from the vital organs as possible-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer appearance . <p> Most of us feel that our appearance lacks something . In reality , ugliness is more about excess than lack . Toxic accumulations in our bodies are responsible for stealing our health , youthfulness and attractiveness . Your beauty is likely buried alive under cushions of retained fluids , deposits of fat and layers of sick tissues . You must take action to revitalize it and your uncovered beauty will surprise and delight you . <p> Since there can be no natural beauty without eating 100% natural food , most of you have never seen the natural you . The ability to renew cells is built into the body , so the body alone can make you look more attractive . We were designed to bloom continuously and the raw food diet makes the most of this rejuvenating ability of our bodies . It restores the integrity of every cell and facilitates the optimal operation of every organ inside and out . <p> Only the body that is sustained on raw food will host natural beauty , or as I call it : rawsome beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but one that is cultivated from the inside by nutritionally charged food . The Rawsome Diet will clarify and refine your features and add delicacy to your face . The artistic ability of your body will amaze you .

Everything that is bumpy or lumpy will be smoothed or straightened . Everything that is dull will be illuminated . The features will be carved until a lovely face surfaces , and the skin will be polished until it glows . <p> Regular features are not essential for the whole effect to be seen as beautiful .

I became very fatigued , developed itchy skin , high cholesterol , thyroid problems , cramping in my legs and my spleen was enlarged .

My family and I now live a much healthier and happier lifestyle . <p> I just had my last test update . My blood test came back better than normal : absolutely no sign of osteoporosis or arthritis ! My spleen has shrunk back down to normal , and the doctor could n't find any signs of cirrhosis on my liver . Without medication ! Pretty amazing , considering that I was told there was no cure . It scared me , I took actions , and the raw foods sure saved my life . My story is proof that we are what we eat .

Examples of intrinsic factors include early exposure to certain chemicals such as tetracycline or excess fluoride . Both of these can stain teeth . These types of stains inhere in the tooth itself and you ca n't remove them simply by brushing . <p> Extrinsic factors , on the other hand , include food and drink that stains " for example , coffee , wine or other highly acidic foods .

Yet another reason , folks , not to cook your food ! <h> Erosion and Cracks in the Enamel are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pure white , but rather more white-ish . As we age , teeth tend to darken slightly because the dentin ( the dental tissue , just under the enamel , which determines tooth size and shape ) becomes exposed due to inevitable erosion and cracks in the surface enamel . The dentin , less dense than enamel , absorbs food colors more easily . Stained teeth is often one reason people on the raw food diet go in search of natural whitening products , when in fact they might just need to re-enamelize their teeth . <h> Chew Leafy Greens for Remineralization <p> Chewing leafy greens daily on the raw food diet will accomplish this remineralization and help to build the enamel . This method will also stimulate the saliva production so essential to healthy teeth and gums .

Can the raw food diet help ? <p> According to research done by Bristol-Meyers , there are approximately 20 million American women who must remove facial hair at least once a week . Hirsutism has a wide variety of causes , and is not only a cosmetic concern , but the underlying issue is a hormonal imbalance . The condition can be addressed with the raw foods diet . <p> Throughout our lives all women produce a certain amount of male hormones known as ' androgens .

Most so-called improvements in food production serve only to increase yields while making the food less nutritious . For instance , selective breeding to increase size and yield results in higher carbohydrate content , but lower mineral and amino acid content . <p> Chemical pesticides and fertilizers not only strip nutrients and imbalance the soil , but retard maturing and ripening , because crops are grown quicker for harvesting sooner . This reduces the time plants would otherwise use to absorb nutrients from the soil . And just because a vegetable is big does n't mean it contains more nutrition . A larger size often serves only to dilute the vitamin and mineral content amid the bulk which the produce industry calls dry matter .

Virginia Worthington , a champion for the organic food movement , compiled the results of thirty different studies which compared 300 vegetables .

She 'll often come to class with a story about a family member coming down with a sore throat , a fever , a stomach ailment , and how she cured it using Ayurvedic medicine . Ayurveda is the earliest school of medicine known to humans . <h> Ayurvedic and TCM <p> Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine share several similaritiesBoth use diet , herbs and lifestyle practices to balance different body types in order to cure or prevent illness or imbalance that may lead to disease . And both have been successfully practiced in India and China for thousands of years . <p> Ayurvedic medicine is based on the notion that there are three main body types or doshas : the vata , the kapha , and the pitta types . These body types , though they tend to overlap , also coincide with the hot or cool , damp or dry properties of the elements " earth , air , fire and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , here , Traditional Chinese Medicine , or TCM " is based on the interrelation of two opposing energies called yin and yang , and how they correspond to the five elements of traditional Chinese culture " water , wood , fire , earth and metal " and the flow of life force or chi within the body . <p> Raw-food health seekers , by the way , find consternation in the fact that the Ayurvedic and Chinese traditions both stand generally opposed to all-raw diets for the majority of people . <h> Why the Need for So Many Cures ? <p> But back to my instructorIt 's fabulous that my yoga instructor can cure these disorders . But I ca n't help thinking : Why are they getting sick in the first place ? If a cooked food diet is considered healthier and safer by either train of thought , Ayurvedic or TCM , why the need for so many cures ? In my mind , the only reason they have so many ailments is because their diet is not delivering abundant , radiant health . <p> Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to survive , through much of their development , eating whatever was available " for most of this time , cooked grains . Since eating large amounts of cooked grains is so deeply entrenched in these cultures , perhaps for them there will always be a need for remedies and medicines . It is much easier to find an herb to balance your blood sugar than to stop eating rice " if rice is the most abundant and inexpensive food in your country . <p> You 'll note that my latest book Raw Foods and Hot Yoga , like most other books in the raw foods field , gives no remedies for common ailments colds , headaches , edema and so on . Why ? Because these problems generally disappear when you follow a well-tailored raw food regimen . That is the key to balance : tailoring your raw food regimen . <p> Conceived and handled properly , the raw food diet can work hand in hand with Ayurvedic or TCM principles by individualizing the diet for optimum health and constitutional balance . Dr. Gabriel Cousens , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happens to be an ambassador for Ayurvedic medicine , and has been on raw foods for many years . He has written some excellent books offering a wealth of valuable information on balancing the various body types , while following a 100 percent raw food diet . Another author well qualified to help you succeed on an all-raw diet , yet also adhering to Ayurvedic principles is Dr. Walter Shantee Kacera . Also , the raw foodist Brigitte Mars , well trained in Chinese medicine , demonstrates that it is entirely possible to succeed on a raw foods diet despite claims that it leads to imbalances and problems . <h> Listen to Your Body <p> If you are eating entirely from your dogma " or from your head " you may run into problems . Listen to your body . I , along with others , have found that you will often crave the type of raw food your body needs , and be repelled by the kinds it does n't .

This , I believe , will go a long way toward helping you to stay acclimated and balanced . If you live in Michigan , do n't try to eat pineapple every day in January . In a cold climate , you can eat raw foods and herbs with warming qualities . In a hot climate , you can eat foods with cooling , hydrating qualities . <p> But diet is just a start to radiant , robust health . You must also get the exercise , sleep , fasting and relaxation that your body type calls for . Again , incorporating ideas from either Ayurvedic or TCM , as you may prefer , can be a superb way to ensure you do n't run into problems . <h> Ounce of Prevention ... <p> If I were to need medicinal help , treatment or other assistance , I would definitely pursue help with Ayurvedic or TCM , as these are both more natural and ancient methods , which I consider to be superior to conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , these traditions seem to have a richer understanding of the inner workings of the human body . I also know , from personal experience , that a 100 percent raw food diet has in no way harmed me or caused me imbalances , or a damp spleen , ' or any other pesky condition that , in theory , can happen on an all-raw diet . Things do n't have to be black and white . Ancient lifestyle and medicinal practices are natural and helpful , should you need what they have to offer . At the same time , by following an intelligent , well tailored raw food lifestyle , I have found that an ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure .

@@62451088 @2451088/ <p> Karen Ranzi 's book marries the two most important foundations for creating healthy children : the raw food diet and attachment parenting , a term originally used by pediatrician William Sears in describing a more natural and intuitive parenting philosophy than most people in this day and age practice . Attachment parenting sheds light on the truths about raising and truly ' nurturing ' children from the heart and not the head . I loved reading about the mothers , and fathers returning to the practice of following their parenting instincts and each child 's individual needs for the mutual benefit of all , and not following whatever current popular parenting trend comes along . <p> From the first few pages , I was thoroughly engrossed . Karen 's writing style is very easy to read , yet highly informative . This book was seven years in the making and it shows .

It also includes information on vaccinations , circumcision , exercise , education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every stage of a child 's life , transitioning older kids to the raw food diet , meeting emotional needs , and would you believe there 's more ? <p> You can see that no stone is left unturned and it seems every aspect of a child 's life is examined in light of the raw vegan lifestyle , not merely diet . By the time I was done reading the hefty question and answer section from real people with real life questions , I realized how valuable this book will be . It will help ease the minds of parents and soon-to-be 's , showing them that having healthy , natural children and families is entirely possible and within their grasp if they are willing to follow their hearts and dedicate themselves to this most noble of tasks . There is such a lovely balance of first hand experience and nutritional research related between the covers of this book that no one , parent or not , could read it without becoming thoroughly informed about avoiding the most common pitfalls in the raw food diet . <p> By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had already taken away an entire book worth of valuable and motivating information and had hardly scratched the surface . Nearly every page is peppered with research , resources , personal experiences , websites , quotes from experts , and even recipes .
