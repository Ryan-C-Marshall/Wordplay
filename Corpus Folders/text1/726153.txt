It has given me effortless access to unlimited reserves of energy , creativity and happiness deep within . This level of life is sometimes called " pure consciousness " " it is a treasury . And this level of life is deep within us all . <p> But I had no idea how powerful and profound this technique could be until I saw firsthand how it was being practiced by young children in inner-city schools , veterans who suffer the living hell of post-traumatic stress disorder and women and girls who are victims of terrible violence . <p> TM is , in a word , life changing for the good . <p> In 2005 , we started the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace to ensure that every child anywhere in the world who wanted to learn to meditate could do so . Now , the Foundation is actively teaching TM to adults and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it ? Because of the generosity of foundations and philanthropists and everyday people who want to ease the suffering of others " and who want to help create a better world . <p> If you do n't  already meditate , take my advice : Start .

These results suggest that TM may modulate the physiological response to stress and improve coronary heart disease risk factors . <p> Extended Longevity ( American Journal of Cardiology , May 2005 ) This study was a first-of-its-kind , long-term , randomized trial . It evaluated the death rates of 202 men and women , average age 71 , who had mildly elevated blood pressure . Subjects in the study participated in the Transcendental Meditation program ; behavioral techniques , such as mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation ; or health education .

Blood pressure in the Transcendental Meditation group reduced by nearly 6 mm diastolic pressure and 3 mm systolic pressure . In contrast , blood pressure in the progressive muscle relaxation group and conventional health education classes reduced by 3 mm diastolic pressure , with no change in systolic pressure . Use of hypertensive medication was also found to significantly decrease in the TM group in comparison with controls . <p> Reduced Blood Pressure in At-risk Teens ( American Journal of Hypertension , April 2004 ) This $1.5M , four-year , randomized , controlled study found that adolescents at risk for heart disease experienced decreased blood pressure as a result of the daily practice of Transcendental Meditation . <p> Reduced Atherosclerosis ( American Journal of Cardiology , April 2002 ) This study found that subjects with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease substantially reduced atherosclerosis through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily practice of Transcendental Meditation . In the study , 57 adults were randomly assigned into three treatment groups . After one year , the ceratoid intima-media thickness decreased significantly more in the subjects who were randomly assigned to the TM group . <p> Reduced Thickening of Coronary Arteries ( Stroke , March 2000 ) A study found that the daily practice of the TM technique reduced the thickening of coronary arteries in hypertensive adults , thereby decreasing the risk of heart attack and stroke . After 6 to 9 months , carotid intima-media thickness decreased in the TM group as compared to matched control subjects . This reduction was similar to that achieved by lipid-lowering drugs and extensive lifestyle changes . <p> Reduced Constriction of Blood Vessels ( Psychosomatic Medicine , July 1999 and January 1999 ) A study of middle-aged adults reported that the TM technique reduced blood pressure by reducing constriction of the blood vessels ( vasoconstriction ) , thereby decreasing the risk of heart disease .

" <h> TM Research <h> Medical College of Georgia <h> Transcendental Meditation Lowers Blood Pressure in Black Adolescents <p> ( April 2 , 2004 ) Black adolescents at risk to be hypertensive adults can lower their blood pressure through daily Transcendental Meditation , according to research published in the April issue of the American Journal of Hypertension . <p> A study of 156 inner-city black adolescents in Augusta , Ga. , with high-normal pressure showed that teens who practiced 15 minutes of Transcendental Meditation twice daily steadily lowered their daytime blood pressures over four months and that their pressures tended to stay lower , according to Dr. Vernon A. Barnes , physiologist at the Medical College of Georgia and principal author of the paper . <p> " Allowing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there for a time has an effect on the physiology by reducing stress hormone levels like cortisol and reducing activation of the sympathetic nervous system which controls the fight-or-flight response , " says Dr. Barnes . " In a short time , we can teach this standardized meditation method that has been taught all over the world for 50 years . That technique can then be used throughout a lifetime without side effects or additional expense . " <p> Adolescents in the study who practiced Transcendental Meditation experienced an average 3.5 millimeter drop in their systolic pressure , the top number that indicates the pressure inside blood vessels that the heart is pumping against , and a 3.4 millimeter decrease in diastolic pressure , the bottom number that indicates pressure while the heart is at rest . <p> Participants in health education classes , who served as the control groups , experienced no significant change . Heart rate , probably one of the simplest measures of stress level reduction , also dropped in meditating students and remained consistent in the control groups , Dr. Barnes says . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are young , if you can maintain that into adulthood , you can significantly reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease , " he says . <p> High blood pressure affects one in four adults in the U.S. and is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke , the first and third leading causes of death , respectively , according to the National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . " This is not a problem that occurs suddenly at age 45 or 50 , " Dr. Barnes says . " High blood pressure starts at a young age and it seems its starting at a younger age than we have previously thought . So we wanted to look at intervention with young people , specifically young African-Americans who likely will have the most severe problems with hypertension when they grow up . " <p> Dr. Barnes first identified students with high-normal pressure based on three consecutive screenings in the Richmond County , Ga. , school system , then randomly assigned them to the Transcendental Meditation program or a 15-minute health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included no intervention . <p> The Transcendental Meditation group meditated for 15 minutes twice daily once at school and once at home and twice daily at home during the weekend . To ensure an accurate measure of blood pressure as the adolescents went about their lives , both groups wore 24-hour monitoring devices to check their blood pressure every 20 minutes from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. and every 30 minutes from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m . Researchers also looked at parameters such as body mass index , weight , body surface area and environmental stress so that other changes that might affect blood pressure would be noted . <p> " Once the program stopped , we had a follow-up at four months and their blood pressures were still down , " Dr. Barnes says , but long-term studies are needed to see the impact of reduced pressure on disease development . <p> He noted that underlying physiologic pathways that enable meditation to lower blood pressure are unclear and also need further study . However , the practice that transcends thought has been shown to reduce sympathetic nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heart . " These events may result in improved myocardial and vascular function , leading to decreased ( blood pressure ) levels , thereby helping to prevent early onset of hypertension , " he and his colleagues at MCGs Georgia Prevention Institute write . <p> He says that the health benefits of Transcendental Meditation are becoming more accepted in the medical community as these types of studies document its impact on the body and mind . The willingness of the teens to practice meditation is evidence , although perhaps less traditional documentation , of its benefits as well . " How do you get a teen-ager to sit for 15 minutes with his eyes closed twice a day every day for a long period of time ? How can you possibly accomplish that ? " he asks rhetorically . <p> The technique , which enables the most settled , relaxed state of mind , is an easy sell once people practice it , says Dr. Barnes , who has used the technique since 1972 and taught it since 1974 . " Anyone can meditate and anyone can benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of stress and you do n't  have to be hypertensive . There are many benefits in terms of developing your own potential , " he says , equating the experience to a mental bath that washes away the stress of the day . <p> Dr. Barnes research was supported by funding from the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute and an American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant .

When evaluating programs , we segment outcomes into two categories , self- and non-self-reported . Self-reported outcomes are primarily measured using surveys done before and after learning TM . Some self-reported outcomes include changes in : <p> Anxiety <p> Fatigue <p> Trauma Symptoms <p> Depression <p> When evaluating our programs we regularly see large improvements in these measures after individuals have learned TM . Our goal is to partner with social service providers that measure non-self reported outcomes to assess the effect of learning TM on these measures . Some examples of non-self-reported outcomes include : <p> Employment placement and retention rates <p> School suspensions <p> T-cell counts ( for individuals with HIV ) <p> Recidivism rates <p> DLF is committed to funding projects that are designed to evaluate TM 's effect on non-self-reported outcome measures as a means to lead to systemic adoption of TM as a social service modality for populations in which it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , we will look at not only the proposed program , but also experience tracking and reporting on the outcomes they propose measuring . <p> Entities eligible to apply for funding in this program area include : <p> A 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization . <p> A government social service provider . <p> A Transcendental Meditation Teacher in partnership with a 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit or government agency .

" <h> TM Research <h> Cedars-Sinai Medical Center <p> Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles conducted a 16-week trial of Transcendental Meditation in patients with coronary heart disease .
