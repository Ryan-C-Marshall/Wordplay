It 's already here and making a big impact on business . <p> For those that are still confused by the term , the Internet of Things is simply technology that uses the internet to send and receive data . And it 's all around us ; we can monitor our health via a watch , keep track of gas and electric using a smart meter , turn on our central heating using a phone , and set the Nespresso machine to make us a coffee . The list goes on . <p> In the business world too , the Internet of Things is being used by many companies . Rolls Royce constantly monitors its aircraft engines ' performance whilst in flight , UPS monitors mileage , speed and engine health of its fleet , Disney World uses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theme park. - The National Trust even used IoT technology to keep track of its cows . <p> As you can see , the Internet of Things can bring big benefits for both businesses and their consumers and as more and more businesses take up its use , it 's the ones who do n't  who are being left behind . <p> So , if you have not thought about it before , here are nine ways the Internet of Things can affect your business . <h> The Benefits <h> Collecting precious data <p> One of the main ways businesses use the Internet of Things is collect data about their products . By having a detailed understanding of how different customers use your products , it makes it much easier to analyse how you can make your products more useful for them in the future . For example , an IoT-enabled training shoe could lead to soles which help athletes run faster on different surfaces or prevent joggers getting knee injuries . <h> Communication with customers <p> Three-quarters of consumers believe good customer service is vital when choosing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and present it in a consumer-friendly way , it is possible to provide customers with helpful data above and beyond the normal expectations of customer service . For example , a swimming app could analyse which types of stroke have the most positive effects on health and can let other swimmers know how to improve their fitness . Similarly , if manufacturers of products could monitor how frequently individual parts lasted , they could detect when customers would need a replacement and then remind them to order a new one . <h> Clearer business inventory controls <p> Using IoT devices can give businesses a much clearer and up to the minute understanding of stock and of their use of resources . The IoT makes it much easier to keep track of where things are , what 's been sold or used , what 's been damaged , etc . Analysis of this data can improve efficiencies , ensure stock and resources do not run out and help keep finances in check by preventing over ordering . <p> By using smart technology to share this information , it can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . <h> Reduce environmental impact <p> IoT devices that monitor how you use energy can have a big impact in helping your company become more environmentally friendly . There are numerous ways this can be achieved , such as finding better routes for transport , monitoring room usage so that lighting and air-conditioning are shut down when a room is empty , and analysing the use of perishable resources to reduce waste . <p> The other benefit , of course , is that by being greener , there is usually a reduction in overheads that benefits your company financially . <h> Improved safety and security <p> Many of the current CCTV and access control products now available are IoT-enabled and bring with them lots of safety and security advantages . As a business owner , it is possible to view what is going at in your premises from anywhere in the world . CCTV systems are now so sophisticated they can spot and track suspicious behaviour and report it directly to security companies or the police . <p> Access control devices not only control who can enter the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are , book rooms and resources , keep tabs on attendance and punctuality , prevent overcrowding and , in emergency situations , can be used to direct people to the safest route out of the building . <h> The Challenges <h> Updating to the new IoT technology <p> If you are going to embrace the benefits that the IoT has to offer , then you will also need to invest in both IoT-enabled devices and the software that is needed to gather and analyse the data you are collecting . Depending on what you want to achieve and the technology required this could be a significant capital investment " but one with an even more significant RoI . <p> However , technological developments move at a pace ; microchips with built-in sensors and wireless connectivity are getting cheaper all the time . Indeed , many products now already come IoT-enabled . According to Gartner Inc. , there will be 6.4 billion IoT devices online by the end of this year . That 's a 30% increase on 2015 . By 2020 , the estimate is for 20.8 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use IoT technology is vital if you are going to make it work for your business so it is important that you also invest in training staff to use the devices and how to adapt to the new business practices and procedures that the IoT will inevitably bring . <h> Challenges in online security <p> One of the downsides of moving to an environment that relies on the Internet of Things is that the devices can be susceptible to hacking . We 've already seen instances reported on the news about drones which can be taken over mid-flight and the potential for IoT-enabled pacemakers to be turned off . In addition , malware can be installed on a great many IoT devices to render them useless or to carry out malicious activities . Even a child 's toy that stores data can be used to send spam . <p> For businesses that use these devices , it is important that you employ the most robust security measures to safeguard your system and protect any consumers whose data you collect and use . <h> Changes to your hosting <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will be starting to use what is known as Big Data " the collection and analyses of very large amounts of data . In order to do this , you will obviously need greater storage capacity for that data ; the ability to scale up when demand is high ; increased processing power to analyse the data ; better performance to deal with the speed at which data is collected ; unlimited bandwidth in order to constantly collect your data ; and in addition , high availability to ensure your IoT devices do not go offline . <p> Whilst this can be achieved by creating your own data centre , the capital expenditure is likely to be significant . By far the most cost-efficient and quickest way to enable your business to cope with the increased demands of using IoT devices is by opting for a cloud hosting solution . This can provide you with all the hardware and computing resources you require without the need for capital expenditure . It will also provide you with a fully managed , high availability service and the ability to scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Conclusion <p> The Internet of Things is already making an impact on the way businesses operate and this will increase rapidly as more and more everyday objects and devices become internet enabled . From reading this article , you should now be aware of how businesses can benefit from collecting data from IoT devices and should also understand the challenges that come with them . <p> If you are considering using IoT devices in your business and need to examine your computing capacity , take a look at our cloud hosting packages . @qwx190776 <p> Use Buyer 's Keywords to get potential customers to your site The main problem faced by many internet marketers is getting laser-targeted visitors to his website .

As the internet developed , the need grew for dynamic web pages , which appear differently for individual users , for example , users who log in to a site will see different content depending on their status , preferences or previous activity . <p> Dynamic pages also allow content to be displayed differently for different devices and they can be updated in real time , such as showing which products are in your shopping basket or the latest score in a football match . <p> To enable a web page to display dynamic content for different users and devices requires scripting . Scripting is the process whereby the interactive elements of a web page are retrieved from the website 's database or other data stores on the site 's server . There are two types of scripting which can occur : server-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information needed to create the dynamic page is done on the web server before being sent to the user . This is done using scripting languages such as PHP , ASP.NET and Python . Client side scripting means the script is sent to the web browser and the browser uses that script to procure and collate the page 's content on the user 's device . <h> Advantages of Server-Side Scripting : <p> In order for client side scripting to work , browsers need plugins and scripting technologies like JavaScript to compile all the information . This increases the load on the user 's computer and can lead to problems such as slow loading , high CPU usage and even freezing " especially if it is an older computer . Server-side scripting prevents this from happening . <p> Some browsers do n't fully support Javascript , so server-side scripting is essential to run dynamic pages on these browsers . <p> Server-side scripting languages like PHP can be configured to run CMS applications , like WordPress and Joomla . This allows CMS users to easily create and update content on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripting often reduces the loading time for web pages which can improve the Google ranking of your site and prevent users leaving because of issues with site speed . <p> As the scripting takes place on the server , the script itself is not sent to the browser , this prevents it being copied , cloned or scrutinised for hacking vulnerabilities . <p> Server-side scripting offers greater protection for user privacy and is the preferred option for e-commerce , membership and social media sites . <h> Disadvantages of Server-Side Scripting : <p> Scripting puts increased demands on a website 's server . Websites using large applications and with heavy traffic may need to utilise more powerful hosting methods such as dedicated servers or cloud hosting to cope with demand . <p> Server-side scripting requires pages to be refreshed in order to show the dynamic content " you will most often see this when you use server-side scripting to log in to a site . However , developers now use a newer method of exchanging data with a server , called Ajax , and this allows web pages to be updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Server-side scripting requires a database in order to store the dynamic data . This is not an issue in itself , but the database will need backing up regularly and will need to be kept secure . <p> The majority of websites now use dynamic content , much of which is managed using server-side scripting .

@@14548696 @3148696/ <h> The 6 Cs Of Marketing <h> The 6 Cs Of Marketing <p> In this day and age , a companys marketing strategy needs to be customer focused.Its about understanding the target consumer ; their wants , needs and motivations.Not as demographics , psychographics or any other graphics , but as real people . Its understanding why customers do what they do ( or do n't  do ) , when they do it and why they do it . Such knowledge is critical in marketing since having a strong Understanding of buyer behavior will help shed light on what is important to the customer . Its about focusing on the target customer first and then working back to the brand . Its imperative that companies have mindshare before focusing on market share . <p> CONSISTENCY : <p> Companies need to maintain consistency in their message ; a practice called integrated marketing communications from packaging and advertising to sales promotion and publicity . This will maintain and reinforce a brands personality and image in a real life context and avoid doing something brainless like changing the distinctive color of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about . <p> CREATIVITY : <p> Creativity is imperative to attract attention in a world cluttered with thousands of messages . Creativity means laying aside the rules , and engages in out-of-box thinking so that marketers can reach beyond logic and structure and tap into their imaginations . <p> * Creativity Persuades : The ancients Greeks created legends and myths about gods and heroes -symbols for humankinds instinctive longings and fears to influence human behavior and thought . Todays marketers are doing the same thing ; they are creating new myths , heroes and symbols like Ronald McDonald , the " Can You Hear Me Now " guy from Verizon , and more recently the Gecko from Geico Insurance . <p> * Creativity Reminds : Imagine using the same invitation , without any creativity , to remind people to try a particular product everyday for a month . The invitation would become stale very quickly . Only creativity can transform boring reminders into interesting , entertaining marketing communications . Nike is proof . Several commercials in a Nike campaign never mention the company name or even spelled it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , the only on-screen cue identifying the sponsor was a single " swoosh " logo inscribed on the final scene . <p> CULTURE : <p> All marketing communications needs cross-cultural research to be able to succeed . It 's simple to see things from your own perspective , assuming that everyone else in the world thinks exactly like you and should understand what 's so great about your product or service . Just reading about all the mistakes made by large corporations proves that even the most sizable and experienced marketers have made errors time and again . <p> One of the most famous examples is Coca Cola translating the name into Chinese without back-translating it ( " bite the wax tadpole&amp;quot ; ) , ultimately were resulting in a horrible response from an insulted society . Marketing books are full of examples like these . As David Ogilvy , known as the Father of Advertising , states , " if you are trying to persuade people to do something , or buy something , it seems to me you should use their language , the language in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic . Consumers do n't  want to be " marketed to " Rather , they want to be " communicated with " Good marketing communication creates value with target customers , speaks in their language and tells your story . Its about building long term , trustworthy , and profitable relationships with your customers . As Seth Godin states , its about reinforcing the lies that consumers tell themselves everyday ( i.e. I look much better in these jeans from Abercrombie ; they make me look sexy ) . <p> CHANGE : <p> Marketing is not just a business function , but a process . There is a beginning , middle , but there is never an end . Marketers must constantly CHANGE as society changes . They should never be afraid to try something new . Marketing today is not what it was 2 5 or even 20 years ago . Marketing needs to be an evolving process that considers change in the world , economy , market , consumers ; as well as internal change within the organization . <h> Sharing <h> 3 Comments <p> Bob <p> October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial time to understand the connection between marketing and bottom line results . <p> Adam <p> October 14 , 2006 at 9:57 am <p> Marketing Guru Seth Godin once told to a journalist " The key to successful marketing is to to create and deliver an attractive content that they could make use of and even would like to share with their friends . <p> Edward <p> October 13 , 2006 at 10:44 am <p> Cross culture research and better communication system is difinitely good point .

@@14548699 @3148699/ <h> 10 Advantages and Disadvantages of having Smartphone <p> 19-09-2012 , 14:43 <p> Nearly everyone has a mobile phone and the vast majority of these are smartphones that allow users to connect to the internet and run apps as well as sending texts and making phone calls . Whilst they are amazing gadgets , they are not without their issues and to give you a better understanding here ? s a list of 10 advantages and disadvantages of smartphones . <p> Advantages of having a smartphone <p> 1 . With a smartphone , waiting for things becomes less of a pain because you can keep yourself entertained ; for example , you can read the news , play games , listen to music or watch a movie . It can make your commute to the office or those four hours waiting to get seen in A&amp;amp ; E just fly by . <p> 2 . Complaining about products and services becomes a whole lot easier when you can do it through Twitter and Facebook on your smartphone . Many companies now use social media as a part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do it anywhere . <p> 3 . Having a smartphone makes it much more convenient to check your email , social media or even you bank account while on the go . Need to look at your bank balance before making a purchase ? Not a problem . <p> 4 . With a smartphone , you ? re no longer going to get in hot water using your company ? s computer to chat with your friends whilst you are at work . Instead , you can keep your conversations away from the business ? s network , protect your privacy and stay within your employer ? s IT usage policy . <p> 5 . With so many public Wi-Fi hotspots popping up , smartphones enable you to cut down your reliance on your phone network to get connected . This means you can do more surfing without the need to eat into your data allowance . Do be careful though , not all hotspots are secure . <p> 6 . Smartphones can be great for drivers . You can use smartphone apps , like Google Maps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid traffic jams . You can even connect your phone to your car ? s audio system and blast out your favourite tunes whilst you ? re driving . <p> 7 . If you are out and about looking for something to do , smartphones can be the ideal tool to find the perfect entertainment or restaurant . Using apps like Foursquare , you can get up to the minute information on where to go and what to do ? all based on your current location . You can also find reviews and even get money off vouchers . <p> 8 . As a smartphone is essentially a small screen computer , it means you can carry out a wide range of tasks when on the go , for example , you can use your phone to order your groceries , write a report , turn on the central heating and play Angry Birds . <p> 9 . As your apps can connect to and sync in the cloud , you can have access to all your information and files , no matter where you are . Using online storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can get hold of important information wherever you are . And by using the huge variety of apps available , you can do things like publish a blog post , edit your photos or update a spreadsheet . <p> 10 . Recent advances in technology mean you can now use your mobile phone in a similar way to a contactless bank card and pay for things just by tapping the screen . <p> Disadvantages of having a smartphone <p> 1 . Phones can be addictive and spending too much time on them can make you socially isolated from the real world . You should avoid becoming obsessed with constantly checking it . Resist the urge as it can develop into compulsive behaviour . <p> 2 . Overuse of smartphones has led to the development of a smartphone etiquette . There are certain social situations where it is just not acceptable to have a phone . For example , it ? s not considered polite to interrupt a conversation to check an incoming text , nor do many people feel it ? s appropriate to take a phone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ? t let your smartphone habits turn you into a rude person . <p> 3 . You will lose your smartphone . Several times a day . You ? ll leave it in the car , at the office , down the side of the sofa , under the duvet . And when you try to ring it , either the battery will have gone or you ? ll have left it on silent . Don ? t worry , it turns up ? usually . <p> 4 . Smartphones are expensive . If you just have to have the latest all singing , all dancing model then you will be paying either a large sum to buy the phone outright or quite a bit for your monthly contract . In addition , there are costs for different services and charges for buying apps . It all adds up . Calls are also more expensive over mobile networks than over home phones . <p> 5 . There are security risks with smartphones . You store lots of personal information on mobile phones and many of the apps log you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your online accounts . If your phone does not have an adequate , password protected , screen lock , then all this information is at risk . <p> In addition , there is also the risk your phone can be hacked or even spied upon . <p> 6 . Hello , burglar , I ? m on holiday ! There are some apps that allow friends to track your location using your phone and if their phone gets stolen , it ? s easy for the thieves to find out that you are away from home . Of course , you can make it easier for them by posting a photo of you on Facebook , sunning yourself on the beach . <p> 7 . Storage can be a problem . Smartphones are small so there isn ? t space for a huge , built-in hard drive . Although you can buy a sizable SD card for your music , images and videos , the vast majority of your apps and the data they download will be stored on the phone ? s internal storage by default . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , whenever the app updates ( and most do so very regularly ) , it will reinstall everything back on the internal storage again . In effect , this limits the number of apps you can have installed at any one time . <p> 8 . Danger , Water ! Although there are a few waterproof phones beginning to appear on the market , it is safe to say that the vast majority of smartphones don ? t get on too well with liquids . You ? ll be surprised at how many get dropped down the toilet , in the bath or in the sink . If yours gets wet , turn it off or remove the battery as soon as possible to try to prevent it shorting . The most common remedy , though it doesn ? t work for everyone , is to stick it in a bag of rice for 24 hours to soak up any water . Check out the many YouTube videos for help . The best solution is to contact the manufacturer or your vendor . <p> 9 . Smartphones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the biggest problem we tend to have is dropping them and the result is often a smashed screen . Whilst you can buy a replacement screen and have a go at mending it yourself , the results are often poor . Getting it done professionally is the best option but it also very expensive . You can massively reduce the risk of smashing the screen by not lending your phone to your kids . <p> 10 . On a serious note , perhaps the biggest disadvantage of having a smartphone is that you put yourself at risk of someone trying to rob it from you . There have been instances of people being badly assaulted by thieves stealing phones and this is much more likely if you are flashing the latest , must-have phone . Luckily , a new technology which allows stolen phones to be deactivated remotely after being lost or stolen has reduced the number of thefts taking place . The best solution , however , is to keep your phone in your bag or pocket when in public . Out of sight , out of mind .

@@14548711 @3148711/ <h> High Quality Content : The Future of SEO <h> High Quality Content : The Future of SEO <p> If you listen to Matt Cutts , leader of Google 's Webspam Team , you 'll know that high quality content sits right at the top of Google 's list of ranking factors . The reason for this is quite simple : it offers Google users a better user experience . In this article , we 'll explain what is meant by high quality content and how to produce it for your website . <h> What is high quality content ? <p> Essentially , high-quality content is something that does its job well . Every web page has a purpose , such as to inform , entertain , compare or persuade . How well your website does that in relation to other sites writing about the same topic is a critical factor in how well it ranks . <p> Besides purpose , you will also need to ensure your content is right for your audience . If you run a blog about knitting and you want to show your readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for beginners would need different content to a post for more advanced knitters ; for example , you would need to define some of the terms and explain some of the techniques . <p> To create high quality content takes hard work . What you publish needs to be well researched , current and go into more detail than content on other sites . This means it has to be longer , too . According to Backlinko , the average word count needed to get on the first page of Google is now 1890 words " and rising . Thin content no longer cuts the mustard . <h> Why topic coverage is important to website quality <p> Google assesses the quality of your website by looking at the breadth and depth of your content . Its language-based algorithm can understand the topic that you are writing about : it finds your keywords and then looks at the number and frequency of associated topic words in the rest of the text . <p> For example , if you ran a building company and had a page about your loft conversion service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic terms it would expect to see on such a page : planning permission , building control , electrical installation , insulation , etc . The length of the page , the additional media ( images , videos , etc. ) included in the content and the number of associated topic words would all be used to see how relevant your content is . <p> A couple of hundred words giving a brief description and a list of your services would n't rank very highly . A longer page , giving a detailed account of your services and how they benefit the customer would rank higher because Google considers this to offer a better user experience . <h> The importance of organic linking <p> The second way Google judges quality is through organic linking . The word organic is important here because Google believes that other sites will naturally link to high quality content . To rank highly , therefore , your content has to earn links from other websites and if those websites are high quality themselves , the better is it for you . <p> What Google wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is taking part in unethical link schemes . These include paying for links , link exchanging , links in footers or sidebars , large-scale guest posting , optimised anchor text and various other practices . Taking part in these can lead to Google downranking you or even giving you a penalty . <p> Instead , you are looking to get links from reputable websites , shares and links on social media and good reviews " all of which tell Google that people think you have a great website . <h> The implications for SEO <p> Whilst it is still important to optimise your pages for the keywords you want to rank for , you can no longer rely just on this for on-page optimisation . When it comes to creating great content , you now need to ensure that you also optimise with the correct topic words and phrases . <p> In addition , those who have used an SEO company to get them backlinks need to think about their strategy very carefully . A good SEO company 's role , today , is to help you create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who count . In this sense , SEO is all about PR : getting your content liked and shared by social media influencers and linked to from leading blogs and authority websites in your niche . <p> In the future , according to Matt Cutts , even this wo n't be needed . He claims Google is only a few years away from perfecting an algorithm whereby it will no longer need to rely so heavily on backlinks as a way to judge quality . <p> So , what do you need to do to create quality content ? <p> Here 's a checklist for each piece of content you create : <h> 1 . Know the audience for that piece of content <p> Who are they ? What are they searching for ? What information or help do they need ? What 's the best way to present that information to them ? <h> 2 . Know your purpose <p> Why are you creating this content ? What do you want to achieve ? What 's the best way to achieve it ? <h> 3 . Add value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is out there on the internet and does n't just rephrase what is already there . To achieve this , you need to expand or update on things already published or offer something entirely new . <h> 4 . Make sure you use topic words <p> Where relevant , make sure your content includes the topic words and phrases that both readers and search engines would expect to see . For SEO purposes , make sure the important - ones are included in subheadings too . <h> 5 . Make your content accessible to readers <p> If people are going to link to you and share your content it needs to be accessible . Make sure the language is at a level that the intended audience can understand ; use subheadings , bullets , numbered lists and bold to make it easier to access information ; include relevant images and graphics to illustrate your points and link to other , high-quality websites that will be of benefit to your readers . <h> 6 . Cut the fluff <p> Whilst Google is ranking longer content , padding out existing web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to work . Google 's algorithm is more sophisticated than that and your readers would find the content boring . Instead , add more interesting sections to keep them engaged . <h> 7 . Make sure your content is well written <p> High quality content should be technically accurate , coherent and interesting to read . <h> Conclusion <p> From reading this article , you should now have a better understanding of how developments in Google 's algorithm are having an impact on SEO . Google is concentrating much more on quality and organic links and in order to rank highly , these are the areas in which you need to focus with your SEO . <p> Of course , this does n't mean you should neglect important technical SEO factors such as site security , speed and reliability . <p> If you have a business website and are looking for a web host that can help you with security , speed and availability , check out our wide range of business packages . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> 4 Ways to Source Products for Selling Online <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important elements in starting your venture is finding the products you wish to sell .

Its speed and ease make it the ideal way to connect both internally and externally and it can be used for an enormous number of things . Indeed , without email , many businesses would grind to a halt . And because email is so important , it is vital that your business has email hosting which meets the needs today 's marketplace . In this article , we 'll explain exactly what you should look for when choosing an email hosting package . <h> Security <p> Organisations have an obligation to comply with the regulations of the Information Commissioner 's Office and the Data Protection Act . This includes protecting personal data or sensitive information that is sent by email or stored on email servers . For this reason , businesses need to have an email service which will help them maintain compliance with the law . <p> There are a number of things you need to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help prevent data being stolen by hackers , ideally , you want a web host that monitors your email server for intrusion and prevents hackers getting access . To prevent the loss of your emails , whether from hardware failure or accidental deletion , you should also use an email host that offers email backups and secure archiving as part of their packages . With protected archiving , your emails are compressed and encrypted , giving your organisation the security it needs to stay legally compliant . <p> The location of your host 's servers is also another issue which you need to take note of . The insistence of the US Government that it can access data stored on US-based servers , means that UK businesses can not guarantee the privacy of their emails if their host stores them on servers in the USA . In 2015 , the European Court of Justice ruled that EU data stored on US-based servers no longer had adequate protection . - The implication of this for business is that you should be looking for a host that , like eUKhost , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prying eyes of the US security services . <h> Accessibility <p> Modern business is no longer a Monday to Friday , 9 to 5 operation .

A good web host will provide a service that will let you send and receive seamlessly from any device with an internet connection in just a few clicks " wherever , whenever . <p> Ideally , your email hosting should enable you to send and receive emails using Webmail , which can be accessed using any browser , anywhere in the world . You should also have the ability to use your email hosting service with all POP and IMAP compatible software ( e.g. Microsoft Outlook ) and devices . <p> An important aspect to consider here is the hardware your email servers run on . You need email servers that are super-fast to ensure , whatever type of connection your device has , your mail and any attachments can be accessed or sent quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be significant problems for your emails . Spam can clog up your inbox , waste hours of your time and even contain phishing and other threats . Viruses can infect your devices , ransom your data and even use your email accounts to send spam to your contacts . <p> To safeguard your email , you need an email hosting service that offers virus and spam protection as standard , keeping online extortions and vulnerabilities at bay. - For best protection , you should look to see if the host uses SpamExperts- , which automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails against an advanced , self-learning algorithm to eliminate spam e-mail before it reaches your inbox . Spam emails are then quarantined , leaving only genuine emails for you to deal with . <h> Mail Server Blacklist Check <p> A common problem for many businesses is that their mail servers can get blacklisted , especially if they are hosted on a shared server . This can happen if you send suspiciously high volumes of emails or if the emails you send contain some characteristics of spam . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address to another and end up forwarding spam emails as a result " this is because your mail IP address will be seen to relay the spam message to others servers . <p> If your mail server does get onto one of the many blacklists , it will mean that some of your emails- will not be delivered and this could have really negative consequences for your business . For this reason , you need an email host that will proactively check blacklists on a daily basis and , if you are found to be on a list , will submit requests on your behalf to have your server 's IP address removed . Once removed , your host should then investigate why you were blacklisted and apply a fix . <h> Fully-Featured <p> A good email service will offer the full range of features you expect from your email , including contacts , calendars , tasks , briefcases and Outlook integration .

This could cause customers that have shopped happily with you in the past to think twice about using your site . As the only option is to migrate from HTTP to HTTPS , this post will look at the things you will need to consider in order to achieve this . <h> Why is Google warning visitors ? <p> Internet security stories are in the news all the time : cybercrime affects an awful lot of people and it is on the rise .

This new initiative is just the first phase of Google 's long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure ' . <h> What is HTTPS ? <p> HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and is the set of rules used to transfer data from one machine to another across the internet . HTTPS is the secure version of the- HTTP and is generally used on websites where there are financial transactions or where users are required to send personal information . <p> What makes HTTPS secure is encryption .

Google are n't telling lies about the security of HTTP sites . Without using encryption , credit card details , personal information and passwords are all vulnerable to theft whilst being sent from a user 's browser to your server . <p> As the warnings from Google become a common feature of our browsing experience , internet users are going to develop much greater awareness of which sites are safe and which are not .

Page speed is an important ranking factor , so you will be pleased to hear that HTTPS pages load much faster than HTTP giving your customers an improved user experience and boosting the chances of your pages ranking better . <h> Migrating to HTTPS <p> In order to use HTTPS , you will first need to obtain an SSL certificate .

@@14548726 @3148726/ <h> Constant hacking of our EUKHost Linux VSL <p> 25-10-2016 , 14:01 <p> Hello . <p> I am looking for any help or advice that my be offered . <p> For the past three months ago our VSL has suffered from almost continuous hacking attacks resulting in denial of service and in the worst cases intrusions . The attacks appear to take the form or penetration scanning . We think there are multiple scripts being run against numbers of our accounts , attempting to find vulnerabilities . The result of this is that our VSL stuffs up . The hacking attempts take up all resources , such that our sites become unobtainable and we are unable to get to the WHM to reboot the server and so have to call in EUKHost . EUKHost operatives are always very helpful but the chat facility is slow and time consuming ( I suspect the staff are supporting too many issues at the same time ) . Recently many of my evenings have been taken up conversing with Spencer , Magritte , Nikita et al . <p> Sometimes the hackers get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising Canadian pharmacy or sometimes an account will be used to send out spam . <p> We have spent so long dealing with this that we have got to the end of our tethers . EUKHost operatives have been very helpful but it gets to the point when each EUKHost operative tells us to do the same things , blithely unaware that the last one told us to do exactly the same things and that we have done them multiple times already ! And still our server goes down at least twice a day and sometimes we get hacked . So I am writing here in the hope that the EUKhost community may be able to add something new . <p> Almost all out sites are Wordpress . We have secured SSH and WHM to known IP addresses as detailed above . We run ModSecurity , CSF and cPHULK . On each Wordpress site we use all best security practices , inc , keeping everything up to date , only using well known plugins and themes , database table and login page renaming , login capchas , strong passwords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed passwords . On each site we run the Wordpress plugins All In One Security and Wordfence , both set to very high security . <p> With all this going on we are at a loss to see how scanning and penetration attacks can take our server down for up to 20 minutes twice a day . Surely one of the firewalls should recognise the attacks and block the originating IPs ? Why do n't they ? And of course , we can not understand how any of these scripts actually gain access . <p> Any considered help or suggestions would be very much appreciated . Thanks . BTW . We are not Linux experts ( although since taking up a EUKHost VSL I have learnt more than I ever wanted too ! ) <p> There are various factors need to be checked if the server/websites continuously getting hacked . As you said , you have already implemented all possible solutions , I suspect that there might be a culprit account through which php shell getting uploaded to the server . Mostly this is done through plugins or themes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacker access that from browser and creates symlinks or uploads files or executes commands from that console . If you still have an issue with this , please open a support ticket and PM me the ticket I 'd , we will check it and will update you with possible solutions . With wordfence , BulletProof Security plugin will be the best option to secure the wordpress websites.

@@14548737 @3148737/ <p> There was an attack on the host23 server recently . One of the fixes by the EUK server team was to disable plain text email authentication , and enforce mandatory SSL authentication . This was done without any prior announcement , and causes large problems with reseller clients . Most of my clients are set up with plain text authentication . Therefore there 's no way I can contact them all easily to instruct how to reconfigure email , as they can not receive emails . Also the change means having to change the mail servers to host23 as the domain mail servers do n't have SSL certificates . <p> Changes like this need to be pre-warned with a reasonable amount of time to inform clients . I need a grace period where plain text is re-enabled so I can sort my clients out .

However there were no communications to say what had been done , which is bad as it impacts a lot of people who rely on regular email for their business . Given that you send out advertising emails regularly , you need to communicate properly when you impose changes that affect users this way .

The notion of software as a service will be used to replace the ASP ( 2007 ) . <p> The ASP can be considered indirect descendant of " service bureau " of the 1960s and 1970s , in that their primary purpose is to enable clients to practice on outsourcing specific applications , and so enable them to refocus their attention their first jobs .

Only the largest customers can influence on development decisions ; <p> The client must have confidence in its ASP to provide critical information about its work . The ASP is also responsible for business-critical features of its customers . They have no hands on the system in case of malfunction ; <p> Integration with other client systems can be problematic ( recurring problem in computer science ) ; <p> In terms of availability , the supplier must have an availability rate of close to 100% .

Would you not agree that seems somewhat excessive .

@@14548750 @3148750/ <h> Advantages of Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing <h> Advantages of Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing <p> Disaster Recovery plans and infrastructures are a necessity for large enterprises for which operating would be an issue if their mission critical applications were to crash or become unavailable . Most DR infrastructures have adopted the method of replicating the infrastructure and hardware of the primary site at a backup location ; this ensures that when an issue occurs at the primary site , applications can still be served from an unaffected location that contains the necessary capacity . However , replicating an already complex infrastructure is time consuming and costly to not just build , but to maintain too . Cloud DR looks to build upon DR plans by providing a virtualised cloud infrastructure that is able to operate idly with minimal resources , but can scale up to cope with demand when the primary site fails . <h> Reduction in DR costs <p> Moving a DR configuration into the cloud can help you to realise huge cost savings by reducing the amount of physical infrastructure that you need to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disaster that takes down your primary data centre locations . Because a DR environment only requires resources that are of a bare minimum when it is n't being actively used , the amount that you are paying will also be the bare minimum . <p> As a physical DR environment is comprised of hardware and resources that are equal to that of your primary sites , the amount being paid for is often the same as that of the primary site , the only difference being that most of the time these resources are lying idle . So in effect , with traditional DR you could be paying for unused resources a lot of the time . In a cloud DR configuration , if it is called into action then additional resources can be automatically provisioned as the environment scales to cope with the demand being placed on it . Once demand recedes , the resources are then returned to the cloud . With cloud DR you will only ever be paying for resources that are actually being used , which is where the cost efficiencies arise . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity of the DR environment is equal to that of the primary site . So whilst there will be enough capacity to meet demand when the primary site is down , it does mean that even when the DR environment is in use that there could still be a substantial amount of free resources . These are free resources that you will still be paying for . DR in the cloud accounts for this unpredictable demand by scaling up to account for the demand placed on it , so you are only ever paying for resources that are actually being used , therefore there will never be any spare resources . This can also be of assistance for times where demand is actually more than even the primary site can handle . <h> Minimal recovery time <p> With cloud DR , the backup environment will be ready to serve your mission critical applications the moment any issues are detected at your primary sites . In the event that your primary site does become unavailable , your end-users should n't notice any difference as we have designed the failover process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been transferred to the DR environment , you can get to work repairing the primary site as soon as possible to minimise the amount of time that is spent utilising the recovery site . Once you have repaired the issue and are confident that the primary site is ready to be returned to live use , the transfer from the DR site to primary site will also be flawless and completed with minimal downtime . These processes make sure that issues do n't have the opportunity to have a large , negative impact on your business ; although sometimes they may take time and money to repair , from your end-user 's perspective at least your business will continue to operate as normal because they will still be able to access their mission critical applications and data without issue . @qwx190776 @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> What 's on menu ?

Thanks to the amateur actions of the staff I managed to unblock and partially moved my site to the new host on Wednesday night . <p> Since then the server has been taken down and eukhost staff refuse put it online and allow me to only access WHM , CPANEL and SSH to complete all the actions I need to do in order to complete my site move . <p> Trying to forget that the site under attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 days , I think that I do n't not deserve such a treatment specially since I have payed for the server and the least eukhost could do is to allow me to access it to complete my backups . <p> I am waiting for a senior staff member to respond here and finally resolve this issue because in the ticket system I get ridiculous responses and excusses whenever the staff feels like it . <p> We regret the inconvenience caused to you while this entire issue lasted . I have gone through the support ticket concerning this issue and see that we have brought back the server online today as per latest update from Brent . You can SSH to the server and access WHM using the IP address mentioned in the ticket response . <p> As far as restricting the access to the server for last few days is concerned , we have also specified the reason for doing so in the ticket that the attack on your server was an inbound attack . If the server was to be brought back onto the network at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are racked in the same rack . <p> I have escalated this issue to our Level III technicians and you will soon receive an update from one of them either in the ongoing ticket or over here . <h> Comment <p> I have gone through the ticket BHF-960-78689 and noticed that it was inbound attack on the server . Despite tweaking all possible solutions which we can implement , the attack was ongoing and resulted in IP null route many times . Each time our monitoring team updated you about the same . We have tried best to mitigate the attack and only possible solution left was either use Hardware Firewall or CDN services . In ticket , Phil already provided you with the possible solutions . Due to nature of the attack other servers racked in same rack faced network issue so it was not possible for us to keep the server online . <p> Also regarding IP block , you never specified that you were transferring the data to another server by using FTP and while dealing with attack , we noticed heavy no of connections from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and updated you in the ticket itself . <p> As requested by you , your server is back online and accessible now so that you can backup the data and migrate it to another server .

Individually these three dimensions contribute to different areas of corporate IT , looking to simplify the jobs of developers and system administrators , but also reducing the level of support that end-users need . Together they provide a viable and alternative route to providing corporate IT " by investing in Cloud computing , organisations can expect to realise significant cost savings . <p> SaaS " Software as a Service <p> Applications delivered using the SaaS method are generally designed for the use of end-users . As a Cloud application that is hosted externally , SaaS applications are delivered through the web and the processing and hosting of data is handled centrally within the Cloud . Sitting at the top of the stack , SaaS is fundamentally changing the way that we use many popular applications . Updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so users have the assurance that they will always be using the most up-to-date version of their SaaS applications ; this also removes the need for them to install patches on their own accord and reduces the chances of a segmented user base developing where there are a number of different versions of software in wide use . <p> SaaS makes sense because with organsational need for IT increasing all the time , building and maintaining an infrastructure capable of keeping pace with the change will not only be costly , but most like prohibited by the time such tasks take . Improved collaboration will also be result of SaaS implementation and companies can expect to add as many extra users as they require without any impact on the performance or delivery of their service . Billing is most commonly done on a per-user model , meanwhile maintenance and support for the infrastructure is the responsibility of the host ; together these features contribute to a significant reduction in cost . <p> PaaS " Platform as a Service <p> A PaaS environment provides the tools and frameworks that developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creating applications from scratch is a long and arduous process , and PaaS is designed to simplify this and reduce development and deployment times by providing a common set of libraries and frameworks on which developers build their products . We briefly touched on how Cloud computing can be an enabler of collaboration within the organisation ; this idea is developed further with PaaS as such an environment gives developers the resources and tools they need to work on the same project at the same time so that multiple people can contribute to getting the task completed quicker and more efficiently . <p> The core purpose for using PaaS applications is to create what we see at the top of the stack , those user-friendly , frontend SaaS applications . <p> IaaS " Infrastructure as a Service <p> At the bottom of the stack is IaaS , or Infrastructure as a Service . In layman 's terms , IaaS can be defined as the main resources that make up your average corporate IT environment " servers , storage , networking components , and operating systems " delivered through a Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The IaaS dimension of Cloud computing can help organisations to realise cost savings through the divestment of physical hardware and the investment in basic Cloud resources that are representative of what the business requires on an average day . Physical hardware is costly to maintain , suffers from significant depreciation , and can be hard to upgrade to cope with additional loads without incurring downtime . The move to an IaaS platform provides a dynamic and scalable environment where an organisation can request extra resources when it needs them . Simply put , scalability is incorporated from the ground up . Within the stack IaaS provides the resources that sustain the development platforms and production platforms for the PaaS and SaaS dimensions . <p> In some cases it is important to recognise that there may be some corporate elements that need to remain in-house for legal and regulatory purposes , such as storage for sensitive data , but for the most part IaaS can provide a sufficient alternative to your existing infrastructure , will be respectful of your needs , all the while reducing your costs . <p> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain that Cloud computing is n't just a single thing , or one topic " it can be readily split into three different levels , each of which are made up of many constituents themselves .

As far as the client is concerned , he has to use a Web browser like Internet explorer , Mozilla , Netscape , etc . On the server side , a variety of softwares is available . What type of server software you are able to run depends on the Operating System chosen for the server . <p> For example , Microsoft Internet Information Server is a popular choice for Windows NT , while those who prefer Unix choose Apache Web server . <p> The communication between the client machine and the Web server transpires as follows : <p> 1 .

Virtualization , SaaS , PaaS , IaaS , how you navigate ? <p> Here is an overview of the forms of " services " that we declined twofold . <h> Virtualisation is the genesis of cloud , <p> To understand the cloud , we must go back to its origin : Virtualisation . <p> Historically , computer systems were installed on servers , kind of powerful computers that were manufactured to be installed in special shelters called Datacentres . <p> In the beginning the physical server works on a thumb rule : an application , an operating system , a server hardware . But now , experts have found a physical server , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its total capacity . So 80% to 85% of capacity of a machine were thrown into the dustbin ! <p> Meanwhile , the server continues to cost 100% in maintenance costs and energy consumption . To this must be added the cumbersome procedures : any additional memory or disk space required intervention directly on the hardware , which stopped working during this time . It was neither optimized nor environmentally friendly . In some cases , choose a physical server was a bit like flying alone on a plane with more than 200 seats ! <p> What if we could optimize the use of resources of a machine ( CPU , memory , storage , network ) in order to make the investment profitable by not deploying a single operation and more than one application system ? You immediately enter the primary interest of virtualization , you are good managers ! <p> The term " virtualisation " is pretty self explanatory : this technique is to virtualizing which is in physical form . We are not talking here to the physical element disappear completely , but rather to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch from using a scooter ( only you enjoy the machine to move ) to that of an SUV with eight seats , in which everyone takes advantage of its power . So , you work eight times harder ! <p> This transformation is performed by means of a software layer installed on the physical machine called " hypervisor . " With this hypervisor , it is possible to create multiple virtual servers within a single physical server . These servers are called " virtual machines " ( VM ) simultaneously share the physical server capacity or the physical machine on which they are installed . <p> The " VM " is created and fed , just like a physical server , processing power , memory , storage space and shared network . Depending on the need , you can add or reduce the resources within the limits of the capacity of the physical host machine . <p> Virtualization technologies have subsequently improved to provide more availability , fault tolerance and capacity for daily operations . For example , a major step was to ask the application data not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage hardware . What is the point ? This allowed for maintenance of physical servers all operations without interrupting services running on it , improve data access and availability of applications on performance VM . <p> This equates to passing my eight-passenger SUV in a pickup service class of a company vehicle rental . If a minivan is not working , it takes another to pick you up and you do not see about anything , everything goes . And if the physical server crashes , then the VM can quickly get back on another physical server , since the data have been always available and independent . here 's how the virtual infrastructure has spread . Consolidation , performance and flexibility are the key factors . <p> Cloud computing can be accessed via the Internet using different virtualised network resources ( virtual server , disk space , network , software ) .

The data addresses are called virtual since these data can be stored in main memory in a completely different physical address , or be stored in mass memory .

Load balanced servers ensure that no single server is overcome by extra load thus the data is available to all the users at one single time . <p> To setup a load balanced network , high configuration dedicated servers are deployed in a network administered by a load balancer to distribute the traffic . <p> Network load balanced servers are usually deployed by large companies and organisations with complex business processes and thousands of customers who access the servers at any given single time . - News websites , video streaming websites and social networking websites are some examples where a load balanced setup would be typically used given the amount of data and traffic on the servers . <p> Businesses maintaining a large network of servers to accommodate their large corporate data also require a load balanced infrastructure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual server 's processing power is used optimally and intelligently . An advanced load balanced setup directs user requests to the servers that have the least load thus ensuring the fastest response times . <p> Load balancing ensures a resilient , highly available network with fault tolerance because of one server in the network goes down ; the requests on that server are handled by the next in line server in the cluster . With high availability , reliability is achieved as there is no effect on speed or performance even if one server in the network goes down . Similarly , if an application on one server fails , it will remain available from the next server in the network . <p> This has another advantage in the case of planned maintenance . The entire network need not go down or offline for software or hardware maintenance .

In this article , we 'll discuss the main types of web hosting available so that you can make an informed choice about which is best for you . <h> What are web hosts ? <p> In order for your website to be on the internet , it has to be stored on a web server ; a powerful computer with software that serves your web pages to users around the world who have requested to see them . A web host is a company that provides the servers on which you store your WordPress software and all your website data . - They also provide a wider range of services to help you manage your website , keep it safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for the moment <p> When it comes to choosing a web hosting package , one of the biggest mistakes many WordPress users make is to think of it as an overhead that should be got at the cheapest available price . It is n't . You should look at web hosting as an investment in your online business infrastructure that can have a real effect on your profitability . <p> Your first priority should be to look at the features of each type of hosting and assess which of these is most appropriate for your business ' needs . It is also advisable to take a long-term perspective . What do you need now ? What might you need two or three years down the line ? Only when you know what you need should you consider the pricing . <h> Types of Hosting <p> There are four main types of WordPress hosting available : shared , VPS , dedicated and cloud hosting . Here we 'll give you an understanding of each . <h> Shared hosting <p> The best way to understand shared hosting is to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate business : you have your own space but have to share all the resources with the other companies . With shared hosting , your website leases out part of server whilst the rest is used to house other websites . It is by far the most popular hosting option because sharing the CPU ( processors ) , memory and disk space makes it less expensive . <p> Shared hosting works perfectly well for the vast majority of the world 's WordPress websites ; it provides adequate speed , storage , bandwidth and reliability for them to function without problems . However , for the server 's resources to be shared fairly , web hosts do need to put limits on some features . As a result , there may be limitations on storage space or the number of files you can upload , which can be a problem for very large e-commerce sites with lots of product images " especially as WordPress makes multiple copies of each image which you upload. - There can also be a limit to the number of websites , databases ( you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can create . Some hosts may restrict your bandwidth , too , in a similar way that broadband companies do with their fair use policies , which could limit the number of visitors who can access your website at any one time . <p> The usage requirements for most websites will be well within the limits set by web hosts and this makes shared hosting ideal for small to medium sized websites that do n't require processor heavy software or do n't have exceptionally large amounts of traffic . However , if you think your business will outgrow shared hosting , you will need to consider the other options available . <h> VPS Hosting <p> If shared hosting is too limited for your needs , the next step up is VPS hosting . VPS stands for Virtual Private Server . Web hosts create a VPS by partitioning a physical server is into several smaller virtual servers . The difference between VPS and shared hosting is that each virtual server is completely independent of the others on the physical server . As a result , your WordPress website will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be affected by other websites . <p> The other advantage to VPS hosting , is that it offers the freedom to host unlimited domains , install custom applications and software and make changes to the server settings . This is usually not allowed on shared hosting because these changes could affect all the other customers sharing the server . <p> Being able to make changes to the server settings can be important to some WordPress users , especially if you want to import large amounts of data , such as if you run an online shop and need to update your wholesaler 's stock details using cron-jobs . Some hosts put limits on shared servers which can cause these automated processes to time out , resulting in inaccurate prices or unavailable products being for sale on your store . This wo n't happen with VPS hosting . <p> Virtual Personal Server hosting is ideal for SME 's and bloggers with high-traffic websites ; small to medium e-commerce sites ; small membership sites and school virtual learning networks . It 's also useful for companies that run more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of email addresses and user accounts . <h> Dedicated Hosting <p> With this form of hosting , the use of the entire physical server is dedicated to your business . The capacity of the resources available from a dedicated server gives you the potential to host enormous , high-traffic websites , including those which need processor hungry apps in order to run . Dedicated hosting is the best choice for large e-commerce businesses that have thousands of visitors simultaneously searching your database for products . It will allow you to store large quantities of data and have the processing power to cope with significant volumes of queries . <p> A dedicated server allows total control over the server settings and let 's you choose the most appropriate operating system and software . Importantly , as all the resources on the server are dedicated to you , it makes hosting far more reliable even when you are exceptionally busy . <h> Cloud Hosting <p> Cloud hosting is where your website and the resources needed to run it are stored across a cluster of different servers . This gives it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a dedicated server goes down , it will take- time- to restore your website onto another server and this will result in downtime when your site is offline . With cloud hosting , if one server goes down , it does n't matter as the others in the network are still running ; as a result , there is no downtime . <p> The second major advantage is its scalability . With several servers working for you at one time , should your website be exceptionally busy , you can utilise the power of all those servers to boost memory , processing and bandwidth . - If your business grows , you can scale up on a permanent basis or if something goes viral and you need short term capacity to keep up with demand , cloud hosting could be the choice for you . <h> Managed Hosting <p> One of the main advantages of WordPress is that it is easy for a non-IT specialist to use . As a content management system ( CMS ) , it allows businesses to focus more on the front end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this in mind , it is best to know that there are some specialised IT skills needed if you want to manage your own server . This does n't apply to shared hosting , but it does apply to VPS , dedicated and cloud hosting . If you need these types of hosting and terms like PHP , MySQL and Linux mean nothing to you , then the sensible choice is to leave it to the professionals and opt for managed hosting . With managed hosting , all the technical aspects of configuring , running and maintaining the server are taken care of by your web host leaving you to dedicate your time to the website itself .

How would you be alerted about the approaching expiry ? Incase you have n't laden specific plans about managing the expired or the expiring API keys , it can result in chaos upon expiry of the passwords . <p> D ) Secure and Encrypted File Storage : Many-a-times it may so happen that the developer implements their own security for API keys , this might sometimes be a gamble .

The firewall is a shield of material resistant to fire that is placed between a potential fire and the people it is protecting . <p> Firewalls can be constructed in quite a variety of ways .

That sounds interesting . <p> First off , you will need to create a MySQL database through your cPanel account . Afetr that , set your Dreamweaver website hosting up with a testing server ( just enter a bunch of fake stuff ) which will then allow you to use the ' application ' extension on the right hand panel of the program . You will first off need to create a connection to the database , Dreamweaver will do this for you , you just need to have all the necessary stuff like address of the server , database name and database login details . If you enter that stuff Dreamweaver will create a connection string file and automatically include it in the page you want ( calendar page in your case ) . You will then need to create a recordset with Dreamweaver , then once that has been created you will be able to create forms , and then use the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code which will add the stuff do the database . Dreamweaver will also code you other stuff like updating a database , deleting database records and even build you a user authentication system . <p> If you want even more functionality you can by the Adobe CS3 Developer Toolbox for DW CS3 which has even more advanved features . <h> Comment <p> As a newcomer you may find it easier to install a CMS through fantastico and copy the contents of your current website hosting onto that - it takes a lot of the need for technical knowledge away and can be quite effective as well as look good once you get it up and running . Also you can get things such as extra modules / patches to add even more functionality to them without having to know a great deal technically about the product / databases etc.

ORValidation of viewstate MAC failed . If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster , ensure that &lt;machineKey&gt; configuration specifies the same validationKey &amp; validation algorithm . AutoGenerate can not be used in a cluster . <p> You 'd be astonished if you 'd get this weird error all of a sudden on a working ASP.Net web application , I was This error infact is a bug in the ASP.Net Framework which has troubled most of the web development masses ! <p> Viewstate usually represents the state of the page when it was last successfully processed / executed on the server .. The contents of the page are stored in a container &amp; moved to &amp; from the server on each request . By default , ASP.NET validates the contents of viewstate to ensure that it has not been tampered . If this validation test fails , an invalid viewstate exception is thrown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web application when using forms or rather a postback method or from the feature called Event Validation .. When you postback before the EventValidation field has been rendered , this will throw the exception . If EventValidation is enabled ( it is by default ) , but ASP.net does n't see the hidden field when you postback , you also get the exception ... If you submit a form before it has been entirely rendered , then chances are the EventValidation field has not yet been rendered , &amp; thus ASP.net can not validate your click &amp; throws the error . This is a security feature that ensures that postback actions only come from events allowed &amp; created by the server to help prevent spoofed postbacks .. This feature is implemented by having controls register valid events when they render . The end result is that at the bottom of your rendered &lt;form&gt; tag , you 'll see something like this : <p> When a postback occurs , ASP.net uses the values stored in this hidden field to ensure that the button you clicked invokes a valid event .. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been seeing all along ... <p> There are a few ways to avoid MAC mismatch mishaps : <p> Do n't use the ViewState if you do n't need to . Not only will it avoid the whole MAC issue , but your pages will run faster to boot .. <p> Turn off MAC generation by setting enableViewStateMac=false in the page or web.config .. This is n't recommended , since the MAC helps prevent people from tampering with your viewstate data . But if tampering with viewstate data is n't a concern ( &amp; it may not be for some applications where there 's no risk of fraud or security breaches ) , you can turn it off . <p> Prevent your application pool from restarting by disabling the auto recycle &amp; idle timeout settings in the application pool . This is n't a 100% guarantee that the pool wo n't restart , but it does help ... <p> Hard-code the MAC validation key so that it 's always the same . I recommend this approach for web farms &amp;/or if your application pool keep restarting for whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biggest risk is now your key is hard-coded in a file , so you need to make sure your server is secure so that people do n't get that key ( otherwise they could hack your viewstate ) . You can hardcode the key in the &lt;machineKey&gt; tag in the machine.config or web.config , like this : <p> Server Farms or Server Clusters : Applications running in a server cluster must have all the machineKey configurations set to the same validationKey . The default AutoGenerate key can not be used in a cluster environment . The registry keys responsible for auto generation of these values are listed here : <p> When the machineKey is set to AutoGenerate , the key information is stored in the HKEYCURRENTUSER hive for the account running the process . For W2k3 servers , this is the Network Service account .. Otherwise , the account is ASP.NET machine account . When the process launches , ASP.NET will use the HKEYCURRENTUSER registry key if it is available . If this key is not available , the HKEYLOCALMACHINE key will be used . If neither registry key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive . If these conditions fail , the process creates a brand new set of keys ... <p> When the application pool is running under a user account , the above keys are not generated leading to an intermittent invalid viewstate error . <p> The workaround is to use a specific key in the machine.config to prevent automatic key generation on each process start . The key must be exactly 128 bits made up of random characters &amp; inserted into the configuration file on each web server experiencing the problem . <p> Form Posts : Viewstate can only be posted back to the same page . Attempting to post an aspx form to another page will fail with a viewstate invalid exception . This behavior is by design . <p> The remedy involves into disabling the Machine Authentication Check , unless you implement a back up authentication mechanism , you should refrain from this approach . Machine Authentication Checks are important in reducing the attack surface of ASP.NET applications as described above . You have to be aware of the security implications . Alternatively , just never post back before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the application pools so that recycling is less likely to occur at peak periods . <p> Use a specific key in the machine.config to prevent automatic key generation on each process start . <p> Only post to the same ASPX page . <p> You can disable the UI until the form has rendered , it can be done in the following way : <p> Including this tag in the header of your page disables the use of the page until it has completely downloaded to the user 's browser . This also reduces the " flicker " effect that occurs on postbacks .. <p> Unfortunately there 's no " perfect " solution for this error as yet . Disabling the enableViewStateMac is ok but in addition to this solution you must store the ViewState somewhere else i.e. Session , Cache so that it wo n't get transmitted to the browser &amp; get played around . The best way is to not use critical information in viewstate or not use components which use viewstate for saving their data . If you need dynamic queries build them every time page refreshes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store the session/cached data &amp; to maintain sessions on a server farm .. <p> You can also create a new BasePage Class that over rides the html Rendering to ensure the EVENTVALIDATION and VIEWSTATEENCRYPTED etc are rendered at the top of the page . This way the viewstate hidden fields are rendered first before any other controls . Therefore , it minimises the chances of the encrypted viewstate not being available .

These new features include : <p> shared configuration with the use of this feature you are able to create one configuration file for your web server which can then be used across a whole farm of IIS 7 web servers , which will help make it easier to manage large deployments of Windows Server 2008 based web server since they will all share the same configuration options <p> automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIS 7 you will find that an application pool for the website concerned is automatically created meaning that no 2 websites will have to share the same application pool on your IIS 7 web server- you can make use of this feature to test websites before putting them into a live environment since if they have their own application pool , they are unlikely to affect the performance of other hosted websites <p> built-in FastCGI support for dynamic languages in order to increase the performance and reliability of third-party dynamic languages on the IIS 7 web server , Microsoft has incorporated the use of FastCGI which will mean that dynamic server side languages such as PHP and Perl can be used with the web server as was previously possible but will be much more reliable and easier to incorporate this time around <p> improved FTP service for the past few versions of IIS , Microsoft has incorporated its FTP service into the application - with the release of version 7 comes an improved FTP service capable of handling more requests than was previouls possible . <p> Advantages of Using IIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over previous versions of IIS . Since you are likely to be using Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista in order to have access to IIS 7 , you will find that you are able to get the latest security updates from Microsoft which will ensure that your Windows based computer or server is secure against hackers and other malicious attackers who may otherwise try and gain access to your server . When using IIS 7 you are likely to notice a performance increase since it is able to render pages more quickly to visitors web browsers , which in turn will ensure that your customers are fully satisfied with the loading times of their websites ; there is also the likelihood that you as a web hosting provider will be using high end dedicated servers for your Windows Server 2008 web hosting services which is likely to have an affect on page loading times . Whether you are a customer of web hosting provider , you are to notice advantages of using IIS 7 . The main advantages that you may find on both sides of the line may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows web developer , you may find it beneficial to have a web hosting account which is using IIS 7 as it will mean that you can make use of your web hosting account for the hosting of classic ASP and ASP.NET web pages and scripts that are n't  able to run on other web hosting services such as Linux web hosting packages since both are Microsoft technologies this also means that you can make use of other Microsoft technologies to help you create a dynamic website for use with IIS 7 such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access <p> easier to use interface if you are using IIS 7 on a VPS server or dedicated server then you will find that the administration interface is much easier to use than that of IIS 6 since Microsoft have paid particular attention to the graphics used as well as how easy it is to change certain settings for the web server as and when needed this in theory means that you neednt have much technical knowledge in order to manage an IIS 7 web server due to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel where everything is explained to you <p> modular architecture the modular architecture deployed in IIS 7 allows you to add new modules to the management interface as you wish to enable you to extend the functionality of Microsofts web server software many new features can be added to IIS 7 with the use of its new modular architecture , although existing features from previous versions such as the SMTP mail component and the web service extension manager come as part of IIS 7 and should be able to provide you with the features that you need to build a flexible and dynamic website . <p> Such advantages of using IIS 7 mean that you can host your dynamic websites in a reliable and secure environment that is flexible enough to meet your needs . As a web hosting provider you will be able to offer your Windows web hosting clients a faster service since IIS 7 will be able to serve their web pages to visitors quicker than IIS 6 or any other previous versions are able to ; however , as a provider you may already be upgrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Disadvantages of the New IIS 7 Features <p> Although the new features provided by IIS 7 may provide web hosts with a good reason to update their Windows web hosting servers to Windows Server 2008 , some- people may find that their websites may not function correctly with the new features and services that are on offer or that system administrators are n't  able to get to grips with using the new IIS 7 management interface . However , the performance increase that IIS 7 is able to offer both web hosting companies and those with their own Windows Server 2008 servers outweighs the disadvantages that you may face , and as long as you find that you can manage IIS 7 correctly then you will see it as the best software upgrade that you 've ever made . As a consumer or web hosting provider , you may find that IIS 7 could affect you with the following disadvantages : <p> compability issues the new features offered by IIS 7 could affect the way in which dynamic websites work on the servers that you are using which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need if your website or the websites that you host do n't  function correctly because of IIS 7 i.e. if you are using FastCGI for the installation of PHP that you have on your Windows Server 2008 then you may find that any PHP based websites that you are hosting may not function correctly to begin with , although this is unlikely <p> confusing interface although Microsoft has tried to make the new IIS 7 management interface more eaiser on the eye and intuitive to use , it may still be confusing for some since there are still many different things that you can change and alter using the management panel however , if you know your way around the IIS 7 panel and understand what the different configuration options do then you should find managing IIS 7 much easier than you found managing an IIS 6 server for Windows Server 2003 server for that matter . <p> In conclusion , the new features offered by IIS 7 are able to offer you as a system administrator the ability to manage your IIS 7 web servers with more easy allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIS 7 servers ; as a consumer you will find that web hosting providers are able to offer you more reliable Windows web hosting services that utilize more dynamic server side scripting languages .

According to the OSI model , the various existing protocols are divided into seven levels , where a protocol for a given level can be combined with any protocol levels located above and below ( see encapsulation ) . <p> An operating system typically contains several programs to exchange information in various protocols of levels 1-4 . While levels 5-7 are supported by application software and middleware . <p> To exchange information according to protocols of Level 1 and 2 , the operating system requests the operation of computer hardware through a pilot computer pilot who can be part of the system operation or be provided by the manufacturer of the equipment . <p> When sending information over the network , application software creates information , which is formatted according to the protocols of levels 7-5 , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operating system will cut the information into frames , then go to format and send frames according to the protocols of levels 4-1 . <p> Upon receipt of frames from the network , different programs of the operating system will attempt to decode them according to various protocols at 1-4 , and then convert the following frames in a continuous stream , which will be sent to the recipient software application . The software will then decode the stream according to the protocols of levels 5-7 . The application software performs before a connection , that is to say , a logical link through which it will associate with a particular feed . <p> The exact choice of protocols depends on the affected computer and network links that will be used . Various configuration parameters can influence the choice of protocols .

The operating system then prepares a list of permitted and prohibited transactions with the user according to the regulations ( also called policies ) which have been introduced by the security administrator the person responsible for information security . <p> During each operation requested by an application software , the operating system must first check if the user manipulates the software application is authorized to perform this operation . The verification is done on the basis of regulations and lists of access rights introduced by the security administrator .

@@14548852 @3148852/ <h> Choosing between MS-Access , MSSQL or MySQL databases ! <p> Now that you 've designed a database driven website hosting , you 'd need a database to save data or query/fetch certain records . How flexible do you need your data to be ? How secure must your data be ? Do you need support in utilizing your data management tools ? These are all questions that you will have to answer for yourself . And in answering them , you will know which data management tool will be best suited for your personal , business or corporate needs . Here 's a bit of most common differences or rather a check-guide on whether to use Microsoft Access , MySQL or MSSQL database Server for a website hosting : <p> MS Access : There are some very good reasons why you would n't use this type of database in some cases . MS Access database is more suitable for desktop use with a small number of users accessing it simultaneously . One reason you might choose to use Microsoft Access over SQL Server is for compatibility/sharing . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People are more likely to have Access on their desktop computer than SQL Server . You 'll generally only find SQL Server on developers ' computers/servers or on production server machines . Another reason you might use MS Access instead of SQL Server is money . You might already have installed Microsoft Access as part of the Microsoft Office suite . Purchasing SQL Server would be an extra expense that may not be necessary - depending on your situation . SQL Server can also be quite expensive . To add futher , Access is used as local database &amp; ca n't be accessed through other servers or rather from any remote location . In short it has a front-end GUI system MS-Office to design applications quickly but locally . You can also design/modify the Access database on your local machine &amp; upload it to the web server where the web site hosting exists , but this becomes a tiresome job when the DB size increases gradually . <p> When it comes to security , MS Access is limited to security in terms of username/password on the database . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ( as well as the folder it resides in ) . Typically , ASP applications must allow the anonymous Internet guest account ( IUSR&lt;machineName&gt; ) to have read/write permissions on file and folder . Username/Password access to the database can not be controlled with any more granularity . <p> Microsoft Access is mostly used &amp; rather made for novices in DB programming . MySQL/MSSQL are for non-novice , more professional , kind of people . Actually MSAccess is introduced by Microsoft for the small offices who want to have a small DB of employees , etc . As you put more &amp; more data into the access file , the performance of the application reduces hence making the data retrieval process takes longer &amp; longer ... <p> MS SQL Server : MS SQL Server is a server based database &amp; is a more robust database management system . It was designed to have many hundreds , or even thousands of users accessing it at any point in time . Microsoft Access on the other hand , does n't handle this type of load very well . This makes SQL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never use MS Access for a database driven website - unless it has a very small amount of traffic . Even then , you may find yourself getting errors due to multiple users trying to access the database at the same time . There is no front-end GUI system so it will require other development tools ( Visual Studios , . NET , VB , C++ , etc .. etc ... ) <p> SQL Server has two authentication modes , and neither are much like Microsoft Access security at all . You can use Windows Authentication , which allows you direct access to domain Users and Groups from within the interface . You can also use Mixed Mode , which allows MSSQL Server to maintain usernames and passwords ( thereby negating the need for a domain or other Windows user/group maintenance ) . Once you have determined an authentication mode , users have three different levels of access into the database : login ( at the server level ) , user ( at the database level ) , and object permissions within each database ( for tables , views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer of complexity , MSSQL Server makes it easy to &amp;quot ; clone&amp;quot ; users by defining server-wide roles , and adding users to that role . This is much like a Group in a Windows domain ; in MSSQL Server , you can use the built-in definitions ( and customize them ) , or create your own . Alterations to a role 's permissions affect all users that are members of that role . <p> If you are using MS Access database , you wo n't be able to connect to it from another machine/server without mapping the drive . But in the case of MySQL or MSSQL you can have the database server in HongKong &amp; the application using it being run from the UK &amp; that is the major difference . The main draw back of the MSAccess DB is that it is a single file &amp; if the file is corrupted , you 'd be in serious trouble &amp; as the file can not hold enormous amounts of data , its not possible to take differential backups of the same . <p> MySQL : Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other RDBMS software : <p> MySQL has multiple storage engines , which allows you to choose the one which is most effective for each table in the application : In MySQL 5.0 or earlier , storage engines used to be compiled in while in MySQL 5.1 , storage engines can be dynamically loaded at run time : <p> MySQL is the most famous or rather more loved amongst the professional folks because of it 's multiple choice in custom storage engines . You can have custom storage engines developed in MySQL based on your requirements or choose amongst the inbuilt ones . The most commom native storage engines include MyISAM , Falcon , Merge , Memory ( heap ) , Federated , Archive , CSV , Blackhole , Cluster , BDB , EXAMPLE &amp; Maria which are developed by MYSQL developers themselves . While InnoDB , solidDB , NitroEDB , BrightHouse are examples of partner-developed storage engines . There are several communities all over the world developing into MySQL to create their customized storage engines , such storage engines are termed as community-developed storage engines , examples of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to commit grouping , gathering multiple transactions from multiple connections together to increase the number of commits per second . <p> Comparing between MSSQL &amp; MySQL for performance is a bit difficult task The database provider does n't really play a key role in the performance factor in between these two database types but it 's the experience of the database developers &amp; DBA which make it perform better than each other . You can use both of these RDBMS to build a stable &amp; an efficient system . <p> However , it is possible to define the typical transactions , which used in inventory control systems , airline reservation systems &amp; banking systems . After defining these typical transactions , it is possible to run them under the different database management systems working on the different hardware &amp; software platforms . <p> From a database developer 's point-of-view , the choice is very clear . MSSQL Server or MySQL Database Server Hosting are the most sensible choices because of its rich features in manipulating , securing and managing data . Also , from a developer 's stand point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features mean that development of an application to interface with the database will be both more costly and take longer to finalize . Too much code must be written in the user interface to manipulate the data first , before sending that data to the database . All this extra code costs time and money to develop and maintain . You need to make the decision in choosing the appropriate database based on your website hosting 's requirement . If you do think you need to upgrade to SQL Server , there are several tools available all over the internet to get this transformation done quickly &amp; flawlessly . Finally the decision is yours ... <p> I would just add that with Microsoft producing the SQL Server Express edition as a free download/install there are even fewer reasons to use an Access DB ( especially on a server ) on anything other than a single-user system . <p> The performance , security and occasional corruption issues associated with Access DBs can cause major headaches ! <h> Comment <p> Thanks Rock - a useful summary ( I 'm just asking myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting ( PreservedTanks.com ) that gives information on preserved tanks around the world with information , photographs and ( where available ) a Google position of each tank - e.g. in a museum , a relic on a battlefield , a monument in a town centre , etc .

In other words , the bandwidth is the web traffic or the transfer of data that is allowed to take place between your website and the rest of the internet . <p> When you have your own website and want to make it accessible for the people on the internet , you need a web hosting server which suits your business . It is important to have a good bandwidth when you choose any type of a web hosting server plan . Today , there are many web hosting companies present on the internet that are offering their services for different rates . <p> The total bandwidth that you can get from your web host depends on the type of scheme that you choose and on the web host 's internal and external network connections . <p> You just have to research well before getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through various websites related to the web hosting service on the internet , search their forums , blogs , and other discussion pages . You can even contact the present customers of that particular web hosting company and find out various important things like the quality of the service offered , the softwares and other web tools that are offered by that web hosting company . <p> The web hosting directory is the best place to find out the various web hosting companies that are present on the internet . The web hosting directories even help you to know every statistics about a particular web hosting company . Through , the web hosting directories you can even compare the different schemes of different web hosting company and then choose the best out of the lot that suits you website and your business . <p> Also , you will find many web hosting companies that offer unlimited bandwidth . I think , and logically too , this is not possible . Even if some web host offered you unlimited bandwidth , that host would face difficulties and will close shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of the web hosting company that you are planning to get registered for . Sometimes , some web hosting companies can easily cheat you by changing their terms and conditions , asking you to pay some extra money for using their services or else lose the entire website that is present on their web hosting server . Also , check whether the web host can instantaneously provide you extra bandwidth for the same cost if you are in need of it somewhere in near future . <p> Also , it is extremely important to check the requirements of your own website . You need to see the type of content that is present on your website . If you do not check the requirements of your website while selecting your web hosting plan , there are chances that you select a plan that has very few features to suit your huge website . Or , similarly , you may opt for a web hosting plan that has features that are absolutely unusable by your website . So , learn what the needs of your planned website are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present and soon . <p> You even need to check if any particular web page in your entire website contains very heavy data . Also , check whether your website contains heavy content like pretty heavy graphics , animations , audios , videos , heavy downloads and other things which needs pretty heavy bandwidth . Multimedia files are quite huge , and their transmission over the internet is also very slow . These multimedia files need the most bandwidth . You will need heavy bandwidth if you are targeting and are successful in getting great amount of web traffic to your website . <p> This is because , if you are getting a lot of web traffic to your website , then there are possibilities that many online visitors are viewing the same web page which contains heavy data or even at times many online visitors are downloading some huge files present on your website . All these activities require a lot of bandwidth . If you do not have sufficient bandwidth and if suddenly get lots of online visitors then it may seriously affect your website . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , you may have to pay your web host a lot of penalties . If a problem like these occurs very often , then your web host can charge you a lot of money for crossing the allotted resources and sometimes even cancel your service without prior notice . <p> Your website can go extremely slow or may even face downtime and other related problems . If any online visitor is downloading some content , then even the downloading process will be affected and may go slow . If your website faces such problems frequent , then there are huge chances that the online visitors are likely to go away from your website and also never return . This way due to the lack of sufficient bandwidth , you will not only lose the online visitors but also lose the business that you could have made if you had given enough attention to the importance of bandwidth . <p> Check how much bandwidth your website uses . It is easy to do this with the help of cPanel . Watching your bandwidth usage will also enable you to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch and are expecting bursts of increased web traffic , you must have the right amount of bandwidth . <p> If your allocated bandwidth gets over during a product launch , then your targeted traffic will not be able to open your website because no bandwidth will also halt your websites online exposure .

@@14548876 @3148876/ <h> Different Web Hosting Types : A Detailed Guide <h> Different Web Hosting Types : A Detailed Guide <p> If you are about to launch a new website , you may be bewildered by the different types of web hosting that you can choose from . There 's shared , VPS , dedicated and cloud hosting , plus other , specialised types , like dedicated WordPress hosting . At the same time , you may also have a choice between Linux and Windows hosting , which makes the decision even more difficult to make . In this post , we 'll explain what the different types of hosting are so that you can make a more informed choice of which is best for you . <h> What is shared hosting ? <p> Shared hosting is enabled by dividing up the storage space on a web server and allocating sections to different users to host their websites . You can think of it as renting out a small office in a giant office block . Depending upon the type of server used and the policies of different web hosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from 30 to several hundred . <p> Besides sharing the storage space , users also share the servers ' resources , e.g. it 's memory and processing power . The good news , financially , is that running and maintaining costs are also shared , and this is what makes shared hosting the cheapest form of hosting you can buy . <p> Shared hosting is the most popular form and works perfectly well for most websites . Most hosting companies make sure that servers are not overloaded so that no matter how busy all the different websites are on that server , there will be the capacity to keep them all running . <p> To make sure sharing works efficiently , there are often restrictions on what you can do on a shared server . These include limits on the number of websites you can host and the storage space you can use . Some web hosts also restrict bandwidth , the amount of information you can send to users in any billing cycle , which can be a problem if you have lots of visitors . <p> Shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a website that is likely to experience heavy traffic ; need to run high-performing applications from your server ; or need to configure your server in a particular way , then you need to look at alternative hosting solutions . <p> Besides hosting your website , most shared hosting accounts also provide you with email hosting and there is often a range of other useful services , such as enhanced security and website backups , that can also be included or added on to your package . <h> What is a Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) ? <p> VPS is a type of hosting solution that combines the best features of both shared and dedicated hosting . Like shared hosting , there is a physical server whose resources are divided up between account holders , enabling it to be a low-cost solution . However , that 's pretty much where the similarity ends . <p> What makes VPS different is that , rather than getting an allocation of storage space on a single server , the host creates each user their own virtual server . A VPS user , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , memory and processing resources , just as they would with a dedicated server . Whilst this is on a smaller scale than with a dedicated server , it is significantly more than you get on shared hosting . <p> The advantage over shared hosting is that , as each VPS is a self-contained computing environment , your site 's performance ca n't be affected when other sites are busy and your data wo n't be put at risk if the other accounts on the physical server are vulnerable . It also means you can configure the virtual server in the most appropriate way for your business and run custom applications . <p> VPS also gives you the option for fully managed hosting , full administrative access and remote server access . Importantly , the virtual nature of VPS makes it one of the best types of hosting for quick recovery in the case of a server failure or other disaster , which is vital for businesses that need to keep their websites and critical applications available . <p> Services such as email are included in many packages , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated hosting ? <p> When you opt for dedicated hosting you are choosing to use a full server entirely for your own use . With the kinds of servers available today , this gives you exceptional performance as well as bags of storage space to run your website or apps . However , whilst some companies need these types of servers , for many smaller companies it can be akin to buying a double decker bus to drop your kids off at school . <p> As a dedicated server is entirely for your use , you have a great deal of freedom with what you can do with it . In this sense , it can be tailored to your specific needs . You can configure the server as you require and run the apps of your choice . - The only restrictions are the capacities of the server itself and the limitations of the software you run . <p> If you need a dedicated server , it is also very likely that you will be running critical applications that need to be available all the time . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server monitoring , backup facilities and 24/7 technical support . If you choose eUKhost , you also get 100% uptime guarantee , backed by SLA . <p> Another advantage of dedicated servers is that they are more secure . You have the ability to deploy tailored security measures , such as anti-virus and firewall configurations , whilst at the same time , you wo n't have to worry about vulnerable neighbours as you might on shared hosting . For those needing enhanced security , it 's also good to know that the data centres in which dedicated servers are housed have physical security measures in place too , including biometric authentication and security guards . <h> What is cloud hosting ? <p> Cloud hosting is where your website , data and applications are stored on a network of servers which you access over the internet . Whilst it uses virtualisation to achieve this , unlike VPS which uses a single physical server , the cloud uses hundreds , sometimes thousands of physical servers all linked together in a giant network , often across several different geographical locations . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources at their disposal . <p> The advantage here is that businesses are not restricted by their physical hardware as they would be with dedicated servers . If there was a surge in demand for their services , dedicated servers have a limit to which they can operate , with cloud hosting , you can simply bring more of the network into play to ensure that performance continues uninterrupted . This ability to scale up or down as needed is one of the key benefits of cloud computing and the fact that it is paid for on a pay-as-you-go basis means it is highly cost-effective , enabling smaller companies to compete with larger ones . <p> Cloud computing is n't ideal for every single type of use . Whilst capacity is improved , higher performance can still be achieved with dedicated servers . And for organisations that deal with highly sensitive data , such as police or hospital records , it may not be permissible to store that information on servers which can be accessed over the internet . However , it is possible to create private cloud networks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of cloud networking is that it makes it easy to backup and restore data . Cloud networks can provide 100% uptime and can also be used to create a super-quick , low-cost alternative to a backup data centre . <h> What is Managed hosting ? <p> Managed hosting is an additional service where the initial setup , day-to-day maintenance and management of servers is taken care of by the web host rather than by the client . This includes things like updating and patching the operating system , monitoring performance and servicing the hardware . For some types of hosting , such as shared hosting or public cloud , it is necessary that the service provider undertakes these tasks , so they are included as part of the service . <p> With other forms of hosting , particularly dedicated hosting , they can be offered as an option . Sometimes , companies prefer their in-house team to manage the servers , whereas others find it more convenient to leave it to the web host . <h> What is WordPress hosting ? <p> WordPress is a platform that has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress hosting , as it is also called , is a shared hosting service specifically for the platform . <p> With this type of hosting you will find that the servers are optimised for improved WordPress performance ( quicker loading websites ) and that the hosts provide services such as pre-installation , automatic updates and WordPress focused security , such as MTvScan , that protects against the vulnerabilities of the platform . <h> Linux vs Windows hosting <p> Many of the hosting options above will also let you choose between a Linux or a Windows operating system for your server . In reality , the one you pick depends very much on the software you intend to run . For example , if you are going to use WordPress to create your website , you will need to choose Linux . <p> The reasons we mention this is that , if you choose the wrong type , your software may not function on your server . We also mention it because those who are not familiar with hosting may assume that because Windows is the operating system on most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose , however , most websites , are actually run on Linux based servers . <h> Conclusion <p> From reading this article you should now have a clearer understanding of the different types of web hosting available , the differences between them and the advantages and disadvantages of each .

@@14548881 @3148881/ <h> 10 Essential Features of a Good WordPress Host <h> 10 Essential Features of a Good WordPress Host <h> 10 Essential Features of a Good WordPress Host <p> Choosing the right web host for a WordPress website needs to be an informed decision and not one that is based purely on price . In our last post , we discussed the different types of hosting available for WordPress , in this post we are going to show you ten essential features you 'll need in your hosting package . <h> 1 . WordPress specific hosting <p> WordPress is a unique platform and has its own requirements when it comes to hosting . Many of the standard hosting packages available from web hosts will be suitable to run WordPress , but will not always guarantee you all the functionality you need . What you should look for is a web host that specifically offers a WordPress hosting package . <p> By choosing a WordPress package , you will have all you need to run your website effectively . For example , the computer code language WordPress uses , PHP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , MySQL , should be version 5.0 or greater . You may find that some hosting packages use older versions of PHP and MYSQL which , whilst being perfectly adequate for websites built on other platforms , may cause your WordPress site to function badly or even fail . <h> 2 . Choose a web host that provides website security <p> Website security is now a major issue that all owners need to get to grips with . Failing to protect your website can leave it vulnerable to hackers who can infect it with malware , spy on your activities , take down your entire website and steal all the personal data you store " including that of your customers . <p> All web hosts know this , but not all of them will offer security features as part of their hosting packages . You should choose a host that does . <p> Types of security you should look for : <p> Automatic WordPress updates . When WordPress releases an update it will usually include improvements to security , often fixing a new vulnerability . To prevent hackers using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update as soon as it is released . A web host who offers automatic updates will help you achieve this . <p> Vulnerability and malware scanning . Scheduled scanning of your website by your host can identify vulnerabilities and spot malware before it has time to do any damage . You should choose a host that uses a cutting edge scanning tool , like MTvScan. <h> 3 . Security for your customers <p> You may have noticed that some website addresses begin with http ' whilst others begin with https ' . The s ' stands for secure and means that the website has an SSL certificate or Secure Socket Layer . What this means is that any personal information sent to your site by a customer , such as credit card details , is securely encrypted and can not be intercepted by hackers . <p> If you intend to collect any personal information or sell anything via your website , then you must choose a web host who can provide you with SSL security . Many payment gateways ( online companies who let you accept credit card payments ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use their services and many web browsers will inform visitors that your site is not safe to pass details to if you do not have SSL . Also important is that search engines rank e-commerce sites with SSL higher than ones that do n't in their search results . <h> 4 . Website backups <p> The worst possible thing that can happen to a website owner is that they lose their entire website . This can happen due to server failure , hacking , software errors and even by accidental deletion . Not only do you lose all your content and customer details but you will be offline and losing business until the site is rebuilt . If your site is not backed up , this could take months and be very expensive . If you do have a backup , however , you will lose nothing and can be back online in next to no time . <p> It 's essential , therefore , that your WordPress host offers a website backup package . This needs to be a remote backup ( one which is not saved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to schedule frequent backups and can restore your website quickly if needed . <h> 5 . Email Protection <p> When you purchase your domain , you 'll also get access to your own email addresses . Unfortunately , that also means you 'll begin getting spam emails and emails containing malware . For some people , these can vastly outnumber the genuine emails that arrive in their inbox . <p> A good web host will provide an email service that includes a robust spam filter and one that will check the contents of your emails for viruses , trojans and other malicious code . This will help protect you from scammers and hackers and also prevent you having to sort through lots of unsolicited junk mail . <h> 6 . Make administration easier with CPanel <p> It can take quite a while to fully understand all the options and features that your web host provides on your hosting account . It makes this much easier to do if they are clearly organised and easy to navigate . The best solution for this is the CPanel . A CPanel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which let 's you administer every aspect of your account : domains , databases , emails , files , security , software updates , logs and your account info . <h> 7 . Growing Space <p> Websites grow and evolve . A site that might start out as a blog may develop into a membership site with thousands of members , each with their own user area . You may have a business venture that requires lots of different websites , like a range of local business directories . <p> If you expect that your website will grow , then you will need to ensure that the hosting package is big enough for you and has the capacity to let you expand . Check how many gigabytes of storage you are allowed and how many files you can upload to the server . Make sure , too , that you have enough bandwidth to keep you sites online . Most good web hosts will provide a range of packages to choose from . They will also make it easy for you to upgrade to a bigger package or move from shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support <p> Problems can happen at any time of the day and it 's essential that your web host is available to help you when you need it most . Good web hosts , therefore , will provide 24 hours a day technical support . However , there is more to technical support than just being open all day . More important is the level of support you receive . Is there a help forum ? Does the website have a help section or knowledge base ? Can you get support via live chat ? Is there a 24-hour telephone service ? If so , are you dealt with by an expert or someone in a call centre following instructions on a screen ? What do other customers say ? <p> If you are a novice when it comes to the technical aspects of running a website , then technical support will be a valuable tool you will want to use " make sure you choose a web host that provides a high level of service in this area . <h> 9 . The need for speed <p> Google now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faster your site , the better chance it has of ranking higher in search results . Slow loading sites are also very off putting to visitors , many of whom will hit the back button if your pages do not load instantly . <p> One of the issues with WordPress as a platform is that some of the plugins and themes can slow loading times down . To overcome this , WordPress can be dramatically speeded up by caching images , using content delivery networks and by compressing content . A good web host will provide you with the means to do these things in your hosting package . Access to tools like CloudFlare , for example , can speed up loading times by 30%. <h> 10 . Go Local <p> There are two very sound reasons why you should choose a web host which has servers entirely based in your own country . Firstly , as hackers use proxy servers to make them look like they are in one country when they are actually in another , anti-hacking software is becoming increasingly suspicious of websites where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So a co.uk website hosted on a server in the US might cause suspicion , even if it is entirely legitimate . <p> The second reason is to do with a recent change in the law concerning data protection .

Most of the businesses and enterprises today are somewhat aware that Cloud solutions can offer them a helping hand with saving financial resources . Now , if that 's the case , no business can resist the temptation of building their own Cloud . Well it is indeed possible , but an evaluation of the Private Cloud vs Public Cloud is important before proceeding with actually starting to invest in it . <h> Application Deployment in the Cloud <p> As compared to the usage of Cloud Computing , there is much larger discussion that happening in fact .

The Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers , firewall , switches and related with its customers as a part of IT as a service . These offerings are usually on a pay-per-month basis . <p> Whereas , in a private cloud type of set-up , a business enterprize would create its own cloud set-up on site . One of the major differences between public cloud and private cloud is that , the business enterprise does not share their resources with any other users expect their own staff . This can act as an extended step towards enhanced security , as their resources are n't  shared outside the organisation . <p> The only constraint with Private Clouds is that , your business needs to invest in the hardware , build it and ofcourse manage it on your own . <p> There are efforts been taken to develop a new concept termed as the Hybrid Cloud which acts as an intermediate solution for Private and Public Clouds . The hybrid cloud environment enables business enterprizes that do not intend to switch to either of the two , to choose a third party provider to build a private cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew etc . Such a cloud is created on the site of the customer whereas the third party Cloud Hosting provider takes care of provisioning , setup , required licensing , cloud monitoring , maintenance and the 100% management of the servers in the Cloud cluster .

Not to mention that the hybrid cloud would be more expensive as compared to the the public cloud , due to the open fact that Cloud hosting provider is unable to share the equipment expenditure among other customers and make a recovery . <p> Based on the above evaluations , small and medium sized businesses prefer choosing Public Cloud hosting solutions for managing their IT infrastructural resources .

The bots and spiders are often BaiduSpider and its derivatives , and I am quite concerned that these may either be disguised hackers or spammers , or just be aberrant ( I 've got quite fed up in the past with the frequency BaiduSpider seesm to be regularly accessing and scanning files on the rest of my site : sometimes many times a day , which uses up bandwidth ) The locations are given when I look at the details returned from " Recent Visitors " , but using an ordinary file manager or ftp program , I just can not locate them . Although the bots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain concerned that I can not access the files and directories to perhaps put in place my own protection solutions . <p> Could anyone advise me about how to make them visible ( if they are hidden ) or where they are located ? Could this be an issue of what my document root is set up to be ? Thanks <h> Comment <p> Thanks . I could do that , but it does n't solve the problem I have of finding out where the material for the mailing lists is actually stored , does it ? That is the underlying issue I would like to have some information about . <p> Thanks for offering the solution , however , as it is one that I was considering , but it is almost a reactive solution ( i.e. , one has to have the details of who has accessed the material first in order to know what to block ) , whereas I was asking about the location of files to do some more proactive protection . <p> As it happens , the target audience for the files are mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not as a free-for-all , because of the problems I have had before of people accessing the material , changing author 's names , and passing it off as by themselves . I 've made the archives of the list private , but somehow , BaiduSpider and others seem to be by-passing that . Hence my questions . <p> DDS - China and UK . <h> Comment <p> I assume that you are looking for the path of where your mailing list is located , use the following path to check : **28;578;TOOLONG , you 'd need to login to your cPanel control panel first to view it . <p> Your 2nd question was about blocking the Baidu spiders .

Thanks for the links . I have read them before , but I am beginning to think that some spammers may be disguising their user-agents to be baidu spiders , since myself and some other people ( who are mostly concerned with forum spamming ) have had similar problems with what appears to be BaiduSpiders apparently ignoring robots.txt , and they have had no joy when they have contacted Baidu about it directly . Hence my need to explore how I can take steps to protect the directories in some other way , which led me to my puzzlement about where the mailman directories are actually to be found in my webspace . <p> I really am sorry if these questions are stupid or based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going on here because of the presence of directories when you call up a web address , and their absence when you try to access them using a ftp program . <p> DDS - China and UK . <h> Comment <p> First of all , I 'd like to note that the mailing list and its archives can not be accessed through a FTP program though you 're using the correct FTP details of your account .

Now how , if you reboot a server or a machine , normally the machine or the servers are stopped and then started . During this reboot any running applications are closed directly/immediately without giving a chance for it to commence its execution ! ! That will obviously have an impact over the applications running and may corrupt them or leave them in incomplete status after the server comes online . <p> What happens next is , in case of a forceful reboot it shuts the application directly , which means the application sends immediate kill/termination requests/signals to all the child processes running under it , no matter at what stage that child processes are and after that the parent process kills itself . Whereas in graceful reboot , all the applications are requested to close their child processes and once they are done with serving the requests then a reboot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications are given time to execute themselves and they are not forced to terminate themselves immediately . <p> Thereafter soon as the server comes online after a graceful reboot , the parent processes of the applications can re-read their configuration files and re-opens the respective log files .

However after a forceful reboot parent processes can not re-read the configuration as the applications were killed immediately and therefore configurations were never written in the first place . <p> Therefore the applications never get locked or corrupted in Graceful reboot but the chances are higher in Forceful reboots . <p> Very nice and informative points you had provided about graceful reboot along with that , you had also described about the differences of graceful and forceful reboot which definitely going to help the user in an effective manner . <h> Comment <p> It is good to use graceful robot as graceful means shutting down all the operations accept allowing current operating to finish .

I have a DNS setup for my IP address but I do n't know what DNS is for in a website . Is the DNS in the website different or the same with the DNS of the IP address ? <p> DNS is simply a database that links meaningful names ( known as host names ) , such as Microsoft Corporation , to a specific IP address , such as 192.168.124.1 . Simply linking addresses to names is just the beginning , though , because DNS has many more features in addition to host-name-to-address mapping . <p> The key features of host name to IP mapping are as follows : <p> * Mappings of addresses to names &amp; vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database . * The DNS database is distributed . * A DNS database also stores additional records . <p> Although DNS is a database , most importantly it 's a distributed database .

Because of this arrangement , each DNS server maintains only a small portion of the total DNS host to IP address mappings . The collection of host-name-to-IP-address mappings contained with the DNS database is also known as a namespace . Essentially , when looking for a name in DNS , the DNS client first checks a top-level DNS server database . That server tells the client which DNS server hosts the next part of the DNS name , &amp; the client then queries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DNS server that hosts the DNS record in question , &amp; that server provides the IP address . <p> In addition to the basic IP-address-to-host-name mapping records stored by the DNS database , records are also maintained by DNS for other purposes . DNS contains a number of record types that facilitate other applications . The Mail Exchanger ( MX ) record , for example , provides mail servers with the information required to forward e-mail messages to the recipient 's e-mail server . <h> Comment <p> Thank you .. there 's no possibility of duplication of DNS as the naming authority makes sure such things are n't practiced <p> The programmers did a very good job of this because the internet is a very populated place .

@@14548903 @3148903/ <h> What is the future of the private cloud ? <h> What is the future of the private cloud ? <p> Private clouds can be expensive , large scale projects that are carried out over a number of years . They 're designed to offer customers near-limitless capacity and a cost-effective way of consolidating their physical server footprint . However , the future of the private cloud is a bit hazy with many large enterprises choosing to keep a large proportion of their IT services in-house so that they can retain more control , but more importantly to meet regulatory requirements . The costs involved have meant that many businesses have been taking a staggered approach to cloud migration , instead choosing to move as old hardware reaches the end of its useful life rather than moving everything over in one go . <h> Big companies moving aggressively towards the public cloud <p> With a private cloud , a business will purchase an environment of a pre-agreed capacity ; this capacity can be assigned to virtual machines so that a tailored infrastructure can be created . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point become limiting , or the customer may fail to utilise the capacity effectively and could be left with a large amount of redundant resources . <p> The public cloud on the other hand provides an abundance of resources that customers can access in the same way that they 'd be able to in the private cloud , the difference being that they 're only paying for their usage and not a pre-defined infrastructure that may not completely engage with their requirements in the long-term . <h> Hosted solutions represent cost-effective support strategy <p> Hosted solutions are private cloud products that are sold by web hosting companies ; customers are provided with their own private cloud infrastructure , but the underlying hardware is owned and supported by the hosting company . Whilst these solutions require only a small initial outlay , in the long-term they can prove to be the most costly option as you will be paying the same price every month for as long as you utilise the service , whereas if you invest in your own hardware then whether you pay for the equipment outright or get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardware will still have a residual value . However , for many the attraction of hosted services is the level of support that accompanies these packages . <p> IT support can be a major expense for businesses of any size , and a hosted solution is one way in which this cost can be cut since the expense of support will be included in the price for the private cloud , reducing the need for private cloud customers to retain their own internal IT departments . The issue with retaining an internal IT department for such purposes is that you will have to pay them even when there may not necessarily be any work for them to do , whereas for a lower cost you can call on the cloud provider 's support team to offer assistance whenever you need them . Outsourced support also has the benefit of being 24 hours , whilst if you were to maintain an IT department internally on such hours then the cost would likely be very prohibitive . <p> Hosted solutions may represent the most cost-effective solution for businesses looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosted solution can be prohibitive for some , citing the lack of control over what hardware is used and there being no physical access to the servers . <h> Mixing the clouds <p> There is very few companies that have a need to migrate their entire infrastructure to the cloud , in scenarios where existing hardware is not yet at the end of its useful life or particular applications are better suited to dedicated hardware , businesses are likely to stall the migration in favour of moving things over at a time that will be least disruptive and most financially sensible . Hybrid cloud products let businesses utilise a bit of everything ; public cloud servers can be integrated with a private cloud infrastructure , whilst all of this can be configured to work with a business 's existing dedicated hardware infrastructure " even if this hardware is hosted internally or at a remote location . <p> Such an approach to the cloud enables business to tailor a platform that is complimentary of all of their requirements ; some view the cloud as trying to provide a one size fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better off hosted in-house or on dedicated hardware , and hybrid cloud products let businesses utilise their existing platforms and make use of new technologies concurrently . <p> The hybrid cloud could be a catalyst for utilising the private cloud in the future . Rather than businesses purchasing and maintaining a single private cloud environment , the hybrid connector will enable them to pick and choose the cloud elements that they use . <h> The impact of regulatory requirements <p> Most businesses have to work to regulatory requirements dictating how the personal information of their customers can be handled and these requirements have in some cases been restricting the level to which an organisation can engage with the private cloud . Using banks and financial institutions as an example , regulations prevent them from holding any personally identifiable information and details in a cloud environment ; whilst anonymised data can be held in the cloud , any identifiable information has to be hosted on their own internal systems . It is for this reason that such establishments have been utilising a hybrid approach since this enables them to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the rules the govern their industry . <p> I would say that the private cloud does have a sustainable future , primarily with larger enterprises for which it is n't possible to share a hosting environment with any other users . Whilst I do n't expect to see too many standalone private cloud environments , a private cloud as part of a hybrid solution will enable customers to choose where they host which services and a mix of public , private and dedicated means that there will always be a platform available for whatever a specific applications requirements may be . It wo n't disappear completely , but its use will decline slightly as customers realise the cost benefits of the public cloud and the private benefits of retaining a certain proportion of services in-house . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> Benefits Of Private Cloud Architecture <p> Choosing a private cloud for your business website can be worth an investment .

In other words server mirroring can also be described as utilizing a backup server that duplicates all the data of the master server , this is done either for Disaster Recovery Hosting ( DR Hosting ) or to have redundancy to avoid data loss incase of failure of main server . After the implementation of mirroring , if for any reason , the master server fails , the slave server can immediately take its place without any downtime . <p> The usage of server mirroring technology can solve many different issues such as : <p> Automated Data Back-ups : Tracking file changes independently and replicating those changes using Rsync , thereby maintaining a real-time copy of data than copying an entire file that has changed . <p> Enable efficient use of server resources and increase overall redundancy of each server . <p> Data Replication <p> We at eUKhost have implemented our in-house developed Mirroring Solution using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 similar configuration servers in 2 different racks out of which one server is master server and other is slave . Any file update or change on the master server flags itself and FAM gets notified about the Flag . FAM module then sends a request to Rsync to copy the file update on the Slave server and the file is immediately transmitted on to the Slave server . This process is completed in a very short period of time and does n't use up any server resources even if the files which are changed are of larger size . <p> Failover/Failure monitoring <p> Failover is a process in which the slave server stands in for master server in case the master server goes down . With the help of Failover , user and application requests that are directed to the failed master server are routed to the slave server .

Restoration process only requires selection of the source , target , and the appropriate replication set . There is no need to select files or to remember where the data came from on the source since that information is maintained by Rsync . Restoration can be used if the data on the master server is lost due to a disk crash or when the most up-to-date data exists on the slave server due to failover . At the time of a master server failure , the slave server will contain the same data as the master server . Because of the continued updates on the slave server , when the master server is back online , the two servers will no longer contain the same data . Restoration is the process of copying the incremental data from the slave server back to the master server . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SAP / ERP Hosting , Server Mirroring and Failover Redundancy to ensure 100% server uptime and network uptime guarantee !

From the standpoint of the consumer : define an updated corporate image , demonstrating an evolving organization , modern and able to offer a product or service quality . <p> Capabilities and Features of the Model B2C <p> The Internet has quickly become a vital component for companies . The role and importance of electronic markets have been increasingly varied . The power of electronic circuits such as the Internet to increase efficiency of business performance is one of the most important reasons for it .

In parallel , consumers compare the performances of different business systems and , while not knowing they assign names , places the associated logistics systems in question ( Carvalho , 2006 , p.41 ) ; <p> The fact that the supplier does not own stock in one of the ordered products considered essential by the client , you can also call into question the performance of the supplier .

Content farms are websites with low-quality or shallow content . Sometimes these websites that can be considered content farms have very similar content across many websites or articles on certain subjects that are shallow in context and are generally unhelpful to a reader . <p> Google is targeting these kinds of websites because they detract from the quality of search engine results- and do not provide a good user experience when the top search engine results do not provide the website or page that the end user is looking for . <h> What is webspam ? <p> A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of random keywords and hyperlinks placed in the content for search engine optimisation purposes. - Google gave a good example of webspam shown below if you read the blog post , you 'll immediately notice how poor the quality of the content is and the fact there are random backlinks stuffed in the article itself that are completely irrelevant from what the article is about .

I think that they could lead to web addresses that are a lot easier to remember because telling someone ipad.technology ' rather than apple.com/uk/ipad ' , or an even more complicated Apple Store URL , is a lot easier and let 's face it " they 're more likely to remember the first address . <p> Changing a domain name website-wide <p> Web hosting control panels make it simple to change the domain name that an entire website is related to because all you need to do is change the domain name for the hosting account and this change is then reflected across all related data , such as email addresses and FTP accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new domain name at the right name servers and you should be all set to go . <p> If you have coded the domain name into internal links on your website such as where you have hyperlinks or links to other files such as Javascript includes or stylesheets , you may need to go through your code to change these in order to guarantee that your website continues to work after the change has been made . <p> SEO implications of using a new address <p> There could be major SEO implications of switching to a new domain name . Google and other popular search engines will have become accustomed to the structure of your website , what the most popular pages are and will have even given the domain a ranking based on its age .

This will of course have a huge impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of your SEO work from scratch . <p> Setting up a redirect <p> The simplest way of purchasing a new gTLD domain and being able to use it with your existing website would be to setup a redirect , and this is a feature included with the purchase of a domain from most major registrars and web hosting companies . <p> My opinion is that if you have already established your website under an existing domain that has received a good placing in search engines , just setup the new address as a redirect as to not undo the hard work if you 've already put in. - This will circumvent the need to migrate any services because the hassle it would cause is n't worth it and would only work to create more work for you. - - If you are going to be creating a completely new website then consider the new gTLDs that are available as this could allow you to use a more relevant address that is easier to remember . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> 10 Essential Features of a Good WordPress Host <p> 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web host for a WordPress website needs to be an informed decision and not one that is based purely on price .

In this article , we 'll give you the heads up on the current trends in cloud computing and show you what 's likely to be in store in 2017 . For those companies that have n't considered using the cloud yet , what you read here might make you change your mind . <h> 1 . Businesses investing more in the cloud <p> According to the IDG 's 2016 Enterprise Cloud Computing Survey , investment in cloud computing is set to continue its upwards trend during 2017 with US companies planning to spend an average of $1.77M on the cloud and companies in Europe and the rest of the world spending $1.3M . For larger companies , with over 1000 employees , the average figure is $3M . Of those large companies , one in ten will spend at least $10M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted that 2017 will see companies spending 28% of their IT budgets on cloud computing. - Most of this , 45% , will be spent on Software as a Service ( SaaS ) with a further 30% on Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) . In addition , companies will spend 19% of their cloud budgets using Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) for development . <h> 2 . Most companies using cloud to run apps <p> Cloud computing is fast becoming the standard way for businesses to run apps . At least 70% of all organisations have a cloud run app ( up from 51% in 2011 ) and for larger organisations , the figure is even higher ( 75% ) . Indeed , by 2020 the prediction is that 90% of all organisations will be running cloud apps . <p> 2017 will see the adoption of cloud applications accelerate and expand , with a far wider range of apps being available to use . It is estimated that by the end of the year , most IT departments will have the majority of their apps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Companies moving more services to the cloud <p> IDG asked companies how they will develop their reliance on cloud computing over the next 18 months , with some surprising results . At the moment , the average company runs 45% of its operations in the cloud ( 23% private cloud , 15% Public Cloud and 7% hybrid cloud ) . In 18 months those companies plan to increase reliance on the cloud to 60% ( 28% private cloud , 22% public cloud and 10% hybrid cloud ) . - This tells us that not only are companies pushing more and more of their environment to the cloud but that , increasingly , they are favouring public cloud as the place to go . <p> The other thing we learn is that businesses are starting to use using multiple cloud models to meet differing IT needs . Currently , 62% of companies use private cloud , 60% use public cloud and 26% use a hybrid . <h> 4 . Data becoming the key driver of cloud adoption <p> Big data analytics is fast becoming a critical tool and businesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud has to offer in this area . Larger companies can make enormous savings by migrating to a cloud network whilst , for smaller businesses , the cloud offers them the opportunities to compete with larger enterprises on a level playing field . <p> For this reason , big data analytics , data storage and data management are the main reasons why businesses are adopting cloud technology . 43% of companies cite these as their main reason for migration during 2017 ( 22% for analytics and 21% for storage and management ) . <h> 5 . Who is spending the money ? <p> There is a difference between large and small organisations when it comes to who controls the budgets on cloud adoption . In enterprise sized organisations , the spending is driven by chief information officers , IT architects and the IT networking management . In small and medium sized businesses , the push for cloud investment and spending is being made by chief executives , chief financial officers and chief information officers . The reason for this could be that SMBs do n't have in-house architects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the authority to spend the budgets without having to bring it before more senior officers first . <p> Perhaps one of the biggest differences is the influence of the chief IT security officer . This person has influence over cloud IT spending in 80% of enterprises but only 59% of SMBs . With security , such an issue across the board , it looks like senior management is listening to security concerns much more in bigger companies than smaller ones . <h> 6 . Concerns that hinder cloud adoption <p> Whilst cloud adoption is on the rise and many companies are benefitting from it , some companies still have reservations about using it . From their survey , IDG found that the main concerns amongst companies were issues with where data is stored , cloud security and vendor lock-in . <p> The issue regarding where data is stored is fired by some governments ' insistence that they should have access to data stored on servers within their borders . For example , if a UK company had sensitive data stored on a server based in the US , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously , may prevent a UK business choosing a vendor with US based servers . For this reason , many expect that companies will move towards a localisation model in the next year with many businesses choosing cloud vendors based within their own country . <p> When it comes to cloud security , cloud vendors generally have better security in place than in-house data centres . They have to meet robust standards and have the expert IT staff in place to ensure consistent monitoring and defence . In addition , their use of up to date hardware and software means they are less likely to be vulnerable to the security holes found in data centres that use legacy software and older hardware . <p> With regard to vendor lock-in ( the over-reliance on a vendor 's infrastructure and management ) , the advice is to rethink how you manage your IT . Companies do need to use the cloud and they do need the IT services that cloud vendors bring . To prevent being tied to any one vendor , they just need to develop the in-house skills needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of in-house skills is also one of the problems that prevent many companies adopting private or hybrid cloud computing . In the next year , as more companies begin to see that cloud adoption is more of a when than an if , it is likely we 'll see a rise in IT spending on training to develop these skills . <h> Conclusion <p> A few years ago , moving to the cloud was seen as something which could give a company an advantage over those which had not . It is no longer seen in that way . Today , it 's pretty much indispensable and those who do n't have it are seen as disadvantaged . Over the next year , cloud adoption is going to increase even more . More companies are going to use it , and those that already use it are going to increase their reliance upon it . @qwx190775 <h> How important is online cloud backup for business solutions ? <p> All businesses should have data protection plans in place so that if a situation arises that results in data loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been lost as quickly as p ... <h> Importance of API Keys in Cloud <p> Similar to the SSL keys , API keys too are being considered to be an important factors for strengthening security in Cloud Hosting environment .

In this article , we 'll look at the four main ways of obtaining stock , making , manufacturing , wholesale and drop shipping , in order to give you a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each . <h> 1 ) Making your own products <p> Many successful businesses have grown out of people 's hobbies and for those who love creating things , making you 're your own products is the ideal way to stock your online store . Whether you make cakes , clothing or candles , you can carry on doing what you have a passion for whilst supplying your business at the same time . <p> Making your own products also enable- you to have full control over the quality of your stock and this can be very useful when creating a new brand where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition. - It is also a way for you to start small and build your business as demand grows ; if you are selling what you make as a hobby , the chances are that you can do it from home with relatively small start-up costs . You may have already acquired much of the equipment you need and have the skills in place to ensure good quality , saleable products . <p> There are , however , some considerations which need to be made . Once your hobby becomes a business , it may not stay as enjoyable when you have to complete products to order . In addition , being involved in the manufacture and the selling side of your business can be very demanding . As your business grows , you may no longer have the capacity to do all the tasks you need to do and might need to outsource some of the work or take on employees to do the work for you . <p> In addition , many homemade products have health and safety considerations . If you make anything edible , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules which need to be adhered to before they can be sold to the general public . This adds another layer of bureaucracy to your business and increased administrative responsibility . <p> Of course , this type of product sourcing is not suitable for every type of business . Some products can not be manufactured by hand and need specialist technology. - However , even hi-tech products can be made at home " there are plenty of computer geeks out there making a living selling bespoke made computers . <h> 2 ) Have your products manufactured for you <p> One method used by many online businesses is to have their products manufactured for them . You would be surprised at how many famous brands use another manufacturer to make products on their behalf . It usually makes good business sense " provided you find the right manufacturer . <p> Having your products made by another company means you do not need to invest in building your own production operation or have to run that side of the business . On the downside , this can reduce the control you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacture into the trust of another business . You will need to ensure that the manufacturer can create the products exactly to your quality requirements . <p> Another benefit of using a manufacturer is that it can help you increase the capacity of your business , enabling you to sell more products with improved economies of scale . If you were previously making your own products , but have expanded beyond your own manufacturing limits , then this is the obvious next step in your development . You do need to make sure that the manufacturer has the capacity to produce the quantity of goods you require and on time . Running out of stock can have dire consequences for both cash flow and business reputation . <p> Sometimes , having your products manufactured for , you can actually work out less expensive than making them yourselves . Manufacturers often have the infrastructure in place to ensure they can compete competitively , producing goods with low overheads by utilising the latest technology and production methods . They are also likely to have better purchasing power , enabling them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing this method of finding stock , you also open yourself up to the potential of the world-wide market . Importing products from abroad can massively reduce the costs of manufacturing , helping you to increase margins further . However , importing is not straightforward " there can be issues with language barriers , problems with shipping and the need to pay import duties . There have also been quite a few problems with people being defrauded in scams involving bogus foreign companies . You should always use a company with a proven track record of working with UK companies . <h> 3 ) Purchase your products from a wholesaler <p> If you want to sell other products instead of your own brand , then the main method of sourcing them is to buy them from a wholesaler . Usually in retail , manufacturers sell products in very large numbers to wholesalers who , because of the size of their orders , get them at huge discounts . Acting as the middleman , the wholesalers then sell them on , in bulk , to retailers . Again , because retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to sell to the general public with a reasonable margin . Often , the more a retailer buys , the cheaper they will get the products , enabling them to have higher margins or to be more competitive on price . <p> Although the process of using a wholesaler is straightforward , there are risks involved . Buying in bulk can have an impact on cash flow . If much of a company 's money has been tied up buying inventory then there can be little room for manoeuvre if anything goes wrong . This can be exacerbated if the company buys products which it can not sell enough of . If you have to buy one hundred products to get them cheap enough to sell at a profit , but you only sell 50 of them , then your business is in trouble . One way out of this is to cut your losses and sell the products off at the same price you bought them for , just to get your money back . This is why we see so many sales in retail " businesses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more saleable products . <p> The other difficulty with selling another company 's products is competition . When you sell your own products you can set your own prices because no one else is selling them ; when you sell other branded products , you are in competition with lots of other retailers and it is easy for shoppers to search for the best price . Smaller companies can have real difficulty here as larger competitors can sell cheaply and back this up with fast and free delivery and first class customer service . To have a chance , smaller companies should focus on niche market sectors where they can position themselves as expert providers . By becoming a specialist in a small range of products , they can gain the trust of the customer and this can be a way of overcoming having to charge more for the products . <h> 4 ) Use a drop shipper <p> An increasing number of wholesalers now offer online retailers a drop shipping service . Drop shipping is an ideal product sourcing method for start-up businesses with limited cash flow because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken an order from a customer . Only when they have sold the product do they order it and , thereby , remove any risk of buying stock that does n't sell . <p> What makes drop shipping even more attractive is that the wholesaler takes care of the product fulfilment ; delivering it , on the retailer 's behalf , directly to the customer . As a retailer , you are left with the simple task of selling the products . No cash flow worries , no stock handling , no need for stock insurance and no delivery expenditure " nor any need to pay people to undertake these jobs . <p> In an ideal world , every online retailer would choose drop shipping , however , there are a number of downsides which need to be considered . Firstly , not every wholesaler is prepared to offer drop shipping , which can limit the choice of products you can sell . Secondly , the service that wholesalers offer comes at a price , usually in the form of much reduced margins . Whilst a traditional retailer , buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the RRP , a retailer using the drop shipping service might only get a 10% discount . Overall it 's a balancing act ; you make less per product but make dramatic savings on overheads and wo n't have to write off any unsold stock . <p> Another area of concern is in choosing the right drop shippers . In the US , drop shipping is a well-established business technique with many wholesalers and manufacturers seeing it as a real way of building business with smaller , online traders . In the UK , the practice is just taking off and whilst there are a growing number of wholesalers discovering the benefits of offering the service , there are also a few unscrupulous wholesalers who charge you just for opening a drop shipping account and then offer margins so poor that there is no real way of making a profit . The worst of these companies then have their own retail arms that will undercut their own customers in the market place . As a rule , you should avoid using these companies . <p> Many wholesalers and retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , so sometimes the only way to find out is to contact them and enquire . If you find a reputable company that will do this for you and which offers reasonable margins , then you have the perfect opportunity to build a relatively risk-free , online retail business . <h> Conclusion <p> Finding the best way to stock your online store can be a difficult decision .

The outlook for 2017 looks just as pessimistic " not just because of an increase in attacks but also because cybercriminals are beginning to exploit an even wider range of vulnerabilities . <h> How will cyber-attacks develop in 2017 ? <p> What should concern us most about the predictions for 2017 is not just the increase in the number cyber-attacks but the change in how they are carried out . Here are some examples of how things may develop in 2017 . <h> Bringing down the internet with a kettle <p> As was widely reported in the news , October saw the world 's biggest DDoS attack on DNS company Dyn , causing some very high-profile companies , including Twitter and PayPal , to go offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this attack different was that it was launched using Internet of Things devices : fridges , watches , smart meters , etc . <p> The ease with which the attack took place was put down to the owners not changing the simple to crack , default passwords . Once in , hackers were able to infect the machines with malware that could launch the DDoS attack . <p> What 's worrying , is that most IoT products are vulnerable to infections that can be used to launch attacks against businesses. - Until cyber security firms can find a way around this , the door is wide-open for criminals . <h> Cyber criminals to use machine learning <p> According to the McAfee 2017 Threats Predictions report , cybercriminals are now using machine learning to target victims of the Business Employee Compromise ( BEC ) scam ( where fraudulent emails are used to con employees into transferring company funds into the criminals ' accounts ) . <p> BEC scammers use social engineering to defraud their victims , and their ability to pick the right targets and manipulate them is being improved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex analysis are easily attainable as is the publicly available data required to build and train their malicious algorithms . <p> McAfee expects the ease at which cybercriminals can access machine learning will increase the numbers of social engineering attacks in 2017 and make it more likely that they are successful . It 's also likely that these attacks will be aimed at even more high profile business executives , CEOs finance directors , etc . <h> Bad ads to deliver malware <p> Techniques being developed by advertisers to ensure that ads can bypass ad-blocking apps are being used by cybercriminals as a means to distribute malware . Advertisers use hooks to make computers execute arbitrary code , enabling ads to show up without the user 's permission . According to McAfee , by 2017 , malware distributors will be using the same techniques to massively increase the numbers of drive-by malware downloads on the devices of unsuspecting users . <h> Going for hardware <p> With the security industry focused on protecting software , 2017 will see cybercriminals turn their attention to hardware . Vulnerable hardware can undermine the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not defend it , the only real fix is to replace the hardware itself . This can obviously put some businesses at financial risk . <p> McAfee predicts that 2017 will see a hardware attacks being used much more by state-sponsored attackers as they have the ability to exploit systems that use legacy firmware as well as firmware on solid-state drives , network cards and Wi-Fi devices . <h> Ransomware to peak in 2017 <p> Ransomware has increased from just over 2 million attacks in the first quarter of 2014 to almost 9 million in the third quarter of 2016 . This rise is set to continue until at least the first half of 2017 . One of the reasons for the rise is the various ways criminals can get their hands on the software . You can purchase Ransomware-as-a-Service , buy bespoke ransomware from the dark web , or even create your own from open-source ransomware code . <p> The focus of ransomware is also expected to shift during 2017 with more attacks expected on phones and other mobile devices . McAfee also expects to see DDoS being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The good news is that it is expected that there will be a concerted effort across all cyber security companies during 2017 to tackle ransomware which McAfee believe will see a levelling off of attacks in the second half of the year . However , this does n't mean companies can be complacent . <h> 10 tips to secure your system in 2017 <p> To defend against the increased threat of hacking in 2017 , we highly recommend you take the following steps : <h> 1 . Update to the latest versions of your software <p> Vulnerable legacy software is an open window to cybercriminals who have the web monitoring tools at hand to find companies who are using old apps . Updating to the latest version instantly removes these vulnerabilities and stops hackers exploiting them on your system . <p> If you can , auto-update . It saves time and worry . Managed hosting can also be a great way to ensure this is done for your operating software . <h> 2 . Keep up to date with developers ' guidelines <p> For improved security , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their application safe . To make sure the procedures you put in place are current , ensure you are signed up for their email updates . This will also be helpful if a vulnerability is discovered and you need to take action quickly . <h> 3 . Switch to https with site-wide SSL or TLS <p> Last year we were encouraging people to enable site-wide SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) to securely encrypt links between a server and a client . This was to prevent hackers using man in the middle attacks ' stealing personal data , credit card information and passwords during transmission . <p> Whilst SSL is still highly secure , there is now a new protocol called Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) which splits encrypted communication between two servers so , even if it is intercepted and unencrypted , only part of the data will be present . <p> Both SSL and TLS can be used with HTTPS. <h> 4 . Enable intrusion prevention systems <p> Intrusion prevention systems can be configured to offer robust protection for some of your applications and are included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , is included in Plesk and has predefined rulesets to defend WordPress. <h> 5 . Protect your site using the . htaccess file <p> If you use Apache , you can protect your site from attack simply by making changes to your . htaccess file . Adding a few lines of instructions can block unauthorised access to the database and admin area whilst preventing directory browsing and the access to files . <h> 6 . Ensure you use a vulnerability scanner <p> One way to make sure your site is consistently protected is to use a vulnerability scanner . Apps such as MTvScan , which we use at eUKhost , scan for software holes , malware and intrusions on your website , ensuring your website is thoroughly defended . <h> 7 . Backup your data regularly <p> Losing your website and data can put you out of business if you can not recover quickly enough . The best way to do this is to regularly backup your website and database files . This way , if you are hacked , you can restore your website relatively quickly and inexpensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or database will affect how often you need to back up . If you sell online and constantly take orders , for example , you may need constant backups so you do not lose recent sales . <h> 8 . Make sure your application firewall is enabled <p> To protect yourself against cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks , you need to have a securely configured application firewall . This will ensure that you have a predefined ruleset that will block malicious HTTP requests which do n't conform to the rules . <p> At eUKhost , our Linux servers have the modsecurity application firewall installed on both Plesk and cPanel , giving clients a number of custom rulesets which can be enabled . <h> 9 . Use a high-performance network firewall <p> A network firewall is another essential element needed to protect your website from sophisticated cyber-attacks .

This enables us to : <p> Prevent data loss by monitoring behaviour that could lead to data loss <p> Protect against malware in real-time <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firewall offers the most advanced threat intelligence available to protect your network . It provides end-to-end security throughout the full attack cycle and has been independently validated to provide 99%+ security effectiveness . And for ease of use , it enables all monitoring and management to be undertaken from a single pane of glass interface . <h> 10 . Forget passwords " use a credential vault <p> Despite the sophisticated apps used to defend your system , the Achilles heel for many businesses is weak passwords . Too many businesses do not have strict enough password policies and this leads to staff having weak passwords or failing to keep them secure . This puts you at risk from both internal and external criminals . <p> The best way to stop this is to give users passwords which they do not know . A credential vault would create highly secure passwords for users and change them frequently . The users would not need to know the password , they 'd just need to validate their credentials . Doing this would guarantee that the user ca n't lose or give the password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift in focus for cybercriminals . As security companies make progress in many areas , hackers will move their efforts to new vulnerabilities , including the Internet of Things , drive-by-malware distribution , DDoS ransoms and social engineering . Of course , many will continue to use existing types of attacks so we should not ignore these , either . <p> In addition , they 'll probably be a few software companies launching products or updates with giant security holes in them ; so , keep an eye out for zero day vulnerabilities too . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> 10 DoFollow Points to Keep Your Photos Safe on the Internet <p> The technology has two faces like a coin ; it helps human beings to improve the performance and can be dangerous to harm anyone .

In this post , we 'll explain what memberships sites are , examine the kinds of business you can set up with them , and look at the best plugins you can use to create them . <h> What is a membership site ? <p> A membership site is a website which restricts people from accessing some of its content until they have signed up or paid to become a member . This is usually done for one of two reasons : <p> To sell access to member only content , for example , movies on Netflix . <p> To restrict access for security purposes , e.g. internal area of a school website . <p> To gain access to the restricted areas of a membership website , a user can be asked to do some or all of the following : <h> What types of business can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites work by offering their members something which they can not get elsewhere , for example , expert advice , exclusive content or discounted products . Here are some examples : <h> Expert information or advice <p> Information or advice sites earn their money by selling access to content that would normally be expensive to buy . If you were an expert in your field and had unique content that people would be willing to pay for , then this would be an ideal business to consider . Examples of expert advice membership websites include : <p> WordPress development websites <p> Nutritional blogs <p> Legal advice forums <p> Stocks and shares advice websites <p> Car maintenance sites <p> In fact , if you had expertise in any field that people would normally pay for , then that would make ideal content for a membership site . <h> Exclusive content <p> These sites generate an income through giving users access to content which ca n't be found elsewhere or would be difficult to access . For example : <p> Teachers classroom resources <p> Legal document downloads ( templates for wills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building instructions <p> Jobs " such as being able to bid for freelance work on Fiverr <p> Wholesale suppliers directories <p> Dating sites <h> Discounts , deals and bargains <p> Many websites have a discounted products section which requires you to become a member to join . - Whilst most of these are free and are used as a marketing strategy , others charge for access to the discounted products on offer . These include : <p> Entertainments sites ( e.g. Amazon Prime , Audible ) <p> Online stores ( e.g. Costco ) <h> How are membership sites structured ? <p> For start-up membership sites looking to get established , the usual structure is as follows:1 . A home area on your website which gives clear information about your website and organisation . This will also include information about your products and services and about the pricing . <p> 2 . A free content area is often created to act as the opening of your sales funnel . For example , if you were selling access to teachers ' resources , you may have a good selection of free resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area enables relevant content to get indexed by search engines , helping you to attract visitors to your site . If those visitors like the free resources , you increase your chances of them paying for membership . <p> 3 . Levels of access can then be created for customers purchasing different packages . If you have bronze , silver and gold packages , you can have bronze silver and gold areas on your site . The more expensive the package , the better the content . <p> - <p> You can also control access in other ways . For example , the teachers ' resources site could offer two resource downloads a week for its bronze package , five downloads for the silver and unlimited downloads for the gold . <p> 4. blog is a key element of many membership sites . Users are asked to subscribe to an email list in order to access the free content . They then receive emails and blog posts which are ultimately aimed at getting them to pay for premium membership . Once they have paid , they start receiving emails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which offer them members only deals on other products . <h> How do I create a membership site on WordPress ? <p> Luckily , you can turn your WordPress website into a membership site just by installing a plugin . Without a plugin , creating a membership site would be difficult to achieve without the aid of a developer . A website needs to have the following elements to become a membership site : <p> Sign up area <p> Payment gateway <p> My Account area for users to manage their membership <p> Different content areas for each level of membership <p> There is a range of good WordPress membership plugins you can choose from but you need to make sure you use one which has the features you require for your particular website . For example , not all provide the ability to offer different levels of membership . <p> Here are our four favourite membership plugins for WordPress : <h> 1 . MemberPress <p> MemberPress is a premium plugin that offers a wide range of features for your membership site . It 's easy to set up and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages you need to run your membership business , such as the membership options and pricing page , member login and the My Account area.As you would expect , you have total control over which areas of the website can and can not be accessed and can even set up the site so that members are drip fed access to information over time rather than all at once.Setting up payment gateways with PayPal or Stripe is easy to do with MemberPress , as is the configuration of your membership <h> 2 . Paid Memberships Pro <p> Paid Memberships Pro is available free from the WordPress repository and is a powerful plugin that enables you to create a wide range of different membership sites . It has a ton of great features and despite being free , comes with more add-ons and provides superior integration with other plugins than MemberPress . <p> Paid Memberships Pro is completely free but access to its support and forums is paid for .

It comes as no surprise that it has now produced a specialised WooCommerce Memberships plugin . <p> As you would expect from a company with this level of expertise , the WooCommerce Membership plugin is extremely powerful and versatile . It 's wide range of functions , however , wo n't make it the easiest plugin to set up " there will be quite a lot of options to work through . And at $149 , it 's not the cheapest option , either " and that only includes one year of updates and support . <p> For more details about the plugin , see the video below : <h> 4 . Membership 2 <p> Membership 2 is a membership plugin from another highly-regarded WordPress plugin company , WPMU Dev. - Whilst not as all-encompassing as the WooCommerce Membership plugin , it does have a very good range of options and functions and is less difficult to set up . <p> The plugin is free from the WordPress repository but there is also a pro version available from WMPU " however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pro plugin for free if you pay to become a member . - See the video below for more information . <h> Conclusion <p> Membership sites can be a great way to earn a living on the internet . However , before you start to create one , you do need content that people will pay for . If you already run a successful blog , for example , you may be able to convert your current content into a members ' only area . A good membership site will also keep its content updated , otherwise members wo n't renew their subscriptions . <p> The other thing you need to take into consideration is that membership websites can be resource intensive . This means you should choose a hosting package that can provide the resources needed to keep a busy site functioning well . If you are expecting to be busy , you may need dedicated WordPress hosting or VPS hosting . If you have a site with heavy traffic and which runs large applications , then you may need either a dedicated serveror cloud hosting . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership sites of all sizes , check out the hosting pages linked to above or contact us on 0800 862 0380 .

@@14548977 @3148977/ <h> What is Microsoft Hyper-V technology and how it works ? <p> 27-08-2015 , 09:35 <p> Virtualisation is the base of all the leading technology because of flexibility and advantages it has become the integral part of our daily tech life . Honestly , not many are aware of its importance and want to know what is hyper v technology used for ? I have tried to incorporate and give a detailed explanation on what virtualisation is and how it works . You will understand Microsoft Hyper-V technology and examine it by performing the initial steps of VM configuration : Installation and virtual machine deployment . <p> Let 's understand first , What is Virtualisation ? <p> Virtualisation is the instance of a virtual version of an IT environment ( actually not available physically ) , with an operating system ( OS ) , a storage device and many more . Virtualisation takes place on the same hardware platform after installing specific software - hypervisor . It is a supplementary layer between physical and virtual spheres . It oversees the systems hardware resources so they are distributed efficiently among virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VM load and assigned system policy , system resources provided for Virtual Machines ( VMs ) , and the hypervisor makes this distribution flexible and even limited from time-to-time . The third party software , which is installed and used by users , runs on the VM as though its running directly on the physical hardware . Both the application and the end user may be unaware that they are working within a virtual sphere . <p> According to an ICT survey , nearly 45% of companies are interested in virtualisation because , <p> It is affordable because it reduces the number of required servers . <p> Easy to manage and control , Inspection of VMs much easier than with traditional web hosting servers . <p> What is Microsoft Hyper-V ? Microsoft has started the virtualisation era with Hyper-V and it was the first Virtualisation platform introduced in 2008 . After enormous success , the company has continued to release new Hyper-V versions with new Windows server versions . Today there are four versions available , including Windows Server 2012 R2 , Windows Server 2012 , Windows Server 2008 R2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has constantly been a Windows Server feature , which could be established whenever a server administrator decided to act so . Its also available as a separate product called Microsoft Hyper-V Server . Essentially , Microsoft Hyper-V Server is a standalone and shortened edition of Windows Server where Microsoft cuts out everything irrelevant to Virtualisation , services and Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) to establish the server as small as possible . Plus , without the bells and whistles , the server needs less maintenance time and it is less vulnerable , because , for instance , fewer components mean less patching . <p> Hyper-V is a hybrid hypervisor , which is set up from the OS ( via Windows wizard of adding roles ) . Nevertheless , during installation it redesigns the OS architecture and becomes just like a next layer of the physical hardware ( Please refer image ) . <p> How to Install Hyper-V ? It is simple to install but make sure before installation starts check which Windows OS version , you have . It needs to be Windows Server OS and newer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Server Manager , and then perform the installation by following the wizard . For Windows 8/8.1 , check Windows 8 versions comparison , to make sure your current OS license allows you to deploy Hyper-V . <p> Important Note : If you are running a Windows version older than 2008 , you will need to upgrade to a newer version before you can proceed . <p> After the successful installation , the computer will reboot one time and you will notice additional services have been installed with the Hyper-V Manager . Now go to the Control Panel - Administration - Hyper-V Manager to know what you can do with this installation . <p> How does it work ? Please look at the below image to know all Hyper-V management operations available from Hyper-V Manager . <p> Since Hyper-V role has integrated into the Server Manager tool , you can see more or less useful information in that location by watching the events and services related to Hyper-V and see recommended configurations , projects , best practices , and online resources . <p> With Hyper-V Manager , you can create , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional dependent operations . Now its all clear so Let 's create one test VM . Right-click on the server node in the main window , Click to New , and select Virtual Machine and you will see the new Virtual Machine starting . <p> Please enter a name for the new VM and allocate the right place store it , by default system disk is the location and now specify and allocate the amount of required memory . <p> Create virtual disk space by selecting a network adapter for VM and then define the medium through ( CD/DVD-ROM or . ISO image on a hard disk ) which you want the operating system to install on new VM . Now click Finish and your VM would be ready ! <p> It is better to check if the new instance of VM is working or not right-click on the name of the virtual machine and then click Connect . Once the Virtual Machine has initialized , the OS installation should start automatically .

Are you baffled by redundancy ' ? And when your IT consultant mentions your RPO do you just grunt and nod your head knowingly , when really you do n't have a clue ? You 're not on your own . <p> When it comes to disaster recovery terminology many small business owners and employees are left in the dark . But you need to rectify this . Your company relies on its IT system to be able to operate ; for that reason , creating a disaster recovery plan is a necessity " and you ca n't do this properly until you know what you are talking about . So , to help , this article will explain some of the key terms and acronyms used in disaster recovery planning . <h> Core Terms <h> Disaster <p> You ca n't begin to have a discussion about disaster recovery until you know what a disaster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system goes down . This can include your website going offline , the loss of email , your manufacturing software not working , or any other critical application ceasing to operate . <p> The causes are as numerous as the problems they create : hacking , faulty wiring , fire , flood , a corrupted hard drive , software conflict or human error . <h> Disaster Recovery <p> Frequently referred to using the acronym DR , disaster recovery is the process of getting your system fully working again . This involves restoring your data , IT equipment , software applications and any other technical resources on which your operations depend . <h> Disaster Recovery Plan <p> Unsurprisingly referred to in the trade as a DRP , a disaster recovery plan is a highly detailed plan of action to get your system back online if it goes down . It should give full details of who does what , when , why and how as well as containing all necessary documentation , lists of equipment needed and where to find it . For a full understanding of what 's required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disaster Recovery Plan . ' <p> Other disaster recovery terminology " in alphabetical order- - <h> Application Recovery <p> Application recovery is the process of restoring your business system software and data . This is done after restoring your hardware and operating system . <h> Business Continuity <p> Your disaster recovery plan should be an element of an overarching business continuity plan . Business continuity looks at how you continue to keep your business operating in any disruptive situation , whether that 's a system failure , industrial action , severe weather or anything else . <h> Business Impact Analysis <p> In order to make informed decisions when drafting your disaster recovery plan , you need to have a thorough understanding of how a disaster will impact upon your business . Undertaking a business impact analysis will help you prioritise the different applications you need to bring back online and give you an idea of how long you can afford to be offline for . It will also help you develop contingency plans for business continuity whilst disaster recovery is taking place . <h> Disaster Recovery Site <p> A disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is essentially a replica of your data centre , containing backup hardware , applications and data that can be brought in action if your data centre can not function . See item 10 : Hot Sites , Cold Sites and Warm Sites . <h> Disaster Recovery Team <p> This is the team of individuals who are responsible for bringing your system back online . Every member should be listed in your DRP , together with their contact details and each one should have a clearly defined role . The team may include both internal and external members , so besides employees , you may have software developers , web host technical support and other consultants . <h> High Availability <p> In simple terms , high availability refers to a system that is capable of staying online for most of the time . By most of the time , we mean that for 99.99% of the time and above , the system will continue to process and function . High availability can be achieved by using redundant components which can be brought into service if there is a failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to utilise cloud hosting . <h> Hot Sites , Warm Sites and Cold Sites <p> Disaster recovery sites come in three different forms , hot sites , warm sites and cold sites . Here 's an explanation of what they are so you can see the differences between them . <h> Hot Sites <p> A hot site is essentially a fully operational replica of your data centre that , in the event of a disaster , you can switch your operations to in order to prevent your mission critical services going offline . It is the best method for ensuring business continuity but as you have to keep the centre up and running it is also the most expensive . A more cost effective solution can be achieved by creating a cloud-based hot site which can utilise pay as you go , scalable resources in the event of a disaster . <h> Warm Sites <p> A warm site is one where you have hardware installed and preconfigured in case of a disaster , but to keep costs down you do not install software or data . In the event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed before recovery can be completed . Again , a cloud-based warm site can be a more cost-efficient solution . <h> - Cold Sites <p> A cold site is basically just a data centre enabled space , providing power , network connectivity , air conditioning , telephone lines , etc . In the case of a disaster , you would need to install the hardware , software and data before recovery could take place . It 's the cheapest solution , but the one that would take the longest to bring back online . <h> Mission Critical <p> One of the most bandied about terms in IT phraseology , mission critical ' refers to an application that , without which , your business would not able to function . Think of TomTom losing GPS , Heathrow losing air traffic control or Amazon losing its payment facilities . <h> Recovery Time Objective ( RTO ) <p> One of the key things you should find out from your business impact analysis is how long your business can realistically accept its applications being offline . From this , you can then set your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you will allow for disaster recovery to take place . Obviously , the quicker you can recover , the sooner you can be back in business , but this may have an impact on your Recovery Point Objective ( see below ) . <h> Recovery Point Objective ( RPO ) <p> If you are familiar with a PC or a laptop , the best way to understand Recovery Point Objective is to think about it in the same way as a system restore point . RPO is about restoring your system and , in particular , its data , exactly as it was at a certain point in time . <p> From your business impact analysis , you should have a good understanding of the point in time you need to restore too . For example , if you are an e-commerce business you may need to restore right up to the moment that your website went offline in order not to lose track of any orders that were taken . <p> Knowing what your needs are and setting your RPO will affect two important things , firstly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly on your RTO . This is because , if you need to restore all the way up to the moment of disaster , you will have to have constant backups taking place and this is likely to increase the amount of time you need to fully restore your system . <h> Redundancy <p> Redundancy , in IT terminology , means having unused resources at your disposal that you can put into operation when the need requires , such as servers or disk space . For disaster recovery , it means having these resources in place so that you can either prevent failure happening altogether or have the means to recover very quickly . <p> Unfortunately , redundancy can also be what happens to employees of companies that do n't have a disaster recovery plan . Do n't let this happen to you ! <h> Conclusion <p> Hopefully , from reading this article , you will now have a better understanding of the disaster recovery jargon and acronyms used in the IT industry . <p> If you are looking for a cost-efficient way to meet your disaster recovery objectives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . <h> Small Business Guide to Network Security Planning <p> Businesses rely on their networks for their most critical operations and with so much at risk , especially with the increase in cyberattacks , it 's essential you have a comprehensive plan in place for ...

@@14548982 @3148982/ <h> What is CodeIgniter , and how does it work ? <h> What is CodeIgniter , and how does it work ? <h> What is CodeIgniter ? <p> CodeIgniter is a free , open-source , easy-to-use , object-oriented PHP web application framework , providing a ready-to-use library to use with your own PHP applications . For example , there is a Database API to make it easier and more convenient to execute SQL queries , such as SELECT , UPDATE , DELETE , INSERT , etc. , without having to create a lot of repetitive code yourself . This is how an application framework is useful in application development . <h> CodeIgniter is object-oriented <p> Using CodeIgniter requiring knowledge of using the object-oriented programming technique in order to be able to use CodeIgniter effectively , and to understand what happens when you are using certain features in CodeIgniter . <h> But , what is object-oriented programming ? <p> Its quite difficult to explain object-oriented programming because from a conceptual point of view , it is difficult to understand . However , the main purpose of object-oriented programming is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with large structures . Object-oriented programming allows application code and logic to be easier to understand , structured and coherently in place , making it easier to develop and extend your applications features and functionality . With procedural programming ( which is merely standard code executed line-by-line with the use of functions as a container for code that help prevent repetitiveness and " reinventing the wheel " ) , applications can become a mess if they are n't  developed in a way where everything is well laid out , coherent and structured , and can be more difficult to extend and add new features and functionality to your applications later on . With object-oriented programming , in a way , you are forced to be coherent and have your code structured correctly . <h> Classes and Methods <p> What are classes and methods ? These are the first concepts you 'll be introduced to if you are learning object-oriented programming from most books or online resources . Say you 're creating a framework . Youll have different classes- for different parts of your framework . One being a " Database Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . Of course , in this case , the Database Class is like the CodeIgniter Database Class , providing a set of ready-made methods for you to use so you do n't  have to create them yourself in order to execute certain application logic , such as inserting , updating and removing database records quickly , without having to " reinvent the wheel " . <p> The methods- are what contain the application logic , and the class- merely holds many related methods together . And this is exactly how your applications would work with the use of the object-oriented programming techniques . <h> Classes <p> Classes contain a collection of methods and properties ( properties are essentially variables in an object-oriented context ) . <p> For example , here is an example using the Database library within CodeIgniter : <p> **26;847;TOOLONG , $data ) ; <p> In any application you make using CodeIgniter , your own classes inherit ( or extends ) the CodeIgniter class , and so this is why the $this- variable is used , which refers to the current class/object . So to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $this-&gt;methodname() . <h> Helpers <h> Other interesting features of CodeIgniter <p> While this is by no means unique to CodeIgniter , and other web application frameworks use this approach to application development , CodeIgniter primarily uses the Model , View , Controller- ( MVC ) approach to application design and development . It essentially separates application logic from the application design/view . The application logic is the Controller , whereas the application design/view is the View . The Model- is for database interactions . There are more complex scenarios where the MVC approach is used , but for basic to intermediate CodeIgniter applications , the Model- would contain database interactivity logic of sorts . <h> Active Record <p> When you saw an example of using the Database Class above , that code is actually part of the Active Record Class that is part of the Database library . <p> Active Record is where your work can be shortened by providing an easy and convenient way to execute certain SQL queries without having to write out the entire SQL query yourself .

One of the most important factors in search engine optimization is the title of the web page . The title of the page is the first SEO element examined by the search engine crawler as it visits your website . The search engine ranking of your web page also depends upon the title of the page . So , take extra care in deciding the title . The title should also include your best keyword or key phrase that is related to the content of the page . <p> You will need to consider many factors while deciding the page title . Some of these important factors that will help you in deciding a great page title are as follows : <p> The page title should include the keyword or keywords used as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , the page title should describe the main theme of the web page . Do n't  use your companys name in the title , unless the companys name is extremely popular . <p> The keyword or key phrase should be able to convey the content of your page in short . If these keywords are popular , then it will be typed into the search engines more frequently by the Web searchers . If your Web page is ranked higher in the search engines , especially in the top 30 , then the search can easily visit your page . <p> Avoid stuffing of keywords in the page title and also in the content . Search engines will definitely ban your site or will not include your webpage in their databases , as such stuffing is considered as keyword spamming . <p> Remember that just using great title for your web page is not sufficient .

So , limiting the page title to 40 characters or less is a good SEO strategy . <p> To get more attention from the readers , you can use the special characters like the parentheses ( ) , arrows &lt; &gt; , the hash symbol # , the double hyphen - , asterisks , dollar signs $ , et cetera . These special characters usually do not obstruct your SEO efforts . On the contrary , they attract the viewer 's attention your title . <p> Some search engines still like to see our title tag in your Web page HTML . So , include title tags so that your webpages will rank higher in these search engines . <p> The proper place to add a title tag is the Head section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloaded in the browser , this title tag is displayed in the title bar of the Web browser . Each web page should have its own title that is absolutely related to the web pages content . <p> Please note that the title tag should not be repeated in the HTML code , i.e. , you should use the title tag only once . Also , each title tag should not contain a keyword more than 3 times . Some people repeat title tag many times thinking that repeating the title tag will give more advantage in their SEO effort , but the search engines will immediately punish this for spamming . <p> Title tags are different from the Meta tags , yet the Title tags can influence the search engines greatly if they are used correctly as mentioned above .

According to research from IPSE , 1.8 million people now work as a freelancer in the UK , that 's a rise of 36% since 2008 . People are attracted to freelancing for lots of reasons : it gives them greater flexibility over the work they do ; they can have a better work-life balance ; and it can be a good way to get out of a corporate environment . If you are considering becoming a freelancer , this post will give you some tips to make sure you get off to the best start . <h> 1 . Choose the right business type <p> When you start working as a freelancer you are setting up a business . However , from a legal and tax point of view , there are different types of business you can set up and it is important that you choose the right one . <p> For a freelancer who works on their own , there are two basic types of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pros and cons . Limited companies offer distinct tax advantages and protect you from personal financial losses , however , they have more legal responsibilities and require much more work when it comes to completing financial accounts . Sole-traders only have streamlined financial obligations in comparison but do lose the tax advantages . They also risk their homes and possessions if the company can not afford to pay its creditors . For more information visit the Gov.UK website. <h> 2 . Tell the taxman <p> When you set up as a freelancer , you are obliged to tell HMRC straight away . If you run a limited company , you have to pay yourself through PAYE and so will need to set up an account with HMRC to pay your tax and your National Insurance . <p> If you decide not to set up a limited company , you will need to register as a sole-trader . When you do this , you will receive a Unique Tax Reference ( UTR ) number and will have to register for self-assessment and Class-2 National Insurance contributions . <p> Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing accounts , completing tax assessments and even making payments , can be done online . However , it can be challenging and stressful if you do not know what you are doing . It is always advisable to seek professional advice from an accountant . If you run a limited company , your accounts must be completed by an accountant . <h> 3 . Get online accounting <p> You do n't just need records of your financial transactions for the HMRC , you also need them for yourself . It is vital that you have a complete picture of your business 's finances so that you know where you stand . Failure to do this can cause your freelancing business to run out of cash or even collapse altogether . <p> One of the best ways to keep your records up-to-date is to use accounting software , which is now widely available online . Websites like QuickBooks and Sage Online can make accounting very simple . They can connect with your business bank accounts , send invoices , create cash flow charts , and produce profit and loss accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This helps saves your time , effort , money and stress . <h> 4 . Get insurance <p> It does n't matter what business you run , you need to have insurance . Whilst you might be thinking about the need to insure your stock or your equipment , you must also think of liability insurance . If someone is injured through your work or if you cause damage to property of loss of income , you could be looking at a lawsuit worth millions of pounds. - Liability insurance can protect you against these . <p> Luckily , liability insurance can be relatively cheap ( unless you run a business with obvious risks , like a skydiving instructor ) and many providers now tailor their insurance packages for specific types of business . <h> 5 . Open a business bank account <p> Unless you run a limited company , there is no legal obligation to have a separate business account from your personal account . However , it can get very messy sorting out your business and personal finances from each other if you do not " especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax purposes . <p> At the same time , if you use the online accounting programs we mentioned above , you will need separate business and personal accounts as they analyse the payments in and out of your account to do many of their calculations " this is impossible to do when business accounts are not kept entirely separate . <p> Business accounts are usually charged for but costs are minimal and many are free in the first year of setting up your business . <h> 6 . Always have business cards handy <p> Business cards are an essential for every freelancer . Opportunities to get new clients arise at the most unlikely of times , often with chance encounters . Having a business card available means you can give someone your details there and then , without having to scribble your name and contact number down on the back of an envelope . <p> You can design your business cards online at sites like Vistaprint , and have them printed and delivered to your door . The prices are very reasonable . You can even design your own logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have website <p> One of the biggest advantages for many freelancers is that your business is n't limited by geographical boundaries . Much of the work freelancers do can be done online and this means that you have the potential to work with clients across the globe . Of course , to do this , it is important that you have an online presence where potential clients can find out all about your services , how much you charge and how to get in contact . <p> A website is essential , therefore , for freelancers working online " and setting one up has never been easier to do . You do n't need to go to the expense of having a website built for you , either .

There are two further types of VPS . They are : managed VPS hosting , which is more expensive than the unmanaged VPS hosting service . The VPS is essentially the economical bridge between the least expensive shared web hosting plan and the highly expensive dedicated web hosting plan . <p> There can be many VPS hosted on a single physical web server . The physical web server boots normally , and then uses a software to boot each VPS independently within a virtualization environment . The VPS has no direct access to the physical server 's hardware . The booting of VPS is done from a disk image . Almost all the web hosting companies offer the VPS plan to their customers . The managed hosting can be monitored and controlled using specific tools . <p> It is seen that most of the webmasters begin their website hosting on a shared web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a small fees compared to the more powerful Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) , Semi-dedicated hosting server , or the dedicated hosting server . It is rightly so , because in the beginning , these webmasters are just trying to establish themselves on this huge internet . <p> Once they have mastered the skills of making money online and the needs of their website grows exponentially , these webmasters then move their website on to the more powerful web servers to take advantage of the commercial aspects and the usage benefits of these very powerful web servers . <p> The earlier shared web hosting plans for these webmasters become limited in their commercial aspects and the usability benefits , as their business grows and the need for more disk space , higher monthly bandwidth , more control over their website , need to use better web applications , having high-end e-commerce applications , overall security aspects , and needing better web features demand their growing websites to be using the more features that the VPS and the dedicated web servers offer . <p> The above are the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dedicated web servers offer the best features for such growing websites , but the cost of operating the dedicated servers and maintaining their web applications poses more difficulties to these webmasters . The best option in this case is to choose the virtual private server , also called the VPS web hosting . The VPS not only saves them lots of money , but also gives them additional benefits of being very powerful compared to the shared web hosting plan , and gives them many of the dedicated web server 's advantages . <h> Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) <p> A virtual private server ( VPS ) or a virtual web hosting server is a physical web hosting server which is pro grammatically divided into a number of sections . All these sections are virtual machines which act as a separate dedicated server for its user . These partitions are independent in the sense that every VPS using the physical server acts independently without risking any other partition , or the VPS present on that physical web server . All the resources like the physical RAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU ) , disk space , and other such resources are not shared with other VPS present on that physical server . Even the operating system and its configurations can be used by each VPS user in different ways , as they may suit them . <p> The virtual web server can provide very flexible and convenient usage for the webmaster <p> Other additional web applications can be easily used by the VPS <p> Each VPS can be independently rebooted <p> Every VPS has its own operating system <p> Every VPS has its own copy of the operating service .

The resources used by each VPS on the physical web server can be centrally controlled by the web host <p> Most VPS use the Linux-based operating system which has proven track-record of being more stable and secure than the more expensive Windows-based operating system <p> VPS can allow the webmaster to host numerous websites very efficiently <p> A VPS account will usually come with more services and tools from your web host " much more than what is offered with the shared web hosting service <p> As the VPS is isolated from other websites , that is , the VPS does not interact with other websites present on the physical server , the security aspect of a VPS is much stronger than the risky shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by another webmaster can harm your website <p> There are many more powerful features that a VPS can offer you over the shared web hosting server <p> Disadvantages Of Using The Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) <p> There are also many other disadvantages associated with using the VPS . They are : <p> The webmaster must possess high-proficiency in using the VPS to control the working of the website , the applications used , and the server resources skillfully <p> As the VPS usually uses many web applications like the forums , chatting softwares , e-commerce forms , and other secure applications , if the webmaster is unable to control these applications professionally , they can become unmanageable because of the high traffic that they attract <p> The hardware resources of the physical web server are still shared by the many websites that use the server , so your VPS may not be able to use maximum amount of RAM , disk space ( although disk space problems can be more easily handled by replacing with a bigger hard-disk ) <p> The above facts ascertain the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so more responsibility is also needed to control such powerful system .

So , if your website really needs more powers and features than the shared web hosting server , and if your website is not a very critically important e-commerce website , then opt for the VPS . <p> The VPS is quite economical and efficient , and offers excellent benefits for your website .

SEO covers a wide range of things , including the speed of your website , the way you structure your content and the way you use keywords on your site .

I know ASP does n't serve up the web.config file if requested , but I still wanted to encrypt it for extra security . <p> Unfortunately , it does n't seem to work on my hosting as I get the message : <p> " Failed to decrypt using provider ' **33;875;TOOLONG ' . Error message from the provider : The RSA key container could not be opened . " <p> To encrypt configuration information in ASP.NET 2.0 , keep the following things in your mind : <p> All forms of encryption involve some sort of secret that is used when encrypting and decrypting the data . Symmetric encryption algorithm use the same secret key in both encrypting and decrypting a message , whereas asymmetric encryption algorithms use different keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , the encryption scheme is only as safe as the secret key for decrypting . <p> The configuration encryption capabilities in ASP.NET 2.0 are designed to foil a hacker who somehow is able to retrieve your configuration files . The idea is that if the hacker has your Web.config file on his computer , she ca n't de-scramble the encrypted sections . However , when an ASP.NET page on the web server requests information from an encrypted configuration file , the data must be decrypted to be used ( and this happens without you needing to write any code ) . Therefore , if a hacker is able to upload an ASP.NET web page to your system that queries the configuration file and displays its results , she can view the encrypted settings in plain-text . ( There 's an example ASP.NET page that can be downloaded at the end of this article that illustrates encrypting and decrypting various sections of the Web.config file ; as you 'll see , an ASP.NET page can access ( and display ) the plain-text version of the encrypted data . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which allows for any implementation to be seamlessly plugged into the API . The . NET Framework 2.0 ships with two built-in providers for protecting configuration sections : <p> * The Windows Data Protection API ( DPAPI ) Provider ( **35;910;TOOLONG ) : this provider uses the built-in cryptography capabilities of Windows to encrypt and decrypt the configuration sections . By default this provider uses the machine 's key . You can also use user keys , but that requires a bit more customization . Since the keys are machine- or user- specific , the DPAPI provider does not work in settings where you want to deploy the same encrypted configuration file to multiple servers . <p> * RSA Protected Configuration Provider ( **33;947;TOOLONG ) : uses RSA public key encryption to encrypt/decrypt the configuration sections . With this provider you need to create key containers that hold the public and private keys used for encrypting and decrypting the configuration information . You can use RSA in a multi-server scenario by creating exportable key containers . <p> There 's one more option on encrypting the configuration information in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through this link for more info on this type of encryption : LONG ... <p> Once the data is encrypted , when it 's read from an ASP.NET page ( i.e. , reading the connection string information from a SqlDataSource control or programmatically , via LONG ... ASP.NET automatically decrypts the connection string and returns the plain-text value . In other words , you do n't need to change your code one iota after implementing encryption . Best of Luck:smile : <h> Comment <p> I 've written a page that has 2 buttons - 1 to encrypt and 1 to decrypt ( using RSA ) . When I click the encrypt button , it responds configuration file appropriately . <p> I 'm guessing this is because the server does n't have write permission to the config file ( I had to grant appropriate rights to the ASPNET account on my local PC before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and I ca n't upload the web.config from the local PC because I ca n't register the local key on my hosting . <h> Comment <p> I am afraid , it would not be possible to encrypt the connection string in the web.config on a shared server owing to the number of commands that will be needed to run on the server level to encrypt the web.config settings and the server will not be able to read the already encrypted string without the RSA . It also would not be possible to export client 's RSA on the server to make this happen or provide servers RSA for security reasons .

Ca n't wait to build the website and get started ? Then stop for a few minutes and read this article , it could just stop you making a big mistake . Before you rush into any decisions about what kind of business you are going to launch , it 's important that you fully understand the nature of the online market . In this article , we 'll explain why you need to choose a specific niche for your business and how to find out which niche is going to offer you a viable market . <h> Why you need to identify a niche <p> The internet is a highly competitive marketplace . There are millions of businesses selling products and services of every conceivable kind . Many of these businesses are extremely well established and have a firm grip on their markets . They have the buying power to get hold of products cheaply , the logistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure everyone knows about them . If you are thinking of competing against these kinds of businesses , your company is unlikely to succeed . <p> To be able to start a successful online business , you need to identify a niche where there is a demand for a product or service ; but there are few , if any , online businesses servicing the needs of those customers . <p> One of the problems with identifying a viable niche market is that many of them have already been swamped by suppliers . Increasingly , those starting new online businesses are either focusing on selling brand new products and services , ( frequently from the technology sector ) or building their businesses around what are known as micro-niches ' . - For example , if the market sector was insurance , niches would be insurance for home , car , life , travel , breakdown and pets . A micro-niche would focus on something very specific like wedding insurance or identity theft insurance . Companies like Rias and Saga , for example , specialise in over 50 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One of the best ways to succeed is to find a niche before it becomes firmly established .

Getting in the market early will enable you to become a key player before other competitors jump on the bandwagon . <h> Advantages of finding a niche <p> There are many advantages to finding a small but lucrative niche . One of the main ones is that your company will be seen as a specialist . Being a specialist means that customers tend to think you are an expert in your field and , because of this , they make you their first port of call and are willing to pay more for your products and services . One excellent example of this is Clarks , the shoe retailer , which , for decades , has been seen as the expert for children 's shoes .

Inputting these will allow Google to show you the relevant data . <p> Above is the data for the term school shoes . ' This shows that the number of monthly searches ranges from 18,000 to 110,000 with an average of 33,100 searches a month .

This would indicate a niche where there is sufficient demand and room for a new business to establish itself . <p> The other tool you can use is Google Trends - inputting your keywords into this tool will help you understand whether the products and services you are thinking of selling are becoming more or less popular over the years . As you can see below , there has been a year by year increase of people searching for school shoes ' online . <p> Normally , you should avoid selling products or services which are in decline as it could signal the end of a product 's life-cycle or that a product or service has become obsolete . However , for some niche online businesses , this can be more of an opportunity that a threat . There are still people out there buying and selling VHS and Betamax videos and non-digital cameras .

To ensure you find a suitable niche , you will need to fully research your market , its trends and your competitors . <p> In essence , if you are looking for a good niche , think about becoming specialised ; do n't be a cake maker , be a gluten free cake maker , - instead of selling golf clubs , sell left handed golf clubs , if you 're setting up a cleaning service , be an eco-friendly cleaner and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a specialist company like yours . @qwx190776 @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> 6 Ways to Increase Google AdWords Conversions <p> For many businesses , Google AdWords is a vital marketing tool .

Whilst dedicated servers can be clustered together to provide more power , in most cases this is n't without its downtime , not to mention it being very time consuming and laborious as it requires somebody to place the server in the rack and network it at the data centre end . The benefit of the cloud is that virtual machines and resources can be called upon at short notice and remotely , letting you provision a new segment of your infrastructure in just a few clicks at any time of day .

Load balancing uses one server as the load balancer , which in turn distributes the traffic that it receives between the other servers in the cluster so that a single server never becomes overwhelmed with the load . As a concept , load balancing works very well because additional servers can be added to the cluster to cope with the load without affecting the servers that already form the environment . There are a number of cloud platforms available that let customers create virtualised load balanced clusters , providing them with another way in which they can virtualise their current physical infrastructure . <h> Automatic scaling <p> A number of cloud platforms , such as eNlight , feature autoscaling .

But if you encrypt your site with an SSL certificate , you form a secure connection between your site and your customers/visitors .

Just like out of date antivirus software leaves you open to threats , so will any out of date or improperly configured security software . If you want to check that your security settings are up to date and working the way that they should , there are plenty of online tools that will give you an analysis of your site . I 'm sure there are tools to remove the viruses Priya , but easily and effectively is another matter . And it makes a lot more sense to just secure a website to begin with and avoid the hassle of having to remove viruses .

Poor pronunciation hinders job performance , creates stress , and reduces productivity . <p> 3 ) When the focus is on how the employee speaks , as opposed to what is being said , communication breaks down . This can be very costly to our company ! <p> 1 ) VOICE MODULATION <p> Speakers of every single language in the world have a characteristic way of holding their vocal tract during speech . This has nothing to do with the individual sounds of the language or intonation but with the basic resting position the speech organs-your tongue , your lips , your jaw , your throat . <p> Even if your pronunciation of each sound is perfect- if you do not hold your speech organs the same way that native speakers do- you will sound foreign . This is due to the fact that the mouth cavity is like the body of a musical instrument-its where all the sounds of the language resonate just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is why a violin sounds like a violin and a piano sounds like a piano even when they are playing the exact same note . <p> Two instruments playing the exact same note sound very different because of the way sound resonates in the body of the instrument . When it comes to accent , your mouth cavity is like a musical instruments body ! You must hold your mouth like an American to sound American ! <p> This is incredibly important . If you hold your vocal tract the wrong way it creates the wrong vibrations and you will wind up sounding like a banjo or a flute when you are trying to sound like a guitar . In other words , your consonants and vowels will sound German or Spanish or Chinese even if they are otherwise being pronounced correctly <p> Relax ! So what is the American way to hold your vocal tract ? First and foremost you must be relaxed ! There should be very little tension in your mouth , jaw , lips , and throat . The flat of your tongue should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of the tongue sitting behind the back teeth . Your lips should neither be rounded nor spread too wide , and they should be slightly parted . Again , unlike many languages , even unlike British English , the key here is to have RELAXED vocal organs . If you do not , you will simply not sound American no matter how good the rest of your accent is . So release the tension from your mouth and try to speak in a very casual laid back manner . Do n't  worry about going overboard-its much better to be too relaxed than too tense when speaking American English . <p> Some Good News ! Even if you change nothing else in your accent , learning to relax your vocal organs and pronounce words from the head , not the chest , will make you sound far more American in no time . Its easy if you just practice relaxing , and it will make a big difference in your accent FAST ! <p> BONUS TIP ! One unusual but effective way to improve your accent is to copy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American accent . This will train you to recognize what really makes an American sound American . Then , try to apply the same patterns when you actually speak English ! It works ! <p> 2 ) WORD CONNECTIONS . <p> The next most important tip to remember in speaking English like an American has to do with word connections . <p> Teachers of English as a second language usually instruct their students to speak English much too precisely and to pronounce every word carefully the way it would be pronounced if it were said alone in isolation . But this is not at all how Americans sound when speaking ! In fact , they run words together in their sentence all the time . And if you do not do this too , you will sound choppy and foreign even if you are pronouncing each individual word correctly . Its not sloppy , its the way Americans talk . This is a very hard thing for most learners of English-and even most English teachers-to accept . They think they are speaking badly because they are speaking very casually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is exactly what you must do to sound like an American and not like a robot ! <p> The dog is cute and cuddly . <p> Now , read the sentence aloud . <p> How did it sound ? Most likely you pronounced each word individually : <p> **26;1039;TOOLONG . <p> Even if you did n't  actually pause between them , this still sounds very unnatural to an American because you are not connecting the words but speaking each as it has been written . connect their words in speech . This is incredibly important in order to sound like a native speaker . <p> How exactly do they do this ? Well , when a word that ends with a consonant ( like the final g in dog ) , is immediately followed by a word that begins with a vowel ( like the initial i in is ) it is normal for that final consonant to be pronounced as if it actually began the following word rather than ended the previous one . So , Americans , do n't  say : <p> DOG#IS <p> but rather : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do n't  say : <p> CUTE#AND <p> but instead say : <p> CU TAND . <p> So the sentence should be read : <p> THE DO GIS CU TAND CUDDLY . <p> 1 ) American : I 'll letchya know <p> 2 ) Indian : I will let you know <p> Notice that the word cute does in fact end in the consonant t sound-the e is just there in spelling-so the t is indeed pronounced as part of AND . <p> REMEMBER ! You are concerned with the actual sounds of a word not the spelling ! As you have certainly discovered , English spelling is not always a good indicator of pronunciation ! <p> The important point here is that if you do not use word connections such as this properly you will sounds like different . This is a very common problem for speakers of many languages . <p> Do n't  do it like this ! <p> Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies , with Uncle Henry , who was a farmer , and Aunt Em , who was the farmers wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build it had to be carried by wagon many miles .

The most important of these are called the core ranking factors ' . To be successful on Google , it is important that you know what these factors are and that your site is optimised for them . This post will identify the six main core ranking factors and show you what actions you need to take when optimising your website. <h> 1 . Create high-quality content <p> At the top of Google 's list of criteria is high-quality content . For Google to remain the world 's leading search engine , the search results it provides have to be seen as useful by its users . If it sends people to sites with low-quality content , users will abandon it in favour of Bing and Yahoo and it will lose billions in revenue . For this reason , sites with high-quality content will always get ranked higher than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's difficult for it to judge what is or is n't high-quality content . As the decision is made by an algorithm and not a team of expert human readers , the only way for Google to find quality content is to take a range of other factors into consideration . These include : <p> The authority of the domain " . edu and . gov domains rank very highly . <p> The number of links to specific pages from other high ranking sites . <p> The number of social shares the page has . <p> The quality of other pages on the site . <p> The amount of time people spend on the page " the higher , the better . <p> The page 's bounce rates " the lower , the better . <p> To Google , many of these factors indicate that previous users have found the page useful and so it is likely to have content which is of high quality . Do note , that the focus here is on individual pages . Google will rank each of your pages separately . Some may rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of each individual page . For more information , read our post : High-Quality Content : The Future of SEO <h> 2 . Optimised keywords <p> Keywords optimisation is still a core ranking factor as it is the appearance of these words in the URLs , page titles , text and meta descriptions which indicate the relevance of your content to a particular search query . <p> However , Google 's algorithm is a lot more sophisticated than most people think and is able to judge relevance through analysing what linguists call latent semantic keywords ' . What this means is that , after spotting the keywords in your text , the algorithm will then look for words which it expects to be associated with those keywords . <p> So , if someone was searching for the best way to boil an egg , not only would Google look for the words boil an egg ' in the URL , title , content and metas , it would also look for words such as pan , timer , egg cup , tasty , etc. , which would be associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant results such as a page with a title Book your holiday in less time than it would take to boil an egg ' . <p> If you want your site to rank highly , therefore , not only must you use the relevant keywords , you must also make sure that the latent semantic keywords ' are included in the content too . <h> 3 . Make your site easy for Google to crawl <p> Google can only rank your content if it knows it is there . It discovers new and updated content by crawling the internet and indexing what it finds . <p> Crawling is done by search bots which move from site to site and page to page using internal and external links . If your site is poorly structured , there may be sections of it which Google can not access and which , therefore , can not be indexed . This means they will not appear in search results . <p> To make your site easy for Google to crawl you need to do the following : <p> To have a chance at ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of device , including old phones with legacy network connections like 2G and 3G ( you 'll be surprised how many people still use these ) . <p> The best way to find out if your site is fast enough for Google is to test it using their PageSpeed Insights page . All you need to do is type in your homepage URL and you will be given a speed score for desktop and mobile page loading . You 'll also be shown a list of improvements you need to carry out to make your site faster . <h> 5 . Make your website responsive <p> Since 2014 , we have spent more time surfing the internet on phones and tablets than we do on computers , so , as far as Google is concerned , websites that are still not set up to work on different devices fail to offer a good experience . <p> To urge everyone to update their sites , Google added mobile-friendliness as one of its core ranking factors in 2015 , in what was then termed as Mobilegeddon ' . So , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be losing out in search engine results and you need to make changes as soon as possible . To check whether your site is responsive , use Google 's Mobile-Friendly Test . <h> 6 . Make your site trustworthy <p> There is no way that Google would ever want to put its users at risk by sending them to a website where they may get hacked or infected . This is why website security is now a core ranking factor . The more secure a site is , the more trustworthy Google sees it and the better chance it has of ranking higher . <p> How do you make your site trustworthy ? Here are some the most important ways : <p> Your company name , registration number , physical address and telephone number should be clearly visible on your site . <p> Terms and conditions , privacy policy and cookie policies should be available to read online . <p> Have well written , error free writing on your website . <p> Your website and email addresses should not be blacklisted . <p> Trusted sites often have links from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanned for vulnerabilities , infections and other weaknesses . <h> Conclusion <p> Ranking well on Google can have a massive impact on the success of your website and can transform your business .

Caching reduces both the load on the origin server as well as speeds up users ' online experience . There are two main types of caches namely browser caches which reside on the user 's computer and the other is proxy caches which are on the network and serve one or many users . <p> What is Google cache ? <p> Google Cache is nothing but a snapshot or a copy of a page stored by Google as a back-up . Google usually takes a snapshot of each page it examines and caches or stores that version as a back-up . The cached version is what Google uses to judge if a page is a good match for our query . Googles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can often access a pages cached version faster than the page itself . <p> Basically every result of our search includes a Cached link . Clicking on that link takes you to the Google cached version of that particular web page , instead of taking you to the current version of the page . <p> This is useful if the original page is unavailable because of any of the following reason : <p> * Internet congestion * A down , overloaded , or just slow website * The owners recently removing the page from the Web <p> Sometimes a site that requires registration or a subscription can access the cached version from that particular site . <p> You can always access pages cached version faster than the page itself as we all know that googles servers are typically much more faster than any web servers . <p> If you ever find that Google is returning a link to a page that appears to have little to do with your query , or if you can not find the information that you are looking for on the current version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cached version . <p> On other hand almost every site that you come across while using Google will definitely have the option of accessing the cached version right in there in the search result . You can click on " cached " to immediately get back to the last copy that Google had made of that particular page . <p> Google Cache is a great and neat solution if a web page that you want to browse is down or not available . If you 're visiting a site and it returns a 404 error message , you can either do a search on Google for that site by prefixing the cache : operator parameters to your search query , so your search query would be something like cache:Google <p> How To access Google Cache : <p> 1 ) Just go to Google Web Search text box and add the keyword cache : in front of the URL that you would like to see . Ex. cache:eukhost.com 2 ) There is " cached " link in each of the Google Web Search results , except for those web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or snapshot on them . If there is this " Cached " link , just click . With reference to Google Webmaster Tools Help on Remove a page or site from Googles search results , a web page will not be available in Google Cache database if it is not visible to search engine crawler . 3 ) In Google Chrome web browser , just use its Address bar as Google Web Search text box <p> Google Cache shows a page to be like as it was when Google last crawled it successfully , so it may be outdated . Google does n't store images , scripts and other embedded objects , but it tries to retrieve them from their original location . If the page is down , most of the external resources wo n't be accessible and the page will load slowly . <p> Reasons for using Google Cache ? <p> Google Cache can be used for various purposes few of which are as follows : <p> * To see the contents of the page ( if the original site is temporarily down ) * To see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page has been updated since the cache and no longer contains the information you need . Thus , if Google returns a link to a page that appears to have little to do with your actual query , or if you cant find the information you 're seeking on the current version of the page , take a look at the cached version ) * To access websites blocked in your country ( or requiring registration/ subscriptions ) * To more quickly access the information of a slow loading page . <p> If anyone of you already know this then please share your knowledge in same post .

Within a shared or reseller web hosting environment you are able to make use of dedicated IP addresses as you would in a dedicated web hosting environment ; this means that a shared web hosting plan is still appropriate for you if you wish to use an SSL certificate . <p> An eUKhost dedicated hosting plan , whether you choose VPS server hosting or a dedicated server , are accompanied with at least two dedicated IP addresses for your use . As many domain names require at least two nameservers , in a dedicated hosting environment you will be able to make use of a single server to provide you with both nameserver services .

When configuring the options for your virtual machines , you can choose to have as many IP addresses as you see as necessary assigned to your servers . With each VM having at least one dedicated IP address , you can treat each VM like an individual server with access being possible through Remote Desktop or SSH . <h> Dedicated IP Address <p> A dedicated IP address can be used for a number of different applications , with the main intent being to provide web developers with a more professional end product that customers will be able to appreciate . <p> The primary application for dedicated IP addresses is for webmasters that wish to use SSL certificates with their websites ; in order for an eUKhost SSL certificate to function properly , a website requires its own dedicated IP address so that the certificate can be applied as necessary .

Reverse DNS is a required configuration option for anyone developing a web application that is going to be sending emails as a majority of email servers will reject emails that originate from servers that do n't have rDNS configured . <h> Dedicated IP VPN <p> Larger businesses may require a VPN so that their external employees are able to connect to the internal company network and a dedicated server or VPS server with a dedicated IP address can be of assistance where this service is needed . <p> A Virtual Private Network hosted on a dedicated server will benefit businesses that wish to connect multiple sites together so that resources can be shared securely through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting as it will give all computers that require access one static address that they can then use to login to their business 's corporate network . <p> There are a variety of VPN daemons available that can be used on eUK Linux servers and eUK Windows servers . eUKhost 's 24+7 support team can assist with the installation and configuration of VPN servers where necessary .

Windows provides a platform on which you can use a number of different proprietary applications and services that are only available on this OS and this is the main driving force behind the demand for Windows hosting products ; example of this include websites developed using ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server databases . A dedicated server can provide you with a number of opportunities to customise your web hosting experience to meet your individual needs because you can adapt the resources and hardware that forms your dedicated server to form something that no other business is going to be using ; you may wish to choose a more powerful CPU so that your server is able to perform more calculations per minute or on the other hand additional hard drives in RAID configuration could be a necessity for you .

A number of changes and updates have been introduced to the Hyper-V platform , a feature that is used widely by web hosting companies and corporations for the hosting of virtual machines on a Windows-based infrastructure ; you can expect to see limitations on VM resources being removed whilst network virtualization and cloud backup are two of the new features to be added .

Some may argue that managing a Windows server through RDP ( Remote Desktop Protocol ) is a simpler task for beginners to pick up because they will be using a simpler and more familiar interface , but the command-based nature of the Linux server is often seen as being most effective because it allows you to get the task in hand completed in a much more targeted manner . <h> Connecting from a Client Computer <p> The Remote Desktop client is a default feature of the Windows desktop operating system for a number of generations now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often located under Programs/All Programs on the Start menu . The Remote Desktop client is necessary to facilitate a connection between your desktop and Windows dedicated server using the RDP .

Unfortunately if you are a Linux desktop user then you wo n't be able to access a Windows dedicated server because there is no RDP client available , but Mac OSX users can take advantage of the free client that is available for download from the Microsoft website.

Your website 's performance , reliability , security and many of its background features are controlled by your host and so making the wrong choice could have disastrous consequences . So , to make sure you know exactly what to look for , we 've put together a list of sixteen essential things businesses need from a web host . <h> You need expert technical support <p> There will always be times when website owners , even ones with their own dedicated IT departments , come across issues they can not resolve on their own . When this happens , you need a web host with the expertise to provide the right solution . <p> This has become increasingly more important as businesses begin to move their entire IT infrastructure into the cloud . If you are running large , complex systems and using highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that when a glitch happens , your web host can put it right " and quickly . <h> 24-hour support <p> Besides expertise , you also want your web host 's customer support to be available 24 hours a day . As your online business operates 24/7 , you ca n't afford to wait until the next morning if your website goes down or your email system stops working . Every minute you 're offline could cost you a sale or create a dissatisfied customer . A good web host should provide constant , high-level support whenever you need it . <h> Backups <p> Backups are an essential part of any disaster recovery operation and it is crucial that your host provides the facility for you to schedule backups of all your data . This includes making sure that your backups are stored remotely on different servers to the ones on which your site is hosted . <p> Failure to back up your data can have enormous consequences " it can result in the loss of all your customer information , the entire contents of your website and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you can add to this the cost of rebuilding your site and the reputational damage caused by the downtime . If a web host does n't provide a backup service , then it 's too risky to go with that host . <h> Webhost backups <p> In addition to being able to backup your own data , you also want to know that your web host is backing up their servers too . If one of the servers goes down you need to know that they have their own backup ( and backup backups ) available and that they have tested the backup to make sure it works . This way you know that all the software the host needs to run the server , as well as all the data stored on it , can be put back online quickly . <h> Guaranteed uptime <p> The shift to cloud technology is making it far less likely that websites will go offline should there be a server fault , however , for those who are have not chosen cloud hosting , a server going down can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a host that has mirrored servers running at different locations so that if one goes down , the others will continue to maintain a service . This way , your site can always remain online . <p> Before choosing a host , you should check out what their customers say about their uptime reputations . <h> Security options <p> Website hacking is constantly in the headlines and the number of attacks on business websites of all kinds continues to rise . In this environment , it is crucial that you choose a web host that can provide a range of security features to protect your site . Look for hosts that will scan your site for malware and vulnerabilities and can detect and protect against intrusion . In addition , you also want email scanning and spam removal , SSL certificates and remote backups . <h> WordPress support <p> WordPress is the world 's most popular platform for building websites and although exceptionally versatile it has a few unique requirements that not all web hosts fully cater for . <p> Even if you are not currently using WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a web host who has WordPress expertise " you may decide to create a WordPress website in the future or you may choose to add a WordPress blog alongside your existing site . <p> Blogs are powerful content marketing tools and are used by thousands of leading companies to help build customer communities and drive sales . Companies which use WordPress include Disney , Sony , Toyota and many more blue chip enterprises . <p> If creating a blog now or in the future is part of your strategy , make sure your web host fully caters for WordPress sites . <h> Room to grow <p> When you launch an online business , it means that when your business grows , you website is going to grow too . What might start out as a small website with a few pages , a handful of products and a few thousand visitors a month can soon become a dozen websites with thousands of products and millions of visitors . In addition , you may also have to run various background applications that require large data storage and huge processing power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that can offer you the capacity to grow " but at the time and rate that best suits your company . When you start out you may be on a tight budget and need low-cost shared hosting ; as you grow , you may move from shared to VPS to dedicated managed servers . Eventually , you may want to move to cloud hosting . <p> Ideally , you should choose a web host that can offer all these types of hosting and who can help you move from one type of hosting to the other seamlessly and without complications . <h> Scalability for spikes <p> As you grow bigger , not only may you need to upgrade to a larger hosting package , but you may need to look for a host that offers flexible scalability to help you handle spikes . Spikes ( periods of dramatically increased traffic or demands on your system ) can happen for many reasons , for example , a mention of your business on the news or social media that sends your website viral , or having seasonal products which generate high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year . <p> If you think you may have significant spikes , you need a web host that can provide the capacity to handle the spikes and , when the spike is over , let you return to the less expensive , lower capacity usage you normally require . This kind of scalability is found with cloud hosting . Make sure your host offers flexible scaling as part of their cloud hosting packages . <h> Website Builders <p> One service that is always worth looking for in a web host is a website builder . Many business owners wrongly consider building a website to be a highly technical process and spend a great deal of money paying a web developer to build one for them . In reality , the vast number of websites which businesses need can be built very easily using an automated website builder . <p> Website builders are programs which let you design how your website looks and what features it has but take care of the coding for you . There 's no need to know about HTML , CSS or PHP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fonts , etc and then inputting the content . Modern website builders come with an array of templates , images and features that allow you to create a professional website and customise it to suit your brand . <p> If you choose a web host who has a website builder , you can save a great deal of money designing your website and have the ability to change the way your website looks at any time . <h> Easy control over your own website <p> When you start your online business you will be given access to the back-end of your website from your web host . Accessing this area will allow you to take control of a number of different administrative settings : emails , software , security , etc . <p> Navigating through the back-end of you website can be difficult if the interface you are provided with is n't user-friendly . For this reason , you should choose a web host that offers with CPanel or Plesk interfaces . These offer easy navigation around the backend of your site via a single dashboard with features arranged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , updates and software installs can be achieved in just a few clicks . <h> E-Commerce features <p> If you are setting up an online business , then you will need to provide customers with the means to pay for your products . One of the most important features you will need is a shopping cart . To make this easy , look for a web host that offers e-commerce tools that accept third-party shopping cart programs such as WorldPay , ZenCart and PayPal . <p> Different shopping cart providers charge different rates and have different features , so you want to be able to choose the one which is best for your business . <h> SSL to protect your customers <p> When you sell online , it is possible that credit card details can be intercepted by hackers during the payment process . The safest way to protect your customers and your business is to make sure that this information is encrypted during payment , this way even if details are intercepted , hackers would not be able to unscramble them . To enable encryption , you need SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address from HTTP to HTTPS and when people visit your website , a padlock icon appears next to your URL in the browser . This let 's visitors know your site is safe to use . <p> SSL is available from most good web hosts . If you are selling online , make sure your web host provides this service . <h> Compatibility <p> If you are moving to a new web host and already have a website and apps in place , you do need to make sure that they will be compatible with the hardware and software used by your host . This is especially important if you are currently running legacy software on older servers . <p> You should speak to your new host prior to taking out a contract with them and ask them about compatibility . Even if somethings are not compatible , there may be alternative solutions that the host can put in place to help you . <h> Easy to leave <p> When you choose a web host , probably one of the last things you will be considering is leaving them , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what happens if you decide to end your contract . Whilst most hosts make it fairly easy , some others make it more difficult to move your domain to a different host . Before signing up to a host , always read the small print of your contract to make sure that if you want to move , you can do so without any issues . <h> Pricing <p> We 've left pricing until last , and deliberately so . For many start-up online businesses , pricing is often the first thing they will look at . However , when your entire online business depends upon the quality of the host you choose , price should not be your number one priority . You should think of the money you spend on hosting not simply as an overhead , but as an investment in the future of your business . This does not mean you should go with the most expensive host or with the cheapest . Instead , you should choose the host that best provides the services you need . Once you have found that host , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick one which is in the price range that is right for you . <h> Conclusion <p> After reading this article , you should be far better informed about what to look for when choosing a web host both in terms of their range of services and the features that their packages offer . @qwx190776 @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> Importance of Data Centers in Our Lives <p> In most of the cities , our life relies on the functioning and availability of one or multiple data centers .

In this post , we 'll go through those steps , giving you advice on how to complete them to give your content the best chance of success . <p> Before we do that , it is important to mention that optimising your posts is not the only factor that will help them rank well . Most importantly , you need to create high-quality content that is linked to from authority websites , as this is what search engines value the most . On top of that , you need a website that loads quickly and which is designed to work on all devices . <p> Here are our 10 tips for optimising your WordPress posts . <h> 1 . Install the Yoast SEO plugin <p> For the purposes of this post , we 'll only be looking at Yoast 's on-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brilliant for all kinds of WordPress SEO and does everything from creating XML sitemaps to making sure your URLs are search engine friendly . It really is an all-in-one SEO solution . <p> To install Yoast SEO , just go to Admin &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New , type Yoast SEO in the search box and click on install ' when the plugin appears . <p> Once you have the plugin installed , you will be able to use it to optimise your posts . We 'll be referring to it during this article . <h> 2 . Get the right keywords before you start <p> When you optimise a WordPress post for search engines , what you are really doing is making sure that the keywords you want your post to rank for are used effectively within the content . So , before you start to create the content , you need to know exactly what your keywords are . For detailed advice on how to do this , read our post Best Keyword Research Techniques for SEO . <p> Once you have researched your keywords , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyword for the post <p> Alternative versions of the keyword that searchers often use <p> Long-tail keywords that can target specific users <p> These will form the basis of your posts optimisation . <h> 3 . Writing the post 's title <p> The title is one of the most vital elements of on-page SEO and time and effort needs to be put into writing it . Search engines assume that the title will relate directly to the topic being written about and so it is the first thing they will look at to see if your post is relevant to a search query . <p> For this reason , you need to include your keyword in the title and , ideally , as near the beginning as possible . For example , if you were writing a post about packed lunches for school children and the keyword was packed lunches ' you 'd be better off writing this : <p> 10 Great Packed Lunches School Kids Will Love <p> Instead of this : <p> School Kids Will Love These 10 Great Packed Lunches <p> Do remember that search engines list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to grab the attention of the user . If it does n't , no-one will click on it . <h> 4 . Configure your subheadings <p> When exploring your content , search headings will look to see if the keywords or related topic words are included in the subheadings of your text , so it is important to include them . <p> What many WordPress users fail to do is to format subheadings as subheadings . Just putting them in bold or underlining them does n't work . To create a proper subheading , you need to give it an H2 tag . This can be done easily . Simply highlight the subheading , click on the drop-down box that says paragraph ' in the toolbar and select Heading 2 ' " see image below . <p> Do not choose Heading 1 ' . A post should only have one H1 heading and that is the title . WordPress creates the H1 tag automatically for you , so unlike subheadings , there 's no need to do it manually . If you do create a second H1 subheading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your page " so avoid this . <h> 5 . Keywords in the opening paragraph <p> In the same way that search engines assume you 'll put the keywords in the title , they also expect to see them in the opening paragraph . The reason for this is that the opening paragraph is usually an introduction that tells the reader what the post is going to be about . If the title is 10 Great Packed Lunches School Kids Will Love ' then their algorithms will search the opening paragraph for a mention packed lunches . <p> If the keyword is n't there , the search engines will presume that packed lunches ' is not the topic you are writing about and are less likely to rank your post for that term . <h> 6 . Keywords in the closing paragraph <p> The same logic applies to the closing paragraph . As the last part of the post is usually a conclusion of some kind , there is an expectancy from search engines that , in summing up , you 'll make reference to the topic you are writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyword . <h> 7 . Keyword density <p> This is the tricky one . Keyword density refers to the ratio of your keywords to the overall length of the piece . A search engine will assume that , if your keyword is the central topic of your post , it will keep getting referred to throughout . Use it too sparingly and it could signal that your post might be about a different subject . However , be warned : use your keyword too much and search engines will start to think you are using a black hat SEO technique called keyword stuffing in order to help you rank artificially " this can cause you to get penalised . <h> 8 . Check the content with Yoast <p> One of the brilliant things about Yoast is that after you have written the content and specified your primary keyword , it analyses the post for you , tells you what you have done well and shows you where you need to make SEO improvements . See the image below : <h> 9 . Put the keywords in the meta description <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespoke meta description which is used by search engines to consider the relevancy of your post . It can also be displayed underneath the title in search engine results . This too should contain the keyword that your post wants to rank for . Just like the title , it should also be written to catch the attention of the reader . <h> 10 . Do n't forget to optimise your images <p> Finally , you should also include the keyword in at least one of the alt tags for your images . This is simple to do. - Click on the image in your visual editor and select the pencil ( Edit ) icon that appears underneath . When the dialogue box opens , write a short description of the image , including the keyword , in the Alternative Text ' box and click save . <p> Doing this means your images will also be optimised for the keywords . This will help the post rank for the keywords and may even help people find your post by searching for related images . <h> Conclusion <p> Reading this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to carry out on-page SEO for your WordPress posts . You should have a better understanding of how to optimise titles and subheadings , content , meta descriptions and images . In addition , you will have seen how the plugin Yoast SEO can be helpful in ensuring that your on-page optimisation fulfils the criteria required to give your post the maximum chance of being ranked . <p> If you are a WordPress user looking for dedicated WordPress web hosting , visit our- WordPress Hosting- page and see what we can do for you . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> Best Apps for Managing WordPress from Your Mobile <p> Websites are a 24/7 business , so you are not always guaranteed to be near a computer when you want to do work on your site .

Any good CIO should be able to review these different forms and assess them against the firm 's existing IT provisions to decide where the starting point should be , and with what services . <p> Most cloud services can be listed under one of three categories : Software as a Service ( Saas ) , Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) , and Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) . For an organization where cloud services are being used for the first time , it is recommended that CIOs starts with the most basic form of cloud services , SaaS , since this provides the lowest level of risk , but also represents a good opportunity to start understanding the benefits of cloud . Examples of SaaS services would be Office 365 from Microsoft , or Dropbox for Business ; both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and operate in ways that your colleagues will be use to , so there will be little need for retraining . <p> If your deployment of SaaS services has proven to be successful , then you should investigate potential PaaS and IaaS solutions for your company . As these services are more complex in their nature and carry higher risk because of the potential use cases , it is always a good idea to try potential candidates out in a test environment . A test environment will let you test out every aspect of multiple applications so that you can narrow them down to the most suitable . <h> 2 ) What are the benefits ? <p> A number of benefits can be derived from a shift to cloud hosting . The main benefit , and the one that is most likely to appeal to managers , is the cost savings that you can be realised . Maintaining a completely physical IT infrastructure and relying on legacy licensing models have proven to be a costly burdens and ones that do n't represent good value for money . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reducing the overall amount of physical hardware that you rely on and with less hardware and data centre spacing being required , your monthly hosting bills will be greatly reduced . It has even been suggested that the cloud can delivery bottom line savings of up to 25% . <p> Scalability and agility are other benefits that the cloud can deliver . Cloud environments are developed around powerful clusters that are able to deliver additional resources on demand , so if your website experiences an unexpected surge in traffic , or you are looking to add new , more powerful features , then you can call on the cloud to provide you with the extra capacity necessary . Whilst the cloud can scale up to cope with extra demand , it can also scale down afterwards so that you are only ever billed for your actual usage . Such scalability and agility is only demonstrated in virtual environments , with physical servers downtime is often required in order for additional components to be provisioned so that you can increase capacity . <h> 3 ) Why should we invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectives of your organisation not just now , but well into the future . <p> Mobility ; better CRM ; consolidation and optimisation ; reduced costs ; stronger security : these are strategic IT objectives for most organisations , but these are also roles that What makes a cloud environment reliable ? . Never before has one platform been able to tick off so many objectives in one foul swoop . It is for this reason that any Board of Directors that has the interests of their shareholders at heart will implement cloud solutions without question . <h> 4 ) What will the impact be on your role ? <p> Implementing the cloud in your organisation will serve to make the business more competitive through cost reductions and the option to provision additional IT infrastructure components in a matter of minutes . As you 're the CIO , the one implementing the cloud , the person who is driving change for the better , you could see your position within the organisation rise as other directors in the business recognise the huge and positive impact that your role and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast these days and gone are the times when you 'll be wanting to sign long contracts just so you can secure the best price . With cloud providers it is more effective to sign short-term contracts , generally of three years or less , since this allows you to remain flexible and will allow you to exploit the latest technologies as they come along . Working with multiple providers is now common practice too , as many CIOs recognise that no provider is able to offer a solution that provides all the features that they are after . Instead , different departments are likely to choose services on their own accord where more specific toolsets are required , although this will also be alongside any company-wide systems deployed . <p> Reputation and security are also key considerations for choosing a cloud provider . Many CIOs will be entrusting private information and data that has always been hosted in-house to third-party companies and for once , they will no longer be in control . On the other hand , cloud providers look to use the latest security techniques to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide more protection than- an in-house environment , with this benefit outweighing the disadvantage of outsourcing control . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> IaaS , PaaS , SaaS Cloud Computing Services Comparison and Advantages <p> In my- previous post , I defined and differentiated , How principles of virtualisation can help you to understand cloud computing .

@@14549055 @3149055/ <h> What is CloudLinux ? How it works and its Importance in cPanel Web Hosting <h> What is CloudLinux ? How it works and its Importance in cPanel Web Hosting <p> CloudLinux is an add-on for cPanel web hosting services that installs a new kernel that helps system administrators to better manage cPanel web hosting users . We have recently deployed CloudLinux across our range of cPanel web hosting servers as a way of improving the level of service that we provide to our customers . Here I 'll be explaining the importance of CloudLinux in cPanel hosting and how our new setup compares to the old scenario . <h> The old scenario <p> Before CloudLinux , there were no restrictions in place on cPanel hosting systems that prevented a single user from hogging major server resources , such as the CPU(s) for example . This meant that if a hacker was intent on bringing a server down , all they had to do was find a website on their chosen server that contained even just one vulnerability . They could then exploit this vulnerability using a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource usage on the server so that there are no free resources remaining , which would then cause the server to crash . <h> So what does CloudLinux do ? <p> CloudLinux in a cPanel web hosting environment creates an individual virtual container for each website . System administrators can then set hard limits for individual websites so that the performance and security of one website ca n't impact on the performance of its neighbours . Parameters that can be set include the amount of CPU power that a single website can use and disk IOPS ; these are beyond what a regular cPanel installation can facilitate , which is often limited to specific account features like MySQL databases and FTP accounts . With each virtual container having a pre-determined hard limit , you can make much more accurate predictions about potential server load , enabling you to retain adequate spare capacity . <p> The virtual container can act as a buffer against any websites that are targeted . So if a website using a cPanel hosting package is compromised , only that particular website and environment is affected " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment to attack other websites and data . <p> Users will now know when it 's time to upgrade to a new type of hosting . CloudLinux helps to keep shared hosting a fair business with which all clients get access to their full entitlement of resources . When a user hits their limits , then they know it 's time to start optimising their website to make better use of their available resources , or alternatively to upgrade to a more powerful form of web hosting , i.e. a VPS or dedicated server . <h> Summing up <p> As a summary , CloudLinux plays an important role in cPanel web hosting and providing a service that is fair to all customers . The virtual container created for each website provides a buffer against any malicious attacks so that only the compromised website is affected and the attacks do n't have the power to spread beyond this . The facility to more explicitly limit the resources of each website provides a fairer service to all and means that no single website will have the power to utilise all available resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also see this as a way of increasing account density since you can more accurately plan for loads placed on servers . And with your servers under less pressure they are less likely to crash or experience issues , allowing you to see reduced support costs . @qwx190776

The majority of these were local businesses . Some owners did n't think the size of their business warranted the need for a website , whilst others cited cost and lack of time as reasons for not having one created . <p> Instead , their owners rely on word or mouth , local advertising and business listings sites such as Yell in order to generate new business . However , by not having a website , many are missing out on a wide range of opportunities , spending more on advertising than they would on running a website and losing a great deal of business at the same time . For those who have n't yet made the decision , this post will explain seven reasons why local businesses need a website. <h> 1 . Sell further afield <p> In pre-internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies in the same town . If someone wanted to buy a TV or a get their car repaired there might have been only a handful of places they could go . Today , people go online and can get their goods or services from anywhere . <p> For local businesses , this can be both a threat and an opportunity . It 's a threat because many customers will now look online rather than coming to visit your shop , so your local market will , effectively , have shrunk , putting your business at risk . However , the internet also offers the opportunity for you to sell your products and services anywhere too " so what you lose locally , you can more than compensate for by selling further afield . If you sell curtains in Derby , there 's no reason why you ca n't sell them in Dunstable too . <p> However , you can only do this if you have a channel from which to sell and this is why a website is so important . It 's a shop front to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and existing customers <p> Websites are not just for selling your products and services , they are also a way to build relationships with customers so that they stay loyal to your business . Once you have a website , you have a means of maintaining communication with them over the long term and can use this to significant advantage . <p> You can use your website to send newsletters , advertise events or sales , offer discounts or voucher codes , run competitions and much more . These are all ways that help generate new business and keep existing customers coming back . <p> What 's more , it 's been proved that even if a customer can find something cheaper elsewhere , they are much more likely to stay with a business that they have built a relationship with " even if that is an online relationship . <h> 3 . Improve the effectiveness of directory listings <p> Many local businesses list their company on sites like Yell and feel this is the only web presence they need . However , showing your phone number , address and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to consider is how people behave when using a directory site . <p> What people do when searching Yell or Thompsons , is find your business listing and then immediately look for the link to your website . As people are disinclined to make a phone call when using the internet , if you do n't have a website , rather than call you , they 'll look for a business that does have a website . Even if your business is the obvious best choice , they 'll only come back to find your number if they fail to find a website that 's got what they are looking for . <p> What this means is that if you do n't have a website , a significant number of the people who do find you on a directory listing are n't going to bother getting in touch and the investment you are putting into your directory listing is largely being wasted . <h> 4 . Showcase your products or services <p> Of course , if you do have a website , not only can you tell people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sell them directly from your site . <p> Modern websites enable you to create portfolios of your best work , so if you are a dress designer , builder or landscape gardener you can let your customers see exactly what the quality of your work is . If you are a retailer , you can create an e-commerce site and sell the products there and then . <p> Again , the reasons why these elements are important to your business is because of how internet users behave . They expect to be able to see what they are looking for and , if it is for sale , to be able to buy there and then . If they ca n't , they 'll look elsewhere . <p> This is one area where many local retailers fail with their websites : they tell the visitor they stock something but then disappoint them by not giving the opportunity to buy it instantly . If you are sat in your armchair at home and you have the choice between driving to your local store or ordering something without going anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more expensive . <h> 5 . Get feedback from your customers <p> One of the great things you can do with a website is ask your customers to give you feedback . You can use surveys , ratings and other methods to see exactly what your customers think about your business . This is great for helping your company to improve , whether that 's customer service , products or services , premises , prices , delivery or any other factor which your customers find important . <p> Giving customers the chance to give anonymous feedback also means you 're more likely to get honest feedback too . <h> 6 . Take orders for customers to collect or to be delivered <p> One way local businesses can benefit from a website is to follow the example of many takeaways . Takeaways often have their menus online and enable customers to choose their meals , pay online and get them delivered to the door . Because they are local , this can be done very quickly . <p> Customers are now flocking to similar services being offered by many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using local businesses to change their car tyres , have their ironing collected and dropped off , get their windows cleaned , book cinema tickets , shop for groceries and much more . <p> These are all ways local businesses can offer customers a much-improved service " but the only effective way of achieving this is through having a website that can offer the service , record the order , take the payment and schedule the appointment or delivery . Whilst this can be done through a phone line and written down in a book " it is more time consuming , less effective and because it 's done over the phone , its much less appealing to internet users . It really needs to be offered online . <h> 7 . Extend your opening hours <p> If your local business opens from 9 to 5 , one of your problems is that by the time your customers get home from work , you 'll have closed for the day . With a website , you can make your business , or at least parts of it , available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time of day , whilst a site offering local services can continue to take bookings after you have gone home . Adding simple contact forms means customers can ask questions or send enquiries which , without a website , they would never have the chance to do . <h> Conclusion <p> More and more people are using the internet to research and find local services or products and their expectation is that every company will have a website .

@@14549066 @3149066/ <p> Load balancing is a set of techniques that configure the servers and other hardware in such a way that the workload is distributed equally amongst the servers , thereby reducing the dependency on any single server and making it easy to add resources in such a way that performance is scaled according to the resources added . A load balancer checks the utilization of all servers in a cluster . The server with the estimated best performance gets the next user request . This algorithm ensures the best performance available at the time is given to the users . A very important consideration here is the quality of the load balancer . In this case , quality means the opportunity of the system to make a highly qualified forecast about which server will offer the best performance concerning an individual application . Another aspect to make the decision is to reconnect the client to an existing session . Without any kind of protection , the load balancer could be a single point of failure . If one server is out of service , then the whole system would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ node , and mark the crashed system . The total performance of the load balancing server ( cluster ) will be reduced , but the services would still continue to function . <p> A high availability clustering , also called a failover clustering , is used to protect one or more business critical applications , 100% uptime websites . High availability cluster solutions which include the opportunity to configure protection for one or more applications are state-of-the-art . With this kind of a solution , the crash of one application does n't require a restart of the complete node , thereby not interrupting all the other working applications . Depending on the client-side of the application , the last transaction could be lost during a failover . <p> Basic HTTP Load Balancing <p> A typical Linux Load Balancing Solution architecture consists of 2 or more similar configuration web servers and database servers which are behind a Load Balancer or Master Server . Each web/database server will have a public IP assigned to it as well as an Internal LAN IP . After the implementation of Load Balancing routing rules on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web traffic on the web and database servers to pass through the Load Balancer or Master Server . The Load Balancer/Master Server then takes care of equal distribution of traffic on each of the web servers and passes on SQL queries to the database server . <p> We implement MySQL clustering between the database servers using MySQL Cluster software . MySQL Cluster service is used to provide high-availability , high-redundancy for the distributed computing environment . It is a fault tolerant in-memory clustered database designed for 99.99% availability and fast automatic failover , all running on cost effective commodity hardware . <p> MySQL Cluster Core Concepts - NDBCLUSTER ( also known as NDB ) is an in-memory storage engine offering high-availability and data-persistence features . The NDBCLUSTER storage engine can be configured with a range of failover and load-balancing options , but it is easiest to start with the storage engine at the cluster level . MySQL Cluster 's NDB storage engine contains a complete set of data , dependent only on other data within the cluster itself . <p> There are three types of cluster nodes , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three nodes , one of each of these types : <p> A ) Management node : The role of this type of node is to manage the other nodes within the MySQL Cluster , performing functions such as providing configuration data , start and stop nodes , running backups , and so forth . Because this node type manages the configuration of the other nodes , a node of this type should be started first , before any other node . An MGM node is started with the command ndbmgmd . <p> B ) Data node : This type of node stores cluster data . There are as many data nodes as there are replicas , times the number of fragments . MySQL Cluster tables are normally stored completely in memory rather than on disk . <p> C ) SQL node : This is a node that accesses the cluster data . In the case of MySQL Cluster , an SQL node is a traditional MySQL server that uses the NDBCLUSTER storage engine . An SQL node is a MySQLd process started with the --ndbcluster and --ndb-connectstring options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAProxy , a very fast and reliable solution offering high availability , load balancing , and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications which distributes the traffic between the servers . It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing . Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with today 's hardware . Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and risk free , while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net . <p> HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly suited for high availability environments . It can : <p> Route HTTP requests depending on statically assigned cookies . <p> Spread the load among several servers while assuring server persistence through the use of HTTP cookies . <p> Switch to backup servers in the event a main one fails . <p> Accept connections to special ports dedicated to service monitoring . <p> Stop accepting connections without breaking existing ones . <p> Add/modify/delete HTTP headers both ways . <p> Block requests matching a particular pattern . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies <p> Report detailed status as HTML pages to authenticated users from an URI intercepted from the application . <p> Being an event-driven architecture , it needs very little resource and allows easy handling of thousands of simultaneous connections on hundreds of instances without risking the system 's stability . <p> HAProxy supports several load-balancing algorithms : <p> Simple round robin ( traffic divided equally ) <p> Least connections ( server with least connections gets the request ) <p> And Source ( The source IP address is hashed and divided by the total weight of the running servers to designate which server will receive the request ) <p> The source algorithm ensures that the same client IP address will always reach the same server as long as no server goes down or up . Very important when using HAProxy to load balance databases and avoid replication latencies . <p> While every scenario is different , a general configuration for a basic load balancing server setup would look similar to this : <p> Load Balancer &amp; MYSQL Cluster Management NODE VM/Server &amp;ndash ; the Virtual Machine/Server for the load balancer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also install the MySQL cluster management node on the load balancer which keeps database synchronization between the database servers/VMs <p> Application &amp; Database Server/VM &amp;ndash ; The two Virtual Machines or Dedicated servers for the application &amp; database should be built using the template and resources that best suit your needs . Additional application Dedicated server or Virtual Machines can be added anytime to the load balancing setup . <p> High availability runs on top of the load balancer configuration , using a second load balancer server . This provides multiple points of failure , meaning that if the primary load balancer server is unavailable , the secondary load balancer server immediately takes over so that your applications or sites are not down . <p> High Availability - Basic Configuration <p> High availability service also known as Failover Clustering uses two servers as load balancers , and at least two servers as application and database servers . Servers in a load balancing and high availability configuration are spread across two or more data centres and multiple racks so that there is no single point of failure . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard load balancing and high availability setup would look similar to this : <p> Load Balancer The two servers for the load balancers have to be built using the Load Balancer Appliance template .

The MySQL Cluster management node is setup on both load balancer servers . <p> Application &amp; Database Server Minimum two servers for the application servers should be built using the template and resources that best suit your needs . You can easily add additional application servers to the load balancing setup later when required .

FTP is now a common feature with most web hosting accounts and many people take it for granted that they will be provided with FTP access to their web hosting account with their chosen package ; in some cases people may choose to use alternative solutions such as the file manager that is part of their web hosting control panel .

As a VPS or dedicated server user you will find that FTP is incredibly useful when it comes to uploading files to any part of your server , however it is recommended that you only allow FTP access to your web directories instead of your entire server since this could cause problems if your server is hacked .

FTP is now the standard used for online file transfer , but if you are in a rush then you can easily make use of the file manager that is provided with your control panel to upload and download files from your web space . <h> HA-OSCAR <p> HA-OSCAR - High Availability Open Source Cluster Application Resources is an open source project aims to provide a combined power of High Availability and Performance Computing solution .

@@14549072 @3149072/ <h> 5 Reasons to Use a CMS ( Content Management System ) <h> 5 Reasons to Use a CMS ( Content Management System ) <p> Content Management Systems , otherwise shortened to CMS , are used as the base for many websites on the Internet . Whilst developing your own website from scratch may seem like the best option for those craving customisation and full control over how it works , most popular CMS programs offer a similar option and for all intents and purposes act as a skeleton on which you can add your own design with themes and functionality with plugins . CMS can also be regarded as being more secure as the developers of these systems often move to provide bug patches the moment any security holes are discovered . Here are the 5 top reasons why we think you should consider using a CMS <h> 1 ) Simple even for non-technically minded users <p> The chances are that you will find a CMS easy to install , no matter what your level of technical knowledge may be . CMS have evolved from being applications used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely anyone , and the installation processes have also evolved to reflect this . Gone are the days when you had to download the files from a website , upload them to your web space and then perform the configurations manually , instead we find that many applications now feature simple installation wizards . This theme has also been continued with how a CMS website can be managed , as integrated administrations panels have made it far easier for users to edit their content , or expand their websites in the way of plugins and templates with minimal effort and absolutely no need for any technical knowledge . <h> 2 ) Management duties can be shared <p> In certain cases a website may be being managed by multiple people rather than having a single webmaster and to reflect this any good CMS will provide support for multiple users . You can then provide each of the site 's admins with their own user account so that they can then work in parallel and use the admin interface at the same time , rather than administration being limited to one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user account . <h> 3 ) Expandable functionality <p> Most popular CMS applications have large community followings that are there to provide support and assistance in lieu of any official sources . With these communities come a number of developers who like to expand the functionality of these applications with the use of extra plugins , a feature included with most CMS . Using WordPress as an example , although the application is already feature-rich , if there is an additional feature that you would like to use with your installation then the chances are that somebody has already developed a free plugin to fulfil that purpose . The same can be said for other popular CMS such as Joomla and Drupal ; whilst expanding the functionality of your own website could take a lot longer because you have to develop your own code , if you rely on a CMS instead then you can tap into the collections of third-party plugins that can provide the functionality that you are after for little to no work on your part . <h> 4 ) Designing your site does n't require messing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for many CMS , theme functionality will also be included so that you can change the design of your website with just a single click in most cases . This means that when creating a design for your site , all it will take is for you to develop a template/theme based on the instructions provided in the documentation , upload this to your web space , apply it as necessary , then you should find that all of your pages now follow the same universal look . As you can see it 's a lot less hassle that is involved with designing your own website or CMS from scratch . If you are n't the most creative of people then for any popular CMS you can expect there to be an abundance of third-party themes for you to choose from . <h> 5 ) Editing made simple <p> Most popular CMS applications feature a web-based administration interface that provides all the features that you need to keep your site 's content up-to-date . With sites that have been developed using static HTML pages , when you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update individual pages and then re-upload these to your web space . Depending on the number of pages that require modification and the changes that you need to make , this can be quickly become a time consuming process . With a CMS all you will need to do is login to the admin panel , choose the page that you would like to change and then modify it directly in the browser , the changes will be reflected immediately once you 've saved them " no need to re-upload anything or modify multiple pages . <p> Ben 's main IT experience is on software , programming , website development and marketing topics including search engine optimisation .

While there may be certain similarities , is cloud computing actually another name for Virtualization ? Or is it any different from ? We will find answers to it here . <p> To understand the differences and similarities between these terms we first understand what Virtualization exactly means . <p> Virtualization refers to the creation of an intangible version of any physical resource like hardware , storage or operating system which is converted into a virtual form . It seeks to create multiple version of hardware which can be then utilized for various users instead of one and thereby reduce the overhead costs . <p> With Virtualization it is possible to create many virtual computers from one single machine and each virtual machine so created can be run independently . Each virtualized machine can have its own operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud Computing can be understood as the cluster of computer or machines which are interconnected with each other and the resources are provided in a combined manner and the load is balanced between them to reduce failure on a single machine and provide better performance to users . <p> Although Virtualization may the base for Cloud Computing there are many differences in the ways these two are used and implemented . Cloud computing may be implemented with Virtualization and in some cases without it as well . Both these provide on-demand utilization , optimized resources and scalability . However , the areas of differentiation include factors like self-provisioning , utility based billing and APIs . <p> To understand the actual difference between the two is not that difficult . Self- serving model is an essential characteristic of cloud computing , but it may or may not be so for Virtualization . Although in many cases there is self serving in Virtualization but it is not essential . However , in cloud computing it becomes important to deliver the resources as and when required which is its main feature . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in traditional IT infrastructure . This also allows organizations to reduce their operating expenses to some extent . However , the businesses still have to have their own IT infrastructure and equipments and software as well . <p> On the contrary , cloud computing allows you to do away with need of having such infrastructure and have the freedom to get resources on demand and thus reduces your capital investment . <p> What 's better ? <p> Virtualization allows you to reduce your overhead costs , but it does not do away with the need to maintain hardware . Whereas , Cloud Computing has low upfront costs , provides resources on demand , the ongoing cost is also not high due to the pay per use model .

@@14549075 @3149075/ <p> What is the difference between DKIM and SPF ? DKIM ( DomainKeys Identified Mail ) is a reliable system that you can use when sending e-mails to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the e-mail - such as the e-mail subject and the e-mail body . When an e-mail is sent by the server when any portion of the e-mail is encrypted , the server receiving the e-mail will verify the authenticity of the encrypted value by decrypting the encrypted value with the public key that is visible in the DNS record for the domain name because if the encrypted value matches the original content , the only way in which the value could have been encrypted from a malicious user is by the private key being made available to a malicious user . Otherwise , the authenticity is message is completely assured . <p> SPF ( short for Sender Policy Framework ) , on the other hand , is another kind of Email Authentication protocol where you are restricting what IP addresses can send e-mails for a specific domain name . For example , if you owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict the IP addresses that are considered legitimate for sending e-mails that are supposed to be arriving from " example.com " , you 'd add an SPF record listing all of the IP addresses ( or likely in many cases , just one ) and for any web server that checks the SPF records of incoming e-mails will automatically delete e-mails that are being received from IP addresses that are not sanctioned under the SPF records for the domain name that the e-mail account is under to which the e-mail is being " sent from " . <p> But is DKIM completely secure ? Yes , it is a very secure authentication system and as I had said previously , the data can only be decrypted from any outside entity ( including you ) using the " public " key that is made available to the recipient of the e-mail . The encryption occurs by the server sending the e-mail prior to it being transmitted to the receipient server in which your e-mail account is located on . This means for an important organisation such as a bank , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been tampered with during transit , because no malicious user would be able to tamper with the encryption data unless they knew what the private key was to be able to encrypt any information which can then be decrypted by the server when it makes a DNS lookup on the domain name in question to find the public key to decrypt the information . And like all public-key cryptography systems , the encryption is guaranteed by trusting that the private key is securely in the hands of the right people only . <p> What should I use ? DKIM or SPF ? Both . To some people SPF does n't seem very useful if it requires that servers both set SPF records for domains and servers check the SPF records of incoming e-mails that are received , because not all servers either check SPF records or set SPF records for domains . In fact , with cPanel Hosting you are able to set the SPF records for your domains within the Email Authentication section of the cPanel control panel . However , it does n't hurt to set SPF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require an SPF record to be set for incoming e-mails . DKIM can also be enabled in the same section within cPanel.

Are you warey of the security claims put forward by cloud storage companies and are unsure about now having control over your data ? Well , there is now an answer to that in the form of OwnCloud . OwnCloud is an open source cloud platform that provides common features such as calendar management , file storage and contact management ; the difference is that rather than hosting your data in a third-party environment that you have no control over , OwnCloud can be installed on your own cloud or dedicated server , or even on a shared web hosting plan , so that you will always have control of your data . <p> Web installer <p> The web installer means that you can turn any shared web hosting account into a personal cloud . With the web installer it is just a case of downloading a single file from http : //www.owncloud.org , uploading this to your web space and following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locating the nearest and most convenient location to download the full package from to minimise the installation time . <p> Installing on your own server <p> A cloud or dedicated server would be recommended for where you are looking to establish an OwnCloud environment for an organisation . In enterprise environments the application can be integrated with existing LDAP and Active Directory deployments so you wo n't have to supply colleagues with another set of login credentials . <p> Integration with desktop and mobile devices <p> As a user of Apple 's iCloud or any of Google 's apps , you will probably be a fan of the seamless syncing that is available between the different devices that you own " all courtesy of the cloud , of course . Well by choosing OwnCloud , you do n't have to lose these abilities , as indeed they are standard features of the platform . <p> Calendar syncing is available through a technology known as CalDAV , which also forms the basis of the calendar syncing functions found in third-party technologies . CalDAV enables you to download your calendar information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add them to your calendars on the desktop , with this information being kept in constant sync with all devices that are accessing your OwnCloud account . CalDAV is available on Android , Windows Phone and iOS devices and is also supported by the major desktop operating systems . <p> Contact/address book syncing is available using CardDAV , a technology similar to CalDAV . With CardDAV syncing you are able to sync your entire address book across all devices that are connected to your OwnCloud account . In the same way that calendar changes are reflected across all devices , when you modify a contact or add a new one , this will be automatically reflected across all connected devices . <p> Third-party Apps <p> There are a number of third-party apps available for OwnCloud so that you can do different things with it . One of my favourites has to be the External Storage app that let 's you mount your accounts from other cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox as local folders in your account , simplifying the migration process where you are using either of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these platforms however , so if for example someone would like to share a Dropbox folder with you then they can do and you wo n't have to continue to use another service to access it " instead it will be accessible through your OwnCloud account . <p> Another app I 've taken to use is Roundcube . A third-party app enables you to integrate any existing Roundcube installation into OwnCloud and with features such as auto-login , the integration is seamless and allows you to move between the two as if they are one application " this also goes to extend the functionality of OwnCloud and with it the application proves itself to be a stable cloud platform that can rival any public offering . <p> To offer a conclusion , I would say that OwnCloud only stands to grow in popularity as people and enterprises become more concerned about the true security of their data , given the recent leaks we have seen from the NSA and the co-operation of companies such as Google or Apple in sharing user data . With OwnCloud you maintain control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> Myspace Marketing- Myth or Math <p> Myspace is a vast online social networking site in which members can create and update personalized web profiles of themselves , thousands of users join daily for various reasons &amp; one of the reason co ...

It 's the ideal vehicle for introducing new products and services , reaching out to new audiences and promoting your brand . Whether you are aiming for viral impact or focussing in on a local demographic , Twitter is a channel where you can make a significant marketing impact . If you have n't set up Twitter for your business , yet , this post will show you how to do it and how to get started promoting your company . <h> Why you should consider Twitter for business <p> If you do n't quite get Twitter and do n't see the point , here are some stats to get you thinking : <p> There are 1.3 billion people with Twitter accounts worldwide . 74% of them use Twitter to follow SME brands that they like and 47% of those followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweets. 52% of Twitter users also claim to have purchased a product that they saw for the first time on the platform . <p> On the other side of the coin , many people now use Twitter as a way to complain about companies they are not happy with . If you are not on Twitter , those complaints are just going to get shared . Clever businesses now use Twitter as part of their customer service " if someone complains , they deal with it there and then ; and frequently turn potentially damaging publicity into a PR success . <p> So , here 's how to get started : <h> Open a Twitter account <p> The first step you need to do is to- open a Twitter account . Signing up is easy to do : you just enter your name , business email and a secure password . Once this process is complete , you can begin creating your Twitter profile . <h> Choose the right username <p> One of the most important things you will need to do is to choose your username . Ideally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you have a very long business name , a shortened version might be preferable . Shorter names are easier to remember , spell and search for ; @M&amp;S is much easier for users that @marksandspencers . <p> The other thing to remember is that tweets are limited to 140 characters and if someone wants to communicate with you , they need to use your handle ' in the tweet . A long username , therefore , reduces the number of characters they can use . <p> With 1.3 billion accounts , you may also find that your desired username has already been taken . Whilst there may be something you can do about this if your company 's name is globally trademarked , for everyone else , you 'll just need to think of an appropriate alternative . You can always change it later . <h> Completing your profile <p> Setting up your Twitter profile is a very similar process to setting up a Facebook profile . To do this , simply click on Edit profile ' on the top right side of your profile page . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create your profile and header images . <h> Profile image <p> A profile image is the most important of the two as it will appear next to all your tweets and next to your username in search results . For businesses , the ideal image is one which has your business name or logo or , preferably , both . <p> The size of the image should be 400 x 400 pixels , be a maximum of 2MB in size and be a JPEG , GIF or PNG file . For internet images , the image should be 72dpi . <h> Header image <p> When designing your Twitter page , the cover photo will play an important part in your branding so it 's important to upload an image that says something about your company and is strong enough to have an instant impact . <p> From a design perspective , it should complement your profile image and not have colours which clash " especially as part of the profile image will cover up a small section of the header . <p> The size of the header image should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or PNG file and , like the profile image , be no larger than 2MB . <h> Editing your profile image <p> To change your images , hover over the image , click or tap the camera icon and select Upload photo ' or Remove ' . <p> Twitter will also let you show your Vine images if you have a Vine account connected to Twitter . Just choose to Show my Vine profile ' on your Twitter profile . <h> Writing your bio <p> Unlike Facebook , where you can add a long description to your profile , Twitter is much more insistent on brevity and gives you only 160 characters to describe your business . This can make it difficult so summarise what your business does . <p> To make the bio user-friendly and interesting to read , rather than try to cram as much detail as you can into those 160 characters , stick to your core message and say it in an engaging way that sums up your brand. - If you have used text on your header image , you can build on this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text in the image , you are looking for short , catchy sentences . <p> The other factor to consider is that , as a social media platform , Twitter users expect businesses to be less formal and corporate . People on there want to see the human side of your business and brand , so keep that in mind when you write . <h> Other profile information <p> The profile options in Twitter are quite limited . The focus is on what you tweet , not what 's on the side panel of your profile . The other sections you can complete are your location , your website address and the date your company joined Twitter . <h> Getting started on Twitter <p> Your primary aim as a newcomer to Twitter is to grow your audience of followers . When you first sign in to Twitter you 'll see what is known as your Twitter feed . This contains the most recent tweets of all the people or companies you have followed . If you want your tweets to appear on other people 's feeds , you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The easiest way to get followers on Twitter is to follow people first . The Twitter community is generally very good at following back . However , as a business , you obviously want to target the right people , so here 's an example of how you could achieve this . <p> Let 's presume you 've launched a new collection of t-shirts and want to promote them . To find people who are interested , search for a competitor , go to their profile page and click on their list of followers . You would then need to search through the followers and follow the ones who you think are most likely to be interested in your products . Hopefully , some of these would follow you back . <p> Do be careful with this method , if you follow hundreds of people every day just to achieve high follower numbers , Twitter will block you " especially when you hit the 2000 followers mark . <p> The best way to get followers is to tweet interesting content such as an image , a video or a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the right people , you should find a relevant hashtag # ' that people are following . So , taking our T-shirt brand example , you could take a picture of someone wearing a new T-shirt design and then post your tweet with the hashtag #newtees . Everyone who was following #newtees would then see your tweet in their feed . People who like the design might follow you and , even better , retweet your image to their followers . <p> The more tweeting you do , the more your brand will get followed and shared . <h> Taking part <p> Twitter is not just there for you to advertise your products and services " it 's a social platform . Other users will send you tweets , ask you questions and comment on what you do . To make the most of the platform for building your brand , it 's important that you spend some time engaging with other users . Doing this will soon help you grow a much bigger audience . <h> Getting seen <p> Finally , Twitter is big and it 's busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their feeds are enormous . Getting seen means creating striking tweets and posting them at a time when your followers are going to be online . This means making your content very relevant and tweeting often . To save time with this , you can write all your tweets at once and schedule them to go out at separate times . <h> Conclusion <p> From reading this article you should now have a much better understanding of how to : @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> Importance of an E-Commerce Store for Businesses <p> An eCommerce store is becoming a necessity these days for entrepreneurs to make their offering available to the consumers through the internet .

@@14549096 @3149096/ <h> PHP 7 is now available ! Find out what 's new . <h> PHP 7 is now available ! Find out what 's new . <p> Yesterday , the PHP development team finally announced the moment many of us have been waiting for " the first stable release of PHP 7 " and there are many interesting new features and changes . <h> Wheres PHP 6 ? <p> At the time PHP 6 was under development , one of the major new features underway was to bring native Unicode support to PHP . This project alone caused significant delays in the overall progress of PHP 6 due to technical challenges . It was later decided to postpone the native Unicode project and merge the other new features that were originally intended for PHP 6 into a new version of the PHP 5. x branch . <p> Here is where the problem lies : many books on PHP 6 were published at the time it was under development . An unfortunate mistake for publishers to make , because features can and do change before feature-freeze . <p> So for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHP 6 entirely and start again with PHP 7 . <h> What 's new in PHP 7 ? <p> Well be covering the new features that the developers amongst you will be interested to learn about . You can find a simple summary of the changes in PHP 7 and how you can upgrade in the Migrating from PHP 5.6. x to PHP 7.0. x manual on the PHP website . <h> Should I upgrade now ? <p> Before we answer this question , it is worth mentioning PHP 7 was originally scheduled for release on November 12 but was postponed by two weeks due to some last-minute bugs that the PHP development team wanted to fix beforehand ( and then postponed again on November 26 ) . This should serve as a testament to the kind of quality to expect . <p> For test environments , you should definitely upgrade as soon as possible so you can start testing your web applications against it . There are indeed changes in PHP 7 that may cause compatibility issues with a small subset of web applications " so do n't  blindly upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least confident your web application works flawlessly under PHP 7 , as it is a substantial upgrade from PHP 5.6 with many new features and changes . <p> Now the inevitable question : should I upgrade my production environment ? While PHP 7 is now " stable " , it might be a bit premature to upgrade just yet because there might be unknown bugs or vulnerabilities that are only spotted now that PHP 7 is in the wild . <p> It might be wiser to wait at least a couple months and in the meantime trying out the new version on a test environment to verify its compatibility with your web applications " deciding from there . <h> Upgrading to PHP 7 on GNU/Linux distributions <p> For some distributions that favour stability over new features , you might not be able to upgrade to PHP 7 until the distribution maintainers bring out a new stable release . For Debian in particular , this might not be until 2017 " the usual period between stable releases appear to be roughly every two years . And from what we 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Other distributions like Arch Linux and openSUSE should see PHP 7 hit the repositories in the near future . <p> In all cases of course , you can always compile and install PHP yourself if you are eager to try it now . This is certainly the route you 'll need to take if you are running Debian 8 or CentOS 7 . <h> So let 's get to the exciting parts what 's new in PHP 7 ? <h> PHP 7 : 2x faster than PHP 5. x <p> Thanks to a group of Zend developers working on PHPNG " a development branch of PHP that was originally created to experiment with a JIT ( Just In Time ) engine " PHP 7 benefits from up to 2x faster performance over PHP 5. x . <p> This branch , later merged into PHP 7 , features significant performance improvements in memory management . No , PHP has not become a JIT engine . If you 're interested in that , take a look at HHVM . <p> Speaking of which , the good folks at Phoronix.com did some benchmarking between PHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and us too " PHP 7 was found to have better performance in all the tests conducted except memory footprint . <h> PHP 7 : Return Type Declarations <p> One for the programmers : you can now define the expected return type of any function or method . If the returned type is not the same as the one declared , an EERROR is thrown . Defining a return type is simple : <p> function returnInt() : int echo 42 ; <p> Now it might sound strange for an interpreted scripting language to introduce return type declarations , but imagine how beneficial this will be for object interfaces " it provides assurance that any implementing class will never return unexpected values " and likewise for classes that inherit abstract classes . <h> PHP 7 : Deprecation of PHP 4 constructors <p> Creating constructor methods in PHP 4 involved defining a normal method that used the same name as the class it resides in . It was n't until PHP 5 saw the introduction of the construct() magical method to perform the same function . <p> You can hide these notices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon because PHP 4 constructor methods are scheduled for complete removal in PHP 8 . From this point on , these methods will act like any other normal method and will not be immediately executed when the class is initialised . <h> PHP 7 : Removal of alternative PHP tags <p> To little surprise , the PHP development team have removed support for ASP- and HTML-style PHP tags , which includes : <p> &lt;% opening tag &lt;%= opening tag with echo %&gt; closing tag <p> If your scripts rely on these alternative PHP tags , you 'll need to replace these with the standard PHP opening/closing tags , which are : <h> PHP 7 : Combined Comparison Operator <p> Dubbed the " spaceship operator , " this returns either 1 , 0 or -1 depending on whether both operands are equal to , or if one is greater than or less than the other . That might sound like a handful " but its really rather simple . here 's an example : <p> if ( 1 &lt;==&gt; 1 ) // 0 if ( 1 &lt;==&gt; 0 ) // 1 if ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a number of scenarios e.g. for sorting arrays with usort() . <h> PHP 7 : Null Coalescing Operator <p> This is a really handy new ternary operator " it allows us to return the first operand if it exists or is not NULL , or else its second operand . <p> This might sound very similar to the short ternary ? : operator " and it is " but the problem with that is an ENOTICE error will be raised if the value being checked does not exist ; Heres how the new null coalescing operator works : <p> $username = $users-&gt;username ? ? ' Guest ' ; <h> What did n't  make it to PHP 7 ? <p> There were many features and changes that were tabled for inclusion in PHP 7 that were either rejected or stalled either due to the author withdrawing or lack of consensus . <p> One of the big changes that I was hoping to see approved for PHP 7 was the addressing of inconsistent PHP function names " and this was added as an RFC in March 2015 , but has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I contacted the author of this RFC to ask about the progress and from what the author has told me , it looks like we might see movement in this RFC starting early next year . <p> So what does this RFC intend to address ? The main purpose of the RFC is to create alias functions that are more consistently worded . For example all GD functions use cryptic function names like imagecreatetruecolor() and imagecreatefromgd2part() , and some are less cryptic but clearly inconsistent , like imagetypetoextension() and imagetypetomimetype() . <p> In the case of the functions above , the RFC proposes to create more consistently-worded alias functions like gdcreatetruecolor() , gdcreatefromgd2part() , gdtypetoextension() and gdtypetomimetype() . Its also good to point out the changes this RFC is proposing are completely backwards-compatible , because they will simply be aliases and not sudden drop-in replacements . <p> Ben 's main IT experience is on software , programming , website development and marketing topics including search engine optimisation .

@@14549101 @3149101/ <h> Auto Scaling <p> What is Auto Scaling ? <p> Auto-scaling is an approach that automatically scales up or scales down the number of computing resources , like CPU or RAM that are being allocated to your active application at any given point of time , based on its needs . eNlight Cloud has built-in intelligence to detect increase in resource requirements on a server in real-time , which it adds immediately ; and most importantly , without any downtime . ALL with NO reboot or manual intervention needed ! The server infrastructure setup on eNlight Cloud platform allows resources on Virtual Machines to scale-up or down depending upon the demand . The intelligent tool fetches the necessary resources from a large pool of free resources and allocates those to VMs during predicted as well as unpredicted bursts or spikes , allowing the company or personal website(s) to achieve optimum scalability and perform at optimum levels . Auto scaling responds automatically and ensures that applications continue running smoothly , without any interruptions , no matter how erratic the resource usage patterns maybe . <p> eNlight Cloud scales up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage of resource consumption patterns . The scaling up is a steady but quick and automatic percentage of the pattern as required by your application , and so is the scaling down . It scales down and de-allocates resources to VMs when the demand falls during off peak hours . This ensures that you are only paying for what you use . eNlight Auto Scaling changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for computing resources you actually use . <p> Due to thick provisions of disk on storage " Disk Scaling " is not supported in eNlight however eNlight comes with an extraordinary option called " Elastic Storage " which allows you to add multiple disks on the fly and also attach / detach them between multiple VMs without losing any data . eNlight is the best option for Disaster Recovery Hosting due to this unique feature . <p> Features of Auto Scaling <p> Scale up computing resources seamlessly and automatically as per the demand . <p> Available as a standard feature with eNlight Cloud and carries no additional fees . <p> Performance Models with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access Memory ( RAM ) that a computer accesses more quickly than a regular Disk . The computer , when processing data , first looks in the cache memory that stores information from a previous reading of data and moves on to the much larger memory only if it is not able to retrieve it from the Cache . At times , the cache memory can grow very large unnecessarily reserving most of the RAM to store cache for performance ; this is a normal scenario with Linux OS , to make the execution of a command that has been previously executed , easier . The amount of cache memory on a RAM can have huge implications on the performance of a machine . To make sure that you truly enjoy the freedom that eNlight brings to you , we offer two performance models depending on your preference : <p> Economy based Model : With the economy based model , eNlight Cloud Storage devices are programmed to set a maximum limit to store cache on RAM , to stunt the growth of cache .

As the name suggests the cost of a VM is kept low due to limited resource , compromising performance by accessing data from the disk and not from the RAM . This model suits those customers who has small size of database and does n't require high performance for their dynamic applications plus to keep the VM invoices low . <p> Performance based Model : As a part of the Performance based Model , eNlight ensure a considerably large cache size for the storage devices . This is done to increase performance and to avoid repetition of fetching the same data from the drive several times , so that the future requests can be processed immediately .

It is mostly caused by the use of a counterfeit card with the customers account number . <p> In e-commerce , a charge back refers to the reversal of a credit card transaction . It is usually initiated by the card issuer upon the request of the card holder . The most common reasons of Charge backs are fraudulent and unauthorized activity on the card , customer disputes , and other authorization issues . <p> With the number of online transactions being on the rise , payment frauds have increased drastically . <p> The AVS , or address verification service is a commonly used practice by most ecommerce websites . That 's the reason why every payment page asks for your detailed address . The address acquired is matched with the address entered by the user with what the credit card company has on file . 2 ) CVV : <p> The CVV , which is the security number printed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other details of the card .

With the new 300GB disc set to be launch in summer 2015 , Sony expects to eventually produce discs capable of storing up to 1TB of data in the not too distant future , making Bluray a very viable rival to the long-standing dominance of tape drives for the purpose of archiving information . <p> Summer 2015 launch <p> The new discs are n't set to hit the market until June 2015 , with the 300GB version being the first to make an appearance .

@@14549111 @3149111/ <h> 8 Easy Steps to Increase Your Domain Authority <h> 8 Easy Steps to Increase Your Domain Authority <p> One of the most important factors that search engines use to determine a website 's ranking is Domain Authority . Domain Authority is website metric , ranging from zero to 100 , that is applied to all websites. - Basically , the higher your website 's Domain Authority , the better your chances of ranking higher in search results . In this article , we 'll explain eight easy steps to help you improve the authority of your site . <h> 1 . Select a good domain name <p> A good domain name is important for authority because it helps internet users and search engines understand the nature of your website . For startups who have n't yet created a website , you have the perfect opportunity to choose a domain name that is relevant to your content . For example , if you are a law firm , include the work law in your domain : rather than SmithJonesandBrown.co.uk , call your website sjblaw.co.uk or sjbsolicitors.co.uk . Your domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company name , so you are free to choose something which can have a greater impact on the internet . <p> Domain names should also be easy to remember and simple to type on a mobile phone " so do n't make them too long and try to avoid the use of hyphens or underscores which force mobile users to have to select the symbols function on their keyboard . <h> 2 . Ensure your website 's technical SEO is optimised <p> Technical SEO is important for both search engine ranking and Domain Authority , and this is an area where , as the website 's owner , you have complete control over what you can achieve . To improve your Domain Authority , make sure that you optimise all the relevant areas of your website : title tags , header tags , meta tags , image alt tags , site structure , navigability ( menus ) , breadcrumbs , URL structure , URL length , URL titles ( slugs ) , page word count , keywords , and keyword variations . <h> 3 . Create more likeable content <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority website is the number of backlinks your content receives from other high authority websites . ( Links from poor quality websites can have the opposite effect ! ) These precious backlinks can only be earned through creating great content . For this reason , you should endeavour to regularly post content that is useful to your readers , solves their problems and answers their questions . <p> Doing this will improve the chances of people sharing your posts and pages on social media and linking to them on their own websites . The better the quality of your content , the more likely that other authority sites will link to it . <h> 4 . Develop an authoritative social media profile <p> When it comes to Domain Authority , social media plays an important and growing role . What other people think about your website is an important factor in determining how authoritative your website is , so the more people that like and share your content the better . However , as we mentioned in the section above , this can only be done by creating great content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great content , you also need to give people the opportunity to like and share what they find on your site . To do this you should enable the use of social sharing buttons on your pages and posts . <p> It is also important to engage in a meaningful way with your followers . Using social media for things like customer service , to give advice or to share your charity work , etc. , can enhance your company 's authority . It will also improve your brand 's identity , help increase traffic , encourage more external links from high-quality sites and give you the opportunity to get noticed by leading influencers in your niche . <h> 5 . Eradicate bad and toxic links <p> Whilst high-quality backlinks can do wonders for your Domain Authority , poor quality backlinks can do the exact opposite . They can even cause you to get a Google penalty so your site disappears from search results . Poor quality links are those which are : <p> from link networks ( usually on low authority websites ) <p> in the footers of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blog comments <p> found in forum profiles <p> placed in web or article directories <p> frequently use the same anchor text <p> To eradicate these links , you need to find out where they are coming from . The easiest place to do this is on your Google Search Console . Once you have found any toxic links you have two choices of how to get rid of them . The first choice is to contact the website on which the links are found and ask the webmaster if they would remove them . If this does n't work , you can use the disavow tool on your Google Search Console . Whilst this will not remove the links , it will inform Google that you do not want them to be taken into consideration when it assesses the quality of your site . <p> The other form of bad link which needs to be dealt with is the broken link . If you have broken links internally on your site , you need to either update or remove them . If you have external links pointing to pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect them to a new page rather than having visitors arrive at the 404 error page . <h> 6 . Develop your website 's internal link structure <p> An important but often overlooked element of technical SEO is the use of internal links . Internal links create a user-friendly network across your site that not only benefits the user but enables search engines to better crawl and index your site . <p> Internal links are useful at signposting visitors towards the content they want to read and in this way , they enhance the user experience . Good internal linking should enable visitors to easily find all the relevant information they need , no matter how old the post or where on your site is it located . <p> Another useful aspect of internal links is that they help keep the visitor onsite for longer , increasing your analytics metrics for the number of pages visited and length of session whilst decreasing your bounce rate : all of these metrics can help increase your authority and Google ranking . <p> Internal links can be added manually within the content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading plugins. <h> 7 . Your website must be responsive <p> We now spend more time surfing the internet on mobile devices than we do on computers . In the UK , we spend an average of an hour a day surfing on a computer and two hours surfing on a phone . For this reason , users want mobile friendly websites that they can access on any device no matter where they are browsing . The only solution is to have a responsive website . <p> As most websites are now mobile friendly , those that are not are essentially internet dinosaurs . If you do n't have a responsive site , it is highly likely that you are missing out on two-thirds or your potential visitors and many of those that do land on your site will turn away quickly once they see how difficult it is to read your content . <p> Mobile browsing has become so important that Google now uses mobile friendliness ' as a ranking factor " it even has a mobile-friendly test . <h> 8 . Select a good hosting provider <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . One of the ways this is achieved is through improving the speed of your website . Faster loading websites have higher authority and this can be achieved by choosing a web host that uses fast and reliable servers that are configured to improve loading times . <p> In addition , security is becoming increasingly important in denoting authority and a good web host can provide the robust security needed to monitor and protect your website . Having a secure website reduces the risk of your visitors being scammed , infected or hacked and thus , helps your site achieve a higher Domain Authority . <h> Conclusion <p> Having a high Domain Authority is an important element in helping websites improve their search engine ranking .

The components of a cluster are commonly , but not always , connected to each other through fast local area networks . Clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and/or availability over that of a single computer , while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability . <h> Cluster categorizations <h> High-availability ( HA ) clusters <p> High-availability clusters ( also known as Failover Clusters ) are implemented primarily for the purpose of improving the availability of services that the cluster provides . They operate by having redundant nodes , which are then used to provide service when system components fail . The most common size for an HA cluster is two nodes , which is the minimum requirement to provide redundancy . HA cluster implementations attempt to use redundancy of cluster components to eliminate single points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many operating systems . The Linux-HA project is one commonly used free software HA package for the Linux operating system . <h> Load-balancing clusters <p> Load-balancing is when multiple computers are linked together to share computational workload or function as a single virtual computer . Logically , from the user side , they are multiple machines , but function as a single virtual machine . Requests initiated from the user are managed by , and distributed among , all the standalone computers to form a cluster . This results in balanced computational work among different machines , improving the performance of the cluster system . <h> Compute clusters <p> Often clusters are used primarily for computational purposes , rather than handling IO-oriented operations such as web service or databases . For instance , a cluster might support computational simulations of weather or vehicle crashes . The primary distinction within compute clusters is how tightly-coupled the individual nodes are . <p> For instance , a single compute job may require frequent communication among nodes this implies that the cluster shares a dedicated network , is densely located , and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as Beowulf Cluster . The other extreme is where a compute job uses one or few nodes , and needs little or no inter-node communication . <p> This latter category is sometimes called " Grid " computing . Tightly-coupled compute clusters are designed for work that might traditionally have been called " supercomputing " . Middleware such as MPI ( Message Passing Interface ) or PVM ( Parallel Virtual Machine ) permits compute clustering programs to be portable to a wide variety of clusters . <h> Grid computing <p> Grids are usually computer clusters , but more focused on throughput like a computing utility rather than running fewer , tightly-coupled jobs . Often , grids will incorporate heterogeneous collections of computers , possibly distributed geographically , sometimes administered by unrelated organizations . <p> Grid computing is optimized for workloads which consist of many independent jobs or packets of work , which do not have to share data between the jobs during the computation process . Grids serve to manage the allocation of jobs to computers which will perform the work independently of the rest of the grid cluster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodes , but intermediate results of one job do not affect other jobs in progress on other nodes of the grid . <p> An example of a very large grid is the Folding@home project . It is analyzing data that is used by researchers to find cures for diseases such as Alzheimers and cancer . Another large project is the SETI@home project , which may be the largest distributed grid in existence . It uses approximately three million home computers all over the world to analyze data from the Arecibo Observatory radiotelescope , searching for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence . In both of these cases , there is no inter-node communication or shared storage . Individual nodes connect to a main , central location to retrieve a small processing job . <p> They then perform the computation and return the result to the central server . In the case of the @home projects , the software is generally run when the computer is otherwise idle .

@@14549130 @3149130/ <h> Virtualization and Private Cloud-An Explanation <h> Virtualization and Private Cloud-An Explanation <p> It has been noticed that most of the times , people come-up with questions about virtualization and private cloud server hosting . <p> There are multiple definitions for virtualization and cloud , let us try to understand it in a simpler way . Various types of virtualization techniques are available today , such as hardware virtualization , application virtualization , storage virtualization etc . But from Cloud Hosting point of view , we would be more keen in Hardware virtualization . This technique of Hardware Virtualization enables users to simulate multiple hardware boxes out of one single box . It is helpful in creation of multiple servers from a single hardware box . A hypervisor which is basically a software program is used to achieve it . With the help of virtualization , users can create multiple servers from one and improve the utilization of physical boxes in a data center . This physical box that is used for virtualization is known as the Host , while the simulated virtualized boxes within it are known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hardware boxes as resources . <p> In layman terms Cloud defines something that is unlimited externally located and managed resources available on demand and offers pay as you go type of model . But , not many are aware , this definition goes well with public cloud but for a private cloud this definition needs a little tweaking . The Private cloud architecture , as name itself suggests , is more about the part of an enterprises data center therefore it is termed to be as private . Ideally , it is difficult to apply the characteristic of public cloud as an architecture that offers unlimited resources . Though , Private cloud hosting has some limitations of resources and its allocations . But , one thing about it can be strongly said is that it can offer dynamic and on demand resource allocation , management and pay as you go billing/usages . <p> It is n't always required for a Private cloud to be created using virtualization . Private cloud can be created even without the use of virtualization , but for doing so , one would require massive sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billing and dynamic allocation layer over the resource pool which may be virtualized or non-virtualized , depending on the business requirements . The resources can be virtualized machines , RAM and hard-disk allocated to the machines , network bandwidth etc . Therefore , it would n't be correct to compare virtualization with the private cloud hosting solutions . Though , server virtualization can be utilized as the building blocks for creating private cloud . The diagramatic representation should be helpful in understanding the two : <p> Features of Virtualization : <p> Virtualization enables users to optimize the utilization of resources by emulating multiple resources using one <p> Users can manually manage resources such as upgrades , patches and maintenance etc . <p> It offers users the capability of Manual monitoring and usage <p> It lacks in provisioning of self service commissioning of resources <p> Virtualization is all about infrastructure <p> Features of Private Cloud <p> Private cloud offers the ability to dynamically commission or de-commission the machines and resources <p> It offers automated as well as central management of available resources in the pool <p> An automated management of resources such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Cloud architecture <p> It enables the provisioning of self-service commissioning of resources <p> Private Cloud is everything regarding service delivery <p> By reading this information , we assume that viewers must have gotten a fair idea about virtualization and private cloud .

Then it 's time to focus on your keywords . The foundation of every successful SEO strategy is solid keyword research and in this post , we 'll explain what keyword research is and how to go about it effectively in order to improve your website 's performance . <h> What are keywords and why are they important ? <p> Keywords or key phrases are the terms that people use when searching for things on the internet . They are important because when people search for a term , the search engine looks for web pages which have those words in their content and meta descriptions . The more relevant your website is for those key terms , the more likely you are to rank highly for them . <p> The benefit of this is not just more traffic but better traffic . In other words , the search engine is sending you potential customers , not just random visitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . <p> It is possible to rank for the wrong keywords . You could be getting lots of visitors to your page who are visiting for the wrong reasons simply because your pages are badly optimised. - Good keyword research will help you ensure that you rank for the right terms to get more of the visitors that count . <h> What is keyword research ? <p> To get the right visitors , you have to discover the keywords they use when searching the internet and make sure that you use these on your web pages . For example , if you are selling a bag and describe it as a cross-body bag when your customers are searching for a messenger bag , you wo n't get many visitors . If you know what your customers are searching for and use those terms , then you are more likely to get better results . Keyword research is the process of discovering exactly what terms your customers are using to find your products and services . <h> How to do keyword research <p> The first step in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to rank for . You 'll need to know what products and services you are offering and then think of the terms people will use to find them when searching on the internet . <p> The second stage is to find out which keywords your site is currently being found for . You can do this through your Google Search Console account . <p> The Search Analytics ' section of your Search Console will give you a list of the search terms your website is ranking for . More importantly , it will also tell you , for each keyword listed , how many queries have been made , the position your site ranks at , the number of impressions your website receives and the click through rate . <p> You may be surprised at some of the results and how they differ from the keywords you originally had in mind . <p> Another essential tool is the Google Adwords Keyword Planner . By typing in your product or service , you can find out a list of the most searched-for terms used by people on Google . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of suggested keywords together with their average monthly search volumes over the past 12 months . <p> Using this tool , it is also possible to focus on specific locations , so if you only sold messenger bags in the UK , you could get a list of the keywords most used in the UK and their monthly search volumes . <p> The best way to compare keyword traffic over time is to use Google Trends . In the image below we have used Google Trends to compare two of the keywords suggested by the Keyword Planner , men 's messenger bags ' and messenger bags for men ' . Here are the results . <p> As you can see , messenger bags for men ' has been the most searched-for term over the last 5 years . However , it 's popularity has waned significantly and it is now not much different to men 's messenger bags ' . This would indicate that our imaginary bag company should try to rank for both these terms in order to drive as much traffic as possible in what looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , you should have a detailed list of the most important keywords you need to rank for , including longer key phrases or long-tail ' keywords . <p> The next stage is to prioritise these for your optimisation by asking which are the most important keywords for your business . From here , you should begin creating or updating the content of your website by adding these keywords to the relevant pages . For optimum impact , you should aim to include them in your : <p> Page or post titles <p> In your opening paragraph <p> H2 subheadings <p> Throughout your page 's content ( do n't over optimise ) <p> In meta descriptions <p> One way to help you achieve success is to create separate landing pages for each of the main keywords you want to rank for. - Our made-up bag company , therefore , could have two messenger bag landing pages , one focusing on the keyword men 's messenger bags ' and the other on messenger bags for men ' . <h> Keyword mistakes you should avoid <p> Before choosing your keywords , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new company selling iPhones , for example , it 's unlikely that you are ever going to get on page 1 of Google for the term iPhone 7 . There 's no way Google is going to rank you higher than well-established companies like Apple , Carphone Warehouse or EE . Instead , you need to think of more long tail keywords which might help you rank better , e.g. cheapest UK iPhone 7 contracts . <p> Another mistake many companies make is not getting it right when it comes to plural and singular keyword terms . As you can see in the image below , the term messenger bag ' is searched for far more frequently than messenger bags ' . A simple change from plural to singular in your SEO could double the amount of traffic you receive . <p> Geography can also have an impact on your choice of keywords and this needs to be considered . For example , the most popular keyword for a training shoe is sneaker ' . However , if you are selling only to the UK and use this term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , trainer ' is the predominant term used . Make sure , when doing keyword research , that you use the right keywords for the location in which you sell . If you sell training shoes globally , then have two landing pages , one focused on sneakers ' and the other on trainers ' . <p> The final mistake that companies make is not to measure the impact of their keyword strategy . You should use the Google Analytics and Google Search Console to see if the new keywords you are using are having an impact on your traffic and conversion rates . At the same time , you need to keep an eye on how user behaviour changes . Keywords which are being used today might not be used tomorrow " Google Trends and the Keyword Planner can help you with this . <h> Conclusion <p> Keyword research is the cornerstone of successful on-page SEO . Making sure you use the same terms as those being used by your potential customers is vital to ensure you rank higher for relevant searches .

With the average data centre playing host to a number of different clients , there is bound to be a few clients with whom users have a problem and wish to vent this frustration through a malicious attack . Most malicious attacks take the form of DDoS ( Distributed Denial of Service ) attacks that take place with the intent of inundating the target server with traffic ; with the server unable to handle such volumes of traffic , it will buckle under the pressure and crack . With security strategy now forming a large part of data centre planning , it is important that the right measures are taken to protect network infrastructures from external attacks . <p> Hardware firewall <p> A hardware firewall is often referred to as the most prominent form of security in a network environment , acting as a device that is solely dedicated to protecting the hardware that lies behind it . Hardware firewalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop attacks in their path before they have a chance to reach their intended destination ; this can help with reducing the load on servers behind the firewall because these servers will be responsible for less , thus allowing processing power to be focused on more lucrative business activities . Whilst hardware firewalls are recommended for scenarios where hardware is being used for business critical activities from which an income is derived , during a DDoS attack the protection offered can be very limited . Hardware firewalls are limited in capacity like any other hardware device , so if the firewall is faced with a DDoS attack that is well beyond the amount of bandwidth it is designed to handle then it is likely to succumb to the attack . There are ways around this , such as building a resilient infrastructure capable of handling extremely high volumes of traffic that include anomaly detectors so that bad ' traffic is blocked at the router . <p> Anomaly guard <p> A popular product in the networking industry is the Cisco Anomaly Guard , a device that traffic passes through before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By catching traffic before it gets anywhere near the devices that it is intended for , the device is able to weed out any bad traffic before it can cause issues ; the Anomaly Guard identifies itself as the next hop for such traffic and then drops , therefore neutralising the problem immediately . Network engineers have the flexibility to customise the policies against which Anomaly Guard checks traffic , so if you have received attacks in the past that have fitted a similar pattern then you could have this reflected in your policies to prevent any future attacks . Anomaly Guard is famed for its defence against DDoS attacks and can be used to deflect even multi-gigabit attacks , allowing your network infrastructure to operate normally without any hint of an attack . <p> On-site NOC team <p> Maintaining an on-site Network Operations Centre ( NOC ) team is also vital because this means that if an attack does happen to surpass your initial security measures , there are network engineers available to take steps to mitigate the attack . In some situations where the attack ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ null route the IP address that the attack is being targeted at because whilst this will make the server or websites concerned unreachable , it is the only way of quelling the attack and restoring service to the wider network . Should any damage have been sustained during the attack , on-site engineers will also be able to investigate immediately so that any hardware replacement that is necessary can be performed ; similarly where changes are needed to bring the server back online , these can also be done in order to minimise the amount of downtime that is incurred . <p> As a conclusion , I would say that any business relying on its website to provide a source of income should heavily invest in the supporting network and its security elements in order to best protect themselves and revenue streams in times of attack .

People get excited to buy an incredible domain name at a reasonable price in the hope to re-sell it later on for a profit . Granted , debating the merits of buying and selling high-value domain names is n't the point of this article . The point of this article is to talk more in-depth about expensive domain names and whether they are really all that worth it . There are , after all , big risks in buying one . <h> Why do people buy high-value domains ? <p> This might seem like a fairly simple question , but first let 's consider why people want to buy expensive domains . In most cases it is because of a website or business plan which a particular domain name is perfect for . Most high-value names are domains which are easy to remember , are short or are a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain worth a lot . If a domain name has been treated well by a previous owner , then like a house , it will be worth even more . <p> Having such a domain name might give your business an advantage over the competition .

This is clearly because the owner of the domain name hopes one day that someone will be interested in purchasing it . But there are so many things you need to consider before committing yourself .

Search engines obviously tie rankings to domains ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dropped , domains which have been penalised by search engines will mean even more work for you if search engines have n't lifted any penalties against the domain .

Our Windows web hosting servers are running Coldfusion MX 8 , combined with SQL Server 2005 which provides web developers with excellent high powered options they need for their Cold Fusion development . <p> What is ColdFusion ? <p> ColdFusion is one of the easiest programming languages which allows a user to create powerful server side web applications very quickly with very small codes as compared to other scripting languages like PHP , ASP , ASP.NET etc . It is basically a programming language based on standard HTML ( Hyper Text Markup Language ) and is used to write dynamic web pages . <p> Coldfusion is the name of the server software that supports CFML . It solves day-to-day challenges of web application development by allowing users to create and deliver engaging online applications . <p> ColdFusion is a comprised of mainly two elements : - <p> ColdFusion Server <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFML ) . <p> ColdFusion pages have extension .

ColdFusion 8 introduced three new features like Server Monitor , Multiserver Monitor and Monitoring API to overcome this problem . <p> Server Monitor - This is one of the most important features which helps fine-tune an application to maximize the its performance . One can use Server Monitor to get details of background processing like page processing time , database query performance , memory utilization , execution time , server response time , requests handled per second , Slow active requests , server errors messages , thread usage , database status etc . <p> Multiserver Monitor - Some big organizations use multiple ColdFusion servers and their instances . ColdFusion 8 supports a Multiserver Monitor which provides a subset of information available in the Server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A single application can be used to check the health of all ColdFusion servers in a cluster/network . <p> Monitoring API - This feature allow developer to use inbuilt API 's which can programmatically retrieve all of the data returned by Server Monitor . There are several components like servermonitoring.cfc using which different methods/functions can be called in your existing code to perform Server Monitor tasks . For example , you can use the " getAverageResponseTime " method to get the average response time for the server . <p> PDF features - ColdFusion introduced PDF documents and forms which can generate and interact with printable PDF files . Existing HTML files can be easily converted into Adobe PDF to produce printable output , including headers and footers , multiple page sizes etc . With only few tags , you can combine multiple PDF documents into one PDF package , remove pages from a PDF file , add watermarks , password-protect and encrypt a PDF document , generate thumbnails of PDF pages , and more . PDF forms was introduced in Acrobat 6.0 , ColdFusion 8 allows you to work/manipulate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) features - XHTML , CSS , JavaScript etc. are few technologies are used widely in combination with other scripting languages . Ajax applications are more interactive . ColdFusion 8 simplifies Ajax development with a large collection of new features , tags , and functions to help you quickly build and deliver this new class of application . It supports large set of user interface controls like rich text editors , data grids , and dropdown list boxes which simplifies difficulties of beginners . <p> . NET integration - In previous versions of ColdFusion , there was no native way to integrate existing . Net applications , web services can be used to integrate ColdFusion and .

This is true whether you are a large organisation or someone who has set up a small website to sell a few things in their spare time . To make sure that you understand your legal obligations and to stop you falling foul of the law , this article will explain the legal responsibilities of online businesses that are based in or trade in the UK . <p> There are four main laws that online businesses have to comply with in the UK , these are : <p> The Electronic Commerce ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2002 <p> The Data Protection Act 1998 <p> The Consumer Protection ( Distance Selling ) Regulations 2000 <p> Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 <h> The Electronic Commerce ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2002 <p> The Electronic Commerce Regulations govern the way online businesses communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best to understand customers ' as anyone who uses your website , not just people who buy from you and communication ' as any text or images , either on your website or in other form ( emails , etc. ) which is intended , directly or indirectly , to sell products or services . <p> To comply with the Electronic Commerce Regulations , you must ensure that : <p> your business name and address , company registration number , VAT number and direct contact information ( e.g. email address and phone numbers ) are clearly displayed on your website <p> your website 's clearly displays its terms and conditions ' <p> clear information is provided on prices , tax and delivery charges <p> all orders are acknowledged in writing ( e.g. by email ) <p> any marketing offers and their terms are made clear <p> any communication sent from your company identifies the sender <p> promotional / advertising emails make it obvious they are of a commercial nature <p> unsolicited emails are identified as unsolicited <p> This will clearly have an impact on all online businesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place before you launch your company website . You will need to ensure your business information is on your contact page , that you have a terms and conditions page , that an automatic response email is set up to acknowledge orders and that an email signature is created so that all emails clearly identify the sender . You also need to ensure any e-commerce software is set up so that prices , VAT and delivery charges are clearly seen . <h> Data Protection Act 1998 <p> The Data Protection Act is designed to protect personal- information and it applies to all organisations not just commercial ones . If you collect the personal information of anyone , either internally as an organisation or of visitors to your website , then you are legally required to register with the Information Commissioners Office ( ICO ) and comply with the Data Protection Act . This applies to information collected by any means , not just electronically . You can register by visiting the ICO website , where you will need to name a member of your staff as the official Data Controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection Act you must : <p> register with the ICO <p> only collect personal data if it is important to your business needs <p> ensure all data is securely stored <p> remove personal data if the individual requests it <p> make it clear in your terms and conditions ' what you use the data for and comply with what you state <p> not move any collected data out of the EU without permission from the individual <p> specify in your terms and conditions if any data used by third-party organisations ( such as Google Analytics ) moves outside the EU <p> provide advice to show individuals how to remove their data <p> Again , there is much here which will require putting into place before you launch your website " including further additions to your terms and conditions .

The biggest impact here is to recognise that you have to accept returns , even if the product has been opened . <h> Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 <p> Cookie law popups have been annoying everyone 's browsing experience since they were introduced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time being they are part and parcel of online trading and if you run a website that leaves a cookie on the user 's device , then you are obliged to comply with the revised regulations . <p> Cookies are small text files that enable websites to track how visitors use their sites .

Although you may not have deliberately intended to create cookies on your site , some of the software or plugins you use , such as Goole Analytics , could create them . If you have an online store , your shopping basket software will use cookies to record the customer 's choice of product . <p> If you use cookies you are obliged to : <p> inform every visitor that you use cookies <p> provide information about how you use cookies in your privacy policy <p> inform your users how to turn off cookies ( they can do this themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cookie Law means adding more information to the privacy policy ' section of your terms and conditions ( unless you privacy policy is a separate page . ) In addition , you will need to provide a means of displaying that you use cookies .

Doing so not improves your business reputation but also ensures you do n't end up being prosecuted .

@@14549154 @3149154/ <h> How to ban or block an IP address from visiting my website ? <p> You can make use of . htaccess files in order to block an IP address from accessing your website . A . htaccess is a kind of configuration file that can be used from things like setting password-protected directories , preventing the display of file extensions to , of course , restricting access based on IP . <p> To ban an IP address from accessing your website , create a . htaccess file within your root directory ( usually publichtml or www ) and add the following configuration in the file : <p> order allow , deny deny from 127.0.0.1 allow from all <p> Its pretty simple to understand what 's going on here . " order allow , deny " is specifically in this order so that the allow rules are checked first , and if someone matches a deny rule , their server request is refused ( i.e. they 're blacklisted ) . If you have the order as " deny , allow " , the deny rules are checked first and the allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allow " , the allow rule is evaluated last , so you can imagine what would happen hence , " order allow , deny " evaluates deny rules last . <p> In the example above , were blacklisting 127.0.0.1 . In real use , you 'll need to change this to the IP address in which you want to blacklist . You can , of course , blacklist multiple IP addresses by listing multiple deny rules on a separate line . For example : <p> order allow , deny deny from 127.0.0.1 deny from 127.0.0.1 deny from 127.0.0.1 deny from 127.0.0.1 allow from all <p> If you want to block an entire IP range , you simply exclude a specific octet in the . htaccess rule : <p> order allow , deny deny from 127.0.0 allow from all <p> This will blacklist IP addresses in the range 127.0.0.0 through to 127.0.0.255 . An octet is each part of the IP address ( i.e. 127 , 0 , 0 , 1 ) . <p> Note : If you cant see your . htaccess file listed in your FTP client it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the file starts with a period character . If this is the case , you 'll need to find the option in the menu of the FTP client you are using to show hidden files . <p> In most control panels for Linux- and Windows-based hosting , you can blacklist IPs using a graphical user interface instead of having to do so via a . htaccess text file . In cPanel , go to the IP Deny Manager ( in the Security category ) to blacklist IPs from accessing your website . Just like doing so directly within a . htaccess file , you can specify a complete IP address or a specific range . <p> Note : Be careful when you are blacklisting an IP range . Do n't  blacklist an IP range too broadly if you are concerned of blacklisting genuine visitors .

As the latest and greatest , the new standard addresses many of the problems we 've come to live with under HTTP/1.x . But do n't expect everyone to start jumping over immediately HTTP/1.1 is going nowhere and will be with us for many years to come . <h> Development of HTTP/2 <p> Work started in 2012 with the SPDY networking protocol being chosen as the basis for HTTP/2 . SPDY ( pronounced speedy ) was developed by Google to addresses key performance issues with HTTP . <p> Development and standardisation of the new HTTP/2 protocol is the responsibility of the HTTP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) . Now the IETF has finally signed off on HTTP/2 , it is now headed for official publication as RFCs . <p> SPDY gained significant traction for its performance benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Internet Explorer eventually supporting the protocol . However , now HTTP/2 has been approved Google , Mozilla and Microsoft have announced they will be removing support for SPDY in future versions of their browsers with Google confirming it will strip out support in Chrome by early 2016 . <p> In September 2012 , a significant vulnerability was found with the use of gzip for header compression when used inside of encryption . This was , at the time , the proposed standard way to compress header information with SPDY/2 , since it is a simple and very efficient way to achieve compression . <p> Resulting from the discoveries , the Working Group has created a second standard for HTTP/2 called HPACK ' , which allows us to compress HTTP headers . Suffice to say , HTTP/2 works equally on non-secure connections too HPACK was created so we can securely take advantage of header compression . <h> What 's new in HTTP/2 ? <p> First and most importantly : the methods , status codes and semantics are the same as HTTP/1.1 , so no changes are needed to web applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits it offers . The major changes are largely performance-oriented . <p> Any web developer will know the painstaking work it takes to reduce the number of network requests a client needs to make to fully render a web page . This is because HTTP requests are expensive and take up valuable time . What 's more , browsers have to examine each response and make subsequent requests when it needs multiple files to fully complete the rendering of a web page . It sounds tiring , does n't it ? Surely there is a better solution in sight , right ? <p> Finally , HTTP/2 will allow servers to push content even if the client does not request it at the time . For example , if a client is requesting an HTML document from the server and the document relies on a stylesheet for its appearance , we can supply the stylesheet with the original request saving time by avoiding the browser making another request for the stylesheet later on . <p> What 's more , HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed , meaning multiple request and response messages can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if a prior request is still outstanding , it wo n't hold up other requests that can be processed quicker by the server ( e.g. , requests for dynamic content will take longer than serving up static resources ) . <p> Another important difference is all requests and responses over HTTP/2 are in binary rather than plaintext , so we will no longer be able to dissect HTTP messages through Telnet .

@@14549165 @3149165/ <h> All About RAM <h> All About RAM <h> What is RAM ? <p> Random Access Memory or RAM , is the place where the computer stores its programs that are currently in use- and being worked upon . RAM is the polar opposite of a hard-disk in the sense that a hard-disk stores all the programs and data irrespective of the computer being switched on or- off . However , unlike the disks , the contents of the RAM are erased the moment you switch off the computer . <h> How much do I need ? <p> You can never have enough of money , you would never have enough of RAM , especially if your computer uses a lot of memory intensive work , gaming or streaming . Next to the CPU itself , RAM is the most important factor in computer performance . If you do n't  have enough , adding RAM can make more of a difference than getting a new CPU ! As for the exact need of RAM , it depends on the kind of actual work you intend to carry- out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " light " operations like browsing , MS-Office , emails and flow charts etc , - you will not need too much of it . However , the moment computer aided design , dream-weaver , FTP and stuff like that comes in , your RAM requirement shoots up . <h> Why do I need to upgrade , does it work ? <p> If your system responds slowly or accesses the hard drive constantly , then you need to add more RAM . Upgrading your RAM is often the first thing which you can do to speed up your computer . If insufficient RAM is available in your computer , modern operating systems will copy data from RAM to the hard disk . Your hard drive is much slower than RAM , so your entire computer will slow down . <p> The Virtual Memory Manager or VMM is a component which gives the RAM high importance . To a certain extent , upgrading your RAM will help your computer to run faster on a select few types of operations and functionalities . Everytime you run a program or a- web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file for the program on the hard-disk and then loads it into the RAM . The amount of RAM consumed depends on the size of the programs executable file . The processor also calls all the DLLs which would be required for that program(s) to run . These DLLs take up more RAM memory . Thereafter , the processor loads the data files which would be required for the applications to run . Again , these files too occupy RAM space . After all these , when the actual application runs , it again asks for RAM , the more instances , the greater RAM you need . Big applications can easily take up 100MB of RAM . Multiple instances of tapped browsers are known to be " RAM intensive . <p> Moreover , the operating system also requires RAM space to work . All these things put together , the RAM which you have on your machine may not prove to be sufficient . Have you ever thought about how is the extra RAM which is needed come from ? How does the RAM you have on the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done by the virtual memory manager . The VMM system scans the RAM and searches for sectors which are emtpy or not needed in the current operations of applications . This additional space which has been acquired is then put in a place we call " Swap " on the hard-disk . For instance , if you are working on a specific task which requires multiple browsers to be open and at the same time , and/or a couple of MS-Excel sheets open , but have not used it for about 30 minutes ; the VMM will remove all the space occupied by Excel , its DLLs and the data to the hard-disk . The next time you want Excel , the VMM will remove some other unused or idle process and load excel back into the RAM memory . This is called swapping of programs . But this process sometimes takes time and you can actually " feel " the swap happening because the hard-disk is slower compared to a RAM . <p> If you have a very small amount of RAM ( say , 256 megabytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out to get anything done . In that case , your computer feels like it is crawling . As you add more RAM , you get to a point where you only notice the swapping when you load a new program or change windows . If you were to put 2 gigabytes of RAM in your computer , the VMM would have plenty of room and you would never see it swapping anything . That is as fast as things get . If you then added more RAM , it would have no effect . <p> If the RAM you have is indeed very low ( say 512MB ) , then the Virtual Memory Manager is constantly swapping data to facilitate functioning of the different programs and applications . This is when you feel like the computer is slower than a snail and will lose a sprint race to a turtle . When you add more RAM , more often that not , you only see the swapping whenever a new application or program is loaded and / or you change windows . However , in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the VMM would have a lot of space and one would not feel or see the swapping of data happening . If , after this , you add more RAM , it would not be of much use . Its then time for you to upgrade your processor rather the computer itself .

And these are not the only household names to get stung by cyber criminals over the last few years : eBay , TK Maxx , Sony , JP Morgan , Staples and Adobe have all fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that are finding themselves under attack , either . According to Symantec , 66% of targeted cyber-attacks are on SMEs and the UK is second only to the USA in terms of the numbers of attacks .

Depending upon the nature of the attack , your entire online operations can be closed down ; the personal data of customers , partners and employees can be stolen and sold on to third party criminals ; business banking data can be exploited and malicious software can be hidden on your system to infect the technology people use to visit your site . <h> Types of hacks and how they can be protected against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , below we cover some of the more common attacks and how you can protect against them . <h> Social engineering <p> In social engineering , the main vulnerability that hackers exploit is people . Hackers use a variety of techniques to manipulate people into to either divulging sensitive information directly or by installing malicious software on a machine on their PC . <h> Common examples of Social engineering include : <h> 1 . Phishing . <p> One of the most common and well known tactics where scam emails contain links which , when clicked on , either install malware or take the victim to a specially grafted website that is then used to extract information such as usernames and passwords. <h> 2 . Baiting . <p> This is where infected devices , like USB drives , are left in offices in the hope someone will plug it in to see what 's on the drive , software on the drive can be configured to either auto run or trick the staff member into executing a file thus infecting the target machine . <h> 3 . Pretexting . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trick the staff member into divulging sensitive information , for example an attacker may call pretending to be a manager requesting a password reset , often an elaborate back story will be provided and will often involve sweet talking ' or bullying ' the victim into bypassing security procedures . <h> How to protect your business from social engineering attacks . <p> The solution to preventing attacks by social engineering is to have water tight procedures and well trained staff . <h> 1 . Educate Yourself . <p> Keep yourself up to date on the latest developments in cyber-crime and the types of attacks that are perpetrated , hackers are constantly evolving and developing new techniques so it is important you keep on top of the latest developments . <h> 2 . Have a security policy in place . <p> Have a written security policy and make sure all staff understand it , many organisations now require employees to sign a security policy . Procedures need to be kept up-to-date to deal with the changing face of cyber-attacks and should follow the guidelines laid down in the data Protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given induction training and existing staff need refresher courses when new procedures need to be followed . <h> 3 . Promote awareness . <p> Make sure staff are made aware of any new techniques hackers are using and how they can identify and protect against them . Have procedures in place for staff to report any suspicious activity , hackers may make multiple attempts until they can find a member of staff they can <p> manipulate into getting what they want , by encouraging staff to report suspicious activity you can take preventative action . <h> 4 . Do n't be afraid to challenge somebody . <p> Whether it is an onsite visitor or a caller , staff should never be afraid to challenge somebodies identify . One common technique is for the hacker to put pressure on the target through either a false sense of urgency , perceived seniority or just plain persistence , it is important staff stick to procedure and do n't succumb to these pressures . <h> 5 . Lead by example . <p> As a manager it can be tempting to have the staff break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so leads to complacency which can negate any prior training that has been given to staff . <h> Server vulnerabilities <p> Server vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the operating system and/or software installed on the server either as the result of a poor security policy , software misconfiguration or bug . <p> Successful attacks against a vulnerable server are often disastrous for the target as the end result is nearly always full unrestricted access to the server for the attacker . <h> Common attacks of this type include : <h> 1 . Brute force attacks . <p> These target services that require username and password authentication to access the service , for example SSH on Linux and RDP on Windows servers are common targets . <p> These types of attacks tend to be automated and have become more sophisticated of time , as more and more password data has become available to hackers through previous successfully hacks patterns have emerged into how humans select passwords , these patterns have been exploited to greatly increase the success rates of brute force hacks . <h> 2 . Software Exploits . <p> Modern software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code , as a result there are bugs in most software some of which can be exploited to allow hackers to gain access to a server . <p> It is a never-ending race between hackers and software developers to locate these bugs , in the case of the software developers so they can patch vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by hackers while the hackers off course want to find them first to exploit them for as long as possible until they are patched . <p> One recent example of this was the Heartbleed bug which potentially allowed hackers to exploit weaknesses in website encryption to obtain login information , there was a significant period between the bug being found and a patch being released so mitigation was a priority . <h> How to protect against server vulnerabilities <p> Having a thorough security policy in place in place is key to keeping your server secure , below are some of the ways you can achieve this : <h> 1 . Put in place a firewall policy . <p> Many attacks can be avoided altogether by simply ensuring vulnerable services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access ports can be restricted so they are only available from trusted locations ( for example your company offices ) , hackers ca n't target a service they ca n't see online . <p> Only ports that absolutely must be publically available to deliver your services should be unrestricted , for example in the case of a server that is used only to deliver a website this would consist of just HTTP ( 80 ) and HTTPS ( 443 ) ports , all other ports should be either locked down completely or only accessible via trusted IP addresses . <h> 2 . Enable Intrusion prevention systems ( IDS/IPS ) . <p> Intrusion prevention systems monitor network traffic or service logs for suspicious activity and stop any attempted intrusion . If a hacker is bombarding your site with thousands of attempts to log in , these systems can quickly find out the source of the attack and block the IP address of the attacker . At eUKhost , we think these systems are so important that they are pre-enabled on our all servers that have the latest versions of Plesk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in place . <p> It is good practice to have an update and patching policy ; at eUKhost , it 's a standard part of the management service we provide for our customers . Software updates and patches are not only issued by developers to fix bugs but also to address security vulnerabilities which have recently come to light , so it 's important they are kept up-to-date . <h> 4 . Ensure you have a password policy in place . <p> A good password policy is also important for increasing security . Ensuring everyone has strong passwords which are changed on a regular basis and kept secret is standard practice for most organisations these days . It 's an easy but effective way to reduce the chances of being hacked . Both Plesk and cPanel have controls built in that can be used to enforce minimum password strengths . <h> 5 . Be careful when installing new server software . <p> With modern package managers such as YUM &amp; APT installing software is often a very easy task , however , configuring software securely for a production environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy to leave software open to exploitation , for example forgetting to change a default password . <p> If you are an eUKhost client and are unsure about how to configure a software package then please contact our management team and they will be happy to advise . <p> By doing the above the majority of attacks can be either avoided altogether or greatly mitigated , if you want the very best in protection then invest in a hardware based firewall such as our own Fortigate security appliance , this unifies firewall services , IDS/IPS , malware protection , application firewall and DDoS protection into single devices that can protect multiple servers . <p> eUKhost management services also include free consultancy to help clients develop an appropriate security policy for their specific needs . <h> Application &amp; Website Vulnerabilities <p> Unfortunately , it 's not just your server which is vulnerable to attack ; sometimes it 's the applications that you run on it . This is especially the case with common platforms used to build websites , like WordPress and Magento . According to Alexa , 70% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack and there are three main attack vectors that hacker exploit to gain access : poorly configured servers ; weak usernames and passwords to the admin panel or FTP account ; and software vulnerability , such as using older versions of the platform or plugins. <h> 1 . Cross-site scripting . <p> Here , the hacker inserts malicious code onto a link on your website so that , when one of your visitors clicks on the link , malware infects their computer and allows information to be stolen . <p> As the attackers is targeting your visitors this can have a disastrous effect on your reputation and will often result in your site being blacklisted and blocked by search engines . <h> 2 . SQL injection . <p> Where a hacker will find a form that needs to be filled in on your website , such as a newsletter subscription form , but instead of typing in a name and email address , they will type in SQL computer code that allows them access to your database . From here they can potentially download all the information stored on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man in the middle . <p> In a man in the middle attack the hacker intercepts communication between your website the visitor . One example of how this works is when malware is sent from your website to the visitor 's browser . Once installed , the visitor is then redirected to a different site that looks just like yours . Any information they then provide is given , unwittingly , to the hacker . <h> How to protect against application vulnerabilities <p> Failure to protect vulnerable applications from being exploited can have seriously damaging consequences and so preventing an attack should be a priority . To do this there are a number of things you need to do . <h> 1 . Keep your application up to date . <p> Firstly , you should keep your application and any associated plugins up-to-date . If you are a WordPress user and you have a control panel that uses Plesk 12 or higher this is made easier through the inbuilt WordPress hardening and update tools , these allow you to security check every plugin and software update so that vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and WordPress now come with version checking tools however these tend to require running manually so check often for updates . <h> 2 . Follow best practice guidelines . <p> Most application include best practice guidelines for security , read these carefully and apply any recommendations . <h> 3 . Sign up for the developer 's mailing list or Forum . <p> Most application developer sites have security related mailing lists or forums , sign up to these and act upon any recommendations . <p> When vulnerabilities are found it can take time before a patch is released , often developers will provide information via their mailing list or forum detailing how to mitigate the issue in the meantime . <h> 4 . Protect vulnerable areas of your website using . htaccess files . <p> If you use Apache then a great line of defence is to use . htaccess files to protect the vulnerable areas of you website such the admin interface . This can be used for a wide range of security measures including : preventing access to databases , stopping hackers being able to browse your directories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting access to your admin area to specific IPs. <h> 5 . Enable Intrusion prevention systems ( IDS/IPS ) . <p> Both Plesk &amp; cPanel come with intrusion prevention system that can be configured for certain applications , for example fail2ban built into Plesk has predefined rulesets for WordPress which can be enabled . <h> 6 . Enable an application firewall . <p> Application firewalls work by using predefined ruleset to sanitise or block HTTP requests that do not conform to the rules , for example if a request includes an SQL query which should not be part of HTTP request ( SQL injection ) the firewall will block the request before it is executed by your application . <p> The most widely known application firewall is modsecurity which is now built into Plesk and cPanel on our Linux servers and comes with a number of custom ruleset that can be enabled . <p> When properly configured an application firewall can be extremely effective at blocking cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks . <h> 7 . Enable site wide SSL <p> Encryption is another layer of security that will prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSL , ( Secure Sockets Layer ) you can easily establish an encrypted link between a server and a client . This will help keep personal data , credit card information and passwords safe during transmission thus preventing man in the middle attacks . <p> It should be noted that the google now provide a ranking boost for sites using site wide SSL so this is another reason to enable this . <h> 8 . Use a vulnerability scanner . <p> By using a vulnerability scanner such as our own MTv scan , these will undertake a deep scan of your website for known vulnerabilities , malware and intrusions as well as check your website 's reputation and see whether your website and email addresses have been blacklisted . As a result , this prevents infection and helps resolve issues with your website 's authority across the internet. <h> 9 . Backup regularly . <p> The final thing you should do is to regularly back up your files . Should the worst ever happen and you find your site has been hacked , the files on your server may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up it means that restoring your website can be an easy thing to do . If you do n't , you may have to rebuild the website from scratch : programs , content and database . <h> In Summary <p> Of course , the easiest solution to prevent hacking is to ensure you choose a web host that provides robust and comprehensive security . At eUKhost , all our VPS , enterprise cloud and dedicated servers come with management services that can be called upon to harden servers and protect against attacks . <p> If you are concerned about your website security and want to know how eUKhost can help protect your business , call us on 0800 862 0380 or click the live chat button at the top of the page . @qwx190776

@@14549174 @3149174/ <h> Apple Unveils OSX 10.10 Yosemite , iOS 8 <h> Apple Unveils OSX 10.10 Yosemite , iOS 8 <p> Apple has today announced the details of the next iterations of its desktop and mobile operating systems , Mac OSX 10.10 and iOS 8 , in the keynote at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) . Rather than version numbers , Mac OSX is better known for the quirky names that Apple regularly adorns to new releases of its desktop OS ; OSX 10.9 was known as Mavericks , whilst the hardware and software company has chosen to name its latest release Yosemite . Whilst 2013 was the year of iOS with the release of a radical new design , 2014 is the year of OSX with the release of a new design that has taken certain cues from iOS 7 and introduced a swathe of new features aimed at simplifying the ways in which Apple devices communicate with one another . <h> The design of OSX <p> In 2013 we saw Apple do away with the skeuomorphism that had plagued OSX and iOS whilst under the reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more real-world look , in reality these designs just looked tacky and did little to recreate the materials that they were meant to represent . This year Apple has taken this design purge one step further by introducing a much flatter design for OSX , mimicking the design of iOS 7 that was released last year . OSX and iOS now compliment each other to a much higher degree . Another improvement is that a lot has been done to let users control what is going on around them without having to leave the application that they are using , something that could be a bonus for those that are likely to have a lot of windows open at the same time . <h> Continuity <p> In my opinion one of the best features of the new operating systems has to be what is being dubbed as Continuity ' , which in simple terms means that you can start an activity on one device and the continue it on another device ; for example , you may start writing an email on your iPhone as you 're about to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for you to continue once you 're logged on . <p> Work that is being completed on Apple apps on your computer can also be transferred to your iPhone or iPad seamlessly . This means that you can continue work on the move if you have to leave quickly and forget to save the file for example ; examples of apps that this will be possible with include Keynote and Pages . Whilst some features can sometimes be dismissed as gimmicks , this is something that I could see being beneficial in the real world as previously the steps that needed to be taken to work on something across multiple devices have stopped many people from seeing this as a realistic option . <h> Create a mobile hotspot without touching your phone <p> If like me you rely on your iPhone or cell-enabled iPad to provide you with a mobile hotspot when you 're out and about , then the new degree of interaction between your Mac and iOS devices will allow you to startup a mobile hotspot without even having to touch the iOS device . Granted starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of an issue , but being able to spark one up from the comfort of your Mac seamlessly will make things just that bit easier and saves you from having to fish around in the bottom of your bag for your phone . <h> AirDrop support extended <p> AirDrop , the OSX feature that enables Mac users on a local network to share files between one another seamlessly , is now supported by iOS . Previously transferring files from an iOS device to an OSX desktop computer has been a time consuming task involving USB cables and whatnot , but with AirDrop , images and documents can now be shared between the two seamlessly over a local network without the need for any physical connection between the two devices . <p> I would say that Apple is going in the right direction with the new OSX design and the introduction of Continuity for the two systems . As systems that have been separated by a fairly large gap for a long time , Apple has done a lot to bridge this gap to create one universal system that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a plane , or down the park . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> HTTP Referrer or Referrer <p> HTTP Referrer or Referrer The referrer ( referer , or HTTP referrer ) is simply the URL of an element that leads to the current : for example , the referrer of an HTML page may be another HTML page .

@@14549181 @3149181/ <h> 10 Ways to Improve Trust and Boost Sales <h> 10 Ways to Improve Trust and Boost Sales <p> If you want to sell products and services over the internet , then it 's important that consumers feel they can trust you . Online shoppers are increasingly sceptical about where they spend their money and any signs that your website looks dodgy will make them think twice . In this article , we 'll look at ten different ways you can increase trust in your website so that customers feel more confident to shop with you . <h> 1 . Online Reviews <p> One of the most effective ways to increase trust in your business is to use online reviews " mainly because they are the opinions previous customers and they are independent . According to Vendasta , 92% of consumers now read reviews with the star rating being the primary way they judge a business . Indeed , for local businesses , 68% of people state directly that reviews increase trust . <p> There are numerous ways that your business can start to use reviews . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them from websites like Yell or Google My Business when you list your company on those sites , or you can sign up to use a service like TrustPilot . <p> To make the most of the reviews , you need to get your customers to leave them and this may take a little encouragement on your behalf . However , once good reviews start coming in , you should put your star rating on your website and make sure that customers see it in the most appropriate places . In addition , you should put a link to the reviews you have received so that potential customers can read them for themselves . <h> 2 . Customer testimonials <p> Customer testimonials are similar to reviews with the exception that they are published directly on your website . You should use them as a way to show how your product or service was appreciated by the customer and the benefits it brought . The more influential , high profile or relevant the person leaving the testimonial , the better . So , if you sell equipment to schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the headteacher of Eton , even better . <p> To make sure people believe that your testimonials are real and not just made up , you should always ask the person giving the testimonial to provide their name , position and organisation , such as Brad Smith , Managing Director , Brad 's Bikes . This way , those that feel the need to do so can look the person up on Google " you 'd be surprised how many do this . <h> 3 . Portfolio / Case Studies <p> Although it might not be appropriate for every company , having a portfolio and case studies on your website is another way to boost trust . They highlight the work you have done in the past , proving that you are an established company with experience . They are also a way of the letting your customers see the high standards your company works to . <p> Portfolios are excellent for businesses that create things with a visible end result , e.g. wedding planners , photographers , builders , jewellery makers , gardeners " the list is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer services that have an impact on customers " they are a way to demonstrate the problems you helped the customer overcome , the way you achieved this and the improvements that came around because of the work you did . <h> 4 . Contact details <p> One of the biggest advantages of shopping on the high street is that people know where to go if there is a problem . There is a building with people in it . Nothing inspires trust as much as that . <p> Whilst you can not have a bricks and mortar website , you can do the next best thing and provide your customers with everything they need to know to make them trust that your business is legitimate . <p> The essential details are these : <p> Company Name <p> If a registered company , also give the company registration number so you can be checked as legitimate at Companies House . <p> Company address , in full including country if you sell overseas . <p> Company telephone number " landlines are far more trustable than mobile numbers . <p> Email address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( @hotmail.com or @gmail.com does n't inspire the same trust . ) <p> In addition , you should also aim to use live chat so people can speak with you there and then ; show your location on a map , preferably with an image of your business so people can see it is real ; and where appropriate , have a Meet the Team ' page with headshots , brief bios and contact emails. <h> 5 . About Us page <p> A properly written About Us page can do wonders to build trust in your business . It should not only give a brief description of the history of the business and the products and services you offer but should also include sections on your business ' ethos and goals . <p> These latter sections are where you can drive home the message that you are there to help and benefit both the consumer and the wider society . Perhaps you can inspire trust by showing your green credentials or your commitment to a local charity or community . People are much more likely to trust companies that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of 2017 , Google 's Chrome browser has warned visitors that sites which do not have an SSL certificate are not secure . If you do n't have SSL , this could cause anyone trying to buy from your website to reconsider their purchase . <p> If you are not sure what this means , SSL is a way of encrypting sensitive information , such as credit card details , so that it can not be stolen as it is sent from the buyer 's computer to your server . With hacking on the rise , consumers are becoming much more reluctant to spend when they do n't have complete trust in your services " that last thing you need is for Google to tell them your site is not safe . <h> 7 . Payment Options <p> It 's not just SSL that affects people at the point of sale either . Another factor that can stop a purchase at the last minute is the merchant you use to take payments . For example , PayPal is widely known and used by millions of people , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to make customers feel more comfortable . <p> If you offer payment via other services , try to use a company that people are familiar with and will have trust in , such as World Pay . If you sell primarily to the UK , then using a UK based merchant can help create trust as it will be authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority and provide customers with the rights and guarantees they expect . <h> 8 . Make your legal obligations clear <p> Make sure that you have all your policies clearly accessible on your website and that they are written in plain English . This way customers can be reassured about the way your business operates . You should include the following : <p> Fraudulent websites often do n't have these at all , so it is always a good idea to publish them . At the same time , the more customer friendly these policies are , the more likely you are to make a sale . <h> 9 .

Obviously , this can have a negative effect on sales and needs to be remedied quickly . The best way to do this is to employ a freelance copywriter to check your content for you and rectify any mistakes . <h> 10 . Membership of professional associations <p> The final way to build trust with your audience is to prove that you are a member of a relevant professional association . For example , if someone was looking for a central heating engineer they would expect you to be CORGI registered , similarly , if they were looking for a travel agent or holiday they would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are professional organisations for most lines of business and their job is to make sure standards are upheld and that consumers are protected .

It can also be used to point a number of subdomains to the primary domain name . <p> For example , you have a website called computer(dot)com . You also have several subdomains such as **25;1930;TOOLONG , my(dot)computer(dot)com and files(dot) computer(dot)com . You wish to point all these subdomains to the main domain name - computer(dot)com . So , rather than adding an A record for all the three subdomains , you will only add an A record for the main domain name and update CNAME record for the subdomains . <p> Record Type <p> Address <p> A record <p> xx.xx.xx.xx ( IP Address ) <p> CNAME <p> **25;1957;TOOLONG <p> CNAME <p> my(dot)computer(dot)com <p> CNAME <p> **26;1984;TOOLONG <p> Whenever you switch servers , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the subdomains . You will only have to update the IP address ( A record ) for the main domain . The subdomains will automatically point to the main domain name . This is just an example of 3 subdomains . Let 's assume you have 100 subdomains pointing to the main domain name . I reckon it would be a tedious job to update A record for 100 subdomains Hence , CNAME records do save a lot of time and ease up the tiresome job . <p> Note : You can follow the above process if you want the subdomains and main domain to point to one server . If you want your main domain to work from X server and the subdomains to work from Y server , then you will have to manually update the A record of Y server for each and every sub domain name . <p> 3 . URL Redirect : When you redirect your website to another website , the URL in the browser changes to the one of the new website . The data of the new website is displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a redirect for tom(dot)com to peter(dot)com . Whenever any user types tom(dot)com in the browser , he will be redirected to peter(dot)com . He will view the web pages ( data ) uploaded for peter(dot)com . The URL in the browser will also change from tom(dot)com to peter(dot)com . This option is mostly used to redirect the traffic from one website to another . <p> 4 . MX Records : MX is an abbreviation for Mail Exchanger . Mx Record is not alike the A or CNAME record . It 's setup to point the emails for your domain name . The records specify the mail server which is supposed to send and receive emails for a domain name . <p> For instance , when you send an email to email protected(dot)com , the email will first travel to the mail server of your ISP . The mail server will then try to identify which server is responsible for sending and receiving emails for example(dot)com . This will be done by sending a DNS request for MX records for example(dot)com . The DNS servers will then respond by providing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Internet Service Provider will send the email to the mail server of example(dot)com by picking up it 's IP address . This way , the email will be delivered to the mail server of example(dot)com . The mail server of example(dot)com will then deliver the email to the mailbox - email protected(dot)com . <p> 5 . URL Frame : URL Frame is somewhat similar to URL redirect . It will direct the visitor to another website . However , the URL in the browser will remain the one that he typed initially . The URL wo n't change . <p> For instance , you wish to forward tom(dot)com to peter(dot)com . Once you setup URL Frame , tom(dot)com will show up the data of peter(dot)com . However , the URL in the browser will show up tom(dot)com . It wo n't change to peter(dot)com . <p> How to update the records from the ENOM reseller account / Domain control panel ? <p> Once you search the domain name in your ENOM reseller account , you will find an option ' Host Records ' under Domain Overview . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A ( Address ) ' from the drop down list under ' Record Type ' . In the ' Address ' field , you will have to enter the IP address as shown in the following screenshot . If you want to point the website with www to the IP address , then you will have to check the box beside www under Host Name . Once you enter the IP address and select A record from the Record type , you may click on " Save " . Your website is now pointing to an IP address . The changes may take a few hours to reflect . <p> Similarly , you can update the CNAME record . You will have to select ' CNAME ' under the Record Type . Except for the IP Address , you will have to enter the other website name / sub domain name under the ' Address ' field . <p> For URL redirect , you will have to select URL redirect and enter the other websites name in the Address field . <p> The Host Records option wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servers " under DNS Server Settings and click on Save button . You can either update the nameservers or host records at one time . You can not update both at the same time . <p> If you do n't have the login details for access.enom.com ( ENOM 's domain control panel ) , you may contact the Billing department . They will provide you the login details for your domain name

AMP is an important innovation that let 's mobile users access website content at blisteringly fast speed . For WordPress users , AMP is not something you can ignore : take advantage of it and you are likely to see your mobile rankings rise ; however , it 's not without its issues . In this post , we will take a closer look at Accelerated Mobile Pages and the implications it has for WordPress users . <h> What is Accelerated Mobile Pages ? <p> Accelerated Mobile Pages is a Google project that aims to make static content load almost instantaneously on mobile devices . Google 's motivation for this comes from the shift in the way people now search the internet . In the UK , 66% of our surfing is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of this is hampered by frustratingly slow downloads caused by low-quality Wi-Fi hotspots or poor network connections . <p> Quite rightly , Google refuses to accept this poor user experience as the norm , but as it ca n't singlehandedly create the necessary network infrastructure , its only solution is to encourage ' webmasters to create content that will load quicker . AMP achieves this by helping us squeeze every unnecessary byte of data out of our web pages . <h> How does AMP work ? <p> The best way to speed up loading times s to reduce the weight of your pages . Whilst WordPress users can currently use compression and minifying plugins to help with this , AMP is able to achieve much faster loading by utilising modified versions of HTML and JavaScript . <p> The AMP version of HTML , for example , has restrictions which ensure better performance whilst its JavaScript library works to render the HTML pages more quickly . There is also a Google AMP Cache- which can be used to serve AMP cached pages directly to mobile devices . <h> How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pages load much quicker on mobiles , the downside is that its versions of HTML and JavaScript limit some of the more useful functions , such as forms , that many web pages now feature . <p> This is not totally bad news . When you use AMP , you actually create an alternative version of your existing web page . The AMP page is only served to mobile devices ; your non-AMP version will still be served to users on PC and laptops . If you have essential content which ca n't be served as an AMP page , you do n't have to create an AMP version of it and mobile users will still be able to access it . <h> Why is AMP important for WordPress Users ? <p> Essentially , AMP is for simple , static web pages where the focus is very much on content . In other words : blogs , news and general web pages that are frequently found on WordPress sites . Bearing in mind that WordPress is the world 's most used platform and that its reliance on plugins has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it looks as if AMP has been created with the intention of speeding the platform up . <h> How will AMP affect WordPress Users ? <p> The fact that Google already uses mobile-friendliness and page speed as ranking factors should give WordPress users a clear indication that using AMP is going to be an expectation , especially for sites with lots of static content . <p> Early adopters of AMP will no doubt see their mobile rankings much boosted and this will give them a distinct advantage over their competitors . It wo n't take long , though , for algorithm analysts and SEO authorities to put AMP near the top of everyone 's to-do list . <p> With this in mind , if you have a WordPress site , then Accelerated Mobile Pages really are n't an option you can afford to ignore and the sooner you implement AMP the better . <h> How can you use AMP on your website ? <p> If you have lots of static content and want to employ Accelerated Mobile Pages , you will need to create alternative AMP versions of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ header . Doing this enables Google to find , cache and serve the posts to mobiles . <p> The good news for WordPress users is that you can install a plugin ( see below ) - that will create AMP pages automatically for you . <h> How to implement Accelerated Mobile Pages- on your WordPress site <p> With 27% of the world 's websites built using WordPress , it 's no surprise that there is an official Google plugin for Accelerated Mobile Pages . This is good news indeed , because implementing AMP manually can be a challenging process . <p> The- Google AMP plugin , which is free and can be installed directly from your Admin Panel , works by automatically generating AMP versions of your posts . It 's exceptionally easy to use " all you have to do is install and activate it and you 're done " the process is completed . <p> Once activated , you should view your posts on a mobile device to make sure that they are working and displaying in a way that is acceptable . You can also access AMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing URLs , for example , **26;2012;TOOLONG <p> Another test you should run is to do a before and after speed test , using Google PageSpeed Insights , to see how mobile performance has been improved by AMP . <h> Issues with the AMP plugin <p> As we mentioned in the introduction , AMP is not without its issues and here are two that you need to consider . Firstly , at the moment , the plugin only works with posts ; it does n't cater for pages and custom-post-types . This is probably because much of the content that can be speeded up on WordPress is to be found in posts . However , it probably wo n't take long for other developers to bring our plugins or extensions which cater for other content types . <p> The other issue is APM 's CSS limitation " there is only one style available , which might not be to everyone 's liking as it means many of the pages it serves will look pretty much the same . However , there is another plugin from the highly respected Yoast team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's you customise the styling of your AMP posts whilst optimising them for SEO and enabling you to link them to Google Analytics at the same time . <h> Conclusion <p> Accelerated Mobile Pages is both good news and bad news for WordPress users . The good news is that if you opt to use the plugin and create AMP versions of your pages , they will load much faster on mobile devices . This will no doubt give you a big thumbs-up from both users and the guys in the Google algorithm team and it may even boost your mobile rankings . What 's far more likely is that if you do n't use them then your mobile rankings will suffer . <p> The bad news , at least for the time being , is that the bells and whistles you 've added to your content to make it unique , fancy fonts and flashy forms , et al , are n't going to feature much on mobile screens . <p> If you are a WordPress user looking for dedicated WordPress web hosting , visit our- WordPress Hosting- page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx190775 <h> 5 SEO Tips for Optimising WordPress Posts <p> Search engine optimisation ( SEO ) is the act of making your web content easy for search engines to find and understand .

@@14549189 @3149189/ <h> 10 Tips for Choosing the Right Web Host <h> 10 Tips for Choosing the Right Web Host <p> One of the most important decisions you make when setting up a website is choosing a web host . The many different types of service and the wide range of packages on offer can leave a newcomer bamboozled when it comes to selecting the right service provider . To help you out , this post will give you an insight into the most important criteria you need to consider . <h> 1 . Availability <p> Availability is the technical term used in the industry for reliability and what you need to look for is a web host that can offer high availability . In other words , they will guarantee that your website will stay online and wo n't fail due to errors with their servers or be taken offline for long periods during maintenance . <p> The industry standard for availability is 99.5% but this still equates to your website being offline for over 3 hours every month . Ideally , you want a high availability provider that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we offer this level for our shared hosting whilst offering 100% uptime for our business packages , VPS and dedicated servers , and cloud hosting . <p> Choosing a high availability host is essential if you want your website and business to have a reputation for reliability . It helps your customers trust you and guarantees that your site is always there to generate income and maintain the services you offer your customers . <h> 2 . Bandwidth limits <p> Bandwidth is a term used to describe the amount of data you send from your server to your visitors ' browsers . Every time someone loads one of your pages on their computer or smartphone you are using up bandwidth . If you have a site that has lots of heavy content , such as large media files ( videos , images , music , etc. ) you may use quite a lot of bandwidth . <p> Some web hosts or hosting packages set a limit to the amount of bandwidth you can use each month " this is known as bandwidth allocation . For websites that do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , if you find your traffic growing or if there is an unexpected spike in demand ( perhaps one of your posts gets a lot of shares on social media ) you may find that you go beyond your allocation . When this happens , there are two possibilities , you may find that your host prevents your website from displaying for the rest of the month or you may find yourself being charged for the extra bandwidth you have used " similar to what happens if you go beyond your data allocation with your mobile phone . <p> Neither paying for extra bandwidth or being taken offline are desirable options , especially as going beyond your bandwidth limit is a sign that your website is doing well . What you really need to look for is a web host that provides either unmetered or unlimited bandwidth on smaller ( shared ) hosting packages and bandwidth allocations on bigger ( dedicated server ) plans which are so high its highly unlikely you will ever surpass them . <h> 3 . Disk space allocation <p> The amount of disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are a small business wanting to run nothing more than a website , then you are not going to need huge disk space at all . However , if you are a large enterprise collecting enormous amounts of data and running powerful applications you will certainly need much more space for all the information and programs you need to store . <p> As most hosting packages have either disk space limits or file number limits , you should carefully assess your requirements and future needs before picking a package that will provide you with the disk space you require . At the same time , you need to make sure you do n't waste money buying space you will never use . If your website is only going to be a few hundred MB in size , there 's no point buying 20GB of disk space . <h> 4 . All day , every day , technical support <p> Managing a website can get quite technical and sometimes problems occur that either you do n't know how to solve or which need solving by your web host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides 24 hours a day , 365 days a year technical support . You do n't want your website going offline on Friday night and not being able to talk to someone until Monday morning . <p> Do note that the emphasis here is on technical support . There are some hosts that advertise 24/7 support but all you get is put you through to a call centre that handles general enquiries . Here at eUKhost , however , you will get complete technical support no matter when you get in touch or whether you communicate by phone , online chat or email . <h> 5 . Technical freedom <p> To enable your website to function in the way you want it to , there is a range of technical operations that you may want to carry out . Whilst , you may not have come across such things as FTP , PHP , . htaccess , MySQL , or cron jobs yet , it is likely that you will as you develop your knowledge of running a website . <p> FTP allows you to upload and download files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language that many websites are written in , but sometimes you need to use certain versions which are compatible with the software your website is built on . <p> . htaccess is a configuration file which can be edited to achieve many things including helping with site security . <p> MySQL is a form of database needed to run applications like WordPress <p> Cron jobs are tasks you set up to run certain processes automatically at prescribed times . <p> Some web hosts or some of the packages which web hosts provide do not give users the freedom to use all these services and therefore restrict what they can do with their websites . Ideally , you want to be able to use all of them and should look for a host that enables this . This is especially important for those looking for shared hosting as its these packages where most restrictions can be found . <h> 6 . Ability to use SSL <p> In simple terms , SSL is a small piece of software that enables websites to encrypt data sent from a user 's browser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have an address that begins with https instead of http . If you run a website that takes payments or personal information from customers , then it 's likely that you will require an SSL certificate " especially now that Google is warning customers that websites without https are not secure . <p> You will find that some web hosts ' servers are not configured to enable the use of SSL certificates and this should be checked before signing up . At eUKhost , we provide a range of SSL certificates to meet the security needs of a range of different businesses . <h> 7 . Great email <p> When you are purchasing a hosting package , you should also check out the email service that is provided with it . You need to make sure that you can set up email accounts that have the same domain as your website ( e.g. me@mywebsite.com ) and that you can use a range of access methods such as POP3 and IMAP . In addition , you want a service that can be accessed anywhere online and which allows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You should also look to see how well the service providers protect your email . Do they filter spam , monitor for viruses and malware , and check to see if your email address has been blacklisted ? If not , you may want to choose another provider . <h> 8 . Do you get a control panel ? <p> A control panel is the place where you manage your website and server . It allows you to make changes to your site , add new features and install new software and updates . It 's also the place where you can upgrade your account and add new hosting services if needed . <p> Some hosts provide a control panel which only gives you a few options and restricts what you can do , forcing you to go through customer services to do things like add new email accounts or change your password . <p> Ideally , you are looking for control panels such as cPanel or Plesk which are user-friendly , offer lots of options and which can be learned intuitively . <h> 9 . Security is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your choice of web host can make a big difference to how well your site is protected . You need a web host that can offer strong firewalls , intrusion protection , and monitoring to defend against malware . In addition , your host should provide a backup service so if your site is taken offline , you can restore it easily and in no time at all . <p> In this day and age , if a web host does n't provide robust security you should stay clear . <h> 10 . Choosing the right operating system <p> In general , most web hosts offer either a Linux or Windows operating system for their websites . The confusion for most new users is that whilst Windows is the predominant OS for home computers , Linux is the main choice for running websites . For many , there is n't a choice as the software you use to create your website will determine which system you have to go with . So , for example , if you are going to build a WordPress website , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first make sure that you know what software you will be using to build your website and then check that the appropriate operating system is available from that provider . <h> Conclusion <p> From reading this article , you should now have a much clearer picture of what you need to look for when choosing a web host . You should understand that there are quite a few technical considerations you need to think about as well as looking at the service and support offered by the host . <p> One of the things you should do is look at the reviews that the web host is receiving on social media and on platforms like TrustPilot . These will give you a clear indication of what the hosts current customers think of their service . <p> If you are looking for a web host that can offer all the things mentioned above and which constantly gets five-star reviews from its customers , take a look at the range of packages offered by eUKhost .

If someone is using your images on their website , blog or forum using the URL of the hosted image on your website , for each time that image is viewed , it is being served by the server in which your website is hosted on .

@@14549204 @3149204/ <h> The protection offered by hardware firewalls <h> The protection offered by hardware firewalls <p> A hardware firewall is a standalone appliance that is meant to sit in front of your IT infrastructure , or in other words between your servers and the Internet , acting as a guard so to say monitoring all traffic that is entering and leaving your network . Software firewalls are isolated to the server on which they are hosted and can only provide protection for a single device rather than an entire network , hence why a hardware firewall can be regarded as a sensible investment for an environment where you would like to apply the same firewall rules across a large expanse of hardware , to include devices that may not have their own software firewalls . Cisco is generally seen as being the best producer of robust and resilient hardware firewalls that are able to see off even the most intense of attacks . <p> Server stability <p> Using a software firewall can undermine the stability of the server . Although a software firewall will have the capabilities necessary to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , this does n't negate the threat as the traffic is still reaching the server and processing power is still being used in dealing with these attacks . This is where the first benefit of a hardware firewall emerges because it is able to stop rogue traffic before it even has a chance to reach your hardware , thereby preventing the attacks from impacting on server performance and stability . <p> Traffic filtering <p> Another benefit that arises from using a hardware firewall is its capability to analyse traffic as it passes through the device , using an anomaly detector to pick out any suspicious packets . Traffic that is flagged as being suspicious will then be stopped in its tracks and prevented from going any further , so that hackers trying to gain access to a server are stopped at the first hurdle . <p> Configure the firewall , but more importantly , test it <p> Whilst I 'm sure many hardware firewalls come with a great rule sets out of the box , when you are investing in such an expensive piece of equipment , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the most of what really is an investment . If you have had security breaches or have been the victim of DDoS attacks in the past then the first thing you should do is setup firewall rules to reflect this and to make sure that they can be prevented from happening again . It would also be worth consulting a security expert who can provide you with additional pointers on how best to use the appliance to protect your network . <p> Once you are happy with how you have the appliance configured , go ahead and test it . It 's all well and good having it configured how you like , but how are you sure that these rules are going to protect you if you do n't test them ? There are a number of different applications out there that you can use to test a firewall . Alternatively , if you are really confident in your security then why not hire a hacker to test it ? Testing applications are just going to be running a universal set of commands , but a hacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security in a tailored way that is relatable to common threats . <p> A hardware firewall is a great way of providing a network infrastructure .

@@14549205 @3149205/ <p> If you thought 2015 was a bad year for cyber security ( think Ashley Madison and Talk Talk ) , the outlook for 2016 looks considerably worse . According to global risk security company , Control Risk , next year will see a 37% increase in the severity of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems . <h> How will cyber-attacks develop in 2016 ? <p> What should concern us most about the predictions for 2016 is not just the increase in the number cyber-attacks but the increase in their severity . The report states that rather than just wanting to steal data , cyber criminals are increasingly focused on manipulating data and affecting the integrity of systems . They either want to infect sites with malware , corrupt the data stored on them or take them down completely . <p> One of the reasons why this is more likely and why we need to rethink our understanding of cyber criminals is that , whilst the number of financially motivated hackers continues to grow , the biggest increase , in 2015 , was in politically motivated , state-sponsored cyber-attacks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be 45 nation states carrying out covert operations ' in 2016 . <p> The targets here are government and infrastructure : oil , gas and utility companies as well as the telecommunications and finance sectors . 36% of attacks during 2015 were on government systems . In the USA , the US State Department system was infected with malware by Russian hackers and the Official Website of Indiana was taken down . In the UK , July saw Edinburgh Council lose 13,000 email addresses to hackers . <p> Aside from political hacking , financially motivated hacking will still continue to rise , with ransomware being increasingly used in 2016 . Hackers use ransomware to take control of their victims ' systems and prevent them getting access to their data until they have paid a ransom . The data is often encrypted and , on payment , an encryption key is given to the victim to get their system back . The risk for businesses is twofold here " either they can be held to ransom themselves or they can be exploited to help hackers attack their customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To protect against the increased threat of hacking we recommend you take the following steps : <h> 1 . Ensure you have the latest version of your software installed <p> All software which you run on your systems should be kept up-to-date . Updates do n't just give improvements in functionality ; they often come with security updates that protect against vulnerabilities . Using outdated software leaves the software open to attack . <h> 2 . Follow developers ' guidelines and sign up for updates <p> It is important that you follow the software developers ' best practice guidelines for keeping their application secure . It is also worthwhile registering for updates so that if a security vulnerability is found , you can follow any recommendations until an update is released . <h> 4 . Ensure that intrusion prevention systems are enabled <p> Intrusion prevention systems ( which are included in cPanel and Plesk ) can be configured to protect some of your applications " for example , fail2ban ( Plesk ) has predefined rulesets which can be enabled for WordPress. <h> 5 .

Make sure you regularly backup your data <p> You should always backup your website and database files so that if you are hacked , you can restore your website easily , quickly and inexpensively. <h> 8 . Enable an application firewall <p> A well-configured application firewall is a highly effective method of blocking cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks . They use a predefined ruleset to sanitise or block HTTP requests that do not conform to the rules .

Digital wallets are envisaged as a technology that will enable you to use one payment method whether you are shopping , whether this be online or in a shop ; whilst many online payment services require you to use a credit or debit card like you would in a shop , the online balances maintained by some services such as Paypal can only be used online " a digital wallet would work by allowing you to spend this balance anywhere you like . <p> Convenience <p> Digital wallets should make shopping online and in-store a much simpler and more enjoyable process because you will no longer have to carry around the vast amounts of bank card and loyalty cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and collect points at the same time . As an application that let 's you store the details of all the cards that you rely on and more , a digital wallet would allow you to choose the card that you would like to pay with on your mobile device and you would then proceed to tap that device on a reader and the card details would be communicated wirelessly using a short-range technology such as NFC ( Near Field Communication ) . Such technologies are becoming popular in the US because cards over there still rely on the magnetic strip , in the other hand here in the UK , digital wallet services could prove to be more complicated to implement since we are very reliant on chip and pin and contactless card technologies . <p> In either case , digital wallets could prove to be a very convenient solution , but widespread adoption is reliant on reducing market fragmentation and developing a standard around which all digital wallet services revolve . <p> Established authority versus Bitcoin <p> Although a digital currency , Bitcoin can be viewed as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of choosing a service that is offered by an established authority versus an unregulated and volatile digital currency . Bitcoin provides a way in which funds can be transferred securely electronically , but because it is a digital currency the value of it can go up and down by large amounts a lot of the time ; this has led to many retailer shying away from accepting it , though we have seen gradual adoption . Digital wallet services from Google and Paypal amongst others utilise the user 's local currency , therefore meaning that funds held here will be accepted anywhere the technology is available and the value of the currency held will be less susceptible to fluctuations . Established services provide more security than a digital currency such as Bitcoin because they rely on established authority , whereas with Bitcoin there is no single party responsible for the maintenance and security of the system . <p> Who needs to be working to advance digital wallet technology ? <p> In order for digital wallets to develop , we need to see a union between mobile device manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It should be noted that digital wallets are n't just a product of the companies creating the software , but require mobile device manufacturers to include particular hardware and the cooperation of banks . <p> In conclusion , I think that we 're all going to be stuck with our physical wallets and purses for the time being . With the technologies that digital wallets rely on being readily accessible in some countries and not available in others , there is no global standard around which the technology can be developed and so companies offering the services will need to take into account the defining characteristics of a market before entering it so that they are able to tailor the product to meet the needs of consumers . @qwx190774 @qwx190775 <h> UK residents will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think twice about ripping your CDs to your iTunes collection , indeed it is a feature that has been included from the start and provides users with an easy way of digitising their ... <h> RSS to increase your sites ranking <p> Everyday many dollars and hours are consumed on how to increase a website 's traffic .

In this article , we 'll explain how you can find out when the right time to publish is and how you can schedule your posts and social media updates to be published at those times . <h> Why is timing important ? <p> The internet is often referred to as the information highway and just like any traffic system there are periods when it 's busy and periods when it 's quiet . To get as many people to see your blog post as possible , you need to fire off your emails , tweets and Facebook updates when the most traffic is about . <p> Sending a tweet at 2 o'clock in the morning telling people about your new post will have no effect unless your article is about a cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they wake in the morning they 'll have received that many new tweets , yours will have disappeared into the ether never to be seen again . If this happens , no-one will know you have a new post to read . <p> You have to get the timing right . <h> But when is the best time to post ? <p> That , unfortunately , is the $64,000 question . And the answer depends upon a number of factors . These include : <p> The channels you use to communicate that you have published a new post ( Email , Facebook , Twitter , RSS , etc . ) <p> The geographical location of your primary audience ( because of time differences . ) <p> Socio-cultural routines of your particular target audience . Some audiences , for example , ca n't access social media during the working day . <p> To help , there is quite a lot of useful data available on the internet that can provide a clearer picture of when to post . Here , for example , is an infographic from the online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another way to find out the best time to post is to check your Google Analytics to see when your website gets the most hits . Below are two Google Analytics graphs , the top graph shows which hour of the day a website gets the most traffic and the bottom graph shows which day of the week it gets the most traffic . <p> The most popular hours are 20:00 and 21:00 . <p> The most popular day is Monday . <p> From the information in the two graphs above , you can quickly gather that the optimum time to publish a new post and to publicise it via email and social media would be between 8.00pm and 9.00pm on Monday evenings . <p> To make this data more accurate , you should filter out organic and direct visitors , so that you can see the hour and day when you get most referral traffic , i.e. , traffic from social media and email . <p> It 's also a good idea to dig even deeper into your data and look at the traffic from specific referral sources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak at different times on different days . If this is the case , you would schedule your tweets and Facebook updates to go out at different times so that each can have the most impact . <h> Trial and error <p> Whether you use your own website data or sources such as the Quicksprout infographic as a means to determine when to publish and publicise , you should keep a record of when you publicise so that you can analyse the impact . If the times you choose do not show an increase in visitors , then you may want to adjust the timings a little to see if it has the required effect . <h> Audiences like a scheduled post <p> Once you have established an optimum time to publish a new post , you should aim to keep this as your scheduled publishing time . Consistency and regularity can be very helpful if you have a growing number of visitors and email subscribers as they quickly become accustomed to seeing your new posts at a certain day and time . <p> Scheduled publishing gives an engaged audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a TV audience looks forward to seeing their favourite weekly show . This can be a great way to generate even more views as your regular visitors always know when to come back . <h> No more missing posts <p> If you have already got into the habit of posting at a regular time slot , it can be frustrating if things like a holiday get in the way . Using the inbuilt WordPress scheduler prevents this from happening as you can write your posts before you go and schedule them for publication whilst you are away . Once scheduled , WordPress will publish automatically . <h> How to schedule <p> Now you know the benefits of scheduling , we 'll explain the simple process you need to undertake to schedule the publication of your WordPress posts . Here are the steps : <p> Finish writing your post and save as a draft . <p> As you normally would , find the publish box in the right-hand <p> Instead of clicking on the blue Publish ' button , find the line above which says Publish immediately ' and click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you click on Edit the options appear for scheduling the date and time of publication . <p> Change the date and time to the date and time you want the publication to occur and then click on the OK ' button . ( Do not click the Publish ' button . ) <p> Once you have clicked OK , the box will change to this : <p> If you are happy with the time and date you have scheduled the publication , click on the Schedule ' button . You post is now scheduled . <h> Scheduling posts to Facebook and Twitter <p> There are plugins available for WordPress which allow you to automate publishing your posts to Twitter , Facebook and a range of other social media , examples include the Publicize ' feature on Jetpack and the Social Networks Auto Poster ( SNAP ) plugin . Whilst these will auto-publish , they only do so at the time you schedule your post to be published .

This indicates that even the network and the servers of big players are n't  100% secure nor stable . <p> At certain occasions , there is hardly anything that can be done for avoiding the outages that are caused due to natural environmental reasons , nor can anything much be done to avoid security breach due to large DDoS attacks . The only controllable factor is to take precautionary measures to tackle such instances . The information given below would help oneself with preparing you with unplanned server outages which ultimately causes downtime for your websites . <p> Server Back-ups " Most web hosting UK providers would strongly recommend users to maintain an updated copy of backups of the server and the content within . Few outages may be such that the data can be impossible to recover due to hardware failure .

Still having an updated backup of your own can help you avoid any loss of data . <p> Redundancy " With the ever growing requirement of power , there may be instances when it could potentially go down . While incase the issue is with a single hardware instead of wide spectrum of intrusion , it can be instantly replaced with an identical hardware holding the same data . <p> Having a Mitigation strategyin place " One must avoid being over-confident by thinking that your server can not be compromised .

Following are some pointers about the benefits of backups . <p> You must realise that having a backup of your server should be a very crucial and routine task for you . You must not just rely on automated backups but do a manual check ensuring that the backups taken are appropriate and can be used if required . If , you are still taking the back-ups thing lightly , then below are few reasons for maintaining an updated copy of backups at any point of time . <p> If you are running an online business that offers services to customers , for example you offer affordable web hosting services to customers , wherein individuals and businesses depend on you for maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost responsibility of delivering a high standard of data and information security .

These backup servers are located at distant locations hence ensuring that the data is secured and safe . You may opt for such an add-on service , even if you are required to pay for them , yet in the event of data loss , you will be able to keep your business safe . It does n't  matter , what type of hosting package you have it may be a Linux based server or Windows or even a free BSD one installed over a dedicated , cloud hosting , virtual private server or even a shared server , you can opt for a backup solution . <p> Most web masters and server administrators would agree to the fact that nothing can be predicted when working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take precautions against the possible threats that encircle the Industry . <p> Moreover , having a backup can simplify the task of migrating to a new hardware .

If you have 2 GB Ram then set this value to 300 There is no reason for you to set it any higher unless you have a specific problem with this value . A high value can lead to a complete server hang in case of a DOS attack . A value too low can create timeout problems for your clients if the limit is reached . <p> ServerLimit This value should be same as MaxClients ServerLimit = 150 x RAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control how many spare ( unused ) child-processes Apache will keep alive while waiting for more requests to put them to use . Each child-process consumes resources , so having MaxSpareServers set too high can cause resource problems . On the other hand , if the number of unused servers drops below MinSpareServers , Apache will fork ( an expensive operation ) new child-processes until MinSpareServers is satisfied . <p> Keep those to <p> MinSpareServers 5 MaxSpareServers 10 <p> If you have more them 2 GB of RAM and you run a resource intensive website consider increasing MaxSpareServers . <p> MaxRequestsPerChild It controls the number of request the a child serves before the child is killed . This should not be set too low as it will put an unnecessary load on the apache server to recreate the child . MaxRequestsPerChild 1000 for 1 GB RAM <p> KeepAlive and MaxKeepAliveRequests KeepAlive provides long-lived HTTP sessions which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection .

Sets the number of child server processes created on startup . This setting depends greatly on the type of webserver you run . If you run low traffic websites on that server set it low to something like 5 . If you have resource intensive websites on that server you should set it close to MaxClients . <p> StartServers 5 <p> Timeout The amount of time Apache will wait for three things : The total amount of time it takes to receive a GET request , The amount of time between receipt of TCP packets on a POST or PUT request , the amount of time between ACKs on transmissions of TCP packets in responses . <p> The default value is 300 .

Once the payment has been received , the money is transferred to your business current account " the merchant account itself does not accrue a balance . <p> You can set up a merchant account with your own business bank or through a third party payment processor " there are many third party processors available . <p> Merchant accounts are not free . Some charge monthly fees and most of them will take a small percentage of each transaction that you make . Rates vary and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for you " though it can be difficult to compare . Those that charge a monthly fee often have lower transaction rates and some of those that have no monthly fee will charge a small fixed fee plus a percentage for each transaction . <h> Payment processor <p> A payment processor is a financial services company that processes the payments taken on your website . They take the information sent by your customer and will deal with the credit card company to authorise the payment so that it goes into your merchant account . They will also do this in reverse to help you make refunds . <p> Payment for your payment processing service will usually come under the cost of your merchant account fees or vice versa . <h> Payment gateways <p> The payment gateway is the secure checkout on your website . It is a piece of software , built into your website , that is able to calculate the cost of the items in your customer 's shopping basket , add tax and shipping costs and deduct discounts for vouchers , etc . It will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most importantly , it will encrypt these so that the personal data remains secure during the transfer from your website to the payment processor . <p> Most payment processors will provide you with the payment gateway software that you need to install on your website . The majority of e-commerce website themes , templates and plugins enable payment gateways to be easily integrated into your online store . Read more on payment gateways , here . <h> PayPal <p> PayPal is a very popular way for people to pay online . There are two main ways you can use PayPal ; PayPal Gateway or PayPal Standard . PayPal Gateway is just like any other gateway and works by installing a secure checkout on your website . PayPal Standard works in a slightly different way . Instead of buying directly from your website , your customers are redirected to PayPal . Here they log into their own PayPal account and will authorise payment to you from there before being redirected back to your site . PayPal will then send confirmation emails to your customer for you , informing them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useful addition to your business if you have opted for an alternative payment processor but still want customers to be able to use PayPal if they wish . Unlike merchant accounts , the money deposited into your PayPal Standard account is not automatically transferred to your business current account . You will need to do this manually or set up a transfer . <h> Getting the trust of online shoppers <p> If you sell online , it is important that potential customers see your site as trustworthy . As people get wiser to internet security , no-one is going to type their credit card details into a website that does n't appear genuine . <p> One important way to do this is to have an SSL certificate . SSL is a way of encrypting personal data that customers input into your website so that it can not be stolen . A website with an SSL certificate can boost confidence in customers . A website without one can be flagged as unsafe by security software that customers have installed on their computers and mobile devices . <p> Websites with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padlock next to their web address on a browser . They also have a web address that begins with https ' instead of http ' . You can purchase an SSL certificate from your web host . <h> Conclusion <p> Online consumers want their online shopping experience to be quick , convenient and safe . They want to pay instantly and their products delivered today or tomorrow . Accepting online payments by credit card , debit card or PayPal gives them the speed , convenience and security they desire . And by speeding up payment , it gives you the chance to ship your products quickly to your customers . <p> If you are considering setting up an online business and are looking for a web host , why not take a look at our own easy to use- Amazing Website builder ? @qwx190776 <h> 8 Security Tips to Protect Your Website from Hackers <p> Even if you are running , a small website that you think will be of little interest to hackers , there is never any reason why you should n't be taking the security of it seriously .

All you need to do now is sit back and wait for your customers to put in orders . If only it was so easy. - Before that 's going to happen you have to get traffic to your website and then you need to convert those visitors into customers . In our last post , we discussed using advertising and affiliate marketing as a means to drive traffic , in this article , we 'll discuss ten other very effective techniques that businesses use to increase their visitor numbers . <h> 1 . Exploit your own expertise <p> One of the most powerful ways to attract visitors to your business website is by creating a blog that helps people to solve problems relating to your field of expertise . For example , if you sell beauty products , a blog that gives hints and tips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular readers and to promote the products you sell . <p> By using a range of media in your blog " writing , images , infographics and video , you can improve audience engagement and get your visitors to sign up for that ever important email list . Good content marketing also works well in conjunction with social media . <h> 2 . Harness the power of social media <p> One of the best methods you can use to promote your business is social media . Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are great ways for you to interact with potential customers , showcase your products and define your brand . In return you get people following you , liking you and sharing your content with others . In essence , it 's free advertising . <p> However , do n't restrict yourself to just Facebook and Twitter . Other platforms offer some exciting opportunities too . If you have visually appealing products or services then Instagram and Pinterest are ideal channels . Pinterest is also perfect for any business that belongs in the design , creative or crafts fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business appear in personalised search results . There are many more social media platforms besides these . <h> 3 . Use attention grabbing headlines and meta descriptions <p> When your business turns up in search results , two things are shown to the person making the search : your page or post 's title and the meta description . These are the only things the searcher has to help them make a decision on which result to click . <p> To improve your chances of being clicked on and getting more people to your website , you need to write attention grabbing headlines and back this up with a meta description that will be irresistible . <h> 4 . Optimise your content for search engines <p> SEO is a way to help your content rank higher in search engine results . Although there are lots of experts out there who will provide you with highly detailed consultancy , there are some basic things that everyone can do to improve their SEO . <p> Put your keywords in the title , meta description and the first paragraph of the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the content . <p> Make sure your subheadings are created with h2 tags " i.e. they are seen as subheadings by search engines , not just bold text . <p> Include internal links in your content to other important pages and posts on your website . <p> Make sure all images use alt tags ' " this helps search engines understand what all the content on your page is about , not just the text . <p> Use external links to high authority . edu and . gov websites when appropriate . For example , if you were selling garden buildings you could link to a . gov page about planning permission . <h> 5 . Make sure you have a responsive website <p> A responsive website is one which changes the way it looks to fit the device it is being viewed on . You can tell the ones which are n't because when you look at them on mobile phones , the text will be so small you will need to zoom in to read it and you will need to keep scrolling from side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on smaller devices and cause visitors using phones and tablets to leave and go elsewhere . If 40% of your visitors are using these devices , you could be losing a substantial amount of business by not having a responsive website . In addition , as Google now down ranks non-responsive websites , you could see your traffic massively reduced . <h> 6 . Get active in conversations <p> Just as networking in the real world can attract business , networking on the internet can increase traffic . By joining related forums and commenting on other websites you will soon find yourself attracting the attention of others . If you are able to link back to your website on these forums and websites , then you are leaving the door open to get increased numbers of referrals from these sites . Make sure you choose only high authority sites to do this . <h> 7 . Grow your authority <p> One of the best ways to generate large numbers of visitors is to have other high authority websites link to your content . If you find that your content gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , someone who has 100,000 visitors a day to their site and several million twitter followers , then your website can go viral . <p> If quite a few influencers and other leading websites link to you , Google and other search engines will begin to take notice that you are seen as an authority in your niche and , as a result , your search engine rankings will increase also . <p> To do this , you need to write exceptional content ; articles which offer expert advice and are highly regarded by your peers . <h> 8 . Engage with the influencers <p> One of the ways to get noticed by your peers and the main influences in your niche is to engage with them . If you are selling beauty products , send samples to the leading beauty bloggers ; if they like what they get , they may tell their readers about you . <p> You can also engage them by writing a post about them , for example , The 10 Best Beauty Blogs You Just Have to Read . Flattery can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who can boost your fortunes just by sending out a quick Tweet can be a credible way to improve traffic to your site . <h> 9 . Write guest blog posts <p> Getting the opportunity to write a problem solving guest post and have it posted on a high traffic niche blog can be another way to boost your traffic . If readers are interested in the advice you give , they are likely to visit your website after reading the blog post . If , for example , you sold timber online , you could write a post about which wood is the best to use for different projects and send this to a woodworking blog . Readers of that blog would then be inspired to visit your own website . <p> Many influential blogs let people write guest posts . For some , you need to email and ask if you can submit an article ; others advertise the fact by having a Guest Post Submissions page which will tell you what you need to do to get an article published . <h> 10 . Find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in some market sectors than others . One of the best ways to find out which works in your sector is to see what your competition is doing to attract traffic . How do they use social media ? Do they guest post ? <p> You can visit their website , read their blogs and follow them on Facebook and Twitter . You should also visit BuzzSumo , a website which analyses social media and the internet and can inform you which content works best for any topic and any competitor ; it 's well worth looking at . <h> Conclusion <p> This article will hopefully have shown you that PPC advertising is not the only way to attract visitors to your online business . By using social media , SEO and engaging with influencers within your niche you can improve your website 's ranking and authority and get others to promote your business for you .

These end-points maybe anything from web browsers , mobile devices or gaming consoles . The information delivered to you below would help you understand about CDNs and how itd be used for your businesses . <p> A CDN can be categorised into : ( a ) CDNs that cater general content but is n't restricted to video only ; ( b ) CDNs delivering on-demand video and ( c ) CDNs delivering Live Video or what we usually call it as Live Streaming . <p> Some of these technologies have gained greater popularity than others . Some work on the methods of complete/progressive download /streaming or HTTP delivery . <p> Let 's take a closer look at the features of these technologies . <p> General Purpose CDNs <p> It might have so happened that unknowingly youd have used services based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the iTunes Store . <p> The general purpose Content Delivery Networks carries out a function known as web acceleration . To use such a CDN technology you are essentially required to have multiple servers located at different geo-locations . To increase it efficiency , one must ensure that the servers are hosted in a close vicinity of large connection points between Internet service providers ( ISPs ) or even within the same data centers as a popular website or gaming/application provider . The Content Delivery Network caches content , and serves to the user requests from the stored copy of content . <p> This technology of web acceleration has evolved from the past to a state of a complex form due to the very fact that the internet connectivity offered by ISPs have much restrictions and fail to cover larger areas . In order to achieve an efficient CDN delivery with web acceleration , it is necessary that the content is cached at multiple locations , resulting in the necessity of a nation-wide branching of multiple servers hosted at maximum number of data-centers and ISP headends / POPs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general purpose CND services also deliver an on-demand video content . Such content usually consists of large files such as a game , large downloadable application hence pointing to a fact that is n't too different than other content . <p> Until recently it was essential for a video delivery to be served from special high config streaming servers . These servers could deliver the content at the time of a request , but had a drawback , itd just deliver the bits requested instead of the complete video file . This usually happened due to the hesitance of CDN services to invert in costly steaming servers and the software required to run the network . Therefore the service was n't necessarily serving well to the expectations . This led to a choice of direct downloads , wherein full video clip had to be downloaded to a local computer of the requester inorder for it to be viewed . This is exactly what was required for downloading large files , but in this patience used to be tested and the requester couldnt wait that long until the process could complete . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download , which is something we see at YouTube . In this type of delivery system , the CDNs could deliver the download , and the requester could view it within few seconds ( ofcourse the Internet speed played an important role ) and download process would continue in the background . In this the waiting time could be greatly reduced and the content could be downloaded much faster and before the viewer could reach half way to viewing the video . <p> It was later observed that , if the requester abandoned viewing the video mid-way , the owner of the content was still changed for the entire download . Such a problem was managed by a streaming server wherein itd enhance content delivery ( curtail the speed at which content was downloaded to a level just a bit faster than content would be viewed ) while still avoiding the use of a specialized streaming server for on-demand content . <p> It is just recently that the Industry got to use an even advanced technology of HTTP streaming that had a rigid adaptive bitrate ( ABR ) encoding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming technology makes use of generic HTTP servers ( usually an Apache or Windows Server ) to service the on-demand video files similar to ways the requests of website content is served .

It created discrete streams at various bitrates and then uses feedback from the Internet users video player to dynamically detect the optimum network speed for delivery of the video clip . <p> Based on the network conditions , the stream that had the best appropriate bitrate is served for a particular data fragment and time .

@@14549261 @3149261/ <h> Essential User Experience Requirements for Today 's Websites <h> Essential User Experience Requirements for Today 's Websites <p> The number one priority for many website owners is to improve the user experience or UX ' as it 's commonly referred to . With so many websites vying for consumers ' attention , only those which satisfy their increasingly high demands are going to prosper . Sites that offer a great UX have increased user engagement , higher volumes of returning visitors , more social shares and organic backlinks , and better conversion rates . In this article , we 'll look at the factors that help create a great user experience so you can take steps to implement them on your website. <h> 1 . A website made for its audiences <p> We 've deliberately used the word audiences rather than audience because one of the best things you can do to give customers a great user experience is to create a website catering for different audience niches . <p> Creating a website aimed at vague profiles such as men between 18 and 35 ' wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . What appeals to one , wo n't necessarily appeal to another . To get it right you need to consider different subgroups within that profile and find out the interests , goals and the problems each one wants you to solve for them . <p> A website that tries to meets the needs of the wider range of customers may fail to engage anyone . - A better way to go about this would be to give different types of customer website content especially for them . This can be done by segmenting your existing website into separate areas or by creating separate websites . <p> One website which is spectacularly good creating separate content areas aimed at specific audiences is the BBC . Take a look at BBC News , BBC Newsround and - BBC Cymru . All three sections of the website carry the main news but each is tailored for the intended audience " this includes page design , content and language . <h> 2 . Easy Navigation <p> One of the key areas in giving exceptional UX is navigation . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what they are looking for . There are several factors which you need to take into account when making an easily navigable website . <p> Menus <p> Menus should be easy to see , well organised and clearly labelled . If needed , you should use submenus too . If you use things like mega menus you need to ensure that they work smoothly on all devices whether using a mouse or a touch screen . <p> One thing that web developers often fail to overlook when creating a menu is a website 's analytics . If , for example , your website 's blog gets 60% of the traffic , then it might be a wiser decision to include a link to your blog in your main menu rather than having it buried somewhere in the footer . <p> Site Search <p> Easy to install and use , site search plugins can give users quick access to content which is n't so easily accessible from the home page or which is not glaringly obvious on the menus . It 's a great way to stop people hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out within a few seconds of landing . <p> Getting the terms right <p> Another key factor for menus , page titles and content is to look the keywords that people use to find your site . For example , if you had a section of your website called Family Holidays ' but found most of the visitors were searching for family vacations ' , it would be a wise move to change the content so that the terms they were looking for matched those used on the site . <p> In-content navigation <p> Visitors come looking for specific information . If they can not find it quickly , they 'll leave and look elsewhere . Even if your menu system works fine and sends them to the right page , they 'll still want to find the information on that page quickly . The best way to achieve this is to use subheadings that accurately sum up the content of the section they head . This way , it 's just a matter of scrolling down . <p> If you have very long pages with highly detailed content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and add a page contents menu that takes readers to the part of the page they are looking for . Many websites do this and perhaps the one we are most familiar with is Wikipedia. <h> 3 . Warp Factor 10 , Mr Scott <p> Today 's internet users expect instant loading . They want their web pages now and if you have streaming content of any kind it had better not show the buffering sign . You know this , because what frustrates them , frustrates you too . <p> It does n't matter whether they are using a 2G network on an old phone at the top of Ben Nevis or they 're hardwired into Richard Branson 's personal router : if there 's an internet connection , your website had better work quickly or they 'll take their business somewhere else . <p> There are numerous ways you can improve your site speed but the starting point is to test your loading times on Google 's PageSpeed Insights and see what its recommendations are for improvement . It will show you what you need to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To improve your speed , you may have to use a content delivery network , optimise the images on your site , minify your JavaScript or compress some of your scripting files . <p> One of the biggest factors that can affect the speed and performance of your website is your hosting package . Factors such as whether you use shared , VPS or dedicated hosting can have an effect on loading times , as can the servers which on your service provider hosts your site. - Ideally , you need servers which have the latest chips and SSD memory and which are configured for speed . VPS servers are ideal for smaller companies wanting exceptional loading times , whilst dedicated servers offer the fastest solution for larger enterprises . <h> 4 . Content with value <p> The most important thing you can do to give visitors the best user experience is to create content that they find of value .

Not Eligible for an ac.uk domain name LONG ... <p> An eligible organisation may take out as many names within the ac.uk domain as it wishes , subject to the following rules which apply to each requested domain name . <p> 1 . A request will NOT be allowed if it is for a name that is either one or two characters in length . <p> 2 . Three Letter Acronyms ( TLAs ) will not be accepted unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the organisation it is deemed to represent is well-known throughout the UK academic and Research Community .

These names are regarded as exceptional , and should not be regarded as setting a Precedent . <p> Important Information ================= If a name is allocated as a result of misrepresentation on the part of the requester or its principal , JANET(UK) reserves the right to withdraw the allocated name . In such a circumstance the domain name owners will be contacted and given 2 weeks notice in order to appeal against the decision . There will be no compensation for costs ( direct or indirect ) incurred by the organisation as a result of the need to rename . The Committee expect that the use of an approved name will lead directly to the homepage ( or " under construction " trailer ) for that organisation and not to that of its ISP or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name being withdrawn . <p> Organisations should NOT print a domain name on any stationery or publications until they have received formal notification that the name has been approved .

This will mean that there is no objection to the name from the Naming Committee and a positive acknowledgement will be returned to the ISP submitting the request ; <p> REJECTED . This will mean that the domain name is not acceptable to the Naming Committee . The reason for this would include one or more of the following : <p> Usually there will be no charge for a request that produces a REJECTED outcome . However , JANET(UK) reserves the right to make a suitable charge for frivolous , time-wasting or other requests which impose an undue use of resources to deal with . Once payment has been made , in the case of JANET Customers , or the account of the Approved ISP has been charged , ACCEPTED domain names will be put forward for delegation in the DNS . In the case of a REJECTED outcome any subsequent domain name requests for the same end user will be treated as a new request .
