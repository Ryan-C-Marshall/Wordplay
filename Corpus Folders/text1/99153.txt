@@34750684 @3750684/ <p> If you are experiencing slower speeds than your expected speed range , there may be other things impacting your speed , listed above . <p> What does FTTN/FFTB mean and why might the speed of nbnG broadband change ? <p> Fibre to the Node ( FTTN ) and Fibre to the Basement ( FTTB ) are a way of providing fast broadband by running a fibre-optic cable to a neighbourhood node cabinet . From there , nbnG uses the existing copper network to connect to homes and business premises . <p> Speeds are impacted where the fibre-optic cable changes to the copper wires . Just as data rates of ADSL and ADSL2+ broadband reduce with increased distance from an exchange , so do the data rates as the distance of the copper between the node cabinet and your home or business premises increases . <p> The graph details how the distance of the copper cable from your nbnG connection box to the nbnG node impacts the speed .

Ensure that it is also as centrally located as possible so you still get a good signal . Be mindful that the further away you are from the modem , the less signal you are likely to receive . <p> Change your wireless channelYour modem transmits a signal on a particular channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because most of your neighbours will also have Wi-Fi and if everyone is on the same channel , it is like having 100 people in a room all trying to have separate conversations . With trial and error , you may find an alternate channel that works best for you ( suggested channels are 1 , 6 or 11 ) . See ADSL modem settings- for instructions . <p> If you are an Apple iOS user- and have the Belong Sagem modem ( pictured below ) and still experience slow speed on Wi-Fi after trying the above troubleshooting tips , you could try enabing a modem setting called WMM Advertise ' ( Wireless Multimedia ) by following the below steps : - <p> Ensure your Belong modem is plugged in and you are connected to it <p> Open a new internet browser and enter into the URL bar your Default Gateway access : - http : //belong.gateway- or- http : //10.0.0.138- ( these details can be found at- the back of your Belong- modem ) <p> Enter the Username : admin ' and Password : Belong ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the Device Info ' page , if your Software Version ( Line 7 from the top ) is less than 9.35 , click Wireless ' - on the left menu .

If the main devices you use are non-Apple , we recommend you do not tick the Disable WMM Advertise ' box . If your Belong modem is Software Version 9.35 or greater , this box should be left unticked. 204289 @qwx404289

The key difference between these two services is speed. - Belong uses Telstra 's network , if you have an ADSL2+ service provides maximum download speeds of up to 20Mbps , and maximum upload speeds of up to 850 Kbps . If you are unable to get ADSL2+ you will be offered an ADSL service where available . An ADSL service provides maximum download speeds of up to 8Mbps , and maximum upload speeds of up to 384 Kbps. - Actual speeds will be lower , and will vary based on a number of factors including distance to the exchange , internet traffic in your neighbourhood , how you use your service , the quality of your telephone line , and the manner in which you are connecting to your Belong modem . <p> The below graph provides theoretical maximum download speeds based on distance from the exchange .

If it is identified that your order requires a Proof of Occupancy we will contact you . Why do I need to show Proof of Occupancy ?

In order for Belong to take ownership of the line and allow your connection to proceed , Belong must sight a Proof of Occupancy document to confirm your residence . This authorises Belong to disconnect the existing line on your behalf . What Proof of Occupancy documents can I provide ? A Proof of Occupancy document can include any one of these : Lease Rental Agreement Contract of Sale Letter of confirmation from a nursing home ( on appropriate letter head ) Statutory declaration* from the new occupant and a utility bill ( e.g. rates , power , water ) Statutory declaration* from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant Statutory declaration* from the property owner and the bond payment receipt Letter from the real estate agent and the rent receipt from the new occupant Letter from the real estate agent and the bond payment receipt .
