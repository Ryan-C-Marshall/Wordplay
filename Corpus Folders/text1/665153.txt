Our Learn to Cook Series is a helpful precursor , but not a requirement to take this course . The chef will give a lecture , usually with a demonstration , and then the students will prepare the dishes , working in teams of 2 , with a limit of 12 students to a class . The chef will provide guidance as you work , teaching you tricks of the trade as you progress . Students will present the dishes at the end of class and taste them , along with the chef instructor educating your palate and providing guidance and inspiration . We want you to gain knowledge of not just how to perform all basic cooking TECHniques but also the kitchen science behind our methods . Culinary confusion will be transformed into kitchen confidence , and you will leave knowing how to make your ingredients yield maximum flavor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech does not offer financial aid but will finance the program cost over the course of your series .

For example , if your class is scheduled for the evening of January 10th you would need to cancel with us by 11:59 pm on January 5th . Wan na know the reason behind the 5 day cancellation policy ?

It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength , prosperity , and well-being of our country . <p> Founder of Labor Day <p> More than 100 years after the first Labor Day observance , there is still some doubt as to who first proposed the holiday for workers.Some records show that Peter J. McGuire , general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a cofounder of the American Federation of Labor , was first in suggesting a day to honor those " who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold . " But Peter McGuire 's place in Labor Day history has not gone unchallenged . Many believe that Matthew Maguire , a machinist , not Peter McGuire , founded the holiday . Recent research seems to support the contention that Matthew Maguire , later the secretary of Local 344 of the International Association of Machinists in Paterson , N.J. , proposed the holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Labor Union adopted a Labor Day proposal and appointed a committee to plan a demonstration and picnic . <p> The First Labor Day <p> The first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday , September 5 , 1882 , in New York City , in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union . The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day holiday just a year later , on September 5 , 1883 . In 1884 the first Monday in September was selected as the holiday , as originally proposed , and the Central Labor Union urged similar organizations in other cities to follow the example of New York and celebrate a " workingmen 's holiday " on that date . The idea spread with the growth of labor organizations , and in 1885 Labor Day was celebrated in many industrial centers of the country . <p> Labor Day Legislation <p> Through the years the nation gave increasing emphasis to Labor Day . The first governmental recognition came through municipal ordinances passed during 1885 and 1886 . From them developed the movement to secure state legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York legislature , but the first to become law was passed by Oregon on February 21 , 1887 . During the year four more states Colorado , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and New York created the Labor Day holiday by legislative enactment . By the end of the decade Connecticut , Nebraska , and Pennsylvania had followed suit . By 1894 , 23 other states had adopted the holiday in honor of workers , and on June 28 of that year , Congress passed an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories . <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 10 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305 212322 @qwx1072322 212330 @qwx1072330 212328 @qwx1072328 <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 17 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305 212322 @qwx1072322 212330 @qwx1072330 212328 @qwx1072328 <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 24 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305

It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength , prosperity , and well-being of our country . <p> Founder of Labor Day <p> More than 100 years after the first Labor Day observance , there is still some doubt as to who first proposed the holiday for workers.Some records show that Peter J. McGuire , general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a cofounder of the American Federation of Labor , was first in suggesting a day to honor those " who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold . " But Peter McGuire 's place in Labor Day history has not gone unchallenged . Many believe that Matthew Maguire , a machinist , not Peter McGuire , founded the holiday . Recent research seems to support the contention that Matthew Maguire , later the secretary of Local 344 of the International Association of Machinists in Paterson , N.J. , proposed the holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Labor Union adopted a Labor Day proposal and appointed a committee to plan a demonstration and picnic . <p> The First Labor Day <p> The first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday , September 5 , 1882 , in New York City , in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union . The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day holiday just a year later , on September 5 , 1883 . In 1884 the first Monday in September was selected as the holiday , as originally proposed , and the Central Labor Union urged similar organizations in other cities to follow the example of New York and celebrate a " workingmen 's holiday " on that date . The idea spread with the growth of labor organizations , and in 1885 Labor Day was celebrated in many industrial centers of the country . <p> Labor Day Legislation <p> Through the years the nation gave increasing emphasis to Labor Day . The first governmental recognition came through municipal ordinances passed during 1885 and 1886 . From them developed the movement to secure state legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York legislature , but the first to become law was passed by Oregon on February 21 , 1887 . During the year four more states Colorado , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and New York created the Labor Day holiday by legislative enactment . By the end of the decade Connecticut , Nebraska , and Pennsylvania had followed suit . By 1894 , 23 other states had adopted the holiday in honor of workers , and on June 28 of that year , Congress passed an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories . <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 10 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305 212322 @qwx1072322 212330 @qwx1072330 212328 @qwx1072328 <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 17 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305 212322 @qwx1072322 212330 @qwx1072330 212328 @qwx1072328 <p> Event/Date 212303 @qwx1072303 212295 @qwx1072295 <p> Sun , Sep 24 2017 212333 @qwx1072333 212331 @qwx1072331 212305 @qwx1072305
