In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran , he has gravitated toward an earnest , matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium .

The album sold moderately well , fueled by the singles " SlaughtaHouse " , " Saturday Nite Live " , " Style Wars " and " Jeep Ass Niguh " . " Jeep " featured an unlisted remix titled " Born to Roll " , which became a smash crossover single in 1994 , peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . Also in ' 94 , Ace became a member of a temporary crew called the Crooklyn Dodgers , along with rap vet Special Ed and Black Moon 's Buckshot , and recorded the title track for the soundtrack to Spike Lee 's film Crooklyn .

Sittin ' On Chrome included " Born to Roll " , as well as two other Hot 100 hit singles , " The I.N.C. Ride " and " Sittin ' on Chrome " . In 1996 , Ace split up with the I.N.C. crew and was largely missing from the hip hop scene over the next five years , save for a number of random vinyl singles . During his vinyl days , he bounced from a number of labels , releasing his " Cars " single on Tape Kingz Records , his " Yeah Yeah Yeah " and " NFL " singles on the Union Label , his " NY Confidential " single on Replay Records , his " Express Delivery " single on Three Sixty Records , his " Spread It Out/Hellbound " single on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Records , his " Ghetto Like " single on Fat Beats , his " So Now U A MC " single on Bad Magic Records , and his " Brooklyn Blocks " single on Buckshot 's Duck Down Records . 2001-present Ace 's " Ghetto Like " single led to a misunderstanding with an underground emcee named Boogieman , who released a somewhat similar single titled " Ghetto Life " not long before . He thought that Ace was " biting " his track and released a dis song toward Ace titled " Just You Wait " . The dis led to a rap battle between the two at a Lyricist Lounge event , a battle that was won by Boogieman . Ace later claimed that he delivered his rhymes off the top of his head , while Boog was rapping previously written lyrics , a topic which he discusses on his scathing retaliation track " Acknowledge " , aimed at Boogieman and the underground rap group the High &amp; Mighty .

Disposable Arts became one of the most acclaimed underground hip-hop releases of 2001 , beloved for its pure hip hop style and clever album concept , which served as a fictional story , chronicling Ace 's time spent at a satirical rap school named the Institute of Disposable Arts . JCOR Records folded soon after the release , leaving it out-of-print , until being re-released in 2005 on Ace 's self-established M3 label . The album closer , " No Regrets " , led many fans to believe that it would be Ace 's final album , because of the line " I do n't know if it 's the end , but yo , it might be " . Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album A Long Hot Summer , another highly acclaimed effort .

He commonly acknowledges his fan base outside of the United States , which is considerably larger than within , as in the final seconds of his song " Good Ol ' Love " . He has shown an openness to working with foreign-based producers , including Koolade of Croatia and DJ Serious of Canada . He also performed a guest rap for the British Acid jazz group Young Disciples for their debut album .

The track spawned a follow-up in 1995 , with a third projected for 2006 , but neither Ace nor the other original contributors , Special Ed and the bellicose Buckshot ( of Black Moon and Boot Camp Clik ) , were involved with them . Instead , the second Crooklyn Dodgers track was produced by DJ Premier and involved O.C. , Chubb Rock and Jeru the Damaja , where the planned third installment is said to involve Mos Def , Jean Grae , and Memphis Bleek , with production courtesy of 9th Wonder .

@@37666665 @6666665/ <p> James Brown ( b . James Joseph Brown , 3 May 1933 , in Barnwell , SC , USA " d. 25 Dec 2006 ) , is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century music . He was a seminal force in the evolution of gospel and rhythm and blues into soul and funk . He has also left his mark on numerous other musical genres , including rock , jazz , reggae , disco , dance and electronic music , and hip-hop music . Joining Bobby Byrd 's vocal group The Famous Flames , in 1955 , Brown 's early mid-50s recordings were fairly straightforward gospel-inspired R&amp;B compositions , heavily influenced by contemporaries , including : Ray Charles and Little Richard , who was particularly significant in Brown 's development as a musician and showman . Brown followed his successful Live at the Apollo ( 1963 ) , with a string of singles that - along with the work of Allen Toussaint , in New Orleans - essentially defined the foundation of funk music . During the mid-1960s , two of Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Got You ( I Feel Good ) ( both from 1965 ) , were his first Top 10 pop hits , as well as major #1 R&amp;B hits - each remaining the top-selling singles , in black venues , for over a month . As the 1960s neared their end , Brown continued to refine the new funk idiom . His 1967 #1 R&amp;B hit , Cold Sweat - sometimes cited as the first true funk song - was the first of his recordings to contain a drum break and harmony reduced to a single chord change . His recordings influenced many contemporaries / followers , most immediately : Sly &amp; The Family Stone , Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band , Booker T. &amp; the M.G. 's , Edwin Starr , The Temptations , David Ruffin , Dennis Edwards and The Jackson 5 's young lead singer , Michael Jackson , took Brown 's shouts / dancing into pop mainstream . Many Clyde Stubblefield ( drums ) / The Famous Flames tracks were resurrected , from the 1970s onward , by countless hip-hop musicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remain , the world 's most sampled recording artists , with their Funky Drummer break becoming the most sampled individual piece of music , the Funky Drummer break . By 1970 Brown and Byrd employed a new band that included future funk greats , such as bassist Bootsy Collins , Collins ' guitarist brother Phelps ' Catfish ' Collins and trombonist and musical director Fred Wesley . This new backing band was dubbed The J.B. 's , and the band made its debut on Brown 's 1970 single Get Up ( I Feel Like Being A ) Sex Machine . Many of his sidemen and supporting players , such as Fred Wesley &amp; The J.B. 's , Bobby Byrd , Lyn Collins , Vicki Anderson and Hank Ballard , released records on Brown 's People label .

Although he would continue tour and rack up hit records into the 2000s , By the mid-1970s Brown 's star-status was on the wane , and key musicians in his band such as Fred Wesley left to join Parliament and Funkadelic . The onslaught of the slickly commercial style of disco caught Brown off guard , as it superseded his raw style of funk music on the dance floor . Brown is recognized by a plethora of ( mostly self-bestowed ) titles , including " Soul Brother Number One , " " Mr. Dynamite , " " the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business , " " Minister of New New Super-Heavy Funk , " " Universal James , " and the best-known , " the Godfather of Soul .

She was back home in Kansas City , relaxing after touring Europe and recording a new full-length album , " I Am What I Am " , backed by the Japanese funk powerhouse Osaka Monaurail . She 's also finishing work on a book , to be published in 2007 , that promises more juicy details about life as Soul Sister #1 before , during and after her time with the James Brown Revue ( including some details she would n't get into during our interviewcunning , that Marva ! ) . <p> We aired some excerpts from this interview during WEFUNK Show 447 , accompanied by a retrospective of Marva Whitney 's funk recordings from the studio and onstage . For another summary of Whitney 's history , check out her biography on soulpower.info , which I found very helpful in putting this article together . <p> We got right into the topic of funk as we began the interview . With no further ado ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of three , she was shaking her tambourine and singing in the local Pentecostal church . Music and religion were important elements that shaped both Marva 's and her mother 's formative years . <p> Marva went on to sing and tour with her family 's group , The Manning Gospel Singers ( she was born Marva Manning ) . At the age of 16 she joined the Alma Whitney Singers , and went on to marry Harry Whitney . During this period , she also tried singing R&amp;B and the blues for the first time . Being raised in a " Holy Roller " family , this understandably brought some trouble with her parents . <p> Unsatisfied with 9-to-5 work at a local garment manufacturer , and driven by her dream of a career performing onstage , Marva Whitney sang in Kansas City nightclubs and took part in talent competitions as she entered her 20 's . Local group Tommy &amp; The Derbys took Marva on as lead singer . As Kansas City 's most in-demand group they opened for virtually every big act that came through townIke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Drifters , and more . <p> Marva 's manager arranged a meeting with James Brown 's booking agent in 1966 when the James Brown Revue was scheduled to perform in Kansas . A riot at the show scuttled that chance , but a year later JB was back and she had another opportunity . She had already chosen to leave Tommy &amp; The Derbys as members of the group departed for LA seeking better fortune , and around the same time she also turned down offers from both Bobby Bland and Little Richard to join their touring shows . When James Brown came to town , Marva was mostly playing in the church and was n't particularly excited about the prospect of joining his revue . JB arrived on Easter Sunday , and although she had n't planned to go down to his show that afternoon , Marva heeded her manager 's advice and headed out for the meeting . She was a little put off that she had to sit through two consecutive James Brown shows before they made time for her to audition with " Pee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her audition , Pee Wee and Mr. Brown were impressed and immediately asked her to join the show and record with them . <p> James Brown flew her out to Cincinnati to complete the paperwork at King Records . Being dropped into a whole new level of the music business , she expected some training to prepare for the studio and performing for tens of thousands of people ... but that was not the James Brown way . Preparation for recording was minimal and you were expected to learn on the spot and give it all you 've got . For her first session , " Your Love Was Good To Me " in the summer of ' 67 , the backing track was already recorded and sitting in the vault before she arrived . Despite the fact that it was in the wrong key for her vocal range , there was nothing Marva could do but record her vocal track while they rolled tape and cut the record . <p> On tour with the James Brown Revue in 1967 and ' 68 , Marva Whitney performed in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ) and North Africa . The conditions she found in Africa were striking and unsettling , and she was uncomfortable receiving such reverence from the native Africans in the midst of abject poverty . <p> For those who worked for James Brown , perfection in musicianship and choreography was expected during every moment onstage . Soul Sister #1 received no special treatment , and any mistakes led to fines " and sometimes worse . " In the studio , Brown decided the lukewarm response to Marva Whitney 's first singlesall soul trackscalled for a change in direction . " Unwind Yourself " , released in January 1968 , forged Whitney 's now-familiar fiery funk sound . Several more raw funk singles ( " I 'm Tired , I 'm Tired , I 'm Tired " , " What Do I Have To Do ... " ) led the way to the song that broke her through to national recognition and a hit on the R&amp;B charts : " It 's My Thing " . Although James Brown rehearsed his own tracks on the road until he felt they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists like Marva recording was a more spontaneous and last minute affair . <p> Although musically the band was under James Brown 's firm and absolute direction , the songwriting process required a great deal of skilled " interpretation " on the band 's partespecially for bandleader " Pee Wee " Ellis , who had the challenging task of discerning and translating Brown 's grunting singsong into full arrangements for the band . Between the creative process and the musical arrangements themselves , it was demanding work for everyone involved . ( One of my favorite anecdotes about Brown is his audition of a guitar player : " Can you play a G7 chord ? " " Sure can . " " Can you do it for twenty minutes ? " ) . The repetitive , clock-like vamping of James Brown 's " new new super heavy " mode of funk eventually drove Fred Wesley , jazz-trained trombone player , to leave the group in a fit of frustration . <p> Marva Whitney is grounded and modest about her work , and there were aspects of being in the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . She mentioned to me that even being called " Soul Sister #1 " was something that took many years to get used to . <p> After touring for two and a half years with James Brown , recording two LPs and releasing at least 13 singles , Marva decided to leave the James Brown Revue and return to Kansas . Vickie Anderson ( whom Marva replaced in ' 67 ) returned to the Revue for some time , then Lyn " The Female Preacher " Collins joined as Brown 's featured female act . While speaking with me , Marva preferred to leave her reason for leaving JB as a detail to be discovered in her upcoming bookalthough she did provide a couple clues .... <p> Back in Kansas , Marva Whitney did n't waste much time .

In the early 80s Marva briefly got together with Coffee , Cream &amp; Sugar ( Marva was " Cream " ) , a group assembled by a gifted " musical nut " named Alfred " Pico " Payne who had previously sung with the Ink Spots . The group only performed a couple of times and did n't have any major gigs . <p> With the late 80s/early 90s came the ascendance of sampling in hip-hop , the British rare groove movement and , through both of those avenues , a big resurgence of interest in music related to James Brown . 45 King 's track " 900 Number " and the release of the " James Brown 's Funky People " compilation series brought Marva Whitney to the ears of a new generation of fans .

Under the ear of German producer DJ Pari , Marva and Osaka Monaurail began recording and performing , and the first result is the chugging funk of the single " I Am What I Am " .

@@37666698 @6666698/ <p> Pucho &amp; The Latin Soul Brothers ( better known as Pucho &amp; His Latin Soul Brothers ) , was a 60s / early-70s band , formed by Henry Brown ( b. 1 Nov 1938 , best known as Henry " Pucho " Brown ) , in 1959 . Somewhat forgotten , until 90s re-releases - few fused : jazz , Latin music , soul &amp; funk , nearly as well . Pucho did n't achieve the wide recognition of some other Latin jazz performers , exploring similar territory , e.g. : Mongo Santamaria , Willie Bobo &amp; Cal Tjader . The timbales player / bandleader may also have been too eclectic / open ( to outside influences ) , to achieve significant recognition amongst piers &amp; the , then contemporary , ' serious ' jazz community .

Fans of R&amp;B , rock , and Latin music can immediately connect with him , especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and danceable . His accessibility , however , has by no means compromised the quality of his material or his Latin Soul Brothers bands , which have featured fine and versatile players . Contrary to the assumptions of many listeners , Pucho himself is not Latino , but African-American . As a Harlem teenager , he cultivated loves for jazz , rhythm &amp; blues , and mambo . In the late ' 50s , he served for several years in the band of pianist Joe Panama . When the group broke up in 1959 , Pucho formed a band of his own , recruiting several alumni from Panama 's outfit . Even before he 'd cemented his reputation on record , Pucho 's band attracted notice from top Latin jazzmen . Willie Bobo took several musicians from Pucho 's band for his own group , as did Mongo Santamaria . One of the musicians that Santamaria lured away , in fact , was a young Chick Corea . Pucho began recording in 1963 , and really hit his stride between 1966 and 1970 , when he cut over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer a style termed Latin boogaloo , which mixed jazz , New York-style Latin music , R&amp;B/soul , and the sort of funk that was just emerging from James Brown and other performers . Pucho was n't afraid to mix up his material on his LPs , which placed originals by Brown and the Latin Soul Brothers next to covers of tunes by Herbie Hancock , the Temptations , the Beatles , Duke Ellington , and John Barry . This ensured a certain erratic flavor , but the groove was almost always on the money . The Latin Soul Brothers were at their best when they went for the hottest and funkiest grooves , as on their fine version of " Canteloupe Island , " or eccentrically titled originals like " Soul Yamie " and " Vietnam Mambo . " Once in a while , he even used engagingly raw soul vocals , as on the infectiously good-natured " Shuckin ' and Jivin ' , " which could have been an R&amp;B hit . The Latin Soul Brothers certainly could n't have been accused of predictability , incorporating straight modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their repertoire when the mood suited them . The constant factor was the active Latin percussion section , featuring conga , bongos , and Pucho 's own timbales . When his brand of Latin-soul-jazz fusion started to fall from commercial grace in the early ' 70s , Pucho disbanded the Latin Soul Brothers . For the next 20 years , he made his livelihood by performing conventional Latin music in the Catskill Mountain resorts of New York State . In the early ' 90s , however , Pucho 's back catalog began to generate interest in Britain , where he was a hit with the acid jazz crowd , and where several albums were reissued by the Ace label . Happily , he made a return to Latin-soul-jazz-funk with his 1995 comeback effort , Rip a Dip , which found his skills intact . How 'm I Doing followed in mid-2000 .

The Isleys ( as they are commonly called ) were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 . First formed in the early ' 50s , the Isleys have enjoyed one of the longest , most influential , and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music " over the course of nearly a half century of performing , the group 's distinguished history spanned not only two generations of Isley siblings but also massive cultural shifts which heralded their music 's transformation from gritty R&amp;B to Motown soul to blistering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised in Lincoln Heights , Ohio , where they were encouraged to begin a singing career by their father , himself a professional vocalist , and their mother , a church pianist who provided musical accompaniment at their early performances .

The group was comprised of Ronald , Rudolph , O'Kelly , and Vernon Isley ; after Vernon 's 1955 death in a bicycling accident , tenor Ronald was tapped as the remaining trio 's lead vocalist . In 1957 , the brothers went to New York City to record a string of failed doo wop singles ; while performing a spirited reading of the song " Lonely Teardrops " in Washington , D.C. , two years later , they interjected the line " You know you make me want to shout , " which inspired frenzied audience feedback .

@@37666749 @6666749/ <p> Eric B. &amp; Rakim were a hip-hop duo from New York City , New York , United States composed of DJ Eric Barrier ( born November 8 , 1965 ) and MC Rakim ( born William Michael Griffin Jr . ) . The duo went on to release 4 studio albums with their 1987 , Paid in Full being regarded as one the most influential albums in Hip Hop . In 1988 , they released their second album titled , Follow The Leader . They later continued to release two more albums in 1990 , Let the Rhythm Hit ' Em and in 1992 , Do n't Sweat the Technique in which they went on to split in that same year . Eric B. &amp; Rakim were almost universally recognized as the best DJ &amp; MC duo . Not only was their chemistry superb , but individually , each represented the absolute peak in their respective skills . Eric B. was a hugely influential DJ and beatmaker whose taste for hard-hitting James Brown samples touched off a stampede through the Godfather of Soul 's back catalog that continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still tops fan polls as the greatest MC of all time . He crafted his rhymes like poetry , filling his lines with elaborate metaphors and complex internal rhymes , and he played with the beat like a jazzman , earning a reputation as the smoothest-flowing MC ever to pick up a mic . His articulation was clear , his delivery seemingly effortless , and his influence on subsequent MCs incalculable . Together , their peerless technique on the microphone and turntables upped the ante for all who followed them , and their advancement of hip-hop as an art form has been acknowledged by everyone from Gang Starr to the Wu-Tang Clan . While certain elements of their sound might come off as slightly dated today , it 's also immediately clear how much of a hand Eric B. &amp; Rakim had in leading hip-hop into the modern age .

Barrier played trumpet and guitar early on , but switched to the turntables in high school , and eventually landed a job as the mobile DJ for radio station WBLS .

Is President " ( an ode to Barrier 's DJ skills ) b/w " My Melody " -- was released on the tiny Harlem-based indie label Zakia . It was a street-level sensation during the summer of 1986 , and the duo was picked up by the larger 4th &amp; Broadway imprint . The equally monumental singles " I Ai n't No Joke " and " I Know You Got Soul " sampled James Brown and his cohort Bobby Byrd , respectively , and their utter funkiness began to revolutionize the sound of hip-hop . Moreover , Rakim 's line " pump up the volume " on the latter track was in turn sampled itself , becoming the basis for M/A/R/R/S ' hit of the same name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full-length debut , Paid in Full ; accompanied by a mighty underground buzz , the record climbed into the Top Ten on the R&amp;B LP charts ( as would all of their subsequent albums ) .

The exposure helped make " Paid in Full " ' s drum track one of the most sampled beats this side of James Brown 's " Funky Drummer " ; it provided the foundation for Milli Vanilli 's " Girl You Know It 's True , " among many other , more credible hits . On the heels of Paid in Full , Eric B. &amp; Rakim signed with MCA subsidiary Uni and consolidated their reputation with another landmark hip-hop album , 1988 's Follow the Leader .

Unfortunately , the resulting tension over the future of their partnership ultimately destroyed it .

As originators of the unique Stax sound , the group was one of the most prolific , respected , and imitated of its era .

Having two white members ( Cropper and Dunn ) , Booker T. &amp; the M.G.

The group consisted of four core members : Booker T. Jones on keyboards and organ ( as well as many other instruments ) , Steve Cropper on guitar , Al Jackson Jr . on drums , and Donald " Duck " Dunn on bass . Cropper and Dunn were originally in the first house band for Stax , The Mar-Keys , and later were part of the Blues Brothers , both in the band and in the movie .

" The anchors of the Booker T. sound were Steve Cropper , whose slicing , economic riffs influenced many other guitar players , and Booker T. Jones himself , who provided much of the groove with his floating organ lines . In 1960 , Jones started working as a session man for Stax , where he met Cropper . Cropper had been in the Mar-Keys , famous for the 1961 instrumental hit " Last Night , " which laid out the prototype for much of the MG 's ( and indeed Memphis soul 's ) sound with its organ-sax-guitar combo .

Though they 'd become established stars by the end of the decade , the group began finding it difficult to work together , not so much because of personnel problems , but because of logistical difficulties .

In this sense , he can be compared to Smokey Robinson , who also managed to find time to write and produce many classics for other soul stars . Mayfield was also an excellent guitarist , and his rolling , Latin-influenced lines were highlights of the Impressions ' recordings in the ' 60s . During the next decade , he would toughen up his guitar work and production , incorporating some of the best features of psychedelic rock and funk . Mayfield began his career as an associate of Jerry Butler , with whom he formed the Impressions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit in 1958 with " For Your Precious Love , " Butler , who had sung lead on the record , split to start a solo career . Mayfield , while keeping the Impressions together , continued to write for and tour with Butler before the Impressions got their first Top 20 hit in 1961 , " Gypsy Woman . " Mayfield was heavily steeped in gospel music before he entered the pop arena , and gospel , as well as doo wop , influences would figure prominently in most of his ' 60s work . Mayfield was n't a staunch traditionalist , however . He and the Impressions may have often worked the call-and-response gospel style , but his songs ( romantic and otherwise ) were often veiled or unveiled messages of black pride , reflecting the increased confidence and self-determination of the African-American community . Musically he was an innovator as well , using arrangements that employed the punchy , blaring horns and Latin-influenced rhythms that came to be trademark flourishes of Chicago soul . As the staff producer for the OKeh label , Mayfield was also instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul singers who went on to national success . With Mayfield singing lead and playing guitar , the Impressions had 14 Top 40 hits in the 1960s ( five made the Top 20 in 1964 alone ) , and released some above-average albums during that period as well . Given Mayfield 's prodigious talents , it was perhaps inevitable that he would eventually leave the Impressions to begin a solo career , as he did in 1970 . His first few singles boasted a harder , more funk-driven sound ; singles like " ( Do n't Worry ) If There 's a Hell Below , We 're All Gon na Go " found him confronting ghetto life with a realism that had rarely been heard on record . He really did n't hit his artistic or commercial stride as a solo artist , though , until Superfly , his soundtrack to a 1972 blaxploitation film . Drug deals , ghetto shootings , the death of young black men before their time : all were described in penetrating detail . Yet Mayfield 's irrepressible falsetto vocals , uplifting melodies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength that few others could have achieved . For all the glory of his past work , Superfly stands as his crowning achievement , not to mention a much-needed counterpoint to the sensationalistic portrayals of the film itself . At this point Mayfield , along with Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye , was the foremost exponent of a new level of compelling auteurism in soul . His failure to maintain the standards of Superfly qualifies as one of the great disappointments in the history of black popular music . Perhaps he 'd simply reached his peak after a long climb , but the rest of his ' 70s work did n't match the musical brilliance and lyrical subtleties of Superfly , although he had a few large R&amp;B hits in a much more conventional vein , such as " Kung Fu , " " So in Love , " and " Only You Babe .

He is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of gangsta rap , who initially rose to fame as the founder of the rap group N.W.A. Eazy-E 's style was marked by his youthful , high-pitched voice and his lyrics focusing on elements of urban street life , such as : The procurement and use of firearms , the distribution , acquirement &amp; ingestion of illegal narcotics , frequent engagements in enthusiastically unconventional sexual acts and the relationship between members of the local police force and inhabitants of his neighborhood . His son , Lil Eazy-E , is also a rapper . In 1995 , Eazy-E was admitted into Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with what he believed to be bronchitis . Instead he was diagnosed with AIDS , and soon announced his illness publicly . He died shortly after , on March 26 , 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was 31 years old when he died . Eazy 's death from AIDS was probably due to his history of unprotected sex with female fans . During the week of March 20 , Eazy-E drafted his last message to fans .

But I feel it is now time to testify because I do have folks who care about me hearing all kinds of stuff about what 's up . " " Yeah , I was a brother on the streets of Compton doing a lot of things most people look down on -- but it did pay off .

" Just remember : " It 's YOUR real time and YOUR real life " Some of his closest friends have stated that these words were not all written by Eazy-E because they were adjusted by his lawyer for the press conference . This is probably due to the fact that Eazy-E used profanity in his statement . Some believe that before his death , Eazy had made amends with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre ( although others believe that only D.J . Yella saw Eazy while he was in hospital ) .

The son of Richard and Kathie Wright , dropped out of high school in the tenth grade and supported himself by selling drugs , later receiving a high school equivalency diploma . He used the profits from his drug sales to establish Ruthless Records . When Ruthless signees Dr. Dre and Ice Cube wrote " Boyz-n-the-Hood " , Ahmed Saaoud and Eazy E formed the group N.W.A with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube . Later , DJ Yella and Arabian Prince were added .

On the final N.W.A album , Niggaz4Life ( 1991 ) , some of the lyrics provoked outrage from many liberals and conservatives alike . Eazy-E included pistols and shotguns in videos for both " Alwayz into Somethin ' " and " Appetite for Destruction " . Disputes about money caused the group to break up . It was thought that Eazy-E and Jerry Heller were stealing money from the group . Ice Cube is believed to have left N.W.A for this reason , which he later referenced in his diss song , " No Vaseline " .

They were signed to Daptone Records , where the Dap-Kings are the house band . They are widely thought to be spearheads of a revivalist movement that aims to capture the essence of funk/soul music as it was at its height in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s . Part of the way this is achieved is to shun modern digital recording methods in favour of using traditional analogue recording equipment . The type of instruments used by the band may also be considered limited to those that would have been available up until the mid seventies . Sharon Jones ( May 4 , 1956 " November 18 , 2016 ) , was born Sheron Lafaye Jones , in Augusta , Georgia , Her mother moved to Brooklyn , soon thereafter , however Jones was sent down south for a few months every year to stay with her family . As a child , she and her brothers would imitate the songs and dances of James Brown , who shared their home-town . Like many rhythm and blues entertainers , she began performing in church at a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies , she began singing outside of the church in talent shows and with local funk groups . Later she would make her living with a combination of sporadic session work as a mostly anonymous voice on various dance records ( sometimes credited as Lafaye Jones ) , singing with wedding bands , and a handful of day jobs which included stints as both a prison guard at New York 's notorious Riker 's Island , and an armored car guard for Wells Fargo Bank . In 1996 she was called in to sing back-up at a Desco Records studio session for 70 's soul legend Lee Fields . The original incarnation of the band , the Soul Providers , were formed in the mid nineties by Philip Lehman and Gabriel Roth AKA Bosco Mann . The Soul Providers began recording an album consisting of James Brown inspired instrumentals and vocal collaborations with Deep Funk legend Lee Fields . It was during these sessions that Roth and Lehman discovered vocalist Sharon Jones after she recorded backing vocals for one of the Lee Fields tracks . They were impressed enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a track that had originally been intended for a man to record . This track along with another Jones solo , " The Landlord " , were included on the Soul Providers debut release Soul Tequila , released circa 1996 on the French label Pure Records ( defunct ) . Lehman and Roth then started a new label in Brooklyn , New York . Desco Records was born taking its name from Desco Vacuum , a vacuum cleaner store in West 41st Street underneath which they utilised the basement as studio space and an office to administer and distribute the label . Sugarman 3 organist Adam Scone just happened to live upstairs in the same building . The Soul Tequila album was then reissued as a vinyl only LP renamed Gim me The Paw . The record , which featured Lehman 's pet dog Spike on the cover , only kept one of the Sharon Jones collaborations , " Switchblade " , omitting " The Landlord " . Having established a scene in New York of performers , Desco aimed to showcase a stable of artists with revue style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of artists including Sugarman 3 , The Daktaris , The Mighty Imperials , Naomi Davis &amp; The Knights of 41st Street , Lee Fields , Joseph Henry and Sharon Jones , who backed by the Soul Providers who had become the Desco house band , released three 45 's on the label . Desco Records were gaining intrigue and reputation for quality amongst soul/funk collectors and enthusiasts . Many people who bought the early records were unsure that they were modern recordings as recording dates were deliberately omitted from the labels and were often marketed as being released in the 1970s . Two other Soul Providers albums were released , an instrumental soundtrack to a mysterious Sam Lung Kung-Fu film , The Revenge Of Mr Mopoji , credited to Mike Jackson And The Soul Providers and a Lee Fields solo album Let 's Get A Groove On where the Soul Providers provided the backing . In 2000 , due to a growing difference of opinion , Lehman and Roth decided to go separate ways and both set up new labels . Philip Lehman set up Soul Fire Records ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Soul Records ) . Gabriel Roth went on to start Daptone Records with Sugarman 3 saxophonist Neal Sugarman . The Soul Providers split and a new band , the Dap-Kings formed . The band was consisted of label owners Roth AKA Bosco Mann on bass and Neal Sugarman on Saxophone , plus original Soul Providers : guitarist Binky Griptite , organist Earl Maxton , percussionist Fernando Velez and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi . Joining them were original members of the Mighty Imperials whose album , Thunder Chicken , was the last release on the Desco label : tenor saxophonist Leon Michels and drummer Homer Steinwess . Having secured a summer residency at The Boite , a club in Barcelona , Spain , the band recorded an LP , Dap Dippin ' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings in 2001 . A few hundred copies were pressed , so that sales during the residency would provide financial backing on what would have otherwise been a financially disastrous trip . With promotional copies reaching notable funk DJs and reviewers , the album gained a significant reputation and was officially released as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal acclaim amongst enthusiasts . An exhausting schedule of international shows then followed to promote the album and it quickly became clear that promotion of Sharon Jones would be key to the success of the Daptone label . Whilst trying to build upon the revue style stable showcasing and trying to record other groups and artists on the label , other projects have to a certain extent been sidelined in favour of building on the success of Sharon Jones . Expected albums from Lee Fields and Naomi Davis have so far been victim to a lack of time , funds and energy a small independent label has . Neal Sugarman 's own band Sugarman 3 who have themselves released several popular albums including one on the Daptone label , Pure Cane Sugar , have also been somewhat sidelined . Following the album , three 45 's of note , not included on the album where also released .

By this time there were a few personnel changes , as organist Earl Maxton and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi officially became members of Antibalas , a New York based afrobeat band . Whilst Maxton was not replaced on organ , Trumpeter David Guy was recruited on trumpet . Also from the Budos Band , Thomas Brenneck , a second guitarist was added . In 2003 the Daptone Recording Studio , complete with a sixteen track analogue tape machine was open for business . It was originally intended to record two albums back-to-back to speed up the next release process .

This album was a more broad based album than the first ( which almost completely consisted of funk numbers ) and included a mix of both soul and funk influences . The sleeve notes , written by Gabriel Roth , provided some insight into the vision behind the music , " Somewhere between banging on logs and the invention of M.I.D.I . technology we have made a terrible wrong turn . We must have ridden right past our stop . We should have stepped down off the train at that moment when rhythm and harmony and technology all culminated to a single Otis Redding whine . That moment of the truest , most genuine expression of what it means to be human . " The production and recording values of this album were also noticeably crisper than that of the first - attaining a sound similar to the kind of production standard achieved by James Brown at his height , rather than the slightly duller " scratchy 45 " sound of the original album . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily growing base of both fans and now imitators , the band embarked on more extensive international tours and promotion of the album . Leon Michels left the band soon after the release of Naturally to help start a new label Truth &amp; Soul Records on the back of a solo LP that was originally intended to be released on Daptone , Sounding Out The City , credited to El Michels Affair . The label would also fill the void left when Philip Lehman closed the Soul Fire label and moved to the Bahamas , leaving the scene altogether . The back catalogue of Soul Fire would then be handled by Truth &amp; Soul Records who , along with Soul Fire often used many of the same artists in their stable , such as Lee Fields , Homer Steinweiss and Thomas Brenneck but of whom Leon Michels had been the biggest collaborator .

Again various members of the band feature on Ronson 's second album , Version ( 2007 ) , providing contributions on all but one of the album 's fourteen tracks .

Thomas had his first success as a recording artist in 1953 with " Bear Cat , " a funny answer record to Big Mama Thornton 's " Hound Dog . " It made number three on the R&amp;B charts , giving Sun Records its first national hit , though some of the sweetness went out of the triumph after Sun owner Sam Phillips lost a lawsuit for plagiarizing the original Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller tune .

He was active in his local church 's gospel choir , The Zioneers and then made a local name for himself in the Gospel Starlighters . It was a time when Church elders disapproved of secular singing so Byrd and the other members of the Gospel Starlighters would leave the state to perform secular material as The Avons . Byrd provided vocals , piano and organ and led a group including : Sylvester Keels , Fred Pulliam , Doyle Onglesby , Nashpendle " Nash " Knox and Nafloyd Scott on guitar .

Brown was a remarkable tour de force of vitality and personality and within a short time he had not only joined the Avons but he was directing affairs changing their name to The Flames . Byrd recognised early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him : ' I did n't need him in competition , I needed him with me , that 's why I worked so hard to get him over to my group ' The group , with the addition of Johnny Terry and Baroy Scott on bass , moved to Macon , Georgia and signed with the King subsidiary label , Federal .

The power within the group was now with James Brown . At this point , The Famous Flames ceased being a vocal/instrumental group , and became a straight vocal group , as there was no need for additional instrumentalists , since Brown , in the interim , had already began to employ his own road band , the old J.C .

Over his career he has been known by several pseudonyms , including Kris Parker , KRS One , KRS-ONE ( as given at his site ) , The Blastmaster and The Teacha . KRS-One is an acronym for " Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody " . KRS-One is a significant figure in the hip hop community and is often referenced in works by other hip hop artists and critics as being the ' essence ' of an MC and one of the greatest to ever hold the mic . KRS-One , originally a member of the hip hop crew Boogie Down Productions , is known for setting the path for both hardcore rap and socially conscious political rap . Youth and early career Born Lawrence Parker in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965 , the future KRS-One grew up with his brother Kenny and their single mother in assorted inner city neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was 12 years old , he and his brother Kenny prepared a pan of flavored rice , which was to be the family 's dinner for the evening . The hungry pair ate the whole thing , and when their mother came home from work , she kicked them out of the apartment in a fit of anger . They stayed away for two days before younger Kenny decided to go back home , while Lawrence opted not to return . He spent the better part of the next seven years homeless , much of it at local libraries . In his late teen years , Lawrence Parker fell in with some illegal drug dealers and became a courier . Using a bread delivery truck as a cover , Parker and his partner drove around town to make drops . During one of their trips , a police car pulled up behind them with flashing lights . Parker 's partner panicked , and led the cops on a chase for several miles which ended with the truck crashing and the two being apprehended . At the trial , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had initially tried to pull them over was because they had private plates on a commercial vehicle , there was no original intent to search for drugs . Parker , still a minor , claimed he was a ward of the state , and got sent to a juvenile home for his sentencing , after which he was moved to a Covenant House youth homeless shelter . It was there that he met Scott Sterling , a recent college graduate who just started working at the shelter as a social worker . Parker discovered that Sterling moonlighted as a hip hop DJ under the name Scott La Rock . By this time , Parker had earned the nickname " Kris " from the relationship he had developed with local Hare Krishnas that evangelized near the shelter . Heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies , he was also an aspiring rapper , and practiced routines in verbal spars with the other shelter residents . Parker and Sterling , along with two other fellows , decided to form a rap group together , initially calling themselves " Scott La Rock and the Celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two peripheral members quit , leaving Parker ( now calling himself KRS-One ) and Sterling . They then decided to call themselves " Boogie Down Productions " . Success is the Word , a 12-inch single release on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records ( under the group name " 12:41 " ) did not enjoy commercial success . Soon after , the pair approached another NY indie , Rock Candy Productions , for a deal . As it turns out , the entertainment company was allegedly a front for a pornography operation , but Parker and Sterling convinced the boss to front them the money to record an album , under the newly created subsidiary label , B-Boy Records . After a few 12-inch single releases , the Criminal Minded album finally surfaced in 1987 . Criminal Minded featured many dis tracks that attacked other hip hop emcees and tracks about street crime ( " wa da da deng wa da da da deng , listen to my nine millimeter go bang " ) .

Musically , the album was based around James Brown samples and reggae influences . They also sampled hard-rock band AC/DC on " Dope Beat " . During these years , KRS-One was also famously involved in a hip hop battle with MC Shan , of Queensbridge . KRS objected to MC Shan calling Queensbridge the home of hip hop , and attacked him viciously on a seminal battle rap , The Bridge Is Over . Later career and emphasis on political issues Following the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987 , Boogie Down Productions ( BDP ) became increasingly political . KRS One was the primary motivation behind the HEAL compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement . KRS One attracted many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single " Self Destruction . " As Parker adopted this more conscientious , less violent approach , he stopped calling himself " The Blastmaster " ( his battle rap nickname ) , and instead began calling himself " The Teacha " , turning the nickname KRS-ONE into the backronym " Knowledge Reigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album , 1993 's Return of the Boombap , KRS worked together with producers DJ Premier ( Gang Starr ) , Showbiz and Kid Capri .

Other prominent guest artists on KRS One included Mad Lion , Busta Rhymes , Das EFX and Fat Joe . In 1997 , Parker surprised many with his release of the album I Got Next . The record included a remix of the single " Step into a World " which featured a sample from the 1970s rock group Blondie by commercial rap icon Puff Daddy .

In 1999 , there were tentative plans to release an album called " Maximum Strength " ; a lead single , " 5 Boroughs " , was released on The Corruptor movie soundtrack . However , KRS apparently decided to abort the album 's planned release , just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of A&amp;R at Reprise Records . KRS moved to southern California , and stayed there for two years , finally ending his relationship with Jive Records with A Retrospective in 2000 . The next year , he resigned his position at Reprise and in 2001 The Sneak Attack was released on Koch Records .

After touring with the Mitchell-Grey group for a year , Hutcherson settled in New York City ( on 165th street in The Bronx ) where he worked part-time as a taxi driver , before fully entering the jazz scene via his childhood friend , bassist Herbie Lewis .

In spite of the numerous post-bop , avant-garde , and free jazz recordings made during this period , Hutcherson 's first session for Blue Note as leader , The Kicker ( recorded in 1963 but not released until 1999 ) , demonstrated his background in hard bop and the blues , as did Idle Moments with Grant Green .

In 1994 , Mos also began his music career , forming the short-lived group Urban Thermo Dynamics ( UTD ) with his younger brother DCQ and his younger sister Ces .

Rolling Stone magazine named it the seventeenth best album of 2009 .

Socially aware rap music ( alternative hip hop ) has experienced something of a renaissance in the late 1990s and now the 2000s , in part due to artists such as Mos Def , Talib Kweli , Common , The Roots and others . " Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Blackstar " Mos Def 's collaboration with Talib Kweli was released during the aftermath of the deaths of 2pac and The Notorious B.I.G . sparking a rebirth of " aware " and " intelligent " hip-hop . Def 's music often references his Islamic faith and his contention that black artists receive little credit for their role in the birth of rock and roll music . On Mos Def 's 2004 album The New Danger , the rapper took his penchant for experimentation to a new level . Most of the songs were more hip-hop flavored stylings of Blues and Rock , with few actual raps thrown in . This threw off fans who were expecting another full-blown rap album . The New Danger also featured the controversial song " The Rape Over " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Takeover " : old white men is runnin this rap shit corporate forces runnin this rap shit some tall israeli is runnin this rap shit we poke out our asses for a chance to cash in cocaine , is runnin this rap shit ' dro , ' yac and e-pills is runnin this rap shit ... mtv is runnin this rap shit viacom is runnin this rap shit aol and time warner runnin this rap shit ... quasi-homosexuals is runnin this rap shit The lyrics would seem to have chafed with higher-placed executives , who made Mos take the song off of later releases of the album , supposedly for " sample clearance issues " .

@@37667030 @6667030/ <p> Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones , more commonly known as Nas ( formerly Nasty Nas and Escobar ) , born September 14 , 1973 in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , New York , is a prominent American MC . The son of jazz musician Olu Dara , he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge , New York . According to the Nasty Songfacts , as a teenager rapper , Nasir first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas . By the time he released his landmark solo debut album Illmatic in 1994 , Jones was known as Nas . Illmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time . He married R&amp;B singer Kelis in 2005 , they have one son together , and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009 . Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm , which released one album . In the years following the release of Illmatic , Nas pursued a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists . Furthermore , Nas ' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of " selling out " . Nevertheless , the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas ' credibility among fans . Since the success of Stillmatic , Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community , and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic . While Nas ' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work , it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers. 1973 " 1992 : Childhood and early career Nas was born in Brooklyn , New York , as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones 's two children ; his brother Jabari ( nicknamed " Jungle " because he was born in the Congo ) is the younger of the two . The family lived for a time in Brooklyn , before moving to Queensbridge , the largest public housing project in the United States . Olu Dara left the household in 1986 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys on her own . Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York . He educated himself , reading about African culture and civilization , the Qur'an , the Bible and the Five Percent Nation . He also studied the origin of hip hop music , taping records that played on his local radio station . As a child , Nas had wanted to be an instrumentalist ( at the age of three , Nas played his father 's trumpet on the step of their Brooklyn home ) and also a comic book artist . Shortly after his parents separated , Nas began to write short stories as he immersed himself deeper into hip-hop culture . By his preteen years , he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper , and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie " I 'll Will " Graham as his DJ . Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas . Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his group , Main Source . In 1991 , Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on " Live at the BBQ " , from Main Source 's LP Breaking Atoms . Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene , the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal . Nas and Graham continued to work together , but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23 , 1992. 1992 " 1995 : The recording and release of Illmatic In mid-1992 , Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass , who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year . Nas made his solo debut on the single " Halftime " from Serch 's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead . The single increased the buzz surrounding Nas and when MC Serch 's solo album is released later in the year , Nas ' standout appearance on " Back To The Grill " only intensified interest in his upcoming album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rakim , his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community . However , many were concerned that Columbia , being a major label , would try to dilute his New York based style . In 1994 , Nas ' debut album , Illmatic was finally released . Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created , Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor , Pete Rock , Q-Tip ( of A Tribe Called Quest ) and DJ Premier , as well as guest appearances from Nas ' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song " Life 's a Bitch " , Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics , and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time . Notable songs on the album included " NY State of Mind " ( produced by Premier ) , " The World Is Yours " ( produced by Pete Rock ) , " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't Hard To Tell " ( produced by Large Professor and featuring a sample of " Human Nature " by Michael Jackson ) . However , due in part to extensive bootlegging , the record sales fell below expectations . Following Illmatic , Nas appeared on AZ 's Doe Or Die album , and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates , Mobb Deep , on their album , The Infamous . One notable achievement during this period was Nas ' verse on " Verbal Intercourse " on Raekwon 's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx . After this appearance , Nas received a Source Quotable as he had the distinction of being the only non-Wu-Tang Clan member to be featured on one of the group 's solo albums. 1996 " 1998 : From It Was Written to The Firm Columbia began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics like the rapper The Notorious B.I.G. , who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal . Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute , and began preparation for his second LP , It Was Written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment , was released during the summer of 1996 . Two singles , " If I Ruled The World ( Imagine That ) " ( featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees ) and " Street Dreams " ( a remix features R. Kelly ) were instant hits . These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams , making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop . Other notable tracks on the album included " The Message " and " I Gave You Power , " which tells a story from the perspective of a gun . It Was Written also featured the debut of The Firm , a supergroup consisting of Nas , AZ , Foxy Brown , and Cormega . The album also introduced Nas 's Mafioso-inspired character " Nas Escobar " , who lived more of a Scarface/Casino-esque lifestyle . On the other hand , Illmatic , which , while having numerous references to Tony Montana and the theatrical hit featuring Al Pacino , was more about Nas ' life as a teenager in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Dre 's Aftermath Entertainment label , and began working on their debut album . Halfway through the production of the album , Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute , who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company . Cormega therefore became one of Nas ' most vocal opponents , releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas , Stoute , and Nature , who was Cormega 's replacement in The Firm . The Firm 's The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews and lackluster sales and the members of the supergroup went their separate ways . At about this time , Nas became a spokesperson for the Willie Esco urban clothing line , but had no other connection with the clothing line . He stopped promoting Willie Esco in 2000 , dissatisfied with the company 's operations . During the same period , Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams ' 1998 feature film Belly , which also featured DMX , Taral Hicks , and T-Boz of TLC among its cast . 1998 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nas began work on a double album to be entitled I Am ... The Autobiography , which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written . The album was completed in early 1999 , and a music video was shot for its lead single , Nas Is Like , produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from " It Ai n't Hard to Tell " . However , much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet , and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release . The second single for I Am was " Hate Me Now , " featuring Sean " Puffy " Combs ( now " Diddy " ) , was used as an example by Nas ' critics for moving towards commercial themes . Hype Williams shot an allegorical video for the single , which featured Nas and Puffy being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus ; After the video was completed , Combs , a Catholic , requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me Now " video made its way to MTV , and was premiered on April 15 , 1999 on TRL . A furious Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute 's office and assaulted him , at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle . Stoute pressed charges , but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June . Columbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am under the title Nastradamus during the latter half of 1999 , but , at the last minute , decided Nas should record an entirely new album for release . Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date . Though critics were not kind to the album , it did result in a minor hit , the Timbaland-produced " You Owe Me , " featuring R&amp;B singer Ginuwine . The only pirated track from I Am ... to make it onto Nastradamus was " Project Windows , " featuring Ronald Isley . A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes , a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 . The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews . 2000 " 2001 : The Nas vs . Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic The highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z 's protege , Memphis Bleek . On his debut album Coming of Age , Bleek made a song entitled " Memphis Bleek Is " , which was similar in concept to Nas ' single " Nas is Like " . On the same album , Bleek recorded " What You Think Of That " featuring Bleek 's mentor Jay-Z , which contains the refrain , " I'ma ball ' til I fall/what you think of that ? " . In retaliation , " Nastradamus " , the title track from Nas ' second 1999 album , featured a reference to " What You Think Of That " . The lyrics state , " You wan na ball till you fall , I can help you with that/You want beef ? I could let a slug melt in your hat . " Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on " Nastradamus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead single for his The Understanding LP , My Mind Right " . QB 's Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge , including Mobb Deep , Nature , Littles , The Bravehearts ( which included Nas ' younger brother Jungle among its members ) , and Cormega , who had briefly reconciled with Nas . The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante , MC Shan , and Marley Marl . Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single " Da Bridge 2001 " , which was based on Shan &amp; Marl 's 1986 recording " The Bridge " . " Da Bridge 2001 " also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek , in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster , including Bleek , Damon Dash , Beanie Sigel , and Jay-Z . Jay-Z responded to Nas ' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City , when he premiered his song " Takeover .

On his 2001 album , The Blueprint , Jay-Z rewrote " Takeover , " dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas , claiming that he had a " ... one hot album every ten year average " record ( referring to Illmatic ) that his flow was weak , and that he had fabricated his past as a hustler . Nas responded with " Ether " , the track begins with gunshots and a repeated , slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping " Fuck Jay-Z. " ( taken from Tupac 's " Fuck Friends " ) In " Ether , " Nas accuses Jay-Z of stealing ( " biting " ) lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G . and brown-nosing Nas and other rappers for fame .

Jay-Z responded to " Ether " with a freestyle entitled " Supa Ugly . " going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan , the mother of Nas ' daughter Destiny . Nas dismissed the track by claiming that he was no longer with Bryan during the time the affair took place . In a recent interview , however , New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing " Ether " and " Supa Ugly , " and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes .

The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging . Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year . Vibe Magazine gave it 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics . The second single , the inspirational " I Can " , which reworked elements from Beethoven 's " Fur Elise " , became Nas ' biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003 , garnering substantial radio airplay on urban , rhythmic , and top 40 radio stations , as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks .

The album 's first singles were " Thief 's Theme " and " Bridging the Gap " , which features his father Olu Dara on vocals . The album also includes " These are Our Heroes " , which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as Kobe Bryant , Lenny Henry , Tiger Woods , and Cuba Gooding , Jr . of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values . The videos for " Bridging the Gap " and " Just A Moment " received moderate airplay on MTV and BET . Although the album went platinum , its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper 's previous releases . Nas was featured on Kanye West 's album Late Registration on a song titled " We Major " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album , but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song . He also appeared on Damian Marley 's song " Road to Zion " ( which also featured newcomer The Game in the video , widening Nas ' still growing universally appreciated raps ) and several other songs such as " Death Anniversary " and " It Was n't You " ( featuring Lauryn Hill ) . In addition , Nas was most recently married to the R&amp;B singer Kelis , who is mostly known for her work internationally , but nonetheless released great hits in the U.S. The couple wed on Jan. 8 , 2005 in Atlanta , GA , after a two-year engagement . During this time , Nas announced that his next album would be entirely self-produced and feature no other rappers , and would be titled Nasir , and later that the project would feature other producers after all and would be called Nasdaq : Dow Jones .

" Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate , remarking " 50 has got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him . " Nas eventually decided to retaliate , and in July 2005 released " Do n't Body Ya Self ( MC Burial ) " , a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew , stating that 50 was " a sucka for death if I 'm a sucka for love . " However , despite all of this , Nas still claims to " have a lot of love towards 50 , " claiming 50 did n't understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records . In January 2006 , Nas signed a label deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher . His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records . He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named , " Hip Hop is Dead ... the N , " the N being a play on the word the " end . " The title is supposed to reflect what some would term the current low quality of rap music . The highly anticipated album is due out in December 19th , 2006 . Musical style and Technique Nas has long been famed for his creativity and storytelling prowess , which has earned him acclaim from both the hip-hop community and critics . In his early stages , from his first appearance on the Main Source 's Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic , he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics , complex lyrical schemes ( which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes ) , and witty phrasing and imagery . As he progressed and matured , Nas began to branch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping technique . Following Illmatic 's release , Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity . For instance , " Undying Love " ( featured on I Am ... ) is a tale of his wife 's betrayal told in first person , " Rewind " ( featured on Stillmatic ) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards , while on " I Gave You Power " ( featured on It Was Written ) , Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence . Over the years Nas ' style has changed significantly . In contrast to his previous work , Nas ' most recent material is distinctively socially aware and often politically inflammatory .

He first achieved prominence in the 1950s where his recordings became popular on jukeboxes before there were commonly used terms to describe his unique musical flavor . In the sixties and seventies he helped create the jazz style known as soul jazz . Smith employed a unique technique to emulate a string bass player on the organ . Although he played walking bass lines on the pedals on ballads , for uptempo tunes , he would play the bass line on the lower manual and use the pedals for emphasis on the attack of certain notes . His solos were characterised by percussive chords mixed with very fast melodic improvisation with the right hand . Smith was a prolific recording artist .

@@37667088 @6667088/ <p> Ellas McDaniel ( born Ellas Otha Bates , December 30 , 1928 " June 2 , 2008 ) , known as Bo Diddley , was an American rhythm &amp; blues and rock &amp; roll singer , guitarist , songwriter and music producer . He is cited as a key figure in the transition of blues into rock and roll , by introducing more insistent , driving rhythms and a harder-edged guitar sound . His use of African rhythms and the signature " Bo Diddley beat " , a simple five-accent hambone rhythm , is a cornerstone of r&amp;b , rock , pop and hip hop . In recognition of his achievements , he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and a Grammy Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences . He is also recognized for his technical innovations , including his distinctive rectangular guitar . Born in McComb , Mississippi , as Ellas Otha Bates , he was adopted and raised by his mother 's cousin , Gussie McDaniel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family moved to the South Side of Chicago , where he dropped the Otha and became Ellas McDaniel . He was an active member of Chicago 's Ebenezer Baptist Church , where he studied the trombone and the violin , becoming so proficient on the violin that the musical director invited him to join the orchestra . He performed until he was 18 . However , he was more interested in the pulsating , rhythmic music he heard at a local Pentecostal church and took up the guitar . Inspired by a performance by John Lee Hooker , he supplemented his income as a carpenter and mechanic by playing on street corners with friends , including Jerome Green ( c. 1934 " 1973 ) , in the Hipsters band , later renamed the Langley Avenue Jive Cats . Green became a near-constant member of McDaniel 's backing band , the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows . During the summer of 1943 " 1944 , he played at the Maxwell Street market in a band with Earl Hooker . By 1951 he was playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jody Williams , whom he had taught to play the guitar . Williams later played lead guitar on " Who Do You Love ? " ( 1956 ) . In 1951 he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club , on Chicago 's South Side , with a repertoire influenced by Louis Jordan , John Lee Hooker , and Muddy Waters . In late 1954 , he teamed up with harmonica player Billy Boy Arnold , drummer Clifton James and bass player Roosevelt Jackson and recorded demos of " I 'm a Man " and " Bo Diddley " . They re-recorded the songs at Chess Studios , with a backing ensemble comprising Otis Spann ( piano ) , Lester Davenport ( harmonica ) , Frank Kirkland ( drums ) , and Jerome Green ( maracas ) . The record was released in March 1955 , and the A-side , " Bo Diddley " , became a number one R&amp;B hit . The origin of the stage name Bo Diddley is unclear . McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name , which he suspected was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a singer his adoptive mother knew . Harmonicist Billy Boy Arnold said that it was a local comedian 's name , which Leonard Chess adopted as McDaniel 's stage name and the title of his first single . Guitar craftsman Ed Roman stated that it was McDaniel 's nickname as a Golden Gloves boxer . A diddley bow is a homemade single-string instrument played mainly by farm workers in the South . It probably has influences from the West African coast . In the American slang term bo diddly , bo is an intensifier and diddly is a truncation of diddly squat , which means " absolutely nothing " . On November 20 , 1955 , Bo Diddley appeared on the popular television program The Ed Sullivan Show . When someone on the show 's staff overheard him casually singing " Sixteen Tons " in the dressing room , he was asked to perform the song on the show . Because he could not read , when he saw " Bo Diddley " on the cue card , he thought he was to perform both his hit single and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo Diddley from his show , reputedly saying that he would n't last six months . Chess Records included Bo Diddley 's " Sixteen Tons " on the 1960 album Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger . Bo Diddley 's hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s : " Pretty Thing " ( 1956 ) , " Say Man " ( 1959 ) , and " You Ca n't Judge a Book by the Cover " ( 1962 ) . He also released numerous albums , including Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger and Have Guitar , Will Travel . These bolstered his self-invented legend . Between 1958 and 1963 , Checker Records released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums . In the 1960s he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences ( appearing at the Alan Freed concerts , for example ) , but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers . The album title Surfing with Bo Diddley derived from his influence on surf guitarists rather than surfing per se . In 1963 , Bo Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the Everly Brothers and Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting act . He wrote many songs for himself and also for others . In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the pop song " Love Is Strange " , a hit for Mickey &amp; Sylvia in 1957 . He also wrote " Mama ( Can I Go Out ) " , which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer Jo Ann Campbell , who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film Go Johnny Go . Bo Diddley included women in his band : Norma-Jean Wofford , also known as The Duchess ; Gloria Jolivet ; Peggy Jones , also known as Lady Bo , a lead guitarist ( rare for a woman at that time ) ; Cornelia Redmond , also known as Cookie V ; Debby Hastings , who led his band for the final 25 years . After moving from Chicago to Washington , D.C. , he set up one of the first home recording studios , where he not only recorded the album Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger but produced and recorded his valet , Marvin Gaye . Bo Diddley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first single to feature Gaye . It was released on Okeh Records , after the Chess brothers turned it down . During this time , Moonglows ' founder Harvey Fuqua sang backing vocals on many of Bo Diddley 's home recordings . Gaye later joined the Moonglows and followed them to Motown . Over the decades , Bo Diddley 's performing venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums . On March 25 , 1972 , he played with the Grateful Dead at the Academy of Music in New York City . The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as Volume 30 of the band 's concert album series , Dick 's Picks . Also in the early 1970s , the soundtrack of the ground-breaking animated film Fritz the Cat contained his song " Bo Diddley " , in which a crow idly finger-pops to the track . Bo Diddley spent some years in New Mexico , living in Los Lunas from 1971 to 1978 , while continuing his musical career . He served for two and a half years as a deputy sheriff in the Valencia County Citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three highway-patrol pursuit cars . In the late 1970s , he left Los Lunas and moved to Hawthorne , Florida , where he lived on a large estate in a custom-made log cabin , which he helped to build . For the remainder of his life he divided his time between Albuquerque and Florida , living the last 13 years of his life in Archer , Florida , a small farming town near Gainesville . In 1979 , he appeared as an opening act for the Clash on their US tour and in Legends of Guitar ( filmed live in Spain , 1991 ) , with B.B. King , Les Paul , Albert Collins , and George Benson , among others . He joined the Rolling Stones on their 1994 concert broadcast of Voodoo Lounge , performing " Who Do You Love ? " with the band . Sheryl Crow and Robert Cray also appeared on the pay-per-view special . From 1985 until he died , his touring band consisted of Jim Satten ( guitarist , band leader , musical director ) ; Scott " Skyntyte " Free , Nunzio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dave Johnson , Yoshi Shimada , Mike Fink or Sandy Gennaro ( drums ) ; John Margolis , Dave Keys or personal manager Margo Lewis ( keyboards ) ; and Debby Hastings ( bassist and musical director ) . Bo Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Johnnie Johnson and his band , consisting of Johnson on keyboards , Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass . In 2006 , he participated as the headliner of a grassroots-organized fundraiser concert to benefit the town of Ocean Springs , Mississippi , which had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina . The " Florida Keys for Katrina Relief " had originally been set for October 23 , 2005 , when Hurricane Wilma barreled through the Florida Keys on October 24 , causing flooding and economic mayhem . In January 2006 , the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs . When asked about the fundraiser , Bo Diddley stated , " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another " . In an interview with Holger Petersen , on Saturday Night Blues on CBC Radio in the fall of 2006 , he commented on racism in the music industry establishment during his early career , which deprived him of royalties from the most successful part of his career . His final guitar performance on a studio album was with the New York Dolls on their 2006 album One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This . He contributed guitar work to the song " Seventeen " , which was included as a bonus track on the limited-edition version of the disc . Bo Diddley fought the sportswear brand Nike in his later years over alleged copyright infringement , specifically over the use of his likeness and the slogan " You do n't know diddley . " In 1989 , he had worked with Nike on a commercial in the " Bo Knows " campaign and had entered into a licensing agreement with the company .

While recovering from the stroke and heart attack , Bo Diddley came back to his home town of McComb , Mississippi , in early November 2007 , for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the Mississippi Blues Trail . This marked his achievements and noted that he was " acclaimed as a founder of rock-and-roll . " He was not supposed to perform , but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson , who sang a song written for this occasion , Robinson sensed that Bo Diddley wanted to perform and handed him a microphone , the only time that he performed publicly after his stroke .

The " Bo Diddley beat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common bell patterns found in sub-Saharan African music traditions . One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944 " 55 , including two by Johnny Otis from 1948 . Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm . Sublette asserts , " In the context of the time , and especially those maracas ( heard on the record ) , ' Bo Diddley ' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record . A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only ' Rhumba ' on the track sheets . " The Bo Diddley beat is similar to " hambone " , a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms , legs , chest , and cheeks while chanting rhymes . Somewhat resembling the " shave and a haircut , two bits " rhythm , Diddley came across it while trying to play Gene Autry 's " ( I 've Got Spurs That ) Jingle , Jangle , Jingle " . Three years before his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hambone " , was cut by the Red Saunders Orchestra with the Hambone Kids . In 1944 , " Rum and Coca Cola " , containing the Bo Diddley beat , was recorded by the Andrews Sisters . Buddy Holly 's " Not Fade Away " ( 1957 ) and Them 's " Mystic Eyes " ( 1965 ) used the beat . In its simplest form , the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar or a two-bar phrase . Here is the count as a one-bar phrase : One e and ah , two e and ah , three e and ah , four e and ah ( the boldface counts are the clave rhythm ) . Many songs ( for example , " Hey Bo Diddley " and " Who Do You Love ? " ) often have no chord changes ; that is , the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece , so that the rhythms create the excitement , rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic tension and release . In his other recordings , Bo Diddley used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style to doo-wop , frequently with maracas by Jerome Green . An influential guitar player , Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack . His trademark instrument was his self-designed , one-of-a-kind , rectangular-bodied " Twang Machine " ( referred to as " cigar-box shaped " by music promoter Dick Clark ) built by Gretsch . He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years , most notably the " Cadillac " and the rectangular " Turbo 5-speed " ( with built-in envelope filter , flanger and delay ) designs made by Tom Holmes ( who also made guitars for ZZ Top 's Billy Gibbons , among others ) . In a 2005 interview on JJJ radio in Australia , he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment .

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of folk music themes . The song " Bo Diddley " was based on the African-American clapping rhyme " Hambone " ( which in turn was based on the lullaby " Hush Little Baby " ) . Likewise , " Hey Bo Diddley " is based on the song " Old MacDonald " . The song " Who Do You Love ? " with its rap-style boasting , and his use of the African-American game known as " the dozens " on the songs " Say Man " and " Say Man , Back Again , " are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music ( for example , " You got the nerve to call somebody ugly . Why , you so ugly , the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested " ) . The Bo Diddley Beat is a kind of syncopated five-accent clave rhythm . The Bo Diddley beat is named after Bo Diddley , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Bo Diddley was a rhythm and blues musician essentially , the beat is widely used in rock and roll and pop music . The " Bo Diddley Beat " ( 1955 ) is perhaps the first true fusion of 3-2 clave and R&amp;B/rock ' n ' roll . The Bo Diddley beat is essentially a 3-2 clave rhythm , one of the most common bell patterns found in Afro-Cuban music , and its origin goes back to the sub-Saharan African music traditions . But there is no documentation of a direct Cuban connection to Bo Diddley 's adaptation of the clave rhythm . The Latin connection was so strong that Bo Diddley used maracas as a basic component of his sound . Bo Diddley has given different accounts regarding how he began to use this rhythm . In an interview with Rolling Stones magazine , Diddley said he came up with the beat after listening to Gospel music in church when he was 12 years old .

According to ethnomusicologists , the Bo Diddley beat is similar to a folk tradition called " hambone " , a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms , legs , chest , and cheeks while chanting rhymes . " Handboning " can also be described as a form of corpophone - using your body for percussion . This is something that 's inherent in African-American culture . You do n't have a drum ? Your body is the next best thing . You clap , slap and stomp .

It 's the difference between copying and creating .

Frustrated that they had not seen any of the royalties for their hits and that they were only paid as members of the Revue , the gals were also replaced by groups of session singers to fulfill engagements elsewhere while the real group played second-fiddle , touring with the rest of the company . As if that were not enough , the fake Ikettes were often paid more than the real ones . With Tina 's sister Alline as their manager , the Ikettes left Ike and set up their own sixty-date tour .

Still , without hit records or big-name recognition , money from touring was not as lucrative as returning to session work , and the Mirettes disbanded in1970 . Meanwhile , new Ikettes to latch onto the Revue included P.P.

James Joseph Brown , 3 May 1933 , in Barnwell , SC , USA " d. 25 Dec 2006 ) , is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century music . He was a seminal force in the evolution of gospel and rhythm and blues into soul and funk . He has also left his mark on numerous other musical genres , including rock , jazz , reggae , disco , dance and electronic music , and hip-hop music . Joining Bobby Byrd 's vocal group The Famous Flames , in 1955 , Brown 's early mid-50s recordings were fairly straightforward gospel-inspired R&amp;B compositions , heavily influenced by contemporaries , including : Ray Charles and Little Richard , who was particularly significant in Brown 's development as a musician and showman . Brown followed his successful Live at the Apollo ( 1963 ) , with a string of singles that - along with the work of Allen Toussaint , in New Orleans - essentially defined the foundation of funk music . During the mid-1960s , two of Brown 's signature tunes Papa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Feel Good ) ( both from 1965 ) , were his first Top 10 pop hits , as well as major #1 R&amp;B hits - each remaining the top-selling singles , in black venues , for over a month . As the 1960s neared their end , Brown continued to refine the new funk idiom . His 1967 #1 R&amp;B hit , Cold Sweat - sometimes cited as the first true funk song - was the first of his recordings to contain a drum break and harmony reduced to a single chord change . His recordings influenced many contemporaries / followers , most immediately : Sly &amp; The Family Stone , Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band , Booker T. &amp; the M.G.

Many of his sidemen and supporting players , such as Fred Wesley &amp; The J.B. 's , Bobby Byrd , Lyn Collins , Vicki Anderson and Hank Ballard , released records on Brown 's People label .

The son of jazz musician Olu Dara , he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge , New York .

Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm , which released one album . In the years following the release of Illmatic , Nas pursued a more commercial direction , which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists . Furthermore , Nas ' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of " selling out " . Nevertheless , the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas ' credibility among fans . Since the success of Stillmatic , Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community , and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic . While Nas ' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work , it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in Brooklyn , New York , as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones 's two children ; his brother Jabari ( nicknamed " Jungle " because he was born in the Congo ) is the younger of the two .

Olu Dara left the household in 1986 , when Nas was 13 , and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own . Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York . He educated himself , reading about African culture and civilization , the Qur'an , the Bible and the Five Percent Nation . He also studied the origin of hip hop music , taping records that played on his local radio station .

By his preteen years , he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper , and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie " I 'll Will " Graham as his DJ . Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas . Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer and Flushing Queens resident Large Professor , who introduced Nas to his group , Main Source . In 1991 , Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on " Live at the BBQ " , from Main Source 's LP Breaking Atoms . Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene , the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal . Nas and Graham continued to work together , but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23 , 1992. 1992 " 1995 : The recording and release of Illmatic In mid-1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year .

Hailed as the second coming of Rakim , his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community . However , many were concerned that Columbia , being a major label , would try to dilute his New York based style . In 1994 , Nas ' debut album , Illmatic was finally released . Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created , Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor , Pete Rock , Q-Tip ( of A Tribe Called Quest ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song " Life 's a Bitch " , Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics , and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time .

However , due in part to extensive bootlegging , the record sales fell below expectations . Following Illmatic , Nas appeared on AZ 's Doe Or Die album , and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates , Mobb Deep , on their album , The Infamous . One notable achievement during this period was Nas ' verse on " Verbal Intercourse " on Raekwon 's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx .

Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute , and began preparation for his second LP , It Was Written , consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound . It Was Written , chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment , was released during the summer of 1996 . Two singles , " If I Ruled The World ( Imagine That ) " ( featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees ) and " Street Dreams " ( a remix features R. Kelly ) were instant hits .

The Firm signed to Dr. Dre 's Aftermath Entertainment label , and began working on their debut album . Halfway through the production of the album , Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute , who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company . Cormega therefore became one of Nas ' most vocal opponents , releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas , Stoute , and Nature , who was Cormega 's replacement in The Firm .

The Autobiography , which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written . The album was completed in early 1999 , and a music video was shot for its lead single , Nas Is Like , produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from " It Ai n't Hard to Tell " . However , much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet , and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me Now , " featuring Sean " Puffy " Combs ( now " Diddy " ) , was used as an example by Nas ' critics for moving towards commercial themes .

However , the unedited copy of the " Hate Me Now " video made its way to MTV , and was premiered on April 15 , 1999 on TRL .

A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes , a collection of underground Nas songs that was released by Columbia in September 2002 . The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews . 2000 " 2001 : The Nas vs . Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic The highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z 's protege , Memphis Bleek . On his debut album Coming of Age , Bleek made a song entitled " Memphis Bleek Is " , which was similar in concept to Nas ' single " Nas is Like " . On the same album , Bleek recorded " What You Think Of That " featuring Bleek 's mentor Jay-Z , which contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that ? " . In retaliation , " Nastradamus " , the title track from Nas ' second 1999 album , featured a reference to " What You Think Of That " . The lyrics state , " You wan na ball till you fall , I can help you with that/You want beef ? I could let a slug melt in your hat . " Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on " Nastradamus " as a diss , and therefore dissed Nas on the lead single for his The Understanding LP , My Mind Right " . QB 's Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge , including Mobb Deep , Nature , Littles , The Bravehearts ( which included Nas ' younger brother Jungle among its members ) , and Cormega , who had briefly reconciled with Nas . The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante , MC Shan , and Marley Marl .

" Da Bridge 2001 " also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek , in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster , including Bleek , Damon Dash , Beanie Sigel , and Jay-Z . Jay-Z responded to Nas ' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City , when he premiered his song " Takeover . " Initially , the song was to only be a Mobb Deep diss , only including one line about Nas near the end . Nevertheless , Nas recorded the " Stillmatic Freestyle , " an underground single which sampled Rakim and Eric B. 's " Paid in Full " beat , and attacked Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella label . On his 2001 album , The Blueprint , Jay-Z rewrote " Takeover , " dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas , claiming that he had a " ... one hot album every ten year average " record ( referring to Illmatic ) that his flow was weak , and that he had fabricated his past as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track begins with gunshots and a repeated , slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping " Fuck Jay-Z.

Ether was included on Nas ' fifth studio album , Stillmatic , released in December 2001 . Stillmatic managed to be not only a critically-acclaimed comeback album , but a commercial success as well , albeit not on the level of It Was Written and I Am ... ; the album debutted at #7 on the Billboard album charts and featured the singles " Got Ur Self A ... " and " One Mic . " In terms of commercial success , Jay 's The Blueprint was certified double-platinum , while Stillmatic went platinum . Jay-Z responded to " Ether " with a freestyle entitled " Supa Ugly . " going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan , the mother of Nas ' daughter Destiny . Nas dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan during the time the affair took place . In a recent interview , however , New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing " Ether " and " Supa Ugly , " and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes . By 2005 , the two rappers had eventually ended their feud without violence or animosity . During Jay-Z 's I Declare War - Power House concert , Jay-Z announced to the crowd , " It 's bigger than ' I Declare War ' . Let 's go , Esco ! " Nas then joined Jay-Z onstage , and the two then performed " Dead Presidents " together , which Jay-Z had sampled from Nas ' song " The World is Yours . " 2002 " Present : From God 's Son to Street 's Disciple and beyond In December 2002 , Nas released the God 's Son album . and its lead single , " Made You Look " . The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging . Time Magazine named his album best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics .

God 's Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas ' mother , who died of cancer in 2002 . In 2003 , Nas was featured on the Korn song " Play Me " , from Ko-n 's Take a Look in the Mirror LP . Nas released his seventh studio album , the critically acclaimed double-disc Street 's Disciple , on November 30 , 2004 . The album 's first singles were " Thief 's Theme " and " Bridging the Gap " , which features his father Olu Dara on vocals . The album also includes " These are Our Heroes " , which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba Gooding , Jr . of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values . The videos for " Bridging the Gap " and " Just A Moment " received moderate airplay on MTV and BET . Although the album went platinum , its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper 's previous releases . Nas was featured on Kanye West 's album Late Registration on a song titled " We Major " . West said the song was Jay-Z 's favorite on the album , but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song . He also appeared on Damian Marley 's song " Road to Zion " ( which also featured newcomer The Game in the video , widening Nas ' still growing universally appreciated raps ) and several other songs such as " Death Anniversary " and " It Was n't You " ( featuring Lauryn Hill ) .

Neither of these albums ever materialized . At a free concert in Central Park , New York , Nas made a statement regarding the quality of 50 Cent 's music . " this is the real shit , not that 50 Cent shit ! " In response , 50 Cent included a stab at Nas by speaking negatively of his wife Kelis on his single " Piggy Bank , " implying that Kelis was promiscuous and calling Nas a " sucker for love . " Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate , remarking " 50 has got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him . " Nas eventually decided to retaliate , and in July 2005 released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew , stating that 50 was " a sucka for death if I 'm a sucka for love . " However , despite all of this , Nas still claims to " have a lot of love towards 50 , " claiming 50 did n't understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records . In January 2006 , Nas signed a label deal with Jay-Z 's Def Jam , further emphasizing the Jay-Z/Nas truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher . His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records . He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named , " Hip Hop is Dead ... the N , " the N being a play on the word the " end .

In his early stages , from his first appearance on the Main Source 's Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic , he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics , complex lyrical schemes ( which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes ) , and witty phrasing and imagery . As he progressed and matured , Nas began to branch out into different subjects and developed a richer voice and slower rapping technique . Following Illmatic 's release , Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity . For instance , " Undying Love " ( featured on I Am ... ) is a tale of his wife 's betrayal told in first person , " Rewind " ( featured on Stillmatic ) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards , while on " I Gave You Power " ( featured on It Was Written ) , Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence .

Furthermore , controversial songs such as " My Country " and " A Message to the Feds ( Fuck The Police II ) " ( which are featured on Stillmatic and Street 's Disciple , respectively ) question the conduct of the American government .
