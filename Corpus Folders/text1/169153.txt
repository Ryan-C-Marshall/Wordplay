They vary widely in size and color , from six inches to five feet . There are 20 varieties and all but one live in Latin America . Armadillos get their name from their armor , which Kipling fictionally attributes to the tortoise teaching the hedgehog to swim . They dig up burrows and can sleep up to 16 hours a day .

Fruit bats are different from garden-variety bats because they do not use echolation to navigate . Instead , they rely on their large eyes and noses to sense things out ; that 's why their faces resemble other land mammalslike dogs .

They stand five feet high and weigh over 70 pounds each . <p> The African legend does not specify where one should touch the statues to ensure fertility .

The organizers were expecting that a few extras would find their way onto Max Yasgurs farm , but even with that , they only expected a total of 200,000 people . <p> They were wrong by half , and when 400,000 people showed up , it did n't  take long for their food stores to run dangerously low . <p> No major food vendors wanted to tackle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle their feeding needs . <p> It is no surprise at all that this was a really bad idea .

A boatswain was the foreperson on deck , in charge of managing the crew on duty and directing any rigging , anchoring , or cabling of the ship . <p> Crossed cannons : - A pair of crossed cannons designated military service among sailors . Though you might think of an old naval warship equipped with just cannons , many early navies also used sharpshooters on deck and in rigging to fire at enemy ships decks . In some cases , crossed guns could mean a sailor was such an appointed sniper instead of a cannoneer . <p> Compass Rose : - Not all tattoos were supposed to mark service or accomplishments ; some tattoos were meant to act as talismans of protection for the sailor and ship carrying them . A compass rose may not have actually worked as a compass but was supposed to help keep sailors from getting lost , and remind them of the way home . <p> Star : - A star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against being lost at sea , but instead was meant to protect- a sailor lost overboard or otherwise stranded at sea . <p> Harpoon : - Harpoons were a direct reference to whaling and as such were symbols of time aboard a fishing boat or service in a fishing fleet . Though the harpoon was simply a tool of the trade , many eventually came to associate it as a symbol of protection against vengeful whales and sea monsters . <p> Fully rigged ship : - A fully rigged ship was evidence that a sailor had crossed the dangerous waters of Cape Horn , also known as Tierra del Fuego " Land of Fire . Occupying the southernmost tip of South America , Cape Horn was dreaded by many sailors ; the rough waters required a ship to travel under full sail . Mutinies have even been recorded against captains ordering the navigation of these notorious waters . <p> Turtle : - Turtles were well known by sailors for being stalwart travelers of the sea , and turtles were the mark of a sailor who had crossed the equator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feat , and some sailors even got tattoos of both to mark their achievement . <p> Dragon : - A Chinese dragon celebrated a sailors trip to the Orient , and a golden dragon meant they had crossed the International Date Line. - Dragons have long marked the backs of sailors and pirates in the Asian Pacific . Asia was the birthplace of the original marriage between sailors and tattoos , but as time went on , many countries in the region began associating tattoos with pirates and brigands , eventually outlawing tattoos . <p> Hula Girl : - The hula girl was made popular by tattooists like Sailor Jerry , who helped popularize tattoos among Navy soldiers during World War II . A hula girl meant a trip to Hawaii , and to many soldiers was a reminder of the attack on Pearl Harbor .

They believed putting the tattoos on their feet would keep the ocean from pulling them down . <p> from " Master and Commander " <p> HOLD FAST : - Hold fast written on your knuckles was meant to help you do just that " hold fast . A charm on the fingers to keep ropes from slipping through them ; a seamans dexterity with rope was what earned his salt . A rope around - the wrist or a knot on the forearm was also worn by deck hands and dock tenders . <p> Swallows : - A sailor normally got a swallow when he first left home .

A sort of memento mori " the sailor would not only be reminded of their friends death , but of how treacherous the sea can be . <h> Other Superstitions <p> Tattoos , of course , are n't the only symbolic practices in sailing culture . The golden hoop earrings synonymous with pirates and brigands were often thought to be a way to pay for a funeral if a sailor died , or even as a safeguard against drowning . <p> If those ideas seem to be counter to each other , the almost global diversity of sailors has made many superstitions that are n't just different , but sometimes the exact opposite of each other . <p> Whistling , for example , was thought by some to be bad luck , thinking that the wind would see whistling as a direct challenge and summon mighty storms .

So you need power to the pumps and so forth . There were emergency diesel generators that would start and supply power in the event of a reactor shut down .

So operators were trying to see if the steam turbines powered by the reactor generated steam itself would supply enough power to run all the reactor systems as it was slowing down and stopping after a shut down , to bridge the gap between the time it took to get the generators running . Sort of an insurance policy , so they were never without enough power . <p> There was a minimum reactor power level specified to perform this experiment , because a reactor of this type is very difficult to control at low power and rather unstable .

So the minimum power requirements were not being met for this test , operators got the reactor in a dangerous state of operation by trying to increase the power too quickly to again reach the required safe level for the test . Operator error and safety design flaws contributed . Most of the safety control rods had been removed from the core to try and increase the power level . The reactor power then spiked massively , an estimated 10 times higher than the maximum operating level , instantly flash evaporating all the water coolant inside the core to superheated steam . The steam pressure threw the enormous 900 tonne concrete shield clean off the top of the core and blew the building to pieces , scattering bits of the cores fuel rods all over the place and releasing enormous amounts of radioactive particles contained in steam and gases .

This gives her a roadmap of where each individual strip of paper will go . She then folds and bends the paper how she needs it , and starts the process of gluing each one into place . It can take anywhere from a couple hours to weeks or more to create one completed piece . It all depends on how detailed the finish work has to be . <p> But whereas traditional quilling techniques relied on basic shapes , Yulia is manipulating the paper into more intricate designs in favor of creating even more vibrant and detailed works .

Tarantism , an Italian superstition asserts that dancing could separate the venom of scorpions and tarantulas from human blood .

Introducing the Ripley 's Olympics . <h> 2016 Summer Olympics <p> Everyone knows the Summer Olympics are kicking off on August 5th . As a disclaimer , the Summer Games are my favorites ! For the next 16 days , my TV will not leave Olympic coverage . Theres basketball , volleyball , swimming , diving , gymnastics , track and field . There are also more out of the way sports like fencing , archery , synchronized swimming , and rowing . But here at Ripleys , those sports are n't  quite weird enough for us . So we figured wed make a few suggestions for the 2020 Olympics to- give the event a Ripleys twist . Introducing Ripleys Olympics ! <h> Cherry-Pit Spitting <p> By Fabricio Cardenas via Wikimedia <p> The qualifications to be considered for the Games is simple : be fun , be entertaining , be weird . <p> The first competition that should be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Practiced for years , the noble art of Cherry-Pit Spitting is perfect for the Olympiad . <p> There are already cherry festivals all over the world , so the competition already has- an international profile . <p> Also , cherries are traditionally a summer fruit with harvests beginning in early May and lasting through the summer months depending on the kind of cherry . This means there would be an abundance of cherries available for the Games . <p> Cherry-pit spitting is also an activity that anyone can participate in . Men , women , and children regularly compete in events around the world . Young people have competed and will continue to compete in the Games before , but Cherry-pit spitting might be the kind of competition where we see the first Elementary-aged medal winner . <h> Sumo Baby Crying <p> Another way- for young people to be included in the Games would be to introduce the Japanese Baby Crying competition as an Olympic Event . <p> Granted , this will not give an infant the chance to medal , but it would be an interesting thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby crying contest , two sumo wrestlers work to get to different babies crying . The wrestler who makes their baby cry first , loudest , or longest , is deemed the winner . <p> This sport lends itself to a kind of tournament bracket style of competition with the best sumo wrestler from each country going head-to-head in single-elimination bouts until there 's only one left standing . <p> There 's a lot of cheering and celebrating during competitions , but this is sure to be the loudest event at the summer Games . <h> Ferret Legging <p> Cherry-pit spitting and sumo baby crying might be solid entry points to the Ripleys Olympics , but the real winners are the next two suggestions . <p> It would n't be a Ripleys sporting competition without a little ferret legging . <p> In a ferret legging competition , people take fanged and clawed ferrets and put them in their pants .

The record so far is five hours , but on an Olympic stage , I 'm sure that could be bested . <p> Ferret legging would be the perfect event to put on during the late night hours when networks need a long event to air to hold them over until morning . <h> Toe Wrestling <p> Another Ripleys favorite is toe wrestling . <p> Greco-Roman Wrestling is a long time staple of the Olympic Games . But singlets will have to move aside for toe-jam when this sport takes off . <p> In toe-wrestling , two players lock toes and then try to pin each others foot to the side wall . There are three rounds per bout , and the winner of the best two out of three rounds is declared the winner . <p> Proponents of toe-wrestling have already tried to get it included as an Olympic event , but maybe now with Ripleys backing it , we can get a little more traction . <p> The International Olympic Committee considers new sports each year .

A single work has taken him up to 30 hours of work and the detail that time brings is clearly seen in his art ! <p> What makes him even more amazing is he does this just in his free time ! Samuel calls his art his hobby . His real job ? He has a degree in law and practices as a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he draws with : <p> Ballpoint pen is not my only medium , its just the one I 'm currently trying to master . At this point in my life I 'm fairly proficient with chalk , pencil , color pencil , pastels , oils and acrylics . Maybe one day I 'll create an account just to share those . <h> He Answered Questions on his Portfolio <p> Q : How many colors do you have and what pens are these ? I have 8 colored Bic ballpoint pens , for this I used 6 of them plus black . They are just common everyday ballpoint pens . <p> Everything is 100% ballpoint pen . <p> Q : Where do you get them ? I have never seen them . Staples , Ebay , Amazon , and pretty much any good office supply store , just because you have n't noticed them before does n't  mean they do n't  exist ! <p> Q : Do you use any other medium mixed with the ballpoint pens ? No , I just use ballpoint pens for these drawings . Everything is 100% ballpoint pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you blend them ? I do n't  mix them nor blend them . Ballpoint pen ink dries instantly and can not be erased . I just cross hatch the different colors in layers to create the illusion of blending and the illusion of colors I do n't  actually have . <p> Q : Are you a professional Artist ? No , I 'm just a lawyer , art is just a hobby for me , although it takes from 20 to 500 hours or more to finish each drawing . I started drawing when I was 2 , that 's 29 years of experience . <p> I only draw for myself , as a hobby , to improve my own skills , to practice on my own , and because I love it , not to please critics . <p> Q : Do you trace the drawings , use projected images , what do you do to get the proportions ? No . I use a grid on the reference , I then draw another pencil grid on the paper to make the drawing the exact size I want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and then erase the pencil as I color the drawing . I look and draw , fully freehand , the traditional typical old way . At this point I do n't  need a grid , I can draw just by looking , I just use one to save time . <p> Q : Do you use photo manipulation , digital effects , drawing tablets or any other digital medium ? No . I like to do my work traditionally , the hard way , the way I like and the only way I know how . <p> Q : Some say drawing exact copies of photos is not art . I do n't  care what some people think and couldnt care any less ! I love realism , I only draw for myself , as a hobby , to improve my own skills , to practice on my own , and because I love it , not to please critics . Also , there are as many concepts of what is art as there are humans on earth , so what really matters is what art is for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is or what others think it should be . <p> He kind of slipped up on that church photo . My illusions are crushed . I accept nothing less than perfection . <p> ( just kidding ) <p> " Not art " ? Its creating something beautiful with your own hands . Its art . What is the difference between copying a image captured on film and one in front of your eyes ? Is a Roman statue not art because its just showing a person as the creator saw it ? Anyway , most of those statues you see werent actually carved by the master sculptor who the work is credited tohe carves a small statue the way he wants it , and other " workaday " sculptors exactly copy it on a larger scale . Does that mean that the large copy ca n't be considered art ? It takes talent on both ends , and snapping a photo is n't exactly as hard as conceiving and creating a statue .
