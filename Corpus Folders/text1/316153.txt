It was very clear early on that this program would be a better fit for my daughter than any of the other programs offered in our district . My Daughter has always brought home good grades but we found that the traditional school experience did not engage her enough .

In her last school she tended to only work enough to fulfill her assignments . Now she works to her ABILITY . It has been a challenge to balance the many projects she may have at any one time but , whereas I used to have to sit on her to finish projects on time , she is now eager to get on top of her work so that it will be done before it is due .
