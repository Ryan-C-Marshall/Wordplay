@@87520292 @3020292/ <h> 5 Key Strategies for Handling Conflict <p> Few enjoy being tasked with resolving conflict and often overlook the opportunity to grow through conflict . Conflict is typically seen as something to be avoided . This is because people seldom acknowledge that conflict is actually useful and can be handled successfully . Conflict can be used as a driving force . Virtually every significant advance of humanity has been the result of conflict . The more aggressive the conflict , the more dynamic the advancements . Even if there is no tangible foe , humanity needs to be under pressure ; we need to have a deadline . In the world of business , a healthy amount of conflict inspires us to meet our goals . If the threat of failure in the workplace is never apparent , we tend to achieve much less . Here are some strategies you can use : <h> Five Key Strategies for Handling Conflict : <p> Actively listen rather than simply react to what is being said . It is helpful to rephrase what the other person says to show an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive feedback and minimizes interruptions . Both parties need to feel heard before conflict can be resolved . <p> Use " I " statements to describe the events to avoid using accusatory language . Doing this creates a much clearer picture rather than an explanation of what someone did or did not do . While the speech may seem stilted , it will clarify your point of view in a straightforward manner to avoid overly critical remarks . For example , rather than say " You forgot to hand me the invoice numbers yesterday and now I 'm behind " , use " I " statements : " I noticed I did not receive the invoice numbers yesterday and I 'm not able to complete my work without them " . <p> Separate ego and vanity from authority and responsibility ; people utilize tactical positions to protect their status . Focus on common interests and avoid acknowledging individual positions . You are creating consensus and removing tension . <p> An objective viewpoint is necessary for a lasting resolution . Utilizing a mediator is helpful . Create options where everybody benefits . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that transpired remain unclear , ask each party " What would I have seen if I were in the room ? " This puts some mental distance between the complainant and the event . In trying to describe it to you , from your point of view , they should realize what was really driving the conflict . <p> These key strategies will promote teamwork in the face of disagreement . Raising self-awareness , finding objectivity , and communicating with open-mindedness are important strategies to adopt . Using these communication skills will build confidence and strengthen relationships so that employees can confidently and respectfully express their opinions without being blamed or ridiculed . Bring your team together and ultimately advance your company by handling conflict with these key strategies . <p> Want to learn more about Conflict Resolution ? KnowledgeCity can help you become an expert communicator . Our training will provide you with the skillset to work through conflict with the knowledge of different communication styles in the workplace . Learn to identify communication barriers and successfully create solutions for the betterment of your team .

With such a significant chunk of time spent away from the comforts of home , work should be a place that complements the rest of an employees life . Unfortunately , the office is not always the positive work environment that leads to creativity and success like it should be . <h> Workplace Problems <p> Many aspects of a work environment create disgruntled employees . A lack of direction from upper management , minimal fun engagement opportunities with coworkers , and no real loyalty or support make for a less-than-positive work environment . Consequently , these issues can result in high employee turnover rates . <p> Employees commonly leave jobs for these reasons , along with constant micromanagement and lack of valuable benefits programs . With so many potential issues , companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture quality employees . <h> How to Improve Work Environment for Employees <p> Luckily there are many things employers can do to create a positive work environment . By promoting a place where workers can grow both individually and as a team , loyalty for the company will grow as well . Below are some traits of positive work environments that boost employee morale . <h> 1 . A Listening Ear <p> Employee input provides valuable insight to issues employers may overlook . By listening to employee comments and thoughts , a company can foster an " active and committed employee base " as well as open the door to new profit-producing ideas . <h> 3 . Team-Building Events <p> Arranging social events not only provides some fun in the workweek , it also nurtures department collaboration . People tend to view their department as a " tribe , " which can lead to conflicts and unnecessary tension . Breaking down those invisible walls and promoting a positive work environment leads to new ideas that benefit the company overall . <h> 4 . Healthy Work-Life Balance <p> Stress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee health has rapidly declined . As we gain more information about the correlation between job stress and heart attacks , its become clear that there is a connection between stress and overall health . With this information in mind , employees now seek a positive work environment where their healthboth mental and physicalare properly valued . <p> Employers seeking to retain valuable employees can look into offering more services that better address a proper work-life balance . While most assume this means giving your employees more PTO , there are far more ways to encourage a healthy balance between professional and personal lives . <p> One of the best ways to nurture the mental and physical health of your employees is to offer some sort of employee wellness program . These programs often consist of corporate gym memberships and not only promote a healthy lifestyle , but can also lead to your employees being more present and productive at work as well . To top things off , businesses that offer gym memberships can deduct the costs of membership fees paid to benefit their employees . <h> Doing Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable and easily lost . Treating employees with respect for who they are and encouraging work-life balance , benefits the company as well as the individual . Remember , you are asking your team members to spend a significant amount of time on your companys goals . This is time they can not spend with family , friends , or doing what pleases them . Find a good balance and you will have less turnover , a better reputation , and a bigger bottom line .

According to Mike Kappel , CEO of Patriot Software , employers need to stop focusing on finding the " perfect " candidate . Instead , he suggests dividing up key employee traits into " must-have " and " like-to-have " categories . The challenging part of the matter then becomes understanding which job skills fall into the " must-have " category and which do n't  . <h> Why the Hiring Process Matters <p> The average cost-per-hire can reach well over $4,000 , according to the Society for Human Resource Management . With costs like these , identifying employees that possess the right job skills for your organization has never been more important . If you 've made mistakes in the recruitment process before , you are not alone . One notable example comes from Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh , who estimates bad hires have cost the online shoe and clothing company well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look for in Your Candidates <p> Industry and position-specific skills will obviously be of varying priority for employers .

Communication Skills <p> When most employers begin formulating a list of skills and qualities they want , many instinctively jot down communication skills . Unfortunately , many managers do this without stopping to think what communication truly means in the context of the workplace . While its true that communication skills often land at or near the top of many managers job skills lists , understanding what communication is in relation to the workplace is vital . <p> Workplace communication consists of far more than simply speaking with people and relaying information .

Tech Savvy Job Skills <p> In years past , being " familiar " or even " proficient " in a few basic computer skills was enough to get by . In todays corporate world , however , the top talent all tend to be completely fluent when it comes to understanding technology . What 's most noteworthy about this trend lies in the fact that it appears to be true , regardless of industry . <p> Locating candidates that understand technology not only ensures your organization immediate success but a higher likelihood of future success as well . Finding tech-savvy employees that share your goals puts your organization in a position to continue moving forward . <h> 3 . Organization <p> Along with the aforementioned communication skills , organizational skills often finds itself onto many job skills lists employers seek .

Problem Solving <p> According to a recent survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers ( NACE ) , over 70 percent of employers cite problem-solving abilities as a desirable trait for employees to possess . Regardless of the issue , employees that possess the job skills to solve problems can quickly and effectively reach logical conclusions . This helps to save managers time and helps the entire operation function more efficiently . <p> No matter what kind of job you 're looking to fill , there will inevitably be some obstacle that requires conquering . Recognizing candidates that understand the process of solving these problems safeguards your team from needing to pick up the slack somewhere down the road . <h> 5 .

While most assume this means giving your employees more PTO , there are far more ways to encourage a healthy balance between professional and personal lives . <p> One of the best ways to nurture the mental and physical health of your employees is to offer some sort of employee wellness program . These programs often consist of corporate gym memberships and not only promote a healthy lifestyle , but can also lead to your employees being more present and productive at work as well . To top things off , businesses that offer gym memberships can deduct the costs of membership fees paid to benefit their employees . <h> Doing Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable and easily lost .

According to Mike Kappel , CEO of Patriot Software , employers need to stop focusing on finding the " perfect " candidate .

When you are in a position to give informal , periodic feedback or a formal performance review to an employee or direct report , keeping the conversation supportive and constructive is an essential skill .

Understand the Ideal Praise to Criticism Ratio and Start On a Positive Note <p> Studies of the ideal praise to criticism ratio show that teams with top performance give out over five positive comments for every critical one .

Review Previous Expectations <p> Hopefully , you made professional expectations for this individual abundantly clear in the past . Setting expectations effectively can be accomplished by being clear about performance goals and dates early on . Setting up a clear authority hierarchy and reporting process provides adequate resources to your team and avoids micromanagement . Reviewing their responsibilities and what you have been evaluating in their work adds clarity and structure to a performance review or feedback conversation . Covering what needs to be discussed before early helps you avoid misunderstandings and vague , unfocused conversations . If you have written copies of previous or current performance reviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're starting on common ground . <h> 3 . Give Actionable Feedback <p> Being specific with your feedback can save both you and your direct report a lot of frustration down the road . When giving feedback , be specific and sincere . Tell them specifically what youd like to see them accomplish within a set time frame . Better yet , let them know how and when you will be evaluating their response to your request . Focus on their work , not their personality traits ; for example , instead of telling them they are generally long winded , request a more concise presentation . Again , be specific in your advice . Ask for one to two consolidated points per topic instead of five in their next presentation . <h> 4 . Practice Active Listening <p> Its important that you let your direct report have some time to share and respond . Find out if they have understood your expectations and feedback . This is also a great time to ask about their professional hopes and how they feel their current work does or does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Delivering an Effective Performance Review , Rebecca Knight writes , " Understanding what your direct reports want from their careers will help you figure out ways to broaden their professional experiences . " When you hear that an employee desires additional training , networking , or collaboration opportunities at work , they are giving you actionable feedback . <h> 5 . End on a Positive Note <p> Closing the employee feedback process with positive notes sets them up for future success . This process is sometimes known as the sandwich effect or PIP ( **29;0;TOOLONG ) . This reminds the employee that you see the efforts they are making at work and appreciate where they are excelling . It also builds an atmosphere of respect going forward . As well as reviewing what is working , express your confidence that they can make the improvements youve requested .

Recognizing and preparing for them in advance can help you reduce your stress and feel at ease in the new role . To help you feel better prepared for your new gig , we decided to help you navigate the Top 5 Challenges of Starting a New Job . <h> Top 5 Challenges of Starting a New Job <h> 1 . Making a Successful First Impression <p> Anna Marie Russel , a program coordinator with AmeriCorps , writes that " the early days are when your boss and colleagues form the most lasting impressions about you . " In your first week , trying to look the part while learning as much as possible can be a struggle , but how you handle those challenges will set the tone for your workplace reputation . <h> What to do : <p> Feeling good is just as important as looking good on the first day . A solid nights rest and a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready to make connections . Other simple steps include researching to get to know more about your company and arriving early on the first day . <h> 2 . Adjusting to the Learning Curve <p> Learning new tools and methods can look like a very steep uphill battle , especially when entering a new field . Stress is expected , but so are setbacks and surprises . Some companies understand that most employees will encounter this at some point , and can provide training , meetings , and even coaching . But when those avenues are n't  enough , simple methods exist to ease the burden . <h> What to do : <p> Remember that the learning curve is temporary , and give yourself some months to adjust . For now , focus on what you can control . You have full control over whether or not you are going to ask for help . If you 're afraid of looking weak , the truth is seeking your coworkers advice is often the best way to build relationships and show them that you care about their insight . Just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for their help . Here are some dos and donts to strategically ask for help . <h> 3 . Information Overload <p> Its natural . Youve memorized the schedule , the common procedures , and even some of your coworkers namesbut then the job starts , and a new rush of information unfurls . Information overload is also known by Workplace Psychology as IFS , or Information Fatigue Syndrome . Very prominent in new employees , its symptoms can include loss of concentration , reduced productivity , and even a weakened immune system . <h> What to do : <p> To reduce these stressors , it helps to set priorities ; focus on information that is relative and important , and accomplish tasks one at a time . An easy way to do this is with the ABCs of Organization method . These measures can simplify big challenges into manageable tasks , reducing the amount of stress involved in transitioning into a new role . <h> 4 . Trouble Acclimating <p> A new position comes with all of the stressors of having new coworkers , job responsibilities , expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find yourself ruminating over job performance and social interactions with officemates . But before pulling your hair out and asking " What have I done ? " , consider the following steps . <h> What to do : <p> Acclimating to a new role can take anyone out of their comfort zone . But when it happens , its important to remind yourself that this is part of the transition . An effective way to refocus your thoughts is through gratitude exercises . Take a break to think or write to yourself the favorable things that have happened since this transition . In reminding yourself that you are actually in a good place , you train yourself to think of brighter possibilities instead of the intimidating " what ifs " . This shift in perspective will give you a sense of determination by the time you are ready to work again . <h> 5 . Waning Confidence <p> It can be difficult to feel confident as the newbie . You do n't  know anyone . Youve made mistakes during training and what if you 're just not good enough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative self-talk . If you 're not careful , you 'll start to wholeheartedly believe your inner critic , wondering how you were even hired in the first place . <h> What to do : <p> When you feel your confidence slipping , get into the habit of using words of affirmation . Create your own version of this list to repeat to yourself on days when that inner critic is too loud . Keeping a balanced , healthy perspective of yourself is the key to feeling more confident at work . While repeating mantras to yourself does not work like magic , the act of diminishing negative self-talk each day can make all the difference in how you view yourself and your success in the new position . Confidence in the workplace can make every day at work productive and invigorating , and leave a lasting impression on coworkers and management .

@@87520354 @3020354/ <h> 10 Most Effective Communication Techniques for Business <p> Effective communication in the workplace leads to positive workflow and accelerated production . It enables clear direction , a concept where each member of a business team knows exactly what is expected of them at all times . Businesses small and large benefit with a better end product and higher profits when they are enlisting these 10 communication techniques in their business practices : <h> 10 Techniques for Effective Communication <h> 1 . Get to the Point <p> An employee is motivated more effectively with a quick five-minute conversation then they are with a three-hour lecture . Be concise in your communications , when you start to over talk your point your audience will just tune you out . <h> 2 . Plan Ahead <p> Whether it is a large meeting or a one-on-one chat , make sure you are organized before talking with your employees . You will quickly lose their focus if you are fumbling through notes to find important facts . <h> 3 . Be Specific When Providing Feedback <p> Take mental ( or physical , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then use those to provide specific feedback . " You 're doing a great job ! " is a nice pat on the back , but " I really appreciate you coming in early yesterday to complete that project " shows a greater depth of acknowledgment for a job well done . <h> 4 . Follow a 3:1 ratio <p> Not all feedback is going to be positive of course , but negative feedback is better received when it is accompanied by good points as well . For every one thing wrong that you need to point out to an employee , make sure that you are also mentioning three things that they did right . This type of deliberate sugar coating makes them strive to have all of their work activities on your " good " list . <h> 5 . Always Have Honorable Intentions <p> Employees will see right through a communication that is meant to manipulate or mislead them . Effective communication in business has to be built on a foundation of trust , where it is apparent that the business and its employees best interests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consistent With Your Communication <p> Nothing will break down clear direction in the workplace faster than inconsistency with your messages . If you do need to make a change in policy or try a different business strategy , make sure you are clear with the changes and offer an explanation for why they were made . <h> 7 . Consider How to Relay Certain Communications <p> There are circumstances where an email or text message is an appropriate way to contact an employee . In contrast , there are also times when its best to meet face to face with your employee . Think about the way you would want your superiors to relay a similar message to you and then follow that lead . <h> 8 . Always Invite Feedback <p> Business communication is only effective if it is understood by the recipient . Watch for signs of confusion and invite your employees to ask questions . Understandably , an employee may be embarrassed to admit when they do n't  get your point , so its up to you to ensure that they did . Asking them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge how much of it was clear to them . <h> 9 . Do n't  Put Off Difficult Discussions <p> You cant afford to avoid a conversation with an employee for any reason . Problematic situations will only get worse the longer you wait to address them . When dealing with a conflict , be respectful and kind but hold your ground and do n't  allow for the conversation to be put off until a later date . <h> 10 . Be a Perfect Listener <p> This is probably the best advice a person in power can get when learning techniques for effective communication . If you are dismissive when an employee comes to you with an idea , concern , or for guidance , expect to get the same from them when it is your turn to talk . <h> Learning Successful Communication <p> Successful business leaders know the importance of effective communication . More so , they make a point to practice techniques that reinforce that in the workplace .

In the world of business , its the little things that add up , and that might not be a good thing . Everyone has little quirks and habits that they bring into the office every single day , but are those habits nixing all hope for higher productivity ? <p> These habits might seem quite simple , and they might appear to take up only a moment here and a second there but they really do add up to something much more . Look through this checklist and make note of the potential self-sabotage . <h> Time Wasting Habits Checklist <h> Jumping at phone notifications <p> Phones are a ubiquitous tool , and a good one at that . Staying connected at all times has become the norm , however , all those notifications create a great deal of noise that scatters the attention of even the most dedicated worker . From the work emails that pop up , to the reminder phone call from the dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in agesconstantly looking at that little blinking notification light creates a sense of urgency a desire to check it right now , because who knows ? It could be something important ! <p> Even though a simple glance at a mobile device seems innocent , it is actually a sneaky introduction to multitasking overload . Not only does multi-tasking lead to lower productivity , it can actually lead to something even worse : an experiment by the University of London found that a persons average IQ actually drops when they allow distractions from things like phone and email . <p> So tuck that phone away in a drawer , and check it only during lunch . The immediate jump in productivity might be a very welcome surprise . <h> Glancing at email <p> Though email is a tool very few can live without , it really is proof that anyone can have too much of a good thing . Most workers are quite conscientious about answering emails promptly ; a 2013 study by GFI Software found that 32% of workers reply to emails within 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's great or is it ? Just as with checking the phone , glancing at email undermines focus , and it takes several long minutes to get back on track . Doing this several times each hour , and attempting to concentrate quickly becomes a fools errand . <p> Take back control of productivity by checking emails only a few times per day or if it must be more often , only once per hour . <h> Putting out the welcome mat <p> Interruptions are going to happen during the workday , but keeping the office door open invites colleagues to stop and chat , which can lead to extreme disruptions of productivity . According to Steelcase , workers deal with interruptions every 11 minutes , on average and it takes a whopping 23 minutes to return to full focus on a task . When interruptions become a way of life , productivity takes a serious hit . <p> There are several ways to avoid this . Those who work in an office with a door can cut distractions by closing and locking it . Place a note on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , adhering to the suggestions about email and phone can help eliminate distractions from the outside world . <h> Sweating the details <p> Trying to perfect that project , memo or even a simple email can lead to second-guessing , which then leads to rewrites , and then more stress about those . The process can turn into a never-ending cycle , and eventually , perfection looks much more like procrastination . <p> Though some things do deserve extra attention , such as that email to the CEO or that very important grant request , most of a persons day-to-day work wont be showing up in a professional journal . So its a good idea to give everything a quick proofread , hit send and move on to the next task . <h> Not getting enough rest <p> I know , this does n't  make much sense .

With such a significant chunk of time spent away from the comforts of home , work should be a place that complements the rest of an employees life . Unfortunately , the office is not always the positive work environment that leads to creativity and success like it should be . <h> Workplace Problems <p> Many aspects of a work environment create disgruntled employees . A lack of direction from upper management , minimal fun engagement opportunities with coworkers , and no real loyalty or support make for a less-than-positive work environment . Consequently , these issues can result in high employee turnover rates . <p> Employees commonly leave jobs for these reasons , along with constant micromanagement and lack of valuable benefits programs . With so many potential issues , companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture quality employees . <h> How to Improve Work Environment for Employees <p> Luckily there are many things employers can do to create a positive work environment . By promoting a place where workers can grow both individually and as a team , loyalty for the company will grow as well . Below are some traits of positive work environments that boost employee morale . <h> 1 . A Listening Ear <p> Employee input provides valuable insight to issues employers may overlook . By listening to employee comments and thoughts , a company can foster an " active and committed employee base " as well as open the door to new profit-producing ideas . <h> 3 . Team-Building Events <p> Arranging social events not only provides some fun in the workweek , it also nurtures department collaboration . People tend to view their department as a " tribe , " which can lead to conflicts and unnecessary tension . Breaking down those invisible walls and promoting a positive work environment leads to new ideas that benefit the company overall . <h> 4 . Healthy Work-Life Balance <p> Stress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee health has rapidly declined . As we gain more information about the correlation between job stress and heart attacks , its become clear that there is a connection between stress and overall health . With this information in mind , employees now seek a positive work environment where their healthboth mental and physicalare properly valued . <p> Employers seeking to retain valuable employees can look into offering more services that better address a proper work-life balance . While most assume this means giving your employees more PTO , there are far more ways to encourage a healthy balance between professional and personal lives . <p> One of the best ways to nurture the mental and physical health of your employees is to offer some sort of employee wellness program . These programs often consist of corporate gym memberships and not only promote a healthy lifestyle , but can also lead to your employees being more present and productive at work as well . To top things off , businesses that offer gym memberships can deduct the costs of membership fees paid to benefit their employees . <h> Doing Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable and easily lost .

Find a good balance and you will have less turnover , a better reputation , and a bigger bottom line .

Between hourly wages , salaried pay , and everything in between , understanding which to offer your employees can quickly become difficult . <p> here 's a breakdown of the pros and cons of the different kinds of compensation structures commonly used . <h> Pros &amp; Cons of Employee Compensation Types <h> Hourly Wage <h> Pros : <p> Paying by the hour remains the ideal method when a set number of hours is expected for project completion . This gives you flexibility because as a manager you can decide on how many hours you can pay for based on your budget . <h> Cons : <p> The main disadvantage is that you will have to pay extra for overtime or for work on holidays . Costs are one and a half times the base hourly rate if you require your employees to work overtime and up to twice of that on a holiday . <h> Salary <h> Pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you would not have to pay for overtime work . Employees will have to finish projects regardless of the time it requires within the budget that you have set aside for their salary . Your employees might also be happier , as they are not as likely to associate happiness with income . For example , those paid by the hour may experience a dip in satisfaction levels if they work fewer hours and thus earn less . <h> Cons : <p> You will have to offer extra perks to make the salary and position more appealing , such as health insurance , benefits , and flexible working hours . This will require more planning as a manager , but may also result in your employees being happier overall . <h> Bonus <h> Pros : <p> Paying a bonus incentivizes employees and teams to produce exceptional results . For example , if a team performs well as a whole , this raises the amount of the bonus that everyone will receive . Bonuses will also encourage employee loyalty , as this structure often has a large salary component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career at the company . <h> Cons : <p> It might be difficult to determine who should receive a bonus if team effort produced the results . Also , employees might take bonuses for granted and have expectations to receive one even if profits for the year do not warrant it . <h> Commission <h> Pros : <p> Paying a commission tends to motivate salespeople to produce more sales for the company , especially if the commission rate is attractive . If the commission structure is well designed , it should work well without impacting your company profits . Individual effort is emphasized , requiring less supervision by sales management . <h> Cons : <p> Conversely , a low commission rate would not be attractive to an employee . This may also affect company loyalty as an employee would be more likely to leave for a higher commission rate . <p> Ultimately , deciding which structure to go with will depend on the complexity of the work required , as well as how much time it will take for the work to be completed . Other factors should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you require in managing your budget .

In fact , people often cringe at the mere thought of writing a " business report . " Granted , these are somewhat more complicated than business letters , but if approached in the right way , business report writing can be a straightforward and reasonably painless process . <h> 5 Steps for Better Business Report Writing <h> 1 . Confirm Client Expectations <p> This step may sound simple , but clarifying client expectations is essential to any successful business report . When determining this , always think specifically in terms of the final deliverable ( usually the final report ) . What issues must the report address ? What direction or guidance does the business report give ? Do you know the customers expected bottom line ? <h> 2 . Determine What Type of Report the Client Requires <p> There are a number of different types of business reports . Although there is usually some overlap between the different types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . For example , does the client want a : <p> Business plan <p> Business proposal <p> Strategic plan <p> Corporate information management plan <p> Strategic business plan <p> Marketing plan <p> Financial plan <p> Possessing a clear understanding of the expectations of the report from the outset makes the entire business report writing process far simpler and straightforward . <h> 3 . Conduct Research <p> Once you know exactly what the client wants , and the specific type of report they are looking for , you stand ready to conduct your research . This stage may be as simple as collecting and reading a few background documents supplied by the client or it could involve developing questionnaires and conducting detailed interviews . You may find as you develop the report that you require additional research in order to continue . <p> The internet , of course , can simplify and shorten the research process , but do n't  forget to always verify your sources . A business report delivers facts to the reader and the only way to validate your claims lies with thoroughly conducted research . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Table of Contents ( TOC ) , is the single most important element of developing a successful business report . This document can normally be done before , or in parallel with , the first phase of project information gathering . It represents a carefully thought out breakdown of exactly what you imagine the final report will look like and serves as an outline for you as you write . <p> Create a skeleton document first by entering the entire Table of Contents , heading by heading before you begin to write any of the text . At this point , the document is essentially a sequential series of headings and sub-headings with blank space between them . The TOC then becomes a step-by-step template for the rest of the process . You 're now ready to start filling in the blank spaces after each heading and sub-heading in the body of the document with text . <h> 5 . Write for Your Audience <p> A style of writing designed for a specific audience remains one of the hallmarks of a well-written business report regardless of the type of report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports should play a vital role in how it is you write them . Will these reports only be circulated internally or will they be sent out to people outside of your industry ? <p> If your reports will be circulated externally , for example , it would be in your best interest to avoid industry jargon and overly complex terminology . Remember , the point of a business report is to deliver information clearly and concisely . Identify what " clear and concise " means for your readers and write to that effect . <h> Further Writing Improvements <p> Improving your business writing skills does n't  need to stop here .

If you think of a few of the brands you know and love , this is probably true for you as well . Successful branding incorporates your companys values into every aspect of your customer-facing copy . So how do you create that strong , successful branding ? Here are four characteristics of successful branding that will leave your competitors in the dust . <h> 4 Tips for Successful Branding <h> Do Your Homework <p> One of the most important parts of creating a successful brand is the research that goes into it . Setting aside time to research and answer three key questions about your company will help you create a successful brand . <h> Who is your target market ? <p> Study the customers you want to attract . If possible , put yourself in their shoes . What are their hopes , dreams , fears , and worries ? What keeps them up at night ? Perhaps more importantly , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your company can solve ? Find out as much as you can about your target audience , and you will know how to tailor your branding to attract them . <h> Who are your competitors ? <p> Build a list of competitors in your field and spend time researching them , finding out what is working for them and what tactics they use that flop . When you learn about the competition , you gain more knowledge in your marketplace and can use their consumer research to boost your own . <h> How does your company do it better ? <p> You must learn what your competitors do so you can also learn what they do not do . This is where the key to your branding lies . Even the most dominant brands have holes in their service . These gaps leave the door open for businesses like yours to come in and satisfy the needs your competitors are n't  . <p> For example , say your company creates affordable computers . After researching the market and identifying your nearest competitors , you notice their customer service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer service , you are more likely to pick up the customers who are unsatisfied by your competitors . <h> Build Your Voice <p> Now that you have built up a solid research base , it is time to leverage this knowledge with action . Start by reading over your target audience information again . What kind of language do they use in their everyday life ? <p> In order to reach your target audience , you need to use relevant language that gets them to remember and trust your brand . As such , your customers vocabulary largely decides your own . You would n't use technical language to sell phones to teenagers , and you would n't tell a CEO their trade portfolio is going to be " rad " after using your services . <p> In our example , the target audience for your affordable computers may not care to know the exact specifications of every component in the computer ; they may simply be interested in the computers highlights . Instead of detailing every aspect of your product , simply highlight the benefits : a strong processor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your companys voice around the vocabulary your customer is comfortable with helps hone in on your target audience . <h> Keep it Consistent <p> Once you have your voice set- never stray from it . No matter if your customer is engaging with your website , social media accounts , or email newsletter , it is very important that they are engaging with the same brand . If you use different language on your website than you do in your email campaigns , you are not delivering a consistent voice to your readers . <p> Using our example , take a look at what your competitors are doing . Do they use the same branding across all channels ? Is their vocabulary simple , and tailored to their customers ? Are the logo and cover photos on their social media accounts consistent with their website and color scheme ? . Seamless consistency such as this is important to successful branding . <h> Use Content Marketing <p> Content marketing is a must nowadays . This is because content marketing is the best way to build trust and establish your brand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , it is exactly what it sounds like : using content like blogs and articles to market your site and services . By creating relevant content , you further leverage your knowledge of the industry and set yourself up as a professional voice in your field . <p> Writing content on a consistent basis not only has the benefit of building customer loyalty- it also attracts new prospects . People who read your articles are already looking for services like yours . They are more likely to use your services once theyve found your answers to be helpful to their questions . <p> Standing out in the modern era can be a challenge . Using these tips to help you create a powerful brand will put you ahead of the competition , and bring you one step closer to success .

Work-life balance is the amount of time spent at work and the quantity of time spent engaged in non-work activities . Work-life balance requires being balanced both mentally and physically . Its critical for increasing productivity . Emotionally and physically balanced employees can produce better results for the employer , and the team they work with . <p> Weve researched the most effective ways to achieve a better work-life balance and brought them here for you . Add these 6 Helpful Tips to your daily routine now and start finding that perfect balance you 've been looking for . <h> 6 Tips to Achieve Better Balance in Life <h> 1 . Search for a Flexible Employer <p> Remember that it may be your job causing this feeling of unbalance . Job flexibility is one of the most desired corporate benefit among many employees today .

Whether its flex-time , job sharing , or a shorter work week , try asking for it .

Realize a Temporary Lack of Balance is Acceptable <p> It may feel like life is temporarily out of balance from time to time . Sometimes its worth it , like when someone decides to go back to school or take the time to care for a child or parent .

The signs of burnout will vary from person to person , but include : <p> Fatigue <p> Lack of motivation <p> Low job performance <p> Negativity <p> Poor self-care <p> Health problems <p> Difficulties with relationships <p> Refresh and relax ! Something as simple as taking a weekend vacation could be the perfect remedy or maybe something major is in order , like a change in careers .

Provide thorough research for your claims during meetings to convince your company why everyone needs to be on board . For example , point out that salary levels may drop or competitors may be climbing the charts unless a change is made now .

Make sure this announcement is face-to-face so that you can directly answer any concerns and questions . <h> 2 . A Brighter Future <p> Help your company envision a brighter future by describing how this change will lead to security in the long term . Conjure specific examples for how the change will affect each employees day-to-day work life and celebrate all they have done for the company in the past . These steps will make your team feel valued for their hard work and excited to buy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to show your employees that the change is well thought out with their best interests in mind . <h> 3 . Participation Plans <p> Identify the positive influencers of your business , such as role models and managers who are on board with the change . Have the key influencers create a participation plan to promote a buy-in mentality for the rest of your staff . The plan should include the level of input required by different groups of employees , such as what departments will be in charge of budgets , logistics , decision-making , etc . Participation plans will break down how each employee will contribute and in turn should eliminate ambiguity employees may be experiencing about the change . Do not forget to identify key influencers who are skeptical and reluctant to change . Have an open door policy for them to discuss their fears and insecurities .

@@87520428 @3020428/ <h> Improve Your Multitasking Skills in Four Simple Steps <p> As technology advances , it creates numerous avenues for getting things done . Were working on multiple projects and performing various tasks all at the same timebut what are the results ? How much attention are we giving to each of our tasks ? Are we really being that productive ? According to a study on distracted drivers , multitasking is a myth , it was revealed that the brain does not perform two or more tasks at oncesomething we like to believe it can do when we multitask . Instead , the brain actually performs these multiple tasks very quickly in a sequential order . This " attention switching " gives us the false feeling of doing more in less time . <p> The trick to multitasking is to give yourself enough time to focus on one thing rather than believing you are doing two things at the same time . Here are some simple steps that you can follow daily in order to improve your multitasking skills and successfully complete multiple projects by their deadlines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flow <p> Avoid worrying about the assignments you wont be able to finish and map out a timeline . Plan ahead to organize your tasks in a logical order either by difficulty , deadline , or priority . While foresight will give you a better idea of where to put your focus throughout the workday , do n't  let it be set in stone . A manager or colleague may ask you to switch gears for a moment . Rather than let this distract you , readjust your timeline accordingly without overlooking your main priorities . <p> Step 2 : Be Realistic <p> It would be ideal if we could diligently complete all our projects in one day , but sometimes this just is n't realistic . In reality , rather than doing two things at once , we are switching our attention on and off from one task to another . While the brain attempts to juggle multiple assignments , it must also juggle the focus and attention to each task ; this results in a reaction time or delay . These delays may be a few tenths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , but they do add up . To avoid such delays , be honest about what you cant do and give yourself ample time to focus on one thing at a time before moving on . <p> Step 3 : Avoid Distractions <p> Handling multiple tasks is a distracting feat on its own . Its important to understand your company policy and make adjustments to limit distractions throughout your day . Focus on what you can control in your workspace . We cant always avoid coworkers trying to reach us , but we can request time alone to focus on an assignment . We cant always ignore clients in need of service , but we may be able to schedule a period of our day to handle phone calls and emails . Turning off your phone , minimizing your email window , or simply closing your door can improve concentration and , in turn , better your chances at finishing your to-dos . <p> Step 4 : Delegate or Ask for Help <p> Knowing where you can use an extra hand is a great way to cut time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , writing content , uploading content , filing , etc . Which of these activities are simple enough for you to assign to someone else ? Which of them require your expertise ? For instance , you may be able to hand filing duties to an intern , but are unable to delegate writing content because you are the only expert on the subject . This step will play a huge role in decreasing stress and increasing productivity . <p> Working on multiple projects and tasks does not mean you have to do them at the same time . Planning ahead , understanding each project , and giving yourself time are all keys to reaching deadlines .

Yet , this is still an area that professionals struggle with their productivity during the day . Failure at time management will result in spending the day bouncing from project to project , without ever actually accomplishing a goal . Instead of investing in yet another day planner that will never be opened , try following these steps to better manage your time : <p> 1 . Wake Up Early If you start your work day rushing through your morning to get to work on time , chances are the rest of the day will follow suit . Get out of bed at least a half hour earlier than necessary and leisure through your morning routine . Use this time to begin mentally planning for the day . Write down the goals you have to accomplish and the steps needed to meet them . Starting each day off with a clear relaxed mind will work wonders at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down Time Wisely If you use car pooling or mass transit to get to the office , use that time to go over daily appointments and pending meetings .

Prioritize Make sure to follow an order of importance when planning your daily workload and set time limits on how long you are going to spend on each project or activity . Work out your schedule to complete tasks daily , rather than having deadlines hanging over you for multiple projects . You will focus better on the job at hand if you know that other tasks have been accomplished successfully . <p> 4 .

Always plan ahead and have all of your important documents organized to make finding them easier . Better yet , delegate this task to one of your employees while you work on your other priorities . <p> 6 . Make Time for Yourself Learning how to manage your time is not only a business priority . Successful men and women have a good balance between their professional and personal lives . If you are able to manage your work day more constructively , you will feel better about relaxing when it ends .

They 're trying to go beyond the interview facade and clarify what it would really be like to work with you so that they can make a smart hiring decision . <h> Tip : <p> As uncomfortable as it is to talk about your flaws , one of the keys to interview success is to be honest . Give them an honest flaw along with a resolution plan that shows initiative to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not ruin your chances in the running . <h> Weak Answer : <p> " My greatest weakness is that I am a perfectionist who is never satisfied with the finished product .

However , I am working to improve my public speaking skills by partaking in group presentations at work events . For the past year Ive spoken at three conferences and improved each time . " <p> A strong answer is not only honest , but believable , and shows you are motivated to change .

Brainstorm positive traits that you 've demonstrated in past jobs .

I am confident I will be a great asset as secretary to this business .

@@87520440 @3020440/ <h> Improve Your Multitasking Skills in Four Simple Steps <p> As technology advances , it creates numerous avenues for getting things done . Were working on multiple projects and performing various tasks all at the same timebut what are the results ? How much attention are we giving to each of our tasks ? Are we really being that productive ? According to a study on distracted drivers , multitasking is a myth , it was revealed that the brain does not perform two or more tasks at oncesomething we like to believe it can do when we multitask . Instead , the brain actually performs these multiple tasks very quickly in a sequential order . This " attention switching " gives us the false feeling of doing more in less time . <p> The trick to multitasking is to give yourself enough time to focus on one thing rather than believing you are doing two things at the same time . Here are some simple steps that you can follow daily in order to improve your multitasking skills and successfully complete multiple projects by their deadlines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flow <p> Avoid worrying about the assignments you wont be able to finish and map out a timeline . Plan ahead to organize your tasks in a logical order either by difficulty , deadline , or priority . While foresight will give you a better idea of where to put your focus throughout the workday , do n't  let it be set in stone . A manager or colleague may ask you to switch gears for a moment . Rather than let this distract you , readjust your timeline accordingly without overlooking your main priorities . <p> Step 2 : Be Realistic <p> It would be ideal if we could diligently complete all our projects in one day , but sometimes this just is n't realistic . In reality , rather than doing two things at once , we are switching our attention on and off from one task to another . While the brain attempts to juggle multiple assignments , it must also juggle the focus and attention to each task ; this results in a reaction time or delay . These delays may be a few tenths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , but they do add up . To avoid such delays , be honest about what you cant do and give yourself ample time to focus on one thing at a time before moving on . <p> Step 3 : Avoid Distractions <p> Handling multiple tasks is a distracting feat on its own . Its important to understand your company policy and make adjustments to limit distractions throughout your day . Focus on what you can control in your workspace . We cant always avoid coworkers trying to reach us , but we can request time alone to focus on an assignment . We cant always ignore clients in need of service , but we may be able to schedule a period of our day to handle phone calls and emails . Turning off your phone , minimizing your email window , or simply closing your door can improve concentration and , in turn , better your chances at finishing your to-dos . <p> Step 4 : Delegate or Ask for Help <p> Knowing where you can use an extra hand is a great way to cut time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , writing content , uploading content , filing , etc . Which of these activities are simple enough for you to assign to someone else ? Which of them require your expertise ? For instance , you may be able to hand filing duties to an intern , but are unable to delegate writing content because you are the only expert on the subject . This step will play a huge role in decreasing stress and increasing productivity . <p> Working on multiple projects and tasks does not mean you have to do them at the same time . Planning ahead , understanding each project , and giving yourself time are all keys to reaching deadlines .

Yet , this is still an area that professionals struggle with their productivity during the day . Failure at time management will result in spending the day bouncing from project to project , without ever actually accomplishing a goal . Instead of investing in yet another day planner that will never be opened , try following these steps to better manage your time : <p> 1 . Wake Up Early If you start your work day rushing through your morning to get to work on time , chances are the rest of the day will follow suit . Get out of bed at least a half hour earlier than necessary and leisure through your morning routine . Use this time to begin mentally planning for the day . Write down the goals you have to accomplish and the steps needed to meet them . Starting each day off with a clear relaxed mind will work wonders at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down Time Wisely If you use car pooling or mass transit to get to the office , use that time to go over daily appointments and pending meetings .

Prioritize Make sure to follow an order of importance when planning your daily workload and set time limits on how long you are going to spend on each project or activity . Work out your schedule to complete tasks daily , rather than having deadlines hanging over you for multiple projects . You will focus better on the job at hand if you know that other tasks have been accomplished successfully . <p> 4 . Delegate One of the best , often unused , resources you have are your team members . Delegate whenever possible to other members of your team .

Organize Having to rummage through paperwork or look up information online at the last minute is a big time waster and it causes you to lose focus . Always plan ahead and have all of your important documents organized to make finding them easier . Better yet , delegate this task to one of your employees while you work on your other priorities . <p> 6 . Make Time for Yourself Learning how to manage your time is not only a business priority . Successful men and women have a good balance between their professional and personal lives . If you are able to manage your work day more constructively , you will feel better about relaxing when it ends .

It can feel like important tasks are slipping through the cracks and you cant keep track of all you have to do . Often times , all you need to do in order to address this situation is do a little bit of organizing . Here is an easy-to-use strategy that we call the " ABCs of Organization " that can help you prioritize your tasks . <h> The ABC Strategy <p> This strategy takes the to-do list approach one step further . Rather than create a never-ending list on a sheet of paper , the ABC Strategy declutters your list so that it begins to look more doable and less daunting . Write your tasks onto Post-Its with one task per sticky note , making it easier to move them around . Then categorize the tasks into three sections : A , B , and C. Note : it may help to use three different colors of Post-Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Category A <p> Place all the tasks that are absolutely critical in this first category . These are generally time-sensitive tasks that are crucial to being finished by the end of the day . Once you are finished categorizing section A , these items become your Top Priority list . Determining your Top Priority items quickly becomes crucial because it often dictates how you divide your time . <h> Category B <p> Place all the tasks that are important , but not as time-critical in this second category . Think of duties that have a definite deadline , but do not need to be completed particularly soon . These can be tasks that you want to get done by the end of the week , for instance . When you are finished listing tasks for section B , the category becomes your Mild Priority list . Having your Mild Priority items physically squared away will give you the preparedness and foresight to accomplish them in a timely manner without distracting you from the Top Priority items . <h> Category C <p> Place all the tasks that can be postponed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The visual indication of low-priority tasks will give you permission to procrastinate . Once your C list is completed , these tasks will then become a Do n't  Do list . By giving yourself permission to not do particular tasks , you can focus on the other items with less energy spent worrying about what still needs to be done . Once the more pressing tasks are taken care of , you can eventually move C items into the A and B sections . <h> A Versatile Organizational Strategy <p> Both your professional and personal lives can experience the benefits of this ABC Strategy .

@@87520464 @3020464/ <p> 80 percent of business owners take a reactive approach in their deals . The key business negotiation skills for winning these deals is to get on the other side of that line . This allows you to take control and set the tone before the negotiation ever begins . So , how can you negotiate like the elite ? These six tips will take you all the way to the finish line-you only need to implement them . <h> Top 6 Business Negotiation Skills You Need to Know <h> 1 . Prepare Yourself for the Win <p> Preparation is the key to proper negotiating . This is where game theory comes into play . What is the best possible outcome for you ? What is the best possible outcome for your opponent ? Write down the most favorable outcomes for you , and then decide what you are willing to give in order to achieve them . No matter your companys individualized tactics , starting from a cooperative base sets a positive tone for your negotiations . Find the middle ground which allows both of you to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> From there , factor in everyones favorite variable-uncertainty . Figure out the best alternatives to your negotiated agreement ( BATNA ) -acceptable alternatives should your main goal no longer be viable . Having plans A-Z can mean the difference between being in control of the meeting and backpedaling , trying to stay upright . <h> 2 . Do n't  Personalize Reactions <p> Does your jaw clench anytime someone downplays your product ? Maybe your breathing gets a bit shallower when someone just cant see your side of things ? Although you may be negotiating a deal on your company or your services , do not mistake these things for yourself . Remove your emotions from the discussion , and the negotiations are less likely to become hostile . In addition , by separating yourself from the deal , you can negotiate with a clear mind , and are more likely to notice and capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves . <h> 3 . Positional Bargaining- When to Stand Firm <p> One of the most simple , yet powerful business negotiation skills is to find the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on for this negotiation to be a success ? While it is always smart to focus on the best win-win solution for each party , at times that is not always possible . Whether due to personal interests or the many different involvements of two companies , negotiations can at times be a bit like splitting hairs . In these situations , it is beneficial to take a step back , remind yourself of the one thing you are there for , and focus on it . Getting the negotiations refocused on the issue just may save the deal . <h> 4 . The Power of Silence <p> Conversationally , we have been trained to believe silence is awkward . In a negotiation , doubly so . However , you may not realize that there is power in silence . In silence , you become a practitioner of the extraordinary art form known as listening . Present your side , and then be still . Pay attention to what the other person is saying . Also , pay attention to what they are not saying . Does their language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express their concerns , and then again , listen . <p> Everything that comes out of a persons mouth is directly related to their needs . If you can find a way to fulfill their needs , yours will undoubtedly be met . This is the art of successful negotiating . <h> 5 . Negotiating the Win-Win <p> As you 've prepared for the win , you have created your BATNA . Now it is time to bring those into the fray . Assessing your opponents best alternatives , as well as your own , can help you in finding target goals based on the changing needs of the negotiations . Knowing that the opponent will always accept the highest payoff , how can you make them win while also taking the pile for yourself ? Do not spend so much time accommodating the other sides needs that you forget to take your own into consideration . Successful negotiation is about reaching agreeable terms for both parties . <h> 6 . Learn to Walk Away <p> Having the option of saying " No , thanks " can mean the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have other options . Even if you do n't  have other options , tell yourself " I will walk away if I can not close a satisfactory deal " .

Many find themselves embarking on entrepreneurship , parenthood , civic involvement and full-time employment all at once . The you-can-have-it-all affirmation has turned into a must-do-it-all burden .

Luckily , re-engaging your workers just takes a few simple adjustments . Remember , what sets millennials apart most from other generations is their motivation for working .

Use these tips to create the strongest cover letter possible for your next job . <h> What Makes a Strong Cover Letter ? <h> Know Your Purpose <p> Think of your cover letter like a sales letter with a strong purpose : selling yourself .

No doubt , your resume is perfect ; littered with awards , certifications , achievements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your cover letter , on the other hand , is a great opportunity for a recruiter to get to know you . <p> Do n't  be afraid to step out of the robotic " professional " vernacular that plagues the average cover letter . Avoid the use of the generic sentences such as : <p> " Dear Mr. or Ms. Last Name , <p> I amand I am applying for theposition . " <p> Truthfully , the recruiter knows all of this information . Repeating it back to them is certain to make them bored before they can read all of the great reasons to hire you . <p> A great way to personalize your cover letter is to keep your writing style similar to the way you speak . If you do n't  use certain words in your regular speech , why write with them ? Your personality will impress the recruiter , not your vocabulary . Use this brief opportunity to convey your personal ambitions , the enthusiasm you have for what you do , and the creativity that fuels every aspect of your life . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be of benefit in the position you are applying for ; find a way to include that while still remaining personal . <p> " I was really excited to see that your training program is completed underwater . I recently received my scuba certification to keep myself active ; and am glad to know I will put that to good use in this position . " <p> While most corporate jobs will not include underwater training , the principle remains the same . Just as you find ways the position fits you ; you should find ways to express how your personality and skills are the best fit for the position . <h> Cover Your Strengths <p> When drafting your cover letter , consider strong points from your resume that you can highlight as benefits to the company . But be sure they are only highlights of your resume . From the recruiters perspective , the only thing worse than reading another resume is reading it twice . <p> It also helps to leave out the unnecessary details from your cover letter . For example , a recruiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or teams you have managed ; but will likely have no care for your ability to play guitar . There are many other ways to inject your amazing personality into your cover letter while still remaining professional . <p> This tip is pretty self-explanatory . A two page , single-spaced cover letter will be rapidly skimmed , or worse , skipped . Cut your cover letter down to a half a page , using full line breaks between small paragraphs . This makes your cover letter much more readable ; and as simple as it seems , readable letters get read . <h> Finish Strong <p> The recruiter wants to see that you are confident in your abilities to fulfill the job . Wrap up your letter by stating the number one reason the recruiter needs to call you in for an interview . Be assertive , but do n't  be obnoxious . " I 'm the best at " will likely not get you the interview , but , " I will help your company achieve " can make them remember you .

Introverts can run out of energy quickly when put in group situations for too long so they usually prefer to work alone majority of the time . <p> While introverts focus on their internal world , extroverts focus primarily on the external world .

Extroverts may have no problem with this , but a spontaneous group discussion may discourage introverts , who may seem quieter than usual if forced to speak before ready . Its not that introverts inherently feel shy or closed off , they just need a moment to process their ideas before forming an opinion . Give introverts a heads up about meetings so that they have ample time to mull over their ideas before presenting them . <p> Since extroverts thrive in discussions where people feed off each others ideas , invite extroverts to lead meetings . Take things a step further and ask them to send out an agenda of discussion topics in advance . This gives introverts time to reflect prior to the meeting . Also , have a system that encourages sharing ideas after the meeting . Give extroverts a platform to toss out ideas and introverts a platform to share ideas after having time to reflect . <h> 2 . Sensing vs . Intuitive : Gathering Data <h> How they differ : <p> For a sensing person , facts and figures win out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things work , figuring out how things are interrelated , and likes to think about the future . <h> Leading these types : <p> Sensing people perform best in jobs where they can measure tangible results . For example , if you are rolling out a new product , or a new marketing campaign , your sensing people will thrive with a duty that involves tracking the results of the project . <p> The intuitive individuals can generate overall plans and determine which results should be tracked . A pairing of sensing individuals with intuitives fosters the development of big goals alongside the practical aspects of achieving those goals . Intuitives easily see the big picture and therefore do well with goal setting . Give intuitives the opportunity to dream big and think outside the box . <p> Once the overall plan is envisioned , task sensing people with the responsibility of focusing on the feasibility of the goals . Sensing people are adept at figuring out the step-by-step process in achieving goals . <h> 3 . Feeling vs Thinking : Making Decisions <h> How they differ : <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to how people will feel . They stay calm and objective . A feeler makes decisions with an eye toward harmony and prioritizes how people will feel . <h> Leading these types : <p> To get the best out of your employees , let go of arbitrary personnel practices . Rather assign employees to the job duties that best fit their personality type and best align with what they want to be doing . For example , a high-level manager who is an introvert may not want to attend networking events . Take this responsibility from the introvert , and give it to an extrovert who will better excel in the more social role of networking . The people-oriented nature of feelers allows them to understand others needs and capabilities . This makes them well-suited to delegate job duties and tasks to other employees . <p> Encourage thinkers to see the " people side " of a problem . Be aware that thinkers may be perceived by customers or other colleagues as uncaring or harsh . To combat this , remind the thinkers on your team that their coworkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try incorporating ice breakers before meetings where members should share a little bit about their lives , unrelated to work . This can personalize communication between thinkers and their coworkers so that they become familiar with others personalities and preferences . <h> 4 . Judging vs . Perceiving : Structured vs . Spontaneous <h> How they differ : <p> The judging person is well organized , they work off of lists ; they stick to a schedule . The perceiver is spontaneous , sometimes impulsive , and enjoys the unknown . <h> Leading these types : <p> Allow judgers to bring structure to projects . Note that judgers can be dismissive to new options or ways of doing things , so encourage them to entertain other viewpoints . One way to accomplish this is by creating a culture that both values idea sharing and ensures that all options are heard and considered . This will give space for all perspectives in a group since members will be required to discuss topics with an open mind . <p> By their nature perceivers want more data . Utilize this gift by asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and what specifically can be done better . Encourage them to scrutinize the organization and provide ideas on improvement . You will find that perceivers possess foresight that can keep your business on the right track . <h> Understanding the Whole Person <p> Combinations of these four personal preferences yields 16 personality types . Examine too how your personality type affects the team . For example , if you are an ESTJ ( extroversion + sensing + thinking + judging ) consider that your management style may be deemed " too bossy " by people who prefer introversion and intuition . <p> If you are an ISFJs ( introversion + sensing + feeling + judging ) you may have a difficult time delegating tasks . Employees may view this as a lack of trust in their capabilities . As you begin to assign tasks based on personality types instead of prescribed job descriptions , you may find it easier to delegate tasks . Further , as an ISFJ you understand the capabilities of others . Use this gift to tell employees exactly where they excel . Encouragement fosters trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself and your employees , you 'll be able to guide your team to peak performance and best equipped to anticipate potential problems ahead .

What 's more is that the majority of these workers began freelancing by choice , not out of necessity . Understanding why the freelance workforce is dominating the market is important if you plan to stay on top of your own business . <h> Understanding the Freelance Workforce <h> Abundance of Job Opportunities <p> The freelance economy is highly influenced by the internet . Before 1995 , the idea of a freelancer was virtually unknown . Just as the internet brings people together in the social experience , it also brings them together in the job market . Dozens of sites , apps , and devices are available to todays freelancer . With the rise of giants like Uber , Airbnb , and Upwork , there are more opportunities than ever to make money without an employer . <h> Creating Real Value <p> Freelance workers also want their work to be valuable . Where older generations found inspiration in the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work contributes positively to the world around them . By freelancing , workers are given the opportunity to choose the work they do ; often selecting projects on the basis of both pay and value . <h> A Balanced Home and Work Life <p> Compared to previous generations , present workers also seek more balance in their home and work life . Spending four hours commuting to and from work is not appealing to many people . Taking eight-hour blocks out of each day to work for the sake of job security has become equally stigmatized with a growing number of workers in this generation . Workers now place a greater emphasis on living a happy , healthy life in all areas . If a freelancer is feeling overwhelmed , they can easily reduce their workload by not taking on new projects . Having a work-life balance is now the priority and a huge factor for those in the freelance workforce . <h> How Can Your Company Benefit ? <p> Millions of people with specialized knowledge in their field make up the freelance workforce ; all for hire on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is easy to see the best way to benefit from this market- hire a freelancer . <h> Specialized Service <p> Freelancers can provide your company with a highly specialized service . For example , if your company needs varying projects done by a coder experienced in Java , but your employees only know CSS , you can benefit by hiring a freelancer who specializes in Java without the costs of replacing or hiring new employees . By simply outsourcing your coding projects to a freelancer as they come up , your company can save money and reduce your permanent workforce . <h> Flexibility <p> That said , independent workers are not out to simply provide businesses a cheap solution to projects . As a matter of fact , 77 percent of freelance workers polled said they make the same if not more money than they did as an employee doing similar tasks . Yet at the same time , freelance workers save businesses money . How can this be ? Since businesses do not have to pay for a freelance workers benefits , taxes , or the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these freelancers higher project rates . The company saves money on its project , and the freelancer actually gets paid what they are worth . <h> Accomplish Goals <p> Freelancers succeed because they are hard-working , experienced and organized . Freelancers are paid to accomplish goals . As opposed to employees who come into work every day and punch a clock ; Freelancers do not have the luxury of set schedules , paydays , and the regular benefits . So , they focus on results because that is what they are hired forto accomplish a goal and once the goal is complete they get paid . You get faster on-boarding and faster results . 
@@87520490 @3020490/ <h> 5 Ways Strategic Business Goals Fail <p> Strategic business goals set by companies fail 70% of the time . The problem is that team members cant translate the goals into their actions . What ensues is a feeling of Disappointment . Its true . The very nature of goal setting involves recognizing that for most people , they will never see their goal accomplished . In reality , what determine your end goals are the systems you create to reach them . Do n't  Confuse Systems with Goals . Its a goal to increase sales 5% by next quarter , but its a system to reach out to customers twice a week until then . <p> So why do strategic business goals fail ? <h> Top 5 Reasons Strategic Business Goals Fail <h> Reason #1 : They breed fear of success or failure . <p> " I need to increase sales 5% by next quarter , " begins as a source of inspiration , but quickly becomes a stressful chant , holding you accountable should you fail . <h> System Solution : <p> Create stepping stones towards progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be to strategize at least three marketing plans every Monday . In due time , Monday marketing plans now become a path to bettering your brand with fast and brilliant content . When you can focus on small steps , its easier to see and celebrate the progress along the wayand you have a little leeway with how you get there . <h> Reason #2 : Goals are designed to keep you dissatisfied . <p> You want to find a new job by next week , but first you need to browse the internet a few hours to seek the latest interview tips . All the while , you 're reminded that you have n't even landed an interview , let alone received a call-back . You become increasingly discouraged and stop your research . <h> System Solution : <p> Recognize that completing small tasks are marks of achievement . For example , instead of thinking about how you do n't  yet have an interview , you can remind yourself that the act of improving your communication skills makes you a stronger candidate overall . Not only does this build momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of doing , that the temptation to procrastinate starts to fall away . Systems build confidence . They show us what we can do , little by little , to reach our goal , without worrying about the end result . <p> For example , your goal is to land a job before the school semester ends . You get busier with classes and you skip three days of job hunting . You start to feel like you 've already failed in meeting your goal . <h> System Solution : <p> Before even attempting your goal , pinpoint weak areas . In this case , finals week is the busiest day of the semester and an obvious area of weakness . A perfect system to prepare for this setback is to agree to make up for lost time once finals are over . This way , you prepare yourself beforehand for a temporary setback without having to feel like you 've utterly failed . <p> Reality checkapart from the children of Millionaires , lottery winners , and royaltywe are n't  going to get rich quick . <h> System Solution : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a professional athlete , do n't  expect greatness to happen overnight . Hone your craft a little bit every day to build yourself up to your goal until practice becomes as automatic as brushing your teeth before bed . <h> Reason #5 : They create a Yo-Yo effect . <p> Because goals require stubborn , head-on commitment , they tend to dissolve as soon as they are even partially derailed . For instance , your goal may be to improve your public speaking to feel confident enough to speak at a seminar . One missed day of Communications class turns into regret or dismay , which often leads to multiple missed days , and then giving up . <h> System Solution : <p> Instead of focusing on what you failed to do , come up with incentives to keep you going .

Every step you take in your career plan from this point on will be towards the achievement of this purpose . <h> Keep Moving Forward <p> Now that you have your purpose , it is time to get logical . Is your current career the same as the dream career you wrote down ? If not , when would be a good time to change it ? As Steve Jobs said , " The only way to do great work is to love what you do . " If you truly desire everything you wrote down from that dream , it is time to take steps towards making it a reality . <p> Starting at your main career goal , identify major goals that must happen in order for your dream to be realized .

" While Walt Disney may not have known you or your personal struggle , he did understand the power that direct action has to change any persons circumstances . Once he identified his major goal in life , he never strayed from it . Now it is your turn . <p> What one career goal could you achieve that would make you look at your ideal life picture and say " I 've made it " ? This could be making a living off of your online store , creating one million dollars , becoming CEO of a fortune 500 company , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Whatever that goal is , write it down , highlight it , underline it , and memorize it . This is your main purpose . Every step you take in your career plan from this point on will be towards the achievement of this purpose . <h> Keep Moving Forward <p> Now that you have your purpose , it is time to get logical . Is your current career the same as the dream career you wrote down ? If not , when would be a good time to change it ? As Steve Jobs said , " The only way to do great work is to love what you do . " If you truly desire everything you wrote down from that dream , it is time to take steps towards making it a reality . <p> Starting at your main career goal , identify major goals that must happen in order for your dream to be realized . Break it down into many easily attainable goals , all leading to your ultimate purpose . For example , let 's say your career goal is to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be something like : <p> Create a catalog of hand-knitted dog socks <p> Hand-knit an inventory of said dog socks <p> Decide on a company name <p> Create a website for your company <p> Market your hand-knitted dog socks in multiple ways <p> Attend any and all trade shows about the wonderful world of hand-knitted dog accessories <p> Blog about hand-knitted dog socks <p> And so on <p> When you have a long list of easily attainable goals , you can prioritize them and begin to cross them off the list one by one . Breaking your long term goals up into easy tasks simplifies the process . That otherwise daunting and unattainable task will be steadily chipped away at , and before you know it , you will be living the life you wrote down on that page .

What 's more is that the majority of these workers began freelancing by choice , not out of necessity . Understanding why the freelance workforce is dominating the market is important if you plan to stay on top of your own business . <h> Understanding the Freelance Workforce <h> Abundance of Job Opportunities <p> The freelance economy is highly influenced by the internet . Before 1995 , the idea of a freelancer was virtually unknown . Just as the internet brings people together in the social experience , it also brings them together in the job market . Dozens of sites , apps , and devices are available to todays freelancer . With the rise of giants like Uber , Airbnb , and Upwork , there are more opportunities than ever to make money without an employer . <h> Creating Real Value <p> Freelance workers also want their work to be valuable . Where older generations found inspiration in the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work contributes positively to the world around them . By freelancing , workers are given the opportunity to choose the work they do ; often selecting projects on the basis of both pay and value . <h> A Balanced Home and Work Life <p> Compared to previous generations , present workers also seek more balance in their home and work life . Spending four hours commuting to and from work is not appealing to many people . Taking eight-hour blocks out of each day to work for the sake of job security has become equally stigmatized with a growing number of workers in this generation . Workers now place a greater emphasis on living a happy , healthy life in all areas . If a freelancer is feeling overwhelmed , they can easily reduce their workload by not taking on new projects . Having a work-life balance is now the priority and a huge factor for those in the freelance workforce . <h> How Can Your Company Benefit ? <p> Millions of people with specialized knowledge in their field make up the freelance workforce ; all for hire on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is easy to see the best way to benefit from this market- hire a freelancer . <h> Specialized Service <p> Freelancers can provide your company with a highly specialized service . For example , if your company needs varying projects done by a coder experienced in Java , but your employees only know CSS , you can benefit by hiring a freelancer who specializes in Java without the costs of replacing or hiring new employees . By simply outsourcing your coding projects to a freelancer as they come up , your company can save money and reduce your permanent workforce . <h> Flexibility <p> That said , independent workers are not out to simply provide businesses a cheap solution to projects . As a matter of fact , 77 percent of freelance workers polled said they make the same if not more money than they did as an employee doing similar tasks . Yet at the same time , freelance workers save businesses money . How can this be ? Since businesses do not have to pay for a freelance workers benefits , taxes , or the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these freelancers higher project rates . The company saves money on its project , and the freelancer actually gets paid what they are worth . <h> Accomplish Goals <p> Freelancers succeed because they are hard-working , experienced and organized . Freelancers are paid to accomplish goals . As opposed to employees who come into work every day and punch a clock ; Freelancers do not have the luxury of set schedules , paydays , and the regular benefits . So , they focus on results because that is what they are hired forto accomplish a goal and once the goal is complete they get paid . You get faster on-boarding and faster results .

Whether you 're running day-to-day business operations yourself or counting on a team of managers , its important to identify pitfalls of leadership in your organization . Unfortunately , manager mistakes can completely derail your operation if you or your team of managers do n't  realize you 're making them . Is your organization making any of these 9 common mistakes ? <h> Manager Mistakes to Avoid <h> 1 . Micromanaging <p> At the top of nearly every employees " complaints about the boss " list is a manager who micromanages employees . Micromanaging can be subtle , which is not a good thing . It becomes so prevalent its undetectable . Employees value trust and autonomy two things micromanaging leaves no room for . You may feel like your micromanaging is under control , but would your employees say the same ? To ensure you are n't  micromanaging , give employees the power to make important decisions , but also hold them accountable . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at performance areas that might be concerning . Fine-tune your behavior accordingly . Second , see your job as the manager does . What are your managers values , goals , and priorities ? Try to understand what they want to see . What is the common goal ? <h> 2 . Prioritizing money over people <p> Happy employees equate to higher profits . This does n't  have to go as far as ping pong tournaments in the break room , but neglecting employee satisfaction all together affects the bottom line . Make employees feel appreciated by allowing them to recognize each others good work . Create a bulletin board or an awards meeting to highlight a job well done . With these changes , collective feedback will enhance a sense of belonging and camaraderie . <h> 3 . Layering positive and negative feedback <p> This is one of the biggest communication mistakes managers make . Failing to keep positive and negative feedback separate can convolute the message you are trying to convey and leave employees wondering what exactly they should do next . Rather than sugarcoat criticism , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions and stick to the facts so the employee knows exactly what to do . <h> 4 . Neglecting the customer <p> Quality customer service and properly handling complaints can lead to a 25 and 85 percent increase in profits . If you cant provide them with what they need , do not ignore them just because you do n't  know all the answers right now . Pay attention to your clients needs and wants . Is the market changing ? <h> 5 . Pretending to understand everything : <p> As a manager , it can be tempting to keep up the perception that you hold all the answers , but its risky to save face . By failing to admit something is n't clicking for you , you 'll create more complications for you and the team . Asking questions does n't  mean you are n't  doing your job correctly , it means you are willing to be humble , gather more information , and make the right decisions together . <h> 6 . Feeling threatened by talent <p> In the famous words of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them what to do ; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do . " A good leader surrounds him or herself with individuals who excel where they do not . <h> 7 . Overworking employees : <p> This shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours , and productivity drops after 55 hours that you do n't  get anything out of working . To avoid falling into this trap , envision what a work day must be like for your staff . Start a discussion on both of your expectations . Are your expectations feasible ? The last thing you want to do is burn out a good employee . <h> 8 . Implementing too many changes , too fast <p> New managers , in particular , are prone to certain mistakes one of them being " shaking things up " immediately after entering a new position . Its best to tread lightly here and focus on creating relationships with your team before implementing new policy and procedures that change the way they do business . <h> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to reach for excuses is not much of a leader . Leadership responsibility includes admitting fault so that you can tweak performance . Be transparent about your error , but be ready with a backup plan . Always follow up with how you know this issue effects everyone else and you 're working to fix it . Not only will this build trust , but its also the perfect way to lead by example .

Now that the average employee can spend their day immersed in emails , browsing social media , accessing their phones , and surfing the internet , its become necessary for companies to train their employees in the practices of good internet etiquette . Following these four rules of internet etiquette in the workplace can keep yourself secure and professional . <h> 4 Basic Rules of Internet Etiquette <h> 1 . Email <p> Email Professionally . Having a corporate email means having the responsibility to reflect your companys name and virtues with every interaction . Speak clearly and concisely . Proofread your work , format it to be brief but purposeful , and avoid using capitalized words , slang , spelling errors , or other distracting text . Consider your audience at all times . <h> 2 . Social Media <p> Adding employees on social media can sound like either a great idea or a risky one . With over 65% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter , it can be hard to discern whether or not adding your colleague is appropriate . The best rule of thumb is to keep yourwork life professional , and your personal life separate . If you are n't  comfortable having your employees over for dinner , they probably shouldnt be seeing pictures of last Saturdays barbeque . <p> If you do go ahead and " friend " your employees , take responsibility and know your companys views on this . Refrain from posting political or religious content , and speak from the point of view of your company , not your personal life . Your social media use with your colleagues should look the same as your conversation with them in person , if not more cordial . After all , it will be there for the entire internet to see and track . <h> 3 . Smartphone <p> Limit your smartphone use during work hours . If you 're talking to an employee , in a meeting , or are tempted to answer personal messages , emails , or callsat work is not the time . Set your phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with creating productive work . Your Smartphone is a tool to be used during your personal breaks or at lunch , not to be displayed in front of your coworkers . If using your Smartphone is essential for communicating at work , proofread before you send your messages , and double check your grammar and spelling . <h> 4 . Internet Browsing <p> Internet browsing on work computers is not private . Treat all of your social media usage as if your boss were staring right over your shoulder . Understand what appropriate browsing behavior at your company is , and err on the side of caution . The best internet surfing to be conducted at work , is work-related . If you have the time to browse , find ways to improve yourself as an employee . <p> For managers , it is important to inform employees of proper internet etiquette . Create a policy to demonstrate to your employees what is and is n't acceptable behavior , and lead by example . Communicate clearly , without leaving room for misunderstanding . Be polite , cordial , and mind your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from your work .

Generally , a leader is someone who holds a position of power and tells others what to do . Finding a great leader is often like finding a needle in a haystack . Find out the difference between a run-of-the-mill leader , and a truly great one with the following top five qualities of great leaders . <h> 1 . They are Visionaries <p> Without a vision , there is no direction or end goal in sight . Therefore , great leaders think with the future in mind in order to plan the best route to reach their goal . This may be a CEO who wants to enter a new market , or a small business owner starting his first company . Each and every leader needs to have a vision of where they are going , which is thought out in fine detail . This is the driving force to success , and the vision which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same direction . Vision is used to inspire and motivate , both the leader and everyone in their sphere of influence . <h> 2 . They are Decision Makers <p> The second quality a leader must possess in order to be great , is the willingness and confidence to make decisions . Decisions can carry a wide range of consequences , which may be good or may be bad . Decisions can also carry risks for the company , which can be intimidating . However , a great leader will weigh the pros and cons . They examine the variety of options , consider all those who will be affected by the decision and use their intuition to make the call with the best of his or her ability . The leader will stand up to criticism confidently and explain their choice ; ready to accept the consequences . If problems arise , the leader accepts this and learns for the future . All this considered , a great leader will step up and make decisions frequently and promptly . <h> 3 . They have Integrity <p> Integrity is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being honest , consistent , and transparent . The leader with integrity can achieve their goals by telling the truth and keeping their word without the use of manipulation . The words and deeds of the leader form a coherent whole , which is consistent in thought and action , regardless of the place and circumstances . This attribute encourages people to trust their leader and remain loyal to their vision . <h> 4 . They Cooperate <p> A great leader understands that getting people to do what they want comes from cooperation , not dictatorship . A great leader will work amongst their employees to share their vision , motivate , encourage , and create a system of accountability . They will delegate responsibilities and build trust with others . Great leaders achieve their visions through cooperation and the help of their teams . It is about choice not force ; inspiration not fear . <h> 5 . They Hold Themselves Accountable <p> Lastly , a great leader takes accountability for all of their results . They will own up to successes and failures , and look for ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a fair and well-understood infrastructure . <p> Being a great leader is no easy task .

Steve Jobs , founder and CEO of Apple , personally screened over 5,000 job applicants during his tenure . He believed in being involved in the hiring process because he felt strongly that " A small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players . " <p> The first step in ensuring you make a good hire is to spot candidates who are n't  presenting an honest picture of their background and experience . Here are five surefire ways to help you land the perfect candidate . <h> Top 5 Ways to Spot a Liar During the Hiring Process <h> 1 .

However , its important not to confuse nerves with dishonesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may fidget or break eye contact . Do n't  immediately assume that the candidate is hiding something if this occurs . Conversely , cues such as arm crossing , hand or face touching , as well as breaks in posture or leaning away may serve as a tell for dishonesty . <h> 2 . Watch Their Words <p> Like their body language , a candidates words often can serve as a lens into their integrity . Pay attention to certain verbal cues that may prove helpful in determining whether a candidate is being truthful with you . For example , if the candidates contradict themselves , are too vague or are unable to provide specific details related to their experience , this may serve as a warning that something is not kosher . Furthermore , if the candidate appears to be too scripted or rigid in their presentation of their background or experience , it also may serve as a clue that they are being less than forthcoming with the truth . <h> 3 . Test Their Mettle <p> Screening and hiring candidates for your company requires a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Performing such tests adds a level of transparency to the hiring process that both parties are a solid fit for the opportunity . <h> 4 . Do Your Homework <p> If your prospective candidate makes it through the interview and testing stages , its time for you to do some homework . Do some digging and confirm the information they shared on the resume and during the interview process . Call previous employers and confirm dates of employment , job titles and duties performed . Check references presented to make sure that the candidates character is in line with their interview . Do n't  be afraid to check online and observe social media accounts to see how the person conducts themselves .

It is surely not something a working professional would partake in . In actuality , studies are finding there are many benefits of napping ; with both short naps and long naps proving useful to the body . Short naps are anywhere from 5-15 minutes and can promote an instant boost in wakefulness that can last for a few hours after the nap .

Do your homework . <p> If you 're going to ask for more money , you need to know what others in your field , with your level of experience and expertise , command in todays job market . Websites that list general salary information such as glassdoor.com are a good place to start , but they are n't  always up-to-date . Instead of relying on them , make a few phone calls to colleagues and friends in your field with similar job descriptions .

@@87520581 @3020581/ <h> Business Management Skills : 7 Signs of a Poor Manager <p> An overwhelming 65 percent of employees in North America do not trust their companys leadership . This may seem arbitrary enough ; some employees say they hate their boss yet how much of it is for a good reason , and how much is due to the need for rebellion ? A new study shows that managers can account for up to 70 percent of variance in employee engagement . The main takeaway from this statistic is the importance of managers possessing effective business management skills . Be on the lookout for these signs of a poor manager and ways to avoid these mistakes yourself . <h> Top 7 Signs of Poor Business Management Skills <h> 1 . Passive Aggressiveness <p> Signs of passive aggressiveness are n't  always apparent . Things , like micromanaging small details and giving vague project directions ( only to scold you later for doing it incorrectly ) , are big signs of passive aggressiveness from your manager . In the management role , check in with your employees to make sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking it . A happy employee is an engaged employee , and the inverse is true as well . <h> 2 . Unconscious Actions <p> If a manager is always talking about cleanliness in the workplace , yet theyve often left soda bottles on the break room table , this is a bit of a red flag . It not only shows a lack of responsibility for their actions , its plain unconscious behavior . If you are in a management position , it is important to remember the wise adage practice what you preach . Awareness about your own actions helps to keep you in check before reprimanding someone for making the same mistakes as you . <h> 3 . The Credit Thief <p> Nothing will ruin a reputation quite like taking credit for anothers accomplishments . In a manager , it is a particularly bad habit . Not only does it immediately take them down in the eyes of their employees ; but when their superiors find out they ca n't duplicate these results on their own , theyll be on the chopping block . If your employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will boost workplace morale and familiarize you with an employees strengths , so you may better organize tasks in the future . <h> 4 . The Lost Temper <p> They say a lost temper can never be found , and that may be especially true for managers . A coworker who raises their voice out of anger in the workplace is quickly labeled a loose cannon . When a manager raises their voice , it can make you question their self-control and ability to lead at all . If you are the manager and you find yourself getting angry in the workplace , take a step back . Ask for some time to yourself , or say " I 'll get back to you in an email " . This may not be as satisfying as shouting at your employees ; but then again , it will keep you from looking like a toddler . <h> 5 . The Brown-nose <p> Whether in customer relations or the office , rapport is important . It is n't everything , however . A manager who spends most of their time complimenting workers , colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , it is all the manager knows how to do . If simply sucking up to the boss and playing nice with coworkers were the only business management skills that got you to the position , it certainly wo n't keep you there . Replace a couple of those pats on the back with productive reviews , and everyone in the office will be much more impressed with you . <h> 6 . Playing Favorites <p> Again , rapport in the workplace is a great thing ; people want to feel they are working for a likable character . However , if the manager has a buddy in the office who constantly underperforms , fails to complete deadlines , and neglects their work in group assignments ; you can be sure coworkers are upset with them both . As a manager , it is important to keep friendships outside of the office . The workplace is for just that work . If anyone in the workplace is underperforming , it is your job to let them know . <h> 7 . Slippery Decision Making <p> Some poor managers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sit back and let issues sort themselves out ; and even when asked a direct question , they are likely to say " I 'll get back to you on that " or " Go ask Alice about it " . As a manager , its not that you are saving face by not making decisions ; you are actually revealing your insecurities . Your team looks to you for guidance ; if you are afraid of making mistakes , how likely is your team to succeed when lead by an indecision ? <p> The management role is key to success in any industry .

This short attention span means that as blog writers working for optimal content SEO , crafting your content to immediately grab your readers attention is at an all-time high in terms of priority . <p> While this type of approach is hardly a new one , many businesses still appear to struggle with understanding their audience and the reason they 're blogging in the first place . Are they creating content strictly for search engines to crawl or for people to read ? The right answer regardless of industry is both . <h> Understanding Content SEO <p> Understanding the main concept of content SEO does n't  need to be overly complicated , in fact , its actually quite simple . The idea behind it has always remained that you create valuable content that helps your website rank higher up on search engine results pages ( SERP ) . The methods behind doing this , however , are a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> A Holistic Approach to Content SEO <p> In the past , content SEO strategies revolved around integrating target keywords to focused pages on your website . The idea behind this was that by creating a keyword optimized page and building links to it , search engines would be more likely to crawl those sites and display them near the top of the SERP . <p> Today , however , many industry leaders agree that a holistic approach to SEO is the best way to improve your search rankings . This type of content marketing strategy focuses on creating web pages that can best serve the reader . After all , when people search the internet for answers , they 're likely looking for a source that can provide them with some sort of value . <p> Search engine algorithms constantly change and evolve . The lone constant they 've always strived for , however , is to locate the content that most accurately represents what users want . This does n't  mean that you forget about keywords altogether . However , the days of keyword stuffing and watching your rankings rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of your readers , you can increase your SERPs rankings by providing high-quality , well-written content . <h> Write to Be Seen <p> The truth of the matter is , your SEO content strategy needs to be strong in order for you to succeed . Without a proper SEO content marketing strategy , you may as well be writing blogs , printing them out , and posting them to your company fridge . It all comes down to visibility , and without strong content SEO , no one can see you or any of the great things your company is up to . <p> Understanding SEO practices can be complex , but the main idea is that after finding relevant keywords you want to rank for , you begin implementing those into a content marketing strategy . By placing these important keywords in your content , you 're letting the search engines know what it is you 're writing about . While keyword volume was once the go-to strategy , the rise of semantic search has given way to the integration of Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI ) keywords into content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which search engines can use to obtain a more clear understanding of what the content is truly about . <p> For example , let 's say you 're using " office safety " as a target keyword . This is a broad topic that will make it hard for your page to rank considering the internet is likely crowded with similar content on the subject . However , if you also include phrases like office fire safety and fire evacuation plans , search engines can understand your content is about how to remain safe during an office fire as opposed to let 's say , sexual harassment in the office or violent employees . <h> Write for your Readers <p> So we know that writing with search engines in mind remains just as important today as it was years ago , but what does that mean for our readers ? Truth be told , the days of " over-optimizing " your content are long gone . Googles search algorithm is too smart for that now .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to think about the types of things you enjoy reading online . <p> Creating quality , eye-catching content helps to grab the readers attention and keep them on your site .

@@87520607 @3020607/ <h> 3 SEO Practices to Rank Your Business at the Top <p> The known internet contains well over 4.75 billion web pages . That 's almost a page for every person on the planet . With competition this stiff , drawing traffic to your website relies on your search engine optimization or SEO . With all this competition , you have likely been told you will need to use search engine optimization ( SEO ) practices to get traffic to your companys website . Its true , page optimization is great for your business but do you know why ? Learning some helpful SEO practices how search engines " think " helps you understand why these practices may land your business website on that coveted top spot in the rankings . <h> How Search Engines Think <p> Larry Page , the co-founder and CEO of Google , once said " The perfect search engine would understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want " . This says a lot about the aim of search engines . <p> Search engines have one main purpose : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users as quickly as possible . To achieve this purpose , search engines have 3 main functions- crawling , indexing , and retrieving . Understanding how these functions work will help you understand how you can better cater to them . <h> 1 . Crawling <p> Simply put , crawling is the act of scanning your website into a database . Automated bots called spiders rapidly read your page ; getting a complete list of what it contains . Search engines crawl the title of the page , the pages keywords , images , and important text . Then the pages it links to with hyperlinks are crawled , and the process is repeated . The spider then stores the new links into a database of sites to be crawled over again . The process is never ending , and designed to make sure a search engines database is as up-to-date as possible . <h> 2 . Indexing <p> Now that all the data on your page is collected , what do they do with it ? Here is where much of those SEO practices come into play . Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as keywords and links to and from your page . The index also marks aspects such as when the page was posted and if there are pictures or videos on the page . <p> Say you run a stuffed animal shop ; Bills Teddy Bears . Keywords such as , " teddy bears " and " stuffed animals " likely become indexed by search engines . Similarly , search engines index any images found on your site as well . If your shop has 300 pictures of a red stuffed giraffe , it is a great option to show a user looking for images of a red stuffed giraffe . Links to and from your page are also factored in . <p> This is also where the importance of guest blogging comes in . If the national stuffed animal association links to your site , you gain relevance based on their reputation . <p> All of this helps the algorithms pick up relevant data for their users in the next section retrieving . <h> 3 . Retrieving <p> Search engines use hundreds of variables to decide how to display their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the links the content contains , the title and URL of the page , and how fresh the page is ; all factors into giving users the most relevant results . Search engines also look for synonyms to your keywords , always attempting to figure out what you mean and delivering it to you . They do this billions of times each day . <p> This is why it is good to build each page around a keyword or phrase . <h> Keywords and Phrases <p> In our example , let 's say a user searches " fix a stuffed animal " ; they will likely not see results for companies which only sell new stuffed animals . They would see articles on how to fix them and who to call if they need help fixing them . If you want to rank your page , you will want to include the keywords in all aspects of the page . The title will say something like " How to Fix a Stuffed Animal " . The URL would be **40;120;TOOLONG . The headline of the article would be " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page itself will contain useful information about fixing stuffed animals . It will also have synonyms of the keyword ; it may say " repair your teddy bear " or " mend a plush toy " . These are the very basic factors search engines look for when deciding how valuable your page is to their users . <p> Knowing some basic SEO practices can give you the upper hand in understanding how to cater to them . Its important , however , that you do n't  cater to search engines at the expense of your readership . At the very least , it can help to see why SEO practices are absolutely necessary for your business to succeed online
