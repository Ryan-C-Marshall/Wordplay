It turns out there is n't a straight yes or no answer to this question , but we can walk you through it. - <p> Before you get into the legalities of serving alcohol , think about what your community wants . Some folks have strong feelings about having no alcohol at an event , while others feel it adds a nice touch to an adults-only event . So , ask around and get a feel for what your parents would be comfortable with. - <p> Next , find out whether you need a license to serve alcohol . Check with your town clerk 's office to find out if this is necessary and ask whether the town issues one-time liquor licenses . Some communities issue this type of license to charitable organizations ( like PTOs ) for a special event . An alternative is to plan your event at a restaurant or club in your community that has its own liquor license. - <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and is n't covered under your current insurance policy . If you do n't currently have insurance , it 's a good idea to give that consideration now , not just to cover alcohol but also to help protect your group throughout the year . PTOs are able to get insurance through PTO Today . <p> You may have a general liability policy and need to pick up additional liquor liability insurance . For example , say your PTO is hosting an event at a local restaurant . Your group will not be selling the liquor ; the host ( restaurant ) is actually providing it . In this case , your PTO may be covered by your general liability policy . But , do n't assume . Many other factors , including the size of the event , can come into play . <p> If you have insurance through PTO Today , your best bet is to fill out a short form we have on our site requesting liquor liability insurance . In this form , you briefly explain the details of your event ( will food also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of attendees , etc . ) . The insurance carrier will review this and determine whether additional coverage is needed. - <p> The bottom line is it 's best to check about liquor liability before your event . And try to check in at least a week ahead of time in the event that you need to purchase the additional coverage . <p> It makes sense to get this resolved so you can relax and everyone can have a fun and safe time at your event. -

They should contain a job description for the treasurer 's job . They should also state which positions are considered board positions . The situation you describe sounds unworkable . It 's possible to divide the treasurer 's job between a treasurer and an assistant , but even that takes a lot of communication and coordination . No matter what , do n't relinquish the checkbook , and do n't be bullied into writing checks . If your group is n't operating from a budget , your board should create one . It makes it a lot easier to do business , including writing reimbursement checks .

@@35478751 @4478751/ <h> Annual Audit : How and Why <p> A yearly audit is a key safeguard for your money and a planning tool for the year ahead . Think of it as a " year in review " for your finances . <p> by Christy Forhan <p> 01/16/2017 <p> Do you cringe when you hear the word " audit " ? Perhaps it brings to mind accountants with green eye shades , sharp pencils , and large ledger sheets . Or maybe you think of a surly IRS agent poring over your books to find a 20-cent tax error so he can fine you thousands of dollars . <p> But it does n't have to be that way . The audit is one of those misunderstood , often-frightening terms that can make PTO treasurers quiver . In fact , an annual audit is an important and irreplaceable tool to keep your financial house in order . And in practice , it is not at all as bad as you might think . <p> Every year , thousands of dollars likely move in and out of your PTO 's bank account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire executive board is responsible for the care of the money and to ensure that it is being handled properly . At the end of every school year , you all can ease your minds by facilitating an audit of your PTO 's financial records . In this context , an audit is simply a detailed review of your financial records rather than the formal legal certification of books that major corporations run . <p> The primary benefit of an annual audit is the confidence it gives you and your members that the PTO 's financial house is in order . Basically , the audit verifies the numbers , ensures accuracy , and assesses procedures . A comprehensive audit also identifies internal controls that should be implemented to improve the integrity of your financial systems . Furthermore , the audit gives closure to the treasurer and sets a starting point for the new year 's activity . An audit is also the primary tool for uncovering financial mismanagement . Hopefully you wo n't need to conduct an audit for this reason , but an annual audit can uncover problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also choose to include in your audit a review of how closely your group 's income and expenditures matched the year 's budget . This type of review can be a strong planning tool . <h> Who Does the Audit ? <p> There are several options for who might conduct your audit . Some PTOs form an audit committee , some recruit a volunteer from the parent community , and some groups hire a professional certified public accountant . When using volunteer labor , it is important that the executive board communicates clearly the requirements , responsibilities , and time commitment expected of the volunteers so they are prepared for the task ahead . <p> Audit Committee . An audit committee should consist of three to five people who have not had access to the PTO checkbook or bank account . Because questions might arise about the details of PTO operations , it can be helpful to include an officer , perhaps the vice president or secretary , as a member of the audit committee . The others should be volunteers from the general PTO membership . The treasurer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee . <p> As a group , the volunteers must be willing and able to meet at least twice during the " off season , " usually summer . While individual audit tasks can be delegated , the committee will need to discuss the objectives and conclusions as a group . <p> The audit can also be done by a single volunteer , especially if your group has tight financial controls and good records that will streamline the audit process . <p> CPA . Some large PTOs choose to hire a CPA to conduct their annual financial review . The professional will have insight , ideas , and experience that the typical volunteer does not . When considering hiring a professional , be prepared to spend $200 or more . Search for a firm that specializes in nonprofit organizations . <p> Regardless of who conducts your PTO 's audit , you should organize the year 's financial records . This preparation alone can highlight areas for improvement in record-keeping and reporting . If you use good financial controls throughout the year , you should be able to gather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if recordkeeping has not been a priority this year , be prepared to spend some time organizing your files . <p> Here is a checklist of records that are typically used for a comprehensive annual review . Providing these records makes the auditor 's job easier . However , do n't avoid an audit just because you do n't have any of these . <p> Bank statements for the year <p> Bank account reconciliation reports <p> Check register ( remove it from your checkbook and keep the blank checks in your possession ) <p> Canceled checks <p> A list of transactions ( the transactions journal if you use a computer-based bookkeeping system ) <p> Reimbursement and check request forms , including receipts/invoices for all expenditures <p> Deposit slips <p> Monthly treasurer reports and annual budget <p> IRS Form 990 if your PTO has formally registered as a 501(c) ( 3 ) organization <p> Any written treasurer procedures or training materials <p> If the scope of your review includes the PTO 's performance to budget , then you should also include your current bylaws , minutes from all meetings at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at year 's end , which are typically included in the monthly treasurers report . <h> When To Audit <p> Your regular annual audit should be conducted at the end of the PTO 's fiscal year , after the bulk of the school years activity has been completed . For most PTOs , that is in mid- to late summer . Inevitably , you may still have a few checks outstanding , but there should be very little other financial activity at this time . Even if your current treasurer will continue in the position next year and even if she has done a stellar job and even if the task of auditing seems too difficult , complete the audit anyway . It is an essential step in managing the groups financial resources and should be taken seriously , even when everything is obviously in order . Set the precedent now and the audit will become a must-do into the future . <p> An audit should also be considered when the office of treasurer changes mid-year . In this case the audit is conducted as of a specific cut-off date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is taking over a clean house . <p> Finally , if there is ever the suspicion that there has been financial mismanagement , an audit should be conducted immediately . <h> What the Auditor Does <p> You can facilitate the audit by providing a checklist of steps and a worksheet for the auditor . These guidelines can make the whole process much easier to grasp , especially if your auditors are volunteers unfamiliar with public accounting . These are the basic audit steps . <p> Verify that all checks written during the year are accounted for , approved , signed , substantiated , and not defaced , and that they have been posted to the proper budget category . <p> Verify that all deposits made during the year have been logged accurately and assigned to the proper budget category . <p> Review the bank statements for any unusual fees or withdrawals ( check printing fees , for example ) . Verify proper recordkeeping for these items . Ensure the account was reconciled each month . <p> Verify that IRS Form 990 and any state forms ( incorporation renewal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessary . <p> Verify that the treasurer reports add up from month to month . <p> Complete a worksheet that summarizes the year 's financial activity , including beginning cash balance , total receipts during the audit period , disbursements , and ending cash balance , among others . This is often called the financial review worksheet . <p> Suggest improvements to internal controls such as record-keeping and cash-handling , if needed . <p> Assess the group 's performance against its budget , if requested . <h> The Auditor 's Report <p> The report from the auditor will mark the completion of the review . If you are using volunteers , you should clearly itemize what you expect back , so your auditors know when they have completed their job . <p> At minimum , the auditor should submit a signed statement that the review has been completed and the books have been found to be in order . If the auditor found any exceptions during the course of the review , such as an unrecorded check or a mathematical error , those should be noted and included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception . The report should also include the completed financial review worksheet . <p> A more robust report would also include a list of financial control recommendations . Your auditor might recommend that all PTO checks be signed by two officers , for example . Finally , the auditor 's report might also highlight unusual financial risks the PTO is taking and suggest ways to mitigate the risk . For example , your auditor might recommend that the PTO use a locking cash box for collecting fundraising checks rather than an open , unsecured basket . <p> Ensure that your auditor has returned the files you provided , and file the original report in the PTOs permanent archives . At the first meeting of the new school year , you should present the auditors report and move that it be adopted . According to Robert 's Rules of Order , once the annual report of the auditor is adopted , it is no longer necessary to move to adopt each month 's treasurer 's report . The reports are presented and then simply filed for next year 's audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic financial controls , your annual audit can be almost automatic . Simple things like keeping your paper files organized , using only pencil in the check register , sequentially ordering your canceled checks , and stapling receipts to the authorizing forms can ease the workload on the auditor . <p> With poor controls , it is difficult for an auditor to determine that all transactions have been properly substantiated and recorded . If you expect your volunteers to dig through stacks of crumpled receipts , boxes of disorganized bank statements , and pages of messy transaction journals , you probably are expecting too much . The audit will be compromised and its reputation as a difficult and unwelcome activity will persist , to the detriment of the PTO . In that case , you should make the commitment to hire a professional auditor . As well , you can organize your work with PTO Today Finance Manager , easy-to-use web-based software that helps you manage your group 's finances all in one place . <p> I see one CPA criticized the article because of the $200 for an audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet this is still a very good article . The only part that I question , and hopefully the expert CPA will chime in too , is " Simple things like keeping your paper files organized , using only pencil in the check register , sequentially ordering your canceled checks , and stapling receipts to the authorizing forms can ease the workload on the auditor . " Gosh , alarm bells go off when I think someone is using a pencil for anything other than a standardized test . So I disagree that a pencil is correct , and if there are also smudge marks , yikes . <p> Regarding the netting of income and expenses in Finance Manager . The software is very basic , and for good reason . 99% of the users are n't accountants , and frankly the other 1% would probably use Quickbooks anyway . I like the netting . It makes it way easier for me to explain how a fundraiser did , or whether or not the Teacher Appreciation committee went over budget . I can show the members one number , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you separte the transactions into Income and Expense , I have to do the math on the spot in order ot see the net result of any project .

I use the reports to communicate with other non-accountants and it seems to work for us , even for budgeting . <p> Yes , it is great if a PTO can get an accountant to volutneer his/her time to manage the PTO 's finances . That woudl be the best of all possible scenarios . Lacking that , however , it is better to teach non-accountants the basics than to just assume everyone can figure it out on his/her own . The use of the word " audit " in this website may be oversimplification for a CPA . Clearly , a CPA would take exception with the term being used informally . But most readers here are n't  ' approaching their PTOs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and to the point and evokes the notion of an annual financial review . I do n't think this website is trying to minimize the importance of a real CPA-led audit , simply by using the shorthand word . I suppose the folks who make Kleenex sigh every time their name is used to refer to any old tissue . No one is trying to mislead anyone . It 's just a quick way to communicate . <p> Kudos Becky on explaining the differences on what we do ! In addition , the problem I found is not with fraud but lack of knowledge of accounting practices . If you net out income to expense accounts it can cause under reporting on Form 990 . Not to mention it does n't give you a clear vision of the financial history for effective budgeting . Looking at the PTO Finance Manager software manual they suggest doing exactly this to treasurer 's who may not have any accounting experience or knowledge to know it is not good practice .

They will be able to give you duplicate records--checks written , plus deposits and withdrawals . If there is large-scale fraud , it probably will be apparent fairly quickly . Get committee chairs to piece together their expenses--if they did n't keep their own records , they should at least remember the major items . Communicate your concerns to the principal ; she may be able to help . And act now -- in any fraud situation , matters only get worse as time goes on .

@@35478761 @4478761/ <h> Finding and Winning Grants <p> Parent groups can and do get grants . Just follow a few simple rules to put together a winning application . <p> by Carolyn Tomlin <p> 03/09/2017 <p> Grants can be an excellent source of funding for parent groups . In fact , millions of dollars in educational grants go unawarded every year simply because no one applied for them . <p> Obtaining money through a grant is not like earning it through fundraising . As a rule , fundraising dollars can be spent on whatever you wish " from school supplies to volunteer appreciation to inflatables for the carnival . On the other hand , organizations typically award grants for special projects . The range is broad , but your application must state specifically what you need the money for and how you will spend it . Then , you must follow the plan you laid out . In most cases , you also will be required to account for how the grant money was spent . <p> The good news is that you do n't have to be a professional grantwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many grants , simply following a few basic rules will suffice . <h> Getting Started <p> When you begin thinking about whether a grant will make sense for your group , consider this question : Where is the gap , and what can your parent group do to fix it ? Grantmakers fund a wide range of activities . Your challenge is to decide where your need lies , find the right organization to sponsor it , then make the case for why you deserve the funds . <p> Real projects funded through grants to parent groups include age-appropriate playground equipment , landscaping , nature trails , water gardens , wildflower gardens ( focus on wildflowers of your state ) , math and science workstations , computer equipment ( upgrade , repair , and software purchases ) , support for an early learning center ( for supplemental items not paid for by federal grants to the district ) , office assistants not funded through the school system , athletic equipment and uniforms , band equipment and uniforms , and programs promoting sports for girls , among many others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who can work together for a common cause is not difficult . Can you identify a person in your parent group who has writing experience ? Does this person understand the importance of meeting deadlines ? Can this person delegate work to the various members of a committee ? <p> If the grant is for something to be used by the school , the principal should be part of the committee . Include a teacher who shows an interest in supporting a new program , if appropriate . Avoid working with an overly large group , but take advantage of key people in the school and community who are dedicated and dependable and who have integrity . Computer skills and access to school data can be important . <p> One note : Virtually all formal grants are available only to organizations officially registered with the IRS as tax-exempt under section 501(c) ( 3 ) of the federal tax code . If your group is a 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit , you should have a determination letter from the IRS . ( PTO Today has a step-by-step guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTO Startup Toolkit . ) <p> If your group is not officially tax-exempt , the grant should be prepared on behalf of the school , with funds going directly to the school . <h> Grants , Step by Step <p> Local organizations provide the best funding opportunities for parent groups . Use this outline to give your grant request the best opportunity for success . <p> Become highly visible in your community . Networking is vital . Contacts made through the chamber of commerce , civic organizations , volunteer activities , fundraising events for charities or religious institutions , and your children 's extracurricular events all offer opportunities for connecting with people in the business community . <p> Check with the local chamber of commerce for a listing of businesses and industries in the same region as your school . Note companies that are part of a franchise and those that maintain corporate offices in larger cities . <p> Identify CEOs , community resource personnel , or plant managers as your contacts . Call or make an appointment to visit and discuss your grant needs . Does the company have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , sports , programs for gifted students , or other areas that strengthen the curriculum ? Never overlook the number one rule in funding : The proposal must meet the grantmaker 's priorities . If a foundation supports math programs , do n't ask for band instruments . <p> Does the foundation provide a grant application ? Can it be downloaded from the website or sent by mail ? If no formal application is available , ask whether a simple grant format outlining the following points will be acceptable : <p> What you want to do <p> How you are going to do it <p> Who you hope to serve <p> What you hope to accomplish <p> How you will spend the money <p> How you will give a final report of the grant <p> Appoint a grantwriting team from your parent group and school faculty . As you assemble a team , consider parent group members , teachers , and staff members who work well together ; people who are familiar with finances ; and those who possess an expertise in writing , are responsible about deadlines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Review the grant proposal . Designate individuals to provide specific information , such as school and community data , goals , objectives , and budget . Assign just one person , however , to write the proposal itself . <p> Federal grants and some foundations usually require a collaboration with other community agencies ( in addition to the school ) . Enlist an institute of higher education if possible . Other options might be a community health agency , public library , technology center , or other agency that could reinforce your proposal . Request a letter of support on company letterhead stating the organization 's role as collaborator . Enclose support letters as attachments to the grant . The proposal length may be limited , but attachments are not included in the page count . The grantmaker is not required to read the attachments . <p> Ask a qualified person to read the grant before submission . Does he have questions about the clarity of the proposal ? The grantmaker will have them also . <p> It 's crucial to send your grant request prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra money to send it overnight . Even if you send it regular mail , you might want to pay for delivery confirmation . Do not contact the funder after submission . Foundations may read grants quarterly or annually . If you fail to complete the proposal prior to the deadline , send it for the next deadline . <p> Check the number of copies required . Stamp one " original " and place it on top . Stamp " copy " on the others . Use blue ink for signatures . Keep a copy of the grant for your parent group . Provide copies for any agencies that collaborated with you . <h> Finding Grants <p> There are four main types of organizations that issue grants : corporations , national foundations , local foundations , and the government ( primarily federal ) . <p> Corporations provide funding in two ways . Perhaps the most common is through a local outlet or office . You approach the manager of a local business and ask for a donation of cash , products , or services for a particular activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event , a thank-you in your newsletter , and other considerations . The manager typically will give you a yes or no on the spot or a short time later . <p> Some corporations also offer funds through a company-sponsored foundation or regular corporate giving program . Corporations typically support organizations with programs that benefit communities where employees live and work . Grants include cash , company products , or in-kind services . When applying , think of ways you can provide publicity that portrays the company as a philanthropist in the community . Personal contact is often vital to successful funding . <p> Private foundations are independent nonprofit organizations with an endowment usually managed by their own trustees or directors . A single source " an individual or family group " donates money for grants . When applying to a private foundation , identify a need and show how the grant may solve a problem in a creative way that can be replicated at other schools . Private foundations typically are not a good source for parent groups , but you 'll have a much better shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the organization . <p> Community foundations are similar to private foundations except that the money comes from many donors . Usually located in larger metropolitan areas , these foundations may support programs not paid for by the school district . You might be required to provide matching funds . It 's crucial to know the geographic area of giving for community foundations before you apply . <p> Federal grants are offered by the government and support new programs for a school district or cluster of schools . But they 're aimed at schools rather than parent groups , they 're competitive , and you 'll need a professional grantwriter . <h> The Final Step : Appreciation <p> When you receive a grant , particularly from a local source , it 's crucial to acknowledge the organization publicly . Here are some ideas for acknowledging the grant . <p> Invite the plant manager to a school assembly . Present him with a framed certificate of appreciation . <p> If the company is small , assist students in making original birthday cards for employees . Deliver the cards to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your school . Decorate a special table and make them your guests of honor . <p> Place recognition publicly , such as a sign in your schoolyard that says " Playground equipment provided by the XYZ Company . " <p> Send information to the local newspaper about funding you receive from a local foundation . Take photos of the check being presented . <p> Ask the company to be an education partner with your school . Invite employees to read to students during their lunch hour , for example . <p> Many factors determine which groups receive grant funding . Identifying the need , finding the right foundation , and working together as a group make for a successful proposal . <h> Where To Look for Grants <p> Large grants attract professional grantwriters , and the competition is stiff . Yet smaller grants can be difficult to find . The following resources can get you started . <p> The chamber of commerce in your area may be able to identify companies offering education grants . <p> SchoolGrants offers free information on organizations offering grants to schools . The site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation Giving Trends is a book updated yearly that lists the largest foundations in the United States and the types of causes they commonly fund . It 's published and sold by the Foundation Center . www.fdncenter.org <p> The Foundation Directory Online , also from the Foundation Center , is a subscription service that provides frequently updated information on 80,000 grantmakers. **26;0;TOOLONG <p> Quinlan Publishing offers several biweekly publications of interest to schools seeking grants , including " Funding Private Schools " and " Grants for K-12 Hotline . " The publications include current information on corporate grants , with descriptions of the application process . www.quinlan.com <p> The U.S. Census Bureau lists data on your town and state that can be helpful in preparing your application . www.census.gov <p> FedStats is another source of information that may be helpful to grantwriters . It 's a collection of links to public statistical information from a variety of government agencies . www.fedstats.gov <h> A Grant Program for Parent Groups <p> It 's rare that a grant program is aimed specifically at parent groups , but that 's the case with Lowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as many as 1,000 schools nationwide . It 's by far the largest and most ambitious grant program ever to target parent groups . <p> " We value the important role that parent-teacher groups play in building successful schools and strong school communities , " says Larry Stone , chairman of the Lowe 's Charitable and Educational Foundation . " By making financial resources available to PTOs and PTAs , we believe we are not only investing in projects that are important to our customers and employees , but we 're also helping schools build a stronger foundation for the children who will be tomorrow 's employees , homeowners , and community leaders . " <p> Grants of up to $5,000 are available . They will be awarded to support a wide range of projects , but preference is given to projects that encourage parent involvement and build community spirit . <p> Carolyn Tomlin has been a public school teacher , a university professor , and the grantwriter for the Jackson-Madison County School System in Jackson , Tenn . She teaches grantwriting workshops and is the author of Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your great post about grant writing for fundraising . We 've had great success finding education grants for our elementary school through Grant Watch . There are also higher education grants and youth grants spotlighted on the site . We were having a difficult time finding grants that would be appropriate for our school 's needs but once we started getting updates from their site we were much more successful . <p> We are looking to get a grant for our high school football team touchdown club . We are a group of parents who help raise money for the football team . We feed them before an away game and give them drinks and a snack after the game for the bus ride home , We also feed them after a home game and supply them with water and gatoraide during every game . We also give them drinks and fruit during football camp everyday for 2 weeks . At the end of the season we have a banquet for the players and there familes . So far this year are fundraising was not good and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts for the players , or for tropys . We also let our senior players keep there jersey they wore all year and we put there name on it . But the catch is we have to replace the ones they keep . And this year we have 21 seniors graduating . The most we ever had before was 7 at one time . So we may have to stop our tradition of the boys keeping there jersey and of out nice banquet . Thanks so much for your time . <p> Do n't forget the National Funding Information Center Libraries . There are approximately 250 of these libraries scattered around the U.S. that has tons of free resources on applying for grants , writing cover letters , finding resources , etc.

@@35478777 @4478777/ <h> Procedures Book : Your PTO 's Instruction Manual <p> Helpful information and resources to create policies and procedures books for your leaders . <p> by Christy Forhan <p> 08/11/2015 <p> Page 1 of 2 <p> Revised June 2015 <p> A little bit of long-term organization can prevent a lot of headaches . <p> For instance , say you 're appointed to chair the fall fundraiser . But the previous chairperson has moved away , and everybody else who worked on it in the past has gone on to a new school . Where do you start ? <p> Or you 're the newly elected treasurer . The previous treasurer gave you a stack of bills and the group 's checkbook , but no instructions about how to handle reimbursements . The carnival chair is asking for a cash box so she can make change ; how much should money should you give her , and in what denominations ? And for that matter , what do you need to include in the monthly treasurer 's report ? <p> Questions like these would be much easier to answer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , processes , procedures , and practices . It 's not hard to create decent procedures manuals , though it does take a little time and thought . The best approach is to create a separate three-ring binder for each major PTO officer or function . That might sound like a big job . The effort is worth it , however , to give your future members the most valuable tools in the PTO archives . <p> There are many important benefits that come from creating procedures manuals . First of all , the very act of documenting how your group operates will require your leaders to evaluate " and probably improve " the practices of your group . Creating a procedures book means that your PTO does n't have to reinvent the wheel every time there 's a leadership change . It also means all the hard work your leaders did and the knowledge you all gained will benefit the group after you 're gone . <p> When policies are documented , parent group leaders can use logic and precedent to deal with tough situations . Rules can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emotion or personal relationships . A procedures book can also transmit the values and time-honored traditions that are important to your group . Well-crafted procedures books can spare your future members the frustration , anxiety , and inefficiency that come from being tossed into a new situation with no life raft . <h> Getting Started <p> So how do you create a procedures book , and who gets one ? First of all , each of your major leadership positions should have their own procedures book . There will be some overlap in the information , but each book will also contain information specific to that job title : president , secretary , treasurer , fundraising chair , volunteer coordinator , etc . <p> Your procedures books do n't have to be fancy . They can be compiled in a simple loose-leaf , three-ring binder for ease in amending or copying the contents . As you build your procedures books , remember that these are different from the day-to-day files your officers need to do their jobs . The procedures books are reference books , to be read at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise . <p> Start with a copy of your group 's bylaws for each binder . Your bylaws are the foundation from which you grow the policies and procedures that help you carry out your mission . Everyone needs to understand the basic rules by which you govern yourselves . <p> Each binder should also include a robust description for that job . Even if you do n't have all the other parts ready to be assembled right away , build a basic book for each function , and enhance the books over time . <p> This is a wonderful suggestion . In our area , which is providing school assemblies to schools all over the country , we often see new volunteers coming in who have no idea what programs the school has had before . Hence they have no reference point for knowing which assemblies to look for the following year . Kids get bored seeing the same show every year . Leaving time between visits , even with a well loved show , is a good solution . However , knowledge of when to repeat great shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful records of which programs they have had and when , and also how those shows were liked by the school . So even if the PTO loses track we can come to their help . However , not many entertainers are so careful . A well kept record at the school with notations of what was liked and what was not is an invaluable tool to keep from re-ordering bad programs or over using good ones.Geoff <p> To B , PTO meetings should be open to all parents and/or guardians . Executive meetings are usually held for officers alone , but should be held seperately . At our school , if you are a parent and/or guardian , you are automatically a member of the PTO . See if you can get ahold of your PTO By-laws or seek the advice of your principal . I 'm not advising this necessarily , as I think you should exhaust all options , but I have heard of parents forming sub-committes , meaning a secondary PTO . Not sure what it would take to get it off the ground but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check into it . I wish you luck . <p> I am trying very hard to be an active member of our PTO but the president ( whose child will not be in the school next year ) is showing signs of staying on as an officer of the school . I could care less if I have a " title " or not but am being told that the only way you can be a part of the monthly meetings is if you hold a title on the PTO . They claim noone wants to help with anything but the sense I 'm getting is that it 's a direct result of this mother I referenced above being very overbearing and pushy with everyone including the staff and teachers at the school . Is it true that PTO meetings can not be attended by anyone other than the officers and what help can you give me to help myself and other parents that want to be involved in the school OUR KIDS are attending next year be more of an active participant in the decision making process at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was President of our school PTO . After a very ugly confortation from one of our teachers , I have resigned . My Vice President does not want to fill my shoes , what do I do now ? I do n't want ot leave the rest of the year just hanging , and there has not been any volunteers to step forward either . I care about the school and the children , but can no longer take the disrespect from the school staff . Please advise : sad : <p> I 'm looking to finish a book just like this for our group . The group has had the same President for 5 years and Treasurer for 8 years . However , both of them are moving on next year . Thinking a book would help the newcomers . Any suggestions-does anyone have a copy they can send me. alochbaumroadrunner.com <p> This is a terific site !

The National PTA sets a minimum age of 18 to be an officer , I believe . I do n't think there 's a limit on membership , however . PTOs are independent and can decide what rules make sense for them . We certainly have heard of groups where high school students have made a significant contribution . -- Craig

Nobody volunteers for PTO leadership out of a desire to fight with the principal . <p> If you have a great PTO-principal relationship , appreciate it and work to keep it strong . If you do n't , then now is the right time of year to start making it better . Have you sat down for a discussion with your principal about what she would like your PTO to accomplish this year ? Another great question is " What has our PTO or former PTO leadership done in the past that we can do better this year ? " Here you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of advance notice and approval she likes to have on things , etc . <p> Finally , my best tip is to do what you can to make your principal look good . Even if your principal does n't lift a finger to help with the fall fair , it does you no harm ( and potentially a lot of good ) to publicly thank her for her support of your efforts . As much as we 'd all love our principals to be superheroes -- great at all parts of their job -- some do n't excel at the involvement/public relations aspects of the position . We can either get really frustrated about that or unselfishly take steps to help the principal fill that gap .

Seriously , sorry for the wise-guy comment ( could n't resist ) , but I do n't think an appeal to the past is the way to go .

@@35478909 @4478909/ <h> Whose Rules , School or PTO ? <p> **31;129;TOOLONG <p> Collaboration between PTO and school is crucial to success , but it 's also important to know who has final say when disputes arise . <p> by Sandra Pfau Englund <p> 03/02/2017 <p> How much control does your local school board , superintendent , or principal attempt to exercise over the PTO ? Recently , I attended the first PTO meeting at my children 's new school . I was surprised to learn that the local board of education has issued rules attempting to regulate the operation of school parent and booster organizations . Some of the regulations make sense , but others may go beyond the legal authority of the school board and hamper the ability of the PTO to operate effectively . <p> If a PTO is a program of the school " it is set up and managed by the school " then the school may supervise and control the activities of the PTO . In such a case , however , the school also is liable in a legal sense for the activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are separately incorporated or that operate as independent , unincorporated associations of parents , the school has more limited authority . The school may supervise and control an independent PTO regarding the use of school facilities and the activities students engage in during school hours or as part of a school program . Beyond that , however , the PTO 's own rules " constitution or articles of incorporation and bylaws " should control . <p> One crucial note before we get into specifics . Principals and parent groups each hold considerable power to make the other 's work easy " and miserable . Know your group 's rights and stand up for them , but do it through discussion and negotiation . Divisiveness and animosity hurt the school and the children . You do n't want to create a situation like that whenever it can be avoided , and your principal should n't , either . <p> At my children 's new school the school board has set forth regulations , including these three : <p> The group must receive approval from the principal when planning functions in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be requested through the principal . <p> All items donated by parent or booster groups become the property of the school , and the school may use or later modify or sell those items . <p> These regulations are within the legal authority of the school . Any activity involving students , including distributing fundraising materials or PTO newsletters through the classrooms or organizing assemblies or other enrichment activities in which the students will participate , may be controlled by the school . In addition , any activity involving school facilities , such as an annual fall fair or other fundraisers , may require the approval of the school for use of the facilities owned and controlled by the school . <p> Also , items donated to the school become the property of the school to do with as desired . For example , it may upset PTO members to learn that computers they donated have been sold or used in the library rather than the classrooms designated by the parent group , but once the items have been donated , the PTO has no legal authority over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board go beyond its legal authority . <p> Parent and booster organizations must submit their annual fundraising plans to the school principal , and the plans then must be approved by the school board prior to the start of the school year . <p> The principal must approve and supervise all fundraising activities . <p> The mutual agreement of the principal is required prior to purchasing equipment , supplies , or materials for the school . <p> All funds of parent groups must be deposited in either FDIC or FSLIC institutions . <p> An outside audit of financial records must be conducted each year , and a copy of the report must be submitted to the principal and the school system 's finance officer . <p> Funds of any parent or booster group must revert to the school if the group dissolves . <p> Annual fundraising plans are submitted to the school board to ensure that multiple schools are not attempting to sell candy or wrapping paper at the same time . However , the rule also may hinder the local PTO if it comes up with a new fundraising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . <p> Legally , an independent parent group may raise funds for a school without anyone 's approval . The PTO can even state , without the school 's approval , that the funds are being raised to purchase new computers or a playground . The school may refuse the funds or items purchased with them , but it can not legally control the fundraising . So while cooperation is important to make sure the school wants the money raised or items purchased , sometimes schools attempt to exercise control beyond their legal authority . <h> Know Your Rights <p> Similarly , while depositing funds in secure banking institutions and conducting an annual audit are good financial practices , the school and school board have no legal authority to impose these regulations on the PTO . The school board may make suggestions regarding financial controls . However , the PTO has the authority to determine and implement its own financial practices . <p> In addition , the PTO may determine how its funds are distributed upon dissolution . Under IRS rules , organizations tax-exempt under section 501(c) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) groups upon dissolution . The school may be the logical recipient , or it may make sense to distribute the funds to a new or different parent or booster group . <p> Cooperation between any parent group and the school it supports is essential to carry out the mission of the PTO . However , as a PTO leader you should understand the extent of a school 's legal authority over your organization 's activities . This may allow you to make better and more informed decisions about the operation of your group . <p> Sandra Pfau Englund is an attorney specializing in legal issues for PTOs and other nonprofit organizations . <p> Hello . I am wanting to share at the independent PTO group 's meeting at my daughter 's elementary school the recent legal issues over the transgender s use ofbathroom , locker , shower rooms . The PTO board has blocked me and forbids me to state facts to inform parents because of this being a controversial issue and is out of step with their by-laws . So , I am wanting to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech that makes all parents aware of what is going on and has a direct impact on our school as we have transgender kids in our school.i thought the PTO was inclusive and set up to , among other things , inform parents of all info regarding the well fare of their children . As a parent , am I missing something here ? The board changes every two years and are we to be subject to the thinking of each new set of board members ? Thank you for help . <p> Our principal hand picked our board members for next year , he/she decided who would be president and vice president . The president has served over their term limit set by the bylaws and is her employee . Our bylaws state a term limit and there is to be a vote to decide board members . What power do I have to stop this ? What can I do ? <p> I was on the Board of our schools PTSO last year , and at the end of the year during our last meeting our Principal requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communication system the school was in desperate need for . Our board discussed , voted and approved for $3,000.00 to be given to the school to purchase this communication tool for the term of a 3 year contract . Since then a new PTSO Board has been elected and the Principal has decided to go a different , more expensive , less functioning , communication tool from our local school board . This is the same communication tool he Principal was against and why our Principal was rallying a vote to purchase a new communication tool . <p> As a past PTSO Board , what can we do about the funds not being used to purchase what our Board voted and Approved ? Can we call for another vote ? Is the principal required to refund the money as it is not being used as approved ? <p> We have 1 annual fundraiser - a winter dance . In fact , the PTO ONLY runs this dance at this point and donates the excess funds to the school . The dance was held in a church , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half price venue , but the admin. said we had to have it at the church or school . We are chose the school . We are paying the D.J.s , but the school admin. now says we must play New York New York ( we are located in Indiana ) and Donna Summer 's Last Dance at the dance . This is not the only thing they have told us we had to do . Our bylaws state that we operate under our bylaws and a district non-profit organization-but the bylaws are old . I can not find anyone who has even heard about this organization , nor have I been given a copy of its bylaws . We fill out the IRS form specifically for our PTO each year for the fed . and state governments . Is the admin. acting legally ? Can they tell a non-profit what to do outside of school hours ? <p> Hello , We are a school photo company and were told by the school district that we could solicit last spring and would be allowed on the bid list this fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We are not a small company and have business in three states . To make a long story short the district kept putting us off and finally we had to tell the schools we were still not on the bid list . Two schools pulled out but the others where the PTO controlled photos said they could ignore the district . We checked in further and got the same response for the head of the PTO in our state . We decided to go ahead and do the school photos at the schools run by the PTO . However , today we got an angry email from the District telling us we are not allowed back in the schools . We are confused . Who is correct here ? The PTO or the School District ? The PTO here does n't seem to care for the district . Any suggestions are welcome . Thanks <p> This is definitely troubling . It 's important for a PTO to be transparent in its finances -- anyone in the position of auditor should know that . Several thousand dollars is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several issues , but one of them is that if people feel you 're not being careful with money , you 'll have a much harder time raising funds . <p> Also , the treasurer should certainly not be writing checks for thousands of dollars that have n't been approved by the board or at least by the president . It 's important to make sure , in no uncertain terms , that she understands that . Even if she 's just trying to help , it 's not her prerogative to make that kind of decision . Maybe you should , as one measure , start requiring two signatures on every check . <p> Our Charter school fundraiser and also the PTO board auditor , spent a few thousand dollars which was n't approved on a small fundraising event and refused to present any receipt on his spending ? And he has no problem getting the money even that was n't approved because he has the board treasurer on his side . <p> hi everyone , recently in our Presidential Council meeting ( 11 schools represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item was brought up that was n't on the agenda . The Superintendant of the district asked one of the Presidents to ask if we would pool fundraising money to the sum of $200,000 to help with implementing Google Chrome in the elementary and middle schools . It was n't on the agenda and there was no paperwork and the discussion was vague . To say this was sneaky by the district is an understatement . Should PTOs be allowed to fundraise for something a district should provide ? We are all furious ! Help--we need some guidance . We are in Illinois where our state is completely messed up which does n't help anything ! <p> Our high school 's principal has stated unequivocally that students may not participate in our independent PTO fundraisers , specifically car washes and bake sales off campus even though these events are not during school hours . Our parents believe the school has no right to stop participating and supervising parents from allowing their children to participate in baking cookies , washing cars , or just being at the car wash with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent from involving the child if the student really wants to wash cars . Is the school overstepping its legal authority to forbid family participation in fundraisers ? <p> A year and a half ago , our Parent Teacher Group went through all the process to become a 501(1)c . We have , naturally , by-laws , the state cerification letter , the IRS non-profit approval ... but our principle just yesterday shut us down because she , and she actually said this on the phone to me , she " ... does n't like these ladies . They will not give her what she needs . " So , because she does n't like that the PTG would n't write her checks over the summer for items not approved by the members to purchase , she told us we could n't have meetings . This morning the district offices call supporting the principles decision . ? I do n't ... where do they ... are they serious ? UGH ! Where do we go from here ? Nothing outside the by-laws was done by the vp or pres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prinicple wanted .

These are the tried-and-true games and activities that schools rely on year after year . <h> Games With Prizes <p> Cakewalk : This is an easy , beloved activity that utilizes volunteers and often works as a lucrative fundraiser . Parents make or buy single-serving sweet treats such as cupcakes or bags of cookies . With music playing , kids walk around a course marked with numbers , stars , or pictures . The person standing on a marked spot when the music stops gets a prize . If some volunteers donate more elaborate cakes , designate a special picture as the spot that gets to claim the bigger prize . <p> Ring toss : There are many variations on this simple classic .

If you 're ambitious , provide a map to go with the list . <p> Obstacle course : Your PE teacher might be able to help you set up a challenging yet doable obstacle course . Use a timer and post the names of students who get through the course the fastest . <p> Maze : Parent groups have made mazes out of every conceivable object , including boxes , plywood , and bales of hay . Reach the end and get a prize . <p> Pick a door : Kids roll a foam dice or randomly choose a door to open to receive a surprise prize . An alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sewing numbered pockets onto heavy material . <p> Mini golf : Set up a golf course with different degrees of difficulty for students of different ages . Be creative and enlist kids to help design the course . <p> Basketball : This one could n't be easier . Just set up a hoop and round up some basketballs . The older the child is , the farther back he has to stand . Another variation is to toss a football through a spare tire . For a fun twist , some parent groups use a toilet seat for a hoop and toilet paper for a ball ! <p> Football toss : - Let kids try to score a touchdown by throwing a football through a- wooden cutout . For added fun , decorate the board with the logo or team colors of a favorite high school , college , or professional team . <p> Bowling : Set up plastic pins in a long hallway . Have the kids roll different size balls to try to knock down as many pins as they can . <p> Lollipop pull : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lollipop from the tree . If the bottom of the lollipop stem has been colored with a marker , the student can receive an additional prize . <p> Candy in a haystack : Instead of a needle in a haystack , try individually wrapped candies or small prizes . Some groups hide the loot in shredded newspaper , pine straw , or sand instead of hay . Set a timer , giving each child about 15 seconds to see how much she can find . <h> Activities Without Prizes <p> Face painting : This is such a hit that the line can get long . Some schools switched to temporary tattoos , which can be applied by parents and older kids to keep the line moving faster . Fancy fingernail painting has also gone over well at some schools . <p> Hayride : If you 're lucky , you can recruit a parent with a tractor .

Some groups have bought their own bounce house to use every year . Others rent one . Make sure you get a good quality bounce house and have ample supervision . <p> Karaoke : All you need is a karaoke machine , a stage , and a couple of attention-loving kids to get the singing started . <p> Active video games : Kids love playing musical video games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band . Some parent groups have rejected this and other types of video games because they want their carnival to stay low-tech . Other groups say these types of games are just too much fun not to include . Dance Dance Revolution is another popular and active video game that works well for a carnival . <p> Dance party : Set up a stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hits . Children can be shy at first , so you might need to recruit some outgoing students to get the party started .

Crafts do n't need to be complicated and should allow for some free-form creativity . <p> Police car or fire truck : Enlist your local firefighters and police officers to visit your carnival . Kids will love seeing these local heroes , and the officers can hand out informational brochures to parents . Your police department might even bring along its trained police dogs . <p> Pony rides : The pony may not walk very fast , but for many kids it 's still a thrill to get to ride one . <p> Petting zoo : Contract with a reputable company , farm , or zoo to safely run this activity .

If you 're having trouble building involvement , the problem might be that you 're not making the right argument . You simply need better ammunition . <p> A common way to think about getting people involved is to counter their objections .

At trunk or treats , costumed children walk through a parking lot , stopping at cars that have decorated trunks and receiving candy . <p> If your PTO is thinking about holding a trunk or treat event , here are the details you 'll need to consider . <h> Scheduling <p> Many parent groups choose to have their trunk or treat events- shortly before- Halloween , but not on Oct. 31 , when families may want to trick-or-treat in their neighborhoods or attend other community events . It 's common for schools to hold trunk or treat events on the Friday or Saturday before Halloween . Another option is to hold the event in mid-October and choose a harvest or fall theme . <h> Planning <p> When choosing a time , consider if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold the event during daylight hours or plan to set up floodlights . <p> Ask parents planning to decorate their cars to register in advance . This will give you an idea of how much space you need to reserve for vehicles and allow you to provide instructions or guidelines to them in advance . <p> Ask vehicle participants to decorate their cars according to a theme and suggest that they wear a costume that goes with it . They might go with a Halloween theme and fill their trunk with mummies or pumpkins . Other popular choices include decorating with children 's TV or movie characters or setting a scene , like the old west or a campsite . <p> If your event will last several hours , be sure to find out if you can have access to the school restrooms . Coordinate with the appropriate staff person to make sure the doors are unlocked and locked at the proper times . <h> Setup <p> Allow an hour for cars to set up before the festivities begin . Have someone on-site to direct cars to parking spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles to help space out the trick-or-treating crowd . <h> Candy <p> Estimate how many trick-or-treaters will attend and how much candy will be needed . Some parent groups purchase all the candy to be handed out . You may also ask people with decorated trunks to bring candy for 100 , for example , and then restock them when they run out . <h> Fun and Games <p> At many trunk or treat events , people who decorate their cars are asked to set up small , carnival-type games for kids to play , such as a ring toss or shooting a foam basketball . The games should be short and easy enough for young children to play . Children who win the game can be given small prizes or extra candy ; however , all children should receive candy at each station , regardless of how they did on the game . <p> For more fun , consider adding a face-painting station , a craft station with a simple project , or a- photo booth . <h> Contests <p> At some events , awards are given for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award categories , like creepiest trunk or a people 's choice award . <p> Costume contests are also popular . You can gather trick-or-treaters together and have the crowd applaud for their favorite costumes . An alternative to a costume contest is to gather together all the children wearing a similar costume , such as princess dresses . Take photos of the groups of princesses , pirates , or superheroes and share the photos with families on the school bulletin board , on Facebook , or in your newsletter . <h> Food <p> If your trunk or treat event is in the middle of the afternoon , there 's no need to provide food . If your event will be around a meal time , you may want to have volunteers grill hot dogs or hamburgers for hungry trick-or-treaters and their parents . <p> Whether you serve food or not , it 's a good idea to provide cups or bottles of water . All that candy will make people thirsty ! <h> Cleanup <p> Provide trash cans in several locations for attendees to place empty candy wrappers or used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up their own space .

@@35478943 @4478943/ <h> Boost Meeting Attendance <p> Do you struggle to get people to come to meetings ? The problem might be publicity or timing " or it might be the meetings themselves . <p> by Evelyn Beck <p> 07/28/2016 <p> Meetings are like funerals , says humorist Dave Barry : " You have a gathering of people who are wearing uncomfortable clothing and would rather be somewhere else . The major difference is that most funerals have a definite purpose . Also , nothing is ever really buried in a meeting . " <p> Since most people view meetings as a form of slow torture , it 's not surprising that parent groups face enormous challenges in getting parents together for such a purpose . Luckily , meetings are not the only thing parent groups do . Neither are they the most important activity of parent groups . With so many demands on their limited time " and the perception that meetings are a waste of that time " parents often choose to bypass these traditional powwows . While poor attendance can feel like failure , the most successful parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , building parent involvement in other activities can be much more effective than trying to lure everyone to sit through monthly recitations of the minutes , the treasurer 's report , and other agenda items . <p> Still , it 's good for parents to feel that they have a stake in the group and a voice in its decisionmaking " and meetings are one way to accomplish that . So here are some ideas for boosting the numbers at your next meeting . <h> Vary the Meeting Time <p> Surveys are one way to discover what times best suit your population ; variety is often appreciated . To accommodate its parents ' schedules , Shrewsbury Elementary in Shrewsbury , Pa. , now holds meetings on rotating days : Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , or Thursday . Coolidge Elementary in Wyckoff , N.J. , holds evening meetings in October and March , with morning meetings the rest of the year . And its morning meeting time was recently moved from 9:30 to 9:15 , allowing just enough cushion for parents to arrive after the morning rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a cup of coffee and socialize , and within an hour or so they 're on their way , " says PTO President Jeanine Rossi , adding that most of her school 's parents have flexible schedules because they either do n't have jobs or work part time or from home . <h> Vary the Meeting Place <p> Just as Tuesday night is n't necessarily the best day for meetings , neither is the school cafeteria the only place to conduct parent group business . Diverse locales , while perhaps not as central , offer other appeals . For example , South Jacksonville Elementary School in Jacksonville , Ill. , meets at a skating rink ; while kids skate for an hour , parents make decisions about upcoming events . The result is that attendance at the monthly meetings has increased from five people to 50 . <p> Some schools hold one or more gatherings a year at a local restaurant . That technique has worked for Macedon Elementary in Macedon , N.Y. , and Arthur J. Gallagher Neighborhood School in Harmony , Fla. , among others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer potluck dinner meetings at parents ' homes , with the schedule set and promoted before school let 's out for the summer . The PTO at Evergreen Elementary in Mosinee , Wis. , plans to hold an informal back-to-school potluck lunch in a park for its kickoff meeting in August . <h> Encourage Attendance as a Responsibility <p> Some parents respond to direct appeals by teachers or the parent group about the importance of their presence at meetings . For instance , each mom or dad who accepts the role of class parent at Coolidge Elementary is required to attend PTO meetings . This helps information flow back to other parents and also helps involve parents who might not otherwise attend , Rossi says . <p> At Shelburne Community School , the PTO has lobbied teachers to encourage attendance . " We talked with all the teams and teachers in the school and heavily recommended that they have parent representation coming to the meeting , " says PTO Chairwoman Mary Catherine Jones . The result is that each team has a parent position called " PTO Representative , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a different parent attending the meeting each month . The benefit for the teachers is consideration for classroom grants , ranging from $200 to $5,000 , awarded each year by the PTO . <p> " We tried to indicate that PTO meeting attendance by parents from teachers ' teams would be a factor in our giving grants during the year , " Jones says . " The more information we have about a team and its needs , the more likely that we would approve a grant . We do n't literally tie approval to attendance , but teachers need someone there to advocate their interests . " The result is that turnout has risen from about a half-dozen attendees to as many as 30 , and Jones feels sure that the difference is what she calls the PTO 's " vigorous lobbying of teachers to send representatives . ' Ironically , the teachers themselves rarely attend meetings except to present their grant requests . <h> Make Meetings More Fun <p> " I 've been told PTO meetings are boring , " says Katie Jones , PTO president at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's considering to change that perception is a " Bunko night " instead of a regular meeting . Half the parents would come at 4 p.m. and half at 6 p.m. to play Bunko , a lively game involving dice . At Coolidge Elementary , the last PTO meeting of the year is a thank-you brunch for parents , with only a brief meeting and the announcement of new officers taking a back seat to socializing . Sometimes all that 's needed is a change of terminology . Lansdowne Elementary in Charlotte , N.C. , stopped calling its monthly PTO meetings " board " meetings . " We took the word ' board ' off to make parents feel welcome , " says Copresident Jeff Highfill . <p> Another approach is to invite guest speakers or have students perform . The guest speakers at Coolidge Elementary are the school 's less visible faces , people not everyone would know , like the guidance counselor and the resource teacher . " This gives parents an opportunity to come and meet these people , " Rossi says . " We advertise each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and name to some of these people so if in the future they come across them , parents will be more comfortable . It 's especially helpful for our new families . " In addition , a different grade level of students makes a presentation each month , such as reciting poems they 've written , and parents are notified ahead of time when their children will be performing . <p> Of course , that does n't always work . One middle school parent sharing her experience on the message boards at ptotoday.com wrote , " I recall that the night the cheerleaders performed , the cheerleaders far outnumbered the adults present . So most of those parents must have just dropped the girls off at school and picked them up later . " <h> Give Prizes <p> Sometimes door prizes or awards bring people in . At each PTO meeting at Cracker Trail Elementary School in Sebring , Fla. , one attendee wins a $25 gift certificate to a local restaurant or the mall . Marengo Elementary used to award two $20 Wal-Mart gift certificates based on meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to a grades 4-6 teacher , to buy classroom supplies . But since the same teachers usually won , the approach is being tweaked . This year , parents will submit their child 's name at each meeting . At the end of the year , there will be one drawing , with $50 gift certificates going to one boy and one girl . <h> Offer Baby-sitting and Other Services <p> Make it easier for parents to attend by eliminating reasons why they ca n't , especially when it comes to childcare . Woodrow Wilson Elementary School in Framingham , Mass. , offers translation services at PTO meetings for parents who do n't speak English . The school also offers baby-sitting , as does Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville , Fla . Coolidge Elementary PTO pays two parents to baby-sit in a nearby classroom at each meeting , and that option is mentioned in all monthly PTO reminders . Evergreen Elementary in Mosinee , Wis. , pays the son of a former PTO president and his friend to baby-sit . <h> Make Meetings Shorter <p> Who is n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid meetings that go on and on ? That 's why a reputation for concise meetings might boost attendance . <p> Shrewsbury Elementary PTO cut its meeting time to an hour by eliminating unnecessary discussion about details . " It used to be someone would describe an event and say , ' Do you think we need to order potato chips ? What about napkins ? ' " says PTO President Andrea Senn . " But committees do n't need to come to the whole PTO . I told each chairperson , ' You decide for your event . ' I delegate more . There 's no time to get into the nitty-gritty at a PTO meeting . " <p> Coolidge Elementary keeps its meetings to an hour or 75 minutes . " That 's one of the factors that has increased attendance " the length of the meeting , " Rossi says . " I feel everyone has busy lives , and if the meeting is drawn out , they may not attend . It 's not that I skip anything . I 'm very organized . If discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me after the meeting so we can have a more in-depth conversation . " <h> Hold Fewer Meetings <p> Monthly meetings are a tradition that some schools have decided needs to go the way of all-male military colleges . Lakeside Middle School in Anderson , S.C. , holds only three PTO meetings per year " in September , November , and January . Shrewsbury Elementary also got rid of monthly meetings . " It was getting to be too much to do , and we were not getting anything out of it , " Senn says . " Every other month worked better . I 'm not a proponent of having a meeting just to have a meeting . " During those non-meeting months , the PTO holds a family event instead , such as a dessert social or an arts-and-crafts night . <p> Beall Elementary in Frostburg , Md. , also cut back to three meetings per year : in the fall , at midyear ( January ) , and at the end of the year . " We found out we had a lot better attendance when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Butch Bowersox . " With everybody as busy as they are , it 's almost worthless to try to get them all out for a meeting that did n't have a lot of content . That 's why we scaled back . We realize people 's time is important . For most it 's a relief " one less thing off their calendar . And it 's a huge help for us to have better participation . " <h> Combine Meetings With Other School Events <p> At Marengo Elementary , attendance at regular PTO meetings is small " only about 10 parents and teachers . But when the meeting is held in conjunction with a school event , attendance doubles or even triples . " We have a big turnout when we have an open house night because all the parents are there anyway , " says Katie Jones , who adds that meetings are also held after the science and book fairs . The PTO has also experimented with simply having a presence at open house rather than holding an actual meeting . The group sets up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ideas for increasing parent involvement or sign up to volunteer at the fall festival . <p> Every PTO meeting at Third Ward Elementary in Elkins , W.Va. , is held in conjunction with another event such as a dinner , cakewalk , book fair , or performances by the choir and band . At Lansdowne Elementary , a shortened PTO meeting is held immediately preceding school concerts . " It 's a captive audience , " Highfill says . " It gets a lot of people updated , but no discussion is generated . Its an effective form of announcing things . " <p> Last year , Beall Elementary decided to couple PTO meetings with events such as band concerts and movie nights , and attendance has nearly doubled . " We have more people willing to come out for events , " Bowersox says . " I 'm not sure if they 're coming out for the PTO meeting or for the event , but for parents it 's great to kill two birds with one stone . Food helps , too ; a lot of our events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTO meeting at Chatham Middle School in Chatham , Va . Brief meetings are held before band concerts , open houses , and family nights . <h> Publicize <p> Parents with full appointment books need a heads-up about meeting dates . Marengo Elementary has meetings listed on a school calendar magnet and on the school sign and also sends out reminders a week or two ahead of time . Shrewsbury Elementary goes even further : The PTO publicizes its meeting dates through a newsletter , website , school calendar , and district TV station . And on the day of a meeting , teachers put little round stickers that say " PTO meeting tonight " on the children before they leave . <h> Use Other Vehicles To Get the Word Out <p> If your PTO meetings still are n't standing room only , do n't despair . Communicate the necessary information to parents through newsletters and websites . Then focus on drawing parents in for the fun family events that will keep them coming back . Make creating and sending group emails ( and managing all those addresses ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free parent group email tool . <p> Thank you ! I was worried I was out of line wanting to give out pens and magnenets with the Schools name and our PTO website . But I thought it was something that might keep people coming back , getting a chance at their kids " doorprizes " . Thank you for letting me know that I am on the right track . <p> We have monthly board meetings to do the " nitty-gritty " detailed planning and then once a month , we hold a general , SHORT ( about 15 minutes ) meeting just prior to a family night event ( family reading night , family math night , winter break music program , etc. ) to get the " formal " stuff out of the way . We make announcements about upcoming events , board meetings , treasurer 's reports , requests for volunteers , etc. and keep it a minimum . We have had almost every parent in attendance this way !

@@35478974 @4478974/ <h> Combating Childhood Obesity With Physical Play Opportunities <p> Recess and physical education make a difference for students ' long-term health . <p> by Pei-San Brown , John A. Sutterby , and Candra D. Thornton <p> 01/22/2014 <p> The greatest health risk facing children today is not a terrible disease such as Leukemia or unthinkable trauma such as abuse . It is obesity . Recent statistics show that the number of obese and overweight children is increasing . The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the percentage of elementary-age children who are considered obese has doubled since 1980 , from 7% to 14% . Generally , children who are between 10 and 20% over the appropriate weight for their height and age would be classified as overweight . Children who are 20% or more over the ideal weight are classified as obese . About 85% of obese children continue to be classified as obese for the rest of their lives . These health risks are frequently found in higher concentrations among populations of minority and low-income children . The impact of obesity on these children may be exacerbated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation centers and are more likely to live in high crime areas . <p> Obesity is more than just a cosmetic concern . Short- and long-term physical and psychological concerns can result from childhood obesity . It has been linked to shorter life spans and a number of health factors that can affect children including Type II diabetes , cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure , stress on bones and lungs , high cholesterol , joint disease , irregular menstrual cycles , stroke , gall stones , gout , sleep apnea , and possibly cancer . Furthermore , obese children are often teased and discriminated against , and psychological effects of can include feelings of inadequacy , low self-esteem , and embarrassment . People who remain obese as adults are often discriminated against with regards to jobs and relationships . <p> Children who are obese are more likely to become adults who are obese . As children get older , this possibility increases . By the time obese children reach the age of 6 years , their probability of becoming obese adults is more than 50% . Obese adolescents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having one obese parent also increases the possibility that obese children will become obese adults . <p> Obesity is the end result of an inversely proportional relationship between activity level and caloric intake . Children who take in more calories than they burn become obese and less physically active . These children experience physical activities differently from non-obese children . Rigorous physical play is difficult and they are often physically inept . In a recent study investigating the developmental progression of young children 's overhead ladder usage , approximately 120 children ages 3 to 10 were observed traversing the apparatus . Although obesity was not an objective of the study , it was noted that the only children who were unable to successfully navigate the equipment were obese . Another study reveals that obesity also is an influence on children 's walking patterns . Obese children generally walk slower , are flat footed , walk with turned out toes , and walk asymmetrically . These poor walking habits have the potential to impose cumulative consequences such as body tissue damage and structural deformities . <p> When considering ' solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in obesity must be considered . These include genetics , emotional stability , hormone levels , and intake-activity relationships . For the majority of people involved with children , the intake-activity relationship is the only factor with which it is possible to engage . And of that factor , only the ' activity ' aspect is within reach . But increasing the physical activity level among children is complicated . Schools , under pressure to increase test scores , are decreasing children 's opportunities to participate in recess and physical education ( PE ) . In fact , the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) reports that PE classes are disappearing from schools in the United States , as evidenced by the drop in percentage of schools that have PE programs . In the 1990 's alone , the percentage of schools that offer PE classes dropped from over 40% to around 25% , and that number is still on the decline . As a result , schools are increasing the amount of time children 's bodies remain relatively stationary . Reductions in the amount of physical activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found that children who were not engaged in a PE program at school gained 1 inch more around the waist and 2 pounds more overall than those who were involved in a PE curriculum . <p> Children are not compensating for this lost physical activity time by increasing their physical activity level after school . In fact , they may also engage in sedentary activities after school . More and more , children 's free time is consumed with sedentary activities like watching television and playing computer games . Researchers have reported direct correlations between the amount of television watching and obesity . The sedentary habits found in our schools and homes may be compounding the growing number of obese bodies . <p> A promising area for increasing physical activity is through improving children 's access to areas where they can have high rates of challenging physical activity . A recent study published in Pediatrics suggests a direct link between physical activity and the environment to which children are exposed . The CDC in 1998 sent out a call for an increase in environments that encourage physical activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that children get 30 minutes of vigorous cardiorespiratory exercise at least 3 times a week . <p> Studies also show that physical stature largely dictates in which activities children can participate and what areas of play environments are accessible . Thus , it becomes a responsibility of playground designers to provide challenging activities for obese children who are not as physically adept as their non-obese peers ; as a result , they will have opportunities to be physically active during play times . Responsibility also lies with parents to advocate for instilling sufficient recess and physical education times during the course of the school day . Furthermore , children who participate in physical education programs and/or have access to community recreation areas are more likely to be physically active . Increasing opportunities for challenging active play , physical education , and recess , as well as the development of community recreation centers in low-income areas , may have an important impact on the greatest health risk facing our children today . The AHA recommends requiring PE classes for K-12 students , encouraging extra-curricular activities that promote and increase physical activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for obesity in children . Regular physical activity can help control blood lipid abnormalities , diabetes and obesity . Aerobic physical activity can also help reduce blood pressure and reduce the obesity in children . Children should follow a regular and manageable daily routine and should take modest regular exercise under the supervision of a physician or physical therapist. 
@@35478976 @4478976/ <h> Preventing Theft : Why It 's Crucial <p> Theft from PTOs and PTAs does n't happen because there 's a criminal in your midst . It happens because need meets opportunity " opportunity you can and should prevent . <p> by Michelle Bates Deakin <p> 05/01/2015 <p> Last year , the Hampstead Elementary School PTA in Maryland had two goals : to replace the schools aging playground equipment and to install a state-of-the-art wireless computer lab . Toward those ends , children tromped through the rural town hawking candles and drumming up participants for runathons , all contributing to a $60,000 take to fund the climbers , swings , and keyboards . <p> Little did the children or their parents know , however , that as fast as the money was coming in , it was going out . In July , just as the PTA 's treasurer was finishing his two-year term , he was arrested for stealing more than $62,000 from the organization . The staggering loss has put the school 's long-awaited projects at risk . The situation at Hampstead is an example of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embezzlement . <p> Principal Monica Smith told a local newspaper that when she had to tell her fundraising committee chairs about the embezzlement , they looked like someone had died . " There was shock , sadness , and now when I talk to them , they 're angry " and they have every right to be angry , " she said . <p> That anger is fueling local prosecutor Melissa Hockensmith , who 's handling the case , in which John N. Biggs faces 39 charges of theft . " The kids earned this money , and there 's a good lesson we can show them , " says Hockensmith . " You ca n't take someone 's hard-earned money and just get away with it . " <p> There 's a good lesson for parent groups to learn , as well . Embezzlement is a fact of life . " This problem is pervasive , " says veteran fraud investigator Joseph Whall , managing director of the Whall Group in Auburn Hills , Mich. , who 's seen cases in everything from church groups to multinational corporations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandals that run into the billions of dollars , volunteer groups have to recognize the risks to their own organizations . Any group that comes into contact with money , whether it 's a Fortune 500 company or a PTO , needs to safeguard its assets . Clear bylaws , sound policies and procedures , and consistent checks and balances are essential for even the smallest of PTOs . Some groups have developed these plans in the wake of financial scandals at their schools . Others have had the foresight to head off problems by developing the policies before a crisis occurred . Leaders in both situations agree that it is easier to create the practices before a loss happens than it is to explain to the children that their money has disappeared . <h> The Fraud Triangle <p> Fraud is as common as a virus and can be just as menacing . Like illness , you can take all the precautions against it and still get sick , but you can substantially reduce your vulnerability . <p> In the 1950s , a sociologist named Donald R. Cressey developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle " is still the most widely accepted explanation for what motivates seemingly trustworthy people to embezzle . The three points of the triangle are motive , opportunity , and rationalization . <p> First , a person needs to have a motive or need . That could range from trouble making mortgage payments to envy of the PTO president 's new Lincoln Navigator . " Statistics show that given the opportunity , a large percentage of American people will take advantage of the opportunity to embezzle , provided they have the motivation , " Whall says . " It could be troubles from a divorce or drug or alcohol abuse . In one case I had , it was jealousy over the size of a desk . " <p> Second , the person must have a tempting opportunity . It could be while she is collecting admission fees to the PTO 's fall festival , counting the proceeds alone , or balancing the PTO 's books with no one looking over her shoulder . <p> The last leg of the triangle is rationalization : a way to make the theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might take money during one financially troubled month so he can pay his mortgage , with every intent to pay the money back next month . However , next month his finances are n't any better , so he takes a little more and tells himself he 'll pay it back next month . And so on . Another form of rationalization is to believe that the money wo n't be missed , such as , " It 's only $100 , and we 're earning so much at this auction . " <p> The most successful fraud-fighting tactics dismantle one of the legs of the fraud triangle . PTOs ca n't do anything about members ' personal financial needs , but they can remove the temptation to steal by eliminating situations in which any one person will be alone with money and by ensuring that multiple sets of eyes are always watching the books . <p> " You have to have fiscal controls and checks and balances so no volunteer is ever out there alone handling large sums of money , " says Helen Little , an association consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volunteers : How To Get Them , How To Keep Them . <h> Checks and Balances <p> There are a variety of fiscal controls and checks that PTOs have implemented to stave off thievery . In addition , organizations are using insurance , along with just plain common sense , to make sure all the money they 're raising for schools is going where it is intended . <p> Require two signatures on every check . No one person should have the authority to issue PTO checks . At the Northwest Elementary School PTO in Pflugerville , Texas , all checks must carry the signature of the treasurer and the signature of the PTO president or the principal . " The policy helps the treasurer , " says past President Joy Hall Bryant . " She can tell people , ' No , I ca n't just write you a check . ' " <p> Use financial request and reimbursement forms . Similarly , no PTO member should be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses and no bills should be paid until a member fills out a form detailing what the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we approve in a meeting that were going to buy 15 microscopes , when the invoice comes in , somebody still has to fill out that cover form and put it with the invoice , " Bryant says . <p> Implement cash controls . Do n't put money in Tupperware containers . Do n't let members take money home . And ideally , do n't even leave cash at school overnight . These may seem like common-sense rules , but they are routinely violated by tired volunteers who are closing up an evening event and just want to go home without counting up the money and making a bank deposit . <p> Another hard-to-follow but simple rule is to never leave people alone with money . " We always have two people present to receive cash , " says Bryant . That means two people sit at a table to sell tickets . And two people count the money at the end of an event . After the money is counted , each person signs a " funds received " form and puts the money in a locked box for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Arlington , N.J. , only board members are allowed to count cash . " If there 's a money problem , it 's the board members who are responsible , " says President Kim Costello . " Before we created that rule , there were way too many hands touching the money . " <p> Use tickets for cash events . To protect cash collected for admissions to events , it 's wise to issue a ticket to every person who attends . That makes it easier to count how many people came through the door and to project how much cash should be collected . Volunteer consultant Helen Little suggests collecting tickets in a fishbowl and choosing one or several to win a door prize . That encourages everyone to turn in their tickets and yields an accurate count . There will rarely be an even match between tickets sold and tickets collected because not everyone will turn in his ticket . However , if the cash has been collected accurately , there should be more money collected than tickets counted . If not , a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every group should have a finance committee that reviews all transactions monthly . Helen Little recommends this committee include the president and at least two board members . Each month , the committee should review bank statements for accuracy . <p> Conduct annual audits . Audits are essential to make sure all the numbers truly add up . At the Thomas Jefferson PTO , an audit committee reviews the books annually . Each year , the committee has at least three members who match every financial request form with every receipt . After the volunteer committee finishes its review , the books are then handed to a paid certified accountant who checks its work . <p> Write down the rules . Some PTOs have been hesitant to create or carry out cash controls because board members are nervous about offending volunteers . But clearly explaining policies and procedures in writing prevents people from feeling singled out or mistrusted . " We have a one-page form on cash policies and procedures , " says Bryant . " We can easily hand it to a volunteer , so they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " touchy " when her group first required financial request forms for any reimbursements . " Everybody said that they were n't going to take anything , " she recalls . " But we stressed that we needed the paperwork for the audit committee . That made people feel more comfortable . " <p> Get bond insurance . Even well-crafted cash controls and regular audits can not protect every PTO from theft . That 's where fidelity bonds come in . Fidelity bonds insure that if any money is stolen , it will be recovered . The most common bonds are $10,000 bonds . If a PTO had a $10,000 fidelity bond and $10,000 was embezzled , the bond would ensure that all the money would be replaced . Fidelity bonds also come in $25,000 and $50,000 policies . And even larger bonds can be written for groups that handle greater amounts of cash . <p> Some insurance companies insure specific PTO officers , such as presidents and treasurers . Some PTOs have balked at those policies because they require intense background and credit checks . Occasionally , elected officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign . Blanket policies , which cover anyone who comes in contact with money , do not require background checks of any members . Those policies also ensure that if a new officer is appointed midyear , the group does n't have to apply for a new fidelity bond . PTO Today 's insurance programoffers great rates on blanket insurance coverage for parent groups . <p> The Hampstead Elementary PTA did carry bond insurance . It had a $25,000 bond , which means that some of its $62,000 loss will be recouped quickly . Although the school 's computer lab project has been temporarily put on hold , the PTA is forging ahead with plans for the new playground . Several neighboring parent groups have offered to help out financially , and despite the group 's loss , the new climbers and swings are expected to be in place this fall . <h> Facts on Fraud <p> The average fraud scheme lasts 18 months before it is detected . <p> The most common method for detecting fraud in the workplace is through tips from employees , customers , vendors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovery is by accident . <p> The typical fraud perpetrator is a first-time offender .

It has been an equal-opportunity problem , striking groups from coast to coast . There have been dozens of cases just this year .

@@35478981 @4478981/ <h> What Should PTOs Pay For ? <p> dolgachov/Thinkstock <p> Tighter school budgets mean parent groups are asked to fund more and more items that used to be paid for by the administration . <p> by Sharron Kahn Luttrell <p> 04/28/2015 <p> Lauri Lewis thought she knew what to expect when she joined the PTO four years ago . She would help run bake sales , school fairs , and teacher appreciation days , right ? Well , yes . But she would also raise money for hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of equipment and capital projects . That got her wondering " what is the PTO 's role , anyway ? To enrich her kids ' educational experience , or to enrich her kids ' school ? <p> Increasingly , parent-teacher organizations are funding items that schools say they need but ca n't afford . Across the country , PTOs are picking up the tab for computers , library books , even instructor salaries and classroom aides . While most agree these items should be paid for with public funds , many PTOers say they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear . <p> Lewis , whose fifth- and seventh-grade children are students in the Brazosport Independent School District in Texas , was stunned her first year on the PTO when the parent group funded a new phonics curriculum . " I was like , ' What does the school provide ? ' - " she says . <p> Since then , Lewis has watched the district 's PTOs pay for a new elementary school track , 20 computers with wireless Internet , a computer lab , an outdoor pavilion for physical education classes , maps , an atomic clock , and library books for the middle school . <p> Earlier this school year , Lewis headed up the annual Rasco Middle School PTO fundraising drive , which brought in $50,000 through gift-wrap and candy sales . " It sounds absurd , but we almost had trouble spending the money . A teacher could have asked for almost anything , " Lewis says . " The schools that my kids go to are better equipped because of the PTO . I think the school board knows the PTO will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to National PTA President Shirley Igo . While it 's understandable " indeed commendable " that parents want to provide big-ticket items for their children 's school , it 's unfair to do so , she says . Private funds tip the balance of equity in public schools , with students in wealthier communities likely to end up with more than their peers in less well-off districts . " When some schools are able to raise additional funds from outside sources , while other schools are not , we develop a multi-tiered education system that places many of our children at a great disadvantage , " Igo explains . " No child 's education should depend on where he lives , his socioeconomic condition , or the ability of his community to add to his school 's resources . " <p> Others disagree , arguing that providing the best resources for their children ca n't be a bad thing . <h> A Budget Band-Aid ? <p> Private donations to public schools are not new phenomena , although lately , parent groups have edged into a more central funding role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted tax limitation measures , restricting the amount of money a community can raise for services like education . And with only 20 percent of American families having children in public school , support for increased education funding has fallen off , said S. Paul Reville , who is on the faculty of the Harvard School of Education and is co-director of Harvard 's Pew Forum on Standards-Based Reform . <p> Yet , from the prairie town pioneers who pooled their money to hire a schoolteacher , to the gifts of water fountains and ornamental trees that senior classes buy their schools each year , beneficiaries of public education have felt compelled to give something back . Add to that impulse dwindling public education dollars and the specter of a beloved child doing without , and you get someone like Kevin D. Green Sr. , who pounded the pavement in Jackson , Mississippi , to collect donations for the annual PTA raffle . Green , president of the Boyd Elementary School Parent Teacher Association , realized his third-grader would be on to middle school before Boyd got the " computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's schools . <p> So , with the same spirit that drives him to purchase Kleenex , soap , and other essentials for his son 's classroom , Green and the PTA set out to buy computers for the school . The raffle brought in $20,000 " a high for the Boyd PTA " and 11 new computers are expected to arrive any day . <p> " The PTA has given us a boost in getting up to date , " says Frederick Murray , principal of grades three through five in the 800-student Boyd school . Murray says the PTA 's generosity has allowed him to use district funds to reduce class sizes by hiring more teachers . <p> The children at Boyd do not come from wealthy families ; more than 95 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch . The $20,000 was hard-earned , through the students ' salesmanship and the community 's support . But some worry that one-time or annual fundraisers like this are a Band-Aid that covers the need for long-term , strategic funding and could lull school boards into ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations are , there will never be enough to pay for everything , says Wendy D. Puriefoy , president of the Public Education Network ( PEN ) , a national association of local education funds in Washington , DC . According to Harvard 's Reville , if the nation 's total charitable foundation dollars replaced public funding of education , America 's schools could survive for two to three days before plunging into bankruptcy . " People are trying to solve a big public problem with private money , and it just does n't work in the long run , " says Puriefoy . <p> The community 's enthusiasm for equipping schools should be redirected toward advocating for increased public funding , Puriefoy says . Not only do public dollars reflect the public 's priorities , but they also ensure consistency that most PTOs ca n't , she explains . The Rasco Middle School PTO has no long-term strategy because the school serves only two grades . The entire PTO changes over every few years . " There 's no long-range plan , " Lewis says . " Every couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , ' OK . How can we spend this money ? ' - " <p> Puriefoy 's advice is , " As a PTO , ask yourself the larger question : ' What happens after my kids are gone ? ' If something is going to have an impact , it has to be structured , regular , systematic . " <h> Parents as Philanthropists <p> The Gates Elementary School in Acton , Massachusetts , seems not to suffer from continuity issues . The school , which serves 508 students in grades K " 6 , has a PTO that has paid for a Spanish instructor for the last nine or 10 years . It also funds 39 hours per week of classroom assistants . Interim Principal Walter McGrail explains that the PTO has a sort of succession plan , where the co-chair serves with the chair for a time before taking over the helm . This ensures an uninterrupted link with the past . The PTO has avoided running afoul of the teachers ' union by limiting its support to part-time , noncertified positions . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund personnel , there are districts that are so concerned with the potential for problems that they have clear rules about what sort of help they will accept from parents . The Newton , Massachusetts , public schools have an " equity cap , " which limits the amount of money parent groups can donate for certain items . Technology was removed from the cap when budgets got tight , so last year the Mason Rice elementary school parent group launched a capital campaign after realizing that , of the city 's 15 elementary schools , its was among the most poorly equipped . Through letters , information nights , and coffees , the PTO raised $70,000 to buy computers and audio-visual equipment . This year , some of the city 's other PTOs tried to organize similar fundraisers , bringing inequity concerns back to the surface and sparking a movement to put technology back under the equity cap . <p> " We 're at loggerheads , " says Mason Rice PTO Co-Chair Kathy Berman . " But the point is good . I do n't support PTOs taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been meeting to work out the issue , and she hopes its members can figure out a way to make sure every school is equipped at the same level . <p> When Paul Houston was superintendent of the Princeton , New Jersey , public schools , he had a policy limiting parent support to nonessential activities , such as enrichment . Still , Houston , now executive director of the National Association of School Administrators , says he 's glad he was n't on the receiving end of an offer that a California rock star once told him about . The man ( whose name Houston , out of courtesy , wo n't reveal ) was unhappy with what he felt was the unhealthy food his child 's public school cafeteria served . The musician offered to hire a macrobiotic chef . When the superintendent told him that would n't be fair to the other schools in the district , he offered to give a benefit concert to pay for macrobiotic chefs for each of the schools . <p> " If I were the superintendent , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Houston says , then adds that he probably would have encouraged the parent to lobby the school board to allocate more funds toward healthier school meals . <p> That 's the advice Puriefoy has . And while parents like former Mason Rice PTO Co-Chair Bonnie Ciambotti agree that 's the best route , they 're acutely aware of the clock ticking on their children 's public school years . By the time they work their requests up through the bureaucratic layers , chances are their kids will be on to another school . " Our computers were so old and slow . The teachers were so frustrated , they could barely even use them , " Ciambotti says . " We knew if we waited for the school department to fund the computers , we just would n't get them . " <p> Whether or not it 's in society 's best interest to have parents acting as private philanthropists , one thing 's for certain : They 're not going to stop anytime soon . Dire needs and enthusiastic parents make for a potent mixture . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it ebbs and flows with the economy , " Houston says . " I think this will be coming up more often now . " <h> The PTO Today Take <p> It 's an age-old question : Where should we draw the line between a school or district 's financial responsibilities and the fundraising role of a parent group ? Like the bumper sticker says , " It will be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber . " <p> While we agree with that sentiment , the reality is that parent groups across the country are playing a key role in providing valuable extras for children " more than $2 billion worth of playgrounds and computers and field trips per year , at last count . That ca n't be a bad thing . <p> The most effective parent groups can aim for success in both areas . By reaching out and engaging your entire community in the education cause , you 'll make strides toward increased district-level funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " your next fundraiser will be even more successful . It does n't have to be an either-or proposition . <h> The I 's Have It <p> When S. Paul Reville was executive director of the Alliance for Education in Worcester , Massachusetts , he helped spearhead a $4.5 million tax override for the schools . Convincing taxpayers to support local education in a blue-collar city of 170,000 was the result of a long-term campaign of public engagement . <p> Reville says the PTO is a natural body to advocate for a higher level of school funding . He recommended parents embark on a basic " three I 's " marketing strategy of gaining the community 's interest , involvement , and investment in the schools . <p> Interest community members in the issues your school is facing by helping them make the connection between the community 's vitality and the health of the schools . According to a recent survey by the Public Education Network and Education Week , most Americans agree that the nation 's success depends on a well-educated citizenry . <p> Involve people in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited local policy makers into the schools to be principal for a day . Other ideas include recruiting senior citizen volunteers and hosting community reading days , during which local dignitaries and others visit classrooms as guest readers . <p> When people feel a sense of ownership in the public schools , they 'll be more likely to invest their time and tax dollars in education . <p> " It 's a different way for the PTO to think of its mission , " Reville says . " What you really should be about is getting critical people in your community interested in making a financial commitment . " <p> Before embarking on the three I 's , the PTO must educate itself about the issues its school faces . <p> Questions to ask are : What are the system 's learning goals for the children ? Are those goals being met ? If not , how will they be met ? Does the budget reflect these goals ? What resources do we have ? <p> " PTOs need to say , ' The work we have to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of life , ' " says Wendy Puriefoy , president of the Public Education Network . " Generally people know more about buying a car than they do about the way their child 's school system works . " <p> So , from the point of view of liberals , we should n't fund our own children 's schools because other schools do n't get funded equally . So , in their perfect world , all children should get crap education . But , the better off will then send their children to private schools or home school , etc . This will therefore destroy public education . There are schools , like our own , that have about 50% economically disadvantaged . They benefit from the other parents who give their blood , sweat and tears to the PTO . What would happen if the PTO could no longer fund enhancements ? The parents who could do so , would leave . Either by going to other school in the district , private education or home schooling . <p> While I agree that schools need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping my child 's school in order to make the government realize how badly schools need money . I have no desire to play a game of chicken with the government at the expense of my child 's education . In a perfect world all the schools would be equal , but we do n't live in a perfect world . I am not supposed to do something simply because it 's not fair to another school ? Are you kidding me ? It 's like deciding not to buy a new car because someone else ca n't afford it , even though you need one . <p> Just a quick question ! Should a school PTO pay for a principal 's dinner with his family , alcohol included , as an end of the year gathering ? As well as paying for dinner , it never got brought up at any meeting or approved ? What is the correct answer ? <p> JM -- It 's quite common for PTOs to provide funds and resources to teachers . Some groups do it in the form of grants based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each classroom . In general , you could say that anything that helps teachers do their jobs better benefits students . <p> You have to make a decision based on your own group 's resources about what you are comfortable funding . In general , I 'd say take strong guidance from the principal , but it 's perfectly OK to push back . You know better than he does how your resources match your needs and goals , and how much work is involved in any project . <p> It 's also important to limit the amount of fundraising you do . Running too many fundraisers will result in strongly diminishing returns , give your group a negative reputation , and make it difficult to build parent involvement . ( Not many people join a group that 's primarily all about fundraising . ) <p> This is my first time being part of the PTO and the first time that only parents are members , no teachers . From what I have learned , the PTO raises funds to provide items that the kids need , books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. and it comes from money the parents donate . Recently , the principal requested funds for items that will only benefit the teachers within the school but outside the classroom . I did not provide specifics , but a general answer would be appreciated . Thanks . <p> Our scholl principle asked our pto to fund these items below .... Should the pto money pay for teachers back to school lunch party , on aug. 8th 2012 ? Should the pto pay for teachers spirit wear t-shirts , to be worn on Fridays each week , for 65 teachers ? Should the parents be in charge of the parent drop off and pick up area and hand out tardy passes to those kids that come in late ? <p> Well performing schools usually gets less funding from the school district , so there already is an inequity . If you have a low-performing school in middle class area , the parents with means will put their children in private schools and leave the public school system . So , even more money will end up in this inequity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what parents can do and sacrifice for if they can make a difference between a 1-30 class size versus a 1-25 class size for kindergarten . <p> " Disgusted " just seems a bit strong to me on this issue . I see your point about good schools for all , but I simply ca n't paint as a bad or uncaring person the parent who digs deep from his or her own wallet or time to give to a school , any school . <p> Yes , I want all schools better . But that does n't make the parent who gives to one school somehow bad . And certainly not disgusting . On the spectrum of good parents and bad parents , the parent who gives time and money to any school is way on the good side . <p> Frankly , I 'm disgusted by the sentiment that parents should have the right to better their own public school while ignoring the less well-off schools . I agree with Shirley Igo that no child 's education should depend on where he lives . My family happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our city , but I believe that , as a parent , I have an obligation to ALL the children who live in this city , and I conduct myself and allocate my volunteer time accordingly . <p> What strikes me about these comments is that most of them are concerned with gifts for teachers . When did the focus get turned away from what is best for the students ? Is n't that why we 're here ? The PTA/PTO 's funds should only be used to enhance the education of the students , not to be a budget shortfall fix . More than likely , if you get to looking at the district 's budget , you 'll find there is more money than you think . Our school district cut off all " selling " fundraisers this year but was somehow able to find $15,000 for each elementary school to make up for it . We found that doing only cash for trash fundraisers ( Boxtops , Nestle labels etc. ) more than pays for the needs of our PTO.

Could you create a vibrant , yearlong after-school program that taps into the passions of all your parents and supplements the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases covered well but needs a more active social service component . Your PTO could take the lead on infusing your school with an ethic of sharing . <p> You 'll notice that my examples do n't include a laundry list of items that need to be purchased . There 's nothing wrong with parent groups helping provide tangible resources for the school , but I find that groups that make purchases their core mission continually struggle to gain support . In fact , the groups that are able to raise the most dollars for their school are usually the ones that focus on involvement , community , and service first and fundraising second . <p> Then again , if there 's no heat in the school or the kids are getting hurt on broken-down slides , then a new boiler or a new playground may be exactly what your school needs now . <p> I do find that most groups that really thrive list " grow parent involvement " somewhere within their goals .

That role is to help transform your school from a pile of bricks with books inside into a community where the kids know that they 're not alone . How you send that message " what you work on this year , what you work on next year , how you make the school a better place " is up to you and your membership . There 's no better cause .

Here are five smart practices for any parent group , whether your budget is $1,000 or more than $100,000. <h> 1 . Require Two Signatures <p> Can you write a PTO check on your own ? Do you need a second authorized signature ? No ? Then you are accepting an unnecessary risk and a big personal burden . Just one person has the power to spend the PTO 's hard-earned money . Now is the time to consider tightening up your PTO 's check-signing policy . Having two officers or , as in some PTOs , an officer and the principal , sign every check ensures that two leaders know " and accept the responsibility for " how the money is being spent . <p> Get together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signers . Then visit your bank . Update the account signature card , if necessary , to add the new authorized signers . The bank may also need to update your account record to reflect that two signatures are now required on your checks . The bank may allow you to start using a second signature with your current checks . In the future , when you need to reorder checks , you can request that the printer add a second signature line . In our PTO , the president , vice president , and treasurer are authorized to sign , though only two at once . <p> If you adopt this policy , it might be tempting to have an officer sign a few checks just in case . Do n't do that . Never sign a blank check , and never ask another officer to do so . It 's really bad practice . It means the officer is authorizing the expenditure of PTO funds without knowledge of the expense . This negates the dual signature control and places an unfair risk on the officer and an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trail <p> Have you had a conversation like this one ? <p> " Hey , PTO Treasurer ! Oh , I 'm so glad I caught you ( as you 're racing out of the grocery to get home in time for the bus ) . I 've been carrying these receipts around from the fall festival for a while , and I 've been meaning to drop them off to get reimbursed . They 're in here somewhere . Here they are . Thanks ! " <p> And you are handed a crumpled wad of receipts as your friend disappears into the produce section . <p> Here 's a different ending to this conversation . <p> " I 'll be glad to cut you a check . Just fill out a yellow Reimbursement Request Form and attach your receipts . I 'll send a form home with your daughter tomorrow or you can pick one up at the school . After you turn it in , I 'll mail you the check . " <p> And now the responsibility is where it belongs , on the volunteer 's shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the reimbursement . <p> Preparing a separate supporting document for each transaction might , at first , seem like overkill . After all , vendors provide paper invoices , and volunteers turn in paper receipts for reimbursement . Is n't that enough ? <p> Look at your files for the answer . Can you easily retrieve the receipt that supports a particular check ? Is it easy to figure out what activities generated the money in a certain large deposit ? Are the receipts and deposit tickets scrawled with notes or stapled to little scraps of paper ? Have you ever had trouble tracing transactions during your audit ? If so , you can benefit from paving the paper trail with standard control forms . <p> A paper trail for each transaction ensures traceability and visibility of every PTO dollar , develops historical information that is useful for future planning , facilitates your annual audit , and keeps your files neat . Plus , the information on the control form can remind you of the steps to properly complete the transaction : secure two signatures , assign budget category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use control forms for a while and they will naturally become part of your standard operating procedures . <p> There are three major financial transactions for which you can design a unique control form . All the forms should have a place for treasurer approval , date , budget category , and a place to check off that the transaction has been logged . The rest of the information varies based on the type of transaction . <p> Reimbursement Request . Include the requesters name , phone number , and address if you plan to mail the check . Add a place for a second officer approval , the check number , the check date , the amount , and reason for reimbursement . Remind the volunteer to attach the receipt to the form . <p> Check Request . Use this form when a check is needed in advance of the transaction , such as for an assembly or mail order purchase . Check requests are similar to reimbursement requests , but your form should include the check payee name and address of the payee . A completed check request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt coming your way . <p> Cash Receipt . After a money-generating event , your volunteers use a cash receipt form to record the money collected . The form should have a tally area by bill and coin denomination , along with a place to record checks and the check total . You can staple the banks deposit ticket to the control form after the money is deposited . <p> I use control forms like these and find they work best for me when I copy each type onto a different color paper . If I see a yellow form in my treasurer binder , I know I have a reimbursement request to process . If there 's a pink form , I need to prepare a check . And if I am carrying a green cash receipts form , I 'm on my way to the bank . <p> I like the color forms for my own ease of filing and also so I can direct a volunteer to the proper form by color , not just by title . I use 25 to 50 of each type each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 3 . Report Monthly <p> Every month , that 's 12 in all , the treasurer should prepare a report of financial activity for the executive board and members . If activity is reported every month , it is less likely that a surprise will catch the PTO off guard or short of cash . <p> Robert 's Rules of Order recommends a monthly report showing the balance at the beginning of the month , plus receipts ( cash in ) , and less disbursements ( checks out ) , with the ending balance at the bottom . If your parent group operates under a preapproved annual budget , your standard report might also include year-to-date performance against plan for each of your budget categories . <p> The completed report should be signed by the treasurer , presented at your regular meeting , and filed for future reference . If you keep your financial records in a computer-based system , you may be able to generate the report automatically from the system . Check your user manual or online help for advice . <h> 4 . Reconcile Monthly <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTOs do , you should reconcile that account every month . <p> Occasionally , you may make a mistake when you record information in the checkbook . Banks also sometimes make mistakes . If you do not reconcile your checking account , you must rely solely on what the bank reports as your balance , even if that amount differs widely from what you think it should be . The longer an account goes unreconciled , the bigger the potential mess and the larger the risk to the PTO . <p> Reconciling is the mathematical process of verifying the balance in your account , based on the transactions posted against your account at the bank . <p> Reconciling by hand can take a little time and concentration , but it 's not an overwhelming task if it 's done promptly each month . Chances are , there 's a worksheet for account reconciliation printed on the back of your monthly statement . Detailed instructions likely are included there , too . If you consistently use a computer-based system , monthly reconciliation can be reduced to just a couple of minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What if your checking account has n't been reconciled for months ? You have two choices . You can find all the back statements and reconcile them month by month against the checkbook . Or if that is simply an impossible task , adjust the checkbook balance to match what the bank reports as of your last statement date . Be careful , though ; you will need to re-record any transactions that you posted to your check register after that date , because those will not be reflected on the bank statement . From that point on , do the right thing and reconcile each month . <p> If you are really stuck , check with your bank . They may be willing to spend some time with you getting your checkbook to match their balance . You may also be able to recruit a volunteer with a head for numbers from your members . It is far better to ask for help and get the matter under control than to allow a financial mess to fester. <h> 5 . Conduct an Annual Audit <p> The annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices . An audit can also highlight ideas for improvements in financial control and reporting . In the PTO world , an audit is a financial review , but the word does not refer to the legal opinion of a professional accounting firm , as is the case in the business world . PTO members , parent volunteers , or a paid professional can complete the PTO 's audit . <p> Some PTOs define the make-up of their audit committee in their bylaws . Other groups recruit one parent volunteer . In any case , if you have consistently applied good financial controls , your audit should run smoothly and be completed quickly . Your auditors will appreciate organized files , balanced records , and complete data . <p> Our charter school created a PTSO last year ( first year ) and the directors are requiring complete control of the bank accounts and decision making . They are the signers on the PTSO accounts and require all spending to go through them . We operate under the school 's tax ID# but PTSO members continue to say this complete control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PTSO President , try to exhibit some level of assertiveness on behalf of our group , I am shut down . These directors also want to attend our meetings ( by phone or in person ) , told us not to discuss budgets or spending with members and are not open to the idea of members voting on spending . We are going to hold a meeting with them next month at which time we will propose the firm structure of our PTSO , excluding their control , or the current officers are stepping down . Any **26;316;TOOLONG for us ? Thank you in advance ! <p> We are a PTO , I am currently looking up our current bylaws to find answers to some nagging questions . I have read the bylaws on this site and know that we have changed some bylaws to better fit us . My question is ... Are we not supposed to have members ( not just officers ) vote on where large amounts of monies are to be spent ? There are only 4 officers at this time and just recently 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a project that the Principal asked them to support . The 2 of us had no clue what the project was until the money was promised and we were informed much later , I 'm assuming this is inappropriate and would like some guidance on how to approach this situation . <p> Our PTA has just switched over to a PTO . I am the treasurer and we are in the middle of a school fundrasier that normally brings in at least $16,000 . I have been writing receipts to the children as the money come in . However , I have been told several times by a few committee members that there is no need to write receipts and that I am wasting my time . Although , I am volunteering for this position I do take it seriously and realize that I am the one ultimately responsible . It would be good to hear what some of you think . <p> Regarding whether teachers/administrators should have a vote on the PTO budget , I would ask you is your group a Parent Group or a Parent-Teacher Organization ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; admin are not members , then they should not have a say . If , however , it 's a Parent-Teacher group , they should . Our PTO bylaws state that every parent and staff member of our school is an automatic member , and dues are optional . To deal with any imbalance of parents vs. teachers , we have a few teacher reps , exec officers and committee chairs who make up our PTO Board and handle the majority of the decision making , like setting the budget . Then whoever attends the general meetings vote to approve or disapprove . If you do n't consult with staff , it 's really impossible to know all the needs of the school and the important ways the PTO can make a difference for the kids . <p> Our PTO allocates $100.00 to every teacher who submits receipts to our board regarding expenses they make that benefit our children . We budget approximately $3500.00 yearly for this . Is this ok to do ? Do we have to file any tax forms at a PTO to do this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the classrooms that benefit our children - but I 'm concerned about 990 tax forms we may have to complete . <p> You 're certainly doing the right thing by insisting on receipts . You work too hard at fundraising to be so casual with how the money is spent . On top of that , how would parents who contribute feel if they knew that the money was being used without a real system in place to keep track of it ? Because PTOs are all independent , there are no national guidelines . But there 's no doubt that turning in receipts is a best practice . The real risk is that money can easily be misspent , even for personal use , because you do n't have simple checks and balances in place . <p> I just took over as treasurer for our pto . I am frustrated because they are telling me that there are no receipts available for years past and for the current fiscal year I have not received all of the receipts . I am constantly being told to stop " stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back group " . I am also told that they are not filing IRS returns so they are not subject to the same rules as other organizations and non-profits . I used to run a 501(c)3 non-profit and I realize that the scale for a PTO is very different but I believe that the same best practices should apply . Could you point me to some legal or pto nationwide best practices documentation which shows that you must keep receipts for items purchased and for all cash receipts . <p> Regarding Michelle 's post ... Our teachers and administrators do NOT have a vote regarding how the money is spent . The funds belong to the PTO and we strongly feel that they can not tell us how to spend our money . We consider and discuss their requests/suggestions at exec. board meetings however , they do have a vote . The PTO is operated by parent volunteers and funded by parents dues/fundraiser support . Therefore , the parents should decide how to allocate the funds to benefit their children and the school . Welcome feedback and suggestions but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treas -- Legally they have no " right " to audit your group . You are an independent organization separate from the school . However , the district does have the power to make life very difficult for you -- for instance , preventing you from sending information home through the classrooms/students . The question you must weigh is how important it is to take a stand on this issue and what the consequences are likely to be . Good luck ! -- Craig <p> I have just gotten word that our School District plans on auditing our parent association . Can they do this ? Do they have any right to examine our books . We have set up our own audit committee to review the books . We are a 501 3c non-profit .

Generations of parent groups have fit this time-honored tradition into their fundraising calendars . <p> A bake sale can be as simple as a few plates of cookies and a cash box or as elaborate as an auction featuring celebrity bakers . However you choose to conduct your bake sale , this guide will give you step-by-step instructions , checklists , and creative ideas to make it your most successful one yet . <h> Why Have a Bake Sale ? <p> A bake sale is a relatively low-cost way to bring in money .

A bake sale fundraiser also allows many people to contribute . <p> A successful sale requires an organizer , bakers , workers , and , of course , customers . Time-strapped parents who are too busy to volunteer for school activities are often able to bake a batch of cookies or donate store-bought goods . Those with more availability can get involved organizing and staffing the sale . Volunteering on a low level reinforces the ties among families and the parent group , making your group " and your kids ' school " that much stronger . <h> Step 1 : Pre-Event Planning <p> First , appoint a chairperson .

Be sure to get permission from your town or city clerk to hold your bake sale at the polling place . <p> Community events : A community festival , arts fair , parade , or similar event will give you exposure to customers of all ages .

@@35479014 @4479014/ <h> Is Your School Parent-Friendly ? <p> From the staff to the building to the materials sent home , there are steps PTO leaders can take to help make their school a place where parents feel comfortable . <p> by Joy Underhill <p> 01/22/2014 <p> Picture walking into a new school for the first time . You do n't know your way around . You are n't sure of the sign-in procedures or even where to get information . You need a friendly face to help you out . <p> But will you find one ? <p> The first few minutes in a school give you important clues about its atmosphere . Is it a place that welcomes visitors and guests ? Or is everyone too preoccupied to lend a hand ? If your school is lacking in the social graces , maybe all it needs is a little attention to the details that separate a welcoming school from an intimidating one . <h> Why a Welcoming Atmosphere Matters <p> " The biggest payoff for a welcoming school is the win-win partnerships that result , " states Karen Willoughby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Early Childhood and Family Services in Virginia 's Fairfax County Public Schools . " It 's been shown time and time again that with today 's tough educational challenges , we need to develop parent-school relationships at the start of the school year . Creating a welcoming environment is one way to do that . " <p> Willoughby and her team have created a process to examine how welcoming a school is and to help develop an assessment team of school personnel and parents . " If we can create a comfortable bond with parents from day one , it makes it much easier to handle problems that come up later in the year , " she says . " If parents do n't feel that the school is approachable , it just makes communication issues worse . " <p> The need for openness is even more critical in schools with diverse cultures . " Imagine walking into a school where the signs are unfamiliar to you and no one offers to show you around , " notes Robin Hamby , a family services specialist at Fairfax County schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or come from a country where school participation is discouraged . Parents bring with them all sorts of baggage that can hinder the process of creating a strong bond with the school . " <h> Is Your School Welcoming ? <p> Fairfax County 's Welcoming Schools process uses four small teams to assess the overall atmosphere of the school . The teams " typically four or five people each " first meet to determine what they will examine , then do a walk-through of the school , with teams assigned to one of the four areas : school staff , physical environment , written materials , and practices and policies . ( See How To Evaluate Your School at the bottom of the page for a detailed checklist . ) <p> While the program is aimed at administration , PTOs are in a unique and powerful position for promoting a welcoming atmosphere at school . As a PTO leader , you approached the school first as a parent , but now you understand how vital parent involvement is to the overall health of a school and are willing to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression a visitor has of a school 's atmosphere is how she is greeted . ( If visitors are n't welcomed at all , that 's a clear indication of how the school views such " intruders . " ) Warm , friendly support staff who smile as they talk to you , ask whether you need help , and address concerns quickly and without a dismissive air are all signs of a welcoming school . <p> Physical Environment : It 's hard to feel welcome when you do n't know where you are or how to find out . Clearly marked entrances and exits , as well as signs translated into other languages spoken by students and parents , are essential . The tone used on signs also plays a part ; " please use another door " will get a more positive reaction than " no admittance . " Providing maps or guides to help visitors will always be well-received . <p> Written Materials : Even when they 're away from the physical building , parents can get a sense of whether the school welcomes their involvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to do that " especially if , as with signs at the school , they 're provided in multiple languages for those families who do n't speak English . <p> Practices and Policies : Well-trained staff , pretty school hallways , and plentiful written communication with families are practically useless without operational policies that allow parents to feel included . The most welcoming schools encourage frequent participation by parents and make it easy for them to do so . Establishing easy sign-in procedures at the school , for example , or returning phone and email messages promptly let 's parents know that administrators and staff members care . <p> " It 's best to create a diverse team so that the perspective will be more complete and fresh , " Hamby notes . " Invite someone who does n't visit the school often , such as a senior citizen or community leader . Make sure that if your student body is culturally diverse , your teams are too . And do n't overlook the value of inviting someone new to the school to serve on a team . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' minds open to what they 're seeing . One person could be asked to view the school through the eyes of a special needs child , another as a parent new to the school , and a third as a parent new to the country , for example . <p> As a final step , the teams share what they 've learned and offer suggestions for how the school environment could be improved . " It 's important to remain nonjudgmental , " Willoughby says . " No one likes to be criticized . The goal is to construct a more welcoming school , not attack the school for its shortcomings . " <p> Linda Peterson , director of the Parent Leadership Exchange , a Boston-based development program for parent leaders , runs a similar workshop . " Before you begin an assessment , you must define what parent involvement looks like for your school , " she says . " We talk to administrators , teachers , and parents to determine where the school stands today and to develop a plan . It may take a year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ideas . " <p> Peterson emphasizes the importance of evaluating as you go . " We are always asking , How does this connect back to student learning ? ' If school personnel ca n't answer that question , an idea might be jettisoned . Parent-teacher activities that are designed for socialization or fundraising are important for building relationships , but the most effective programs have a clear link to academic improvement . The Welcoming Schools program is an effective first step in opening schools doors and developing partnerships . " <h> How Parent Groups Can Help <p> The Welcoming Schools assessment can be initiated by parent groups with buy-in from school administrators . " You ca n't go barging in expecting schools to make changes , " Hamby notes , " unless you 've first prepared the way by developing a positive PTO-administrator link . " <p> Some steps your parent group can take to partner with the school in making it more welcoming : <p> Remember to get the blessing of the principal first " then present your ideas and offer help . <p> Ask administrators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with the school to address them . <p> Always begin with the positive when making suggestions . <p> Use words that do n't offend . Rather than saying " Clean the halls better , " phrase it as " Consider assigning a student monitor for litter pickup . " <p> Send a survey to ask parents whether they feel welcome at school and to solicit suggestions . <p> Avoid finger-pointing and emphasize the importance of teamwork . <p> Make sure your parent group is welcoming to new members ! <p> One of the challenges of creating a strong bond with schools is broadening how schools perceive their role . " Many schools see themselves as administrators of education , " Willoughby says . " We 'd like them to view themselves as service providers . In doing so , the opportunity for parent-school collaborations becomes that much easier . " <h> Ideas for Creating a Welcoming School <p> Include student artwork or poetry in materials that go home , such as newsletters and classroom flyers . <p> Have a sign-in and badge pick-up area at the entrance to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send duplicate school materials to parents who live in separate households . <p> Ask how students ' names are pronounced and use nicknames if they are preferred . <p> Color-code materials that are sent home for quick recognition . For example , always use yellow paper for forms that need to be returned to school . <p> Provide a drop box on the office counter for parent comments . <p> Create a bulletin board with photos of people in the school community . <p> Make sure that postings on bulletin boards represent the diversity of the school 's student and staff populations . <p> Provide translations of the school handbook if necessary . <p> If a school expansion is planned , have a PTO team work with the architects to ensure that permanent signage , lighting , windows , and hallway design are conducive to an open atmosphere . <p> Verify that the needs of special education students are met . <h> How To Evaluate Your School <p> The Welcoming Schools process created by staff at Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia looks at four areas in depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each area ; after making their assessments , they share results and develop an action plan to address any weak spots . <p> School Staff How are you treated when you enter the office ?

@@35479015 @4479015/ <h> Three Decisionmaking Methods <p> These processes for reaching a decision can help parent group leaders get past ( or avoid ) a stalemate . <p> by Rita Milios <p> 11/24/2014 <p> When there 's a difference of opinion in a parent group , even making a simple decision can become complicated . Everyone wants her voice to be heard , but not all decisions can be reached that way . As a leader , it 's important to have a clear idea of how decisions are made within your PTO in various situations . By guiding that process , you can ensure that decisions take place in the most effective way . <p> Most common issues , such as the choice of a yearly fundraiser , the ways a PTO can best support its school community , or the responsibilities of committees , can be resolved using one of three basic decisionmaking methods . These methods " consensus , accommodation , and de facto " each have advantages and disadvantages , so the first step is deciding which process best suits the situation at hand . <h> Consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision , use a consensus decisionmaking process . In selecting a major fundraiser , for example , reaching consensus will result in a greater commitment from all members to support the effort . <p> To gain consensus , or overall agreement , you should allow adequate time for discussion , questions , and possibly debate . Compromises will most likely need to be made , so this method requires a great deal of flexibility . However , each member has an equal opportunity to be heard and to contribute to the outcome . Consensus is reached when all agree that the final decision is one they can support . <h> Accommodation <p> When consensus can not be reached , a decision may instead need to be made through accommodation . For example , if only one committee member opposes an idea everyone else supports , she may be willing to accommodate the group to avoid a stalemate and to allow the committee to move on to other agenda items . <p> In this decisionmaking process , not everyone agrees with the outcome . Some group members may feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given in to keep the peace or to bring closure to an issue . <p> Accommodation , like consensus , may require a great deal of discussion before a decision is made . Quite often , issues are settled by calling for a vote . But in the end , it is usually the more powerful members or most convincing debaters whose ideas hold sway . <p> Accommodation is common when some PTO members are newer or less confident about their status within the group . One danger is that a dominant member or clique may wear down less powerful members to get their way , even if their ideas are not the most popular . Being aware of when accommodation is being used , and by whom , can help you identify other potential leaders and also become aware of emerging factions . If not addressed , such factions can undermine your group 's unity and even result in unnecessary power struggles . <h> De Facto <p> De facto decisions usually are made when consensus can not be reached or accommodation has failed . In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes on the responsibility of making the decision for the entire group . A PTO president may have the authority to make certain decisions without asking for the group 's input , such as when to call a meeting or create a new committee . <p> Committees often make de facto decisions for the larger PTO . For instance , a movie night committee may have the authority to make decisions about how to publicize the event . When a committee is chosen to take charge of a project , it is a good idea to establish up front which decisionmaking method will be used within the committee as well as between the committee and the PTO as a whole . Establishing set protocols will save time and trouble down the line . <p> A committee may essentially be given free rein over a project , with the PTO leadership giving sufficient authority to committee members so they can independently make most decisions about the project . Nonetheless , PTO leaders should be kept informed about the decisions being made . It 's best to have deadlines for reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for guidance or advise about potential problems ) , and agreement on the best method of communication . <p> Decisions within a committee can often be made by consensus . Because the number of decisionmakers is smaller and the group is unified by its overall committee responsibility ( to publicize a fundraiser , for example ) , gaining consensus within a committee is usually easier than gaining consensus within the entire PTO . <p> The committee chair should act as the team leader to set an agenda for the decisionmaking process , clarify the overall goal , define in general terms what an acceptable outcome includes , and keep discussion to an appropriate time frame . When an acceptable outcome is reached , the chair should briefly summarize the decision so that all members understand what it is . <p> But even within a committee , consensus is not always possible , and there are times when accommodation is necessary .

@@35479017 @4479017/ <h> Connect With Immigrant Parents <p> One group 's innovative event to help immigrant parents adapt to U.S. school culture provides lots of lessons for reaching out to families . <p> by Patty Catalano <p> 01/22/2014 <p> Imagine sitting at a table in a classroom with your child 's teacher . He 's talking to you while holding a report card and folder with your child 's name on it , but you do n't understand what he 's saying . You 're uncomfortable maintaining eye contact with him and want to say something , anything , but you do n't know what . So you 're silent and can only nod . About 15 minutes later , you walk away feeling confused and frustrated ; the teacher , likewise . <p> It may sound like a bad dream , but for some parents who are new to this country or who have limited English abilities , this is a common outcome of parent-teacher conferences . And for a while , it was the experience of many Chinese- , Korean- , and Spanish-speaking families who were uncomfortable participating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Md . The language barrier was compounded by cultural differences " the active student participation expected in U.S. schools may be viewed as disrespectful behavior elsewhere , and for many of these parents , involvement in their children 's education was unheard of unless there was a problem . <p> One parent group , Hollifield Station Elementary PTA , found an inspired way to bridge these gaps . The group , with the help of district coordinators , organized an event called American Culture Night . It was so successful that immigrant families are connecting with the school " and getting involved in the PTA . <h> Lost in Translation <p> Late into her first year as president of Hollifield Station Elementary School PTA , Linda Dombrowski was concerned . It seemed to her that Hollifield , home to some 100 immigrant families " the county 's largest school population of nonnative English speakers " was experiencing a culture clash . Reports from teachers about parents feeling lost at school and a general lack of success with their parent-teacher conferences were echoing in the school 's hallways . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and when they had conferences , English was a barrier . " <p> Hoping to chip away at these barriers , Dombrowski surveyed teachers about how to make immigrant families feel more at home at Hollifield . The top recommendations were to improve the parent-teacher conference process and give parents with limited English a better understanding of their children 's curriculum , performance measurement criteria , classroom activities , and customs in general . Dombrowski added another item : Make immigrant parents feel comfortable enough to share their talents and time with the school . <h> Reaching Out for Help <p> Reaching out to international families at Hollifield meant that Dombrowski would have to cross some language borders . She teamed up with Kimberly Kim , distric ESOL liaison , and Young-chan Han , family outreach specialist . The three worked during the early summer weeks and sketched out plans for American Culture Night , to be held in October . <p> By July , they had crafted a night of activities and presentations covering topics as varied as school policy , curriculum , holiday celebrations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bus procedures . Specifically , Dombrowski says , " The goal of the evening was to help parents feel connected , comfortable , and confident with the education their children were receiving . " <h> Getting the Word Out , and Families In <p> Han and Dombrowski knew , though , that no matter how well-planned the event , getting immigrant parents to attend American Culture Night would depend on how welcoming and clear the invitation was . Han says the list of invited families was generated from a survey , sent earlier in the year , that asked whether they needed translation or interpretation services . The district ESOL office 's staff of certified interpreters and translators began publicizing the event in July by mailing flyers translated into Chinese , Japanese , Korean , Spanish , and Urdu . <p> Interpreters also followed up with personal phone calls . According to Han , an invitation of this sort was foreign to many parents , and several of them initially thought the request to come to school meant that their children were in trouble . " Lots of parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " she says . In the weeks before the event , Han had her staff of interpreters make a second call to families to encourage their participation . They also urged attendees to share a dish and offered on-site baby-sitting services , provided by Hollifield 's art teacher . <h> Inside the American Classroom <p> Some 50 parents came to the first American Culture Night , which began with a brief presentation about holidays and themes tied into the school 's curriculum with in-school celebrations . While about 30 kids hung out and drew with Travers , the parents rotated , interpreters on hand , through mini-presentations on four topics : school policies , classroom culture , athletics and competition , and parent-teacher conferences . <p> For the last , certified interpreters who had received specialized training led families through a mock parent-teacher conference to explain teacher expectations and effective communication techniques . The enactment was so realistic , Dombrowski says , that one of the parents in attendance shouted , " That happened to me ! " <p> The station on classroom culture gave parents a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for students to maintain eye contact with teachers and to participate frequently in classroom discussions . In other cultures , and particularly in Korea , Han says , students are told to look down and away from elders and teachers and not to question authority , unlike in the United States . In addition , parents are discouraged from getting involved with their children 's homework , and meetings of parent groups are unheard of . " PTA is so foreign , and their role is so foreign , " Han says . " Parents involved in education is foreign . " <p> That began changing for the families at American Culture Night as they sat at their children 's desks and took in the classroom experience . " Parents felt so comfortable in school asking questions and walking around classrooms , " Han says . For Dombrowski , one of the highlights was being able to tell parents who had little to no understanding of the PTA 's role , " This is what we do.We do this for our kids . " <h> A Multinational Sensation <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On an evaluation form sent immediately following the event , families rated the parent-teacher conference and classroom culture sessions as the most informative and indicated that the rest of the presentations were extremely worthwhile . Many parents also took the first step toward greater involvement : They provided suggestions . Topic recommendations for future events included raising children to be independent , leadership in American society , and dealing with misbehavior driven by cultural differences . Leaders already at work on next year 's American Culture Night plan to incorporate these suggestions . <p> Dombrowski and Han also spun the momentum into another event for the international community . In May , to celebrate Older Americans Month and Asian Heritage Month , the Hollifield PTA and Han 's ESOL office teamed with Howard County 's Office on Aging , the state attorney 's office , and the Korean-American Senior Association . The result was an intergenerational dance , with line-dancing lessons , light aerobics , and Caribbean steel-drum music . <p> For the Hollifield PTA , the ocean that used to separate international families and the school seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more colorful , and a whole lot clearer for immigrant families . Because of American Culture Night , parents are aware of the school 's desire for them to be partners . <p> " If all goes well , we are turning over a number of our teacher events , like conference dinners and appreciation , to our Korean parents to run , " she says . " You ca n't have expectations without communication . " <h> Tips for Parent Group Leaders <p> Although your school system may not have ESOL services as comprehensive as Howard County ( Md . ) Public Schools ' Family &amp; Community Outreach Office , there are still opportunities for parent groups to help immigrant families assimilate at school . <p> Here are some of Young-chan Han 's tips for effectively reaching out to the families in your community . <p> Use your school newsletter ( and volunteer surveys ) to recruit bilingual parent volunteers . They can help with simple phone calls and other contacts with parents who speak little or no English . <p> In reaching out to Asian families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian families can read simple notes . Han says to avoid cursive writing , as it 's not always taught in other countries . <p> For Hispanic parents , phone calls are generally more effective than printed material . Have a Spanish-speaking staff member , parent volunteer , or bilingual liaison make the contact . <p> Avoid using educational jargon in your outgoing messages . Spell out proper names ( avoid acronyms ) , including those for state aptitude tests and even your parent group 's name . <p> Contact ethnic organizations such as Korean churches , Muslim community organizations , and Hispanic organizations to recruit bilingual volunteers to help communicate with families learning English . Sometimes you can find help at ethnic businesses , too , such as Chinese restaurants . <p> Create a bilingual welcoming committee at school made up of parents , staff , and community members . This is a great way to support parents who are new to the country . <p> She notes that parents with foreign last names are not automatically limited English speakers ; parent groups need to be sensitive to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers and rely heavily on the school 's website . But , she says , keep in mind that many families new to this country , especially low income families , do not own computers . At one meeting she attended with seven Hispanic parents of middle school students , none of the families owned a computer . <p> Han 's final advice for parent groups reaching out to international families : " It may take a long time for parents to feel comfortable . Be patient with the outcome . Do n't think they 're unreachable .

Experienced readers know the best way to do this is to create a book club . <p> Book clubs are generally a more social , less academic way to explore comprehension and meaning while learning from the insights of others . As a 1st grade teacher , I wondered how to create a book club experience that would be fun and challenging for all my students , addressing the capabilities of my below-grade-level , on-level , and above-grade-level readers alike . <p> With a demanding academic curriculum for the 2008-09 school year , how could I possibly add a book club to our already jam-packed school day ? Would a book club be too much for a 6-year-old ? Most important , how could I accommodate the diversity of reading levels within the class ? In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club . <p> The purpose of the book club would be to help my 1st grade students at Myron J. Francis Elementary in Rumford , R.I. , become better readers . I wanted them to reach a deeper level of comprehension in their reading while exploring different genres , such as fiction , nonfiction , mystery , and biography . <h> Getting Started <p> I quickly realized that parent involvement was the key . Obviously , a parent or guardian would have to read with the child , make the time commitment , transport the child , and participate in the meeting . <p> I decided to start with a trial book club night in November 2008 . But when would be a good time ? If the book club took place in the early evening , after supper but before bedtime , most parents would be available . I decided that 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. would be best . Since our school building would be closed , we would have to find a convenient location for our meeting . I contacted the children 's librarian at our town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to let us use a private room at the library on the designated night . She also ordered additional copies of the selected book so parents could participate without the expense of having to buy the book . <p> Announcements went home to the parents of students in my class , explaining the parent-child book club concept . The flyer listed the location of the library , the time , and the book that we would be discussing and noted the availability of extra copies at the library . It also solved the issue of differing reading levels by giving parents the option of listening to their child read the book or reading the book to their child . Attendance at the book club was voluntary . There were three weeks between the distribution of the flyer and the first book club meeting . <p> On the bottom of the flyer was a return slip to be filled out by the parent and sent back to class within the week . This allowed me to gauge the level of interest and get an accurate count of parents and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) signed up for our initial meeting . That meant at least 24 people would be coming . <p> Selecting a book that would be fun and interesting and that would engage my beginning readers was crucial to the success of our meeting . I selected the fiction book Dinosaurs Before Dark , from the Magic Tree House series by Mary Pope Osborne , to be the first book for discussion because of my students ' high interest in the series . <p> I wrote a set of 20 questions as a reading group guide to lead the discussion . The questions started out simple : What were the names of the brother and sister in the story ? Then they became more complex : What would you have done if you were Annie ? <p> I decided to include a hands-on activity , such as a drawing of a favorite part of the book , to keep the children actively engaged during the meeting . And a little refreshment , juice and cookies for the children , would be an added benefit . <h> Our First Meeting <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parents and students arrived with their books , grabbed a carpet square , sat on the floor , and got ready for the discussion . Our first parent-child book club had begun . After a few minutes of lively discussion , I realized it was going great . The children were enthusiastic and came up with some of their own questions to supplement mine . They were surprisingly respectful of differing opinions expressed by others . <p> The hour was over before we knew it , and the parents were amazed to see how animated , engaged , and insightful their children were . <p> By the end of the school year , we had had six lively , diverse , and fun book club meetings . We explored fiction , nonfiction , mystery , fantasy , and biography . Parents loved watching their children actively learn . As word got out , our attendance steadily increased . An unexpected bonus was that parents learned how to ask the deeper questions necessary for good reading comprehension . In addition , it was obvious that both children and parents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more successful than I ever imagined . My greatest joy as a 1st grade teacher is to nurture a love of reading . A parent-child book club is a wonderful way to share that joy . <h> Tips To Start Your Own Book Club <p> Start small . Get three or four interested parents and children in the same grade from your neighborhood or PTO . <p> Ask your child 's teacher for a starter list of appropriate grade-level books . These should be good for discussion and be taken from diverse genres . <p> Determine a convenient location and time for parents to meet . <p> Emphasize that this night is a special time for a parent and child ; no siblings , please ! <p> Have a volunteer parent lead the discussion . The discussion leader provides questions and some small refreshments . Rotate leaders for each meeting . <p> At the end of a meeting , determine which book will be read next and who will be leading the discussion .

We 'll walk you through the process , from getting a domain name to promoting and maintaining the site . <p> by Sharron Kahn Luttrell <p> 01/04/2016 <p> Page 1 of 2 <p> If communication is the key to parent involvement , then consider a website to be a virtual door that opens onto your PTO . Even if your group publishes a monthly newsletter , sends home notices , and submits items to the local newspaper , there 's still room in your media mix for a website . <p> An online presence will not get misplaced , nor will it end up crumpled in a ball at the bottom of a child 's backpack . What it will do is give parents instant access to the information they need , when they need it . <h> Getting Started <p> Put someone in charge . Behind every good website is a webmaster . Appoint a volunteer to take charge of your website . The person in this role will provide content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; maintain the site regularly ( you should update it at least once a month " more is better ) ; and train a successor . <p> The main requirement for a webmaster is enthusiasm . Experience and technical know-how certainly help but are n't strictly necessary . Carmon Brooks of Brownsville , Ky. , thought an online presence was so important for the Kyrock Elementary PTO that she volunteered to create and maintain a site even though she had never done one before . She learned the basics from the school 's technology resource teacher . Then , using a free website creation and hosting service , she put together a site . <p> Secure a domain name and a host . If you do n't already have a domain name and a server to host your site , then talk with your school technology coordinator about the best option for your PTO . These may include a fee-based web hosting service ; your school district 's own server ; a community organization that 's willing to give you space on its server ; or a free service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling on a host , decide as a group what you want your site to achieve . If your intent is to post basic information , such as events and a meeting schedule , and you have little desire to get fancy with your site , consider a free service or your school server . If you 'd like to get more out of your site , then a web hosting company is probably a good investment . <p> A web hosting service will give you the most flexibility , and you 'll have a better shot at securing a domain name that 's easy to remember and reflects the name of your parent group ( such as www.cloughpto.org for the Henry P. Clough School PTO , in Mendon , Mass . ) . But as long as you have a link somewhere to your school 's website , users will be able to find you online , no matter how indecipherable your web address . <p> The Jamie McGee Elementary PTO in Bolingbrook , Ill. , turned its site into a dynamic , interactive communication tool by moving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site features a bulletin board , which allows parents and board members to leave messages for one another online . It also has the capability to accept online registrations for PTO events and allows users to order school supplies and spiritwear online . McGee PTO President Michael Bielski , who designs websites through his firm TheBielskiBunch.com , has another compelling reason to take the PTO site off the school 's server . After agreeing to host the parent group 's site , the school administration had second thoughts when it realized the group needed access to the district 's server . By then , the PTO site was live , but the group was unable to update it . The information quickly grew stale . " They never really envisioned us putting a site up there that we 'd want to keep working with . They thought it would just be a page , " Bielski says . <p> Before accepting space on a school or community server , find out about restrictions . And keep in mind that if their server goes down , you 're out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free web hosting service , make sure your school server will link to it . Brooks was surprised when , after she labored to create the Kyrock Elementary PTO site on Yahoo 's GeoCities service , she learned that nobody could access it because her district 's server had blocked the server that hosted the site . <h> Creating the Site and Adding Content <p> As a parent group with a lot of information to share , you 'll have no difficulty filling your website . The trick is to keep the content meaningful , useful , and fun while presenting it in a way that is easy to read and navigate . <p> I created our website using my-pto.org . They are awesome - free service for the core ( which provides more than enough capability for most PTOs imho ) , much more customization available than with the " template " sites but still starts you off with a core site that you can have up in hours just by updating the " template " content . They also have a bunch of fee based higher level services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super helpful support . You can tell I 'm a big fan ! I piloted a couple of other options , and quickly killed them once I got this site up . The out of the box templates are n't quite as smooth as some other options available , but with the customization options you can make the site be pretty much anything you want . <p> We are in the process of setting up a PTO website and the one BIG concern is how to have the link with the PTO Directory ( with parents addresses and emails ) confidential . We are going paperless and having the directory secure is a big deal . How would you suggest we do this ? How can we ensure the parents it 's confidential ? <p> Hi Debbie -- Sorry , that 's not a service we 're equipped to offer . However , there are lots of inexpensive web hosting companies out there .

In the end , you 'll still be making a difference for your school and the students . 168491 @qwx368491 <p> mmcaldwell writes:This will be my second year as PTO President and I have a full-time job as well .

@@35479051 @4479051/ <h> Partnership Model Builds Involvement <p> The National Network of Partnership Schools focuses on helping schools build broad-based parent involvement using a team model . <p> by Michelle Bates Deakin <p> Four years ago , PTA President Jeff Falk was searching for a way to get more parents involved in Park Avenue Elementary School " a tall order for the Danbury , Conn. , school , which historically has had a very involved parent community . <p> But Falk wanted to reach out beyond the ring of usual suspects : upper-income parents with high-achieving kids . And he was n't just looking for involvement in the PTA . The former research chemist turned stay-at-home dad was hoping to get parents intimately involved in the schools curriculum with an eye toward improving the performance of all the students , whether they spoke English or one of the school 's nine other languages : Bulgarian , Cambodian , Chinese , French , Khmer , Pakistani , Portuguese , Spanish , and Russian . <p> For a model of how to involve parents in improving schools , Falk and the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools at Johns Hopkins University . The group provided a road map for Park Avenue to follow . <p> The plan showed the school how to create five action teams for reading , writing , math , behavior , and partnerships . And in just four years , the results of those teams have been dramatic . Standardized test scores have risen , and behavior problems with children have dwindled , with suspensions all but disappearing . Communication between parents and teachers has flourished , with multilingual volunteers sending newsletters and making phone calls to parents each month . <p> " The Network pointed the way for us , " says Falk . " It allowed us to go menu shopping and look at what other schools have done and what 's worked . " <p> The Network , as it is known , may be anchored in the research laboratories of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , but in its seven years , it has grown far beyond academic studies and papers . Today , it links more than 170 schools , 160 school districts , and 20 state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for connecting the three most important components of a child 's education : school , family , and community . <p> " We 're focused on student success , " says Joyce Epstein , a sociologist and director of the Network . " We 're trying to help school and district leaders create organized programs for school-family-community partnerships that will focus activities on helping students succeed in school at higher levels . " <p> Central to the Network 's mission is involving all families " particularly those that would n't typically join a group like the PTO because of language barriers , transportation difficulties , or scheduling conflicts for working parents . <p> When Epstein started her research at Johns Hopkins , she recalls , people were asking , " Which is more important in educating kids : school or family ? " " But we realized that was n't the right question to ask . The focus instead has shifted to how to combine school and family , along with community , to help children learn best . " <p> The formal Network started in the 1996-97 school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying school and family involvement in the elementary grades , gradually moving on to examine the impact on middle schools and then high schools . Finally , Epstein extended the studies to district and state leadership to see what kinds of programs at those levels could support family and community involvement . " We decided that we had so much information that we wanted to find a way to make it available for schools to use , " she says . <p> At the same time , schools and school districts were searching for models of how to improve family and community partnerships , and the Network was born . It allows schools to put research topics into practice , and it let 's researchers see their theories come alive . And the Network let 's schools swap ideas about what works with one another . <h> The PTO 's Role <p> Epstein emphasizes that PTOs and the Network complement one another . " The Network expands the typical program of a PTA or PTO to include links to what teachers do , parent-teacher conferences , homework , and course choices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PTO . " <p> In fact , parent-teacher groups can be an effective part of a schools plan to communicate with parents and drum up volunteers . " We 're partners with the PTA , " says Gloria G. Cicero , principal of the Clover Street School in Windsor , Conn. , which has been part of the Network for seven years . " We 're all a part of the community of learners . " <p> In Naperville , Ill. , the Highlands Elementary School has two parent groups . Home and School is the traditional parent fundraising group , and School Family Community Partnership ( SFCP ) focuses on extracurricular academic programs . " The two groups are complementary , " says Lisa Trychta , co-chair of the SFCP . " We do services , workshops , and programs with families , and Home and School funds our budget . " <p> Network programs , such as Highlands SFCP , go where PTOs often ca n't " directly into a school 's curriculum . Network action teams , like those at Park Avenue Elementary , include parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how to inform parents about what children are learning and how parents can participate in that process . <h> Linking Parents and Teachers <p> The Network helps schools develop TIPS programs that are specifically aimed at involving parents with each students studies . TIPS stands for Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork . Research clearly demonstrates that parent involvement in homework helps children perform better , get higher grades , and have better attitudes and higher aspirations . But many parents do n't know where to begin to help children with homework , and many teachers need assistance in developing homework that creates a role for parents . The TIPS program helps with both sides of the homework puzzle . <p> " TIPS helps teachers design homework that requires youngsters to share what they 're learning in school so their parents can give encouragement and celebrate successes and let the youngsters know that what they 're doing is of interest , " says Epstein . <p> At Park Avenue , even kindergartners have TIPS-style homework . When the 5-year-olds study patterns and shapes , for example , students must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their house that are round . Parents help students glue the objects onto paper and bring them back to school . <p> The homework is accompanied by a parent sheet " written in English , Spanish , and Portuguese " that parents sign and send back . There 's also room on the sheet for parents to indicate whether their child understood the assignment or had difficulty and whether the parent needs to discuss any difficulties with the teacher . <p> " The TIPS program reinforces what the children are learning in school , and it shows parents what skills their children are mastering , " says Falk . In addition to being parent group president for four years , Falk also sits on the school 's Math Action Team , which puts on family math nights at the school and plans TIPS activities . <p> Since Park Avenue joined the Network , its students ' scores on Connecticut standardized tests have shown marked improvement . From 1999 to 2001 , the school increased the number of students meeting the state goal from 54 percent to 66 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the same period , the percentage of students meeting the reading goal rose from 38 percent to 45 percent , and the percentage of students meeting the writing goal more than doubled , rising from 21 percent to 43 percent . <p> But the results have n't been just academic . Park Avenue 's Right Stuff Action Team focused on developing positive character traits . Its success is measured by a startling drop in school suspensions . The year before Network programs started at the school , 20 children received suspensions in one school year . Over the past three years , only one or two children have been suspended during each school year . The action team has helped children focus on topics such as respect , friendship , and honesty . Children write paragraphs on the traits and older children are selected to read them to the school . Teachers nominate Right Stuff Kids who exemplify the traits , and those children are rewarded with buttons or ice cream in schoolwide family meetings . <p> Falk volunteers as a cafeteria monitor and has seen dramatic results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout in my booming voice to quiet the room , " says Falk . " Now I can just flick the lights and raise my hand , and the room goes quiet . We do n't have to act like drill sergeants anymore , and we can see children treating each other with more respect . It 's been a wonderful thing to watch . " <h> A Six-Sided Approach to Involvement <p> Schools perform best when students are surrounded by six types of involvement , building a hexagon of virtues around the children . Joyce Epstein , director of the National Network of Partnership Schools at Johns Hopkins University , describes the most important kinds of involvement as parenting , communicating , volunteering , learning at home , decision-making , and collaborating with the community . Below is a description of each type of involvement and an example of a program created by a Network school to foster it . <p> Type 1 , Parenting : Schools and communities should assist families with parenting and child-rearing advice about elementary through high school children . Schools also can aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each age and grade level . In addition , school teachers and administrators need help understanding families . <p> The Parent Education Course at the Roscoe Elementary School in Sun Valley , Calif. , was a 12-week parent education course to improve communication between parents and students and to reduce disruptive behavior at school and at home . In addition , teachers received a two-day training program . In all , 135 parents completed the course , and 75 percent of them reported a change in parenting techniques and their children 's resulting behaviors . <p> Type 2 , Communicating : Schools should communicate with families about school programs and student progress and make sure that parents are able to respond easily to what they are hearing . <p> Coffees With the Principal at Naperville ( I 'll . ) North High School were social gatherings to help parents feel more comfortable after three principal and leadership changes in as many years . The team set up a series of informal meetings between parents and the principal at parents ' homes in each elementary school district . About 150 parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 7 to 8:30 p.m. ( some lasted as late as 9:30 ) . Each of the coffees helped set up a dialog between the principal and the parents . <p> Type 3 , Volunteering : Schools should improve the recruitment and training of parent volunteers , and they should work to have flexible scheduling to accommodate working parents . <p> Calling All Males at The Clover Street School in Windsor , Conn. , focused on drumming up volunteer fathers and male relatives . The elementary school sent out fliers announcing bimonthly meetings for men . The group spearheaded three activities : a Santa visit , a family skating party and fundraiser , and a family fun night , which attracted 150 people to play basketball and bowl on a Monday evening . <p> Type 4 , Learning at Home : Schools should encourage families to assist children with their home and curriculum-linked activities and decisions . <p> A Family Fun Math Night at Cottonwood Elementary School helped Cincinnati parents understand what children needed to learn to be proficient in math . <p> A team of parents and teachers created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth-grade math proficiency test . Students and parents competed together , and Professor Mathman " a parent decked out in a wig and full costume " was a lively master of ceremonies . The evening excited children about math , taught parents about what the kids were learning , and showed everyone that math can be fun . <p> Type 5 , Decisionmaking : Schools should include families in school decisions and governance through PTAs/PTOs and other parent organizations . <p> A Parent Council at the West Carrollton ( Ohio ) Early Childhood Center helps that school ensure that it 's tapping parents to their fullest potential . The school 's Family and Teachers for Children group is divided into five smaller councils that reflect five of Epstein 's principles : parenting , communication , volunteering , learning at home , and collaborating with the community . <p> Each of these councils meets monthly , as does an advisory council , which includes a representative from each group . The structure allows parents to choose their particular types of involvement according to their own strengths and interests . <p> Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and services for families and students with business and other groups to provide community services . <p> The Quilting Project at Galena ( Md . ) Middle School has brought together sixth-graders and families , community members , and teachers .

Good luck , and thanks for the great idea ! <h> Reply to Tara <p> Thanks for responding Tara--I also feel either one of those ideas is great so I 'll see what I can do with a little negotiation . <p> By the way , if you 're looking into a tool/building type night and you have a Home Depot in your area , I 've heard that they are a great source of info and some stores offer employees that will come to the school to be instructors for such an event . <p> hello .. i have some comments about both nights .. just playing devil 's advocate here ... <p> first , my husband has gone to a couple of girl scout dad/daughter dances .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand against the wall , feeling awkward chatting with people they hardly know ( we all know women bond better at these events ) and the girls ran around and did a lot of screaming to music that the dads hated . <p> secondly , .. in a public school , it 's tough to promote a mother/son , father/daughter as there are SO MANY different family situations .. kids live with just mom or just dad or aunts , uncles , grandparents , parents that may be gay or lesbian .. and so on .. <p> why not just have 2 different " family nights " have a dance , and then have maybe a sport or tool or arts n crafts thing .. and let the crowd decide which event is the most comfortable for them ? ? <p> I think Robin hit the nail on the head . Having gone to 2 Father/Daughter dances for Girl Scouts , I have to elaborate on what Robin said . <p> To really make it uncomfortable for the dads , have the dance be a 50 's dance .

I know the people who set it up had very good intentions and did a lot of planning . But seriously , Father/Daughter dances are pretty much like Robin said . The girls want to dance , but the dads do n't know the " Electric Glide " and so even those that are willing to try look and feel awkward . Maybe some dads could try a little harder , but it is similar to some moms being asked to play touch football with their sons . Some will give it a try , while others will flat out refuse . <p> A suggestion , for Mother/Son instead of board games how about BINGO . We had a BINGO night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gave back all of the money as prizes . ( Lots of $5 Dairy Queen certificates . ) All the kids sat and played with their parents , I did not see any kid running around like it usually happens . <p> And for Father/Daughter , how about a gym night . Even if you played floor hockey ( Haqndicap the dads somehow ) , or SPUD , or put out the tumbling mats , or even try double dutch jump roping . I would bet you would get more dads willing to try double dutch jump roping than dance to the YMCA song . <p> I realize you may have different issues at public schools than I am used to dealing with , but at our school Pre-K thru 8 , I have organized Father/Daughter and Mother/Son dances for the last 3 years . We have a great DJ which might be the difference from dads propping themselves against the walls and our dad 's who are doing the limbo , twisting and even trying the latest dance moves . We have been growin every year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 families at either event . We give $10 gift certificates to the winners of various dance contests . We provide refreshments only . The dances are from 6:30 - 9 as the little ones get tired early . There is a nominal fee , just enough to cover the DJ ( at a discount ) and the snacks . We also have a private photographer come in and take pictures for an additional fee . The photographer is totally on their own financially , we do n't pay her , and we do n't even guarantee a certain amount of business . Its on a Friday evening so that helps keep the cost of the DJ down . I think its worth trying at any school . For our children who do n't live with both parents , they have brought their parent anyway , or even grandparent , aunt or uncle in other cases . Good Luck with whatever avenue you plan to pursue .

So should both board and general meeting minutes and agendas , and your treasurer 's year-end financial reports and statements .

@@35479071 @4479071/ <h> Can a 501c3 give thank you gifts to school staff and/or parent volunteers ? <p> No one suggested the activity be hidden . All PTO expenses are categorized to fit within the different program areas . " Appreciation " activities ( either school or volunteer ) could justifiably fit under categories like " School Spirit " , " Teacher Appreciation " , " Community Building " . What type of appreciation gifts to give ( if any ) is absolutely a group 's policy decision . But the fact they can be given - subject to reasonable discretion - is not the issue . Aligning legitimate expenses with organizational program areas is simply accounting , not fraud . <p> Wow--Ciaara--tough love . Of course teachers follow their profession by choice , we all do .

@@35479076 @4479076/ <h> 10 Tips for Classroom Volunteers <p> A teacher and PTO leader offers tips on how class moms and dads can help " and have a more rewarding volunteer experience , too . <p> by Eileen Palma <p> 05/01/2015 <p> Are you a parent volunteer who is unhappy or bored with the way your volunteer experience is going ? If so , do n't get discouraged . You have the power to make your volunteer experience more valuable for your cooperating teacher , for yourself , and , most important , for the students . <p> A non-teacher would never guess the stress that teachers go through in preparing and organizing tasks for volunteers to complete . Today 's teachers are busy dealing with discipline issues , proficiency testing , constantly changing curriculums , and student safety . Many stay after school until well past dinner trying to stay on top of the game . A collective groan surges through the teachers lounge as we realize parent volunteers are coming and we still have n't found the time to organize tasks for them . <p> The stressors that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also the very same reasons we so desperately need assistance in our classrooms . We need volunteers now more than ever to help our students achieve the highest academic success and to help shape our children into individuals with strong spirits . <p> As a teacher , I strive to make the best use of volunteers by assigning them important and meaningful work . But it 's always a struggle to find the time to organize projects for my volunteer or even to explain how the classroom works . So over the years , I 've devised a system that sets up the volunteers for success throughout the year , no matter how busy I get . <h> 1 . First Meeting <p> Schedule a 20-minute conference with your cooperating teacher to cover your daily responsibilities , grading policies , the classroom behavior plan , special needs of individual students , and schoolwide safety procedures . Bring a list of specific questions and concerns to make the most of your scheduled time . Do n't forget to ask about procedures for fire drills , school lockdowns , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cooperating teacher to set aside a work area for you , such as a table or extra student desk . Assign a few students to label and decorate signs for your table and chair . This will remind students and a harried teacher not to use your work area as a miscellaneous storage space on days that you 're not volunteering . <p> Have the teacher set aside an extra stapler , pair of scissors , tape dispenser , roll of masking tape , glue bottle , pencils , Sharpie and project markers , different-colored pens , and stickers or stamps with a stamp pad . The extra time your teacher takes to assemble these materials will save you both time later when you 're in the middle of a lesson that requires any of these supplies . <p> Select another few students to label all of your supplies with masking tape and a marker . Assigning tasks to students helps you form a bond , and it gives them a sense of responsibility . Always make sure that you choose different students for each task . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " never pick him . " <h> 3 . Teachers ' Lounge <p> Before you take your first lunch break , ask your cooperating teacher whether volunteers are welcome in the teachers lounge . Some staffs welcome everyone in the teachers lounge . However , most staffs have an understanding or even a rule preventing non-teachers from taking their breaks there . <p> Because teachers have so little planning time , lunch often is the only time they have to hold meetings with their colleagues . These informal meetings often focus on confidential issues such as school politics and issues regarding individual students . It 's difficult for teachers to discuss these matters when someone 's parent is eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich next to them . Most administrators do not take their breaks in the lounge for this reason , so do n't feel insulted if you 're not made to feel welcome in your school 's lounge . <h> 4 . Bulletin Boards <p> When I was pregnant and had no volunteer , I still had a Halloween bulletin board up in my classroom when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often need the most help with them , bulletin boards are a stitch in almost every teacher 's side . Coming up with original ideas and then finding the time and energy to actually complete the bulletin boards is nearly impossible . So keep your mind open to ideas for bulletin boards , and share those thoughts with your cooperating teacher . Offer to make the bulletin boards a regular job that you can complete each week or each month . <h> 5 . Be Open-minded <p> Try not to judge the teacher 's teaching methods and discipline strategies , especially during your first few volunteer sessions . It may appear as if the teacher has a diverse range of expectations for individual students regarding discipline and academics . But keep in mind that the teacher knows confidential details concerning the students ' academic abilities , domestic situations , and medical information that may affect behavioral and academic performance . <h> 6 . Boundaries <p> Before you start your volunteer experience , have a clear idea of what your personal boundaries are . Are you comfortable having the students refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to be called Mr. or Mrs. ? Are you willing to discuss aspects of your personal life such as your spouse and children ? <p> Children ask adults a lot of personal questions in an attempt to bond . Because children are developing social skills , they are still learning the difference between appropriate and inappropriate questions . I usually answer personal questions that are within my own comfort level as long as they are asked during suitable times such as recess or between lessons . If a child asks a question that I do n't want to answer , I let him know in a polite way . <h> 7 . Communication <p> It may be difficult to find time during a busy school day to actually talk with the teacher , so if you have any questions or concerns , let the teacher know that you need to set up a time to talk . You might want to ask your cooperating teacher for her e-mail address in case you need to contact her between your scheduled volunteer days . <p> Always let the teacher know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project the wrong way creates more work for the teacher than taking a few minutes to ask questions during the process . <h> 8 . Behavior Plan <p> Most schools have a discipline plan with clear-cut consequences for negative behavior and rewards for positive behavior . Many teachers add to the schoolwide guidelines by making a more specific behavior plan for their classroom . Know the method that your cooperating teacher uses to handle positive and negative behavior , and know what role you will play in that plan . Try to follow the behavior plan as closely as possible to the way the teacher does . This will prevent a good cop , bad cop scenario . <h> 9 . Grading <p> Ask the teacher to explain her grading system and the part she would like you to take in the process . Does she want you to help collect homework and class work and to mark correct and incorrect answers ? If you are to mark answers , is there a system for establishing a grade ? Do n't be surprised if your cooperating teacher prefers to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to complete all grading in their classroom to keep their assessment process consistent and confidential . <h> 10 . Special Needs Students <p> Every class has individual students who need more help than the teacher can provide on any given day . These students may have behavior problems , learning disabilities , or personality traits that cause them to need extra attention from an adult . Ask your cooperating teacher which students you can help . <p> Any time you do n't have something to do , assist one of these students with whatever task they may be struggling with . I find it most useful when a volunteer helps needy students during transition times such as walking to art , snack time , or getting unpacked and organized at the start and end of lessons . You 'll be surprised at the positive difference you can make in a child 's life by extending just a few minutes of your individual attention . <p> And remember , volunteering in the classroom is one of the most important things you can do to help build a strong community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped by the people who come into his life , if only for a brief moment .

You 'll have to see the rules in your state . <p> One question is " what is a raffle " . Absolutely it includes the type of fundraiser where you have printed tickets for a prize that are bundled and pre-sold by volunteers . At some point a a winner is drawn for a major prize .

Yes , a cop out . But seriously - " consult a lawyer " ? <p> Yes , you need a license . But do n't let that stop you , they are easy and inexpensive to get . The laws and procedures vary by state .

Do a google search for " gaming license information for non profits in " list your state " . Most state governments have web pages with this information . <p> Serendiptity is right . My answer may have made it sound like it 's " hard " to do a raffle . And that 's not usually true . You just need to be aware of and follow the rules . In our case , we do n't even need a license or pay a fee . <p> In our state , there are specific rules about the fact that the prize ca n't be cash or exceed some value ( big , like $50K or something ) , who can hold a raffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ticket , and how the tickets can be sold .

I have been elected as Treasurer for the upcoming year for the new PTO . In asking questions I have come to realize that our organization is not a 501c3 and they have for years not operated under the school . In trying to move forward , individuals from all three Boards are involved which is proving to be very complex . I am a CPA and after doing much research , I have brought to the attention of all Board Members that we should incorporate , obtain an EIN , and 501c3 status and move forward . However , the school has presented the option of the PTO operating under the schools tax I 'd through use of a seperate General Ledger number . Any funds we make would be deposited into a school owned account and any expense we need to incur would have to go through the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally disagree with this as even an option . However , the majority of the current Board members from the two seperate PTOs are against moving forward with the non-profit route and think that we should just take the easy way out and operate under the school . It has become a halting point preventing us from moving forward to plan for next year . I am new to dealing with PTO related issues and not an expert in such field . But everything in my accounting background tells me that this is an inappropriate route to take . I will point blank ask , is it illegal for a PTO or parent led organization to operate under the use of a public schools tax I 'd ? From every thing that I understand , if ANY organization has over $5,000 in gross receipts ( not income ) per year , it should be reporting to the IRS . This tells me that the organization should be seperate . If it was a student organization such as FHA or cheerleading , I could see them operating under the school . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base and totally wrong in my perception of the way things need to be done to be ethical and legal ? I read a lot of what appears to be opinions , but is this truly an option ? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated if you have ever expierenced the same issue . <p> Craig writes:It 's not illegal to operate as , essentially , a committee of the school . It 's a big tradeoff , though . You give up all autonomy . You do n't have bylaws ; you have rules -- that the school can decide to change at any time . If the school decides to spend your playground equipment fund on office products and cleaning supplies , there 's nothing you can do about it . If the principal decides he wants to appoint the president rather than hold elections , you wo n't have much recourse . Those are extremes and many groups do operate as committees of the school , but if you go that route you should know what you 're giving up . In general I 'd say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal has a good relationship with the parent group .

@@35479101 @4479101/ <h> QuickBooks and Form 990--EZ <p> I 'm trying to find out the best way to set up our PTO on QuickBooks Pro 2005 ( we do n't have the non-profit version ) to satisfy both our reporting needs and Form 990-EZ . Any ideas ? Would Microsoft Money be any better ? I have a version of that , too . Thanks in advance for sharing your experience and expertise . <p> I 've never used Quickbooks , but I 've at least looked at MSMoney and I 've filled out the 990-EZ a couple of times ( with Quicken as our accounting system ) . I doubt there 's little advantage one over the other with respect to 990EZ . Basically , it comes down to how you identify and isolate certain types of income and expenses that the IRS requires you to report . And any basic accounting system will let you set up your own custom categories to meet your needs . <p> For example ( and do n't quote me on this specific example - this stuff does n't stay in my brain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues separately from other income . So , it would be easier for you to make a category specifically for dues in your accounting system so you can pull out the number later . <p> One issue I remember bumping into was needing to isolate our expenses to the fundraising companies . You have to report Gross and Direct Expenses on the form . In our PTO , for ease of monthly reporting , we post both debits and credits to the same fundraising category so we always show a net figure in our regular reports . That 's very useful day to day , but I had to manually pull out the debits when I prepared the 990EZ . Not a big deal - I 'd rather do that once a year than give up visibility of real-time net profit . You also need to pull together all your program service expenses ( ex : staff appreciation , assemblies , classroom supplies , enrichment programs , etc. ) into one lump on the form . So if you have access to a custom field for each category , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it applies to . Then , ideally , you could extract the category totals at year end and sort then by form line # . Again , it 's not a huge big deal to do it manually , but this trick might save a little work , especially in subsequent years . <p> OK , I 'll stop ... information overload ! This is dull reading even to me ! <p> You 're smart to be thinking about this before you set up your system . If you have n't already , you can download a copy of the Form 990EZ and its instructions from the IRS 's website . You can also find an article about how to fill out the form in the April 2004 issue of PTOToday magazine . It is also included in the Treasurer Toolkit manual you can order from this website . <p> Thanks , Critter . Your advice is very helpful and consistent with what I 've heard from others . One tip I picked up somewhere was to set up the first two digits of the account code to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort the data at year-end for , theoretically , easy input . I 've seen in your other posts that you were offering examples of monthly reports . If that offer is still open , could you send them to me at This email address is being protected from spambots . You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ? Thanks again . <p> Some data actually gets reported on more than one line of the Form 990EZ / Schedule A. Coding your account numbers ( which our system calls " categories " ) might get you part way , but I think you might still have some manual manipulation . I 've done the 990EZ the first time for two different PTO 's - it 's GOT TA be easier to do it in subsequent years if you keep good notes and document the cross reference from your accounting system to the fields on the form . If it passes the IRS 's review once , hopefully the same logic will pass in future years . <p> I just found the old excel I used - I extracted the quicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and totaled .

No more appointments by your principal . Good luck . <p> Our by-laws are reviewed every three years and if any changes are recommended they are presented to the membership and adopted by majority vote . Changes can also be made at any time with prior notice given to the membership . There is no place on the document for signatures . I am not sure any are required because the membership adopts the by-laws not any individual or committee . <p> I am amazed that your principal wants to appoint his own board . Our by-laws provide for rules as to how the board is elected , when elected and for how long of a term . In reality our principal is not a member of the PTO - being neither a parent nor a teacher .

Then other questions began to arise . Why is there no phone number on thier website ? Why are there only " Boosterthon guys " and no girls ? What kind of charity work is CTW ( the charity wing of Boosterthon mentioned on thier website ) doing ? What do the character lessons consist of ? Who are these men ?

No one wants to be stuck doing the work of six people alone , and your group needs leadership to thrive . <p> But what do you do if no one is stepping up ? This is one of the most frustrating challenges a group can have . The good news is , if you find yourself in this position , there are steps you can take to get the help you need : <p> - If there are feeder schools ( in other words , the level below your current school ) , talk to PTO leaders there . <p> - Hold an event for incoming kindergarten parents . Scope out their interest in leadership . <p> - Hold off on looking until back-to-school time , when everyone is more energized . <p> - Look outside your normal channels . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a retired teacher , for example ) ? <p> - And if you take these steps and still find yourself short , it might not be the worst thing to go without . If you 're short a treasurer , see if the school business staff can help out . If you need a secretary , ask somebody to take notes at the beginning of each meeting . If you need a president , choose a different chair for each meeting . Work by consensus , and make sure everyone knows what tasks they are assigned when the meeting ends . <p> Can a PTO exist without a President ? Our bylaws do n't mention anything about what to do if the president position is vacant . Nomination forms for the upcoming school year have gone out but have n't seen any interest .

" I was relieved to learn that Jack would be all right . " <p> But his fall could have been worse , and proper safety surfacing " both proper installation and proper upkeep " is a key factor in preventing the most serious of playground injuries . If your school is planning a new playground , safety surface planning should be a key element of your design . If your school has an aging playground , maintaining safety surfaces should not be forgotten . <h> Helping prevent the most serious injuries <p> At its most basic , safety surfacing is a cushion that can absorb some of the impact of falls . While grass may be considered soft and comfortable , the dirt just beneath grass is actually quite hard and potentially dangerous . In its place , safety experts recommend surfaces with " give " " most commonly , engineered wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , sand , loose gravel , or rubber matting . At proper depths , safety materials lessen the chances of life-threatening ( mainly head ) injuries at your playground . <p> It 's important to note that no surface can guarantee safety , especially against orthopedic injuries like broken wrists and ankles . In many cases , these injuries result more from awkward falls than from falls of great height or speed . Government and industry safety standards instead concentrate on the likelihood of life-threatening injuries and measure things like g-forces ( acceleration due to gravity ) and HIC ( head injury criteria ) to recommend minimum depth of safety surfacing for particular playgrounds . Safety recommendations are generally based on the maximum height of your playstructure , as the distance a child falls is the most important factor in the g-force and HIC measurements . <p> There is no single best surface for your playground . Factors like weather , the availability of maintenance staff , and even budgets play a role in that decision . Your local playground representative can certainly guide you carefully through the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on its site . <p> " In choosing appropriate protective surfaces , you should take a look at the long-term issues involved and not make decisions on today 's costs alone , " recommends Rick Henke , president of Goric Marketing , a playground distributor in Holliston , Mass .

Factors to include : resiliency , wheelchair accessibility , heat absorbency , and even reaction to frost , especially in the North . " <p> While playgrounds offer hundreds of options for the shopping PTO " slides , swings , ladders , colors " playground surfacing is much more basic , and perhaps much more important .

@@35479116 @4479116/ <h> Cochair Survival Skills <p> **25;552;TOOLONG <p> Working in tandem does n't have to be difficult . Following a few simple guidelines will help you reap the many benefits of having a partner . <p> by Christy Forhan <p> 11/16/2015 <p> Two people , one job . It sounds so powerful . Two people sharing the responsibilities and the rewards of a single position . It 's called job-sharing in the business world . For parent groups , it takes the form of cochairpeople or even copresidents . Think about it : Two people can accomplish so much more than one . By sharing the tasks , neither person gets overburdened or burned out . And time constraints become less of a concern . When one person is unavailable , the other simply steps in . <p> A cochairing relationship can be great , and it can work just like that . But a dysfunctional cochair relationship can easily degrade into a frustrating tangle of miscommunication , duplicated efforts , and dropped balls . Styles clash . Arguments boil up over seemingly trivial decisions . One chairwoman is stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call , and the bad feelings spill out to the general committee volunteers . So how do you make sure your cochair or co-officer arrangement is the positive kind and not the negative ? <h> Accentuate the Positive <p> The potency of successful cochairs far exceeds the possible negatives . At its best , an event or project is completed on time , within budget , and to the resounding accolades of the students and school community . Both volunteers feel satisfied knowing they pulled together to put on a great event . Along the way , they 've strengthened their friendship by working closely together , and no one feels burned out . " I think the biggest plus to a cochair is sharing the load and not feeling so overwhelmed , " says Tracey Shelton , a PTA member at Abbotts Hill Elementary in Alpharetta , Ga . For large projects especially , cochairing can be an effective training process . " It 's great for a mentoring situation where a seasoned volunteer grooms a new volunteer to take over the project the following year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTA in Walled Lake , Mich . And , she adds , " If one person has a situation where they are unable to fulfill their commitment , then there 's someone already up to speed who can keep the project on task . " <p> Cochairing establishes a partnership that allows each volunteer to apply her respective talents . The synergy created can inspire fresh ideas , too . Here are a few tips to ensure that your cochairs stay friendly and productive through it all . <p> Divide the responsibilities clearly . Start by agreeing on how you will divide the work . For a complex project like an auction or carnival , be specific and write it down . If you 're not sure of the tasks involved in your project , speak to the past chairwoman , review the project files , and brainstorm . Make sure your committee volunteers know the division of responsibility , too , so they know which cochair to call with questions . Koshen suggests dividing the tasks based on each person 's strengths and weaknesses . As half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did a lot of face-to-face solicitation for donations , whereas my cochair preferred to do more of the organizational aspects . " Shelton echoes the sentiment . " I cochaired a book drive at our school . It worked out well in part because I was new to the school and the other mom knew her way around . " Randa Murray , cochair of the printer cartridge recycling program at Scotch Elementary PTO in West Bloomfield , Mich. , suggests sharing the dud jobs equally , too . " We take turns handling the large laser cartridges that get recycled . They 're messy and a pain to prepare for shipping . " <p> Communicate frequently . Successful cochairs talk with each other often . As issues arise , you need to discuss , decide , and move on . " Communication is probably the biggest key to our success , " says Debbie Ramsey , Murray 's cochair at Scotch Elementary . " We do n't assume ; we ask . " Adds Murray : " We copy each other on every email , every note we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our files are complete so next year 's chairperson has all the information she needs to get started quickly . " <p> Be reliable . Do what you say you 'll do , and share the load equally . That 's a basic expectation of a cochair relationship . Otherwise , you 'd have a single committee chairperson and an assistant . Give your cochair time to regroup if you discover that you 're having trouble doing your part . Once tasks are assigned , a cochair should be confident that her counterpart will do what she has agreed to . Do n't leave your partner with a mess if you bail out unexpectedly . Teresa , a parent group leader who asked to be identified only by her first name , found out the hard way that her cochair did n't have time to devote to their PTO 's family game night . You need " someone who is responsible enough to get the job done when they say that they will , " she says now . <p> Stay on task . Resist the temptation to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort and possible hurt feelings by sticking to your scope of responsibilities . Feel free to offer advice , but do n't push her aside . <p> Does it matter who you " co " with ? Given the option , " I prefer to pick my cochair as opposed to being assigned a cochair , " Koshen says . " I 'm a detail person-some would say perfectionist-which makes it challenging for me to work with someone who 's more casual . In one case in particular , I felt the need to redo some of my cochair 's work , but I did n't want to hurt her feelings . It was an uncomfortable situation because we had such different styles . " Shelton adds , " Even with a cochair , I think someone ultimately steps up and does a bit more . You are always going to have one cochair who is checking things off a list to make sure they are completed . " The trick is to get the work done without being dismissive of your partner . <p> Be flexible . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compromise once in a while . This is n't a contest to see who can accrue the most decision points . If you 're sharing the authority , you may have to give in once in a while . Just do n't lose sight of your real focus : the students . <p> Amy , who asked not to be identified , was active in her school 's PTO when she decided to cochair the staff appreciation committee with another active volunteer . " We knew each other , so we assumed we could easily share the responsibility , " she says . But the women quickly discovered that they each had specific ideas about what staff appreciation entailed . Neither woman 's ideas were necessarily better ; they were just different . " We should have divided the responsibilities right at the start , but instead we got hung up on trivial matters like tablecloths and luncheon favors . It was hard to compromise because we both felt we were in charge , " Amy says . " We had some tense conversations , but we finally agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still friends , but I learned firsthand how important it is to be flexible when cochairing. "

@@35479124 @4479124/ <h> Scrip Fundraising : How It Works <p> **25;606;TOOLONG <p> It has a funny name , but scrip fundraising can be a powerful tool . <p> by Alicia Miller and Tim Sullivan <p> 01/05/2016 <p> Picture this : You make your usual yearly sojourn for new school clothes . You fill the dressing room bench as usual " with polo shirts and cargo pants , belts and sweaters " and head to the register with whatever fits ( and , of course , is also cool ) . Your selections are rung up and folded , and you pay a grand total of $400 . Guess what ? You just earned $28 for your kids ' school . On the way home , you pick up a video and a pizza . That 's another $1 for good old Anyschool Elementary . <p> How is this possible ? Welcome to scrip . <p> The concept is simple : Schools purchase gift certificates , or scrip , from popular retailers at a discount , which the retailers are happy to give because they 're guaranteeing themselves customers and some goodwill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school at face value . The difference in price is kept by the school . Parents spend the scrip at the retailer , where it 's worth the full face value ; they have n't spent an extra dime to help the school , nor have they had to change stores . <p> And school earnings can really add up . The most successful scrip schools get hundreds of thousands of dollars per year from scrip . Typical schools with modest programs can earn $3,000 to $10,000 without an undue amount of effort . <p> Some quick math is the best way to demonstrate the earning potential of scrip . Say a family with one child in elementary school and one in middle school spends $1,200 on school clothes every year . The school gets a 7 percent discount on certain retailers ' scrip . During that year , the school would make $84 ( 7 percent of $1,200 ) from one family 's clothing bill . Now consider what that same family might spend on pizza and gas and toys , items with typically higher discount percentages . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings by , say , 20 families , and you have $5,000 or more for your school . <p> As with any outside vendor your group may work with , you want to make sure your scrip vendor 's business is sound . Some signs that a scrip vendor might be in trouble include missed delivery dates , long holds for customer service , and increasingly frequent reports that the company is " reviewing its orders with merchants . " But groups can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a failing company by being cautious , staying on top of orders , and even splitting orders among several brokers . <p> " Do n't be afraid to ask financial questions about the business , " recommends Dave Burgess , vice president at Great Lakes Scrip . " An open line of credit , the fact that a bank is willing to loan them money , is usually a sign that it is a healthy outfit . " <h> Scrip Tips <p> While the impressive returns from scrip are very real , there 's still no such thing as completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning potential and for the fact that parents do n't have to spend an extra penny to help your school ( they do n't have to buy or pay more , they just have to buy differently ) , successful scrip volunteers do spend a lot of time on their programs . <p> But though the prospect of starting a huge new fundraising effort may be daunting , a scrip program can be run more simply . Follow these pointers and you 'll be on your way : <p> Choose your scrip broker carefully . Scrip from national retailers can be purchased at very similar discount percentages from all the scrip centers , but the real differences crop up on the list of second-tier or regional retailers . Be sure a scrip center 's retailer list is a good fit for the shopping habits of your supporters before deciding on a scrip vendor . <p> Start small . The beauty of scrip is that it does n't take hundreds of supporters to see solid rewards . Nearly every school has 10 to 15 folks who take on the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to purchase , you can earn thousands . And from that success you can slowly add more people and more retailers to your mix . <p> Grow slowly . Add to your core group one friendly face at a time . It makes managing your program easier , and it 's realistic . You may be a regular Shakespeare when it comes to writing fundraising letters , but folks do n't readily send in weekly checks in exchange for gift certificates . There 's a show-and-tell element and some hand-holding required for each new regular . Remember : You 're asking supporters to change a long-held pattern . It 's not nearly as simple or as widely recognized as a candle sale . <p> Consider profit-sharing . Almost all of the big scrip schools " those making $50,000-plus per year in scrip earnings " use some element of profit-sharing to encourage/require participation . A typical scenario allows a family to apply 10 percent or 20 percent of the dollars it raises toward school tuition or an activity fund . This option is obviously more common in parochial and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the " share " percentage can be credited toward a particular homeroom or activity . Some schools even require that families purchase a certain amount of scrip or face an additional activity fee . Such programs certainly increase participation and earnings . <p> Despite the initial difficulty of getting people to change their shopping routine , in the end scrip works for two reasons : The participating retailers are stores where your supporters already shop all the time , and your supporters can help your school without spending an extra dime . It 's a nice combination . If you can find a group of supporters ( even just a small core group , at first ) willing to change their shopping habits , you could be on your way to a successful scrip fundraiser . And your shopping trips may never be the same . <p> I would promote it as a way to buy what you usually buy and spend what you usually spend , but support the school at the same time -- win-win . Then send families to a webpage to get more details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that messaging . Also , you might do a push before the holidays -- that can be a good time to get people interested . <p> In the end , though , scrip is a somewhat complicated concept for simple marketing , and getting families involved generally requires a conversation to help people better understand the program . Promoting it in person at events can often be more productive than broad communications . <p> Thank you for this article , we have not had a scrip program before and in trying to get one started , the different companies confuse me . The other thing I am hearing is that even though the money made is a % , it LOOKS like a lot of money came in for tax purposes because the parents pay the PTA and the PTA pays for the scrip , making it appear that the PTA made 100% of the cost and then spent it . I 'd like to hear about specific companies people like to use and if they have a solution to that treasury issue . <p> Definitely be careful when choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who have been disappointed with our competitors in terms of order fulfillment . As Canada 's largest gift card fundraising company , FundScrip has built its reputation by maintaining customer service and rapid order fulfillment as the primary focus . <p> Do most schools allow the scrip vendor to automatically make withdrawals from the PTO bank account ? I 'm very hesitant to do so , but at another school in our district , the scrip coordinator thinks it 's critical to have the 1-week turn-around that automatic withdrawals enable ( takes an extra week if you have to mail a check in ) . <p> ( Note : I had asked Dan to comment , as I know he works very closely on scrip in general and this issue in particular . We will try to keep all updated should there be any more clarification on this issue . ) <p> Perhaps biggest point , in 15 years of following scrip , I 've never heard of a case of a parent getting in hot water over scrip tuition reduction plans .

@@35479129 @4479129/ <h> Field Trips : Getting Organized <p> School-led educational outings are primarily the domain of teachers , but parent groups can still play a role in making them fun and successful . <p> by Moira McCarthy <p> It was a sunny afternoon , and as Patricia Meyer of Lancaster , N.Y. , settled her tribe of second-graders onto the bus to head home from another school field trip , she sighed with relief . <p> All had gone well . The museum visit was educational yet engaging for the students . Lunch had been eaten , the trash disposed of with ease . Each child had twirled for a few delightful spins on the surprise merry-go-round ride the teachers and parents had planned . And now , head count complete , they were on the bus , headed back to St. Mary 's Elementary School . Success . <p> Until . <p> Meyer looked back at three of her charges and noticed something . " They were , well , green around the gills , " she says . Before she knew it , even more were feeling bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a year later . " Maybe we should not have chosen to have the amusement ride just after lunch and just before the long bus ride . " <p> Parents like Meyer , who has been active in her three children 's school for five years , have seen a lot of trips and a lot of situations . Butterfly zoos . Museums . Science centers . Historic sites . Parks and ball fields . Not to mention confused kids , cranky teachers , and parent volunteers who forget they are there to help , not just hang with their own children . <p> The concept of field trips has been around at least since the 1800s . Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote vividly of learning walks her class would take out of their one-room schoolhouse . They 'd study rivers , watch the mill work , get out into the world to see how what they were learning in the classroom truly translated . <p> Today , the field trip is an integral part of every child 's educational experience . It 's also no small feat to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three children to , say , the local children 's museum . Then multiply that by as much as 70 . Clear minds , clear planning , and solid been-there-done-that input are a must . <h> When and Where <p> About 70 percent of parent groups nationally say they provide financial support for school field trips . Some give out a set amount of money per student per grade ; others provide " grants " based on requests from teachers or the principal . The decision of where students will go is almost always in the teachers ' hands . But PTOs can play a role there , too , by gathering feedback to help plan for the future and ensure that the money is well-spent . Gathering feedback might consist simply of asking chaperones , parents of children in the class , and the teacher how the trip went and asking the teacher whether she would do it again . Or you might create a more formal process with a written evaluation form . <p> In some cases , parent groups are able to set a broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on culture and literacy , a PTO might allocate money to fund field trips that fulfill that aim . Because different grade levels have different needs , however , it helps to stay flexible and avoid hard-and-fast rules . <p> Either way , do n't be shy about making suggestions " some will be accepted and other wo n't " and also tactfully letting teachers know when a field trip you volunteered for did not meet expectations . <p> " I always hope the kids go on more trips that are a little more special , " says CoCo Glass , mother of four children in the Edina , Minn. , school system . " I like to think that most kids get to go to the zoo already with their families . I like field trips to be somewhere out of the usual , and somewhere that shows them or teaches them something new . " <p> Of course , that same old local zoo can provide plenty of new and exciting opportunities when visited on a school trip . Behind-the-scenes access to some of the animals or private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . More important than whether the site is brand-new or simply seen in a different light , though , is that it be kid-focused . " It is n't enough that adults like it , " says Glass . " You need a destination with guides who talk on the kids ' level , who make it click for them . " <h> Getting On ( and Off ) the Bus <p> Once the location is booked , the buses hired , and the permission slips collected , the chaperones step in . Because the teachers do the preparation and planning , they also generally oversee chaperone selection . Still , parent group leaders should be familiar with how that happens . Is anemail or flyer sent soliciting volunteers ? Are the names of all interested parties put in a hat , with the final list of chaperones chosen by lottery ? Or can teachers simply call parents directly if they want their help ? What happens if there are n't enough volunteers ? <p> There 's no set way for it to go ; every school or district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips , though , you should monitor the process so you can answer questions from parents . Find out from the teacher what she expects of chaperones , and make sure that information gets communicated . Likewise , make sure that parent chaperones understand ahead of time where they 're going , why they 're going , what 's expected of them , and what they should expect of the children . <p> Meyer recommends giving each chaperone a written list of the names of each child she is responsible for . And if you 're a chaperone , she says , " Refer to it constantly . There is no such thing as too many head counts . " Meyer , Gomes , and Glass all recommend that chaperones be responsible for groups of no more than six children . <p> Meyer also believes a packed , disposable lunch is the only real option on a field trip . " Do n't bring along anything that can not be thrown away , " she says . " Then everyone eats , it all gets cleaned up , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomes of Bedford , N.H. , can appreciate that idea . Last spring her third-grade son , Jake , came home from an exciting field trip to Boston with all sorts of stories . One thing was missing , though : his school backpack . <p> " I called the museum and they had it , but they could n't mail it to me , " Gomes says . " And I can understand that . They 'd be mailing backpacks all day . It 's almost a two-hour ride each way , and yet he had things he needed right away in there . We ended up getting one of the museum employees to meet my sister-in-law in a Boston train station , and she got it to us . " <h> Codes of Conduct <p> Successful field trip preparation is also about setting expectations . Meyer talks to her own children about rules and regulations and how they 're expected to behave . She has the same discussion with any children she is responsible for as a chaperone . <p> " It 's particularly important with your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying than when a chaperone 's child is acting up and that chaperone does nothing about it . I tell my children I expect them to behave well and to obey me . I remind them I 'm not just their mom there , I 'm the chaperone and I need their full cooperation . " <p> Chaperone duties can change depending on the age of the children in their charge . " When they are little , " says Glass , " it is more of a physical issue . You have to physically guide them . Get them from one stop to another . Help them have their lunch or get to a bathroom and back . Have them at the right place at the right time . Get them on the bus . With older kids , it 's more about controlling attitudes . I 'm a stickler about rules and manners , and this is what you deal with on field trips with older kids . " <p> Many schools include rules for field trip behavior in the school handbook . If your school does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good role for the parent group . <p> For younger children , simplicity can be key . Meyer and her school use coordinating T-shirts to keep the kids easy to spot and in one group . " We have the gym shirts that say St. Mary 's that all the kids have to have , so on some field trips , we ask them all to wear them , " she says . Some teachers in her school have done " paint your T-shirt " art lessons before field trips , even having each subgroup within the field trip paint their own " team colors . " Simply asking that each child wear a certain color shirt " blue or red , for example " can also be effective . <p> From the parents to the teachers to the kids , everyone gets excited about field trips . It 's a thrill to get out of the usual surroundings and take in education in an unusual way . But the true goal is for children to have fun in a different learning environment , to have their interest piqued about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . With good planning and prepared volunteer leaders , field trips can be educational and memorable for everyone involved . <h> Oh , Behave ! A Primer for Parent Chaperones <p> The Edina , Minn. , school system has a program to teach children about proper behavior , both in and out of school , says parent volunteer CoCo Glass . Before every field trip , students are reminded of the schoolwide values program . It 's also important , though , for chaperones to know the proper way to behave . Below are some basic rules for the next time you 're the one on the bus . <p> Remember that you 're responsible for all of the kids who have been assigned to you , not just your own child . Do n't turn the trip into a school-funded family outing . <p> Count heads , then count them again . <p> Tell your charges what your expectations are " which should in turn be the same as the teacher 's . You are an extension of the teacher when you 're a chaperone . <p> Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the teacher 's domain . If a student is misbehaving , touch base with the teacher as soon as possible . You could say , for example , " I 'm having trouble keeping Sam in line this afternoon .

With budget cuts , the school ca n't manage any further expenditures . You present the case to the members of your parent group , and they decide to do a major fundraiser to supplement the music education program this year . How would you go about implementing this project ? <p> Would you pick the type of fundraiser to undertake , set the goal for the amount of money to raise , appoint a subcommittee , chair it yourself , create a detailed list of tasks to be done , include a time line for who will do what and when , and then see that everything gets done on schedule ? If so , you are a task-oriented leader . <p> If you would ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraiser to do and project how much they think they can raise , then ask for a report back only if they need help or when the project is done , you are a people-oriented leader . <p> The blend of the way you relate to the people in your group and how you accomplish the tasks indicates your leadership orientation . Some people call it " style , " but orientations are more ingrained . Occasionally you may choose to behave differently . But when push comes to shove , we all tend to have a way of leading we are inclined toward . That is our leadership orientation . <p> Research into how leaders behave conducted at several universities , including the University of Michigan , the University of Iowa , and Ohio University , has long pointed to two basic orientations : people-centered and task-centered . People-centered leaders say things such as " Feel free to do it however you think is best " and " Use your judgment . " Most of the time , people-centered leaders let group members set a pace that is comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . <p> If you 're a people-centered leader , you probably try out your ideas with the group and ask for ideas frequently . Your willingness to make changes agreed upon by the group is evident . You want everyone to be happy about doing this job . It does n't much matter how it gets done or even when ; every voice must be heard . <p> For an annual event like teacher appreciation week , a people-oriented leader might ask for volunteers to form a subcommittee . She would let the committee know when the event is usually held but also state that if that did n't seem convenient , it would n't hurt to adjust the time frame . Little information would be offered about what had been done for past teacher appreciation events , and the leader would encourage the group to do whatever felt right . <p> The only caution for the group might be to stay within the allotted budget but to feel free to divide the money as the members saw fit . If anyone asked a question , the leader might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your group . " <h> The Task at Hand <p> Task-centered leaders tend to say things such as " Try harder ! Everyone needs to pitch in more to get this job done . " Or " I want this job done the right way . " Task-oriented leaders often create guidelines ( more like rules ! ) for getting each job done . Rarely would these leaders consult the group members before acting . Instead , a task-oriented leader would let members know what she had decided and would further inform them exactly how the job was to be accomplished , right down to the timetable . <p> If you 're a task-oriented leader , you probably have a very low tolerance for uncertainty or postponement . Endless processing of group opinions and feelings is definitely not your thing . Let 's get this job done ! <p> The task-oriented leader has a very different approach to planning a teacher appreciation event . She would likely appoint a committee , but the members primarily would be asked to perform gopher jobs . Little or no actual planning would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably preplan the entire project , carefully outlining the time line and specific tasks on a calendar . She might allow the committee to have some decisionmaking power in the gift selection for teachers but would have catalogs with items marked from which the group could choose . She would let the group know that final approval by the leader would be required before any purchase was made . <p> Of course , both advantages and disadvantages result from each orientation . Picture these two orientations at opposite ends of a continuum . Leaders who operate habitually at the people-centered extreme may keep people happy at the expense of getting the job done . The group may have a great time , but progress on projects may crawl instead of zooming . On the other hand , the satisfaction with the job and the group that comes from having plenty of input and feeling a sense of belonging can also motivate people to work harder toward group goals , becoming an important advantage . <p> Leaders whose pattern falls near the task-centered end of this continuum may get the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people they depend on , perhaps compromising the ability to function effectively in the future . People who are disenchanted with the leader of a group tend to pull back , sometimes not feeling good about accomplishing goals they had little or no say in setting . The task-centered leader 's job or project is accomplished as efficiently as the limits of her imagination because she removes the surprises that others might impose . <p> Is an orientation a destiny ? Of course not . The advantage of thinking about and recognizing an orientation lies in a person 's ability to modify the way she acts and reacts according to the circumstances . There are situations that demand a more task-oriented , authoritarian approach . Who would you want to follow in an emergency , for example ? It probably would n't be the person who wants to convene a task force or do a survey before directing people to the exits ! <h> Finding Balance <p> In the real world , no continuum exists . One type of behavior does n't cancel out the possibility of the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . In fact , as in so many other areas of life , balance between the two orientations produces the best results . The more you can focus on both areas together , the more effective you will be as a leader . <p> Leaders who have come the closest to achieving that ideal , sometimes called shared leadership , seem to have the highest levels of both morale and productivity within their groups . Practitioners of shared leadership might say things such as " The purpose of our annual teacher appreciation week is to highlight the above-and-beyond work of our teachers and provide recognition and appreciation to the whole staff . " This leader works on articulating the common vision for the group and reminds people about the overall goals . <p> If you are this kind of leader , you are concerned with keeping people on track by facilitating their work , not monitoring every detail . You ask for periodic check-ins regarding progress on the teacher appreciation event , or monthly reports at regular meetings . You ensure that members have the tools they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might provide the catalogs of teacher appreciation gifts but leave the final selection to the committee . Or you might ask for three recommendations to take back to the larger group for a vote . You foster trust and respect among group members , giving credit where it is due and helping keep the group focused . Sometimes you actively lead , and at other times you follow , depending on the situation . <p> People who cultivate their awareness of their inclinations toward one orientation or the other become more skilled at adjusting their behavior to suit both the situation and the needs of the group members . You can avoid the pitfall of assuming that you should always behave in a particular way because it is comfortable . Doing what comes naturally needs to yield to more conscious decisionmaking to lead most effectively . <h> People and Task : The Best of Both <p> The best leaders maintain balance between people and task skills . Here are a few ways to use and improve your skills . Follow these guidelines and you 'll keep things running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on track , remind people why they are there . What is the point of the project or activity , and how does it relate to the PTO goals the group wants to accomplish ? <p> Know your group . Seek out the special expertise , talents , and skills among members , and cultivate their contributions . <p> Delegate , do n't hover . Remember , it 's the product you really should be concerned about , not every detail of how the group gets there . That does n't mean relinquishing responsibility . Establishing benchmarks and a time line and asking for periodic updates creates accountability without nagging or undermining the smaller group 's ownership of a project . <p> Make sure you understand what people want or need . As author Stephen Covey put it in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People , " Seek first to understand , and then to be understood . " People are more likely to respond favorably to your request or direction if they know you have really listened to their concerns and understand what they mean . <p> Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with diverse backgrounds and interests can be quite challenging .

Each time , it has failed . A pro-referendum group is seeking donations from members of the community to cover brochures , flyers , and ads in the local paper to help pass it on the next go-around . Is it OK for our PTO " we 're a registered 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization " to use some funds to help our town pass this referendum ? <p> Elly gets this question as often as she gets " Can we spend our money on a luncheon or gifts for volunteers ? " The answer to that one is a big yes ! The answer to your question is yes , too , but with a few qualifications . <p> While the IRS prohibits nonprofits from supporting individual candidates , the regulations regarding lobbying or influencing legislation ( especially in areas that fit your mission ) are n't as black-and-white . Lobbying is allowed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTO 's efforts or dollars . Example : If your annual budget is $4,000 and you 're forking over $3,000 to lease office space for the referendum campaign committee 's headquarters , Elly says that might spell trouble if you 're audited . <p> The IRS also has certain guidelines for leaders when it comes to issuing public statements . For organizations to remain tax-exempt under section 501(c) ( 3 ) , leaders can not make partisan comments in official organization publications ( in your newsletter or website , for example ) or at official functions . Additionally , leaders who speak or write in an individual capacity are encouraged to clearly indicate that their comments are personal and do not represent the views of the organization . <p> Keep in mind that local political issues , including ballot initiatives and referendums , can make for an emotional and volatile climate among parents in your organization and can exhaust its energy , too . If the referendum has failed four times , Elly 's guess is that there is some strong opposition and that parents at your school are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate could split your group , thus hindering its involvement efforts at the school . <p> To avoid jeopardizing your tax-exempt status or , worse , losing some volunteers , the organization is better off taking the neutral or " educational " approach prescribed by the IRS , namely conducting meetings , preparing and distributing materials , and considering public policy issues in an educational manner . Presenting unbiased information to parents in your newsletter or website or holding forums at the school where parents can listen to both sides and then make an informed decision is likely the best course of action for any PTO.

@@35479146 @4479146/ <h> Communication Tips for Better Involvement <p> How you reach out to parents can help build involvement " or it can work against your group . We 'll help you get it right . <p> by Evelyn Beck <p> 10/02/2015 <p> Every communication from your parent group sends a message to parents about involvement " even if that 's not your intention . If your messages are positive , cheerful , courteous , appreciative , simple , direct , and **25;633;TOOLONG , then you 're telling parents that the PTO will appreciate their efforts and that their time with the group will be enjoyable . <p> On the other hand , if your messages are negative , demanding , scolding , and overly complicated , then you 're turning away parents , who will view your group as unfriendly , unappreciative , and difficult to work with . <p> Every written and oral communication has the potential to encourage or discourage participation in the PTO . So it pays to think about the involvement message you 're sending . <p> First , make sure parents know that you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups make the assumption that if parents want to get involved , they will get involved , and so the group does n't necessarily ask them , " says Kati Hanna , copresident of the Parent Advisory Council at Sierra Vista Primary School in Ruidoso , N.M . The PAC sends out a monthly newsletter that includes calls for specific volunteers , along with a contact person . For example , a request for volunteers for Popcorn Days stresses that no experience is needed , that someone will train the volunteer , that parents can assist as it fits their schedules , and that " any help would be extremely appreciated . " <p> More parents became involved as the PAC issued more specific invitations . " We would n't have been able to remotely get our volunteer base if we did n't communicate and ask , " Hanna says . " There were parents who , there was no doubt in my mind , would have never entered our school , but we made it so easy that they got involved . " <h> Open Lines of Communication <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to volunteer . Pike Creek Christian School in Newark , Del. , has a huge volunteer board in its school lobby . " People pass it and do n't feel any pressure , " says Parent Teacher Fellowship copresident Kristal Courter . " It 's there throughout the year . They can think about it if they want to sign up at the first of the year . If they change their mind , the next day they can take their name off . We talk about the board at all events and remind them about it in most of our communications . " <p> And it does n't hurt to offer perks to potential volunteers . At Sierra Vista , volunteers who work one hour get a free school T-shirt . They can also place free classified ads in the parent group newsletter in a kind of local Craigslist , in which parents advertise services or items for sale . <p> Make your PTO leaders more accessible to parents . On your website , in a brochure , in newsletters , and on a bulletin board at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emails , home phone numbers , and cell phone numbers . <p> However you communicate with parents , be consistent . Send newsletters or emails on a regular schedule so that parents are expecting the contact . In these communications , emphasize what the parent group does for the school . Sierra Vista uses its website to inform parents about when and how the group is meeting its goals . In its newsletter , Forest Park Elementary in Little Rock , Ark. , explains some of the smaller things the PTA does , such as paying for an off-duty police officer to assist with traffic on the first three days of school . <p> Put a lot of effort into recognizing volunteers . Sierra Vista features a " parent volunteer of the month " article and photo in its monthly newsletter . Lamar Middle School in Austin , Texas , thanks individual volunteers in its newsletter after an event . " That 's a critical thing , " says PTA president Michelle Smith . " If you say thank you to parents , that 's all they really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to thank every volunteer . " At South Mountain Elementary in Edgewood , N.M. , where the school mascot is a coyote , parents who volunteer at least two hours with the PTO get their name on a paw print posted on a big board in the entryway of the lobby . <p> One of the most overlooked aspects of communicating a positive involvement message has to do with showing that participating in PTO events can be fun . Sierra Vista creates poster boards with photos of volunteers at previous events . These poster boards are displayed in the lobby and are propped behind the parent group table at special events . " We show that it 's fun and that it 's a united group of Native Americans , Hispanics , Caucasians , and African-Americans , " Hanna says . " They may think the parent group is run by a specific group , but we show that everybody is welcome . " <p> The PTA for Chesak and Martin elementary schools in Lake in the Hills , Ill. , posts photos online for a similar purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the PTA your parents used to know , " says president Dana Wiley . " We show parents helping out at the local pool , or at an open house talking to people or helping to carry boxes . These photos take away the preconceived notion that the PTA is a lot of work and that there 's not a lot of fun involved . And it changes the notion of the type of person who gets involved . " <h> Take Advantage of Technology <p> Many parent groups are successfully using technology to promote involvement . At Sierra Vista , parents who sign up get an email when items are added to the PAC website , and the parent group also makes use of an automated phone-calling system to remind parents about upcoming events . " We say we look forward to every parent coming , and it 's made a big difference , " Hanna says . <p> Lamar Middle School parent leaders plan to start a blog on the website . The PTA president will facilitate the blog during the first year , sending questions posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond . Anticipated questions range from clarifications about the school 's dress code to what to do if a child is being bullied . Lebanon Elementary in Connecticut is launching an electronic discussion board this fall where parents can communicate with the PTA and with each other . " This will allow us to more actively communicate to parents about things that are important to the school , and they may also have ideas , " says PTA president Tom Boone . " I do hope it will spur involvement in the PTA . If people understood more of what we 're doing and had a better opportunity to communicate without having to take extra time away from their families , it would hopefully get them more involved . " <p> Forest Park Elementary has used anonymous electronic surveys to get feedback from parents . " We 're making a big push this year to make sure people feel the PTA can work for them , " says PTA president Cindy Pugh . " We asked what they valued in terms of things we do and where to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the survey results . " <p> Forest Park is also using a service called Event Brite , which allows them to email event invitations to parents , who can click on a link to register . This registration information is then sent in list form to the parent group . The PTA has also used the online service CareCalendar to organize assistance for teachers who were incapacitated for extended periods , with parents signing up to bring food . " I think the electronic communications and creating a ' virtual ' community with our newsletter and website are going to work well for our school and PTA , " Pugh says . " It will serve us to connect with busy parents who feel we are keeping them informed in a way that works for them . Also , it is streamlining our volunteer efforts from processing PTA papers and orders to focusing on events , activities , and students . " She advises a gradual move to electronic communication by starting with a survey or promotional campaign , along with securing permission to send electronic communications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so keep paper as an option for those who need or want it . <p> Remember , too , that transportation and language can be barriers for some parents . The Lamar PTA recruited three bilingual parents to work as translators at programs and for the newsletter . There are also plans to take some programs , such as those about wellness and nutrition , into neighborhoods to engage parents where they live . And the school is part of a grant program through which some parents will train as mentors who will then contact other parents directly to find out about their needs . <p> Do n't overlook opportunities for personal conversations . At Greenwood Elementary in Seattle , a good resource is the school 's social worker , who passes on flyers and reminds parents she works with about upcoming events . Other opportunities present themselves on the playground as parents drop off or pick up their children . " People sometimes have the connotation of the PTA being a clique or full of overbearing parents , " says PTA copresident Deb Fitzpatrick . " And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talking to a parent and another parent will walk up to me and say , ' Hi , Prez , ' and then the first parent will ask what that was about and I 'll say I 'm the PTA copresident . Then that first parent will say , ' I did n't think it was like that . ' - " <h> Keys for Communication <p> Invite parents to get involved . Make sure they know they 're welcome at all PTO activities . <p> Make it easy to volunteer . Use a bulletin board and electronic links where parents can sign up . And be sure to include photos and contact information for all officers and chairpersons on your website . <p> Show volunteers you value them . Being appreciative is key . Offering a perk like a free T-shirt can be a nice touch . <p> Communicate regularly . Send newsletters or emails on a regular schedule so parents expect to hear from you . <p> Tout PTO accomplishments so parents know how the group 's efforts are benefiting the school . <p> Recognize volunteers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their accomplishments , on a bulletin board or in your newsletter . <p> Display photos of volunteers and participants to show that the PTO is fun and inclusive . <p> Use technology to involve parents . If parents at your school are online , you should be , too . Just be sure to keep paper copies of your communications available for those who want or need them . <p> Translate PTO communications for non-English-speaking parents so that they are included . <p> Use person-to-person contact . Recruit school social workers and others to pass on flyers and other sources of information to parents who might not be reachable through regular channels . And never miss an opportunity to engage parents , especially those who might view the PTO as a clique . <p> HI yes communication has always been a big issue with today 's parents with so many different directions and activities . we have seen more engagement in schools that uses more reminders , email sign ups and electronic links . thanks for all the great tips <p> Your tips are very informative .

I 'm in Fort Lauderdale and the kids bake in the sun everyday and they need a little shade in the heat . Anyway ... out PTA , small group with their own agenda , does not want to support and is claiming by national PTA rules that only two fundraisers can be held a year , does n't seem right to me ... But if I can start a PTO also , it would be a way to target our shade project , we need over $ 50,000 to build just three structures . We have some ideas and know we can raise the amount . Any help would be appreciated . <p> 1 . Yes , a school can have any number of groups with any number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> 2 . The national PTA has no such rule , and it 's perfectly permissable for a PTA to raise funds for a shade structure . That said , it 's also perfectly permissable for a group to decide no to . <p> I agree with Renee on -- if you 're really committed to the shade project and the PTA wants no part of it -- then a separate shade organization is better than a separate broad parent organization . <p> To me , one of the key functions of a parent group at a school is to build community and support and involvement around the school . And having two organizations like that is almost self-defeating . It will only confuse average-Joe parents , who wo n't bother figuring out the intricacies of the differences . <p> Our PTO did this a couple years ago to build our playground . We had our PTO but then had a seperate committee just to take care of the playground project . Some of our PTO memebers/officers were on both other were n't but either way it showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had two seperate things parents would just probably not do either because they did n't  want to get " involved " . <p> Good Luck with your project <p> Cindy <p> Cindy&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt; LONG ... /&gt; &lt;br&gt; " People have the right to be stupid , but some abuse the privelege .

@@35479150 @4479150/ <h> When Conflict Splits Your Group <p> Ways to prevent controversy from escalating , and how to bring the PTO back together if it already has . <p> by Darylen Cote <p> It was supposed to be a simple agenda item . What could be more straightforward or less controversial than limiting vending machine snacks to healthier choices ? Whoa ! What a miscalculation . People seemed genuinely attached to the snacks available for their children . Voices rose , tempers flared , arguments ensued . <p> How can you prevent a destructive public argument like this one , or at least redirect it into a more productive encounter ? Although there may be no pat or easy answers that will always bundle into a tidy solution , leaders can employ some skills and strategies to improve the outcomes when group members disagree . <p> Prevention begins with recognizing that conflicts are inevitable whenever more than one person is involved . The ways that conflicts evolve range from simple and straightforward disagreements to emotionally charged , very personal encounters like the vending machine debacle . <p> At best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At worst , the group can pull apart and the relationships that form the PTO community become permanently impaired . Planning ahead for differing points of view can set the stage for better outcomes and avoid the disasters . <p> Ground rules , or group agreements for how members will conduct themselves at meetings , can help head off the worst results of conflict . It is a good idea to create or revisit these group agreements very close to the beginning of your leadership term . Doing so can provide a valuable tool when members disagree . <p> Ground rules can include any items that help the group function , such as beginning and ending on time . Present the idea of ground rules to your group by explaining that inevitably people in groups disagree , and you are sure to have some issues to discuss during the year that will become hot topics . You want people to feel free to express themselves and to do so in ways that allow maximum participation where everyone feels safe and heard . From there , you can conduct a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the group function in a productive , respectful way that includes everyone . Get them started with a few ideas , or let them generate the whole list , to which you can also add any rules you feel are critical . Here are a few that many groups have found useful : <p> Participation is encouraged " everyone 's input is valuable . <p> Everyone has a right to be heard . <p> Only one person speaks at a time . ( Some groups use an object such as a Koosh ball as a talking stick to signify who has the floor . ) <p> Speak only for yourself . Use " I " statements instead of making broad generalizations . <p> No put-downs of people or their ideas . ( " That 's stupid " or " You do n't know what you 're talking about . " ) <p> It 's OK to disagree . <p> Disagree respectfully . <p> If a discussion becomes overheated , the leader may call a time-out , or the item under discussion may be tabled until another meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( This may in fact be in the bylaws , so consult with them to be sure you know whether there are methods already in place that must be used for decisions . ) <p> Your group may think of other guidelines , and the list should be left open so that if a situation calls for it , rules may be added . After asking for additions or refinements of language , you may ask for general consensus or a vote to accept the list . Post the list or even review it briefly at the beginning of each meeting . This gives newcomers a ready reference for group norms , and veteran members get a reminder that we all need sometimes . Some groups have even printed the ground rules as a handout , with a few choosing to have each member sign it like a contract . Either way , managing a meeting becomes simpler when group members have agreed ahead of time how they would like to handle these issues . <h> Keeping the Peace <p> If you get blindsided by an issue such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion gets so heated that the rules are not working , it is up to you to control any damage and to resolve the issue peacefully . You become a kind of moderator or mediator . You may need to assume this role even with ground rules in place ! <p> Understand at this point that people who disagree come to their viewpoints in a variety of ways . They tend to operate out of those perspectives without really stopping to see how another view might be equally legitimate . In fact , neither side may be taking into account the whole picture . One side is sure they have The Facts , but the other side is sure they have The Truth in their camp . How can we get them to stop long enough to understand each other and maybe expand those perspectives ? <p> Roger Fisher and William Ury , in their classic book Getting to Yes , recommend that leaders " separate the people from the problem " and focus on " interests , not positions . " To accomplish this , you may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dispute , to clarify the issue . <p> First , you might restate the positions you hear being expressed by paraphrasing the content . For example , you might say to the person who wants healthier snacks in the machine , " Your position is that children eat what is available . You are concerned with the rising rates of obesity and specifically with what your child eats . Is that right ? " <p> To the person who wants vending machine snack choices left alone , the issues may be very different . In northern Maine or Idaho , the very idea of eliminating an item like potato chips from vending machines might be considered an economic assault . To the person who perceives the issue this way you might say , " So you feel that if we eliminate the chips , we send a message to the children that those choices are ' wrong , ' and the inevitable consequence is that the local potato processing plant that manufactures chips will go out of business . Many people have family members employed there . Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explain her position as you patiently check your understanding . The point is to ensure that all parties feel heard , understood , and respected . Until they do , it is unlikely that progress can occur . <h> Looking for a Win-Win <p> The next step is to look for common ground . New Hampshire-based education consultant Jacquelyn Sowers in her presentations recommends that participants generate a list of their " fondest hopes and greatest fears " around an issue . <p> Asking people to work in smaller groups and report out either hopes or fears ensures greater participation , and additional viewpoints may emerge that can be useful . If points of agreement can be found , you have a basis for beginning a new discussion . Often these lists will echo some part of the mission statement for your PTO . <p> Brainstorming solutions or alternatives is the next step in the process . Here you are looking for what Stephen Covey calls the " win-win " idea in his book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People . You will need to maintain a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how fantastic . <p> Finally , each idea can be analyzed using an objective standard , such as your mission statement or the most recent dietary guidelines or the list of healthy snacks in the school 's health textbook . <p> Hopefully everyone will recognize that their concerns and issues are important to the group . While the solution chosen may not satisfy every concern , the process is fair and respectful , avoiding damaged relationships . <p> Conflict presents PTO groups with the opportunity to grow and coalesce around common goals instead of fracturing . Everyone can not agree all the time , yet everyone can be heard despite disagreement . You as the leader can make that happen .

I guess if a parent had a problem with their child 's picture in the yearbook they would need to speak to the principal about having it left out . We have never had this happen . Last year someone who came to our PTO meeting suggested it might be a good idea to send something home to parents and having it optional to return the form to school opting out of having their child 's picture in the yearbook . <h> Reply to jepto <p> Maybe we need Tim to add an area for " topics that come up every year . " As I recall the consensus of last years discussion , the general belief was that since the yearbook is only distributed to the school community there is no need for a release to print any photos . Your mileage may vary . <h> Reply to KC Swan <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on is any students who have " do not disclose " requests on file with the school . For THEM , you 'd want to make certain including their picture is okay . <p> I 'm not a lawyer , but I have done a bit of research in this area . The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) is a federal law says that schools can not release student information without parents/students ' permission except DIRECTORY INFORMATION . <p> Basically , schools should advise parents of this ( often in the student handbook ) . And if parents want any " directory information " withheld , they need to advise the school in writing . <p> Generally , I think states adopt this pretty much as is , but you might need to check your school districts ' policy . <p> Directory information ( stuff they can disclose unless a parent objects in writing ) includes : <p> Student 's name Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Address Telephone listing Weight and height of members of athletic teams Electronic mail address Photograph Degrees , honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of study Dates of attendance Grade level The most recent educational agency or institution attended <p> Here 's an example of provided by FERPA of the type of notice school districts should supply to parents . Your district should have sent something like this to every family . In our school district , it 's a page of the student handbook that must be signed and returned at the beginning of school . <p> **37;660;TOOLONG <p> Model Notice for Directory Information <p> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) , a Federal law , requires that School District , with certain exceptions , obtain your written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from your child 's education records . However , School District may disclose appropriately designated " directory information " without written consent , unless you have advised the District to the contrary in accordance with District procedures . The primary purpose of directory information is to allow the School District to include this type of information from your child 's education records in certain school publications . Examples include : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ; The annual yearbook ; Honor roll or other recognition lists ; Graduation programs ; and Sports activity sheets , such as for wrestling , showing weight and height of team members <p> Directory information , which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released , can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent 's prior written consent . Outside organizations include , but are not limited to , companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks . In addition , two federal laws require local educational agencies ( LEAs ) receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( ESEA ) to provide military recruiters , upon request , with three directory information categories - names , addresses and telephone listings - unless parents have advised the LEA that they do not want their student 's information disclosed without their prior written consent. ( 1 ) <p> If you do not want School District to disclose directory information from your child 's education records without your prior written consent , you must notify the District in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following information as directory information : Note : an LEA may , but does not have to , include all the information listed below . <p> Student 's name Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Address Telephone listing Weight and height of members of athletic teams Electronic mail address Photograph Degrees , honors , and awards received Date and place of birth Major field of study Dates of attendance Grade level The most recent educational agency or institution attended <p> One more thing - I would suggest you may want to consider sending a form to the parents with " do not disclose " requests on file asking that if they want their child 's picture included to indicate so on the form , sign it , and return it . <p> This is what we do for the school directory . Some parents choose to participate , and then we have permission on file to protect the school in case any problem arises later . <p> In our elementary , the school handles the yearbook , not the PTO . Frankly , I do n't know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent has an objection , they 'll let it be known . But it would definitely be safer to have permission on file if someone also has a do-not-disclose request on file .

@@35479173 @4479173/ 168488 @qwx368488 <h> Question : PTO credit card " good idea or bad ? <h> Our group is trying to decide whether obtaining a credit card would be a good idea . We would use it for everyday purchases , including copy and office supplies , food and prizes at our family fun nights , and even paying our fundraising vendors . What do you think about PTOs having credit cards ? <p> It depends . For parent groups whose members make many and frequent purchases , including the reasons you have outlined , using a credit card certainly has its advantages : <p> The ability to limit out-of-pocket expenses for your volunteers . Let 's not forget , in some cases , a cash layout of even $10 can be a hardship for a struggling parent . Having a credit card available can save a volunteer from this embarrassing scenario . <p> Fewer checks to write . This factor can make balancing your checkbook much easier . But read on for reasons your treasurer might not be thrilled about a credit card . <p> Possible cash incentives or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card merchants waive their annual fee and offer discounts and cash-back rebates for loyal customers . ( Elly says shop around before you sign on the dotted line . ) <p> Elly recommends limiting the card 's authorized users to no more than two people ( a trusted board member and a committee chair ) . With that in mind , you must decide whether having a credit card really gives you the kind of flexibility you 're looking for . It means that one of these two people will have to make all credit card purchases . But take Elly 's advice ; it 's much harder to track purchases and you 're at great risk of loss with more than two authorized users . <p> And while Elly loves using plastic , doing so does comes with inherent risks , such as theft and overspending . Elly recommends taking precautions to reduce the chances of credit card theft or misuse . <p> Insist that the card be used only for expenditures that have been voted on and approved by board members . For example , the carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popcorn machine simply because she and her committee members brought it up in passing in the parking lot last week . <p> Have a preset spending limit . A max of , say , $500 can cap your vulnerability if the card is stolen . Setting a limit high enough to pay thousands of dollars to fundraising vendors carries tremendous risk . Do n't do it . <p> Block any cash-advance options . Elly can not think of one reason why a parent group would need this function . <p> Write " Please Request Picture I 'd " in permanent marker above the signature line on the back of the credit card . This will , in most cases , alert store cashiers to ask the cardholder for an I 'd . ( Elly actually does this with her own personal credit cards . ) <p> Have the billing statement mailed to a board member who 's not on the card . Instruct this member to present the statement at monthly meetings . Your leaders can then review the statement to see whether there has been any questionable activity in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance on time and in full every month . You will avoid interest charges and penalties associated with late payments . <p> Collect all receipts from authorized users . Be sure you can match expenditures against the statement each month . <p> This last item is also one of the drawbacks of having a credit card " it can create a lot more work for your treasurer . People who use the card do n't have a lot of incentive to turn in the receipts , so the treasurer ends up trying to track them down , figure out what the purchases were , and classify them appropriately . In addition , with a low limit , you run the risk that the card will be maxed out at times . <p> If you feel the risks of owning a credit card probably outweigh the benefits , a relatively new alternative is a prepaid , refillable bank card . This gives appointed shoppers a predetermined amount of credit to purchase items and supplies . The advantage is that you can limit your exposure by putting a specific amount on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a problem . 168491 @qwx368491 <p> badpants writes:Another option would be purchasing gift cards for vendors you frequent .

How to find out , and keep your legal records up to date . <p> by Sandra Pfau Englund <p> 08/11/2015 <p> When I was elected president of the grade school PTO this past spring , I was told that the group was a nonprofit , tax-exempt corporation . I soon learned not to take anything for granted ; neither the state nor the IRS had ever heard of our PTO . I learned a valuable lesson : It 's important to check the legal status of your parent group and to make sure all the records are up to date . <h> Corporate Status <p> To find out whether your group is incorporated , you can first check to see whether a corporate database exists on your state 's website . I typically start at Findlaw.com , a great legal portal . <p> On this site you can click on " Browse by Jurisdiction " under the " For Legal Professionals " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Government Information . " From here you 'll need to look for the state 's corporations office . Frequently the corporations office is found under the Secretary of State . Other times it 's a stand-alone office . In Virginia I find it by clicking on " Independent Agencies " and then " Corporation Commission . " <p> Once at the corporation site , you usually can find a searchable corporate information database . In Virginia it 's called the " Clerk 's Information System . " That is because often ( but not always ) it is the job of the clerk of the corporations office to file and keep records of corporate documents . <p> If you 're less Internet savvy , call your state 's office of the Secretary of State and ask how you can find out whether your PTO is incorporated . <h> Federal Tax-Exempt Status <p> It 's also a good idea to check whether your PTO has applied for and received recognition from the IRS as tax-exempt under the federal tax code . Federal tax exemption excuses the group from paying federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules require that all individuals and organizations file the appropriate tax return if gross income is $5,000 or more . Without IRS recognition of tax-exemption , an organization can not be sure whether it is exempt from paying federal income taxes on any net income . <p> To check federal tax-exempt status you can go to the IRS website . Once there , type " Publication 78 " in the search box and then click on " search now .

Do parents at your school think of your parent group as fun ? Do your volunteers have fun while they 're doing all the hard work ? Are there smiles and laughs and good memories associated with your group ? <p> Or is it all seriousness and drama and bylaws and hitting up folks for money and then more money ? <p> If it 's the latter " if your group lacks a fun quotient " then almost all of your other efforts will struggle mightily . It may sound shallow , but working hard to make your group more fun may be the most important thing you can do to change your group for the better . <p> Why does fun matter so much ? The fact is that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your school . You want them to volunteer . You want them to attend your events and support your fundraisers . You want them to be a part of the community you 're building in support of your school . <p> But you have a ton to compete with .

You 're competing against second jobs and helping the kids with homework . <p> Your biggest competition might just be that very comfy couch in the den , and American Idol and Dancing With the Stars and Survivor . That 's right , you and Simon Cowell in a cage match . ( Hint : If you 're not fun , he 's winning . ) <p> Most parent groups tell me that increasing involvement " getting more parents connected with their group " is their number one goal , and yet those same groups spend little time actively working on making their group more attractive to all parents .

But if your group is dreadfully boring or serious or ( worse yet ) filled with drama , then they 'll find ways to stay away . You probably do it yourself with groups that just do n't get you jazzed up . <p> The best way to seem more fun is actually to be more fun . It 's OK to tell a few jokes . It 's OK to go out after meetings for some socializing at the Starbucks or " egad ! " the local tavern . It 's OK to have a PTO bunco night . It 's more than OK to spend some of your budget dollars making your family events even better . Go ahead , pony up for that great DJ with the laser show . <p> I can also speak for all parents when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every meeting " put them on your website if you 'd like " and to limit debate even if Mrs. Chatty is on a roll . <p> The good news is that this focus on lightening things up has very real benefits . Making things more attractive means more attendees at events . More attendees at events eventually means more volunteers . Serving more parents and keeping things fun even means more support for your fundraisers . More fundraising success means more good work you can do for your school and even more you can invest in fun . And what 's more fun than all that ? <p> Great article , it 's often forgotten that PTO volunteering needs to be fun if it is to attract greater numbers . Parents are ever more stretched nowadays , and their free time is precious . Although PTO volunteering is a worthy cause , it definitely helps if it 's enjoyable too !

Are there back to school booklets for high schools ? <p> Craig writes:High school PTOs do n't generally drive the kind of big involvement numbers that elementary school PTOs do . The reason is that there are a lot of other avenues of involvement in a high school , and activities are splintered in a way they are n't in elementary or even middle school . Booster clubs , sports teams , drama program , the band , etc. all call on parents for assistance . That does n't mean you ca n't get people engaged and accomplish some meaningful things for the school , though . The key is to look at the whole school and think about how the PTO fits in . Then use that information to set your mission and goals . One strong role for a high school PTO can be to facilitate communications between the administration and parents . You can provide information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . You can run a few large-scale events ( or support them ) that build school pride and create tradition . Bottom line , it depends on what your school needs , and that differs from high school to high school . Regarding the role of the principal , that does n't change so much . He should act as an advisor , help you set priorities , and decide how to spend money the PTO donates to the school . He should n't run the PTO , choose the officers , or dictate how the PTO spends its money . Regarding back-to-school , our program is aimed at grades k-8 , mostly because involvement changes so much in high school .

The contributions are optional and the parent can specify the amount and who it goes to . After collecting the money , the PTO purchases a gift card in the amount collected for each teacher or staff and presents to them before the holiday break ... a teacher may get $1,000 and a janitor may get $500 .

@@35479196 @4479196/ <h> 13 Keys to Strong Involvement <p> A step-by-step guide for PTO and PTA leaders who want to reach out and engage more parents . <p> by Christy Forhan <p> 09/28/2016 <h> 1 . Start on the Bottom Rung <p> Think of parent involvement as a ladder . Your first task is to get people to step onto that bottom rung . You want them to move from no involvement to some involvement . Once you get a parent interested and connected to the school , you can move him up to higher rungs : occasional volunteer , frequent participant , even committee chair or officer . But people rarely go from no involvement to president . They take one step at a time . <p> How do you get them on the ladder ? You might sponsor a free family potluck picnic just before school starts . The event would encourage parents , students , and teachers to mingle in a fun , stress-free environment . No fundraising , no signup sheets , no membership recruitment ; just fellowship . You could establish a welcome committee to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . A boohoo breakfast for kindergarten moms dropping off their children on the first day of school can build rapport between the newest members of your parent community . A Dads Club is a great way to engage fathers in the school community . <h> 2 . Make Involvement Easy <p> If you want people to participate , it 's crucial that you make it easy for them . People are just shy enough or just busy enough or just uninformed enough that the slightest obstacle to involvement can become an insurmountable barrier . Take away the predictable barriers and your group can flourish . They do n't have time ? Keep events short and to the point . They do n't know who to call ? Include names and phone numbers on every parent group correspondence . They do n't know anyone ? Develop a new parent mentor system , where veteran parents reach out to newcomers . They are n't sure where they 'll fit in ? Distribute committee descriptions . They lost the sign-up sheet ? Post information in a variety of channels , repeated several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for not getting involved in your group , then target those areas for improvement . This might require harsh scrutiny of your group 's inner workings . But if you 're serious about increasing parent involvement , you need to make it easy for parents to say yes . <h> 3 . Serve a Buffet <p> Provide lots of different ways parents can get involved . If there 's a smorgasbord of choices , it 's more likely that something will appeal to each person . Break big jobs into little ones so the tasks are n't overwhelming . Identify jobs that can be done at home . Differentiate between one-time projects and responsibilities that continue throughout the year . Indicate projects that require the use of a committee and those that are best handled by an individual working on her own . Describe the skills needed for each task : organizational , analytical , creative , social , technical , physical , etc . And let people know how much time they 're committing to for each job . Tell them that getting involved does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or two a semester helps . <h> 4 . Pop the Question <p> Possibly the single most effective way to increase parent involvement is to ask people personally to help . Most people have a natural desire to be helpful , but for a variety of reasons they find it difficult to take the first step . Personal contact , either a face-to-face chat or a telephone conversation , is hard to beat . It allows you to immediately counter any objections and address any concerns people express . It also sends them the message , " You , Mr. or Mrs. Parent , are so important to our school 's success that I am calling you personally to encourage you to get involved . " People like to be noticed , and many reciprocate that attention by saying yes . <h> 5 . Make the Call <p> Could this happen in your group ? A parent new to the school signs her name on a couple of PTO committee lists . And then she waits for someone to call her . And waits . And waits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , without her help . Then the questions come . " I ca n't believe nobody called . Did I miss some meeting ? Was I supposed to contact someone ? Did n't they want me to get involved ? Are they just a clique ? " <p> When people put their names on a sign-up sheet , it 's important to call them . Even if it 's awkward that there 's only one new name on the committee , call her and introduce yourself . Even if there really , really is n't enough work to go around , call all the volunteers and thank them for signing up . Even if your committee wo n't be starting work for several months , call everyone right now and explain the timeline . A voice contact , even if it 's on an answering machine , let 's your volunteer know you have her name and she wo n't be ignored . <h> 6 . Talk the Talk <p> If you make it easy to get involved , provide lots of options , and recruit some people directly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer base . But you need to communicate on a broader scale , too . <p> Do n't assume that everyone knows what your parent group does . Instead , get the word out . Start the school year by distributing an upbeat welcome packet that explains all about the parent group . Take care to thoughtfully design this important marketing tool . <p> Throughout the year , use many different forms of communication , including email , website , social media , backpack notes , phone calls , outdoor signs , indoor displays , even local television . Clearly articulate your message , explain why this is something your audience should pay attention to , and repeat your messages in several formats . <h> 7 . Make It Fun <p> Enjoyment is contagious . Most people want to be part of a group that has fun while accomplishing its goals . Be upbeat and stress the positive , even if your group is dealing with internal issues . Smile . Celebrate success . Provide refreshments at meetings and encourage mingling . Relax once in a while and just enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do Fundraising Second <p> There is so much more to a parent group than fundraising . And yet fundraising often gets the most attention . <p> " Orders are due by Tuesday ! " <p> " Prizes will be given for the top-selling classroom . " <p> " Welcome back to school ... and here 's the fundraising packet . " <p> " Sell , sell , sell ! " <p> Posters , glossy brochures , kickoff assemblies , monthly promotions , classroom competitions , and incentive programs all put the focus on fundraising and drown out the more important message of your group 's good work . <p> Often , the very first contact a parent has with a group is the arrival of the fall fundraising packet . Of course , you want to get your major fundraising done quickly so you have the funds to carry through the year . But when the first parent group event is outright fundraising , you run the risk of appearing to be only about money . <p> Consider setting aside enough funds at the end of the school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following fall . Demonstrate first that you are sincere about school improvement and parent involvement , and then the inevitable fundraising appeal wo n't seem so desperate . <h> 9 . Roll Out the Welcome Wagon <p> Welcome people one-on-one at every opportunity . Go out of your way to introduce yourself . Do n't assume everyone knows who you are or what your group is all about . You and the other officers are your group 's best ambassadors . <p> Take a few minutes to learn a fact or two about each newcomer . Learn names . Use them . Ask about their children . Find out about their skills , interests , and parent group experience . Listen thoughtfully to new ideas . Delegate the good jobs , not just the busy work . Empower your committees . Use name tags at meetings so when somebody new does come , she wo n't feel like an outsider . <h> 10 . Be Open to Ideas <p> If you want newcomers to become a true part of your team , it 's important to let them contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never say " We tried that ; it did n't work " or " That 's not the way we do it . " Yes , you 're the one with experience , but outsiders will view responses like this as closed-minded . People like to feel that their opinions count . <p> When you are confronted with the words " At my child 's old school , the PTO ... , " drop your defenses and really listen . Write down suggestions . Brainstorm new ideas with other parents , not just your fellow officers . Survey the parent community . You could be pleasantly surprised at what your parents have to say . And if the results are less than complimentary , use the information to get the group back on track . <h> 11 . Get Organized <p> Sometimes parent groups get a bad rap from outsiders as being cliquish , gossipy , or even irrelevant . Your challenge is to demonstrate to the rest of the school community that your group is a legitimate , well-run organization . You want to show others that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Get organized . Write bylaws and follow them . Use basic parliamentary procedure at your meetings . Provide training for your committee chairpeople . Pass along files from year to year . Keep good financial records and report openly . <p> On a more personal level , avoid pettiness and cliquish behavior . Do n't take criticism personally . Avoid inside jokes that leave outsiders puzzled . People will find other ways to use their time if your group projects an unfriendly attitude . On the other hand , if you promise a positive experience , sound training , and good role models , your group will attract the best your community has to offer . <h> 12 . Say Thank-You <p> It seems so obvious to say thanks to people who volunteer their time and talent . But often by the time the carnival has been torn down , the donor thank-you letters have been sent , or the cookie dough has been distributed , you just want to put that project behind you . There 's a tendency to assume that successful completion should be satisfaction enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't do this to get thanked . " True , some volunteers do n't need special recognition to feel good about their involvement . But do it anyway . Thanking volunteers assures everyone that their time is valued and their contribution is appreciated . <p> Keep good records of participation so you do n't forget who to thank . Thank people in a timely manner and in a personal way . Never settle for " Thanks to everyone for all your help . " Send emails or notes or stop people at school and offer your thanks in person . Make sending proper thank-yous to all volunteers part of the job description for all officers and committee chairpeople . And it 's OK , maybe even essential , to organize a formal volunteer appreciation event . Get past the objections that the parent group should n't use its resources to " thank ourselves . " Celebrating the work of your volunteers builds pride , which leads to a stronger and more effective organization in the long run . <h> 13 . Enlist the Principal <p> The most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a strong advocate to help the parent group build involvement . The parent group , in turn , becomes a powerful engine to help propel the school toward its educational goals . To create this kind of success , you have to have a trusting relationship with the principal . That does n't mean you have to agree on everything , but it means you have to find common ground . And it means you have to respect each others ' roles . <p> Talk with the principal about goals , objectives , and roles . Enlist her aid to promote parent group activities to the students and staff members . Encourage her to speak about the tangible benefits of parent involvement . Consider making her part of your executive board , and invite her to your general meetings . Work as a team . Seeing the principal as an active partner in the PTO shows parents that the school values your organization .

The school parking lot was overflowing with cars , and we wondered what was going on inside . " Maybe it 's a parent group meeting , " she said , and I could n't suppress a smile . Little did she know that any of the chairpeople of our town Parent Advisory Council would kill to have parent involvement like that . <p> Creating sustained involvement is one of the biggest challenges any parent group faces . Even parents who are interested in parent group participation at the beginning of the year can slowly drop off the map . The key is to make sure you nurture your volunteers by making sure they have a positive experience each time they participate . <p> Here are some ideas we have implemented at Fisher Elementary in Walpole , Mass. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know You <p> Do n't assume that parents know what your parent group is all about . You have to tell them . <p> At the beginning of the school year , our cochairs make folders for distribution at open house and at the first parent group meeting . The folders have information about the PAC and the programs it offers . At open house , we place the PAC table right by the door so parents can stop by either on the way in or out . We also look for a way to get people to linger ; fresh-baked cookies work well . <p> We especially focus on volunteer surveys , making sure to include one in every folder . It also helps to hand the survey to each parent individually . Ask people to fill out the survey on the spot ; you 'll get much better response that way . <p> If possible , follow up the surveys with a personal phone call . Thank parents for their time , and remind them what they signed up for . This also gives you a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't listed on the survey . <h> Say the Magic Words <p> My daughter 's third-grade teacher sent out a request asking for volunteers for an in-class writing camp . She specified that parents themselves need not be great writers . More important , she knew how to toss the bait : Helping at the writing camp , she wrote , will give you an idea of what to expect come MCAS time . The next morning , she had eight volunteers . MCAS is the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System , a standardized test every third-grader faces for the first time . Parents , many of whom were probably more anxious about the test than their children were , signed up to find out what all the fuss was about . <h> It 's All About Access <p> There 's got to be some advantage to showing up at every bake sale and school volunteer event , and there is . For one , you get to be on a first-name basis with the principal and the teachers . That does matter and grants you audience with school authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your time . <p> Our phone-in coordinator , who handles all the absentee phone calls for the school , gets to chat with the principal every morning . She lists this as one of the perks of the job and often mentions it when she asks for volunteers . <h> Be Sure To Ask <p> We had an ace cochair at Fisher who was particularly adept at remembering what people 's skills were . One frantic winter evening , we desperately needed a willing volunteer to churn out a well-designed flyer overnight . Carol worked the phones , made the call to a friend of a friend , and found a parent who did the job willingly and who was delighted that she had been asked . <p> Most people who do n't volunteer say they do n't because they were never asked . Be sure to ask . The most effective way is one to one , whether in person or on the phone . You 're more likely to get a yes if you ask someone to handle a specific task rather than to join our group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do better if , like Carol , you can match people 's talents with the job they fill . <h> PTO Spells " Mom Support Group " <p> Miss the cooler talk at work ? What better way to continue the trend than to hang with friends together at a school event ? Imagine getting to be with friends , make a couple of new ones , catch up on the latest neighborhood gossip , maybe learn new parenting techniques and , best of all , find out more about what 's going on at your kids school . The fact is that a parent group is also a social outlet for many moms , and there is no better way to make that point than to invite a friend as a volunteer to have her check out the action for herself . <p> People are more likely to participate in a group when they know someone who 's already involved , so do n't be shy about extending that invitation . <h> It Takes a Village <p> Fisher School hosts a spring carnival every year , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five neighborhood kids and their moms . One afternoon we roll 1,000 ticket bundles for the school . I follow this with an ice cream sundae party as a small incentive for the little ones . Having children count and bundle elastics around tickets might not seem like much , but to them it is real work , and they and their moms are always delighted to help . <p> When it is time to actually swing the carnival into action , it feels like the whole town shows up to help . Our family helps set up the ticket booths , and every able body drags tables , puts up posters , tears duct tape " it is a great example of community work in action . It feels like a setting right out of a Master Card commercial : Massage for stiff back , $65 . Pizza for dinner , $20 . The look in our daughters ' eyes when we rush around setting up the tables , knowing that we care about their school , priceless ! <p> Parent volunteers send the message to their children that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time you come in for reading hour , you build your child 's self-esteem . Besides , you 're taking advantage of all the years when they actually do want you in there . Later on , when the eye rolls begin and you become an embarrassment , you can choose to work from the sidelines . It is important to take this message to potential parent volunteers by stating it loudly and often . <h> If You 're Happy and You Show It ... <p> The sense of community that volunteering can bring is the most powerful feeling of all , and it helps if the uninitiated also get to watch you in action . Fisher carnival and art program planning meetings are highly anticipated events . We host the meetings at volunteers homes , and the conversation , food , and drinks flow freely .

Then she assigns one coordinator for each grade . <p> Each coordinator gets a list of items needed from her grade . The coordinator calls the room mothers and gives them the list . The list finally trickles down to individual parents , who sign up to bring items when asked by room moms . It works without a hitch , and everyone helps . Having room moms make the final requests also lends a personal touch to the asking . <h> Attention to Detail <p> Sometimes the way to a volunteer 's heart is through her stomach . Community grocery stores are often very gracious and donate small deli platters for parents who come in to volunteer straight from work . Similarly , we formed babysitting co-ops where one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer . Then when your turn rolls around , you know where to look for help with the kids . If your group can provide babysitting services , all the better . <h> Learning the Ways <p> If you have a fifth-grade graduation ceremony at the school and your child is graduating , would n't it be nice to actually relax and enjoy the ceremony ? We ask fourth-grade parents to attend to the fifth-grade parents that morning . In return for their services , the fourth-grade moms get to watch what 's involved in the ceremony and get to take notes for when their own babies graduate from elementary school . <p> Similarly , we ask second-grade parents to volunteer at third-grade science night . When it comes time to return the favor , third-grade parents volunteer at second-grade math night . <p> All of us have seen one volunteer who just does not want to step down . Having a mentoring system , where rookie volunteers learn from more experienced ones , makes transition easier and makes the older volunteers feel better about letting go . <h> Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program called Fisher Smarts . Students usually earn these for good skills , both academic and social . Every student contributes his Smarts to a class kitty . At the end of the year , the class with the most Smarts wins a pizza party . <p> We extended the Fisher Smarts program to parents . Every parent who attends a parent group meeting gets to bring home a Smart for his child . The child is recognized the next morning at school and can add to his classroom 's Smarts collection . Parents would never leave the meeting without the incentive , and the Smarts serve as an added draw to attend all meetings . <p> The neat thing about a parent bringing back a Smart is that it directly boosts the child 's self-esteem , making the child proud that his parent participated in the school process . <p> If we did not allow parents to volunteer if they brought their children-1 of my VP 's , my Secretary and several other parent volunteers would not have been a part of our PTO board this year ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys and cartoons for the children to enjoy while the parents worked as well as having snacks on hand for them . Shame on your administration ! ! ! We would have had to eliminate our PTO if our school had dictated such a ruling ! <p> Here 's another idea for involving parent volunteers with young children when children are not welcomed to " tag along with mom . " Whenever my ladies group at church has a big function , we always offer a " nursery " for mom 's who need babysitting for children ages 1-12 . We organize games , songs and other activities to keep the kids busy and the assignments rotate . We require moms to sign up for this in advance , so we know how many kids to expect and their ages . The nursery is usually on site , which makes parents feel more comfortable . Maybe there is a corner of the library where you could keep young children entertained ( stories , puppet shows , videos etc. ) for an hour or so . Check to see if an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be sure you have adequate adult supervision per child and ages . Also , be sure to have a sign in sheet that contains parent contact information , and the name and age of child . <p> I 've never experienced this problem , but the first solution that comes to my mind is for you to form a babysitting co-op or play group . Form a list of mom 's in your neighborhood who would be willing to exchange babysitting services for some time volunteering in the schools . This could be a good way for neighbors to get to know one another . You could facilitate parents meeting one another by having a meet and greet . Invite all interested participants to come and learn more about volunteering and the co-op . <p> We are at a brand new school and the administrative team has decided to enforce a " no younger siblings " rule . As parent volunteers , we are not allowed to bring younger children to school with us when we volunteer ... it is being advertised as a distraction to the learning environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others against the school leadership . The parents who are home during the day and available to volunteer are the ones staying home with younger children . They are also the families on single incomes where money is tight . I am looking for positive ways to come to a mutually beneficial compromise to this decision . I welcome advice from anyone else who has been through this and has feedback to make the journey toward compromise easier for us ...

But a second look reveals something truly special about the school 's new playground . The ramps connecting each platform , the tabletop play areas , and the lack of woodchips on the ground are just some of the unique features that make this playground accessible to kids of all abilities . And if you visit during recess you 'll see children with wheelchairs , walkers , and other support equipment playing alongside their peers . <p> Handicapped-accessible playgrounds like Valencia 's are n't cheap " on average they can cost $100,000 to $200,000 " and paying for the project required its backer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original budget for the playground . They tackled the higher price tag with a creative combination of strategies including running standard fundraisers , mining parent connections , and engaging in an extensive grantwriting campaign . This three-pronged approach helped the HSC fund the more than $130,000 project without exhausting the resources of school families and helped make recess meaningful for each of the school 's 550 students . <p> The group 's original playground plans were simple : with a budget of $26,000 , the HSC intended to remove the old playground , and purchase and install traditional equipment . But as Kim De Serpa , the group 's site council chairwoman , and fellow parent Deardra Cline discussed the plans , the idea for a bigger , more inclusive playground began to take shape . <p> Valencia houses the district 's elementary special needs program , which serves about 20 students in two classrooms . Cline 's daughter Madelyn , a Valencia student , has Rett syndrome , a neurological disorder limiting movement and often requiring the use of a wheelchair . Cline suggested forgoing traditional play structures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole school could enjoy together . With ramps , wheel- and walker-friendly rubberized groundcover , and other accessibility modifications , the playground would cost more , but , explains De Serpa , the community quickly embraced the idea of enabling all its students to play . " People at our school " including teachers , staff , and students " wanted something more than a regular playground ; we wanted all of our kids to get up on this thing . " <p> Once the HSC committed to building an accessible playground , it needed to tackle funding the project . Covering the $100,000 price jump required the group to look beyond its usual revenue sources . <p> With profits from the group 's regular fundraisers ( eScrip enrollment , the annual wrapping paper drive , tickets to the city 's fireworks show , and the raffle of a Toyota Prius donated by a car dealership ) along with revenue from a dinner and auction event dedicated to funding the project , the HSC was able to donate $62,000 for the playground . The auction alone earned $40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of standard auction items and personal experiences , such as a surfing tutorial from a Valencia teacher , with the event 's success . Having both a live and silent auction also worked well , giving everyone a chance to participate . <p> Relying on parent expertise helped cut project costs . One family within the construction industry helped the group get concrete at a considerably reduced cost . Similarly , a parent with construction project management experience provided advice throughout the process , helping the HSC avoid pricey pitfalls and ensuring quality . <p> Even with the proceeds from the auction and other fundraisers and the help of parents with industry connections , the HSC still needed to raise more than $70,000 for the playground . To cover the gap , De Serpa undertook an ambitious grantwriting campaign . A social worker with experience writing grants , she applied for 26 on behalf of the HSC . After a year-long effort , the group was awarded $97,500 in funding through a combination of 15 local , regional , national , and even international grants . Businesses and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are impressive , De Serpa says they 're not impossible to duplicate , no matter what your group 's project . With persistence , flexibility , and creativity , the HSC was able to attract a varied group of financial supporters . Many of the grants came from organizations supporting children with disabilities ( $5,000 from the Safeway Foundation and $10,000 from the Dana and Christopher Reeve Foundation ) or local recreation ( $10,000 from Santa Cruz County Parks and Recreation ) , but many came from less likely companies ( $1,000 from CVS Pharmacy ) . Looking for funding opportunities beyond obvious sources significantly deepened the pool for Valencia . <p> The HSC also got essential assistance from the National Center for Boundless Playgrounds . The organization certifies and facilitates installation of playgrounds like Valencia 's and even connects groups with interested donors and helps them navigate the grant application process . With their help , the parent group secured a $10,000 grant from Curam Software International . Partnering with a national organization can provide groups with technical support and help raise the profile of grant applications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grants , says De Serpa , was taking the time to research available funding and then carefully tailoring each application to meet specific requirements . She watched the local newspaper for stories about grants being awarded and then used those as leads for potential playground funders . <p> Finally , De Serpa encourages parent groups hoping to fund projects in tough economic times to think big . Choosing a goal beyond the ordinary , " one that tugs on funders ' heartstrings " is vital to attracting donors . Tell potential donors exactly how their gift will impact the project and focus on creating personal relationships with funders . " The importance of making a connection with the decision makers in those organizations can not be underestimated , " she says . <p> Whether it 's spent reaching the top of the climbing structure or discovering a ground level play area tucked underneath a tower , recess is different now for everyone at Valencia . Recess has gone from exclusive to inclusive , something that principal Dianna Higginbotham is especially excited about . " It 's heartwarming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing barriers that previously existed , " says Higginbotham . " It brings a smile to my face . " <h> Grantwriting : Getting Started <p> " Grantwriting is not hard , " says Kim De Serpa . " It just takes time ... researching available grants , determining eligibility , and figuring out who to contact . " Follow these steps to start applying for and receiving grants for your next big project . <p> Apply for 501(c) ( 3 ) status . Consider making- your group a legally recognized nonprofit . While there is some initial expense to becoming a 501(c) ( 3 ) organization , it allows access to grant moneys reserved for nonprofits . <p> Make it official . Designate a grantwriting position on your board . " It 's a great job for a working parent who wants to contribute to their school 's organization because much of the research can be accomplished in the evenings after the kids are in bed , " De Serpa says . <p> Find funding . Look everywhere for leads on potential funders . Start online with grant websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example ) . Also look for foundations funding similar projects nationwide . Consider everyone as a potential resource : community foundations , local philanthropists , school administrators , and elected officials might all connect you to potential grants . <p> Write it right .

Meet discouragement with an inner attitude of , " Oh yeah ? Watch me ! " This will energize you in the face of inevitable setbacks . <p> Be patient and persistent .

But we must also include the name and address of the person designated as our " agent " in the Articles , and we need to file an update if it changes . <p> I just ca n't see loading our main document ( i.e. constitution ) with info that changes yearly and thus requires an amendment at a general meeting . The constitution is supposed to be stuff highly unlikely to change . <p> One person at the Secretary of State 's Office told me some orgs like ours file an Article of Association with them for the purpose of incorporating , but still maintain a Constitution and Bylaws under which they operate . ( But then again , they are n't supposed to answer questions about the Articles as it might be construed as legal advice . ) <p> Does anyone have insight into this ? Can you have both ( Articles of Incorporation AND Constitution ) ? Does one need to reference the other ? Those of you who have incorporated - did you replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form to be filed ? <p> Just something you might want to check on : when I called the non-profit help line to ask a question about our 501-c-3 application she asked if we were incorporating . I said no and she told me that we should make sure that we do n't intend to in the future because it would require us to reapply for our non-profit status and pay another $500 . We decided we would probably never feel the need to do that and proceeded with our constitution and by-laws . Just curious--why are you incorporating ? <p> We incorporated ( and just received our certificate ) and we made sure that our articles of incorporation ( which was a form provided by the state ) and our bylaws related ( did n't contradict one another ) . We incorporated to protect the officers against any liability . It was very easy to do and was n't that expensive . We do n't have ( and never did have ) a Constitution . We also made sure that our articles of incorporation and bylaws did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 501(c) ( 3 ) which I 'm in the midst of filling out the form . By the way ... the NPN information sent out a few months back really helped .

We know we have to submit articles of association , which to my knowledge are different than our bylaws . Do you know if there is a form we can just follow ? Is it really like 30 pages long that we were told ? We are in California . I am the president of our group , and our vp is supposed to be following through with this , but I ca n't seem to get any status updates on it . So I 'm trying to research myself . But legal jargon does not process through this brain of mine . I 'm just looking for some help . I really thought there would be a specific topic on this site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so important in the process of obtaining NPO . <p> If you buy the PTOToday StartUp Toolkit , it is very helpful . However , to answer your question about the Articles of Incorporation ( AoI ) --no , it 's not 30 pages . It 's two , almost everywhere . But the rules for the AoI are governed by each state--maybe by the Secretary of State , or the state corporations office , etc. , and the language tends to be very specific by state . For California , go here and the document you find seems to lay everything out pretty well .

@@35479230 @4479230/ <h> Get Teachers on Your Side <p> Love ' em or hate ' em , teachers play a key role in the success of any parent group . When teachers are on your side , they can improve PTO programs , make fundraising more successful , help build support among parents and administrators , and more . When you 're not working successfully with teachers , almost everything becomes harder . <p> If you are starting the school year feeling isolated and unconnected with the teachers at your school , ask yourself this question : Do you know what teachers really care about ? Here are four keys to working well with teachers . They involve understanding what 's important to teachers and incorporating that understanding into your group 's plans . <h> 1 . Curriculum Enrichment <p> Teachers love programs that tie into their curricula , and they like to have input into what types of programs are run . The beginning of the year is the most convenient time for teachers to work with parent groups on planning curriculum enrichment because teachers come to school two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to plan events , activities , field trips , and lessons that correlate with state benchmarks . <p> Schedule a slot during one of these meeting days to talk to the teachers about their curriculum needs for the year . Hand out surveys to learn which activities have been successful in the past , which curriculum areas need the most enrichment , which teachers are able to volunteer and in what capacity . Schedule time during the day to meet with teachers from each grade level to discuss their needs and ideas on a more individual basis . <p> Together , parents and teachers at East Haddam Elementary School in Moodus , Conn. , select cultural events appropriate to grade level and course of study . One successful assembly features a Chinese dance group performing for second-graders to coincide with their unit on Asia . " One of our most successful ways of involving teachers is through our Cultural Arts Program , " says Amy Widmark , PTO president . " Instead of our PTO choosing and hosting cultural arts events independently , we spend a lot of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events would help enrich the current curriculum . " <p> The PTO sends out written surveys to each grade level team asking the following questions : <p> What are your major areas of study ? <p> Which areas do you think would be best enhanced by a cultural arts event ? <p> What types of events in the past have been , in your opinion , successful/unsuccessful " and which should not be repeated ? <p> Are you aware of any specific cultural arts performers or events that you would like the PTO to pursue ? <p> Include questions like these in your own back-to-school surveys to let teachers know that you are on their side in planning curriculum enrichment . <p> Lucy Putlak , president of the Oak Terrace Elementary School PTO in Highwood , Ill. , says , " We have more teacher involvement than most schools . In fact we had a Cinco de Mayo celebration that was essentially a fun fair , and a teacher was the chairperson . " Students played games , ate Mexican cuisine , and enjoyed Mexican music and dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers on its side in planning events such as the Cinco de Mayo festival . PTO leaders make sure that parent and teacher volunteers are mentioned in the local newspaper as well as in a prominent piece in the school newsletter . Teachers who chair committees receive the most volunteers in their classrooms , more involved room parents , and special gifts at the annual teacher luncheon . Perks like these can be mentioned in the initial back-to-school PTO meeting to encourage teacher participation in coordinating curriculum-related events . <p> Teachers agree that everyone needs to be involved in the learning process . Joan Krsak , fourth-grade teacher at Fairmoor Elementary School in Columbus , Ohio , says , " I think PTOs should be involved in curriculum because student achievement and learning should be everyone 's primary focus . PTOs could be incredibly helpful by organizing enrichment career days , guest speakers , parent and teacher nights around specific curriculum focuses , and special assemblies . " <p> Krsak recommends that parent groups appoint at least one or two teacher liaisons to help bounce ideas back and forth when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . PTO members also might sit in on a few grade-level meetings to discuss events and to present informal outlines to teachers and administrators as the curriculum enrichment planning progresses . <h> 2 . Opening Supply Lines <p> Teachers often spend the beginning of the school year attending workshops , seminars , and continuing education classes . They learn new teaching techniques that can help students achieve higher test scores , think like scientists , and become better writers . The newer teaching techniques are often creative and fun . However , they require a diverse array of supplies . Some teachers start the year spending more than $1,000 of their own money to buy the supplies that the school does not provide . <p> Ask PTO members to dig through their garage or basement for these materials . Fill gift bags with the donated items and present them to the teachers , perhaps at the back-to-school meeting . You 'll be amazed at the joy a few simple items from your home can bring to a teacher . <p> Do n't forget to make up bags for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fairmoor Elementary , says , " Blocks , sand , penny collections , and anything else that could be used for hands-on learning works best for my students . I use a lot of manipulatives to teach counting and measuring skills . " <p> The Oak Terrace PTO has an Angel Fund , which is a teacher wish list for items the budget does not provide . " Our Angel Fund chair does a lot to get teachers involved , says Lucy Putlak , PTO president . " We ask that teachers come to the meetings with their wish lists , and we give each grade an opportunity to speak and announce their needs . Items needed are posted in each classroom , and we are always updating the lists . " <p> The principal at Oak Terrace Elementary School has recently started to review teachers ' Angel Fund requests , marking items as necessaries or extras . The teachers receive a monetary budget for new items , but there is no limit to requests on used items . Requests for used items are published by grade in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been positive . One teacher even received a small refrigerator for her classroom last year . <p> The Oak Terrace PTO organizes the back-to-school supply list by teacher and grade level and publishes it in English and Spanish . <p> Krsak , fourth grade teacher at Fairmoor Elementary , suggests making supply lists available all year and posting them in stores such as Staples and Office Depot . Many schools have each teacher type up a list of supplies that the students will need to start the school year . The lists are handed in to a manager or customer service representative , who then hangs the lists in a prominent place . <h> 3 . Talk , Talk , Talk <p> Many teachers pursue master 's degrees and juggle part-time jobs in addition to managing a full-time teaching career , or they divide time between their full-time teaching careers and their families . Understandably , it has become increasingly difficult to attract teachers to events outside of regular school hours . <p> For this reason , many successful parent groups do n't worry about attracting teachers to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on PTO projects . The main goal is to get the support and aid of the teachers on a regular basis , not to see their faces at a meeting once a month . <p> To do this , it 's important to open the lines of communication with teachers . You have many tools to get your message across : paper newsletters , email , web page , flyers , phone calls . They all have advantages and disadvantages . Newsletters may gravitate , unread , to the bottom of the in box . Emails may not get opened . Flyers may get lost or thrown away . The webpage provides a ready reference that 's always available , but it 's passive " teachers have to make the effort to go there . The first rule of good communication is to use as many of these tools as you can . The more ways in which you deliver your message , the more likely it is to be heard . <p> Frances Jenkins , PTO president at Collins Lane Elementary School in Frankfort , Ky. , makes sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has the principal forward the letter to all of the staff . The newsletter is posted on the Collins Lane website . The group also makes an effort to connect one-on-one with the teachers instead of directing all communication through the principal . " I feel that this is a great benefit for teacher involvement keeping our teachers informed has worked for us , " Jenkins says . <p> Loud speaker messages and short memos placed in teachers ' mailboxes are great ways to convey information to busy teachers , says Lisa Meyers , eighth grade teacher at White Plains Middle School , White Plains , N.Y . While not all teachers will find the time to read a newsletter , short memos grab everyone 's attention , and they can be read much faster . Messages over the loud speaker at the beginning of the school day , before the kids are in the classrooms , are great because teachers can multi-task by listening while setting up chairs or writing on the blackboard , Meyers says . <p> Jessica Witten , special education teacher at Fairmoor Elementary School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief memos in my mailbox about upcoming events with plenty of advance notice , so I can rearrange my schedule accordingly . " <h> 4 . A Little Appreciation <p> Every year in May , parent groups all across the country celebrate their schools ' teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week . That 's a nice event , but if you really want to cultivate a strong relationship with teachers , show them all year long that they 're appreciated . <p> " It definitely helps a teacher strive for excellence when their hard work does not go unnoticed . Thank you cards , letters , and phone calls are the best forms of thanks , " says Michael Meyers , fourth grade teacher at Public School 178 in the Bronx , N.Y . <p> " It is important to feel appreciated . It 's important for every human to feel valued , not just teachers , " agrees Krsak of Fairmoor Elementary School . " Ways to show appreciation include verbal encouragement , active participation , monthly recognition of quality classes or teachers , support for teacher decisions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Use all of these methods to show teachers that you know what an important role they play in creating a strong school and a good education for your community 's children . " We try to make our teachers understand how much we appreciate the hard and underpaid work they do . We are in this together with them , and want what 's best for our kids , " says Jenkins . <p> Schools work best when parents , teachers , and administrators work in partnership . When each of these groups complement and support each other , school performance improves and so does student achievement . So reach out to your school 's teachers . The benefits can be tremendous . <p> Have you had a chance to check out our message boards ? **27;892;TOOLONG folks on the boards are parent group leaders with a lot of experience to share , and others might have the same questions you do ... so please jump in.Best of luck , Lisa <p> Our PTO is for the Middle School .

We normally can only raise about $3000.00 a year and by time we pay for printing costs , help to fund scholarships for field trips etc there is little left . How does your Middle School PTO run ? Lisa <p> We have a program called gracious gifts in our PTO where teachers may ask on a monthly basis for items needed in the classroom that may be donated .

I like the idea of a used item inventory as well , that maybe the teachign staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my school I do n't find the teachers very welcoming to the PTO . They are thankful for the grants and programs we bring in , but I also think that they see us as a bother since they have to reschedule certain days for the programs we bring in . It 's frustrating to say the least . We bring in so much money for them but we get little to no participation or help with our events . <p> We have a wish list program where the teachers submit a list at the end of the year for items needed for the next school year ( they can add any additional items before Open House ) . We make stars with the item listed on the front and the teachers name on the back and have them posted outside the teachers door . There are fliers at Open House explaining that anyone can choose a star and purchase the item and then send it back through school for the teacher . The list is also available through the school website . The response is good although teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their classroom how often it is used . We make sure to include support staff like the nurse , librarian , and reading teachers . Good Luck ! <p> I know that sending flyers to teachers is advocated here , but my experience tells me that they are usually not read . I get a better response with a combination of flyer and email . I get the teacher 's email addresses from the school district 's website . <p> This way you reach the younger teachers with their medium of choice and the older teachers with theirs .

@@35479233 @4479233/ <h> Group Insurance : Frequently Asked Questions <h> Getting Started/General <p> In many states , school districts are not allowed to cover parent groups because they are independent from the school and not government entities . There are some school districts out there , however , who might still cover the parent teacher group under their policy . The best advice is to give your school a very specific list of your activities and request a written letter from the school stating that all of your activities are covered . Some policies only cover the parent teacher group for events during school hours and on the school campus so that needs to be clearly spelled out as well . Quite often the school assumes you are covered without actually looking into the specifics .

For most states the liquor liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in : New Jersey , Florida , Louisiana , West Virginia or Kentucky , please contact us . The rates below assume the type of event where liquor liability is requested falls within the approved scope of events noted as " included " in the current list for the PTO program , so always refer to that List of Covered Events . Please note that events that you feel might possibly be out of scope from the " included " type of events will need to be referred to Bene-Marc for consideration <p> 1-100 attendees : $60.00 <p> 101-200 attendees : $85.00 <p> 201-300 attendees : $160.00 <p> 301-800 attendees : $260.00 <p> Above 800 attendees : Referral to underwriter <h> Policy Questions <p> The combination of general liability and excess accident medical coverage is important for groups to ensure the groups satisfy the insurance requirements of school districts and venues where PTO-sponsored events are held . General liability insurance provides coverage in the event of a third party bodily injury ( non-participant injury ) or property damage claim . In addition , the excess accident medical coverage provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers all the officers of your group in the circumstance they are sued personally for a decision made by the group . The D&amp;O policy has a $1,000,000 limit per claim , $1,000,000 aggregate limit per parent organization , and a $10,000,000 annual aggregate limit for the Purchasing Group . <p> General Liability protects your group from 3rd party bodily injury and property damage claims arising out of your sponsored events . The coverage " trigger " occurs when there is property damage or bodily injury at a covered event . For example , if a third party is injured while participating in a PTO sponsored event , a claim could arise that should be filed under the General Liability policy . A General Liability claim could also arise from actions of a PTO member who damages school property . <p> If PTO officers hire a company to provide bounce houses for a back to school kickoff , but fail to verify insurance or undertake any due diligence regarding the vendor , and an incident occurs involving the vendor , the Officers could be sued personally for their decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bodily injury or property damage to trigger a D&amp;O claim . In fact , if the claim alleges either bodily injury or property damage , the claim should be filed under the General Liability . <p> Property coverage extends to any personal property of the parent teacher group , such as computers , popcorn machines , and fundraising merchandise . If you " gift " an item to the school , however , that item would be considered school property and covered under the school 's insurance policy . Excess Accident Medical and General Liability must be purchased with Property insurance . <p> Please note that the insurance options effective 7/1/10 have changed . If a PTO group is seeking crime coverage effective 7/1/10 or later this coverage will be automatically paired with General Liability and Excess Accident Medical coverage . <p> The best thing you can do to protect your group 's money is to put in place sound financial controls . Insisting that someone who does not sign checks reviews the bank statement will help to protect your organization from having a loss , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person who does n't have check signing authority basically needs to date and sign the monthly bank statement indicating it has been reviewed . The audit does not need to be done by an accountant , just an independent person who understands the process . PTO Today 's Treasurer 's Toolkit has several other helpful financial controls to help you safeguard your money . <p> Yes , the treasurer can reconcile the bank statement . It 's important , however , to have someone else review the reconciliation to make sure it was done properly . In addition , you must conduct an annual audit of the books by an audit committee or a qualified accountant and the monthly bank statement must be opened/reviewed by someone who does not have authorization to sign checks . <p> You might want to consider Finance Manager ( **33;1018;TOOLONG ) to make bank reconciliation easy . Since Finance Manager is a web based software program , your financial data is accessible to anyone with the right permission level . This makes reviewing the bank reconciliation a very simple process ! <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they accept the gift , then the school also accepts responsibility for those items and it further separates your group from liability . This is quite often done with playground equipment and similar types of items . Please remember that " gifting or trusting " items to a school will provide some defense in court but can not stop someone from filing a lawsuit . <p> Policy cancellation is allowed , but the premium is flat and fully earned at time of payment therefore there is no refund available. - If , for record keeping purposes , you would like to formally cancel the policy , you must do so in writing. - Send email request to Brandi Terry at This email address is being protected from spambots .

One thing I came up with was a father ( or male ) /child fishing trip . We have a state park nearby with a small catch and release pond specifically for kids . Do a BBQ , and some outdoor games ( treasure hunt , sack or three-legged races , etc ) . We have also thought about doing a combo father/daughter dinner &amp; father/son sports thing ... for the dads who may only have children of one gender or for those who have both/all children for a limited amount of time ( visitations ) &amp; do n't want to split it between their kids . <p> My D.H. , also very involved in our PTA , says things need to be geared not as much toward women .

I reserved our local YMCA for an evening . Because we are a non profit organization it only cost us $90 which included two lifeguards . The big and little guys were able to play raquetball , basketball , swim and more . The added bonus for me , was there was no prep or clean up afterwards . The only thing they required was proof of insurance and a letter stating how many participants afterwards . Since this event cost so little , with the extra money I had in my budget , each boy was given a school logo water bottle afterwards at no charge .

@@35479241 @4479241/ <h> Co-President and Co vice president descriptions <p> I am new to the executive board of our PTA . Last year our board , who all resigned , decided that we needed more help on the executive level and added the positions of Co-president and Co vice president . I have been informed that as a result of these added positions we as the new board will need to update our bylaws to identify the difference in the roles and responsibilities of each position--I believe the intent of the change was to help keep from overloading the president and vicepresident but right now I am having difficulty finding some documented basis for division of responsibilities to pass on to our new board . It seems to me that a co president might actually take on the responsibilities of what are traditionally considered the vice presidents role . Our state office indicated that they do not support the " CO " officer structure and could not help us out but with how to divy the responsibilities .

Edit : please feel free to post descriptions right here on the forums . <h> Reply to bjoyce1824 <p> yikes ! And I was thinking have one of each was to many ! Only kidding , hey I would leave it the way it was . Just give more resp. to the committee chairs . You as pres can set up and demolish any committee at anytime . If you decide this is the best choice , then yes , you have to change the bylaws . I would really think about added CO anybody ! I had two treasures to go forward this year and after learning what the role was I was going to ask one to step down . Well after a couple days of fighting , one quit along with the vp . Not a pretty sight . But , to many indians and no chiefs is not good . <p> Many ( actually , probably most ) of the parent groups in this area have more than one VP . I 've typically seen them " numbered , " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 1st VP is responsible for programs , and the 2nd VP is responsible for fundraising . That seems to be the most typical division around here . You might want to call the state PTA office back and ask them if they can give you examples of the bylaws sections that deal with officer descriptions , specifically ones that have more than just one VP . It may be that no one calls them a " Co-VP " and that 's why they told you they could n't help you with that . I just ca n't believe that there 's any state where all the units just have one VP ; I think you got a bad answer there . <p> As for Co-Presidents .... Not only will they not support you in writing a description for that , your state is also unlikely to approve your bylaws if you submit such a change . As to what the ramifications of that are ... ? Depends on your state ... they might just turn a blind eye . Or , you would probably be listed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshest penalty for that is that they would n't let you participate in Reflections . Technically , I guess they could also yank your tax exemption . But that would be shooting themselves in the foot . <p> Personally , I 'm not a fan of the co-president idea .

The PTO provides the food , drinks and also the music ; which is usually played through a borrowed stero . We hold this event in the cafeteria . The PTO allows a $400 budget , this pays for decorations , invitations , food &amp; drinks .

We used a background that we had at the school or made our own ( a simple stool for dad to sit on , with a column and a potted plant beside it and soem blue butcher paper ) .... We charged $3 for one picture and $5 for two , then extras could be purchased for $1 . <p> Being a school where 85%+ were economicaly disadvantaged this was a GREAT event for our PTO ! Just do n't forget that not everyone has " DAD " around , so make sure you get the message out that it can be STEPdad , GRANDdad , Uncle , or even Family Friend ..... <p> ***JUST TO NOTE*** We also started a Mother/Son Sports Night so the boys did n't feel left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games like Soccer kick , tug of war , football throw , etc. and we also had a couple of bounce houses .

The boys held a football and posed and mom had a pair of pom-poms ( on loan from a cheerleader ) . We charged the same amount as we did for the Daddy Daughter Dance and both events were help from 7:00pm to 9:00pm on a Friday night .

@@35479248 @4479248/ <h> charging taxes at Scholstic Book Fair <p> We run a Scholastic book fair twice a year . We have a new rep for our school , which is in Massachusetts . We just ended our book fair and she is telling us we have to charge our parents tax on their purchases . The Treasurer is arguing that we are a non-profit organization and we can not charge taxes on a fundraiser . The rep for Scholastic is saying because we take our profit in free books , instead of cash , it is not considered a fundraiser . ( We give the books to our classromm teacher+GGs and reading specialist . ) The reason we take the profit in free books is , we get 50% of our sales in free books . If we took the cash we only recieve 25% of our sales in cash . So we get more profit for our Teaacher 's to recieve books . ( A no brainer right ! After all , we are there to raise money and do what ever we can to enrich the school ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their book fair ? Any one with incite on this would be a great help . <p> I am in Massachusetts , and we DO NOT charge taxes , as specified by the Scholastic contract . The difference is that we take the cash . As I understand it , but I would need to verify , we receive 30% or 35% ( somewhere in that area ) in profits . This may be because we run three book fairs throughout the year . <p> Also , in addition to the $ profits , we receive a certain amount of credit that can be used to purchase books . We usually save this until the end of the year as that book fair is a BOGO ( buy one - get one free ) . We do n't make any profit from this fair , but it is so worth it . <p> The difference between what you are doing , and what we are getting , may be due to us holding three and that the last in the BOGO . <p> Good Evening . Our school has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( November &amp; April ) . This year was the first year ( some PTA law or something ) that we had to charge sales tax ... the PTA was not happy about it and neither were the parents . Charging sales tax really cut into the PTA 's profit . <p> I 'm not in Massachussetts , and I 've never coordinated our book fair , but I can tell you that the issue of whether or not the PTO/PTA should charge state sales tax has nothing to do with the group being a non-profit . The exemption from sales tax ( assuming it 's the same in your state ) affects only items your PTO purchases that support your PTO 's non-profit purpose . For example , if your PTO purchases books for educational enrichment that could be exempt from state sales tax . The exemption does not , however , extend to purchases made from your PTO by customers . Sales tax is unique for each state , so maybe Mass. has some complicated conditions . You might need to do some research on your own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue come up a few years ago with our fundraising rep from a national company . I was surprised that the company and the rep accepted our PTO 's tax i 'd number as " proof " that they should n't be charging us tax on our customer 's purchases . I expected the rep , a local , would be more knowledgeable on the tax rules and could give us guidance since they work in the industry every day . Unfortunately she seemed pretty uninformed . Frankly , I think they just wanted to ignore the whole tax issue and most PTO 's ( including us ) are more than happy to oblige . As I understand it , that 's not how the state expects it to work . If Scholastic or the PTO collects sales tax , the money must also then be remitted to the state . Obviously , you ca n't just collect it from your customers and then keep it . <p> Maybe now Scholastic and/or National PTA is trying to do things according to the rules in the state . You indicate there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. cash . I do n't see how that would have anything to do with whether or not your customers should be paying sales tax . Since you 're having these concerns , I would press the Scholastic rep for more information on why you should be charging tax . She should have been trained in this area . If she does n't sound confident , go above her . If you just ended your book fair and did n't  ' pass the sales tax on to your customers , you 'll have to pay it yourself . If the state requires the tax , that 's that . Better to get educated and handle things properly than ignore the rules . <p> I am in Colorado and we charge sells tax to the parents or kids but not to the teachers as they are tax exempt . We also take the 50% book profit as well I am not sure but have been asked the question as to why we charge tax at the book fairs and the santa gift shop . I though that we were not charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to charge the tax somewhere to get the state their take so it comes from your customers . Maybe we will get the answer from someone . 
@@35479249 @4479249/ <p> This question ( really about donation of funds , not items ) has raised some spirited discussion in another thread . It is something that definitely bears discussing , so I 'm starting this posting devoted to this issue . <p> I 've been reluctant to join in the fray , because I did n't have specific language/laws to cite . However , an IRS rep once told me it was fine - at least in our situation . Periodically , our Principal asks us to fund a variety of things and we transfer money to the school 's " Activity Account " . Sometimes it 's for a specific item ( for which they are paying ) . Our school year begins before our state 's fiscal year , and new budget , so the Principal also has to keep some startup funds in this account . If the account is too lean towards the end of the year , we may supplement it . The IRS rep with whom I spoke last year , said this was fine . <p> I have n't noticed the IRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other assets . If this were true for cash , how could we legally donate books , computers , and other resources to our schools ? <p> Let 's share knowledge about this question . We all know the tax laws can be murky . And , we 've probably all been given a very logical wrong answer by someone in authority at some point . But maybe together we can put this one to rest . <p> As I had stated in another thread , I called the IRS non-profit division after trying to decipher pages of tax laws and codes . As a 501(c) ( 3 ) we are clearly in the scope of our authority to donate to another 501c3 . The IRS expert mentioned that as long as we are operating within our scope-as acharitable organization-its perfectly legal to do so . <p> I only brought this up because I noticed that it was mentioned in a few posts recently that we could lose tax-exempt status if we donated to another 501c3 . I have been in the PTA for 10 years and had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in the past and probably will in the future donate to other charities . <p> OKAY JHB , you asked for it , below is a copy of a sample articles of incorporation that came directly from the IRS application for 501c3 tax exempt status ( i condensed it just a bit ) <p> LONG ... Sample Articles of Organization <p> The following are examples of a charter ( Draft A ) and a declaration of trust ( Draft that contain the required information as to purposes and powers of an organization and disposition of its assets upon dissolution . You should bear in mind that requirements for these instruments may vary under applicable state law . <p> Draft A <p> Articles of Incorporation of the under-signed , a majority of whom are citizens of the United States , desiring to form a Non-Profit Corporation under the Non-Profit Corporation Law of , do hereby certify : <p> First : The name of the Corporation shall be . <p> Second : The place in this state where the principal office of the Corporation is to be located is the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively for charitable , religious , educational , and scientific purposes , including , for such purposes , the making of distributions to or-ganizations federal tax code . <p> Fourth : The names and addresses of the ...... **29;1082;TOOLONG <p> As you can see , the IRS in their own example , has declared that contributions must be made exclusively to other 501c3 's . <p> So if there is anything else I left out , I 'm sorry . I missed the Sopranos researching this the other night ( its ok , repeats anyway ) . Now if I do n't finish the dinner dishes and get the kids ready for bed , I am going to miss West Wing , and that would be a tragedy . ( its a Rob Lowe thing ) <h> Reply to SFilak <p> I am CERTAIN that the IRS told me , too , that one 501c3 can donate to another 501c3 , no problem . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we can give cash away . <p> Our example : prior to filing for 501c3 , our PTO would give each teacher a check for her own use as she saw fit for classroom supplies ( or she could take her husband out to dinner ... we did n't care because every teacher spends way more of her own $ on classroom stuff anyway ) . When we began researching Form 1023 , I asked the IRS about this example . No , the rep said , it 's not kosher to just hand out cash anymore , because our PTO had no way of ensuring the $ was being used within the restrictions placed on a non-profit charity . Thus , the only way we could give the teachers $ was to reimburse receipts that proved the money was spent in accordance with the mission and constitution our PTO has filed with the IRS . <p> However , if we give $ to another 501c3 ( and all non-profit schools are automatically 501c3 ) , then the money is guarenteed to be used in accordance with the IRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide by the same rules that govern non-profit status . Makes sense ? <p> So , it 's completely backwards for someone to suggest that an organization could lose its nonprofit status for giving to another 501c3 . <p> IRS Publication 557 ( " Tax Exempt Status for Your Organization , page 4 ) lists the reasons why a 501c3 could have its status revoked . Basically , if your organization does n't do what you said itdoes , or you engaged in a prohibited acitivity of a 501c3 like intervening in the campaign for a candidate for public office ( see page 14 ) . <p> what kind of bothered me about this was this example , what if , my non- profit was given $1,000 , I took out a little to pay my employees and expenses and donated the rest to another non-profit ( school , charity , etc .... ) . They in turn , took out their expenses and donated the rest to another non profit , as opposed to actually buying food for homeless people , buying school supplies for children or whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated whatever they got left to another non profit and so on and so on until there 's nothing left or by the time it actually was put to use there was hardly anything left . Basically all the money was used for a variety of organizations expenses and salaries . <p> also related to this ...... can a non profit be a group that raises funds that solely distributes to other non profits , charity 's etc ..... ? and their existence is to just raise funds . <h> Reply to Jake <p> Jake -- Interesting points . Your question about can a nonprofit just raise money to distribute to other nonprofits -- the answer is yes . The United Way is probably the most well known example . But that does n't mean every nonprofit can do that . The IRS cares that you spend your money in line with your mission . If a parent group raised $10,000 a year and gave all of that money to a soup kitchen , that would n't be in line with their mission and they could lose their tax-exempt status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't raise eyebrows , and if it were in conjunction with a student community service project , it would actually fit their mission .

We have a person running for president who filed for bankruptcy bank in 1996 and we do n't want to jeopardize our non profit status because of his past . The President can write checks in our organization . <p> I would say that this is a personal financial situation that is 13 years old and irrelevant to this person serving on the board . I know of a very nice couple who many years ago had to file bankruptcy due to a law suit from a car accident involving their teenage son .

These are for your group 's protection as well as your president 's . Obviously , you ( and probably others ) are concerned about the circumstances and a bit suspicious of this person 's character . The president should welcome implementing tighter controls to hopefully reduce your concerns . Financial controls are appropriate for every PTO , not just one where there 's concern . Eliminate risk and you might just avoid tempting someone to do something bad . <p> Specifically , you should have a 2 signer rule for your checks . No check can be issued unless signed by 2 offiers ( usually Pres , VP , Trez are the authorized signers . The bank statement should be mailed to one of hte officers other than the Trez .

In your case , you might want to start with the Risk Assessment Checklist . Reviewing it will highlight places where your group should tighten controls , so the pressure to change comes from " the experts " rather than you personally . <p> Your concern is understandable , but if you put good controls in place , you can sleep soundly , and your president can prove her/himself a good leader without the cloud of suspicion . <p> How in the world do you know this much about someone running for office ?

Since , the principal and board had a meeting together , discussed her resignation and said the VP should fill the spot and we would hold a new election for the empty VP spot . Now the lady who resigned said it was not in front of the members at a meeting and therefor her resignation does not count and she still wants to be president . The board would rather her stay resigned as well as lots of the teachers and some parents . Now our by-laws are pretty vague so we would like to go by Robert 's Rules of Orders . I have looked on some sites for it and am not very good with the legal lingo . I need laymans terms . imgredface.gif So , here is the real question : Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and us having a board meeting about it and trying to move on and keep the PTO going , or does it have to be at an actual members meeting with members present and have it voted on ? : confused : : confused : Please help ! ! Thank you ! ! ! <h> Reply to Buckeye PTO <p> I do n't know what RRO say on this matter ( but that wo n't stop me ) . Since your by-laws are vague in this area , here is my humble opinion how to interpret the situation . <p> The sticking point is going to be if teh e-mail is valid . <p> If she sent a signed piece of paper saying " I resign ... " and the board voted to accept the resignation , then it is done deal - she is out and the replacement process is followed . ( Although if she changes her mind she should have the right to try and replace herself if she so chooses ) . <p> The board vote to accept the resignation needs to be " on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting ) before she decided to rescind her resignation . I am assuming the by-laws are clear that the board has the authority to act on it 's own in some matters - this would naturally be one of them . <p> However , since the ex-pres sent her resignation notice as an e-mail , there may be some small question whether that is valid . She could claim , for instance , that the e-mail was not hers that someone else was " spoofing " her e-mail account without authorization . If she maid this claim , I think she would have a valid aregument for the board to acknowledge that the vote to accept the resignation is null-and-void , since the resignation was not valid . However , she did not make this claim and ( it is implied ) acknowledged the e-mail resignation letter was hers . In which case , I think you are back on safe ground in leaving her the ex-pres and moving on with filling the position . <h> Reply to Phil Bernstein <p> For her resignation to become effective , the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it would take to have her outta there . If the board did not decide -by voice vote , ballot or general consent- to accept her resignation , then she 's still in . She is allowed , per RONR , to rescind her offer of resignation up until the moment someone on the board seconds a motion " to accept her resignation " . Best advice I can give is when a resignation is offered , hold an emergency meeting immediately and move to accept it or " you snooze , you loose " . I 'd read your bylaws and not go by anyone 's interpretation of succession of office . <h> Reply to &amp;lt ; mrs.inConn&amp;gt ; <p> Well actually , unless RRO has changed it 's standing , I understand that when a resignation is submittedin writting ( as it was ) the governing body can accept it as is which , in effect , is excusing them from office . OR AT THE TIME THE NOTICE is read can turn it over to the membership to vote . <p> SO according to Roberts Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new copy ! ) yor President has offically resigned and will need to be re-elected if she has changed her mind . OR go through the more confusing step of rescinding her resignation but either way you need a membership vote . <p> Oh , and you do n't need to vote for a VP unless your by-laws do n't not allow for the Secretary or Treasurer to " fill-in " when needed . Also if you have specific duties that need to be done by te VP you should consider opening elections for the seat . <p> What would I do ? Open elections for both offices and pray for the best ! <p> and the website I love when my little RRO book is lost , www.robertsrules.com they have a great Q&amp;A forum , too ! <p> RONR has n't changed- much- from 9th to 10th ed . This answer is directly pertaining to a resignation FROM an elected office . A resignation is a " request to be excused from a duty " . Yes , the governing body ( board ) can accept , reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in a position to act on it . That position is a duly called meeting with a quorum . The chair reads the resignation letter ( if it 's written ) and USUALLY it is accepted by general consent .

Having the books brought in before the event allows us to have a wider selection of books ( and have them sorted ) right from the beginning . To keep track of what has been brought in , we give each teacher a class roster sheet to mark the qty of books next to the child 's name .

Especially if the books that they brought in , have been taken already by another child . <p> We 've never had that happen since we have such a huge selection which includes many new books that we purchased as I described above , but I guess I would make them some kind of voucher for the next exchange or maybe give them a small gift certificate to our next book fair if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bring their books with them to the exchange I do n't put the students books on the exchange table until they 've made a selection just because I usually do n't have time right then .

Guidelines on when to take minutes and what to record . <p> by Craig Bystrynski <p> 03/02/2017 <p> Taking minutes is a key role at any meeting . But it 's often a function that 's taken for granted . Anyone can take notes , right ? Actually , meeting minutes play a key legal function , and it 's important to take them correctly . Here are some notable dos and don'ts when it comes to taking minutes . <p> Do keep minutes at all general meetings and board meetings . If your group is incorporated , this is one way to maintain the legal protection the corporate shield gives to your officers . <p> Do keep minutes at any meeting where people vote . At committee meetings where there is no voting , you might choose to keep minutes for your records . But minutes are not required for legal purposes . <p> Do list where the meeting takes place , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of attendees ( approximate if the group is large ) and whether a quorum is present . <p> Do format your notes to follow the agenda . If you do n't normally create an agenda , you should . It makes the meeting more orderly , let 's attendees know what to expect at the meeting , and makes taking minutes significantly easier . <p> Do record all motions and the outcome of votes . <p> Do be concise . It 's not necessary to go on at length in the minutes . Just record specific motions and votes , and key business . <p> Do n't list the names of people who make and second motions . You might put individuals on the spot in case of a lawsuit . ( And yes , it does happen . ) <p> Do n't detail the debate over an issue . In your formal notes , you just need the facts . Minutes should record what is done at meetings , not what is said . <p> Do n't list the vote count . Outcome is enough . <p> Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a point straight in your notes . <p> Do n't wait to type up the minutes from your notes . Do it the same day or the next day , while you still remember what occurred . <p> As on all matters of meeting procedure , Robert 's Rules of Order offers information on taking proper minutes . A good reference that 's easier to follow than simply reading Robert 's Rules is Webster 's New World Robert 's Rules of Order , Simplified and Applied . <p> MIDad -- That advice comes from an attorney who specializes in nonprofits , works with lots of PTOs , and has been a PTO president . It 's certainly cautious advice , and the odds are low -- but not zero -- that someone who made a motion would be included in a lawsuit against the PTO . You ask about successful lawsuits , but defending against a lawsuit is expensive whether or not the lawsuit is successful . <p> On the other hand , from my point of view , there 's little value in including the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never heard of a PTO member running for office based on the motions they sponsored , for example . But , as you note , all of this is just advice . It 's up to each group to decide what 's best for them . <p> How do you reconcile your guidance not to record the names of people making motions with Robert 's Rules of Order , which say , " The body of the minutes should contain ... in the case of all important motions , the name of the mover ... " ? And can you provide citations for a *successful* lawsuit over a motion made in any deliberative body ? <p> Maybe you could add a " DO " to type the notes as the meeting occurs versus slowly handwriting them to transcribe later . This will help to ensure you do n't forget important facts and can greatly help you to become more efficient with your time .

A set amount based on a predetermined set of criteria . The money is paid out normally after Christmas and basically is just a check written to each teacher for the amount . The amount is normally around $100 or so . So , while it is n't huge but it is n't something to sneeze at either . <p> I was just talking to a friend of mine who moved and is now part of a PTA . We were discussing some of the differences and she was commenting about how the PTA paid the stipends , etc . And she said that the teacher only gets the stipend if they join the PTA . <p> We have never required the teacher to join the PTO to get their stipend , we have always just paid it to all teachers . And last year we did have more teacher 's join the PTO then in years past but out of 49 checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our membership fee is only $5 per family , which is n't a huge amount , imo . <p> So , my questions are : <p> 1 . Do other schools pay stipends to their teachers ? 2 .

( $50 , $100 , whatever was decided that year ) . This was announced to all teachers and they submitted receipts to our treasurer . Not piecemeal but to get the whole amount . We never scrutinized exactly what they bought for the classroom , but we did require receipts as that is how the IRS and our auditor required it be handled . <p> As far as who got it , PTO membership was n't a factor .

I feel that there should be some standard amount given and some guidelines for when memorial gifts sould be given . Do any of you have guidelines or how do you keep things fair and equal amoung the staff . <p> Do you think that it is inappropriate to say when a staff retires they are given a gift that is similiar to their years of service . ex , $25 for every 5 yrs of service in the district . We had 2 teachers retire with almost the same amount of years , one was given $100 at the end of last school year . The reading teacher retiring in Feb is being given $200 . <p> Does your PTO give memorial gifts for staff members who had a parent-in-law pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set amount either , but we 've never had more than one retire in the same year at our school where there would be the potential for hurt feelings . Our amounts have varied also . Alot has depended on the relationship between the particular teacher and our organization . We had a teacher who was very supportive of our PTA , chaired and worked on many committees , never missed a meeting , and in fact many of us did n't even realize how much she did until she was gone and it was n't getting done anymore ! So our gift cost $100 . Since then most of our gifts have been around $30.00 because we 've gone in with staff and bought a large gift/party for them . Our principal retired last year and we did give $100.00 for her party as well as $50.00 toward her big gift and then we had a lot of smaller " home made " gifts that we initiated and worked on with students . As far as memorials for deaths , we normally buy a nice hardcover book for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course there 's an emblem placed inside the book - " In memory of ... " . We have limited this to the staff persons spouse , children , or parents . We do not do it for inlaws . We had to draw the line somewhere and that 's where we drew it . If it 's some other relative we just give them a sympathy card . The only exception was the principal 's mother . We sent flowers for the funeral and donated the book . <h> Reply to PTA Pres <p> In our budget that we present at the beginning of the year we have a " special occasion " section where it was voted upon to keep $200.00 in that account . If someone passes away or retires we usually send flowers or buy something usually for around $50.00 . We also buy gifts if a teacher gets married or has a baby.By having the money already approved it cuts down on having to take votes or waiting until the next meeting to ask the general membership to approve . If we go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $50.00 approved . <h> Reply to chrystal <p> We also budget so much money for gifts etc . When staff is sick ( in hospital ) we sennd flowers , retirements , we give gifts based on the teachers interests . The cost of a retirement gift does depend on how long a teacher has been in the school to a point . If we go over the budget , I can approve cost up to $100 and the executive board can approve up to $500 . <h> Reply to Pres88 <p> Hi , We adopted guidelines for retirement and memorial gifts into our bylaws . Unless there is a hardship issue , we donate a book to the school library in the person 's name . Our librarian is wonderful , she finds out about the person retiring or who passed away , and picks a book that reflects that person . She puts a plate in the front of the book to memorialize the honoree , and it can be enjoyed by many children . Carrie

I have changed and reorganized several aspects of our PTO , but have done nothing with the very old system of Room Mothers in our Elementary school . It has been done the same for years and I am looking for some new or fresh ideas for them . In the past our PTO has selected two mothers from each classroom to serve as Room Mothers ( one for the Fall party and one for the Valentine party ) . We have also donated $30 to each classroom for the the two parties combined . The parties are the only responsibilites or " jobs " the Room Mothers have . I would like to see them become more involved in other ways and to find other fun projects that we could use our Room Moms for . How does your school handle Room Mothers and class parties ? What are the " jobs " of your Room Mothers ? Let me know some of your great ideas ! Thanks ! <h> Reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday parties , assist teachers and actually acts as heads of their classrooms . <p> Our room mothers are our links to the other parents . We use our mothers as phone chains within the school . If we need to relay important reminders , etc. we use our room mothers to contact the other parents in their group . Parents are more receptive to other parents than to PTO board members ( I think they forget we 're parents too ) . <p> This year we are also trying to get our room mothers more involved . We have two moms that we have actually appointed Chairpeople of the Roommothers . <h> Reply to CoPREZ <p> Our board is also clarifying the role of the Head Room Parent . In addition to traditional role of planning the class parties , we want the volunteers to understand up front that they will be expected also to be the primary liaison between the teacher and other class parents , to set up a telephone phone chain for their class , and to recruit class volunteers for school-wide or PTO projects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before they sign up . Last year we had a room parent complain because she was asked by the Staff Appreciation committee to help organize a gift for the teacher . Apparently this mom only wanted to plan parties . We hope that by clearly defining the ( expanded ) role of the Head Room parent , volunteers will know what they 're getting into . <p> Typically , we have a HEAD Head Room Parent - someone who is the overseer of the program , who calls one kickoff meeting a year , and who distributes an idea packet for party planning . In addition to each class 's Head Room Parent , we encourage other parents to sign up to help as needed . <p> As far as class party money goes , we ask each parent to contribute $5 per child for the year 's parties . Each Head Room parent manages the class 's money . The PTO itself does not reimburse for class party expenses nor subsidize class accounts . <p> We have two committee co-chairs that organize the room reps , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no limit to how many each class has but only 4 can help at each of our 3 parties . The chairs man a table used a sign in the reps and provide name badges on the days of the parties for crowd control and security . <p> On a daily basis we have a whole network of moms and dads that come in to specifically help their child 's teacher . They might pass out stuff to take home , help the kids read privately , test them on spelling or math minutes . These daily people help out and communicate strictly with the teacher and must enter through the office like any visitor , but we do n't manage them . However , they are typically our room reps . You 'll never guess who are field trip chaperones usually are ? <p> We give each class $30 for room parties . We found that asking over and over is more trouble then it worth and we are already hitting them up for Fall fundraisers and volunteering at that time anyway . We buy all the paper goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close outs and get the stuff early and in bulk . It 's all part of the budget . <p> We usually go to room moms first when it comes to things like getting the word out and helping at field day . We communicate to the teachers through the principal and teacher reps . <p> Our only issue is some room reps like to organize the teachers gifts and send out letters asking for a donation for a collective gift . Sounds nice and thoughtful right ? No , for some reason other parents always call and complain . Some actually complain that teachers get paid and they do n't need a gift . So Staff appreciation is a separate thing and all staff members receive equal items . : confused : <p> All of this is explained at a training meeting at the beginning of the year . We also have Great Art show &amp; tell and a publishing center that gets moms and dads interacting with the classrooms and their own kids . <h> Reply to tradechi <p> Our room parents organize the parties , do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their class for the spring carnival . Our sign up sheets also have areas for parents to sign up who wish to help with any of these events . <p> Thank-you for the ideas . I was kind of thinking along the those same lines as far as " responsibilities " of the Room Moms . I am always trying to come up with ways to get more parents involved instead of always the same few . I am hoping that making some of these changes in what the Room Moms do will help . Thanks again ! I 'll keep checking for any more ideas !

Needless to say , this has caused conflict in the past . <p> The irony of commitment is that it+GGs deeply liberating-in work , in play , in love .

The speaker for the meeting shows up 20 minutes late . The three late additions to the field trip mean you 're a car short . Somebody 's handwriting is illegible on the fundraiser order forms , causing you to order too little " or too much . <p> But you can avoid the full-fledged crises that bring on major migraines , knotted stomachs , and the occasional chocolate binge . It just takes a little planning and organization to keep the stress meter below the red zone all year long . Not only that , but later in the year people will be wondering just how you do it . There are so many things to worry about , yet you seem so calm . What 's your secret ? Your secret is you 've been organized from the start . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody will call you a natural-born leader . <h> 1 . Get in your zone . <p> You 're busy . You have kids and commitments . Sometimes it seems like you 're living life on the fly . To be a successful parent group leader , you need to create a little calm among the craziness . Set aside a corner of your house " a desk , a bookcase , the computer table , even a large box under the counter " to organize all of your PTO resources . Keep all of your books , calendar , notes for upcoming projects , and anything else PTO-related in this space . Make sure your phone list is easy to get to ! Keeping your tools centralized is easy , and it will have a big effect on your organization and efficiency in the upcoming year . <h> 2 . Acquaint yourself with your resources . <p> Would n't it be great to have a broad support system of information and advice in place ? You 'd always have access to a wealth of ideas and solutions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it . The basis of your network can be past board members and officers . If last year 's president is a little burned out or too busy , what about the president from the year before ? Or the year before that ? Get their contact information from other board members or the principal . And do n't be afraid to seek advice from long-standing members of the group . Even if they are n't officers , they will have insight into how things work , as well as what worked in the past and what did n't . <p> Leaders of other parent groups generally are happy to share information , too . Call or email the leaders of two or three local groups at the beginning of the year to introduce yourself . Wish them a good year , and suggest that if there 's anything you can do for mutual support , you would be willing . This initial contact could really pay off later when you need advice . You 'll also find plenty of people willing to help on the ptotoday.com message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have several members or a number of willing volunteers , create a phone tree . You should never have to make 20 or 30 calls yourself . This is a simple job that easily can be shared . Just pick out five people that you will call , and give each of them five people to call . That 's 30 people notified of important information , such as a time change for a meeting or event , and you had to make only five calls . Set this up now . That way you make sure everyone gets the message when something important comes up . <p> Supplement your telephone tree with email . This is a quick , efficient form of communication , so make sure you gather email addresses from everyone in your group who has one . If you do n't have online access , assign this task to a trusted group member who does . E-mail programs allow you to send messages to multiple users simply by typing in all of the addresses , separated by commas , you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses as a group in the address-book function of your program . That way you can contact everybody with just the click of a button . <p> Consider making email templates for your common correspondence . If you send an email each month notifying members of the meeting date and time , create a brief letter that can be used over and over . Just update the pertinent information each time you use it . <h> 4 . Jump-start the important stuff . <p> Set your priorities based on activities that are time-sensitive or need a lot of lead time . For example if you 're in charge of programs , speakers may get busy early , so book the main speakers as soon as possible , and then fill in the rest of the details as the events approach . If you are hosting a chicken dinner off school grounds , you may need to rent the hall well in advance . Any event that needs to be coordinated with the school district , such as a fair that requires school district equipment , should be on the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drop them a line . <p> Do you have a membership questionnaire ? If so , you should get it out to as many people as possible . If not , you should create one . A good questionnaire provides information on people 's interests and gives you an easy source of contact information . <p> Distribute the questionnaire at kindergarten orientation and at open house " two opportunities you have to connect with new parents . But do n't stop there . Do a mailing to parents " members and non-members alike . This questionnaire should explain the different duties in the PTO and ask parents what they would be willing to help with . Include everything from baking for a sale , typing , and being on the phone tree to chairing or cochairing a committee . Also , you might ask what the parents would like to see the group do and what events they would like to see held . <p> The key to making these questionnaires work for you is to use them . Do n't just put them in a folder . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phone numbers and email addresses for the phone and email trees . <p> A list of event ideas and suggestions , just as you would in a brainstorming session . <p> A list of volunteers , including specifics of what they are willing to do . <p> To really get on top of your year , pass out a second questionnaire to the teachers to ask what they need from the PTO and what they want from you . That way you can be prepared , and there are no surprises . You can also ask what level of involvement they want to have this year so you 'll know which teachers to call on . <h> 6 . Create your own PTO yellow pages . <p> Here 's a great idea from Huntertown ( Ind . ) Elementary School 's Wildcat PTO . Copresident Joe Hyndman created a yellow pages for committee chairs using the information he received from returned questionnaires . Hyndman divided his booklet into separate listings , such as typing and baking . " The challenge is always getting more parents to volunteer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the chairperson or tackle a task . " Chairpeople get a copy of the " PTyellOw Pages " to find the volunteers they need . <p> " There 's also a heading for people willing to be on a two- or three-person team to chair a committee . This makes it easier for people to get involved and gets people looking beyond their own circle of friends . " Hyndman says using the PTO yellow pages spreads the labor around so no one individual gets called all of the time , and all of the parents who volunteered get to be involved . <h> 7 . Make a paper trail . <p> As president , you need to be organized , but so do your chairpeople if you want the year to run smoothly . Each chair should keep a procedure book . You can prepare a book for them . The procedure book is a three-ring binder containing your PTO 's bylaws , minutes from meetings , budgets , a board roster , and treasurer 's notes , among other information . For each chair , add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other information you think would be useful . For your publicity chair , for example , add the names of local education reporters and contacts at the television stations . Include copies of old press releases to give him a head start . For fundraising chairs , include notes from past fundraisers . Also include catalogs and Web addresses from vendors , along with notes about the contacts " who was easy to work with , for instance . <p> Each chairperson should add information as the year goes on , then pass the binder to the next chair . Each chairperson also should include notes and plans for his specific tasks , including a follow-up for each event or project that gives feedback about what worked and what did n't . With this in hand , events are easier to run from year to year . It 's very important to keep track of every committee 's expenditures so that you 'll know how to set up the budget for the next year . <p> As an alternative to or an addition to the multiple binders , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portable file such as a milk crate . Each event " chicken dinner or plant sale " gets a folder , and the chairperson is responsible for filling the folder during and after the event . The folder should contain the procedures for that event , what the event entails , how far in advance the tasks have to be done , and vendors contacted in the past . Having this information at hand for yourself and for the chairperson will make sure there are no surprises for upcoming events . <h> 8 . Lay the foundation for publicity . <p> Do you think you need publicity ? Publicizing your group 's activities is a great way to find new members . Furthermore , publicity such as a photo in the local newspaper or a general-interest item on the local television news is a great pat on the back for the person running the event . What a way to get volunteers excited ! <p> Getting publicity for your events will be easy if you take the time to set up contacts now . One way to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call local education reporters and offer to be a source of information about schools . If you help them out or at least introduce yourself , it will be easier when you want your event covered . <p> As you plan your calendar , keep in mind events that will be picture-worthy . A photo of children sitting behind desks may not strike fire in an editor 's heart , but photos of kids planting trees , walking in a walkathon , or visiting with the elderly will be easy sells . <h> 9 . Cultivate successors . <p> It 's not always easy to find willing volunteers for key spots on the board . As you well know , the work can be intense . But you do n't want just warm bodies filling the slots . You 've worked hard , and you want the group to run as well as it has during your term . Three weeks before elections is no time to be scrambling to think of candidates . <p> Consider as possible candidates people who have been very helpful and organized . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been helped with those assignments and thanked and celebrated for their success , they might even be eager for a leadership position . <p> Keep in mind that partnerships also can work well . Co-presidents or board members should have complementary skills . Hyndman 's copresident at the Huntertown Elementary PTO , Linda Anderson , has a good connection with the parents and teachers . Hyndman enjoys working behind the scenes , with communication and the technical side of events . Talk to the possible candidates about the job as the year goes on . Starting early let 's you train successors easily as you accomplish your normal duties . <h> A Fast Start <p> Here are two ideas to clip and save for the end of the year . If you follow them in June , you 'll get next year off to an even faster start . <p> Year-at-a-glance . Set next year 's dates in conjunction with the principal at the end of this school year . Make sure the principal sets those dates on the school and district calendars . This prevents scheduling problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a big annual calendar , you can also space out events so the individuals and committees involved do n't get overwhelmed . And if you have your calendar set up early , you can publish it on a refrigerator magnet to send out to your members . <p> Meet early . Hold a goal-setting meeting for newly elected officers before they take office . Hosting an event with the current and future boards creates a forum for the outgoing officers to pass on useful tips and hints . The new president should also have new board members meet to get to know each other early in the summer . They can share ideas then ot get the brainstorming going . If you get some events and activities nailed down " and if you have volunteers " you can get people moving early . <p> I am a Guidance Officer from Trinidad , West Indies .

You could set up a morning coffee for one month and then do an evening get together the next month . ( This way , you are accommodating the different schedules parents have . ) Keep it casual . Invite parents by asking them to come share their ideas . Yes , you want to let them know about your group , but it helps a lot to get parent feedback . Plus , this helps parents feel included .

Very few people know what you do every day and the challenges you overcome and the unique satisfaction of watching your hard work pay off for the school . <p> It 's why I think it 's so important to find a network of other leaders to connect with . Whether it 's real or virtual , finding your own coffee club of PTO or PTA leaders is a huge win . Practically speaking , trading ideas and best practices is really helpful . But it 's just as important to have folks who can pick you up on that day when the principal says just the wrong thing and to keep you going when it seems no one else will volunteer for anything . <p> This week , I have three great ways for you to find that network : <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts make up the most active old-school community around . Add your own questions and insights . <p> 3 . Finally , if you 're near one of our nine remaining PTO Expo locales for 2014 , then you have the best networking opportunity out there . Come and join us for an hour or two or a whole day of networking and ideas and samples and prizes and fun . I guarantee you 'll enjoy the experience and get a lot out of it . More than 25,000 leaders have attended one or more of our Expos these past few years . It 's an awesome chance to connect -- we hope to see you there !

That could only mean one thing : Fall carnivals and harvest festivals are under way . <p> There 's something really special about these events . For starters , they are all about fun .

The weather is beautiful ( especially in New England , if we can brag for a moment ! ) and families are settled into the school routine and feeling comfortable . Kids have made some early friendships . It 's the perfect time to develop a sense of community and school spirit that PTOs and PTAs can build on throughout the school year . <p> If your group hosts an annual event , try adding a few different activities this year to give it a fresh feeling . We 've compiled many new game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinterest . One of our favorites is a game that involves tossing a sponge at a principal !

I recently started my own business as medical biller/coder and currently have 2 clients . i also have 3 children , whice 2 is in school and 3 yr old boy at home with me. my husband works and hardly home during the day to help out.My question is can you give me some advice on balancing my kids , housework , job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confind to a wheelchair and i also take my sister and neice and nephew home from school . i do not want to ignore my children because they are the reason i started my business at home , i also do not want to loose my clients ( doctors ) but it is so much and when i try to request more volunteers to help th epto out all they do is try to compete that they have harder life than myself . I never meant that i have a harder and more hectec life just that some tasks can be requested my office staff and room mothers/fathers.Am i wrong to say that to my pto officers ?

During that time , the Principal was allowed to receive $2,000 in funds ( discretionary ) , in which I was the only Board member not to approve . I requested ( via email ) that we have receipts to be documented . Before I left ( as treasurer ) , I never received the receipts . Now , as a parent , I asked for it again , this is the response I got " The Board has reviewed the receipts and have determined that the same were sufficient to support the annual gift to the school . We are not in the practice of sending out copies of our records to parents . " Do I have the right to see the receipts ? Thanks , Rich <p> Craig writes:Not in a legal sense .

There should be a receipt for all purchases . If the principal wants an expense line item and the pto approves that then all of the purchases should be transparent . If the PTO Board is being secretive about expenditures then someone needs to speak up . Request an audit from an outside source . Something is very wrong if no one wants to show any records . PTO 's job is raise money for the students and teacher benefits . PTO survives off of the community . The people have every right to know where their money is being spent .

The preschool is a parochial preschool and uses the church 's non-profit status and EIN # for past functions . In starting a PTO , will we have to have our own number or can we use the preschool's/church 's ? <p> Rose H writes:Thanks for getting in touch and great to hear that you will be starting a parent group . There is n't exactly a right or wrong answer here . It depends on the level of independence your group wants to have . If you want to set up the group as a separate operation from the preschool/church , that independently makes decisions about fundraising , events , etc. , then it likely makes sense to go with 501c(3) status . If , however , you anticipate being more part of the preschool/church , then you do n't have to take that step . You might want to take a look at our PTO Startup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a group .

Our own By-Laws mandate that IF they are held on school property the proper forms are submitted and approved prior . If they are held off site , you must secure the proper authorizations from that site and insurance . Unfortunately due to many people relaying their mistrust in the administration , and retaliation taking place against their kids they do not want it on school grounds . Please confirm , as our own corp we can do this ? <p> Rose H writes:You can , but the bigger question here is does it make sense to do so ?

We 've applied for retroactive reinstatement and are waiting to get it back . In the meantime I have to file a 1120 form as a corporation and pay taxes ! Our receipts are only about $2000 and I 'm looking for miscellaneous deductions that our PTO can legitimately take We give all of our reciepts back to the school in the form of funding fields trips , buying gym equipment , etc . Can I take these expenses as business expenses related to our business activity ? This part of the 1120 tax return is confusing when we are essentially a non profit . Help ! <p> You should n't have to file as a corporation . You can restart the 501(c) ( 3 ) process .

Our PTO was concerned about our status and about missing another filing deadline so I asked the IRS what to do while we 're waiting for a reinstatement decision and technically not a non profit entity . He told me we are obligated to file the 1120 corporate tax return , then amend it if we get 501(c) ( 3 ) status back . Other organizations need to be aware of this
