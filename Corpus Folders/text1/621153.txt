@@118719533 @7719533/ <h> INTRODUCTION <p> Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the Neomail version 1.14 from Ernie Miller . Open WebMail is designed to manage very large mail folder files in a memory efficient way . It also provides a range of features to help users migrate smoothly from Microsoft Outlook to Open WebMail . <h> FEATURES for Users <h> Auto Login <p> Each user can determinte if he want to enable the auto login feature in Open WebMail . When enabled , the user do n't have type his username and password in every login to Open WebMail . Open WebMail will do this automatically for him . However , for security reason , the auto login feature will be actived only if user does n't log out in previous session and the previous session is still not timeouted . Further more , the sysadm can limit the range of IPs that are allowed to use the auto login feature . <h> Multiple Languages/Multiple Charsets <p> Open WebMail is currently available for more than 30 languages , and it is quite easy to add new language to Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than one charsets , Open WebMail will choose one as the default charset for the language . If a message is written with charset other than the default , it will be converted to the default charset automatically . <h> Strong MIME Message Capability <p> Open WebMail has very well support for MIME messages . While most webmail packages present MIME messages poorly compared to traditional POP clients , Open Webmail presents MIME messages in an attractive format comparable to that presented by Microsoft Outlook . Either inline or uuencoded attachments are supported . <p> In addition to the presention , Open WebMail also allow user to compose complex HTML messages with inline attachments or external attachments . A friendly WYSIWYG editor HTMLArea 3.0 has been built into Open WebMail , the user can write HTML messages conformtably and easily without any knowledge of HTML tags . This HTML editor can be used on IE5.5+ for Windows or Mozilla1.3+ for all platforms : ) <h> Full Content Search <p> Full content search with regular expression support is provided . When a user enters a keyword in the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the keyword related messages . This means the user can use the sort or static functions on the search result . The scope limit is released when the user selects another folder or refreshes the current folder . <h> Draft Folder Support <p> This feature enables the user to write a message in a number of stages , even over several days . The user can save an unfinished message into the draft folder and continue editing at any time . <h> Confirm Reading Support <p> The user can request a ' confirm-reading receipt ' for each message sent . When the message is read by the recipient , a receipt will be sent back to this user . <h> Spelling Check Support <p> The spelling check in Open WebMail is very user-friendly and powerful : It makes suggestions for mis-spelled words , and the user can correct the errors very easily by selecting one of the suggestions from a drop-down menu . <h> vCard compliant Addressbook <p> The addressbook is greatly improved by Alex Teslik since 10/30/2004 . The new system implements a completely vCard compliant system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any contact software out in the mainstream . This brings OpenWebMail up to date with current address technology and allows sharing of addressbook information among users . <h> POP3 Support <p> Multiple POP3 accounts can be defined , allowing a single user to fetch mails from a number of mail servers . All messages fetched will be stored in the INBOX folder . Should the fetch operation exceed 10 seconds ( due to a slow link or large message for example ) , the operation will be put into background to avoid an http timeout . <h> Mail Filter Support <p> Multiple filter rules can be set to move or copy incoming mails to different folders automatically or even delete them directly . The user can categorize mails from a specific person or spammer , and identify mails containing viruses very easily by defining rules of sender , receiver , SMTP relay , subject , body or filename of attachments . <p> Since mail filtering is activated only in Open WebMail , messages will stay in the INBOX until the user reads their mail with Open WebMail. ' finger ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrectly , since they are not aware of filters : A command tool ' openwebmail-tool.pl ' is provided for use as finger replacement , which performs mail filtering before reporting mail status . <p> Open WebMail can use the SpamAssassin as the external spamcheck module to scan messages fetched from pop3 servers or all incoming messages . The SpamAssassin will determine a spamlevel for each scanned message based on its content . The user can define a spamlevel threshold for all his messages in Open WebMail , any message with spamlevel more than this threshold will be moved from INBOX to the SPAM folder automatically . <p> Open WebMail also supports the Spam/NotSpam Learning through the sa-learn program in SpamAssassin . In case the spamlevel determined by SpamAssassin is not very appropriate , the user can train the system by telling it to learn the messages as Spam or NotSpam . <p> Open WebMail can use the ClamAV as the external viruscheck module to scan messages fetched from pop3 servers or all incoming messages . If a message or its attachments is found to have virus , Open WebMail will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Calendar with Reminder/Notification Support <p> The user can keep track of their appointments , meetings , birthdays , whatever , with the build-in calendar in Open WebMail . This calendar provides several views , including year view , month view , week view and day view , so the user can browse their scheduled events very easily . There is also reminder support for scheduled events , user can specify the days that the reminder should look ahead and the first 5 upcoming events will be displayed in the top of mail folder view . If the user want the event reminder to be available outside the webmail system , he can also specify a notification email address , eg : the one used by mobile phone , for each scheduled event , so he can get notification of these events on his mobile phone . <h> Webdisk Support <p> The webdisk module provides a web interface for user to use his home directory as a virtual disk on the web . It is also designed as a storage of the mail attachments , the user can freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The / of the virtual disk is mapped to the user 's home directory , any item displayed in the virtual disk is actually located under the user home directory . <p> Webdisk supports basic file operations , eg : mkdir , rmdir , copy , move , rm , file upload and download . Download of multiple files or directories is supported , webdisk compresses the files into a zip stream on the fly in the transmission . It also handle many types of archives , including zip , arj , rar , tar.gz , tar.bz , tar.bz2 , tgz , tbz , gz , z .... The user can compress , decompress or list the contents of archives without copying them into his computer . <h> HTTP Compression <p> Open WebMail supports compression of HTML content over HTTP . With compression turned on , the average page size has been reduced for over 80% . This feature effectively reduces the use of nework bandwidth between the client computer and the webmail server and is very useful for users with slow connection to the webmail server , eg : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Fast Folder Access <p> Folder access performance is greatly improved through the use of dbm ( a simple database provided by perl ) . When a mail folder is selected in the folder view , Open WebMail will parse the mail folder file and cache the parsed result to a dbm . This dbm is reused whenever the user wants to access the folder . The dbm cache eliminates the scan of an entire folder for every access , a significant benefit when dealing with a large folders . The dbm is automatically synchronized with any changes to the folder itself ; the dbm update is incremental if the folder modification is done by the Open WebMail application itself . The dbm will however be recreated when a folder is found to have been changed by an external program . <h> Efficient Message Movement <p> The size of a message will be slightly increased after it is read at the first time because of status change . A large movement of messages may be introduced due to the size change . Also , the user may want to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for message update and movement have been totally rewritten so that minimal movement occurs , with correspondingly minimal memory utilization . <h> Smaller Memory Footprint <p> Much effort has been put into optimizing Open WebMail 's memory utilization . The memory footprint of Open WebMail is much smaller than its predecessors when dealing with messages with large attachments ( e.g. a 20MB document ) , as a result of which the application now runs smoothly on a medium sized machine , ( e.g. a Celeron 300 with 128MB RAM ) . <h> Graceful File Lock <p> Since a mail folder may be used by multiple programs simultaneously , it is necessary to lock the file before accessing the folder . Open WebMail uses a blocking lock with a timeout limit of 60 seconds . It gives the lock a better chance of success than a nonblocking lock , which returns an error if the lock can not be acquired immediately . Open WebMail also supports locking by dotlock file to ensure that the file locking operates correctly on platforms operating with an incomplete implementation of NFS lockd . <h> Remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMTP module , openwebmail can talk SMTP to SMTP daemons on either localhost or remote machine . This gives openwebmail the better compatibility with various SMTP daemons . The system administrator also has more flexibility when designing the mail service system . <h> Various Authentication Modules <p> Various authentication modules are directly available for openwebmail , including authunix.pl , authldap.pl , authmysql.pl , authpgsql.pl and authpop3.pl , authvm-pop3d.pl . With these modules , openwebmail can be integrated with other systems easily . <h> PAM support <p> Openwebmail can also use other sources for authentication through the PAM ( pluggable authentication module ) . Ex : NIS+ , NIS , LDAP , Radius .... Solaris 2.6 , Linux and FreeBSD 3.1 are known to support PAM . For more information about PAM , please see http : **36;89;TOOLONG <h> Virtual Hosting <p> You can have as many virtual domains as you want on same server with only one copy of openwebmail installed . Open Webmail supports per domain config file . Each domain can have its own set of configuration options , including domainname , authentication module , quota limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sendmail virtusertable for user alias mapping . The loginname typed by user may be pure name or name@somedomain . And this loginname can be mapped to another pure name or name@otherdomain in the virtusertable . This gives you the great flexibility in account management . For example , you may have john for different domains by actually mapping them to different real user ids . <p> john@domain1.com john1 john@domain2.com john2 john@domain3.com john3 <h> Pure Virtual User Support <p> Pure virtual user means a mail user who can use pop3 or openwebmail to access his mails on the mail server but actually has no unix account on the server . Openwebmail pure virtual user support is currently available for system running vm-pop3d + PostFix . The authentication module authvdomain.pl is designed for this purpose . Openwebmail also provides the web interface which can be used to manage(add/delete/edit) these virtual users under various virtual domains . Kevin L. Ellis has written a tutorial for openwebmail + vm-pop3d + postfix for this . <h> Per User Capability Configuration <p> While options in system config file(openwebmail.conf) are applied to all users , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user basis sometimes . For example , you may want to limit the client ip access for some users or limit the domain which the user can sent to . This could be easily done with the per user config file support in Open Webmail . <p> There are too many other small enhancements to mention . You may choose to find them by yourself ... <h> AUTHENTICATION MODULES <p> Open Webmail has the following modules to support different types of authentication : <p> Thanks to Sam Horrocks. who wrote the SpeedyCGI package , which is a perl accelerator by making script resident in memory . It improves the performance of Open WebMail for 5x-10x speedup . Sam also provided the fix for setuid scripts to us , so Open WebMail can be used with SpeedyCGI on Solaris . <p> Thanks to interactivetools.com. who wrote the great HTMLArea editor , and released it under BSD like licence .
