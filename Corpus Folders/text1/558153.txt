" <p> " Its been two weeks since the invoice was due ; I should definitely say something now. - So , how- do I- phrase this nicely ? " <p> You 're not alone . In 2012 , the Wall Street Journal reported that around 64% of small businesses have invoices that go unpaid for 60 days or more , and 14% of small business owners said that late payments are their biggest business challenge . <p> If it were easy to chase payments , then overdue invoices would n't be such a challenge . Its painful , awkward , - and more importantly Its bad for business . <p> But why ? - And how can we make it easier for ourselves ? <p> Even better , how can we sidestep the problem entirely and not have to chase payments ? <h> Why Chasing Payments- is Bad for Business <p> The one upside to following up on invoices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downsides make it a painful ordeal . here 's how : <h> It cheapens the relationship into a transaction . <p> The best relationships between companies and customers are more than just about money ; they have- mutual trust , respect , and other warm and fuzzy feelings . That takes years to build up . For example , think of a- relationship between an accountant and their customer of 10 years . <p> On the other end of the spectrum are transactional relationships , like the one you have when you exchange $1 for a- bottle of water . That relationship- is nothing more than : I 'm giving you a dollar so give me a bottle of water . Its cheap , cold , and its easy to end . <p> Repeatedly asking for money degrades the relationship into a transaction , potentially washing away all the warm and fuzzy feelings the customer built up towards you . <h> It can seem- pushy . <p> Nobody likes being pushed around , even when they 're wrong . <h> It can make you look- desperate . <p> People will wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> It causes resentment . <p> A customer can misinterpret your invoice follow-up as a sign of distrust , causing resentment towards you . <p> For example , one time I- received- a nasty email from a customers accounts payable department in reply to my invoice reminder . It was something like : <p> " We know how to run our business and we always pay invoices . We do n't  need a reminder from you ! " <p> Unfortunately they thought my- invoice reminder was implying that they 're unreliable , and werent happy about that . <p> How many other customers think this way but never mention it . <h> Its one more thing to think about . <p> Its one more thing you must keep in mind and remember to do . Actually several things , if you have to follow-up on the invoice multiple- times . <h> Its a waste of time and productivity . <p> You- might- think its not a big deal to write a short email and send it off , but it becomes a huge waste of time when you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can take as long as 30 minutes to get back into focus after an interruption. - So interrupting your day to send a few " short " reminders- can easily cost you more than 30 minutes of productivity . <h> How to Make It Less Painful <p> We know chasing payments suck , - but what can we do about it ? If you must follow up on past-due invoices , there are some ways you can make it less painful for everyone involved : <h> Automate reminders and follow-ups . <p> Schedule automatic reminders for upcoming invoices and follow-ups for past-due invoices . This will take them off your mind and will ensure they always go out on time , exactly as you planned them. - Many accounting- and invoicing tools " such as QuickBooks , FreshBooks , and Xero " have options to schedule and customize email reminders . <h> Let the system take the blame . <p> If you automate the invoice reminder and follow-up emails , make it clear that the emails are generated and sent by the system . This way any bad feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the software , not at you . <p> Use an email template written in third person to make it an obvious system message . For example : <p> " Automatic reminder : Your invoice #1483 from Acme Corp is past due . " <h> Let someone else take the blame . <p> Have another person , such as a- colleague or accountant , send the reminders . Any bad feelings from the reminders would be directed at them , keeping your relationship with the customer in good shape . <h> Treat it as no big deal . <p> Its only awkward if you make it awkward , right ? Its difficult to misinterpret a friendly one-line message like " Hey , resurfacing this ! " or " Hey , friendly reminder about the invoice ! " <h> Give Benefit of the Doubt <p> If you assume the customer is intentionally delaying payment or is doing anything malicious , it will come across in your communication , making your customer defensive. - Instead , treat the overdue invoice as- an innocent mistake . <p> Maybe the invoice notification got buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with emails . Maybe they 're having a very busy week and are letting things slip through the cracks . <p> Havent we all been there ? <p> here 's how you can remind customers about invoices without putting them on the defensive : <p> " Hey John , I know its the end of the month and your inbox must be flooded , so I 'm re-sending the invoice in case it got buried the first time . " <p> Or : <p> " Hey John , I know the automatic invoice emails- from QuickBooks can go to spam or never reach the recipient , so I 'm sending a copy in case the first one never reached you . " <p> People are more likely to comply if they 're treated fairly . Even more so if they- realize- they 're being treated better- than they deserve ! <h> Express gratitude . <p> To prevent- the relationship from taking a nosedive into transactional- territory ( as explained earlier ) , remind the customer that this is n't all about money ; you 're grateful for the opportunity to work together , you find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ! <h> Use the phone . <p> Make a friendly phone call before or after sending the invoice follow-up . Emails are easy to misread , especially if the reader is having a bad day . A short call or voicemail goes a long way in preventing any misunderstandings about the tone of an email . <h> Even Better : - Stop Chasing Payments <p> What 's better than knowing how to fix a problem ? Avoid it altogether ! <p> Heres- how- you can ensure you never have to follow up with customers about overdue invoices again : <h> Request payment up front . <p> Getting the billing over with in the beginning will prevent any invoice issues down the road . Consider using temporary authorizations on credit cards if your payment system allows it . <h> Get payment information ahead of time . <p> If you can collect credit card or bank details up front , then you can- charge the customer on a pre-determined date with no delays . <p> Note : - Storing credit card numbers and bank account information opens you up to liability risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of- storing that information that meet certain security standards ( also known as PCI compliance ) . <h> Schedule automatic payments . <p> There are tools- available " such as ChargeOver " that not only generate and send invoices for you , but also securely store payment information and charge the customer on a custom schedule . Then your invoices will always be paid on time and you 'll never have to- chase payments again . Some of those tools also integrate with Quickbooks and other accounting tools to keep your bookkeeping up to date . <p> Chasing payments is one of the most frustrating and stressful things about running a business . Many of- us just accept it as a fact of life , but it is n't . <p> With some adjustments to how you follow-up on overdue invoices or to- the tools you use , you can forget about chasing payments and get back to running your business . 
@@90467746 @5967746/ <h> Curing the Cash-Flow Stress of Marketing Agency Owners <p> Cash flow is the bane of nearly every marketing agency owner . One survey shows that two thirds of marketing agency owners consider unpredictable cash flow one of their top three challenges , and 19% of them called it their top concern . <p> That 's not to say they do n't  face other challenges , but at least they can allocate resources months ahead of time with confidence , focus on long-term projects , and increase their monthly recurring revenue with every new customer they sign on . <p> Why are marketing agencies especially vulnerable to this challenge ? Because they sell projects , not monthly services , and therefore must deal with the effects : <p> Some months you sell more projects than others . <p> Some projects go stale before reaching a payment milestone . <p> Some clients need to be reminded of past-due invoices . <p> And even the best projects have to end at some point , ending their tenure as a source of revenue . <p> All of which leads to irregular revenue that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But that 's just the nature of marketing agency work and there 's no way around it . There is no recurring revenue for a marketing agency . Right ? <p> Certainly , many agency owners seem to think so . They accept this " reality " and rely solely on selling enough one-off projects consistently to survive . <p> That 's wrong . <p> Marketing agencies can earn predictable , recurring revenue , and enjoy all the benefits that come with it : <p> Ability to better plan resources , budgets , and internal projects for next month , quarter , and year . <p> Build a full-time team that grows with the company , rather than having to call in different contractors for short durations . <p> Less stress about the future . <p> How can marketing agencies achieve this dream world of steady cash flow ?

The vendors credibility with us was shattered . <p> Of course , offering an annual plan has great benefits . ( See this excellent article- from Andrew Tate- for more on that . ) But blindly funneling prospects into plans that are the best for your company- and not for your customers is the worst plan ever . <h> You Wont Believe What This SaaS Did #2 <p> A SaaS had been providing us with a metrics service for a few months , and it was working just fine .

@@90467820 @5967820/ <h> You Wont Believe What This SaaS Did <p> Recently we encountered a few SaaS companies that exhibited what we consider to be bad SaaS behavior . <p> Doubts crept in . As painful as it is to admit , were not always right . Perhaps were just easily offended . Why would a SaaS operate in a manner so counter to driving growth ? <p> So we consulted the interwebs and its collection of SaaS-related content for a second opinion . While not all of the over 5,000 SaaS " influencers " are like SaaS savant- Lincoln Murphy or the wizards at- Price Intelligently , not one recommends the practices we share with you here . <p> Just say no to bad SaaS behavior . <h> You Wont Believe What This SaaS Did #1 <p> We clicked on a display ad advertising a popular SaaS-based marketing tool . The landing pages went right for the sale , revealing a " web discount price " that was based on an annual agreement . <p> We hesitated . The expense ( $$$$ , not $$$ ) would n't be insignificant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the software through its paces . Even with a 30-day money back guarantee , a monthly plan would have been a much more reasonable option for our startup company . <p> Later , a team member revisited the products pricing page directly from its homepage . Guess what ? Both annual and monthly plans were offered . <p> As you might imagine , we chose another product . The vendors credibility with us was shattered . <p> Of course , offering an annual plan has great benefits . ( See this excellent article- from Andrew Tate- for more on that . ) But blindly funneling prospects into plans that are the best for your company- and not for your customers is the worst plan ever . <h> You Wont Believe What This SaaS Did #2 <p> A SaaS had been providing us with a metrics service for a few months , and it was working just fine . Then one of our long-term service providers began to offer that same service as part of an existing package for no additional fee . Oh , happy day ! <p> Canceling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Do we need to form a coalition ? <p> We searched the services website . Eventually , we found the cancelation link ; it was on our account statement page . <p> The messaging we found there ( shown in the image with identifiers redacted ) is n't what wed expect from this company . <p> Few companies could pull this off . What matters most is consistency in voice . <p> Notice how the first few paragraphs on the statement are calm , customer centric , and lack irony ? That 's how every communication from this company has been up until this point : entirely helpful and pleasant . <p> Marking the beginning of the end of a customers experience with something like this guilt-inducing zinger , " if you still really want to bum us out , click here to cancel " instantly weakens any goodwill you 've built up with the customer . <p> There are ways to save a churning customer account . This kind of comment is n't one of them . <p> Saving a customer account requires an understanding of why the customer wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had added functionality , making this service redundant . <p> We had been perfectly happy with the service . If asked , we would have happily provided a customer referral . <p> Even when a SaaS customer is canceling , its worth taking the high road . You never know what 's at stake . <p> The world and particularly the SaaS world is a lot smaller than we think . <h> You Wont Believe What This SaaS Did #3 <p> Bad SaaS offender #3 took us by surprise . <p> An effective free trial needs to welcome a customer into the SaaS experience . That 's why most SaaS companies spend a lot of time measuring and perfecting their onboarding processes . <p> The beginning of this free trial did not feel so welcoming . Heres what greeted us at the top of the screen right after we logged in for the first time . <p> While we appreciate being warned before we lose data , warning us before we have any data to lose is off-putting . <p> Nearly all SaaS trials have time limits , and keeping prospects aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something to test . You do n't  need to test being friendly , assuming that the sales is a done deal , and threatening customers with data loss . Please , just do n't  . <p> That concludes the bad SaaS behavior we have to share with you in this post . If you see any in you own travels through the Interwebs , please send it our way : were planning a part II for this post . <p> Not sure how to handle a customer message or policy ? That 's easy : treat customers as you would treat yourself .

@@90467872 @5967872/ <p> For Keith , Ryan , and 152 other developers , this years QuickBooks Hackathon was an- opportunity to build something awesome , to spend 30+ hours communing with code , to drink way too much caffeine , and come up with something great for the Intuit App Center . <h> And So It Begins . <p> The next step ? Figuring out what app to create . The first of the caffeinated beverages were consumed as notes were taken and retaken , and wireframes were sketched . <p> A group of accountants stopped in to answer questions and help " gut check " the things that were being built . <p> And then it was heads down to code . Code . Code . Code . Code . Repeat . <h> Truth . <p> Hackathons are n't  torture , actually , and the QuickBooks Hackathon was a blast . For the 30+ hours the team was working , few moments passed by without something awesome happening . <p> Team ChargeOvers pitch went well . They explained that many small businesses would benefit from selling on-line , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way is how difficult it can be to enable e-commerce on a website . The app that Keith and Ryan built makes short work of that hurdle , transforming basic websites into e-commerce sites in just minutes . <h> Win It ? <p> The next day , after a few hours of conference presentations and networking , Scott Cook announced the hackathons winners . <p> The ChargeOver team was thrilled to be named the prize winner in " create a new app category . " The competition had been tough from the beginning . <p> The real win ? Creating something that small business owners need . <h> Now Theres an App for That <p> Ryan and Keith built a nifty app called " Checkout . " Its the best way for a QuickBooks small business to start selling online . A process that used to take days now takes minutes . <h> here 's how to work with Checkout . <p> Checkout then creates two simple assets for marketing your new e-commerce program . <p> A direct link to the sales checkout page which can be shared anywhere <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your website or newsletter <p> And that 's how Checkout works ! Well be talking to more small business users and beginning a full build shortly . As you can imagine , a product created during a hackathon is n't quite ready for an app store . <p> Want to make sure you do n't  miss an update on Checkout ? Follow us on- Twitter . <p> Thank you to their team members and the staff from- @AngelHack- for making the Hackathon a great day . And night . And another day .

@@90467941 @5967941/ <h> Tech dive into the ChargeOver REST API for metered / usage billing <p> SaaS businesses and utility companies are typical users of metered billing . Metered billing has significant advantages for businesses and their customers . Customers can economize by paying only for what they need . At the same time , SaaS and other businesses can compete in crowded marketplaces with flexible offerings that are lower in cost and pay-as-you-go . <h> If you 're a techie and need an automated way to charge per gigabyte , per minute , per user , or per hour , this article is for you . <p> Since you already know what you need , let 's just skip to the good part : the making things work part . <h> What are we going to build ? <p> Were going to- build a simple but powerful integration between an external service and ChargeOver for metered billing. - <p> The external application could be your website or application . It will send metered data to ChargeOver via the- ChargeOver REST API . Here for an example well use the minutes spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> ChargeOver will then generate invoices based on the metered data . The VOIP in our example charges customers $.05/minute for plus a $10 monthly fee . <p> In this article , were focusing on the- REST API , but you can send metered data to ChargeOver through- usage URLs- and even spreadsheets . ( Look for another post coming up where well walk through usage URLs. ) - <h> Let 's get started ! <p> First , we need to set up the- VoIP Service in ChargeOver . In ChargeOver , go to Configuration , and then to Services &amp; Products on the left-side menu . You 're going to need to set a few things up so that ChargeOver knows what to charge ( $0.05 per minute ) and to charge based on the metered usage data were going to send in via the REST API . You can name the service whatever you 'd like , but make sure you turn on the usage data/metered billing option . <p> Were going to use Unit Pricing for our example Unit Pricing let 's us ( optionally ) charge a base fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were still going to charge them a base flat fee ) on top of a per-unit price ( $0.05 per minute ) . If we wanted to , Unit Pricing also allows us to use tiers based on the amount of usage for example , we could charge $0.05 per minute for the first 100 minutes , and then $0.04 per minute for the next 500 minutes , etc. - Well keep in simple for this example and just use a single tier at $0.05 per minute . <p> You only have to configure this VoIP service once then you can re-use this for every one of your customers . Let 's set up the customer and the recurring package/subscription next ! <p> Create your Recurring Package and plop the new VoIP service you created onto the package . The recurring package is essentially a template for how to generate invoices ( and recurring payments ) for a customer each month ( or week , or quarter , or etc. if you do n't  bill monthly ) . <p> The recurring package will give you a summary of what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We grabbed our REST API credentials from the ChargeOver Configuration &gt; API &amp; Web Hooks menu , and are going to make our first REST API call to fetch some details about this package from the API . ( Hint : Our open-source code libs on GitHub make it easy to get started with the API ) . here 's the endpoint were going to hit : <p> GET /api/v3/package/713 <p> You 're going to get back a JSON document that looks something like this : <p> The key element here is the lineitemid value ( in this example , 854 ) . This is a globally unique identifier for the particular line on the package/subscription . This is what were going to send our metered data to . Let 's send some metered data to ChargeOver our customer used 22 minutes on September 15 : <p> Pretty straightforward , right ? You 'll send the lineitemid we got from the package , a usagevalue ( the number of minutes used ) and a date range ( for our example , were going to send the total minutes for a full days worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ChargeOver , and click the little chart/graph icon on the package line , you 'll get a pretty graph showing you the data that was submitted to ChargeOver ( the example image below shows a few days worth of data ) . <h> Wait Its that easy to automate my metered billing ? ! <p> That 's right , that 's it . At this point , youve successfully sent usage/metered data to ChargeOver , and ChargeOver is going to use that metered data to create an invoice automatically the next time an invoice is due for this customer . The customer will get a nicely formatted email invoice , and a copy of the invoice in PDF format , that will indicate the minutes they were billed for based on the unit pricing tiers you set up . <p> here 's an example of what the invoice is going to look like : <p> Notice the flat fee ( $10 ) that were charging , and then the second line item for the $0.05 per minute charge ( 361 minutes ) . <p> From a technical perspective , you can submit usage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once per day , or many times a day , its up to you . ChargeOver will automatically charge for the correct usage based on the invoice date and period for which the customer is being billed . <p> Of course , you can also customize how your PDF invoices look in ChargeOver , how often invoices are generated ( i.e. you can bill monthly , quarterly , weekly , etc. ) and much , much more
