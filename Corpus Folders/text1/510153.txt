However , that is because it occurred in the context of a larger downtrend after a volume crescendo had already occurred a month before : <p> Looking back up at the first chart , you can see that the rally was suspect because the volume had been declining throughout . Larger players were not accumulating shares . ( The purple line on the volume chart is a five-hour moving average ) . <p> The third panel on the first chart shows a moving average of NYSE breadth , which I like for identifying overbought/oversold conditions . On June 21st , the market had made a recent overbought peak and breadth had begun to deteriorate . So , there was reason to suspect the gap . <p> Now look at the red " x " on the first chart marking the June 14 , 2010 gap .

@@88484305 @3984305/ <h> Jesuits vs . Illuminati The American Power Struggle <p> Libertarians and conspiracy buffs like to say that there is no difference between the Republicans and Democrats . That both right and left are only sock puppets deployed by one grand conspiracy to effect an Hegelian Dialectic to dupe the masses during the march toward global totalitarian dictatorship . However , this view just does n't  hold water . <p> I think it makes much more sense to view todays political divisions as the continuation of the primary ideological schism of Western civilization : the long and bloody battle between Catholics and Protestants . For centuries , the Catholic church was The Man , and the Protestants were the original protestors , hence their name . The Jesuits were created and deployed as " Gods Marines " to beat back the protestors , which they did indeed do . <p> Then Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati to recruit allies in his own personal vendetta with the Jesuits at the University of Ingolstadt . The Illuminati quickly became the vanguard of the Protestant battle against the Church . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted that power for himself . So he modeled his organization on the Jesuits , and both became different flavors of the same thing : authoritarian power organizations bent on global dominance . Hence the illusion that they are factions of the same conspiracy . <p> The Illuminati even copied the architecture of the Church . In the first nation that they seized control of , the USA , they reproduced the Womb-and-Phallic Symbol motif of Saint Peters Square in Vatican City : <p> There is pretty good evidence that the Illuminati set-up at Yale University as Skull and Bones . Yale was the Protestant flagship school of the Ivy League . As late as 1970 , they had rules to ensure a Protestant ( WASP elite ) student body . <p> The Jesuit flagship university is Georgetown in Washington D.C. , which is famous for training Americas diplomats . That 's where Democrat Bill Clinton got his Foreign Service degree . One of the most-celebrated events of Deep Politics is when Clinton mentioned his professor , Carroll Quigley , in 1992 during his presidential nomination speech . Conspiracy buffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-American , Protestant , Skull &amp; Bones cabal in his book , Tragedy &amp; Hope . What did it mean ? Clinton was just tweaking his Bonesman opponent , George H. W. Bush . <p> Was Quigley a Vatican agent publishing dirt on the Illuminati enemy ? Maybe . In Tragedy and Hope , a gigantic book , the word " Jesuit " appears exactly one time , on page 1,038 and it is a favorable mention : <p> " The large number of Catholic mens colleges in the country , especially those operated by the Jesuits , had as their basic , if often unrecognized , aim the desire to transform the sons of working class , and often of immigrant , origins into middle-class people in professional occupations ( chiefly law , medicine , business , and teaching ) . " <p> But it looks to me like the Jesuits do the exact opposite : run expensive private schools that cater to rich kids . In any case , surely the Jesuits played a larger historical role than Quigley would have us believe . <p> Speaking of Bonesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA , and the CIA , having recruited numerous Bonesmen , is the ultimate expression of Adam Weishaupts Illuminati : a secret society with virtually unlimited resources and power . After World War II , the CIA infiltrated and superseded the Pentagon . The Bay of Pigs , the Vietnam War , Central American death squads , etc. were all CIA projects , and the CIA is still actively trying to take over the world . Weishaupt would be proud . <p> The Catholic/Protestant conflict has been more of a rivalry than a war in the USA , but there have been violent incidents . For example , in 1834 , a Protestant mob burned down a Catholic convent near Boston during the Ursuline Convent Riots . <p> Quite a lot of violence occurred in the 1980s when CIA-trained death-squads in Central America killed Catholic priests and nuns . The most egregious incident was probably the November 1989 massacre of six Jesuits , their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador . The CIA knew about the attack , and did n't  warn the Jesuits , maybe because the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of revenge when their Christic Institute broke the Iran-Contra scandal . While the Illuminati is far more powerful than the Jesuits today , the Jesuits can still be quite the thorn in the side . <p> This theory explains the divide between the USA and South America . In the 1700s , the Jesuits were running large operations ( " reductions " ) in South America , leaving North America open to Illuminati designs . The CIA has campaigned extensively in the Jesuit turf south of the border , but with mixed results , and recently losing ground to the Pink Tide . <p> Much of what the CIA does is to make the world safe for Rockefeller Oil and the Rockefeller Bank . And in Manhattan , we see the church and the Illuminati glaring at each other across 5th Avenue . On one side is Saint Patricks Cathedral , and on the other is Rockefeller Center . The Illuminati deploys a sculpture of Atlas , which resembles Fascist dictator Mussolini . The sculpture also brings to mind the rabid atheist , Ayn Rand , whose book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street probably fantasize about blowing it up : <p> Atlas sculpture at Rockefeller Center across the street from Saint Patricks Cathedral in Manhattan ( from Wikipedia . ) <p> So on one side , we have the Republican , fascist , right wing , conservative , capitalist Illuminati . And on the other , we have the Democratic , communist , left wing , liberal , socialist Church . The Fascists like to persecute poor people . The Communists like to persecute rich people . The Fascists would destroy the world with a rapacious , slaving , robber-baron , monopolistic economy . The Jesuits would destroy the world with an incompetent , backward , chaos of collapsing communism . <p> Take your pick . <p> Both sides relish their turn at the controls of an increasingly authoritarian system . And indeed , both work to extend the system . For example , Viet D. Dinh , who wrote the Patriot Act for George W.

As a burgeoning empire , perhaps the official history if the USA had to be punched-up a bit . After all , the colonists werent exactly wild about the idea of a revolution , and General Washington had to spend half of his time begging for money .

How could it be that I was never forced to read such a famous book ? Well , I have a theory now : its possible that the book was deemed to be " too gay " for us suburban students . I just finished reading it , and here are some quotes . <p> At the beginning of the book , before the Pequod sets sail , the main character , Ishmael , is looking for a hotel . But all the hotels are full , and his only option is to share a room with Queequeg , the savage harpooner . The room has one large bed and no heat , so they have to snuggle together for warmth . There is no explicit sex , but there is a lot narrative like this : <p> " We had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we " ( Kindle 1082 ) <p> And this : <p> " As we were going along the people stared ; not at Queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets , but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms . But we heeded them not " ( Kindle 1148 ) <p> And this : <p> " How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends . Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning . Thus , then , in our hearts honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg a cosy , loving pair . " ( Kindle 1079 ) <p> After the Pequod leaves port , the love affair seems to come to an end , and the narrative turns to whaling , as you can imagine . <p> For some reason , sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . At first , people thought it was sperm , but that turned out to be wrong . Its just some kind of mysterious oil . So , the word " sperm " in the context of whaling means the same thing as " whale oil . " Hence the quote at the top of the page ( Kindle 3519 ) ; the sailors are excited by sperm because it is a valuable commodity , and they are rowing , pulling hard , to catch up with the whale . <p> Melville also uses the word " erect " quite a lot : <p> " The savage stood erect there " ( Kindle 3540 ) <p> " erecting himself " ( Kindle 3548 ) <p> " an erect posture " ( Kindle 3554 ) <p> " erect attitude " ( Kindle 3565 ) <p> " erected crests of enraged serpents " ( Kindle 3609 ) <p> " the body was erect " ( Kindle 3763 ) <p> " Of erections , how few are domed like St. Peters !

You might think that a whale could just dive down and evade the whalers , but whales are mammals and have to come up for air . So , the whalers would just wait them out . A whaling ship did n't  chase whales itself , but put smaller boats in the water that had oars , as well as sails . That way they were not dependent on the wind . Sometimes they could row as fast as the whale could swim ; sometimes not . While they had muskets , they did n't  shoot whales because they might just sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rope attached to the harpoon so that you cold reel them in . And for that , you had to get up close and personal , which as you can imagine , was quite dangerous , especially considering that the whales did n't  appreciate being harpooned . You might think that a harpooned whale could just pull a boat under , or drag it around for weeks . But apparently , they bleed out from even the small wounds made by harpoons , so they are more vulnerable than they look . <p> Note : I loaded the Project Gutenberg version of Moby Dick onto my Kindle and read it there .

Of course , if you can not turn your head far enough to see where you are going when backing your car out of a parking space , it could become very serious indeed for somebody walking behind you . <p> Sub-clinical conditions are a hobby of mine . When you have something as complicated as the human body , and no research being done on a condition , you have a good mystery to solve . <p> One day in February 2008 , I woke up with intense pain in my upper back , between my shoulder blades .

I used the antacid because everything I had in the house was acidic , which is how I got into this condition in the first place , of course . <p> There are many reasons to " eat your greens " , but probably the most over-looked one is that they help you maintain your acid/alkaline balance . Staying in balance is crucial to health and probably why the folk remedy of using fresh fruit to cure the cold , flu , etc. works so well .

The very idea of " sleeping injuries " seems ridiculous to me . Yes , you can sleep on your arm and cut off the circulation , but do we really need to work on our sleeping skills to avoid injury in this " dangerous " activity ? I do n't  think so . Rather , I think that while you are sleeping , you are not eating anything that your body can use to reduce acidity , so that is a prime time for your muscles to stiffen up . I have also had this pain strike me during the day , so I 'm certain that it has nothing to do with sleep itself . <p> I am no biochemist , but it appears that your body can use calcium to reduce the acidity of your blood .

I had some juice with every meal , and ate a couple of pieces of fresh fruit each day . It worked , but my weight started to go up from all those extra carbohydrates . Then I noticed that lemons were at the top of the alkaline-foods list , so I ditched the juice and started putting lemon juice in my drinks . It worked beautifully . <p> While I was googling around researching this , I found several good clues , but nobody who had put them all together as I have done here .

Only use antacid in an emergency . <p> This , of course , is not professional medical advice .

Or that you need a music professor standing next to you on the dance floor guiding your every move . If all you want to do is dance , this is the guide for you . It is completely free of musical jargon and was written for dance students learning salsa , not musicians . <p> What you have to do to stay on the rhythm is simple : Count one-through-eight over and over . The hard part is starting in the right place and going at the right speed . The Salsa Rhythm Machine will take you most of the way , but you cant bring your computer out onto the dance floor , right ? So , in addition to using the software , you will want to use our learning method whenever you are listening to salsa music such as when you are in your car , a salsa class , or a club . <p> Step 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like learning turns/steps does . It is something that you have to do yourself . It wo n't happen by magic , and no instructor can simply put it into you .

If you do n't  drive , spend a half an hour a day listening to the music while not doing anything else . <p> Step 2 Start With Easy Music <p> When it comes to being able to hear the rhythm , salsa music ranges from easy to insanely difficult . See our Easy Songs page for song ratings . <p> Step 3 Stop Listening to the Melodies <p> Do n't  sing along , and do n't  hum along with the horn section .

Usually when you first hear a pop song , such as Ricky Martins " Livin La Vida Loca " , it takes a few times before you start to like it . Depending on how repetitious the song is , it might take five , six , seven or more times before you learn the melodies .

You may also find that a little bit of alcohol will help you feel the music . <p> Step 5 Count 1 through 8 <p> There are always eight counts in salsa music . You dance three steps and pause , then three more and pause , for a total of eight counts . Different instructors count different ways . Some count , 1-2-3-pause-5-6-7-pause , or 1-2-3-pause-1-2-3-pause , etc . It does n't  make any difference how you count while you are dancing or if you count at all . But when you are learning how to hear the rhythm , it is important to count one through eight because the musicians will be playing eight counts and you are trying to get in sync with them .

The taps should be equally spread apart . Think of a rowing team where there is a guy in the back of the boat beating the drum so that the rowers can all stay together . That 's the rhythm , and that 's you playing it . Now imagine that the rowers are singing a song to relieve the boredom . They will not row to the song they are singing , but will still follow the drummer . So as the drummer , you have to ignore whatever the rowers are singing and keep beating the drum steadily . You want your finger to move like a metronome , which is the thing you sometimes see in movies that makes ticking sounds during a piano-lesson scene . Musicians do n't  practice enough with metronomes any more and consequently have to rely heavily on computers and lip-synching . But we cant do that while we are dancing , right ?

Make sure to say the numbers robotically just as your finger taps . <p> Step 8 Do n't  Focus on any Particular Instrument <p> Do n't  listen to any one instrument . Try to just feel the music in general . There will not be one instrument playing a steady eight counts throughout the song . Sometimes there will be nothing to listen to at all like when the band is silent for a few seconds and then starts back up . You have to keep up a steady count just like they do . ( That 's how they can all suddenly resume playing at the exact right time . ) The first mistake you will make is to tap your finger to the rhythm of an individual instrument . That will usually have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . However , the musicians and singers will all play within the rhythm . So if there is a piano solo going on , the rhythm will be there and you should try to look for it . <p> Step 9 Listen for " The One " <p> Usually , but not always , the singers and musicians will emphasize The One " that is , they will bang the drum a little harder , blow the trumpet a little louder , raise their voices , etc . They will also usually , but not always , " come in " on the one . So if there is a trumpet solo , the trumpet player will often start playing on The One , or the background singers will join in on the one . Often , there will be a BAM ! where the whole band emphasizes The One in a serious manner . Listen for those . While you should not be following the melodies , you can often use the melodies to find The One . Suppose that a piano is playing a melody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight counts , and then repeat the melody starting on the next One . Or if the background singers are singing the same thing over and over , they will usually start on The One and then repeat the lyrics on the next One , and the next , etc . But not always . Sometimes they will come in on the 7 and then repeat their lyrics on subsequent 7s . So you should only use this method when you cant find The One by other means . And you should definitely not use the melodies while dancing . <p> Step 10 Adjust the Speed of Your Tapping <p> Speed up or slow down your tapping to try and match it to the music . When you think you hear The One , start counting and see if you can rotate around in time to the next One . <p> Step 11 Keep Your Body Still <p> Do n't  move any other parts of your body such as tapping your foot . You are learning to play an instrument here : the rhythm finger . So , you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Simplest Turn Over and Over <p> Once you can follow along by tapping your finger , try dancing with the simplest turn you know . You should take your first step on The One , and of course , pause on the 4 and 8 . Repeat that one turn over and over for the whole song . <p> Step 13 Feel the Difference <p> The way to tell that you are on the rhythm is that you will be able to feel the difference . You will experience a noticeable increase in fun , joyful , exhilarating feelings because you are in harmony with the band . <p> Step 14 Validate With an Instructor <p> Take a private lesson with a dance instructor and have them test you . Bring your CD and have the instructor put on the song you find easiest . If the instructor counts out loud one through eight , or makes sound affects like : " bop , bop , bop , pause , bop , bop , bop , pause , " to emphasize the rhythm , ask them to remain silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instructors will also usually help you to find The One at the beginning of the song by starting to move or lean as it approaches . Ask them to remain still and then tell you whether or not you started on The One . Instructors are used to giving commands and are often headstrong , so be prepared to assert yourself on these points . <p> Step 15 Stop Advancing Through Rueda Levels <p> If you are going to rueda classes , remain at your current level until you get your rhythm working . Learning rhythm is easiest when you are doing turns you already know thoroughly . You can tell you are improving when you become able to distinguish which of your partners have better or worse rhythm than you do . As you improve , stop looking at the instructor or other students and see if you can stay on the rhythm by just listening to the music . So when the instructor calls : " Suena ! " you can stomp your foot at the right time without looking at anybody elses foot . <p> Advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Five is usually emphasized like The One , though to a lesser degree . This is a good thing because you can check your timing twice during the count . But this confuses many dancers who have been trained to count one-through-four instead of one-through-eight . They cant tell the difference between The One and The Five . While they can stay on the rhythm , they never know if they are dancing on The One or The Five . That 's better than being off the rhythm , but it feels very , very wrong once you know how to stay on The One . <p> Some instructors do n't  care whether or not they are starting on The One or The Five . Being able to distinguish what count your instructor is starting on is another milestone for you . Also , if you are following , you may notice that your partner is starting on The Five . If you are leading , you may sometimes experience trouble getting in sync with your partner at the beginning of the song . You may be trying to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Five . Tell her that it is easier if she waits for you to start . <p> Five-to-One Shifts <p> Once you can tap your finger to the rhythm , you will often find yourself mysteriously off the count , starting on The Five instead of The One . This happens because sometimes the band will only play four counts instead of eight . What would normally be The Five , becomes the The One and then the song continues on for the normal cycles of eight . So , the count will go 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 instead of 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1-2-3-4 The Salsa Rhythm Machine will show you examples of this . In Rocket Babys Bumble Bee Salsa ! , included with The Salsa Rhythm Machine , there is such a shift 15 seconds into the song . To spot one on your own , pay attention to the beginning of the song when the vocals begin . You will find that pretty much all dancers ignore these shifts . While it feels funny to break on The Five instead of The One , ( or The Six instead of The Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torres is said to teach a " hot step " half-turn to handle these shifts . Other instructors who teach the Torres style may also teach the hot step . One such school is D.Vice Latin Dance Studio in North Miami . If you know of a description or video of the hot step on the web , please send me the link . <p> However , we feel there should be some sort of " half turn " you can do to get back onto The One . If you know of such a technique , please email us . <p> Speed Shifts <p> Speed shifts are relatively easy to handle . Songs do n't  normally drastically increase or decrease their speed . Usually they only change by a few beats per minute . While dancing to an unfamiliar song , just be alert and ready to speed up or slow down . A good place to look for speed changes is when instruments start , or stop playing . For example , when the horns come in , the song will often speed up to increase the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often start out slow , then speed up , then slow down a little at the end . <p> Rhythm Pauses <p> Rhythm pauses happen when the part of the band that is playing the rhythm pauses while the part that is playing the melody continues . There is a one-beat pause 62 seconds into Salsa #5 , which The Salsa Rhythm Machine will point out for you . These pauses are hard to detect , and normally you must learn where they are in each song to pause at the correct time . So , just like speed changes , you have to be alert to the fact that a pause can throw you off . Check yourself on each One count , and if you feel you are early , slow down a bit until you feel like you are back on track . <p> Intros and Outros <p> That 's the beginning and ending of songs . Quite often , there is no salsa rhythm during these phases , so do n't  be concerned . At the beginning of a song , you usually have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you often have to stop dancing before the song ends because the rhythm has disappeared . That will happen a lot with live bands . DJs will usually " blend beats " and speed up or slow down the next song so that it matches the previous one in order to " keep the party going . " So , if all of a sudden you hear some weird , distorted music , that is the DJ doing one of his " cool " DJ moves . <p> Distorted and Obscure Music <p> DJs , and some bands , will often turn up the volume until the music is horribly distorted . You would think that such people would have an ear for such things , but maybe some people simply can not hear distortion . So a song that you have practiced with a lot at home , may sound totally different in a club , but usually you can follow the rhythm since the bass is almost always turned up very high . But if you go to a school where the music is always very loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played at home on a stereo . In that case , it is important to practice an equal amount of time with non-distorted music so that you do n't  become conditioned to it . <p> DJs like to prove how cool they are by playing music that most people do n't  know . In fact , this is how MTV management used to know when they needed to reign-in their VJs . When the VJs started talking about how hip the station was , MTV would know that they needed to change the play-list . If they let the VJs make the station " too hip for the room " , they would lose their mainstream audiance . So , often a DJ will play something that sounds completely bizarre to you . Sit these songs out until the DJ gets it out of his system and gets back to playing something danceable . Do n't  be the victim of an egotistical DJ ! 
@@88484320 @3984320/ <h> New World Order Propaganda in Marvels Agents of SHIELD <p> Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D . is a superhero TV show about a United Nations espionage agency and is associated with The Avengers . It began its second season last night on ABC , and is a pretty good show with good special effects . SHIELD is produced by Disney , which as you know from reading my book is The Evilest Place on Earth , and anything it puts out should be scrutinized for propaganda content . <p> This essay contains moderate spoilers . I do n't  mention the biggest mysteries of the series : Coulsons Tahiti project , who Skyes parents are , or who the Hydra traitors are . Also , studies have shown that people enjoy stories more when they know the ending in advance . So , quit being a baby . = <p> Villain in episode #2 ( 29:55 ) as her crucifix catches the light . <p> You might think that a global CIA/FBI type of organization like SHIELD would be preoccupied with enemy nations such as Russia , Iran , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently bombing . But no , bizarrely , SHIELD is obsessed with the oh-so sinister nation of Malta a small island south of Sicily . And the other nation presented as explicitly evil is also tiny : Peru . <p> What do Malta and Peru have in common ? They are Catholic ; very Catholic . Peru is so Catholic that priests are on the government payroll . Malta is so Catholic that it was once ruled by the Knights of Malta , a Catholic fraternal organization that issues its own passports and stamps , and has observer status at the United Nations . The show has scenes in many other nations , but none other are explicitly designated as evil , or even disparaged in any way . Oddly , the show never mentions any of the worlds major intelligence agencies like the Russian FSB , British MI6 , or the Israeli Mossad . In fact , only the Italian intelligence agency makes an appearance , and they are in league with the bad guys ( episode 13 ) . Italy , of course , is another Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NATO member . And finally , Sicily is disparaged when a SHIELD agent telling a story says : " The Sicilian backup team , hah , a no-show of course . " ( Episode 17 at 41:45 ) . <p> Why would SHIELD be persecuting Catholics ? See my " Jesuits vs . Illuminati " The American Power Struggle " for an explanation . There are very few religious themes in the series . In episode 9 , there is brief discussion of god and hell where we learn that Agent Skye is an atheist . In episode 8 , an alien Asgardian weapon is found in an Irish monastery ( 28:51 ) . When Agent Ward picks it up , it brings out his inner evil and turns him into a berserker . The Catholic crosses in the background associate that evil with the church . All of the religious content of the show is anti-God and anti-Catholic . <p> Message from the NWO : " Catholics stand in the way of our march to global domination . " <p> The very first character we see in episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who becomes a villain . His son has turned his back on him as the boy drools over Avengers action figures in a store window . Mike goes back to the factory that laid him off and roughs up his manager . Later , he is apprehended by SHIELD . <p> Message from the NWO : " If we send your job to China , and flood the country with cheap labor , and you cant afford to buy toys for your children , that 's just tough . Your patriotic duty is to embrace poverty or be imprisoned . Your boy is right to idolize us and not you . Maybe he will grow up to be a TSA agent instead of a stupid factory worker . " <p> Episode #2 is the Peruvian show . Decades ago , Peru commissioned the Nazis to build them some advanced weapons technology , and SHIELD has to disarm them . <p> Message from the NWO : " The Catholic/Latin world was in league with the Nazis . " <p> Yes , many Nazis hid in South America after World War Two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant America where Nazis were brought into the government , and some like Wernher von Braun were given positions of power . <p> Camilla Reyes of the Peruvian Army ( photo above ) captures Agent Coulson and tells him ( at 28:29 ) " You stay in your borders and I 'll stay in mine . " Coulson replies : " Those borders are disappearing . Aliens descended on New York , remember ? They do n't  care whose colors you wear , they just care who 's in the way . We should be working together , not fighting . " But the aliens are long gone , defeated by the Avengers in a feature film . <p> Message from the NWO : " We do n't  recognize your borders , and you might as well just surrender . " <p> Episode #3 is the first Malta show . The agents make a show of agonizing over respecting Maltas sovereignty , but then just invade anyway . The villain , Ian Quinn , is an American who moved to Malta to avoid government regulations . <p> Message from the NWO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haven , we will come for you ! " <p> In real life , champion poker player Isaac Haxton has moved to Malta so that he can play online poker , which casino moguls like Sheldon Adelson have gotten banned in the USA and other nations . Maybe Haxton should watch his back . = <p> Agent Sourpuss never smiles . <p> In episode #9 ( at 29:10 ) we learn why Agent May is so glum . It seems she " accidentally " slaughtered a bunch of people in Bahrain during a Waco-type of situation , and now is filled with remorse . <p> Message from the NWO : " Were terribly sorry for Waco , and we suffer each and every day from terrible guilt and remorse to the point where we are reluctant to slaughter more people . " <p> This theme is similar to the theme from the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty where CIA agent Maya Lambert gets no joy or glory out of tracking down Osama bin Laden . I doubt that the cowboy-types who do these raids feel much remorse . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waco video below where an FBI agent praises a colleague as " honed to kill " : <p> A far cry from the Agents of SHIELD , right ? But who knows , maybe they really are sorry . After all , we have n't had any more mass slaughters since Waco . Our police are militarized , but they are still much more restrained . During Occupy Wall Street , all they did was pepper-spray people , and Cliven Bundy did n't  get so much as a slap on the wrist . <p> The rebel hacktivist character , Skye , is a member of SHIELD nemesis The Rising Tide , whose name is reminiscent of the Pink Tide movement that has rolled back NWO influence in South America , which is Catholic turf ( see my essay linked above ) . <p> In episode 13 , Agent May kills Italian intelligence officer Luca Russo by shooting him in the back . This is significant because SHIELD usually just stuns and captures the bad guys . <p> Masonic temple floor in episode 13 . <p> Also in episode 13 , Agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-and-white Masonic temple floor ( 36:32 ) . The Masons are infamous for having been infiltrated by the Illuminati . So , this is a symbolic ceremony depicting an Illuminati triumph over the Catholics . The bad guy , Ian Quinn is not designated as being Catholic , but his operations are on Catholic turf , and he has the Italian intelligence agency working for him . In episode 8 ( 27:00 ) we learn that an immortal from Asgard was a stone mason on Earth : " I was a mason . I broke rocks for thousands of years . " The character is kind of a bad guy , but still , the subliminal message is : masons are gods . <p> In episode 20 ( 15:40 ) an American general describes a SHIELD base in Canada as being on " North American soil . " This is a little preparatory brainwashing for the forthcoming North American Union an NWO project where the USAs sovereignty will be subsumed in a larger political entity . Also in episode 20 ( 2:08 ) Agent Hill says : " Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US security apparatus is already outsourced , but SHIELD prepares us for even more . While SHIELD wants us to worship a global intelligence agency , they present government agencies as less-competent than defense/security corporations . <p> Agent Coulson , who is more like a therapist , or priest than a secret agent , tends to his flock of agents , and bad guys who he tries to turn into good guys with fatherly advice , patience , and support . Agent Coulsons character itself is the primary element of propaganda in Agents of SHIELD he is the personification of the NWO as they want us to perceive it . He is a likable character , but hardly realistic as a secret agent . <p> The last item is a moderate spoiler , so you can stop reading here if you want . In episode 12 ( 40:00 ) , we learn that the orphan rebel girl of the Rising Tide , Skye , had actually been raised by SHIELD , and agents died to protect her . <p> Message from the NWO : " Even though you silly people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saintly grandfather secretly watching over you and protecting you until you come to your senses and realize that everything that we do is for your benefit . " <p> Update : In seasons two and three , I did n't  notice any blatant propaganda , so they have toned things down quite a bit since season one . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> One thought on " New World Order Propaganda in Marvels Agents of SHIELD " <p> They also inject a lot of obvious leftist propaganda in the show . Season 4 depicts Hydra as a Trump America , right down to the " Make our society great again " line used by a brainwashed Dr. Fitz(Mengele). 
@@88484321 @3984321/ <h> Acidic &amp; Alkaline Foods <p> Below are some tests that I conducted on myself to see if particular foods were acidic or alkaline . I had to do this because if you look around the web you will find a lot of conflicting information on which foods are acidic and which are alkaline . There does n't  seem to be any definitive research on this topic . <p> For example , one source claimed that dried apricots were very alkaline . But when I tested this on myself , my pH dropped from 6.2 before I ate the apricots to 5.6 afterward . And that 's exactly the same result I got when testing Coca Cola , which can burn through metal ! <p> My testing is obviously not scientifically conclusive . Human biochemistry is rather complex , and testing on only one subject can not lead to any firm conclusions . Nevertheless , if this exercise leads me to a more pH-balanced state , then I will consider it a success . <p> I did all of these tests on an empty stomach . After eating the test-food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after the next pH reading . I did n't  so much as chew a piece of gum , or take a sip of water . For foods that required water to cook , such as oatmeal , I used Zephyrhills spring water , which is pretty much neutral . I also drank a minimum amount of the spring water as I was eating some of the foods such as peanut butter . I tested the pH of my urine with pHydrion test strips . A normal human urine pH level is 6.5 to 8.0 . If you drop below 6.0 , then your body will burn up lots of electrolytes to right the balance , and that deficiency will cause your nervous system to malfunction . If your diet is too alkaline , you will know very quickly because you will experience heart burn . <p> Here is a summary of my findings . See below for the specifics on each food . <p> Test# : 4Date : June 24 , 2013Time : 2:10pmLength : 60 minutesFood : Aspartame Equal " Original " Brand 20 Packets.Ingredients : Dextrose with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6.0 .

Result : Alkaline.Notes : Various sources on the web say this water has a pH value of 7.5 . However , my testing showed it to be considerably lower . Of course , it does n't  come from just one spring , and water can become more acidic after it comes out of the ground , etc . The water I used came in a 1 gallon plastic jug . <p> Test# : 9Date : June 28 , 2013Time : 2:00pmLength : 90 minutes.Food : Granny Smith Apples ( 2 ) . pH : Decreased from 7.2 to 6.9 . Result : Acidic.Notes : The color on the test paper did not quite match the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , the color was bluish , and after , it was dark but greenish .

I have gout that reacts in one specific knee . When I had extreme flare-ups several years ago , I changed my diet , dropping coffee and alcohol .

I 've lost the link . But I just found this chart today : LONG ... <p> Hello , very interesting experiment and kudos on the level of documentation for us to read . Now I am not a chemist , biologist , doctor , or nutritionist , and I did note you stated that your results were not conclusive based on the method used to obtain the results . I also noticed when you conducted these tests so my input may be moot , but there is one variable you did n't  address in your dissertation , and that is relativity . In some cases your pH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than average and then noticed a very slight pH rise or fall and then concluded the difference to be the indicator for the pH level of the effect . The issue I take with this is if your pH was 5.8 and you tested 6.0 after eating something , why would you conclude that food to be alkaline ? What if your pH prior to ingesting the food was 7.8 , or 8.0 and then 7.0 after costuming the same food ? Would you have concluded the very same food to be acidic at that point ? My point is when your experiment is n't controlled ( as evidenced by various levels of urine pH prior to ingestion ) you somehow have to account for relativity . Aside from that , I really enjoyed your work ! <p> I have just tested my Granny Smith apple from Asda with a bit of ph yellow paper and put this directly onto the apple , it came out red as acidic , my saliva came out alkaline . I thought I was doing a good thing eating apples but maybe not ! Slightly disappointed : /

I will check with Amibroker . It like the documentation piece you wrote . It is clear and intelligible . Thanks . <p> Hi Matt I read a few of Nichols articles this evening and was very intrigued by his fractal dimension indicator so I was doing serches on Yahoo to see what I might could learn anout fractals and ran across this page and this page is very intriguing as well . I see where something called version 1 of this fractal indicator can be downloaded . Is this offer of version 1 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and use it gratis ? I was hoping this might be the case as I would really like to see if I could n't get a feel as to how such a thing might work but I did n't  want to down load it without asking first . Anyway just curious . Roy <p> Is this Carlos Sevciks algorithm ? I was trying to get him to send me a usable copy of it awhile back , but I was nowhere near the computer geek to get that to work . Ive been experimenting with my Fractal Stock Grapher now for awhile and , while I cant do any proper backtesting with it ( see my post above ) , I must say I am amazed by how well it works . <p> I am finding much of the same things about it that Lee Wenzel above found . It is way better at determining sell points than buy points . Its very good at telling you when a strong trend is running out of fuel . I am combining it with technical methods Ive learned for buys and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be misleading on buy points ( end of range head fakes Lee mentions ) but it tells you how much dynamite there is for a possible climb . Its basically a dynamite gauge . Also , it is blind as to the direction a stock takes after end of range is detected . It can start with a sharp move down , which sends the FDI into a release of energy . But then a reversal by the stock into a big climb simply extends the release of energy by the FDI chart . A trend up or down is all the same to the algo . <p> Nichols uses a different algorithm , and he looks at everything in terms of energy levels . <p> Laurent above asked why not have the algo compute volume on a stock . Volume is so important ( its called the " truth teller " for a move ) you would think it should be crammed in there somehow . But as admin said that 's a 3rd dimension and totally messes with the fractal theory . It looks only at all action between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 dimensions ) . You have to use volume and other good things on your own without the help of the algo . <p> Anyway , I am writing , not to blather about theory , but because I recently got a new computer and am having trouble moving my Fractal Stock Grapher over from my old computer . In my email , I have the serial key that was sent to me back in 2010 . Can I just find that ( or have it resent to my email ) and reactivate the demo ? <p> My grapher keeps saying " unable to retrieve data from Yahoo " . Is there some change or problem with their database ? Ive been having problems with my computer not loading sites and giving me messages like " site unavailable " and so on .

@@88484326 @3984326/ <h> Should You Use a RAD Tool for Your Software Project ? <p> Twenty years ago , there was a mad rush where every company built a website . Today , every company wants to have a mobile app , and apps are a lot more complicated than websites . You can throw up a pretty nice website in a single day with WordPress , but developing an app takes much longer . Consequently , there are millions of civilians faced with the challenge of managing software-development projects a daunting task , even for pros . See : " The Long , Dismal History of Software Project Failure . " And no one is immune . For example , Apples " Copeland " operating-system project is regarded as one of the largest failures in history ( see this ) . <p> In this article I will explain some things about software-development tools that will hopefully make things a bit more clear for the non-professional . So , which tools should you use ? Should you use what the platform vendor gives you ? For example , that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Android . Or should you use a tool provided by a third party , of which there are many choices ? <p> One of the problems with using the " official " tools is that they play second fiddle to the hardware . Once a hardware company invents a new computer , they must then write an operating system for it . So , the tools they develop to do that are naturally low-level , well suited for an engineer writing a display driver , for example . They are n't  optimized for you to write an accounting app for your small business . <p> Another problem is that hardware competitors do n't  cooperate very well . Steve Jobs famously wanted to crush Android . However , just about everybody developing mobile apps wants them to work on both iOS and Android . And so , there is a huge void for third-party toolmakers to fill , and one of the big things that they bring to the table is " RAD " technology . <p> Rapid Application Development ( RAD ) is a style of building software that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodology is a group of tools designed to speed development . In general , this speed is achieved by abstracting away the native development environment of the operating system , and replacing it with a streamlined model that requires less training , and increases programmer productivity . <p> Imagine the iPhone as a beautiful work of art sculpted by the geniuses at Apple . Then the RAD designer comes along and says : " I can fix that " takes out his chisel and starts banging away . As you might imagine , its an ambitious endeavor , and RAD designers are a special kind of genius . <p> RAD tools are often expensive , but they are able to command premium prices because they really do speed up development . RAD tools cant do everything , but for a subset of use-cases , you would be crazy to use anything else . Many people also like to use RAD tools for personal productivity and hobbyist applications because the streamlined development tools let them achieve a " flow state " which is very enjoyable . <p> Let 's take a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be able to draw some conclusions about the kinds of projects for which they are appropriate . <h> The Programming Language <p> First of all , the RAD designer has to invent a new programming language . For example , Apples primary programming language in recent years has been Objective C , and here is what the traditional " Hello World " program looks like in that language : <p> A little more accessible , right ? So , the RAD programming language does a lot of the grunt work for you . This language is often referred to as a Forth Generation Language ( 4GL ) . As you probably know , computers run on binary code , zeros and ones . That 's the first generation language , but its rather laborious for us humans . So , we have something easier called assembly language , the second generation , but that 's still too laborious for most tasks . Consequently , most programming is done in third-generation languages like Objective-C and Java . The code in these languages is run through a thing called a compiler which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . <h> The Framework <p> In addition to the language , the RAD designer must abstract the computers framework . What 's a framework ? Its the built-in software that makes it easier for programmers to build apps . For example , if you want to draw a circle on the screen , you do n't  have to manually switch on the pixels in question . You can just call a thing that does that : DrawCircle ( x , y , r , c ) will draw the circle after you tell it where to start ( x &amp; y ) , how big to make it ( r ) , and what color ( c ) . A framework will contain thousands of such subroutines , and typically the RAD designer will only implement the most important ones , leaving aside the more esoteric . <p> The RAD designer is targeting " applications " programmers as opposed to " systems " programmers . The systems programmers are the engineers at the computer company who code all the system software : compilers , drivers , file systems , frameworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the computer and then write an app to manage their companys payroll . <p> Applications programmers generally do n't  have to use the esoteric functions of their computers . So , that 's why a RAD designer can leave out those functions . But there are indeed high-performance apps like games that need low-level code to push the hardware to its limits . So , most RAD tools are not suited for such apps . However , as hardware gets more and more powerful , more and more applications can be handled by RAD tools . <p> The RAD framework also facilitates cross-platform development . For example , Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for decades , and while their frameworks do pretty much the same things , they are vastly different and require years of study by programmers . But you can cut that learning-curve in half by using a RAD tool that provides you with a single framework and then " cross compiles " for each platform . <h> The Compiler <p> Since the RAD designer invents his own language , he also needs to invent his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about compilers , but in general you want a RAD tool that compiles to 64-bit " native code " and uses the state-of-the-art LLVM compiler . Once a RAD tool adopts LLVM technology , you know that it will be able to support new hardware in the future in a timely fashion . For example , Xojo recently added support for new the Raspberry Pi 2 , a windfall for Xojo developers . <h> The GUI Builder <p> Applications programming almost always involves a Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) , so RAD tools always have a drag-and-drop GUI builder . In the old days , you could adjust the buttons , text fields , and lists on your screen by just dragging them to the right place . But with the modern proliferation of screen sizes , you want a GUI builder that can automatically reposition things . You also want one that uses " native controls " so that your GUI looks like all the other apps on your computer . For example , Java uses its own controls and consequently looks horrible on all computers . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly good program , but its jarring to both Mac and Windows users because of its crazy GUI . So , when you are selecting your RAD tool , take a look at the apps it builds on each platform it supports and make sure that they have a native look-and-feel appropriate to the platform . If you are developing an app for internal use , you may not care about this very much . <h> The Database Engine <p> Most applications need to store data , so most RAD tools have some sort of database facility . Relational databases have been the standard for many years , and these systems are often referred to as SQL , which is the language that you use to talk to them : Structured Query Language . In recent years , a database called SQLite has become popular , so if your RAD tool has that , you will be fine . Of course , your RAD designer needs to do a good job abstracting it like any other part of the system . If you will be working with big data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool to have database " drivers " that can connect to the major database-management systems like Oracle , SQL Server , Sybase , MySQL , etc . <h> Extensibility <p> As you may have noticed , the RAD designers job is a big one . And because he has to get his product to market in a reasonable amount of time , he will very likely leave some gaping holes behind . So , you want a RAD tool that is extendable , with some kind of plugin facility that allows you to plug the holes . For example , a long time ago , I developed a product for a startup company in Silicon Valley using the Omnis RAD tool . Omnis was up to the task and the project came out beautifully , but it took a ridiculous amount of time to import the data from the IT department . The Omnis database was adequate , but super slow at importing . However , Omnis had an extension system that allowed me to write an import routine in the " C " programming language that sped up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extendable , then you should n't use it for anything more than hobbyist projects because it is only a matter of time before you hit a brick wall . <h> Licensing <p> Speaking of OmnisI had to stop using it in the mid 1990s when the Internet arrived to the masses . Omnis required that you purchase a serial number for each copy of your app that you made . Such a model is fine for in-house work , and B2B apps , but completely impossible for shareware . So , I switched to Visual Basic which had no " runtime " fees at all . I have also heard of a " free " cross-platform mobile RAD tool that makes apps for iOS and Android , which is only free until you upload your app to the App Store or the Play Store . Then you get a phone call from the RAD tools sales department demanding thousands of dollars . And they can enforce the demand because your app is integrated with their backend services , which means that they can switch off your app whenever they feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your apps , make sure that you know all the licensing details of the RAD tool before you start building apps with it especially if you will be selling your app to the public . <h> The IDE <p> RAD tools also include another large , complex piece of software called an " Integrated Development Environment . " You do n't  have to worry about the IDE too much if you are hiring a contractor . If you are a programmer , you definitely want to evaluate the capabilities of the IDE because it has such a large impact on your productivity . And if there is no debugger , then its not a RAD tool . <h> Technology State <p> Imagine that you are a RAD designer , and you have been slaving away for years on your awesome RAD tool , abstracting away Apples " Cocoa Touch " framework . You release your product to great fanfare , and then a few months later at " dub-dub " Apple announces that Cocoa Touch has been " deprecated " in favor of a new framework called Coconut . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart sinks because you know that you will have to walk over the hot coals all over again , updating your framework to support Coconut , which will take years . And while you are doing that , all of your customers will be complaining that their apps look old-fashioned on Apples new Coconut-based devices . Not fun . <p> In the software world , things are always being " deprecated " which means that while they will continue to work , they will be done away with at some point in the future . So , you need to get busy and reprogram your stuff . For example , Google has deprecated the first version of its Chart API , and released a new API . As the shut-off date approached , I recoded all of the charts on my DailyJobsUpdate.com website . And just as I was getting ready to do the same to the charts in my BlubberPatrol Android app , Google announced that while the original chart API is still deprecated , they do n't  plan to turn it off any time soon . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like better than the new one . But if Google ever changes its mind , and turns it off , and I do n't  happen to catch the announcement , I will have to scramble to release a new version . That happens . Just ask Rob Walling ; he discusses such an incident at the beginning of this podcast . <p> In July 2012 , Apple deprecated its " Carbon " framework in favor of the new " Cocoa " framework . Granted , a big change like this does n't  happen very often , but change is coming faster and faster making life harder for RAD designers to keep up . In any case , when selecting a RAD tool , you want to choose one that can generate apps for the current frameworks , and is made by a company that has the staying power to keep up-to-date . You definitely want a tool that can produce Cocoa apps on the Mac and . NET apps on Windows . Android updates are much more frequent , so talk to the user community online or at local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for staying current . <h> Critical Framework Support <p> Before choosing a RAD tool , you should identify the major features of your app . For example , if you will be selling it to the public , how will you collect payment ? Will your app do push notifications ? Etcetera . Make a list of these features , and make sure that your RAD tool supports them , or if not , whether there are third-party plugins available . Because if you have to dive down and implement such things yourself , your productivity is going to get torpedoed . <h> So , When Should You Use a RAD Tool ? <p> First of all , pretty much any kind of hobbyist app can be easily handled by a RAD tool . If you want to write an app to catalog your bug collection , you will get it done twice as fast as you would with a 3GL . RAD tools can also handle most data-centric apps . So , if you have a million different bugs in your collection , do n't  give it a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be fine . <p> Personal productivity apps , such as a customized to-do list are suitable for RAD tools , as well as office productivity apps : accounting , payroll , customer database , etc . <p> RAD tools are often used at the enterprise level , for example to build front-ends to huge databases . <p> RAD tools can be used for some kinds of games . For example , here is an implementation of Flappy Bird written in Xojo . <p> RAD tools can even be used to write RAD tools . For example , Xojo is coded in Xojo . This is called " self hosting " and is pretty solid evidence that the tool can handle large , complex projects . Xojo can also build web apps . <p> Many apps sold to consumers are written with RAD tools , and the original incarnation of BitTorrent was written in Python , which is not strictly speaking a RAD tool , but you might call it a 3.5GL . BitTorrent has since been rewritten in C++ , but that was only after it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of handling large projects . However , as we discussed , RAD tools are ambitions programs and require a lot of time to develop . So , if you want to be first to market on a new platform , RAD tools are pretty much out of the question . If you want to be there on Day One with your dashboard app when the first AppleCar rolls off the assembly line in 2019 , I suggest that you start learning Swift right now , or make the acquaintance of a Swift programmer to contract with once Apple releases the SDK ( software development kit ) . <p> On the other hand , you can be there on Day One with a RAD tool when new APIs are released for existing platforms . For example , when WordPress releases its much-anticipated REST API , RAD developers just might be the first to market with client apps in many categories . <p> If you are trying to win design awards , you probably do n't  want to use a RAD tool since it may not support the fancy things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a game that pushes the hardware , you probably want to use a 3GL . If you are doing something very innovative then you probably want to use the platform vendors tools . <p> If you are developing a mobile app , and you want it to run on both iOS and Android you are faced with a choice : You can hire two programmers , one to write the iOS version in Objective-C or Swift , and another one to write the Android version in Java . Or you can hire one guy to do both apps in a RAD tool like Xamarin . Obviously , Xamarin is going to win a lot of these jobs because it can do them for half the price in half the time . <h> Why I Like to Use RAD Tools <p> Many " real " programmers would n't be caught dead writing an app with a RAD tool . They think that RAD tools are for a lower tier of coders who just ca n't handle real programming . Sort of like an automatic transition in a car for the " idiots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gears . But even though I am a " real " programmer with a CS degree , I prefer to develop apps with RAD tools . Why ? Because I like to get things done . I like to finish projects quickly , so that I can go onto the next challenge . If you have a lot of ideas , and you want to bring them to life , a RAD tool can help make it happen a lot faster . Thirty years ago , I began writing software with Omnis 3 . Then , I switched to Visual Basic for many years , and for the past fifteen years , I have been using Xojo . I made a lot of money and had a lot of fun . RAD is good stuff . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 2 thoughts on " Should You Use a RAD Tool for Your Software Project ? " <p> Great article Matt !

@@88484329 @3984329/ <h> Superpower Smackdown Germany vs . China <p> I 'm talking about economic superpowers here ; so that disqualifies the USA . The USA is destined to become a gigantic version of North Korea : militaristic , belligerent , aggressive , with an army we cant afford , and populated by vast swaths of ignorant impoverished peasants swayed by ridiculous propaganda . Our food-stamp population already doubles North Koreas entire population ( see the chart here ) . And Colin Powells 2003 speech to justify the conquest of Iraq is a prime example of preposterous propaganda . <p> Germany and China are economic superpowers because they have exchange-rate dominance . The Germans keep their European Union satellites enslaved via the euro . The Chinese have been transferring the USAs industrial power to themselves via their yuan-dollar currency peg . Consequently , Germany and China have become what are called " surplus nations " , which is a nice way of saying " your rulers " . <p> Germany and China have trade surpluses because they have been able to tilt the playing field in their favor through currency machinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weak currency and adopts the strong euro . What happens to their trade situation ? All of a sudden , their exporters are quoting prices in euros , which means they have to compete head-to-head with the Germans on price . And if they are n't  as efficient as the Germans , then they lose market share . <p> Traditionally , when a countrys economy was in trouble , they would throw a nation-wide sale by devaluing their currency . By sprinkling extra currency around the world , they made their exports more affordable , enticed foreigners to come for cheap vacations , etc . But German satellites are not allowed to do that ; they are not allowed to print euros . <p> So why do n't  struggling EU countries ditch the euro , re-establish their own currencies , devalue , and live happily ever after ?

And a few days ago , we saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel say ( story here ) : <p> " No one should take it for granted that there will be peace and affluence in Europe in the next half century . " <p> Was that a threat to EU nations contemplating an escape from the euro ? Maybe not , but then again , such things are rarely stated directly . But if there is a threat , then that would explain very nicely why EU countries are lashing themselves with austerity : because an escape attempt would bring even harsher measures . <p> Germany wins this smackdown because they can enforce stricter discipline than China .

The Chinese and their multinational partners have obviously succeeded in purchasing Congress and the White House , but the Fed stubbornly insists on exercising sovereign powers on behalf of the American economy . <p> While QE2 did not restore robust growth to the US economy , it did force the Chinese to print more yuan to maintain their currency peg . And that created inflation in China , which raised the cost of sweatshop labor , and gave American domestic manufacturers some breathing room . <p> Without QE2 , there would be Chinese officials in Washington right now dictating austerity terms just like the Germans in Athens . <p> And if a knucklehead like Rick Perry or Ron Paul gets their way with the Fed , then the above outcome will be a done deal . <p> michael pettis has a good blog post this week on currency intervention and trade balance . while he is a cheerleader for global free trade , he does point out that currency manipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that china basically has no way to counter if the united states intervenes : <p> " Diversified economies with high unemployment and large current account deficits the U.S. generally benefit , at the expense of their trade partners , from trade intervention .

And yes , I have daily recordings going back to 1993 amounting to 7,150 data points as of the time of this writing , August 8 , 2012 . <p> Notice that I have kept my weight between 152-155 for the last 10 years . The secret ? Eternal vigilance . And nothing is better for staying vigilant than looking at a chart each morning . BlubberPatrol makes daily , weekly , monthly , and yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long-term trends . <p> Quick Start <p> BlubberPatrol use the Google Chart API to make its charts . So , your device must be connected to the internet for the app to work properly . However , you can enter your weight while offline . <p> BlubberPatrol comes with sample data so that you can see how all the charts work . Once you are satisfied , go onto the menu and use the " Delete Sample Data " command . <p> Enter your weight at the top of the screen each day , or week . Do n't  worry about skipping days . <p> You can switch between the charts by using the menu , but if your device supports it , you can also swipe left or right to cycle through the charts . <p> Show Data This command will show the data points plotted on the chart . And that can be different from what the " Edit Data " command shows you in two ways . First , you can enter more than one decimal point when entering your weight , but charts are rounded-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly , and yearly charts are averages while the data stored in the database is daily one record for each day . Its confusing at first , but it makes sense once you think about it . <p> Edit Data This command let 's you edit one weight record at a time so that you can correct any errors that you may have made . It will always show you the same list of days from which to choose . For example , you cant edit the values on the yearly chart because those values do not exist in the database , but rather are calculated from the daily records . <p> Export Data This command will put all of your weight data into a text file named " blubber-export.txt " in your " Download " folder . If you want to copy the file to your computer via USB , you may have to reboot your Android device before it will show up on your desktop . The file is " tab delimited " , so each line has the date , then a tab , and then the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a word-processor or spreadsheet program like Excel . <p> If you export again , the previous blubber-export.txt file will be over-written . So , move it , or rename it , if you want to save it . In most cases it wont be an issue because you will still have all your data inside the app . <p> Import Data This command will look for a file named " blubber-import.txt " in your " Download " folder , and then load in its data . If you want to start fresh with the data that you import , you can delete all of your existing data by **25;0;TOOLONG the app , then using the " Delete Sample Data " command . If you keep your existing data , the new data imported will not over-write your existing data in cases where a day already exists . Since there can only be one weight per day , duplicate days in the imported data will not be saved . <p> The data must be in a tabbed-delimited format with one day per line : first the date in YYYY-MM-DD format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what it should look like , use the Export Data command first and examine the blubber-export.txt file . <p> This feature works , however it is not tuned for high performance . I 'm guessing that you wont be using it very often . So , if you are going to import a lot of data , set aside some time where you wont be needing to use your device for other things . <p> If the program ca n't understand any of the data , it will tell you at the end : " Could not parse x record(s) . " If x is a large number , you will probably want to fix your data and re-import it . If x is a small number in a large amount of data , letting those records go wo n't likely make a visible impact on your charts . You can make a new blubber-import.txt file with just the fixed records , and import it , and only those records will be added to the database the records do n't  have to be imported in date-sequence . <p> If something goes wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just do the import again . BlubberPatrol will skip the records already imported and resume with the remainder . You do n't  need to edit your import file ; no duplicate records will be created . <p> Hardware Support I tested BlubberPatrol extensively on all Android platform versions going back to 2.1 . So that 's Eclair , Froyo , Gingerbread , Honeycomb , Ice Cream Sandwich , and Jelly Bean . I tested on my tablet , which has Ice Cream Sandwich , and used Googles emulator to test the rest . If the Play Store let 's you install it , it should run on your device . Of course , there are literally thousands of different Android devices out there , so I 'm sure somebody will encounter a problem . If you do so , please write a comment below .

A doctor would call this a " sub-clinical " condition because it is not caused by a disease . Sub-clinical conditions also do not get much research because they are not considered serious . Of course , if you can not turn your head far enough to see where you are going when backing your car out of a parking space , it could become very serious indeed for somebody walking behind you . <p> Sub-clinical conditions are a hobby of mine . When you have something as complicated as the human body , and no research being done on a condition , you have a good mystery to solve . <p> One day in February 2008 , I woke up with intense pain in my upper back , between my shoulder blades . It was incredibly intense ; like I had been stabbed . I literally almost could not get out of bed . I eventually staggered over to my computer and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conclusion , I ate a handful of Walgreens brand antacid tablets , which are a Tums knock-off . ( If you do n't  have Walgreens or Tums in your country , any calcium-carbonate antacid would work fine . ) I felt the difference almost immediately . I was up and shadow-boxing in just a few minutes . It felt like a miracle . I used the antacid because everything I had in the house was acidic , which is how I got into this condition in the first place , of course . <p> There are many reasons to " eat your greens " , but probably the most over-looked one is that they help you maintain your acid/alkaline balance . Staying in balance is crucial to health and probably why the folk remedy of using fresh fruit to cure the cold , flu , etc. works so well . The slogan , " An Apple a Day Keeps the Doctor Away " probably has its roots in the fact that apples are alkaline . <p> While researching this , I found many web sites claiming that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think that is crazy . The very idea of " sleeping injuries " seems ridiculous to me . Yes , you can sleep on your arm and cut off the circulation , but do we really need to work on our sleeping skills to avoid injury in this " dangerous " activity ? I do n't  think so . Rather , I think that while you are sleeping , you are not eating anything that your body can use to reduce acidity , so that is a prime time for your muscles to stiffen up . I have also had this pain strike me during the day , so I 'm certain that it has nothing to do with sleep itself . <p> I am no biochemist , but it appears that your body can use calcium to reduce the acidity of your blood . By using up all your calcium , you develop an electrolyte deficiency . Your nervous system uses sodium , potassium , and calcium to propagate signals along your nerves . So , what I think causes the pain is nerves going haywire due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alkaline ( especially calcium-carbonate ) can provide instant relief : your muscles are not really damaged at all ; they are only malfunctioning because your nervous system is not sending them the right signals . So , you do n't  need any time to heal . <p> The first thing I did after making this discovery was to eat a lot more fruit . I had some juice with every meal , and ate a couple of pieces of fresh fruit each day . It worked , but my weight started to go up from all those extra carbohydrates . Then I noticed that lemons were at the top of the alkaline-foods list , so I ditched the juice and started putting lemon juice in my drinks . It worked beautifully . <p> While I was googling around researching this , I found several good clues , but nobody who had put them all together as I have done here . It is possible that somebody wrote this in a health book somewhere , but if Google does n't  know about it , does it really exist ? Until further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this miracle cure . <p> If you think you can continue eating your acidic diet and balance it out with a lot of antacid , you are mistaken . The calcium in the antacid will cause a mineral imbalance . For example , it might induce a zinc deficiency and cause persistent acne . Its just not a good idea . Only use antacid in an emergency . <p> This , of course , is not professional medical advice . If your pain persists , you need to see your doctor since it could be something serious like tetany. 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 9 thoughts on " Miracle Stiff-Neck Cure " <p> I remember reading this post some time back ( around the time that you and I were emailing about the treasury receipts data ) .

@@88484345 @3984345/ <h> Continuation Gap <p> Continuation Gaps occur during strong trends , and are also referred to as " Runaway " and " Measuring " gaps . During strong trends , prices look like they are " running away " because pullbacks , if any at all , are brief and shallow . And since continuation gaps often occur at the halfway point of a trend , we can use them to measure the ultimate length of the trend . <p> Here is a 60-minute SPY chart showing the continuation gap from November 9 , 2009 ( click to enlarge ) : <p> The low before the trend begins is on November 4th at Point " A " on the chart . SPY advances relentlessly for two days to Point " B " . So , we have our first requirement : a strong trend . <p> On the morning of November 9th , SPY gaps up ( red box ) , leaves almost the entire gap unfilled , and continues to rally sharply . And we have our second requirement : a sizable gap . <p> To estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first leg from Point " A " to Point " B " . Start measuring from the point where prices first took off , and stop at the close of the day before the gap . That height is shown as " Line 1 " on the chart . <p> On the day the gap occurs , you can duplicate " Line 1 " on your chart to make " Line 2 " , and then drag it so that it begins at " Point C " which is the top of the gap . The top of " Line 2 " is the measured target for the trend , " Point D " . <p> In this example , the target was hit two days later ( and exceeded a little bit ) at the blue arrow on the chart . Notice that the trend promptly came to an end after the level of " Point D " was attained . SPY then pulled back and consolidated for the three days . <p> The next chart is a bearish continuation gap from October 6 , 2008 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap . Here I drew a Fibonacci grid from the previous swing high such that the center of the gap was placed at the 50% mark . Then the 100% level of 101.70 became the target : <p> And later in the day , SPY did indeed hit the target : <p> So , that 's a different way of projecting a target than the lines used in the first example . Now , let 's look further at this gap . <p> Whenever you have a large gap that is accompanied with a surge of volume , you have a serious event because it indicates that large players are making large moves . <p> Here is the same chart as the one above with volume added : <p> After SPY opened , it continued to plunge on heavy volume . The black arrow points to the volume of the first hour of trading . Notice that it was almost double that of any of the previous few days ( blue arrows ) . That was a significant event , so we want to look at the bigger picture . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fibonacci grid such that the gap falls at the 50% level from the last swing high : <p> That exercise gave us an 89.74 target for SPY , which it did indeed go on to hit . Now , look at the blue arrow . The trend came to an end , and SPY began to consolidate in a range , as soon as SPY came near the gap projection . <p> Double Gaps Here is a chart of Citigroup ( symbol : C ) making two continuation gaps in a row : <p> On July 17 , 2008 , you might have projected a target of 19.00 from the mornings gap ( blue box ) . But then the next morning , Citigroup gapped right up and over your target ( purple box ) . That was a very powerful move , so you would have wanted to update your target . The way to handle this situation , according to the textbook , is to put your midpoint between the two gaps . <p> In this case , I drew a green box from the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap , and then placed my 50% level in the center of the box . That raised the target from 19.00 to 20.85 . Citigroup topped out a bit higher than that , but it worked out pretty well : <p> Identification How can you tell a continuation gap from other types of gaps ? One clue is when you have a strong trend that has not had any substantial pullbacks , and has not yet made any gaps . In that scenario , the relentless price movement makes a " gap and go " day a good possibility . If a powerful catalyst occurs before the open , then that increases the odds even more .

When I first published this book in 2013 , there was very little discussion of oligarchy in the USA . Now , everybody is talking about it . The forces that I document here are what drove the Brexit vote in the UK , and enabled Donald Trump to become president . Now , even the oligarchs themselves are talking about how they may have " flooded the system " with too much cheap labor . Really ? You think ?

On purpose . And for profit . But most of all , for principle . The principle of oligarchy . The principle that only the elect deserve wealth and power . <p> When Walmart commands an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so because the switch to barbaric sweatshop production will increase Walmarts profits . However , Walmart also feels justified in redistributing the income of the laid-off American workers to itself because they believe themselves to be superior managers of capital ; because those extra profits will enable them to do that much more of " gods work . " <p> This is actually an announced policy of the Oligarchy . For example , unofficial spokesman Edward Conard , formerly of Bain Capital wrote : <p> " Unequal distribution of income has critical motivational effects that are especially important for growth via risky innovation . " 1 <p> Translated from MBA gobbledygook : since the " small people " are too conservative to invest their money in risky start-up companies , they should be paid less money so that oligarchs like Conard can be paid more . The oligarchs will then bravely , and nobly , make the investments that will lead to better jobs for the small people . So , the reason why income-inequality has worsened in the USA is because it is our policy . <p> Critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national economic-development policy , but we most certainly do . Its called favelization : the conversion of a once prosperous middle class into dwellers of Brazilian-style favela slums . And it is imposed on America by multinational corporations like Walmart , Bain Capital , GE , etc . Favelization was put into motion decades ago by David Rockefeller . In his 2002 book Memoirs , Rockefeller hands down a stone tablet : <p> " Global interdependence is not a poetic fantasy but a concrete reality that this centurys revolutions in technology , communications , and geopolitics have made irreversible . The free flow of investment capital , goods , and people across borders will remain the fundamental factor in world economic growth and in the strengthening of democratic institutions everywhere . " 2 <p> That is a declaration of victory . Especially notice the " free flow of people and goods " part . That means cheap sweatshop goods , and low-wage immigrant workers the two primary forces destroying the middle class . Those things are near and dear to Rockefellers heart . After all , he learned about crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking Colorado miners in the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 . <p> What does Rockefeller mean by an irreversible , geopolitical , revolution ? Quite simply , he means conquest . He is telling us that the USA is no longer a sovereign nation in control of its borders . That the vast tide of cheap , imported goods and low-wage workers will not stop . And he was n't lying . A few years after he wrote his book , during the high unemployment of the Great Recession , no mercy was shown . The mass offshoring of jobs , and the mass immigration of low-paid workers went ahead full speed , greatly extending the suffering of the people . History will record that policy as a brutal economic crackdown on the middle class . <p> There may not be a political " New World Order " but there most certainly is an economic one , and it is designed solely for the enrichment of Rockefellers modern American Oligarchy . <p> Of course , it does n't  have to be like this . During the Great Depression , the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the foundation from which the middle class sprung . The Oligarchy planned a counterattack : they were preparing to overthrow newly-elected president Franklin D. Roosevelt , but General Smedley Butler blew the whistle on the Business Plot of 1933 . <p> The Oligarchy , being worried about a communist revolution like Russias , did n't  press the issue and gave up their fascist dream . They grudgingly permitted the " small people " to have their pet " socialist " president , but then dogged his every move . Eventually , the people had to take matters into their own hands with the wildcat , sit-down strikes of 1936-1937 . They won , and forced Congress to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 . They also pressured the federal government to restrict immigration , which did far more to raise wages than the new minimum-wage law . After that foundation was completed , a mighty middle class rose from the ashes of the Oligarchys sweatshops . <p> After World War II , the Oligarchy made lemonade from their lemons . They touted Americas prosperous middle class during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proved to be the ultimate secret weapon . The downtrodden masses of communist nations around the world were dazzled by the comparative opulence of the USAs middle class , and faith in communism was fatally undermined . <p> With the demise of the Soviets , the military wing of the Oligarchy no longer had to win the hearts and minds of Americans to support the war effort . And so the time was ripe for David Rockefeller to restore the Financial Oligarchy to absolute power . The middle class could now be dispatched ; the mere Potemkin Village used to fool the Soviets was no longer needed . Imagine ! Common assembly-line workers being paid $100,000 salaries ! Preposterous ! It was time to strike the set , to decommission the middle class like an old battleship . <p> Indeed , no time was wasted after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 . Only three years later , The North American Free Trade Act ( NAFTA ) was signed into law , and so began the mass conversion of well-paid , middle-class jobs into badly-paid Third-World sweatshop jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive wave of immigrants was brought in to outsource them . In that same year of 1989 , legal immigration soared above one million for the first time since 1914 . And it has remained at that rate ever since . The purpose of which is to construct what Karl Marx called the Reserve Army of Labor : a vast over-supply of people whose existence is used to terrify workers into accepting rock-bottom wages . <p> What we are witnessing is nothing short of absolute victory for the Oligarchy . <p> To make room for all of that , the Great Architect had to erase a few things first : American sovereignty , the Glass-Steagall Act , the New Deal , labor unions , the Fairness Doctrine , etc . <p> And he s not quite done . The holy grail will be to have full-blown sweatshops on American soil ( not just Saipan , see below ) , no taxes on job-creators ( oligarchs ) , no pesky rule of law , complete surveillance of the small people , and devouring ( a.k.a. " privatizing " ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office . <p> Could the Great Architect pass a PCL-R psychopath test ? Not a chance . <p> This is David Rockefellers world , and you are just living in it . And Rockefeller has designed this New World Order in his image . Rockefeller was a banker , so that is why we have a " financialized " economy rather than a militarized economy . While the conspiracy community was looking for black helicopters , and the blue helmets of United Nations troops , Rockefeller was constructing an economic dictatorship . <p> The Dark Arts of the American Oligarchy are the devious methods used to undermine the American laws that constructed the middle class . Now in their fourth decade of successful operation , the middle class has not yet caught onto the Dark Arts . Stupefied by the propaganda of the Oligarch Media , what is left of the once mighty American middle class is being slowly boiled like the proverbial frog . <p> In 1971 , 61% of American households were middle class . By 2011 , that percentage had been reduced to 51% ( link ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see the work of the Dark Arts . The red line is corporate profits ( CPROFIT ) , which are at historic highs . The blue line is the " labor share " ( wages , salaries , and benefits ) of total income ( PRS85006173 ) , which is at an historic low . <p> As shocking as this chart is , the average worker is getting an even smaller slice of the pie because the labor-share includes the huge salaries of top athletes , entertainers , and overpaid CEOs . <p> The hard truth is that todays record corporate profits have come , not from management " genius " , but directly out of the hides of former middle-class workers . This is the chart that every oligarch has tucked under his pillow at night . When he has a bad dream , he pulls out the chart , gives it a kiss , and clutches it to his chest . Then he falls back asleep to sweet dreams of a nation covered from sea to shining sea with shantytowns and sweatshops stuffed with the " small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age of Globalist Carpetbaggers <p> After the Civil War , Northerners moved to southern states to take advantage of the reconstruction process . For example , they bought-up the land of former slave plantations very cheaply . The defeated Southerners derisively called the invaders from the north " carpetbaggers " because they often arrived with luggage made from old carpeting . <p> We are seeing the same phenomena today . Our " genius " corporate CEOs like Mitt Romney , Jeff Immelt , and the Walton Family make their fortunes by quite literally feeding off the corpse of a defeated USA . <p> The euphemism " globalization " is used to describe this flat-out looting of the middle class . Multinational CEOs act like they are geniuses , but how smart would they look if you took away their cheap labor , brutal workplaces , and lax environmental and safety laws ? Could somebody like Mitt Romney start a company from scratch in Ohio , paying middle-class wages to every member of his staff , and be a success ? Probably not . The truth is that modern CEOs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American companies , firing the well-paid workers , moving the facilities to someplace like China , and then operating them like slave plantations . <p> This is the age in which we live . We are a defeated people . The Rockefeller War against America achieved decisive victory on December 11 , 2001 when the globalists brought China into the World Trade Organization . So , the blood has been in the water for over a decade , and the feeding frenzy of oligarch sharks has reached a fevered pitch . So much so that a globalist carpetbagger , Mitt Romney , was almost elected president . <p> Civil War carpetbaggers were not all greedy opportunists . For example , many went to the South to establish schools for former slave children since there were no public schools . Today , many globalists see themselves in the same light , as bringing progress to a backward , provincial America . But they are clearly delusional . The mass poverty that has exploded across the USA during this era of globalist carpetbagging is irrefutable proof of that delusion . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multinationals have gone beyond the commercial arena and have usurped the sovereign power of the American people . The American people did not want to send 50,000+ factories out of the country , but Walmart ordered it done . The American people did not want mass immigration , but IBM replaces its American staff with cheaper Asian immigrants . This is not acceptable corporate behavior . <h> Will the Middle Class Go Quietly ? <p> So far , that is exactly what is has done . For example , there has been no resistance at all as well-paid IT workers are replaced with badly-paid Indian immigrants even as the process has intensified in recent years . Severance pay is used to encourage citizens to go quietly and even train their foreign replacements . Trade unions have offered what amounts to token resistance . <p> If the middle class ever does decide to fight back , there is a vast security apparatus ready to make sure that they keep on marching out to pasture . Just like the security guards that escort you from the office when you are fired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class from its traditional place in the American economy . If you pack your stuff in a box and go quietly , there wont be any trouble , and your severance check will arrive on time . If you want to make a fuss , well then , you will get pepper-sprayed and no payoff . <p> Is there any hope ? Sure . As a matter of fact , we already have a blueprint for what needs to be done : re-implement the policies that we adopted during the Great Depression . In other words , nothing radical is needed only a traditional response to contain the excesses of an out-of-control Oligarchy . After all , caging the Oligarchy is what made the USA a superpower in the first place . <p> The Oligarchy began to lose its patience with the middle class in the early 1970s . They were particularly incensed by the new mass-media of television where their dirty deeds were exposed by crusading journalists . And so began the historic drive to concentrate media ownership into the hands of a few large corporations . It worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media keeps the spotlight off of them . They have n't been able to keep the American people totally in the dark , but they have done a surprisingly thorough job . <p> Globalization is a Dark Art because it is portrayed in the media as the world becoming one big , happy family . In reality , globalization is primarily the mechanism by which the Oligarchy has resurrected the sweatshops that were banned from the USA seventy years ago . <p> Even worse , globalization is designed to weaken American sovereignty to the point where the people will not have the power to reign-in the Oligarchy as they did during the Great Depression . We got a little taste of that after the 2011 Japanese earthquake/tsunami when many American auto plants had to shut down for lack of parts from Japan . That type of industrial dependency is an announced policy of the Oligarchy . They are doing their best to make globalization technically irreversible . <p> The laws creating globalization were constructed in secret , rammed through Congress with an unconstitutional " fast track " process , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no elected representatives . The Oligarchy enacts its laws within the bodies of so-called " trade treaties . " Those massive documents are then dropped on Congress where your representatives rubber-stamp them without even reading them because everybody just knows that " trade is good . " And yes , that 's a fascist process . <h> At its Heart , Globalization is a Criminal Operation <p> What laws is globalization breaking ? For starters , The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 which , among other things , established the minimum wage . That law cut into corporate profits . And since overturning the law is not politically feasible , it has been necessary for the Oligarchy to sneak around it . While this sneaking may not have been technically illegal , its intent was clearly criminal . Today , a large percentage of the products that you buy are made by Third-World workers who are paid far less than American minimum wage . <p> This dramatic evasion of the law is made possible by globalization . For example , if a corporation wants to slash its payroll to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mexico , it requires that there be no barriers to trade , money , or the movement of personnel . Any pesky sovereign powers asserted by the American , or Mexican people must be simply swept away . <p> Multinational employees must be free to travel back-and-forth to Mexico . The products made in the new plant must be free to enter the USA with little or no tariff assessed . Profits generated by the new plant must be free to cross the border back to the USA so that they can be paid out in dividends to oligarchs . And of course , the oligarchs must then be free to send their money to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland since tax evasion is their favorite pastime . <p> In short , Mexico could not be used as a lever to eradicate the American middle class until the border was globalized . Once NAFTA completed the globalization , the Oligarchy moved over a million factory jobs out of the USA . As a side benefit , " runaway shops " also dramatically weakened the Oligarchys arch enemy : labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unionize , then union political power disappears . If there are no assembly lines to sit on , then there can be no sit-down strikes . <p> The more low-down a nation is , the more the oligarchy wants to " globalize " our relations . For example , moving plants to China is very profitable because labor unions are illegal there , and the totalitarian government in Beijing will keep it that way for as long as possible . So , an oligarch can rest easy that his Chinese sweatshops will generate large profits for as long as Beijing has tanks to run over striking workers . <h> Oligarchization <p> The World Trade Organization is presented as a place where nations negotiate rules to facilitate trade and economic development that all members will follow . However , notice that only certain laws are harmonized . After running roughshod over scores of American laws , such as our dolphin-safe tuna labels , globalists go berserk when it is suggested that , for example , the Mexican minimum wage be harmonized with the U.S. minimum wage . The globalists shriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign nation ! We do n't  dare interfere in their internal affairs . What are you , some kind of imperialist ? " <p> And that puts the lie to globalization . In fact , globalization should be renamed " oligarchization " because the global system has been re-engineered as a playground for a new breed of robber baron . And since the American people will not willingly give up their robber-baron restrictions , the USA has been stripped of much of its sovereignty over economic issues . And so has Mexico as we will discuss later . <h> Musical Countries <p> Having one " globalized " country is not enough for the oligarchs . Imagine how profits would be slashed if the workers of China rose up and actually made some progress for themselves . The oligarchs want nothing to do with that , and so they always keep other tyrannical nations in reserve . In the above scenario , they would move their Chinese sweatshops down to Vietnam or Bangladesh . If Mexican workers were finally able to get paid more than $2 per hour , the maquiladoras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically hunted for sport . <p> This game of " musical countries " 4 is insidious because the nefarious nations of the world know exactly what is expected of them : brutal repression of their workers . So , while China is doing everything it can to repress its workers , so is Vietnam because they want to be ready to eat Chinas lunch if China eventually drops the ball . The euphemism " race to the bottom " is really a race to tyranny . By ceding control of trade policy to the Oligarchy , we have permitted them to spread tyranny worldwide . <h> Labor Strip Mining <p> As the oligarchs survey the world , they are looking for large deposits of juicy cheap labor , combined with a toxic core of tyranny . If they can strike a deal with the local tyrants , they put in the infrastructure ( sweatshops , ports , etc. ) necessary to mine the labor . Operations continue as long as the " labor resources " remain content with their semi-slavery . If they rise up , and force their tyrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs when the Oligarchy pulls up stakes and heads to the next deposit . <p> This is almost exactly the same process as mining minerals or drilling oil . The populations in places like Nigeria and Indonesia must be pacified before oil &amp; gas production can proceed . In labor strip mining , sweatshops are installed instead of drilling rigs . <p> White-collar jobs are also offshored , of course . So much so that IBM , a leader in the " destroying America " field has elevated it to a science , and filed for a patent on a system to asses global labor " resource pools : " <p> " An important challenge in shifting to globally integrated enterprises is planning the location and capacity of the global workforce . There is a need to provide a robust and reusable sourcing template to identify new/expand existing global resource pools , analyze trade-off between qualitative and quantitative aspects across multiple global locations and model the global nature of resource sourcing . " <h> Polluting for Profit <p> While labor is usually the single largest business expense , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also costs money for industrial companies . <p> Suppose a company wants to increase profits by violating the Clean Water Act of 1972 by dumping industrial waste into a river . There would be penalties for that if they got caught , but if they move the plant to the Mexican city of Mexicali , they can dump in the New River , which flows into California . Through the magic of globalization , they are getting away with polluting the USA again ! <p> American factories are clean , safe , efficient , high-tech , and world-class . And that 's another driving force of globalization . You see , the multinationals would have never constructed those factories if they were not forced to do so by U.S. law because all of that good stuff costs money , and state-of-the-art factories are far less profitable than sweatshops . <p> In countries like China , Mexico , and India , an oligarch can get away with all kinds of low-down behavior that is no longer permitted in the USA while simultaneously retaining the privilege of selling his products to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globalized ? <p> Globalization erases national borders , however , erasing the USAs borders takes top priority because we have the largest consumer market to feed with cheap imports , and a highly-paid middle class to monetize with low-wage immigrant workers and offshoring . The USA is the juiciest target on the planet . That 's why we are taking all the arrows . <p> In 1853 , Commodore Perry sailed into Tokyo harbor with a squadron of U.S. Navy ships equipped with the first naval guns able to fire explosive shells instead of just cannonballs . Staring down the barrel of those guns , the Japanese agreed to open their country to trade with the USA . <p> Now it is our turn to be globalized . The process is more sneaky than what we did to the Japanese , but is not fundamentally different . The entity globalizing us is not another nation , but rather an Oligarchy loyal to no nation . <h> Globalization as Fascism <p> Our current state of globalization has progressed to the point where multinationals are able to extract bribes in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants from leaving . When GE threatens to move an appliance plant to Mexico , it is a much more credible threat than it was in the past because the border with Mexico has been globalized . So , companies have increased negotiating ( or if you prefer , blackmailing ) power with local governments . <p> In many cases , state governments allow corporations to keep the state income taxes withheld from employee paychecks . See this Huffington Post story , and the " Paying Taxes to the Boss " study from the Good Jobs First think tank . While these arrangements are not real fascism , you could call them " symbolic fascism . " The optics couldnt be worse , right ? The multinationals have become so powerful that they do n't  have to worry so much about public relations anymore . Who will say " boo " to them in a globalized economy with infinite cheap labor ? <p> And so we see another aspect of globalization : In addition to economic power , globalization shifts negotiating power to multinationals , and drains that power from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailout : An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street , Neil Barofsky describes government officials as being " deferential " to the financial corporations that they were rescuing . <p> And what comes after deference ? Obedience and then we have arrived at fascism . <p> " Fascism should rightly be called Corporatism , as it is the merger of corporate and government power . " -Benito Mussolini . <p> Though we are actually going beyond Mussolinis formulation . Multinationals are absorbing government powers rather than merely merging with government . <h> Marxian Globalization <p> Marx &amp; Engels supported free trade because they were globalists . Their idea was that once the nation-states were out of the way , and only one global government remained , their work of taking over the world would be much easier : only one government to overthrow instead of scores . <p> Today , the Oligarchy pursues the same Marxian goal of weakening nation-states with free trade . And for the same reason : maintaining global power . <p> We can see this policy in action today in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas produced by the fracking breakthrough ? Since the USA is not energy independent , one would think that exporting this bounty would be a bad idea . However , the Oligarchys propagandists are pounding the table for exportation on the principle that we must sacrifice our interests on the alter of the global economy ; that there should be no restrictions on corporate activity . And that the American people should just mind their own beeswax because the management of the economy is none of their business . Of course , an energy-independent America would be better able to shake off the globalist jackals tying it down , so naturally the Oligarchy seeks to suppress such a development . <h> The Apex of Globalization <p> The transfer of economic power from free-trading America to mercantilist China is the top historical development of our age . The apex of American power will be measured from 2001 , the year we brought China into the World Trade Organization . <p> And Marx &amp; Engels will drink a toast in Hell . A toast to the multinationals and oligarchs who have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communists ever dreamed of . Today , the USAs borders have been erased , for all practical intents and purposes , when it comes to trade and immigration . <p> Once the political process of globalization was completed , the oligarchs were able to turn up to full blast the process of global labor arbitrage . <p> " In this new era of globalization , the interests of companies and countries have diverged . In contrast with the past , what is good for Americas global corporations is no longer necessarily good for the American people . " <p> Global labor arbitrage is a technique used to cut your paycheck . It is made possible by borders wide open to trade and immigration . So , your boss might come to you and say : " Theres a guy in China who will work for a tenth of what you do . We can bring him here to replace you , or fire you and send your job over there . So , you need to take a pay cut to dissuade me from doing that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tariffs , restricted immigration , and unions . Not anymore . Those protections have been swept away for the express purpose of siphoning money out of your paycheck and into corporate profits . And , of course , a raise for your " genius " boss who increased the " efficiency " of his department . <h> $1.75 Trillion Siphoned from Middle Class <p> " Over the last decade , big American firms have cut around 3 million jobs in the U.S. while adding almost as many overseas . " <p> So , let 's run through some numbers . If we convert $30 per hour American workers into $2 per hour Mexican , Chinese , and Indian workers , corporate profits rise by $28 per worker per hour . And over the course of ten years , that amounts to $1.7 trillion transferred from the middle class to the oligarchs . Here is the spreadsheet ( click to enlarge ) : <p> Obviously , Mexicans , Chinese , and Indians do n't  pay taxes to Washington D.C. So we can also assume that a huge chunk of tax revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another large amount was drained from the treasury to support the workers that the multinationals kicked to the curb in the form of unemployment compensation , food stamps , retraining funds , etc . <p> There were more corporate profits to tax theoretically but corporations like to squirrel-away their profits in foreign tax havens . So , any way you slice it , global labor arbitrage damages the fiscal stability of the entire nation . And do n't  think the multinationals lose sleep over that . In fact , the weaker the federal government is , the more money they can make with free reign to implement further downgrades to working conditions in the USA . The Oligarchy only believes in a strong government when it is bailout time . <h> Your Tax Dollars Destroying Your Work <p> Even more outrageous is that your tax dollars go into training foreigners to take your job ! In 2010 , the US embassy in Sri Lanka announced : 5 <p> " Courses in Business Process Outsourcing , Enterprise Java , and English Language Skills will be offered at no charge to over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-job training schemes with private firms .

But two years later , another such program was announced ; this time in the Philippines , teaching college students English so that they could take call-center jobs from Americans . <p> You might call this a globalized version of the situation where an American worker is required to train his immigrant replacement before he is fired . Instead of training the immigrant at the office , the Americans tax dollars are sent to Asia to train somebody over there who will telecommute . <p> This makes you wonder : How much more of this kind of economic treason has been going on in secret ? How much " foreign aid " money has been diverted to Third World training- and infrastructure projects with the express purpose of facilitating the offshoring of U.S. jobs on behalf of multinational corporations ? How many railroad spurs in Mexico were built with foreign-aid money to help sweatshops export products to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call-centers in India ? This is a subject that is rarely discussed . However , in his 1981 book " Critical Path " R.Buckminster Fuller wrote ( page 105 ) : <p> " Foreign aid paid for all the new factories and machinery of all the American corporations moving out of America . " <p> Unfortunately , Fuller did n't  present any evidence to support his claim , but considering the two recent USAID stories , there is little doubt that we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg . <p> Foreign aid programs are suspect because the profits from global labor arbitrage are largest when your job is sent to the poorest of nations . <h> Choreographing the Exodus <p> First there were state laws establishing the " Right to Work " which effectively banned unions in the south , and the industrial norths factories moved to the sun-belt states . Then there was NAFTA , and the factories moved further south clear out of the country to Mexico . Then there was the " Uruguay Round " of GATT and a thousand Asian sweatshops bloomed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2001 , and the USAs economic back was broken in a massive tsunami of offshoring. 6 <p> It is critical to understand that none of this was an accident or happenstance . It was all very carefully orchestrated , and legislated with the goal of maximizing corporate profits . Notice that the flow of jobs was directed to places with a lower standard of living than the USAs industrial north because <h> Poverty is a Gold Mine <p> Global labor arbitrage is a weak force among nations with similar standards of living and labor rules . For example , suppose that you own a widget factory in Kansas and you pay your workers $30 per hour . If you could move your factory to Canada , and replace your American workers with $25 per-hour Canadians , you could save a little money . Canadian workers are not downtrodden ; they have mortgages to pay just like Americans , and they have unions too . <p> However , its a whole different story in Mexico . Moving your factory there would bring astronomical profits compared to Canada . Mexicans will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unionize , you just call the police who will come over and beat them senseless . <p> When it comes to labor arbitrage , the gold is in the poor countries that are open to labor strip-mining . Countries where labor organizers get a bullet in the head , where massive populations of poor people are grateful for any scraps thrown to them , and shantytowns blanket the land . So , the " giant sucking sound " came from the south , not the north . And later from China and India , not Japan and Germany . <h> There is a Lot of Ruin in a Nation <p> When NAFTA was implemented in January 1994 , the U.S. economy was in an expansion phase having just emerged from a recession little more than a year prior . So , the economy was doing fine , and probably would have continued to grow around 5% no matter what happened with NAFTA . But that did n't  stop the globalists from attributing strong U.S. growth to NAFTA . <p> In reality , the USA had a gargantuan industrial economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just flip a switch and send all of our industrial production south of the border . Obviously , many years of infrastructure construction were required before a significant chunk of our industrial base could be exported . Electricity grids , water &amp; sewer systems , telecommunications , sea ports , air ports , highways , railroads to ship the products back up to the USA , shantytowns for the sweatshop workers , and mass graves for labor leaders all had to be constructed . <p> " Young man , there 's a lot of ruin in a nation " is how Adam Smith replied to a student who told him that the surrender at Yorktown would be the ruin of England . And while Yorktown did prove to be the decisive victory of the Revolutionary War , Smiths point was still valid . If the British really wanted to fight on , they could have easily done so . <p> In the mid 1990s , there was still a lot of ruin left in the USA . The modern era of free-trade with low-wage nations was just in its infancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA practiced what might be called " geopolitical free trade . " During the Cold War , the USA sought to build up Germany and Japan after having smashed them in World War II . Both Germany and Japan were nose-to-nose with the Soviets , and it was thought that giving them access to the USAs huge consumer market would be an effective way to strengthen them and contain the Soviets . <p> In fact , the USA went as far as transferring entire industries . For example , the American television-set manufacturing industry was essentially handed over to the Japanese for political reasons . From WSJ.com : 7 <p> " Few industries have fallen as hard as television manufacturing . In the 1950s , there were some 150 domestic producers and with employment peaking at about 100,000 people in the 1960s . Then came the imports , first from Japan and later from other parts of Asia . TV manufacturing in the U.S. went all but extinct in the last decade . " <p> However , back then , we still had limits . President Reagan restricted Japanese auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . We had not won the Cold War yet , and de-industrializing on a mass scale was n't exactly a bright idea even if the Japanese were our allies . <h> An Unauthorized Trade Revolution <p> In its early history , the USA was a protectionist nation . After World War II , our first phase of free-trade began in order to build up the constituent countries of our military empire as a bulwark against the Soviets . And perhaps that was in our national interest . <p> After the fall of the Soviet Union , we entered the second , and current phase of our free-trade history . And while it may look like a continuation of the first-phase on the surface , it is , in fact , a completely different animal . In the first phase , free-trade laws were made to benefit the American empire , if not the homeland itself . In the current phase , free-trade laws are made strictly for the benefit of multinational corporations with an explicit intent to harm the homeland . <p> That was a radical change . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . <p> The American people were not eager to export their jobs to foreign lands , and they pressured their representatives in Congress to make sure that that did n't  happen . So , the Oligarchy came up with " fast track authority " where Congress agreed to special rules for trade laws . <p> Fast-track rules meant that Congress could no longer amend or filibuster the trade treaties sent to it by the White House . And that increased Congress ability to resist pressure from the people . <p> However , Congress is not allowed to decide what its powers are . That is determined by the Constitution , Article I , Section 8 , Clause 3 : <p> The Congress shall have Power To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian tribes ; <p> Congress first illegally transferred this power to the executive branch to negotiate treaties . Then it shielded itself from public pressure with fast-track rules , and finally it transferred the governance of trade treaties to transnational bodies like the World Trade Organization . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revoked immediately . <p> Our trade treaties have implemented a form of economics that has been rejected by the American people : laissez-faire . <p> " In the world of labor as in the world of business , the advent of the giant corporation and the very wealthy employer has meant that the absence of all governmental supervision implies the emergence of a very few exceptionally powerful men at the head , and the stamping out of all individual initiative and power lower down . Unrestricted individualism in violence during the Dark Ages merely produced a class of brutal and competent individual fighters at the top , resting on a broad foundation of abject serfs below . Unrestricted individualism in the modem industrial world produces results very little better " <p> -President Theodore Roosevelt ( 1911 ) <p> Laissez-faire is French for " let do " or " let them do as they will . " It is a popular concept in a nation like the USA that believes in free enterprise , but it is terribly simplistic . After all , should your utility company be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to the point where you can no longer afford food ? Of course not , and so the American people rejected laissez-faire economics long ago not counting the oligarchs , who treasure it . They would be happy to starve you . <p> The USA has not had totally free capitalism for a long time ; going back at least as far as the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 . Back then , it was obvious that huge combines of corporations had amassed too much power . <h> Anti-Trust Law Saved Steve Jobs , Apple Computer , and the Macintosh <p> And we are not just talking ancient history here . In 1997 , Microsoft was worried about anti-trust law when their last competitor , Apple Computer , was on the verge of bankruptcy . Bill Gates made a $150 million investment in Apple and saved Steve Jobs . In a pure laissez-faire system , Gates would have snuffed out Apple , and Steve Jobs would be remembered as a guy who made cartoons for Disney . ( Read more in this Seattle Times story from August 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Instead , the fear of government anti-trust action stayed Gatess hand , and few people would argue against how things turned out . Not even the most rabid of libertarians . <h> A Virtuous Circle of Evil <p> It is obvious from the case studies in our history that successful companies should not be allowed to create unregulated monopolies for themselves . However , we also have considerable evidence that anti-trust law is needed to remedy a flaw in human behavior itself . <p> Sixteen years after the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto proved that concentration of wealth is the normal outcome of a laissez-faire system . The rich do indeed get richer . It is literally a law of nature . ( See Part 4 for more discussion of Pareto . ) <p> To see how money begets money , and power begets power , imagine that you have a small business that is doing well . You have an idea for a new law that would help you take over your competitors . Do you have enough money to hire a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you afford a lobbyist to take it to the legislature in your state capitol , or Washington D.C. ? Maybe so , but can you then purchase enough politicians to vote for your law ? <p> Maybe not . Maybe you have to work harder and save more , or look for a loan . But what happens when you finally pull it off ? You wipe out your competitors , capture all the profits that they were making , and then raise prices for your newly-birthed monopoly . <p> And what happens after that ? Now you have enough money to deploy a small army of lawyers , lobbyists , congressmen , senators , and presidents . And you can conquer more markets . Eventually you buy newspapers , televisions stations , and movie studios who all sing your song . Maybe you even fund a think-tank and have scholars churning out papers " proving " that everything you do is " good for America " or " gods work . " <p> Ultimately , everybody realizes that they must kowtow to you because its the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you wield power over a multitude . <h> Closing the School of Hard Knocks <p> Competing in a free market is hard work , and most people appreciate that fact . That 's why entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs receive so much adoration because they got straight-As in the School of Hard Knocks . However , the aftertaste of the grueling curriculum stays with such people after graduation , and when they are in a position to make things easier for themselves , they readily do so . <p> The problem is that the more successful you are , the more competitors you attract . So , to get some relief from that never-ending pressure , your only choice is to undermine your competition via nefarious means means that must necessarily undermine the free-market itself because that is where your competitors are birthed . ( Economists call this " rent seeking . " ) <h> The Freedom to Thwart Freedom <p> And that 's why oligarchs love laissez-faire so much : it gives them ideological and moral cover to thwart free enterprise . The American ideal of free-enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ensuring that it stays level . Laissez-faire is the law of the jungle , with no referees , where might makes right . Barbarism , in short . <p> The admiration that our great business leaders receive is justified until they begin to engage in anti-competitive activities . Then they must be disciplined . <p> " In Jamaica , the plantation owners felt it made the most sense to extract the maximum possible effort from their human property while the property was still young to work their slaves until they were either useless or dead and then simply buy another round at the market . " <p> When laissez-faire economics is combined with restricted population growth , a middle class can be created . Workers are rare , so companies must pay them well . However , under overpopulated conditions , laissez-faire economics leads to dramatic income-inequality . Workers are a dime-a-dozen , so companies pay them subsistence wages , or worse , and people end up living in cages like in the worlds most libertarian city Hong Kong . Here is a frame from the " Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Americans are suckers for the Dark Art of mass immigration because we are almost completely a nation of immigrants , and the descendants of immigrants . So we are sympathetic to the plight of the " wretched refuse " as it says on the Statue of Liberty . <p> Yet , surely there must be some sort of limit on the rate at which we can absorb new immigrants , no ? Is it a coincidence that the Great Depression and the Great Recession both came after the two highest peaks of immigration in American history ? <p> With 11.8 million people unemployed , and 47 million on food stamps , do n't  we have some " wretched refuse " of our own to tend to ? <p> How many of the men in this picture from the Great Depression were immigrants ? : <p> Nobody knows , but chances are good that quite a few of them were foreigners because the Great Depression was preceded by a huge wave of immigration . The famous Dust Bowl farmers of the 1930s were largely immigrants . One could argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have happened with a more judicious immigration policy . <p> Thanks to propaganda-by-omission from the Oligarch Media , not many Americans realize that during the Great Recession we brought in record numbers of legal immigrants . Take a look at this chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> That 's right . Even when the unemployment rate went over 11% in 2009 , immigration kept on going full steam ahead . <p> These numbers are not insubstantial in relation to unemployment . We have 11.8 million people unemployed now ( FRED LNU03000000 ) . If we had merely been running immigration at our historical average of 400,000 per year over the last two or three decades , unemployment would n't even be an issue today . <p> Now , look at the " 1930 " bar on the chart . Its almost the smallest in history because during the Great Depression , the Roosevelt administration shut down immigration . It was just common sense ; we did n't  have jobs for new people . Or as they like to say in business , we did n't  need any more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same common sense in 2008 ? And what 's President Obamas excuse now ? <p> Answer : during the 1930s , the USA was a nation of the people , by the people , and for the people . And today we are a nation of the oligarchs , by the oligarchs , and for the oligarchs . <p> Corporate profits benefit from mass immigration because the increased supply of labor drives down business " costs " a.k.a. your paycheck . <p> Now , look at the decades when the mighty American middle class rose to power : the 1940s , 1950s , and 1960s were periods of low immigration . That is n't a coincidence . Whether or not this nation has a middle class is a policy choice . Back then , we deliberately created a middle class . Today , we are deliberately destroying it . <p> The vast wealth of the middle class is being converted into corporate profits via mass immigration , and wide-open free trade with low-wage nations which sucks entire industries out of the USA . <p> If the history books of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are today ) , the Great Recession will be recorded as the greatest betrayal of the American people in history . <h> Mass Immigration is Supported by All Three Major Political Parties <p> There is virtually no political opposition to legal mass immigration . It is a sacred cow of American politics , and the true scale of it is completely concealed by the mass media . <p> Libertarians have always had open borders as a pillar of their ideology . To them , only a police state would initiate force against an innocent person crossing a border . ( And nerdy libertarian men need to import mail-order brides . ) <p> Democrats have cheered on mass immigration as part of their campaign to dilute white , Republican voters . Bill Clinton gave the commencement address to the 1998 Portland State graduating class . Here are two quotes from the C-SPAN video : <p> At the 13:40 mark : " Each year , nearly a million people come legally to America . " <p> At the 14:08 mark : " In a little more than fifty years , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Clinton had to wait for the applause to die down after the second quote . Diluting the hillbilly , redneck , bible-thumping , red-state Republicans is sacred to the Democrats . Of course today , those applauding students probably live with their parents , have maxed-out credit cards , mounds of student-loan debt , and work as servers in restaurants , or as unpaid interns . <p> But why would the Republicans go along with mass immigration when the consensus was that it would weaken their partys ability to win elections ? This is where we see the Dark Arts in action . Its not about the Republican Party , its about the Oligarchy . <p> Mass immigration boosts the profits of big business , increases the power of the Oligarchy , and brings the return of sweatshops closer . So , the Republicans have been required to fall on their swords and they have done so cheerfully . As a matter of fact , Republican Senator Marco Rubio went so far as to say that his party should start bragging about mass immigration . On August 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3:24 mark of this video ) : <p> " We have to start by bragging about the fact that a million people a year immigrate to the United States legally . A million people . No other country comes close . " <p> Meanwhile , Rubios home state , Florida , had at that time over 3 million people on food stamps , which was more than California a state with double the population ! For Rubio , its not about Florida ; its about the Oligarchy . From the USDA ( click to enlarge ) : <p> During the Great Recession , President Obamas biggest problem was unemployment . And yet , he kept the flow of legal immigrants coming in at one million per year . That 's a policy that makes no sense for a president running for re-election but only if you are unaware of the Dark Arts . Obama will probably get an award for his obedient service to the Oligarchy in an Eyes Wide Shut type of secret ceremony . <h> Education Armageddon <p> Apple founder Steve Wozniak attended Californias De Anza College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( click to enlarge ) : <p> However , as profits soared at Apple , and other Silicon Valley companies , courses were cut and tuition was raised at De Anza . Yes , multinationals are notorious tax dodgers , but you would think that they would want to have the California educational system continue to crank out well-prepared workers for them . <p> Well , they do n't  . They will be just as happy getting their fresh bodies from India and China . Even happier , no doubt , since immigrants will work much cheaper than " uppity " Americans . <p> " I just do n't  understand it . Ill bet every person at Apple has a connection to De Anza . Their kids swim in our pool . Their cousins take classes here . They drive past it every day , for Petes sake . But then they do everything they can to pay as few taxes as possible . " <p> Oligarchs are not concerned with the tribulations of the small people scurrying about their feet . Do you worry about ants scurrying around your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave plantations werent enormously profitable just because they enslaved Africans . They were profitable because the cost of purchasing slaves was kept down by the mass immigration of slaves . It was n't voluntary immigration , of course , but the plantation system was nevertheless dependent upon a mass influx of fresh workers . <p> Think of a slave plantation , Foxconn gadget factory , or Walmart warehouse as an engine fueled with humans . If the supply of humans is too low , you have to run your engine at a slow speed . If you burn through the humans too fast , you wont have enough to man all of the workstations and the engine will stop . <p> Now imagine a huge ship sailing up to a nearby port , and thousands of fresh bodies marching off . Now you are free to crack the whip , rev up the engine , and accelerate profits because you now have access to all the fuel your human-burning engine can handle . <p> And indeed , Foxconn factories and Walmart warehouses have notoriously high turn-over rates . They just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of their employees . <h> Your Mother Was Wrong You 're Not Special <p> Here is a chart from the Census Bureau showing population by age and gender in Washington D.C. ( click to enlarge ) : <p> Notice that there are a lot more females than males in the 20-29 age group . That 's because the numerous office jobs in the federal bureaucracy are mainly staffed with women . The exact number of surplus women is 11,823 : <p> Washington D.C. Population Ages 20-29 <p> Single women in their twenties in Washington D.C. do n't  feel very special because its a " buyers market " for men . The situation is a lot different in Anchorage , Alaska . Up there , its the men who have to beg and plead for dates : <p> Anchorage , Alaska Population Ages 20-29 <p> If a woman wants to be a prima donna , taking a job in Washington is not a good strategy .

And American workers are experiencing just such a rude awakening right now . <p> The moral of the story is that how you are treated by other people is often determined by a simple numbers game . Mass immigration makes you less special economically , and increases the likelihood that you will be treated badly on the job . This writers mother reports that employers were very good to her during World War II . With all the men at war , and immigration still tight , employers had no choice but to be pleasant to their employees , and even treasure them as valued partners in the operation of the capitalist system . Shockingly , the world did not end , and corporations remained profitable . <h> Prepare to be Marched Upon by The Reserve Army of Labor <p> If you listen to an Oligarch talk for long enough , eventually , he will pound the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " This is their favorite demand , and they have their captive media blast it at you around the clock . You will see it in both flavors of the Oligarch Media , from Thomas L. Friedman in the New York Times , to Republican Larry Kudlow on CNBC . <p> Thomas L. Friedman lying about immigration on The McLaughlin Group . <p> In November 2011 , Friedman said on the McLaughlin Group ( transcript , video ) : <p> " We have a Republican debate : who can put up the most electric fences . The message is go away . " <p> Legal immigration to the USA in 2011 was 1,062,040 far more than any other nation on Earth . Hardly a " Keep Out " sign . Two weeks after Freidmans blatant lie , globalist Amy M. Wilkinson wrote this blatant lie on CNN.com : <p> " Ellis Island has put up a velvet rope line . To vital job generators , we are saying , " Theres no room for you . " <p> Far from a velvet rope , there are red carpets extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red carpets in American history ! While we may not have had a special visa for entrepreneur immigrants as Wilkinson proposed , surely there must have been a few such people sprinkled in among the 10.5 million legal immigrants of the prior decade . As a matter of fact , we probably brought in more entrepreneur immigrants than all other nations of the world combined . <p> And yet , poverty and unemployment still exploded during that period . Funny how that worked outAfter all , if immigrants were the magical creatures that the Oligarch Media portrays them to be , then we should have jobs coming out of our ears by now . <p> " Labor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration . " <p> -Abraham Lincoln . <p> Even workplaces that have not been offshored , or staffed with foreigners , have been under pressure from the Dark Arts . After all , just because you cant eliminate an American worker does n't  mean that you cant work her like an Alaskan sled dog . <p> Union-busting itself is not a Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers , but it is nevertheless a pillar of the Oligarchys system . Eliminating unions is a classic divide-and-conquer strategy , leaving workers to fend for themselves in the laissez-faire jungle , hunted by the Oligarchys wolf-packs . <p> Suppose that you work in a warehouse as a " picker . " Your job is to fetch books from the racks and hand them off to a " packer . " The warehouse is large , so you have to do a lot of walking . How fast do you go ? <p> Before you answer that question , you might want to ask : how many job applicants are there in the waiting room clutching their resumes ? If there are a hundred people wanting your job , then you might feel the need to hustle . If the waiting room is empty , then maybe you do n't  feel any urgency . When your supervisor rolls up behind you in his golf cart , and yells : " Mush ! Mush ! " you just ignore him . He ca n't fire you because he can not replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if you do n't  , then he wont be any worse off by firing you but he cant make you sweat . <p> The key element in making a sweatshop run smoothly is to have a surplus of workers standing by because it instills fear . In general , the greater the surplus , the more fascist your boss can act due to your fear of being fired . <h> Foxconns Evil American Twin <p> Once the Reserve Army of Labor has been constructed with mass immigration , the process of monetizing surplus humans into fat profits for the Oligarchy can begin . For example , 65% of the cost of operating a warehouse is labor . So , large profits can indeed be made by sweating the workers . And the warehouse industry ( " logistics " ) is bigger than ever . Since we have offshored so many factories , we now need much larger facilities for distributing the products that come over from Asia . In a just society , blue-collar workers laid off from well-paid factory jobs would land on their feet with well-paid logistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , factory workers have gone from the frying pan and into the fire . American warehouse workers are being made to sweat today ; just like workers in China and Mexico . Journalist Mac McClelland has a friend " Susie " who works as a warehouse manager ( story here ) <p> " Susie told me its pretty dispiriting to act as though her workers are as disposable as the products they 're shipping . But that 's just the way it is , she said . The logistics clients are n't  interested in spending money on a better or more sustainable work culture . Nor do they need to . There are 100 people employed in the warehouse I visited , and Susie could fire every one of them today without costing her bosses a dime of lost profits . She has applications from hundreds of people ready to take the job . " <p> In 2011 , McClelland took a job in a warehouse to observe working conditions firsthand . In " I Was a Warehouse Wage Slave " she reported that during the hiring process , a manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fired . His offense ? He had to take a day off while his wife delivered a baby . McClelland was callously worked like a dog : <p> " Theres a screaming pain running across the back of my shoulders . " You need to take 800 milligrams of Advil a day , " a woman in her late 50s or early 60s advised me when we all congregated in the break room before work . " <p> And : <p> " I pick 300 items . The majority of them zap me painfully . " <p> Instead of using an anti-static coating on the shelves , the warehouse just inflicts constant static-electricity shocks on workers . <p> And it is not just labor activists and journalists who are reporting abuses . In 2011 , " The Morning Call " newspaper in Allentown reported : <p> " An emergency room doctor in June called federal regulators to report an " unsafe environment " after he treated severalwarehouse workers for heat-related problems . The doctors report was echoed by warehouse workers who also complained to regulators , including a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The workers got to the emergency room courtesy of ambulances that the warehouse had standing by . They knew workers would be dropping . <p> When pregnant women are worked like dogs until they need to be hauled to the emergency room , you know you are no longer living in a civilized society you are living in an oligarchy . <p> Of course , these egregious warehouse conditions are premeditated . These facilities are designed from the ground up as sweatshops . It is a cold , calculated " chew them up and spit them out " system designed to burn through the Reserve Army of Labor as if workers were so many logs being fed through a sawmill . <p> A mirror image of the head-end of the system the sweatshops in China . <p> And that is not a coincidence . The entire global system has been painstakingly architected by multinational corporations for the sole purpose of increasing profits . We will discuss this further in " The Restoration of Slavery " section below . Of course , American warehouse workers , and Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . <h> Flipperized <p> American factory jobs are being " flipperized , " to coin a term . Cindy Estrada , UAW VP told Manufacturing and Technology News ( July 2012 ) that a unionized American Axle plant in Three Rivers , Michigan : <p> " used to have a food bank for other workers in the community who werent in the union . Today , the food bank is only for workers in the plant because the new hourly wage rate there is $11 an hour . " <p> $11 per hour is $23,000 per year . A middle class income is between $39,000-$115,000 . So , even unionized factory workers are n't  much better off than burger-flippers . <h> Not So Hospitable <p> Once upon a time , it used to be possible to enter the lower rung of the middle class via a hospitality job as a housekeeper or a bellman , for example . Not anymore . <p> " Hotel workers in Indianapolis say their workloads have increased in recent years while their wages have remained flat or even fallen . In some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms as they were just a few years ago , often working off the clock to meet their quota and avoid being disciplined . As the cost of living has climbed , they find themselves worse off than they were a decade ago . " <p> In 2009 , Hyatt fired 100 of its housekeepers in Boston , and replaced them with temps . <p> " The wages for housekeepers dropped from about $15 per hour with benefits to around $8 without benefits " <p> Temp agencies are widely used in the warehouse industry , and elsewhere , to beat down wages . The Hyatt story caused a good deal of outrage leading the nearby city of Cambridge to outlaw such outsourcing . <p> While warehouses are notorious for tracking workers electronically , Disney-hotel laundry workers have named a similar such system the " electronic whip . " Again , pregnant women are not given special consideration . From the Los Angeles Times : <p> " the whip has led to a sort of competition among workers , some of whom have tried to race to the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other employees worry that a reasonable pace wont be enough to keep the boss happy . " <p> Does a corporation with billions of dollars in profits really need to set its laundry workers at each others throats like this ? <p> Do n't  be silly ! Of course they do ! That 's where the extra billions come from ! If they did n't  , how would this be possible ? : <p> " when Walt Disney ran the company in 1966 , he made 108 times as much as one of his hotel housekeepers . Bob Iger , the current chief executive , makes 781 times as much as a housekeeper . " <p> There are numerous other examples that could be listed here . If you follow the links above , you will find more links , and can read stories for hours and hours maybe even days and days . Its a horror scene out there a seething caldron of oligarchy . <p> Degrading working conditions is a Dark Art , not only because it is a direct frontal assault on the middle class , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't  see chain gangs marched through town . If you drive by a warehouse , factory , or hotel , how can you know how hard the workers inside are being pushed , or how much they are being paid ? And how do the working conditions compare to those of , say , 1975 ? Since this information will never be accurately portrayed in the Oligarch Media , citizens must seek out the writings of journalists , labor activists , and historians . Consequently , when a multinational reports billions in profits , the majority of Americans have no idea how it was done . The gloating CEOs flying around in their shiny new jets neglect to tell us how many more workers are sporting the corporate jackboot on their necks . <p> All of the preceding Dark Arts discussed are amplified and prolonged by what future historians will surely brand as the worst economic policy in American history : The dollar/yuan currency peg . <p> If you took a survey asking Americans : " what is the top factor keeping our economy weak , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg . Yet , this arcane topic is the linchpin that keeps the tidal wave of factories and jobs flowing from the USA to China . ( Note : the Chinese currency is also called the " renminbi . " ) <p> Suppose that you own a factory and you are thinking about moving it to China . You look at the cost of shipping your machine tools over there , the amount of bribes you will have to pay to Chinese officials , the intellectual property that you will have to surrender , wages for Chinese workers , how much it will cost to ship your widgets back to the USA , etc . <p> While those are all important factors , you must also consider the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chinese yuan . Think of it like this , when you sell your widgets to your American customers , you receive dollars . Then you must reorder stock from the factory in China , but before you do that you must convert your dollars into yuan . You have to pay your workers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you need local currency to do that . <p> So , the exchange rate becomes vital to your profitability . For example , if the dollar weakens against the yuan , then from your perspective , the price of everything in China just went up . And what if the yuan strengthened to the point that your factory was no longer profitable ? You would have to start thinking about moving it back to the USA . <p> With that perspective , it is easy to see that in order for the Chinese to keep the flow of factories and jobs coming their way , they need to keep their currency weak versus the dollar . And that is exactly what they have done . Now , think about all the multinationals that have moved factories to China . The last thing that GE wants to do is move lightbulb plants from China back to Ohio that would be expensive . <p> So , both the communist regime in Beijing and the multinationals have the same incentive : to keep the dollar strong against the yuan . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , senators , treasury secretaries , and presidents to do just that . <p> As you can see , the dynamic is to keep the " terms of trade " tilted in favor of China . Once this type of flow begins , it is almost impossible to stop because the beneficiaries reap huge profits . Sweatshops are very profitable compared to American factories , and China has accrued trillions of dollars in their bank account . So have the multinationals . <p> And that 's how the USA lost its sovereignty : vast amounts of wealth were transferred from middle-class households to Beijing and the multinationals , which use that wealth to purchase more-and-more favorable legislation . <p> While many multinational corporations grew up in the USA , it is wrong to think of them as American companies now . The fact is that they impose legislation on Washington that favors themselves and the Chinese . <p> The Chinese have been weakening their currency versus the U.S. dollar for over 30 years ( click to enlarge ) : <p> One of the sharp moves down was in January 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when NAFTA went into effect , and the Chinese were trying to compete with a new large-scale competitor for multinational sweatshops : Mexico . On that day , Beijing cut the price of the yuan from 17.2- to 11.5- a massive 33% . <p> At that time , suppose that you had a factory in China employing 100 workers per shift , and you were paying them 10 yuan per hour , which was a very generous $1.72 . In the spreadsheet below , you can see that you would have been paying $1,376 per eight-hour shift before the devaluation . And afterward , only $920 . <p> Now , suppose that you were running three shifts per day , six days per week . Beijing would have put an extra $426,816 in your pocket in 1994 ! All through the " magic " of currency devaluation . So , its easy to see why the multinationals do n't  permit Washington to do anything about the peg its a gold mine for them . <p> Back on the chart , notice the unnaturally flat periods : that 's the currency peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only keeps the factories coming , but it also sends a message to the multinationals : " we are committed to keeping your operations profitable . " <p> Without the peg , moving a factory to China would be much more risky . Factory owners would be more hesitant , and the playing field would be more level . With the peg , the risk is removed , and the playing field is tilted downward toward China . <p> The yuan currency peg is the linchpin of the whole globalization criminal cartel . <p> How do the Chinese keep the exchange rate steady ? If their currency strengthens against the dollar , the Peoples Bank of China ( PBOC ) just prints up more yuan , goes into the currency market , and starts buying dollars . That increased demand pushes the dollar back up versus the yuan . When it gets back up to the peg , the PBOC stops buying . <p> Maintaining the peg is mechanically easy , though it is not without consequences : printing a lot of fresh currency can create inflation . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Federal Reserve Bank began their second " quantitative easing " ( QE2 ) stimulus program . The Chinese knew that if the USA tried to stimulate its economy with fresh dollars , they would have to print more yuan to buy those dollars in order to continue imposing their currency peg on the USA . <p> And that 's exactly what they did . The PBOC printed up mountains of fresh yuan and bought up the fresh dollars . They withdrew the stimulus that the Fed injected , the US economy barely improved , and inflation took off in China causing a good deal of strife as food prices shot up . <p> In a lecture to a class at George Washington University in March 2012 , Chairman Bernanke said as much . As reported by the New York Times : <p> " Mr. Bernanke said that history was clearly on the side of flexible policy . In particular , he described the standard view among economic historians that the rigidity of the gold standard amplified the Great Depression . He noted that the policies of modern nations tying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same downside . He cited the example of China , which maintains the value of its currency in relation to the dollar . Fixed exchange rates between countries tend to transmit both good and bad policies between countries and take away the independence those countries have to manage their economic policy , Mr. Bernanke said . " <p> The Chinese have indeed taken away our independence . Through their mostly-Republican lackeys , Beijing and the multinationals put a huge amount of pressure on the Fed to cancel their plans for QE2 . However , the Fed is one of the few remaining sovereign institutions in Washington , and defied the pressure . That was a heartening development for patriotic Americans , but ultimately the Chinese were able to rob the USA of the growth that QE2 would have stimulated . So , while the Fed still wields sovereign powers , Beijing is now powerful enough to neutralize those powers . <p> As catastrophic as the Dark Arts are , they are virtually unknown to the American public thanks to the Dark Art of Secrecy , Deception , and Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media ( MSM ) . However , its effectiveness as a propaganda machine is incredible . It is so effective that it is able to brainwash members of the Oligarchy itself ! In 2010 , President Obama announced a plan to boost the economy by increasing exports . On September 16 , 2010 , CNBC anchor and Council on Foreign Relations member Erin Burnett asked a guest : <p> " Could you give a few tangible exports , of the things , whether it be iPads , or whatever it is , that were going to be exporting so much more of ? " <p> Burnett had no clue that the manufacturing of our computers and electronics had been moved offshore years prior . And she goes to the secret meetings ! <p> What is truly amazing is that the MSM is able to accomplish such feats of mind-control in the face of the internet . Few things remain hidden these days , but they do indeed remain obscure , and therefore hidden from the masses for all practical intents and purposes . <p> If you could tell the proverbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from jumping out before it is boiled , you might say : " Do n't  worry ; no action needs to be taken . There is an invisible hand that guides the economy such that progress is automatic . So , just remain calm and everything will be fine . These uncomfortable conditions will soon pass . " This is essentially what the MSM does . Sure , they might discuss the increasing heat in the pot , but they rarely discuss the fire , or what fuels it . <p> The Chinese sweatshop-cat is out of the bag now , but Erin Burnett was clueless in 2010 because she was a victim of propaganda by omission . <h> Propaganda by Omission <p> Another example : everybody knows that U.S. Navy Seal Team Six killed Osama Bin Laden . However , many people are unaware that the Taliban got revenge . On August 6 , 2011 , a little more than a month after the Bin Laden raid , 22 members of Seal Team Six were killed in a Taliban ambush . <p> And yet , the worst defeat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely , if ever , mentioned even when the Bin Laden raid is discussed . The media reported the story when it happened , but then " forgot " about it . <p> This is an excellent example of the Dark Art of " Propaganda by Omission . " The fact that the Taliban exacted a measure of revenge tarnishes the Bin Laden victory . President Obama did a lot of bragging during the 2012 presidential campaign , and his strategy would have had less impact if the media continued mentioning the Talibans revenge . <p> However , the Republicans also stopped mentioning the ambush . They could have used the story to try to deflate Obamas bragging , but they did not . The military-industrial complex makes a lot of money on war and " nation building . " So by scrubbing the story from both the right- and left wings of the media , they are continuing to deliver a propaganda message : " Everything is just fine . There is no need to pull out like we did in Vietnam . In fact , things are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so disappeared one of the biggest stories of the war . In this case , both political factions of the Oligarchy had a motive to bury the story . And since repetition is necessary for learning , it was easy to do . You will see this often : the media will report a story distasteful to the Oligarchy to maintain credibility with the masses . But then they never mention it again effectively erasing it from the memories of their audience . <p> By observing what the Oligarchy suppresses , we can discover the planks of their secret party platform . Huge stories lacking commensurate coverage are blatant smoking guns : <h> Smoking Gun of Secrecy #1 : Invisible Immigration <p> During the Great Recession , the fact that legal immigration was continued at a record pace was rarely , if ever , discussed in the media . That 's a mind-numbing smoking gun . <p> The media did a seemingly infinite number of stories about unemployment , poverty , and illegal immigration , but somehow the fact that one million legal immigrants per year were pouring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Big Lie " propaganda that would win the approval of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels . <h> Smoking Gun of Secrecy #2 : Sweatshop Conditions <p> Americans knew that their jobs were going to China , but the media kept quiet about the brutal working conditions in Asian sweatshops for quite a while . The masses had a vague memory of the Cathy Lee Gifford incident , but it took the suicides of Foxconn workers on the Apple assembly lines for the story to come out a full decade after China was admitted into the World Trade Organization . <h> Smoking Gun of Secrecy #3 : IBMs Project Lean <p> If you Google IBMs Project Lean , you wo n't find any stories from the Oligarch Media . IBM is one of the nations largest employers , and the fact that it is replacing thousands of middle-class American workers with impoverished Indians is simply not discussed . At all . <h> Smoking Gun of Secrecy #4 : Invisible Factories <p> Many American multinationals do n't  list global plant locations on their websites . They do n't  want you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't  want you to know how much offshoring they have done . However , the people have fought back , and a good deal of this information can now be found on websites like Wikipedia . <h> Smoking Gun of Secrecy #5 : Suppression of NAFTA Criticism <p> Ross Perot said that during his campaign against NAFTA in the early 1990s , the big TV networks would not run his ads . He had to buy time on many small , local stations ( see Part 3 below ) . <p> Those are just a few examples , an entire book could be written just on this one aspect of The Oligarchys operations . Like Morpheus said in The Matrix : " The matrix is a computer-generated dream-world built to keep us under control " 10 And indeed , Americans are being kept in a feel-good dream world as the Oligarchy brazenly advances its campaign of eradicating the middle class . But it was n't always like that . In fact , the news media used to be a huge thorn-in-the-side for the Oligarchy . <h> How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the " liberal " Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) , but few people realize that PBS was founded to promote the Vietnam War . 11 In the 1960s , television rose to power , and its news journalists were very critical of the war . So , President Lyndon Johnson set up PBS and made Frank Pace , Jr . chairman . Pace was a former Secretary of the Army , and a former CEO of General Dynamics Corporation , a huge defense contractor . And so PBS was born as an appendage of the military-industrial complex . But that was n't good enough . <p> Resistance to the Vietnam War continued . David Rockefeller himself triggered protests when he went to Saigon in 1966 to open a new branch of his Chase-Manhattan Bank . Eventually , the people and their crusading television journalists , forced the Oligarchy to end the war . And the Oligarchy was not pleased . In fact , they were incensed . In the very same year that Saigon fell to the NVA , 1975 , David Rockefellers Trilateral Commission vowed revenge . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published the report/book , " The Crisis of Democracy On the Governability of Democracies " which can be downloaded from Trilateral.org here . The report is a long and whiny diatribe about the loss of " social control . " They were especially apoplectic over intellectual journalists criticizing Establishment policies in front of large television audiences . So , the people can indeed make the Oligarchy sweat . <p> The gloves come off on page 181 in the section titled " Restoring a Balance between Government and Media " where the report demanded that journalists pipe down , or face government regulation of their content . The report also advocated repealing the 1966 Freedom of Information Act , and making reporters subject to prosecution for libel when they criticized government officials . However , the Oligarchys resolve ran deeper , and darker . <h> A-B-CIA <p> One of the most famous corporate takeovers in history occurred in 1985 , when a little fish called Capital Cities Communications swallowed a whale the American Broadcasting Company . Fishy , no ? At the time , ABC was more profitable than its rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management invited the takeover . And ABCs CEO Leonard H. Goldenson was , according to Fortune , " beset by suitors for decades " and " ruled with ferocious independence for over 30 years . " So , if ABC was a fiercely independent , profitable whale , how did a little minnow like Capital Cities take it over ? Answer : the fix was in . <p> Capital Cities was founded in 1954 by several men with Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) connections . The companys lawyer was William J. Casey who went on to become Ronald Reagans CIA director for six years . Casey is reputed to have invented the tax shelter for Capital Cities . The company also used its government connections to learn the direction of Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) policy , which enabled them to buy and sell the right media properties kind of like buying-up land before a new highway is built . <p> Those corrupt connections and tax evading , combined with a brutal union-busting attitude , won a reputation of managerial " genius " for Capital Cities CEO Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . And why wouldnt they ? With connections like that , the company couldnt fail to make huge profits . Capital Cities could have been the " poster boy " for the Oligarchy , and the Oligarchy wanted to muzzle televisions journalists . <p> On November 21 , 1984 , CIA Director Casey asked the FCC to revoke ABCs television- and radio-station broadcast licenses because of a story that ABC did that was critical of the CIA . While FCC Director , James Quello , a former Capital Cities station manager , considered the request , ABC cracked under the pressure and agreed to be taken over by Capital Cities . 12 <p> At the time , Casey owned 34,000 shares of Capital Cities stock . He should have put the stock into his blind trust along with his other stocks since he was a public official , but he did not . If he had done so , the manager of the trust could have sold the Capital Cities shares at any time without Casey knowing . So obviously , Casey wanted to make sure that he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming for the stock , and he eventually made several million dollars on his investment . <p> So , the " big bang " of media concentration exploded out of a swamp of shady characters . Is it any surprise that todays news media is widely regarded as a whitewashing machine for multinational corporations ? <h> Buffett Wets His Beak <p> Being a much smaller company than ABC , Capital Cities needed to borrow money to execute the takeover . So , Murphy brought in his old friend , Warren Buffett who invested $518 million in exchange for 18% of the new , combined company . Buffetts name rarely comes up in conspiracy circles , so his role is very interesting . During an interview at the Harvard Business School , Murphy said that he had invited Buffett to join the board of directors of Capital Cities fifteen years prior , and Buffett had refused . Was Buffett resisting being recruited into the cabal ? <p> Buffett is also famous for being a follower of the conservative investor Benjamin Gramm and said about the deal : " I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 13 Buffett invested an incredible 25% of his companys liquid assets in the deal . Of course , Caseys threats against ABC were public knowledge , and Buffett was pals with Murphy , so Buffett almost certainly knew that the fix was in , and the deal did turn out to be hugely profitable for him . <p> Buffett might have been persuaded by Murphys track record of brutal labor crackdowns . The deal was expensive by Buffetts usual standards , but there was no doubt that Murphy would be lopping off heads at ABC after the takeover . So , there was a " sure thing " type of strategy that may have sweetened the deal for Buffett . This is reminiscent of Buffetts $10.7 billion investment in IBM in 2012 . Perhaps union-busting , and labor arbitrage are causes for which Buffett is willing to make exceptions to his strict investing philosophy . Read more about Buffetts IBM investment below . <h> Disney Buys Capital Cities/ABC <p> In 1994 , The Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cites/ABC . Today , Disney is a component of the Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the largest media company in the world . It was a good fit ; Disney has played ball with the Oligarchy going all the way back to the days when Walt Disney was an FBI informant feeding information to J. Edgar Hoover . <h> Legacy <p> ABC became the most right-wing of the television networks , and hosted Rush Limbaugh in their radio studios . Limbaugh argued for the concept that since the Constitution designated the President as Commander in Chief that he could command the armed forces to do whatever he wanted ; that he was , in fact , a military dictator . And it was n't long before the Oligarchy got their perpetual war machine going again . This is not a partisan issue ; it is an issue of Constitutional law . Republicans should support the Constitutions requirement that wars be declared by Congress . <p> In 2011 , Occupy Wall Street protestors rushed into the streets , but famously could n't think of any demands . After all , they had grown up with the Oligarch Media , and consequently , their brains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended . <p> In 2012 , Disney released the film " The Avengers " which is based on the comic book series of the same name . In the film , the superheroes work with the SHIELD agency , which is a global intelligence organization . At the 35:24 mark , as they are trying to catch the bad guys , SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson says : <p> So , there 's Disney doing a bit of brainwashing on us ; trying to make it look like total surveillance through consumer electronics is a good thing . <p> In 1975 , we had dozens of media corporations . Today , in the wake of the Oligarchys media-concentration project , most media are owned by a handful of mega-corporations like Disney ( ABC ) , AOL-Time Warner , Viacom ( CBS ) , General Electric ( NBC ) , News Corporation ( Fox ) , Sony , etc . <p> For a detailed history of the Capital Cities story , see Networks of Power by Dennis Mazzocco . <p> The Crisis of Democracy is also the book that contains the infamous " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the problems of governance in the United States today stem from an excess of democracy " <p> So , a democratic system is okay until it gets too democratic . Then it will fly out of control unless rescued by " some outside agency " meaning a swell group of guys like Rockefeller and his Trilateralist pals . The " agency " quote ( from page 8 ) is fascinating because that 's exactly how they resolved the " problem " with the Central Intelligence Agency kicking things off by helping Capital Cities take over ABC . <h> Corporate Public Relations <p> Multinational corporations are exactly like the " Mom " character in the Futurama animated television series . In public , Mom is the benevolent , elderly CEO of MomCorp . Sort of the female version of Warren Buffett . As the Futuramawebsite says : <p> " Mom owns one of the biggest corporations in the universe . To most she seems to be a sweet old lady , but those close to her know shes evil . " <p> In public , Mom wears a fat suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leaves the public eye , Mom takes off her matronly costume and parades around in a super-villain style cat-suit , like Catwoman , but with wrinkles : <p> In real life , companies like Disney project a wholesome image , while behind the scenes , downtrodden sweatshop workers in Third-World countries like Haiti and Bangladesh churn out Disney merchandise for minuscule wages under horrific working conditions . And laundry workers in Disney hotels are driven like so many sled dogs . How many stories about that do you think you will see on the ABC network , which is owned by Disney ? <p> Today every multinational has a " public relations " department staffed with attractive , bubbly women whose job it is to convince you that the company is a model corporate citizen . But did you know that " public relations " was once called " propaganda " ? <p> Edward Bernays , " the father of public relations " coined the term for peace-time use in the USA after the Germans started using " propaganda " and gave it a bad name . The Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with that was , ironically , bad propaganda for American companies , and so they switched to the " public relations " moniker . <h> Meme Seeding <p> In the early days of corporate propaganda , there were rather blatant publicity stunts , celebrities hired to shill products , fake stories planted in the news , etc . Then a more sophisticated approach was developed that we might designate as " meme seeding . " Memes are ideas that take on a life of their own , spreading from brain-to-brain like a virus . They are sort of like the " trial balloons " that politicians use to test support for their ideas , however meme seeding is designed to shape minds , not poll them . <p> To use a meme to win people over to your plan , you must first craft an appealing idea . Then you must inject it into other human brains , ideally through the mass media , and you might do that by sponsoring news stories , television shows , music , etc . You do n't  pitch a product directly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch . <p> So , if the Oligarchy were , for example , planning to conquer Venezuela , they might release a " meme swarm " by tasking their media corporations to produce anti-Venezuelan content years in advance . Perhaps you would see a heart-rending documentary about poor Venezuelan children . Or a story about deforestation , or a shocking tell-all book by one of President Hugo Chavezs relatives . By time the war drums started to beat , you might have already passively absorbed a negative view of the target . <p> One of the effects of " synergy " between different media outlets owned by the same corporation is that it extends the reach of their meme swarms . If you do n't  watch their television stations , you might be infected by one of their radio stations , magazines , books , websites , or celebrities on Twitter . <h> Philanthropic Propaganda <p> Even seemingly benign campaigns are suspect . For example , in the 1960s , the American people were treated to a blitz of Latin American culture . Latin artists , writers , and musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a good thing in itself . However , the organization was David Rockefellers " Center for Inter-American Relations " ( CIAR ) . From his Memoirs ( Kindle 8603 ) : <p> " From the beginning the councils membership included many of the countrys largest and most important corporations , representing about 90 percent of U.S. investment in Latin America . " <p> The American people never wanted to send their jobs south of the border , so the CIARs cultural blitz was a propaganda weapon used to soften-up their attitudes long before NAFTA came up for a vote in Congress . <h> You are Getting SleepyVery Sleepy <p> You , as an American , swim like a fish in a sea of corporate propaganda . With most of the media owned by a handful of corporations , it is nearly impossible to escape . Maybe you will remember some of the things in this book ten years from now , but its more likely that you will forget all of it , and be re-brainwashed . Its human nature to take as fact things that you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy are critical because if the true nature of the Oligarchy were known to the public , there would be a revolution . To get a better feel for what we are dealing with , imagine that you are an up-and-coming psychopath CEO with a heart of stone : <h> Think Like a Greedy , Globalist Psychopath <p> Not all capitalists are oligarchs . How can you tell the difference ? Its actually very easy . An honest capitalist operates his business in accordance with the laws of the United States of America . In contrast , an oligarch believes that he is above the law . An oligarch believes that might makes right and that he is justified in eradicating large chunks of American sovereignty by lobbying and bribing Congress . <p> A sovereign nation is a nation that is able to control its borders ; to keep out unwanted goods , people , and armies . A nation that does not control its borders is like a " gated " community that leaves its gates open , and employs no security guards . The whole point of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dangerous world . But an oligarch does n't  think that way . He thinks of himself as a god floating above nation-states , and will cheerfully do harm to his neighbors when there is money or power to be gained . <p> An oligarch sneers at sovereignty . An oligarch will fight hard to get NAFTA passed so that he can fire all of his U.S. workers and move his factory down to Mexico . An oligarch will fight to get work visas to bring in large numbers of workers so that he can replace his " uppity " American citizen workers . Oligarchs act like psychopaths with no regard whatsoever for he well-being of their homeland . <p> Experts estimate that psychopaths comprise 1% of the population , so the USA likely has about 3 million psychopaths . Experts also say that psychopaths are adept at climbing the corporate ladder . How many oligarchs are also psychopaths ? Nobody knows , but when you see clean , safe , efficient , well-paying American factories being converted into brutal Asian sweatshops , you must assume that the psychopaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking . What goes through their minds as they are doing so ? <p> Imagine that you are a psychopath and run a business in a small rural town . You have 10 employees whom you pay $50,000 per year each . Like most businesses , these labor costs are your largest expense . What if you could lower that $500,000 per-year payroll expense by a factor of ten , to only $5,000 per head ? Then you could pocket another $450,000 per year , and add another yacht to your flotilla . <p> But how do you pull it off ? How do you convince your workers to work for $2 per hour instead of $25 ? Well , whatever you do , you have to do it quietly , because if your workers knew what you were up to , they would either do you bodily harm , or walk out causing your business to collapse . <p> So , you adopt a policy of secrecy and deception . But what about those pesky business reporters ? What if they catch on to your machinations and write an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy up the local newspaper , radio station , and TV station . If there are laws against such control of the media , you would , of course , need to bribe the requisite politicians to abolish those " excess government regulations . " <p> Once that is done , you are poised for a sneak attack , but which tactics do you use ? First , the minimum wage is much higher than $2 per hour , so you hire a lobbyist to start campaigning for the repeal of state and federal minimum-wage laws . That wont be easy , so you also set up a think-tank , staff it with scribblers , and set them to work producing libertarian propaganda . You flood the town with content singing the praises of laissez-faire capitalism , and how the unemployment problem could be solved by letting wages fall to their " equilibrium " level , etc . <p> Converting your workers and the townspeople into libertarians may take a long time , so you need another pincer in your attack . What if you could bring in some impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will work for less than minimum wage and not rat you out to the authorities ? Sounds like a dream , right ? So , you send a memo to your think-tank to write some essays on the glories of unrestricted immigration , and publish them in your captive media . <p> Then , to fireproof yourself against lawsuits , you look for a temp agency who will officially employ the immigrants . You will be hiring the agency , and not have any " official " knowledge of their status or how much they are paid . So , the temp agency will be your " fall guy " in any future dust-up between your criminal operation and the authorities , who do n't  always stay bribed . <p> The townspeople , like most Americans , are against mass immigration , so you need to attack on even more fronts in case your temp agency ca n't round up enough bodies . What if you could move your widget factory to Mexico where paying workers $2 per hour is perfectly legal ? That would be a cinch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , you direct your minions to embark upon a " free trade " campaign . Battle lines are opened up along the usual fronts : in the legislature , in the media , and in academia . Suddenly , " intellectuals " are haranguing the town with tales about how tariffs caused the Great Depression , etc . <p> Your employees live in a nice , middle-class neighborhood , pay property taxes , spend money patronizing other local business , take vacations , and put their children through college . All of which infuriates you . Who do these uppity Americans think they are ? Do n't  they know that they are just a commodity and could be replaced like that by any of a billion Chinese or Indians ? Why do you have to pay them inflated salaries to support public services that you do n't  need ? You do n't  send your children to their pedestrian public schools . You do n't  need their Keystone Cop police force to protect you when you have your own security force of ex-Marines . And what do their children need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be shortly working in sweatshops like the rest of the globes superfluous masses ? <p> You have survived the Darwinian process of the free-market , and by definition , you are " the fittest . " The fittest to decide , to manage , to rule . These uppity , overpaid , middle-class workers should worship a " job creator " such as yourself as you go about doing " gods work , " which can only benefit the " small people . " How dare they presume to regulate your behavior ? <p> And if they wont worship you , they can be made to beg , grovel , and cringe for jobs . When there are thousands of applicants for every position you have , you will be in your glory ; dictating terms to the pathetic plebs crying for inclusion in your gloriously satanic mills . <p> Or so you dream . In reality , you will have to patiently construct a vast matrix to lull the people into complacency , rewrite laws , bribe politicians , etc . Militants , such as labor unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or preferably , shot in the head . But ultimately , your plan is feasible because Americans believe in " freedom " and can be tricked into accepting your version of it . <p> Secrecy and deception are critical to your cause because you are a truly evil psychopath who will cheerfully enslave children in brutal sweatshops and slave plantations . And that , obviously , needs to be sugar-coated while the people are still in a position to fight back . <p> The American military empire is no exception to Stalins principle . However , we do have a different imperialistic style . We are less ham-fisted than the antecedent British Empire , or the defeated Soviet Empire . And that 's because the Pentagons mission is to make the world safe for globalization . <p> Imagine if you moved your factory to China , produced a batch of widgets , loaded them onto a container ship , and sent them off to the Port of Los Angeles . And then a few days later , your ship was seized by the Philippine Navy in reparation for the money embezzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos . <p> How would you like that ? And if you knew that was a possibility , would you have ever moved your factory to China in the first place ? Probably not , right ? <p> But you do n't  have to worry , because the U.S. Navy keeps the sea lanes safe for globalization . We have more aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combined , not to mention air bases all over the globe . Nobody would dare seize your ship ( not counting Somali pirates ) . And there is no charge to you . This first-class security service is provided by the same worker/taxpayers who you fired when you moved your plant to China ! <p> From this perspective , we can see that much of our military expenditures are a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the Oligarchy . <p> Libertarians like to argue that insurance could replace the security provided by the U.S. Navy . So , if the Filipinos seized your ship , you would collect your insurance claim , order another batch of widgets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers might get out of the habit of shopping in your widget store because the last time they came in , your shelves were bare . And insurance is n't free ; the cost might itself defeat the whole idea of offshoring . <p> While it may not seem like pirates could do much damage to mighty export nations like China and Germany , the fact is that the worlds seas contain many choke-points . From geopolitical expert George Friedman : <p> " The world is filled with choke-points , where the ocean narrows and constricts the flow of ships into corridors within range of land-based anti-ship systems . Some choke-points , such as the Strait of Hormuz , the Strait of Malacca and the Strait of Gibraltar , are natural , while others , such as the Panama and Suez canals , are man-made , and they are vulnerable to weapons far less sophisticated than anti-ship missiles . These choke-points , as well as other critical coastal waters , represent the vulnerabilities of the global economic system to state and non-state actors . Occupying them is the logical next step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy in the vicinity , the puny pirates of Somalia do nearly $7 billion per year in damage to global shipping , not to mention kidnapping and killing people too . <p> The fact is that a large percentage of the profits made from globalization by export nations like China , Germany , Japan , South Korea , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , etc. are made possible by U.S. taxpayers . <p> You might think that it would be easy to just arm cargo ships and tankers so that they could fight off pirates . However , that is another expense in arms , crew training , and insurance . It is also something that most ports do not permit . The Port of Miami is only one mile away from downtown Miami : <p> A ship armed with even modest weapons could do quite a lot of damage to civilians . Even a sniper with just his rifle could hit the oligarchs themselves in their condos on Fisher Island as the ship sails by within shouting distance : <p> Arming merchant ships is not impossible , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary function is to make the world safe for globalization is not just this writers opinion ; there is clear-cut evidence . For example , if we conquered Iraq to fight terrorism , eradicate weapons of mass destruction , or to free the Iraqi people from a despot , then why did we impose our body of law governing agriculture on Iraqi farmers ? What , may I ask , do seeds have to do with Al Qaeda ? And who gave L. Paul Bremer , the guy we put in charge of Iraq , the idea for his Order 81 which changed Iraqi law ? Could it have been Monsanto lobbyists ? <p> " In Iraq , the groundwork has been laid to protect the patents of Monsanto and other genetically-modified seed companies . One of L. Paul Bremers last acts as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority was an order stipulating that " farmers shall be prohibited from re-using seeds of protected varieties . " Monsanto has said that it has no interest in doing business in Iraq , but should the company change its mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanity Fair article , there has n't  been a lot of coverage of this topic . However , a February 2012 article titled " Control by Seed " in The Express Tribune newspaper of Karachi , Pakistan said this : <p> " With a single stroke of the pen , Iraqs agriculture was axed , while Order 81 facilitated the introduction and domination of imported , high-priced corporate seeds , mainly from the U.S. which neither reproduce , nor give yields without their prescribed chemical fertilizer and pesticide inputs . It meant that the majority of farmers who had never spent money on seed and inputs that came free from nature , would henceforth have to heavily invest in corporate inputs and equipment or go into debt to obtain them , or accept lowered profits , or give up farming altogether . The U.S. has now completely revamped Iraqs agriculture " <p> The Pakistanis are sensitive to what we do in Iraq because we have pretty much occupied their country as part of the Afghanistan war . <h> ExxonMobils Enforcement Arm <p> " If a man is not an oligarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same starting conditions , everyone could have done it . " <p> So , the conquest of Iraq was indeed about oil , but more accurately , about making oil reserves available for purchase and/or pumping by multinational corporations . If you wo n't sell your nations reserves to Big Oil , the U.S. Marines may pay you a visit . <p> In early 2012 , ExxonMobil confirmed that they had signed an exploration and production deal with Iraqs Kurdistan Regional Government . The Kurds are in defiance of Baghdad , and the deal has infuriated the Iraqi government . ExxonMobil has sided with the Kurds because they are easier to do business with , and if Baghdad does n't  change its tune they just might get invaded again ! <p> This multinational thirst for oil reserves also explains the USAs aggressive attitude toward Russia . If you drive into a Lukoil gas station in New York or New Jersey , for example , they will be happy to sell you Russian gasoline . So , its not like Americans are cut off from Russian oil . But that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be selling you that Russian oil and chillingly , they seem bent on getting it notwithstanding Russias nuclear arsenal . To Big Oil , Russia is just a larger-scale Iraq . <p> In 2003 , ExxonMobil tried to buy a controlling interest in the Russian oil company , Yukos , from Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky . When discussing the deal , Vladimir Putin had this exchange with ExxonMobil CEO , Lee Raymond 14 : <p> Putin : " If you have fifty-one percent , that means that if I want to have Yukos do something , I 'm going to have to come and talk to you ? " <p> Raymond : " Yeah , that 's not so awful . That 's true in a lot of places in the world . " <p> A short time later , Putin threw Khodorkovsky in jail , and carved up Yukos with the pieces going to Russian government-owned oil companies . <p> What we learn from this episode is that the CEOs of multinationals are used to lording it over numerous heads of state . And that Russia is a good example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its 2008 invasion of Georgia , a former Soviet Republic in the Caucasus Mountains of Central Asia . Georgia is strategic because it is the only practical route for Western countries to drain oil &amp; gas from former Soviet turf in Central Asia . <p> On the map below , you can easily see how Georgia is a bottleneck . Russia is to the north , Iran is to the south , and the pipelines go through USA-friendly Azerbaijan and Georgia . Armenia and Azerbaijan are at each others throats , so Georgia is the only USA-friendly option to get oil &amp; gas to NATO-member Turkey , or to the Black Sea and then to the Mediterranean Sea ( click maps to enlarge ) : <p> Vladimir Putin was angered over the attempt to bring Georgia into NATO at the 2008 Bucharest Summit . But guess what ? The oligarchs are still trying to get Georgia in ! Three years after the Russian invasion , Georgia had faded from the memories of the American public . But then , in December 2011 , the newly-minted senator from Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a resolution that directed President Obama to accept Georgias petition to join NATO . <p> That 's an awfully obscure , sneaky , sophisticated stunt for a freshmen Senator to pull . The truly scary part is that the oligarchs are willing to risk war with a large , angry , nuclear-armed nation just to make a few bucks . And if you look at the companies that own the BTC and BTE pipelines , you will see that BP is the senior partner . Perhaps we should call Rubio the " Senator from Britain . " <p> After World War II , we made friends with Japan and Germany . After the Cold War , many thought that we could make friends with Russia , but it did n't  quite work out . Neither Japan nor Germany had oil for our rapacious oligarchs to covet . <h> Putin Ends the New World Order <p> Shortly after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 , George H.W. Bush famously declared " A New World Order . " Essentially , what this meant was that instead of uncooperative Third World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now be invaded by the U.S. Marines in broad daylight . It was no longer necessary to have " deniability " now that there was no risk of a conflict escalating to World War III with the Soviets . <p> Bushs New World Order era ended only nine years later on August 8 , 2008 . Ironically , the news was delivered to Bushs son , George W. Bush by Vladimir Putin . Bush and Putin were sitting next to each other at the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics . Putin leaned over and whispered to Bush : " War has begun . " Australian Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd was sitting two rows back and witnessed the " animated " discussion that ensued . <p> Bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan , the USA abandoned its Georgian ally . U.S. personnel evacuated , leaving behind military equipment , including four Humvees belonging to the U.S. Marines , which were seized by the Russians . The USA demanded the return of the gear , but the Russians refused . Russian general , Anatoliy Nogovitsyn said the Humvees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it appears that he has done so . There has been no media coverage of this story since then . The medias job is to portray the U.S. military as invincible , to help minimize opposition to the Oligarchys next war . Make it look easy ; like a walk in the park . But the loss of those Humvees was a military humiliation . <p> Of course , using military power to advance commercial interests is nothing new ; we have been doing it since 1840 when we first constructed a sizeable navy to protect our merchant ships from the depredations of the much larger British navy . However , what is different today is that our oligarchs and multinationals are no longer loyal to the people that field the military forces they rely upon . Just look at the results : we conquered three OPEC countries : Kuwait , Iraq , and Libya and gasoline is still $4 a gallon . <h> The Stealth Empire <p> Our military empire is a Dark Art because of the way the Oligarchy presents it in their captive media . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his top campaign issues was imperialism . The USA was a plain-speaking nation back then . Today , you will never hear American imperialism even mentioned in the main-stream media . Very few civilians have even a foggy idea of what our military does outside of the major wars . <p> General Smedley Butlers tales of imperial exploits were published in Readers Digest in the 1930s . Today , you will never hear his name mentioned in the Oligarch Media , nor anyone like him . ( See Appendix #6 for more on General Butler . ) <p> How many films convey the vast , global scope of our military operations ? Or depict how our military supercharges globalization ? How many Americans are aware of our military forces stationed in obscure locals like Bulgaria and Romania ? How many Americans even know that Joint Task Force East even exists ? Remember the discussion of Georgia above ? The JTFE is the beginning of moving our forces in Germany closer to Russias Central Asian oil turf . Romania and Bulgaria are on the other side of the Black Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in the history of the world to control all of the worlds oceans , very few Americans are even aware of that fact . You would think the Navy would boast of such a feat , but all of the propaganda is oriented around just the opposite : denying that we are an empire . <p> You see , an empire where all the spoils go to the Oligarchy would not be received favorably by the American people . So , mums the word . <h> We Do n't  Need No Stinking Factories <p> In his book , Unintended Consequences , Edward Conard wrote ( Kindle 901 ) : <p> " Just as lower food costs powered the growth of manufacturing after World War II , today the growing availability of low-cost offshore goods power the growth of investment and domestic services . " <p> To hear The Oligarchys " Ambassador " Conard say that offshoring manufacturing is a stroke of genius is jarring considering that we deploy the military to smash open new markets for the Oligarchy . Where does Conard think the tanks come from ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American troops were killed and maimed because we did n't  have the manufacturing capacity to make the special , super-strong steel needed to harden Humvees against IEDs , ( improvised explosive devices ) . There were only two armor-quality steel mills left in the USA and both were owned by foreign companies ! One of them by a Russian company ! <p> Oregon Steel had been recently bought by Evraz Group S.A. of Russia , and International Steel Group was bought by Arcelor Mittal , a Dutch company . ( See this story for further details . ) <p> During the 2011 conquest of Libya , our French and British allies could n't maintain the tempo because they also lacked sufficient manufacturing capacity they could n't even make bombs . ( See this story for more . ) <p> Just like the Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Latin Debt Crisis of the 1980s , the oligarchs are doing something inane : trying to operate a global military empire while simultaneously destroying the industrial base of the USA ! <p> Or perhaps the Oligarchy is following the Soviet model . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to generate military power . But that is n't the case . <p> The Soviets proved that a powerful military could be created without a particularly strong economy , or even capitalism itself . How did they do it ? With tyranny ; by turning the peasants upside down and shaking them until enough money fell from their pockets to finance the Red Army . And the Oligarchy may be planning a similar system for the USA . <h> Strategic Unemployment <p> Perpetual high unemployment , the Reserve Army of Labor , is not only necessary to keep downward pressure on wages . It is also needed to keep a steady stream of young people flowing into the volunteer military . During the protests against the Vietnam War , the American middle class demonstrated that it would no longer tolerate the continuing slaughter of its sons . Denied conscription , the Oligarchy has been forced to recruit volunteers for its wars of conquest . And that is much easier to do under overpopulated , de-industrialized conditions where decent jobs are scarce-to-nonexistent . Soldiering is a type of labor after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a problem because its a corporate welfare program for multinationals , which are n't  even patriotic corporate citizens . American taxpayers foot the bill while multinationals use the pacified oceans to transfer the jobs of those same taxpayers overseas . We run up huge debts to smash open new markets , and then the multinationals evade the taxes that would pay off those debts . <p> A large portion of our budget deficit , and national debt , is due to security &amp; war subsidies to the multinationals . And in the process of building this empire , our defense elite has grown accustomed to its status as Lords of Earth . When it came time to discuss budget cuts to reduce our massive budget deficit , the Pentagon responded with a nearly direct threat to Congress . On March 30 , 2012 Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said about Congress : <p> " What they essentially did is put a gun to their heads and the heads of the country . " <p> What Panetta " essentially " did was label Congress a threat to national security . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors and marines aboard the USS Peleliu . And that makes us wonder : are our soldiers being mentally prepared to stage a coup ? Are they being indoctrinated to believe that Congress is contemplating treason by depriving funds to the Pentagon ? <p> Funny thing is , Congress was only suggesting a $50 billion per year cut in the nearly $1 trillion military budget . ( The Pentagons " base budget " is $530 billion , but if you add in numerous other programs , and Iraq &amp; Afghanistan war budgets , you can get very close to $1 trillion . See this page for details . ) <p> President Obama should have fired Panetta for threatening U.S. sovereignty . The president , of course , has the power to do so on paper . Behind the scenes , perhaps not . In any case , this was a deeply disturbing incident , and hopefully not a harbinger of things to come . However , the status of our Republic does indeed seem tenuous . <p> Economically , the USA is the largest tentacle of the Oligarchy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to regain its sovereignty . It is critical that the USAs consumer market remains open to the output of Oligarchy sweatshops around the world . For example , if the USA decided to give the one million Maquiladora jobs in Mexico back to their rightful working-class American owners , that would cause a terrible slashing of multinational profits . So obviously , that must be prevented at all costs . And the Oligarchy will do whatever it takes . <p> If you dissect a globalist , you wo n't find a single particle of national pride or patriotism any where in his body . He thinks those things are parochial , fit only for rednecks and rubes . If it would make him a nickel , a globalist would cut his nations throat without a moments hesitation . <h> Disneys Armageddon <p> Disneys 1998 film Armageddon planted not-so-subliminal anti-American images into the minds of viewers : <p> At the 00:03:24 mark , a meteor pierces the American-flag shoulder patch of an astronaut : <p> At the 01:36:13 mark , an astronaut machine-guns , and crashes through the American flag : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through the wall to save the day . And that is exactly how globalists think : that the old USA must be destroyed in order to bring forth a glorious , global utopia , with splendid sweatshops spanning the globe , producing trillions in profits for a handful of chortling oligarchs . <p> Armageddon was released at the height of the flag-burning controversy that culminated with the Supreme Court striking down flag-burning laws in the 1989 Texas vs . Johnson decision . The " Johnson " party of the case was Gregory Lee Johnson , a communist who burned a flag at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas . So that 's the kind of company Disney was keeping . <p> A resurgent America would be a problem for Disney specifically since it makes its products in foreign sweatshops . A reassertion of sovereignty to change the terms-of-trade in favor of American workers would cut deeply into Disney profits . Watch how these Haitian sweatshop workers react when they are told how much the Disney clothes they make sell for in the USA at the 00:04:00 mark of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are astonished at their first glimpse of the matrix : <p> The same is true for virtually every American-based multinational . A re-assertion of American sovereignty is their nightmare scenario . So , to protect their profits , they use all of their powers to make sure that the USAs borders , and the very idea of the USA itself , remains as dissolved as possible . If the flag has to be machine-gunned , then so be it . <h> Disneys Avengers <p> In the 2012 film , The Avengers , Disney characterizes American patriotism as " old fashioned . " At the 00:28:53 mark , we have this dialog : <p> Captain America : " Are n't  the Stars &amp; Stripes a little old fashioned ? " <p> SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson : " With everything that 's happening , the things that are about to come to light , people might just need a little old fashioned . " <p> And so Disney explains to us the role of patriotism under oligarchic rule : when your job is sent to China , you keep your mouth shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep your mouth shut . But when it is time for war on behalf of the Oligarchy , then you may wave your flag . Do n't  forget , SHIELD is an international intelligence/police organization , and Captain America is an employee . <p> In the film , the war was against alien space invaders . In real life , the Oligarchy pushes the " patriotism button " when they want to conquer a country such as Iraq . And so we see the idea of patriotism being transitioned into a narrower scope ; a single dimension : as the esprit de corps for the Oligarchys enforcement arm . <h> Assassinating American Democracy <p> Take a look at the cover of " The Crisis of Democracy " published by David Rockefellers Trilateral Commission : <p> While the flag in the cross-hairs of the sniper rifle is generic , notice that the three colors used are red , white , and blue . The book ostensibly is a study of democracy in the wake of the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s . In reality , it was a manifesto for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that proved successful . <h> Anti-Americanism in The Matrix <p> Neos speech at the end of the 1999 film The Matrix promises : " a world without rules and controls , without borders or boundaries " which is odd because in the film , the Earth does n't  have political borders . There 's just the machine world , and a few rebel humans hiding underground . So , Neos vision is suspiciously compatible with the Oligarchys real-world matrix . <h> The Withering Away of the American State <p> " As the reality of the global market sinks in , policymakers from different nations will come to understand that even the strongest sovereign can not entirely control its own destiny but will increasingly be forced to cooperate on economic issues it once regarded as almost exclusively national concerns . " <p> Former CEO of Citicorp , Walter Wriston wrote about how technology was in the process of eroding sovereign power in his 1992 book The Twilight of Sovereignty . That title is something that a communist might write . After all " eroding sovereign governments " is n't much different than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> As we will see later in this book , bankers were the chief architects of the globalized economy . It was in their financial interest to weaken the USAs borders as much as possible . And while Wriston goes on and on about technology versus horse-and-buggy government , what he perpetrated on the USA was n't the least bit high-tech . In fact , many high-tech U.S. factories were shut down in favor of low-tech , brutal , Third World sweatshops where workers were paid so badly that the sweatshops could undercut roboticized American factories on price . Robots were very expensive back then . <p> For our purposes here , in Walter Wriston , we have a superb specimen of a genuine oligarch clearly stating his desire to witness the demise of " even the strongest of sovereign " meaning , of course , the USA . Wriston died in 2005 , so he was n't around to eat his words when the U.S. government bailed out his dumb bank in 2008 . <h> Sweatshops Only Whet the Appetite <p> Once NAFTA , GATT , and the WTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country crushing the middle class and sending corporate profits into orbit . But as fabulously profitable as they are , sweatshops can be troublesome . After all , workers are free to come and go as they please . They even go on strike and riot when the beatings from overseers get too viscous . <p> Sure , outlawing unions helps , and assassinating union organizers is a splendid diversion , but that does n't  change the fact that huge populations of desperate workers are required to feed the horrendous turn-over in sweatshops . Too many workers burn-out and quit . Isnt there a way to prevent that ? To keep them there working ? <p> " Yes , the McKinley era , absent the protectionism . You 're looking at the history of the country for the first 120 years , up until Teddy Roosevelt , when the socialists took over . The income tax , the death tax , regulation , all that . " <p> -Grover Norquist <p> The quote above is how Republican king-maker , Grover Norquist , replied when journalist William Greider asked him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norquist is eager to return to the days of Robber Barons and sweatshops . The Fair Labor Standards Act wasnt passed until 1938 , so in 1900 there was no minimum wage , no 40-hour workweek , no overtime pay , no health-care plans , no safety or environmental regulations , etc . <p> Here in the USA , we have expectations of progress ; that our lives will improve , technology will advance , and in the future , we will be healthier , happier , and busy doing all kinds of futuristic things . But that is n't the plan . <p> The Norquist Plan is the blueprint currently being implemented by the Oligarchy . They are deeply enamored and envious of their partner , the Communist Party in Beijing . They dream of the day when they too can have a billion-man strong army of peasants toiling away for subsistence wages in pollution-spewing sweatshops , as goon squads keep watch with batons at the ready . Right here in the USA . <p> During the Republican presidential primary debates of early 2012 , the USA had 46 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8% . What did the Republicans propose ? <p> The Oligarchy cunningly distributed their trial balloons to several mouthpieces , but if you add up the proposals , you get children living in shantytowns , and working in sweatshops for whatever wages their oligarch bosses feel like paying them . Most observers thought that Cains elimination of building codes was merely odd , but that is what will be required for the envisioned ram-shackle sweatshops and shantytowns " opportunity zones " to be established in the USA . Current building codes do n't  permit barbarity . <p> 1900 was also the record-setting period for immigration up until the 1990s almost as high as it has been during the last two decades . So , that 's another parallel to Norquists fantasy era : a Reserve Army of Labor to keep wages at , or even below , subsistence levels . <p> The main aspect of slavery is that people can be owned like any other type of property chattels like so many head of cattle or sheep . However , the Reserve Army of Labor can be seen as an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychology : a slave thinks : " I am held in slavery . I may be poor , but it is clearly not my fault . I am a victim . " An unemployed worker thinks : " I am free , but still poor . Maybe I 'm just a loser , or maybe times are tough and will get better soon . " A slave does n't  carry such guilt , and is more likely to focus his negative feelings toward his masters rather than inward toward himself . <p> So , perhaps the Oligarchy is constructing a system that is more effective than chattel slavery a futuristic type of slavery where the slaves are hoodwinked by a superficial liberty . Live in any shantytown you like ! Work in your favorite sweatshop ! Starve in the gutter of your choosing ! You 're free ! <p> Perhaps you cant believe that the Oligarchy would deliberately roll the clock back to a more barbaric time , or emulate the regime in Beijing . However , to a psychopath , it makes perfect sense . Historically , slavery has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to the Oligarchy , ending slavery was a policy error that is long overdue for rectification . <p> The Oligarchy is driven by pure greed ; recognizing no legal , ethical , or moral restrictions and slavery was enormously profitable . Huge fortunes were made by the owners of New World plantations . Scholars ( such as Robert A. Divine , Ph.D. ) estimate that American slave plantations made a solid 8-10% return on capital invested , and we have seen how profitable todays sweatshops are . So , make no mistake , there are plenty of people who will cheerfully profit from rolling back the clock of civilization . In 2010 , the New York Times reported that Apple CEO Steve Jobs said : <p> " I mean , you go to this place , and , its a factory , but , my gosh , I mean , theyve got restaurants and movie theaters and hospitals and swimming pools , and I mean , for a factory , its a pretty nice factory . " <p> A short time later , the Chinese workers in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Chinese journalist went undercover and reported filthy , roach-infested barracks , and harrowing working conditions at a Foxconn factory building the iPhone 5 . This is a superb example of how a psychopath can honestly think that even horrific working conditions can be " pretty nice . " <p> Imagine a slave owner who buys a slave from a master who was lashing the slave daily . The new master only lashes the slave once a week , and goes around town bragging about what a great man he is and how much better off the slave is . See how that works ? A psychopath can justify anything as long as there are worse possibilities . Even egregious psychopaths can truly believe that they are doing " gods work . " The moral of the story is : do n't  underestimate evil . <h> The Department of Slavery <p> In addition to the Reserve Army of Labor , the Oligarchy has other programs operating with slave-like working conditions on a pretty large scale . Dr. Norm Matloff writes about the " handcuffed " tech workers brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major attraction for employers , especially in Silicon Valley , is the " handcuffed " status of H-1Bs . In practical terms , foreign tech workers have mobility issues . In particular , if the worker is being sponsored by the employer for a green card , the worker dare not switch jobs , as that would entail starting the multiyear green card process all over again . Employers value this immobility very highly , since the exit of an engineer in the midst of an urgent project is very harmful . Thus employers tend to give preference to the foreign workers when hiring . " <p> And that begs the question : Has the U.S. government designed these visas with " handcuffs " in mind to facilitate the servitude of these workers on behalf of employers ? In September 2012 , Microsoft proposed that employers pay $10,000 per head to the government for H1-B workers . What they are really suggesting is that the Department of Labor become the Department of Slavery ; pimping out desperate Third World programmers to Silicon Valley coding plantations . <p> In June 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  even keep track of the number of H1-B workers in the country . Estimates are between 600,000 and 1,000,000 . ( Read Robert X. Cringely for more details . ) <p> Even worse is the L-1 visa , which is for foreign companies that transfer employees to the USA . Since the employee is still working for the same company , the visa allows the company to continue paying him the same as they were in the home country . For example , an Indian body shop transfers a programmer from India to their U.S. subsidiary where they put him to work on a software project for an American company . He makes the same annual salary as he did in India $8,000 less than half of American minimum wage . <p> The logic of the L-1 visa would work fine with our advanced trading partners like Canada , the United Kingdom , Germany , Japan , etc . However , by having it apply to low-wage nations also allows multinationals to pay criminally low wages . <p> Yet another category of visa is the H-2B , which originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . For example , a landscaper in Ohio could request a crew of guest workers because landscaping is not year-round up north . Or a hotel could request workers for the holiday season . However , the program has gone out of control with large companies bringing in all kinds of workers regardless of season . About 100,000 per year . <p> In June 2012 , the New York Times reported on the treatment of Mexican H-2B workers at a Walmart supplier , C.J.s Seafood in Louisiana : <p> " Guest workers said they sometimes labored more than 80 hours a week , had been threatened with beatings to press them to work faster and had been warned that their families in Mexico would be hurt if they complained to government agencies . " <p> Lists of employers who requested H2-B visas can be found on this page at the Department of Labor . See this page for an in-depth analysis of the H2-B program . <p> Whenever an employer finds hiring American citizens distasteful , the Department of Slavery stands ready to assist with a visa program : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As discussed below : <h> Shanghaiing Foreign Students into Pennsylvania Sweatshops <p> While the USA officially ended slavery in 1865 , slave-like conditions continued on merchant ships . Men were kidnapped or tricked " Shanghaied " into doing hard work aboard labor-intensive sailing ships . Why did it take Congress another 50 years to pass The Seamens Act of 1915 and end that form of slavery ? Because that 's how long it took for the Clipper ships to be replaced by less labor-intensive steamships . No doubt , there were lobbyists representing shippers greasing palms in Washington D.C. for those 50 years . And when the payoffs stopped , Congress did something " grand " because there was no longer a moneyed opposition . We will see this same pattern later with the sweatshops of Saipan . <p> In August 2011 , the New York Times published " Americas Sweatshop Diplomacy " a story about how imported sweatshop workers ( J-1 visas ) went on strike at a Hersheys facility in Pennsylvania : <p> " They received $8 an hour , but after fees and deductions , including overpriced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.50 an hour . Hersheys once had its own unionized workers packing its candy bars , starting at $18 to $30 an hour . Now the company outsources distribution to a non-union company that hires most of its workers from the J-1 program . " <p> And : <p> " Visa holders can be deported if they so much as complain , and can not easily switch employers . " <p> So , here we have the government using mass immigration to help a corporation convert middle-class union jobs into barely-paid involuntary-servitude jobs . In this case , the workers are foreign students who thought that they were entering some kind of student foreign-exchange program . And they are held in servitude because they were forced to deposit a few thousand dollars up front for the " opportunity " of gaining corporate experience . <p> No legitimate business in the USA requires workers to purchase a job like this , but apparently U.S. authorities have no problem with foreign recruiters collecting such payments . This has apparently been going on for years . These kids ( who can bee seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body shop posing as a do-good-er NGO a non-government organization such as Doctors Without Borders . <p> Again , we will see this pattern in the Saipan example below . The large payments required of workers are necessary because they think they are going to a legitimate job in the Land of Opportunity . Without the threat of losing their deposits , the workers would flee immediately upon realizing that they have been tricked into a sweatshop job . They have no choice but to work like dogs long enough for their deposits to be returned , or wind up being deported and gouged . <p> The New York Times reported ( in the story linked above ) that in 2010 , there were 350,000 J-1 workers brought into the USA . <p> Foreign workers especially ones with children are prized by the multinationals over American citizens because fear of deportation deters foreigners from blowing the whistle . After one lash , a citizen will report you to OSHA . But a guest worker ? He might endure five lashes before fighting back especially if he has a family back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no , we do n't  need these workers . With millions of Americans unemployed , the visa programs should be shut down indefinitely . The stories you see in the Oligarch Media about labor shortages are just propaganda . Dr. Matloff writes about H1-B visas : <p> " There is no tech labor shortage . No study , other than those sponsored by the industry , has ever shown a shortage . " <p> So why all the visas ? Its just the Department of Slavery helping the Oligarchy make larger profits a healthy portion of which are likely kicked-back to Washington via lobbyists . Just like Saipan did : <h> The Sweatshops of Saipan , USA <p> " There were always lots of rats running back and forth in the barracks . Sometimes you would be asleep , and a rat would come right up to your face . It was scary . I could n't sleep with the sound of the running rats , or the fear that they would crawl all over me . " <p> -Chun Yu Wang , Saipan , USA <p> Did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian-style sweatshops on American soil ? If not , do n't  feel bad . The Oligarch Media kept it just as quiet as they did the fact that all your computers and electronic gadgets have been made in Chinese sweatshops for years . <p> But it did indeed happen , and one of the workers even wrote a book about it . The quote above is from page 26 of Chicken Feathers and Garlic Skin by Chun Yu Wang . Here is another : <p> " Throughout the barracks , it seemed there was always someone fightinggirls were literally going crazy from all the pressure and stresssome would sleep with scissors under their pillows to feel safe . " <p> -Chun ( pages 27 &amp; 40 ) <p> When a sweatshop girl feels the need for a shank , she uses a scissors because they are plentiful in garment sweatshops . <p> Saipan is a Pacific Ocean island near Guam . When it became an American commonwealth in 1975 , it was made exempt from U.S. immigration law , the federal minimum-wage law , and it was allowed to export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " labels . It was deliberately constructed as a libertarian utopia within the relatively " over-regulated " USA . <p> Saipan was quickly blanketed with sweatshops producing apparel for major brands like The Gap , Ralph Lauren , Liz Claiborne , Ann Taylor , Levi Strauss , and Walmart . Asian women were brought in , housed in rat-and-roach infested barracks and forced to work under appalling conditions . <p> " With so many girls finishing work at the same time , sometimes you had to wait on line for one or two hours just to take a shower . Sometimes we would work until 2am . Sowe couldnt get to shower before bed . The conditions were disgusting . " <p> -Chun ( page 27 ) <p> After learning of the abuses in 1995 , the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill to put an end to the sweatshops . However , Saipan officials swung into action and hired infamous lobbyist , Jack Abramoff who purchased the requisite number of Congressmen to keep the sweatshops running . Abramoff was so successful that Congress never acted to re-establish civilization on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshop profits . Around $30 million per year , depending on how good business was . So , that 's how they were able to purchase a sizeable chunk of Congress . One of the things Abramoff did was fly Congressmen out to Saipan to play golf on the gorgeous tropical island . <p> " On the golf courseyou indulge the decision maker with all manner of luxury . Now you see why Congress loves golf . " <p> -Jack Abramoff , Capitol Punishment ( Kindle 86 ) <p> Imagine semi-imprisoned Asian immigrant girls toiling away under conditions more harsh than any American prison , while across the street , corrupt politicians play golf at a lavish country club . And that 's an accurate vision of the libertarian dystopia that the Oligarchy plans for America . <p> You see , Jack Abramoff was n't just any old mercenary lobbyist . He believed in what was going on in Saipan . Abramoff was a hard-core , right-wing Republican who fervently believed in laissez-faire economics . He would happily turn all of the USA into one giant Saipan if he could make a buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast that the needles would sow into our fingersGarment factory work is very hard work . Every second , of every minute , of every hour you have to work very fast , and very carefully . " <p> -Chun ( pages 62 &amp; 167 ) <p> Many girls could not keep up with the demanding pace of sweatshop work , and since there were virtually no other jobs on Saipan , some became " forty-dollar girls " prostitutes . So , one wonders if Abramoffs " travelers " as he called his pet Congressmen were doing more than playing golf on Saipan . <p> This is another reason why the male citizens of Saipan supported the sweatshops , and defend them to this day . Not only did Saipan make millions of dollars , and give citizens cushy government jobs , but for every male citizen there were perhaps ten down-trodden and vulnerable young Asian women yearning to be rescued from a very real hell . It amounted to a bizarre form of polygamy , where the women toiled to support the men . <p> " Sometimes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and there was urine and feces on the floor . " <p> -Chun ( page 121 ) <p> That was a frequent problem because the workers were forced to resort to using scraps of cloth for toilet paper . <p> Saipan is what one of Herman Cains " opportunity zones " would look like . Yet during the 2012 Republican primary debates , nobody in the media countered Cain by using Saipan as a cautionary tale . You could watch mainstream-media news for the rest of your life , and never hear the word " Saipan " even on MSNBC . " Saipan " is a banned word in the Oligarch Media , which means they continue to yearn for such a system in the USA . <p> " By law , whenever the Department of Labor came to inspect the factory conditions , they were required to notify the boss first , so the boss always knew exactly when to clean the toilets to make a good impression . <p> -Chun ( page 122 ) <p> Congress never acted to put an end to Saipans sweatshops . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import quotas under the Multi Fiber Arrangement were ended in January 2005 , and the textile trade was brought under control of the World Trade Organization . Without the quotas , Saipans sweatshops were no longer protected from even lower-paying sweatshops in places like China and Bangladesh . Saipans sweatshops started to close down ; the last one closed four years later , in 2009 . <p> Ultimately , Saipan was too small for the Oligarchy . It needed a larger population of downtrodden workers , and even lower wages . And so , thanks to the WTO , nearly all of the USAs textiles are now made in barbaric Third-World sweatshops . American textile jobs : <p> The chart above only goes back to 1990 . Undoubtedly , many more textile jobs have been lost to globalization . After all , a large swath of the New York City skyline was constructed by the rag trade . <p> While the sweatshops of Saipan are gone , the danger of Saipan is still with us . Saipan re-introduced the idea of sweatshops back into American culture after a 70-year absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to close down Saipan , and thus the idea of sweatshops on U.S. soil was proven to be politically feasible given a suitably corrupt Congress . If the American public is more desensitized to sweatshops now , the next attempt at sweatshops on American soil may find smoother sailing . This is why free-trade with sweatshop nations like China is harmful to the USA : it makes slave-like working conditions seem normal . <h> The Return of the Slave Ships <p> During the Great Recession , the oligarchs flooded the USA with millions of legal immigrants thereby dramatically worsening unemployment . As ruthless as that was , you ai n't  seen nothing yet . Consider this quote from Edward Conards book " Unintended Consequences " ( Kindle 3777 ) : <p> " In the future , when we have learned to manage our economy more effectively , immigrants will begin life in America as temporary guest workers before we give them permanent residency . Well skim the cream from the rest of the worlds workforce and replace the less skilled and less reliable with an unlimited flow of temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well save a lot of money managing our workforce that way , by avoiding retiree benefits , for example . " ( Emphasis added ) . <p> And how would that " unlimited flow " of labor actually get here ? Imagine a huge fleet of passenger ships sailing a continuous circuit from Asia to the California , stuffed with Chinese , Malaysians , Vietnamese , etc . As the starving masses disembark , they see vast pens on the docks containing rejected workers waiting to board the ships to be sent home in disgrace . Imagine how fearful the new immigrants will be . They will get the message : " Work like dogs for peanuts , and do it with a smile on your face , or we will send you right back to the Third-World hellhole you came from . " <p> Now imagine another fleet sailing between Texas and South America . And another one between New York and Africa . Because for all practical intents and purposes , the supply of downtrodden masses is infinite relative to the size of the U.S. economy . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 133.8 million non-farm jobs , and the population of the world was 7 billion . <p> If Edward Conard and his ilk get their way with our laws immigration , minimum-wage , child-labor , and building-codes replacing every middle-class job in the USA is entirely feasible . And we know the multinationals are not shy . Already , American IT workers are being replaced with Indians on a mass scale for poverty-level wages . Bill Gates himself has called for " infinite " immigration ( see below ) . In fact , floating sweatshops might be invading U.S. territorial waters by time you read this . <p> Australian start-up company , Blueseed , is attempting to anchor a ship off the coast of Silicon Valley . The company says they will fill the ship with " entrepreneurs " who will invent the next Facebook , Google , or Apple . Blueseed says this is necessary because the USA does not have an entrepreneurs visa . <p> However , the idea that entrepreneurs cant get into the USA because we do n't  have a special visa for them is absurd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA . If Blueseeds " entrepreneurs " are so fabulous , why cant they figure out how to get here without an invitation being hand-delivered to them on a silver platter ? And why cant they just invent the " next Apple " in their own country ? <p> Blueseeds business plan is the codification of contempt for American sovereignty . Their plan is to flagrantly violate the spirit of American immigration law , if not the letter of the law . The company also claims that their service is aimed at high-flying entrepreneurs , but rent , including office space , on the ship will be only $1600 per month . That seems awfully cheap for the next Steve Jobs , and well within the range of a corporate outsourcing budget . <p> If Blueseed is n't sunk by a torpedo from a patriotic U.S. Navy submarine commander , nobody should be surprised if the ship ends up filled with coders from India toiling away for American multinationals . <h> Sweatshop Schools <p> The Oligarchy wants to privatize schools . No doubt , they are eying-up all those " overpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made from eliminating them . But how will poor people afford to send their children to private schools ? Well , if the Republicans get their way , and the child labor laws are revoked , as Newt Gingrich proposes , maybe the poor children could earn their keep . Just like they do in Chinas sweatshop schools . <p> Or perhaps , once government treasuries are completely looted by tax-dodging oligarchs , poor children will just go uneducated like slave children in the Old South . After all , if there is no profit in educating the poor , what CEO could justify such folly ? <h> The Seductions of Slavery <p> " The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it capitalism batters down all Chinese walls , with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate . " <p> The American people are already being seduced into accepting the return of slavery . One of the tactics that The Oligarchy uses to argue that the factories can not be brought back to the USA is that consumer prices would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dare even think about tariffs , or you will pay more for your next toaster ! " <p> Of course , if you are unemployed , you really do need cheap toasters from China at Walmart . But what if the toaster factory came back to the USA and you got a job on the assembly line ? A well-paid union job ? All of sudden you do n't  need to worry too much about prices at Walmart anymore , right ? You might even graduate to shopping at Sears . <p> But that 's an argument that you will never hear from the Oligarch Media for the simple reason that the Oligarchy makes far more money when the toaster factory is located in a cheap-labor country . And the cheaper the better . In fact , the appalling conditions at many sweatshops are only an eyelash away from flat-out slavery . <p> As shocking as it may be , slavery is the ultimate Dark Art of the American Oligarchy because it generates enormous profits . Profits that can be used to purchase more politicians , lawyers , lobbyists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quote from Karl Marx above . The walls of American sovereignty have been battered down with cheap prices , as he says , but who is doing the battering ? In Marxs day , you might have the British battering down the walls of China , or the USA battering down the walls of Japan . But today , there is no one nation battering down our walls . Rather , it is the Oligarchy , which locates its sweatshops in whichever nation that currently has the most favorable conditions for labor strip-mining . <p> Also , in Marxs day , such battering was n't all bad . For example , downed trade barriers allowed modern medicine to get into areas where lives would have otherwise been lost . But do we receive such a benefit today ? Are Mexican cars better than the cars that used to be built in Detroit ? Are Chinese toys safer ? Are Vietnamese shoes , or Bangladeshi clothes better than what we used to make in New England ? <p> Perhaps there is a beneficial import in there somewhere one that we would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  battered down our walls . But for the most part , what we have is flat-out carpetbagging and looting . Something closer to the British Oligarchy pumping opium into China after battering down their barriers during the Opium Wars . <p> So , the " higher prices " argument is revealed as a propaganda weapon trained on America whenever it contemplates restoring its sovereignty . And yes , the Oligarchy does indeed consider the idea of sovereignty to be " barbaric " and in need of " battering down " just like Marx said . <h> Sweatshop System Analysis <p> The massive profits are not made by the sweatshops or the sweat-warehouses , but by the multinationals that dictate their working conditions . Apple tells Foxconn : " you are permitted x dollars of profit per unit on this contract , " where x is a very small number . Foxconn must then crack the whip on its workers if it wants to make even a thin profit . Ironically , Foxconn even resorts to Shanghaiing Chinese students to fill temporary worker shortages . ( New York Times story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale , Walmart tells its logistics company : " operate the warehouse for x cents per item shipped , " where x is an impossibly small amount of profit . Like Foxconn , the logistics company has no choice but to operate as a virtual slave plantation . <p> The important point is that the multinationals make record profits by commanding their contractors to implement egregious working conditions . It is not an accident that the sweatshops are located in China , the most-populous nation in the world . And the USA is the third-most populous ( after #2 India ) possessing a massive , and deliberately constructed , Reserve Army of Labor . <p> The work is farmed out to hatchet men ( contractors ) so that the multinationals do n't  have to get their hands dirty ; to keep their brands pristine ; and to provide deniability . When appalling working conditions are exposed by crusading journalists , the multinational simply says : " It was n't us ; it was a contractor . We have reprimanded them , and this will never happen again . " <h> Voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two major components : sweatshops that are voluntary minimum-security prisons , and the Reserve Army of Labor . When a denizen of the favelas needs money for food , shelter , doctor bills , etc. , she can check into one of the prisons , toil for as long as she is physically able , making designer clothing for the oligarchs , and then check out to regain her health , " slacking off " back in the favelas . <h> Second-Hand Slavery <p> Looking at the organizational structure of a the Chinese sweatshop/American sweat-warehouse system , we can fantasize how agricultural slavery would be brought back to the USA . Imagine a plantation owner , the master , setting up production of fabulous new organic food products : <p> Step 1 Setup Shell Companies The master would set up a series of shell companies incorporated in the most barbarous nations available . China , Columbia , Mexico , Jordan the usual human-rights suspects . The goal would be deniability , and partial legal cover for the planned atrocities . <p> Step 2 Lease Land The public-facing corporate entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byzantine corporate structure . He would n't know what he was getting into , and would remain the owner of the land a potential fall guy if the planned atrocities are exposed . <p> Step 3 Bribe Officials The master purchases the requisite public officials , and instructs them to look the other way . <p> Step 4 Construct Contractor Pyramid The master hires a manager whose job it would be to hire a contractor . The contractors job would be to find two more contractors : an " agricultural logistics " expert ( i.e. the overseer ) , and an " agricultural staffing " expert ( i.e. the slave buyer ) . The master will be officially uninformed of the doings of these " rogue " employees . <p> Step 5 Slave Acquisition The staffing expert fills positions using the whole range of nefarious schemes we see in use today : tricking gullible foreigners , preying upon the chronically unemployed with children to feed , etc . Recruitment vans will prowl through local ghettos , and if volunteers ca n't be found , goon squads will snatch people off the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plantation Operations The slaves will be housed in Foxconn-style barracks only with iron bars over the windows instead of suicide-prevention nets . The barracks will be off-site , on a different patch of land owned by a different shell company . Each morning , the slaves will be bussed to the plantation , work all day , and then be hauled back at night . Depending upon supply , slaves may be worked to death , and buried in mass graves . <p> Step 7 Social Acceptance The plantation will grow fabulous organic foods . The company spokesman will appear on TV wearing fashionable black turtleneck sweaters , and give impressive presentations of the glorious new food products . People will stand in line overnight to buy these cutting-edge products , and they will tune-out stories of the slave labor that produced them . People will accept fascism as long as it is fashionable . <p> Step 8 Profitability and Respectability The plantation will make huge profits and its stock will soar . Other companies will rush to imitate their " logistics prowess " and a thousand plantations will bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the law of the land will be rewritten to accommodate the new de facto " workplace " standards . <h> Is the U.S. Government Violating the 13th Amendment to the Constitution ? <p> The 13th Amendment not only outlawed slavery , but also involuntary servitude . It is a brief amendment ; here is the complete jurisdiction . <p> Section 2 Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . <p> While we do n't  have chattel slavery , it can be argued that we have involuntary servitude . Modern practices differ from those of this nations early history , but their intent is clear : make people work against their will . <p> Tricking gullible foreigners into handing over thousands of dollars , and then holding that cash for ransom is clearly a technique designed to induce servitude . And using foreign recruiting firms is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this website for further discussion . ) <p> To land her Saipan job , Chun Yu Wang ( page 16 ) had to pay a Chinese recruiter $3,500 , which is an enormous sum for a Chinese peasant . She had to borrow the money from relatives who would be financially devastated if she were unable to pay them back . If she had been fired and deported from Saipan , her life back in China would have been grievously harmed . <p> The Hersheys workers , and the Saipan workers were clearly financially bound to their masters and compelled to accept slave-like working- and living conditions for fear of the consequences of disobedience . <p> Tellingly , these violations of the spirit of the Constitution are not even a political issue in the USA . Most Americans have no idea that it is even happening . And that is how you can tell that it is official Oligarchy policy : their captive media and political parties keep it as quiet as possible . <p> " I 'm not a U.S. company , and I do n't  make decisions based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when CEO of ExxonMobil . <p> The more you learn of the doings of the Oligarchy , the colder the chill down your spine becomes . Their intent is clear , and American citizens are squarely in their crosshairs . Perhaps one day they will abduct us , and hunt us for sport on some private island . <p> A huge smoking-gun that tells the tale of the Oligarchys character is that mass-immigration was not curtailed during the recent Great Recession as it was during the Great Depression of the 1930s . The Oligarchy continued on its drive to crush wages without even blinking an eye . ( If you increase the supply of something in this case , labor its price goes down . And " price " means your paycheck , even if you keep your job ) . <p> Why are the multinationals so ruthless in the governance of the USA ? Because like Lee Raymond said above , they are simply not American companies anymore . In the 1980s , U.S. manufacturing companies petitioned the Reagan Administration to protect them from the tidal wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't  see many multinationals demanding protection from Chinese or Mexican imports , right ? That 's because they have moved much of their production out of the USA . Now they have the exact opposite incentive : they now pressure the government to leave China alone and allow the cheap imports to continue flowing in . <p> Because they are making the cheap imports . In China , Mexico , Brazil , etc . <p> For example , in the 1980s , American automakers faced competition from Toyotas imported from Japan . Today , the USA imports a lot of cars from Mexico , but can you name a single Mexican brand ? No , right ? That 's because there are n't  any . Mexico makes American branded cars ( and brands of other nations too ) for export to the USA . <p> So , it makes no sense for General Motors to seek protection from cheap Mexican imports because they are making a good chunk of those cars in their own Mexican plants . The Ford Fiesta is made in Mexico with a Brazilian engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a sea-change in American history that few people realize . The very corporations that once made America strong have switched allegiance , and now train their economic guns on the USAs economic sovereignty . They have erased our borders and have a strong incentive to keep them erased . <p> A couple of years before the Great Recession , one of the USAs largest employers , IBM , began " Project Lean " a program to increase profitability by firing American workers and replacing them with cheap workers overseas ; primarily in India . All throughout the Great Recession , IBM brazenly stuck to their " No Americans " hiring policy . After the recession ended , they cranked up the offshoring even more . <p> In fact , the Great Recession was used as an excuse by multinationals like IBM to intensify offshoring : " Business is slow ; we have to cut costs . We have to lay people off . " Americans understand that companies have to cut payrolls during recessions . But in the old days , companies would hire workers back when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest in creating jobs in the USA . They will only do so if they have no other options . <p> You would think that the Republican Party would be worried about being seen as close allies of the communist regime in Beijing , but they obviously are not . They put the interests of the Beijing/multinational axis above American interests . This treasonous behavior was dramatically showcased when the Federal Reserve Bank announced plans for " QE2 " in 2010 . Chinese officials criticized the plan , and the Republicans led by CNBCs Larry Kudlow began a pressure campaign to seize control of Fed policy . It was quite the spectacle , and solid proof that the Oligarchys loyalties lie with China , not the USA . <p> In January 2011 , President Obama appointed General Electric CEO , Jeff Immelt to be his " Jobs Czar " with the task of curing the unemployment caused by the Great Recession . This is a smoking gun because Immelt spent the Great Recession offshoring jobs . From the U.S. Department of Labors database , here is a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fox is put in charge of the hen house , you know the fix is in . This appointment clearly documents Obama as a functionary of the Oligarchy . Furthermore , the full title of the position is : " Chairperson of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness . " Notice how its just " jobs , " and not " creating jobs , " or even better , " creating American jobs . " It does n't  specify the country , and that makes Immelt eminently qualified because he s fantastic at creating jobs in low-wage countries ! <p> Having the word " competitiveness " in the title is also a smoking gun because it is a code-word for " sweatshops . " For example , you might hear oligarchs talking about European countries like this : " They are n't  competitive enough for the global economy because their unions are too entrenched . " <p> So , " competitiveness " means that we have to beat our wages down to global rates before the oligarchs like Jeff Immelt will be willing to bring their sweatshops back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom " by overturning all of our workplace achievements before the oligarchs will bless us with their precious sweatshop jobs . <p> When a president creates an office titled " Chairperson of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness " and staffs it with a top ( maybe the top ) offshoring practitioner , he is blatantly giving a green light to the oligarchs to keep going full-steam ahead toward re-establishing sweatshops and favelas in the USA . <h> The War on Terror <p> While our blue-collar men and women were fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq , the Oligarchy was moving their former factory jobs to China . The New York Times reported that soldier suicides exceeded battle deaths in the first-half of 2012 . And the veteran unemployment rate stayed mostly in double-digits after the Great Recession ended : <p> However , this follows a long tradition of treating soldiers like cannon fodder . <h> The Revolutionary War <p> The Oligarchys ruthless treatment of soldiers goes back to the Revolutionary War . A farm laborer named Daniel Shays distinguished himself in battle against the British for five years without pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court for non-payment of debt . So were lots of other soldiers , and Shays Rebellion was launched in 1786 . <h> The Civil War <p> In July of 1863 , President Abraham Lincoln had to divert several regiments of Union troops to New York City to put down massive draft riots . Working-class men of the city rioted when they learned that the new federal draft laws allowed rich men to buy their way out of serving in the Civil War for a $300 commutation fee . <h> World War I <p> General Smedley Butler wrote in his book , War is a Racket that World War I soldiers were paid a paltry $30 per month . And after numerous deductions : " Most soldiers got no money at all on pay days . " ( Page 18 . ) After the war , Congress awarded bonuses to soldiers , but part of it was paid in certificates that could not be cashed-in for 20 years . Due to the hardship of the Great Depression , veterans pressed Congress to pay the bonuses earlier . President Hoover and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Bonus Army . In 1932 , President Hoover ordered General MacArthur to disperse the Bonus Army with infantry , cavalry , and tanks . <h> World War II <p> The Oligarchy was perhaps at its weakest level in American history during the years after World War II . The G.I. Bill was passed in 1944 , and veterans were empowered to join and build the middle class . <h> Today <p> The mass exodus of factories to China began at about the same time that the Global War on Terror ( GWOT ) was launched . The GWOT officially began on October 7 , 2001 , and the USA brought China into the World Trade Organization only two months later on December 11th . While sweatshop-generated dollar signs danced before the eyes of greedy oligarchs , no consideration at all was given to where returning veterans would work after their service in the GWOT . <p> Even worse , in 2006 , with two wars in progress , the Bush administration pressured the Army to outsource some of the staff at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KBR , a Halliburton subsidiary . Wounded soldiers soon found themselves housed in squalid conditions . The Washington Post published a series of stories on the Walter Reed scandal . <p> Private-sector unions are a shadow of their former selves . Membership dropped to 6.9% of the workforce in 2011 from 24.2% in 1973 . <p> But that is n't good enough . The Oligarchs want to take it down to 0% . They wont be satisfied until unions are illegal . Perhaps they will permit a government-controlled union such as those operated by the communist governments of China , Vietnam , and Cuba . Perhaps not . After all , communist governments at least have to make a pretense of being on the side of workers . Oligarchs do not . Oligarchs look at people as " warm bodies " plentiful , disposable , and interchangeable . To them , having a union for people is like having a union for plough horses . <p> This callous attitude was on display in 2012 when many multinationals were announcing record profits . In July of that year , Caterpillar announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The company celebrated by beating down the wages of its machinists at their Joliet , Illinois plant . <p> Why would Caterpillar do such a thing ? Because they can . Or more precisely , because global labor arbitrage , and the Reserve Army of Labor allows them to get away with it . <p> The most-senior Caterpillar machinists were making about $55,000 per year . At the end of this CNBC video , you can see former auto executive , Bob Lutz , calling such union workers an " aristocracy . " Can you believe that ? Said Lutz : <p> " The old-time industrial wage that the high-end industrial aristocracy of the extremely highly paid UAW and machinists is a thing of the past , and were going to have to get competitive . " <p> The CEO of Caterpillar was being paid $17 million per year at the time , and the $55,000 machinists were the aristocracy ? Ridiculous . <p> When Lutz says that " we " have to get " competitive " , he does n't  mean management , of course . He means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's no more than $2.00 per hour ultimately . For now , new industrial workers are getting a working-class $11 per hour . <p> In effect , what these oligarchs are demanding here is literally the eradication of the blue-collar segment of the American middle class . They got exercised by the Caterpillar strike because they are class warriors , hell-bent on their scorched-earth campaign . The outcome of the strike would not change Caterpillars profits very much , but that is n't the point . The point is to crush insolent citizens . The oligarchs have seen the future of the USA , and it is Chinese-style authoritarianism . They have Beijing Fever , and are demanding total subservience from workers . <p> Bob Lutz was working for General Motors in 2008 . In this video , you can see him begging for the taxpayers to bail out his bankrupt company . GM eventually received a $49.5 billion loan from the taxpayers . Only a few years later , he was calling for the blood of those very same taxpayer/workers . <p> Bob Lutz collects classic cars , motorcycles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these flying over your protest , it might be Lutz maneuvering for a strafing run : <p> But an oligarch can never have too many jets . And so , the middle class must be liquidated with the resulting savings from lower wages flowing into the fighter-jet collections of the likes of Bob Lutz . <h> Labor Unions are Evil All of a Sudden ? <p> Right-wing Republicans like Lutz and Kudlow werent always so rabidly anti-union . As a matter of fact , during the Cold War , they were huge fans of Lech Walesas Solidarity union in Poland . The labor union that broke Soviet tyranny . <p> Here is what right-wing Republican Jack Abramoff wrote about Solidarity in his book , " Capitol Punishment " ( page 15 ) : <p> " We organized a national petition drive to support Lech Walesas solidarity movement in Poland , and put together a protest rally which ended with an impromptu rush on the Polish Embassy . " <p> The oligarchs would have us believe that with the Soviets defeated , there is no longer a need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunger Games is a movie , and series of novels set in the future where " The Capitol " rules North America . The Capitol is a super high-tech , and super ruthless society , forcing plebeian children to slaughter each other for entertainment . <p> We are n't  quite that ruthless yet , but when it comes to offshoring jobs , and throwing millions of Americans out of work , and eviscerating the middle class , our oligarchs are 100% ruthless . What happens to the children of those discarded workers ? According to the USDA , 47% of food-stamp recipients are children . So that 's about 22 million children playing this early version of the Hunger Games . <p> In the wake of the massive sit-down strikes of 1936-1937 , the Oligarchy grudgingly permitted the construction of a middle class . After all , one can not wage war on Germany , Japan , and the Soviet Union with workers sitting on the assembly lines . <p> However , once the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 , and the Cold War ended , it was payback time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Time to kick them out of their " green , leafy " suburbs , and send them back to the sweatshops , slums , and shantytowns where they belong . Time to make them " bend the knee " to their betters . <p> Ironically , the rise of the American Oligarchy should be viewed as a symptom of American decline . After all , transitioning from a fabulously successful middle-class society back to a feudal two-class society ( oligarchs and plebs ) can hardly be considered progress . This decline began as a consequence of what historians call the " imperial overstretch " of the Vietnam War . <p> The Vietnam War was designed to be a perpetual profit-generator for the military-industrial complex even at the expense of the financial integrity of the federal government . To buy all of those helicopters , the government had to print lots of money , which caused inflation . Around the world , nations saw the purchasing-power of the dollars that they held start to melt away , so they rushed to cash-in their dollars for gold . <p> President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window " in 1971 to prevent Fort Knox from being cleaned out . In retrospect , we can see that severing the dollar from gold was a linchpin in permitting unlimited globalization in the following decades because it removed constraints on trade deficits . So , that inadvertently laid the foundation for the Oligarchy to build upon down the road via massive offshoring . However , there were more immediate effects of the war . <p> The federal governments financial problems were plain for the world to see . Our enemies knew that we were weak and went on the offensive . Many American and British oil facilities around the world were nationalized during that period . Even worse , the Soviets trained and equipped the Egyptian army and sent them into Israel in 1973 , which brought on the Arab Oil Embargo . <p> The debacle in Vietnam led directly , and swiftly , to OPECs rise to power . However , nations like Saudi Arabia , Iraq , and Iran did n't  have banking systems able to handle the flood of petrodollars . So they kept their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks . David Rockefeller , who was CEO of Chase Manhattan Bank at the time , states this in his Memoirs ( Kindle 5750 ) : <p> So , for example , when an American refinery bought oil from the Saudis , no money went to Saudi Arabia , but was simply transferred out of the refinerys Chase account and into the Saudis Chase account . <p> Essentially what happened was that money from American consumers that would have otherwise been spent making payments on things like washing machines , was diverted into OPEC bank accounts at U.S. banks . <p> With more money on deposit , and thus , more money to loan , the banks , including Rockefellers Chase Manhattan Bank , proceeded to squander it by loaning it to Third World nations like Brazil , Mexico , and Argentina in the 1970s . The Latin American Debt Crisis began in 1982 when Mexico defaulted . This is one of the most-spectacular examples of the Oligarchys incompetence because after making the loans , Rockefeller took actions to guarantee their default ! <p> In Memoirs ( Kindle 7424 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Federal Reserve Bank Chairman in 1978 . Rockefeller turned down the offer because he did n't  want to suffer the bad publicity from the " draconian policies " that he thought were needed to combat inflation . Rockefeller then " strongly recommended Paul Volcker " for the job , Volcker was appointed , and got busy with Rockefellers draconian policies . By 1981 , Volcker had taken interest rates up to 20% , and Rockefellers banking clients south of the border were crushed like bugs . They had no chance to service their huge loans at those rates . <p> The debt owed by Latin America was so huge that it caused a " lost decade " in the region , and drastic measures were required for the bankers to get their money back . <p> Rockefellers first swing at the scheme was with the Trilateral Commission . The idea was to convince Japan and Germany to take more imports from Rockefellers debtor nations , which would then use the revenue to pay off their loans . At the time , Japan and Germany had large trade surpluses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Trilateral Commission was very successful . Its first official meeting was held in 1973 , and it took over the American government only three years later . Trilateralist J. Paul Austin , chairman of the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company , recruited local boy Jimmy Carter into the group , loaned him a corporate jet , and bankrolled his campaign . Elected in 1976 , President Carter named a couple dozen Trilateralists to top posts , including Vice President Mondale . <p> Mondale was dispatched to Germany and Japan to sell the scheme , however Japan and Germany were hard-core mercantilist nations and were not about to allow cheap imports to damage their domestic industries . They told Mondale to pound sand . <p> In retrospect , the Trilateral strategy was naive . One does not talk mercantilist nations out of such policies . <p> David Rockefeller retired as chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1981 , just before Mexico defaulted . Did he see it coming ? Probably so . From page 434 of his Memoirs : <p> " In 1981 , soon after retiring from the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Center for Inter-American Relations . " <p> Having failed with the Trilateral Commission , he resumed his efforts with the Council of the Americas . Rockefeller had just witnessed a huge transfer of wealth from American consumers to OPEC . Did he get the idea to engineer another such transfer ? From American consumers to Latin American nations this time ? And thence to himself as a shareholder of Chase ? <p> In 1986 , Rockefeller commissioned a study from Fred Bergsten ( a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations ) . From page 435 of Memoirs : <p> " a landmark work that went a long way toward replacing the prevailing economic orthodoxy with a new set of assumptions that would eventually become know as Neoliberalism or the Washington consensus . " <p> Note : The term " Neoliberalism " is not used very often in the USA , but around the world it is used to describe the negative effects of laissez-faire economics , somewhat similar to " trickle down economics " only with a more sinister connotation . <p> Rockefeller also had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin American oligarchs : <p> " in other words , by ending the symbiotic relationship between government and the oligarchs over the economics of the region . " <p> Of course , it was really a transfer of power from the local oligarchs to American oligarchs like Rockefeller . Under orders from their American banking creditors , Mexico began to " voluntarily " institute " free trade " reforms , and then we arrive at : <p> " As one country after another adopted the export-driven model of economic growth , they needed a destination for their goods , particularly the U.S. market . " <p> And so , Rockefeller put President George H.W. Bush to work on the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the rest is history . <p> After NAFTA was adopted , Rockefeller began to agitate for the " Free Trade Area of the Americas " that would include all Latin countries except for Cuba . He wrote ( p. 437 ) : <p> " there was a tangible sense that we could and would solve our many problems together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America " of course . He meant the Oligarchy . Rockefeller also essentially admits that he was the driving force behind the absence of labor and environmental standards in NAFTA , and the unconstitutional " fast track " process that got it passed ( pages 437-438 ) : <p> " In the final years of the Clinton administration a strongly protectionist Democratic Party , insistent upon unrealistic and unworkable labor and environmental standards , joined with the isolationist wing of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives to thwart most trade initiatives especially granting the president authority to negotiate trade agreements on a " fast track " basis , which Congress could then accept by a simple majority vote , rather than the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution . " ( Emphasis added . ) <p> President Bush referred to " fast track " as " trade promotion authority " or TPA . So , in the next quote Rockefeller takes credit for TPA , and when he says " Council of the Americas " he is referring to pretty much himself ( page 438 ) : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ultimately successful effort to secure TPAthe Council lobbied hard for the legislation . " <p> And so , the Constitution was violated , labor rights and environmental standards were cast to the wind , and the Age of Globalist Carpetbaggers was upon us . <p> The fight to monetize the middle class on behalf of the Oligarchy quickly became the top issue during the very next presidential campaign after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 . George H.W. Bush was president from 1989-1992 , and it is fair to say that his support for NAFTA cost him re-election . <p> If Perot had not entered the race to battle against NAFTA , Bush may have been re-elected . <h> The Giant Sucking Sound <p> Perot became famous for coining the phrase : " the giant sucking sound " ( GSS ) which you can see Perot explain at the 1:54 mark of this presidential-debate video . Since wages were so much lower in Mexico than they were in the USA , Perot explained that factories and jobs would be sucked into Mexico . <p> Initially , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll costs . Then they would export their products back into the USA sporting greatly reduced prices . At that point , their remaining American competitors would have a choice : move production to Mexico in order to compete on cost , or go out of business . <p> So , the GSS was a positive feedback loop where Mexico became a giant black hole , pulling factories out of the USA . Even patriotic owners of factories that did not want to fire their American workers and move their plants to Mexico had no choice but to do so . Sure , they could cut the wages of their American workers to try to lower costs . However , no American could pay his mortgage on $2 per hour , so even if there was no minimum wage , there was no practical way for American factories to compete . <p> Fifteen years later , the GSS had spread to China and India growing into a " category 5 " hurricane that smashed the U.S. economy during the Financial Crisis of 2008 ( see below ) . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transferring wealth from the middle class to the Oligarchy , just as intended . When you see investors on ABCs " Shark Tank " television show demanding that patriotic company owners move their factories to China , that 's the GSS in action . <h> Perot Withdraws <p> Not being a professional politician , Perot delivered a flaky performance . He dropped out of the race in July , and jumped back in during October . Nevertheless , he received 19.8% of the vote , which was the best showing of a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 . <p> Perot was generally recognized to have won at least the first of three debates with Bush and Clinton . And that rattled the political establishment . So they changed the rules . The changes adopted by the Commission on Presidential Debates prevented Perot from participating in the debates during the 1996 campaign even while polls showed that 80% of Americans opposed the new rules and wanted Perot in the debates . <p> Perots candidacy demonstrated popular opposition to globalization . However , the Oligarchy changed the rules , vetoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how things work in an oligarchic system , of course . <p> After the 1992 election , Perot continued to battle NAFTA . And the new Vice President , Al Gore , was sent to fight on behalf of the Oligarchy . <p> While Al Gore currently has a tree-hugger image , it is important to remember that he was one of the Founding Fathers of the American Oligarchy due to his efforts to neutralize Perot and pave the way for NAFTA . Ironically , Gores father , Senator Albert Gore , Sr. led the fight against the " Canada-United States Automotive Products Agreement " back in 1965. 18 That pact sent a large number of U.S. auto plants to Canada . Too bad Al junior did n't  learn anything from his father . <p> After the 1992 presidential election , Perot continued the fight against NAFTA . This video is the first of eight of the Larry King show from November 9 , 1993 . Ross Perot debates NAFTA with Gore , and Gore comes across as every inch the slick , lying , corporate shill . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up a chart illustrating the USAs trade surplus with Mexico in 1992 ( at 3:55 into video #2 ) . Said Gore : <p> " If that trend continues for another two years , and NAFTA will , by removing those barriers , greatly accelerate it , we will have a larger trade surplus with Mexico than with any country in the entire world . " <p> So , did it play out as Gore asserted ? Not so much : <p> Did Al Gore know that the tiny surplus ( green bars ) that we had with Mexico would turn into a massive deficit because of NAFTA ? Of course he did ! He knew Perot was right . A chimpanzee could have seen this coming ! <p> But that , of course , is not the point . Al Gore was just doing his hatchet job and did n't  care how our deficit with Mexico would evolve . <p> Throughout history , a trade deficit was considered to be an alarming condition . Imagine that we were using gold for money , and every year we bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bought $60 billion of stuff from us . So , each year , the amount of gold in the USA would drop by $40 billion . Over time , our big pile of gold would migrate to Mexico . Mexico could then , if it desired , use that money to build an army and invade the USA . <p> Of course , today we are not on the gold standard , and globalists argue that worrying about the trade deficit should go the way of the horse-and-buggy . But instead of gold building up in many of our trading partners , dollars are building up . China has over $1 trillion in U.S. treasury bonds at the time of this writing . Not only do we have to pay them interest , but being that deep in debt to them gives Beijing what amounts to veto-power over U.S. policy . And they have used that veto to get away with manipulating their currency ( among other nefarious things ) for decades with no response from the U.S. Treasury . <p> In any case , you can tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that NAFTA would expand our trade surplus with Mexico . Then after the exact opposite happened , the globalists told us that trade deficits do n't  matter . Edward Conard has gone so far as to say ( Kindle 810 ) that " The trade deficit can grow forever . " Of course , whether the trade deficit is important or not is of no concern to the Oligarchy . They just want their sweatshop profits , and if it harms America , then America be damned . <p> Throughout the show , Gore talks down to the audience , speaking in a slow-motion , pedantic , insulting tone , as if he were addressing an audience of dunces . Which he undoubtedly considers the American people to be . <p> Item : Right at the beginning , Gore lies about the " side agreements " that were supposed to ensure civilized environmental and labor conditions in Mexico . Update : That never happened . Ironically , Mr. Granola contributed to a great deal of polluting in Mexico , Californias Salton Sea , and every other country , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Item : At 3:00 , Gore tells a story about a friend of his who is a tire worker , and a member of the United Rubber Workers . Gore said that his friend had studied NAFTA and was supporting it because it would help his company sell more tires to Mexico . Update : In 2009 , President Obama had to put a 35% tariff on Chinese tires to save American jobs . <p> Item : At 5:33 , Perot shows an amazing photo of a U.S. factory ( maquiladora ) in Mexico surrounded by a shantytown . The shantytown was n't there before ; it sprang up around the factory because the workers werent paid enough to live in houses or apartments . The workers built their shanties out of cardboard boxes discarded from the plant . Note : some U.S. factories were moved to Mexico before NAFTA as part of a pilot project . <p> Item : At 6:09 , Perot says that American farm animals enjoy better living conditions than maquiladora workers . <p> Item : At the beginning of the video , Gore claims that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven . Said Gore : " We know this works . " <p> Item : At 0:27 , Gore claims that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 caused the Great Depression . Note : At that time , exports were a tiny part of the U.S. economy only $5.9 billion while GDP was $103.6 billion . The idea that higher tariffs could cause the Great Depression is ridiculous . See this page for more . <p> Item : At 0:53 , Perot says : " Here is the NAFTA game : buy U.S. manufacturing companies cheap , right after NAFTA passes , that are labor intensive , that make good products , that have marginal profits . Close the factories in the U.S. , move the factories to Mexico , take advantage of the cheap labor , run your profits through the roof , sell the companys stock at a profit , go get another one . " <p> Item : At 6:45 , Perot criticizes Mexican violent union-busting . He said that when workers went on strike , American companies called in Mexican police to beat and kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages . <p> Item : At 8:16 , Perot criticizes the brutality of Mexicos oligarchy and ruling PRI party . He predicts that the PRI will fall from power . Update : the seemingly invincible PRI was dethroned seven years later . <p> Item : At 9:40 , Gore claims that better jobs in Mexico will " cut down on illegal immigration " into the USA . Update : over the next seven years it more than doubled from 370,000 to a record 770,000 according to the Pew Research Center . <p> Item : At 0:52 , Perot talks about a major U.S. chemical company that has a facility in Mexico where it simply buries toxic waste , and poisons the water supply . In the shantytown surrounding the plant , babies are born without brains . Gore nods in agreement . Note : Perot was apparently referring to the Stepan Chemical plant in Matamoras . See this page . <p> Item : At 4:23 , Gore says that the " side agreement " will allow us to compel Mexico to enforce its environmental laws " a major step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maquiladoras created a cesspool of horrific pollution and health conditions . <p> Item : At 3:54 , Gore says that we will sell lots of computers to Mexico after they drop their 20% tariff . Update : Today , thanks to " free trade , " we do n't  even make computers any more . We import all of our computers , cell phones , and electronic gadgets from Asia . Our televisions are assembled in Mexico from Asian parts . <p> Item : At 5:26 , Gore says : " We want to fight for working men and women , and NAFTA is part of it . " Update : Gore wins Biggest Lie Ever Told Award . <p> Item : At 6:30 , Perot proposes a " social tariff " to force the Mexicans to pay their workers better as Gore scoffs . Update : that suggestion was obviously never adopted , and according to Truthout , wages have declined in Mexico since NAFTA . <p> Item : At 7:10 , Gore says that it is " unrealistic " for us to insist that countries like Mexico treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the world . " Note : if Abraham Lincoln had that attitude , we would still have slave states . And Gore , of course , is wrong . Like Perot said , we could create a huge wave of change simply by making civilized standards a condition for access to our huge consumer market . <p> Item : At 8:25 , Gore says that cheap labor is not a factor when multinationals are deciding where to locate their factories , and U.S. products can compete with cheap-labor products because we have superior productivity . Update : Multinationals went for the cheap labor as if their heads were on fire , and high productivity did not save scores of entire U.S. industries from being wiped out . <p> Item : At 1:40 , Perot says to Gore : " Youre lying " after Gore said that Perot lobbied Congress more than anybody else during the period when Gore was a Congressman . Gores ad hominem attack was lame . Gore accused Perot of lobbying Congress twenty years prior , but could not provide any specifics even when Perot pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the worlds largest Walmart in Mexico City , and how it was selling American products like hotcakes to the Mexican people . Update : Maybe they were American products back then , but they are Chinese now . Walmart has systematically forced small American manufacturing companies to move their plants overseas in order to cut costs via cheap labor . <p> Item : At 5:45 , Gore says that General Motors moved jobs to Mexico , but then brought them back to the USA because U.S. workers are more productive . Update : Today , GM and many other multinationals operate large auto plants in Mexico . Mexico is the #8 auto-making nation in the world , ahead of industrial nations like the United Kingdom , Canada , and France . <p> Item : At 7:09 Perot says that Mexican companies had spent a fortune building textile plants in Cuba where labor costs were " next to nothing . " Note : He was apparently implying that cheap textiles from Cuba could get into the USA tariff-free via Mexico . <p> Item : At 7:25 , Perot says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them credit for . Update : Mexican auto plants are now considered to be just as good as American plants quality-wise . <p> Item : At 0:21 , Gore says : " We ought to thank our lucky stars that the Mexican people have had the vision and courage to strike out on the American path toward the ideas of Thomas Jefferson " Update : Mexico is nearly a failed state , thanks to drug violence , and is a huge geopolitical problem for the USA now . Many small Mexican farmers were forced to switch to drug crops after NAFTA allowed big , and tax-payer subsidized , American farms to flood Mexico with cheap food . Nobody is " thanking their lucky stars , " and as we will discuss later , there was no " vision " involved ; Mexico was forced into NAFTA by American bankers . <p> Item : At 4:35 , Perot says that if we continue to de-industrialize , we wont be able to militarily defend the USA . Update : That prediction came true in Iraq when we could n't produce enough bomb-proof steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The blame for soldiers that were killed and maimed can be laid at the door of globalists like Al Gore . <h> Conclusion <p> Just about everything Gore claimed and predicted turned out to be completely wrong . Perots predictions all came true , except for the one about how the American people would never allow de-industrialization to go so far as to inhibit our national defense . Sadly , he was wrong about that . <p> In retrospect , we can see why Perot and the Reform Party were defeated : the system had gone from fighting the Soviets to fighting the American people . And to this day , we Americans remain a conquered people , ruled by a rapacious oligarchy . <p> Note : Sir James Goldsmith was sort-of Perots British counterpart . British and European readers might be interested in his book " The Trap " which he wrote in 1993 . <h> Blood in the Water <p> NAFTA was resisted by the right ( Pat Buchanan ) , the center ( Ross Perot ) , the left ( Ralph Nader ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But once thousands of factories and millions of jobs began pouring into Mexico from the USA , and fat profits rolled into oligarch coffers it was too late . Blood was in the water , and a feeding frenzy of more " free trade " developments quickly followed . <p> The " Asian Flu " Financial Crisis of 1997 had a similar effect as the Latin American Debt Crisis . Countries with shattered economies such as South Korea and Thailand turned to David Rockefellers " Export to America " plan , and with the help of the " General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade " ( GATT ) , even more cheap products poured into the USA . <p> The USAs economy is huge , and while NAFTA and GATT cut deep , they werent enough to bring us down . However , the death blow came on December 11 , 2001 when the USA brought China into the World Trade Organization . Prior to that , " free trade " with China was contentious because it was a communist country that perpetrated numerous human-rights violations , including the Tiananmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China because Congress might sever relations . <p> Admission into the WTO dispelled those worries , and made China a sure thing . The multinationals dove in , and with its gigantic , impoverished population , China was able to " accept " a much larger chunk of our industry than Mexico ever could . Less than a decade later , the USAs economy lay in ruin . <p> Unlike the OPEC nations , the Chinese did not leave their cash on deposit with western banks . Instead , they invested it themselves , and it was their particular choice of investment that determined the precise characteristics of Americas fall . <h> Offshoring Caused the Financial Crisis of 2008 <p> Some people blame the financial crisis on rogue bankers ; some blame the government backing of subprime loans , and some blame Alan Greenspan for keeping interest rates too low . However , the finical crisis would have never occurred at all if trillions of dollars had not been gouged out of the middle class and sent to China . <p> Think about what happens when General Electric moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their American workers and stop paying them . Those dollars are no longer spent by the American workers in the USA , but rather go to China . Now think about what happens when that scenario is repeated for tens of thousands of factories : a huge economic tidal wave is created . <p> And what did the Chinese do with their newfound wealth ? They were very conservative ; they invested in what were the safest instruments in the world : U.S. government bonds . However , the U.S. government does n't  issue bonds to satisfy the demand in the bond market . It only issues bonds when it needs to borrow money . If the budget is balanced , as it was during the Clinton years , the government simply does n't  need to issue many new bonds . <p> Of course , GE also made huge profits in this example by reducing its payroll . And corporations also put cash into government bonds . <p> So , one of the consequences of offshoring was to dramatically increase the demand for government bonds . What did the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury bonds to go around ? They bought the next best thing : mortgage bonds from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ( " agency bonds " or just " agencies " ) because they were backed by the U.S. government . <p> That flood of money dramatically depressed interest rates , and blew up the housing bubble . The vast size of the U.S. housing bubble was directly proportional to the amount of money extracted from the hides of middle-class households by offshoring . <p> The flaws in our banking system would probably not have been fatal absent this vast re-engineering of the U.S. economy . And there would have been no crisis because American workers spend their money differently than the Chinese . We are notorious spenders and the Chinese are notorious savers . Think of a union auto worker . What did he do with his paycheck ? Buy treasury bonds , or a new boat ? <p> In a 2005 speech , Ben Bernanke dubbed this phenomena as the " savings glut . " Of course , China and other countries also build-up dollar reserves by simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own currencies weak , and exports to the USA going strong . So , its not just a cultural preference , but also a premeditated , mercantilist , economic attack on the USA . <p> Perhaps Alan Greenspan did keep rates too low for too long . However , that was right in the middle of the mass exodus of factories and jobs to China . Can Greenspan be blamed for using a traditional economic-stimulation method that had historically worked well in our relatively closed-borders economy ? The simple fact is that Greenspan would not have kept his foot on the gas pedal so long if the multinationals were not transferring all the jobs to China . <p> And when Greenspan finally did raise rates , long-term rates stayed low . The housing bubble defied Greenspans attempt to pop it because of the tidal wave of middle-class money that was being redistributed through China . That was Greenspans famous " conundrum . " However , even if he had figured out the cause , could he have done anything about it ? After all , the Fed has no control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people blame our lackluster economy on the financial crises . They say that recessions caused by banking crises require more time for recovery . Many complicated theories have been put forth . But why do n't  we just use Occams Razor and look for the simplest explanation ? The jobs are n't  here because we sent them away ! <p> The globalists tampered with the natural order of things , and caused a huge financial catastrophe , mass unemployment , and mass poverty in what had previously been a fabulously wealthy nation . <p> Of course , as we saw above , Wall Street bankers are far from innocent . While the subprime-mortgage crisis was a consequence of globalization , it was David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank who could fairly be named the " Father of Globalization . " <p> Rockefellers dumb loans lead directly to the Latin American Debt Crisis of the 1980s , which was very similar to the subprime-mortgage crisis of 2008 . Back then , it was OPEC , rather than China , that gouged a huge amount of money from consumers in the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the USA in a huge tidal wave , but instead of it going into bonds , it went into bank deposits . The banks then immediately squandered the money by loaning it to Third World nations like Brazil , Mexico , and Argentina . Just like they totally miss-managed the wave of money that came in from China thirty years later . <p> The moral of the story is that it is imperative that we prevent these mass extractions of wealth from consumers . The damage to individuals is bad enough , and the banks have proven , more than once , and in spectacular fashion , that they have no clue how to manage the tidal waves of " liberated " middle-class funds . Perhaps the middle class has been so deeply damaged that there can be no more such tidal waves . Or maybe the privatization of Social Security will be that last great looting spree for the American Oligarchy . Time will tell . <p> The Oligarchy came out of the Great Recession smelling like a rose . Their captive government in Washington bailed them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oligarchy even got more " free trade " deals with South Korea , Colombia , and Panama . And the Oligarchy can soar even higher simply because there is still meat on the middle-class bone to be picked . <p> " We are still a democracy , but we have moved in my lifetime towards a plutocracy . We do not have a plutocracy , I want to emphasize that , but the distribution of wealth and the influence of wealth have moved in that direction . " <p> Buffett uses the word " plutocracy , " which is pretty much the same thing as " oligarchy . " An oligarchy is a form of government where a small number of ( usually ) rich people hold all the power . The reason why Buffett is wrong is because the American people oppose globalization , mass immigration , and the liquidation of the middle class . And yet these polices go full-steam ahead , generating profits for a small number of multinational corporations . So , it is fair to describe the USA as an oligarchy . And as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy of oligarch sharks devouring the middle class . <p> The people listed here are leaders of this oligarchic system , so it is fair to label them as oligarchs . To be clear though , advocating this form of government is not a crime . Many oligarchs truly believe that their system is actually good for all people . They are delusional , of course . <p> ( Note : this is not a comprehensive list ; an entire book could be written with profiles like the ones below . ) <h> David Rockefeller Founding Father of the Oligarchy , Framer of Globalism <p> As we saw above , Rockefeller takes credit for constructing NAFTA . As a banker who had made dumb loans to Latin American governments , he cheerfully sold out the American middle-class to extricate himself . <p> Since Rockefellers grandfather , John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland in 1870 , nobody in the Rockefeller clan had written an autobiography until David published his Memoirs in 2002 . Most of the book is very boring , dealing with sibling rivalries , details of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there are some astounding admissions in Chapter 27 " Proud Internationalist " and Chapter 28 " South of the Border . " Here is perhaps the most amazing confession ( Kindle global political and economic structure one world , if you will . If that 's the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . " <p> One wonders if Rockefeller would have been so proud if he had been writing after the Financial Crisis of 2008 when his global " economic structure " collapsed like a house of cards , and mass poverty exploded across the USA . <p> Rockefellers design also created the USAs massive trade deficit . However , before Rockefeller needed to turn the USA into a dumping ground for his sweatshop products to save his bacon , he held a traditional view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a deficit . In a 1962 letter to President Kennedy , he wrote : <p> " The major gain has occurred in our trade account and has been reflected in the rise in our exports since mid-1959 . While imports also have advanced , it appears that we shall , nevertheless , realize a favorable balance on trade this year of $4 to $5 billion . " <p> As a child , Rockefeller was an obese , " socially awkward " bug collector , ignored by his four older brothers . Perhaps that is responsible for his " Napoleon Complex . " Rockefeller spent nearly his entire career at Chase Manhattan Bank , however , he was never a trained loan officer . When the rich kid waltzed in , the real bankers at Chase were skeptical of his ability to lead the company , and they were right . Rockefeller never took the time to become proficient at lending , and nearly burned the place down . He was more interested in jet-setting around the world doing amateur diplomacy . He was very keen on symbolic gestures like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow or Beijing almost as if he were opening embassies instead of banks . <p> To this day , modern oligarchs imitate Rockefeller , spending a tremendous amount of time flying around the word holding conferences with each other , taking photos of themselves , no doubt name-dropping like verbal machine guns . Here is a quote from Memoirs ( Kindle 5994 ) , that todays oligarchs likely aspire to : <p> " We enjoyed the experience of eating Central Asian bustards , snared by Sheik Zayeds falcons in Pakistan , cooked in Bahrain , and finally consumed by a carload of hungry Chase bankers on a hillside in Yemen ! " <p> This is the problem with oligarchs running the world : they are too busy indulging in preposterous ego trips when they should be studying and practicing good governance . <p> Paddy Chayefsky may have had Rockefeller in mind when creating his Arthur Jensen character in Network . Jensen is the executive that commands Howard Beale to stop his " mad as hell " tirades : <p> " The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is ebb and flow , tidal gravity , it is ecological balance ! " <p> Chayefsky was prophetic because nearly thirty years later Rockefeller wrote pretty much the same thing in his Memoirs ( Kindle 5738 ) : <p> " It was imperative that some way be found to pump that capital back into the oil-consuming nations to " recycle " the petrodollars , or recession and stagnation might turn into a full-blown worldwide depression . " <p> " The 1976 movie " Network " does not exaggerate when it describes corporate media as an extension of state power . " <p> David Rockefeller was not a media mogul , however NAFTA was clearly an Oligarchy project , and as we discussed above , other " Arthur Jensen " types kept Ross Perots anti-NAFTA commercials off of the television networks during the heat of the battle . <h> Walter Wriston Architect of the Oligarchy <p> As we discussed above in Dark Art #10 , former Citicorp CEO , Walter Wriston was a top oligarch . He wrote " The Twilight of Sovereignty " in 1992 , no doubt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wriston loaned billions of OPEC dollars to Latin American nations , and Citibank barely survived the ensuing Latin American Debt Crisis . ( Read more in " Citibank : Teetering Since 1812 " at Time.com . ) <p> Regulators looked the other way ( " forbearance " ) as Citibank struggled to regain solvency . If it had n't  been for Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal buying 14.9% of the company for $797 million in 1991 , Citibank might have gone under , or more precisely stayed under . Bankers like Wriston and Rockefeller used NAFTA to enforce an involuntary bailout of their banks . They sent American middle-class jobs to Mexico so that the Mexican government could generate dollars to pay off their bank loans . <p> Wriston wrote another book in 2007 titled , " Bits , Bytes , and Balance Sheets . " In the very first paragraph , he warns us about " overregulation " of business . That 's right ; a banker was warning about too much regulation only one year before the Financial Crisis of 2008 . Talk about clueless <h> The Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens of the robber-baron industrialist type who promulgate libertarian ideology to keep their payroll- and toxic-waste costs down . According to The New Yorker , the Kochs have given over $100 million to right wing &amp; libertarian organizations . <p> The Kochs are not as famous as other billionaires because their company , Koch Industries , is privately held , and they prefer to keep a low profile . However , they are very active behind the scenes . So much so that they are called the Kochtopus . See this page for an exhaustive list of their activities . <p> David Koch was the Vice Presidential candidate on the 1980 Libertarian Party ticket with Ed Clark as the Presidential candidate . As a candidate , there was no legal limit on how much Koch could spend , so spend he did , and that was the best showing ever for the Libertarian Party as they captured 1.06% of the popular vote . ( See statistics here . ) Koch did not enjoy his political experience , and has worked behind the scenes ever since . <p> The Kochs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Rothbard because a truly small government could not do them any favors . Rather , the Kochs support the Friedrich-Hayek flavor of " flexible " libertarianism . This Chicago School of economics provides a free-market fig leaf to the Oligarchy ; an intellectual fatade for their dirty deeds . <h> Warren Buffett Folksy Oligarch <p> Warren Buffett is widely regarded as one of the good guys . He is famous for saying : <p> In August 2011 , he wrote an op-ed for the New York Times : " Stop Coddling the Super-Rich " and recommended higher taxes on rich people . However , as we saw above , Buffett financed the 1985 " big bang " of media concentration : the CIA-assisted takeover of ABC by Capital Cities . <p> More recently , in 2012 , Buffett invested $10.7 billion in IBM . Up until that time , Buffett had been famous for not investing in technology companies , proclaiming that he did n't  understand them . And then boom ! a massive investment in IBM . The investing world was shocked . It was almost as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffett all of a sudden understand technology companies ? No . Buffett made no such assertion . In fact , he was very vague as to why he bought the IBM shares . However , IBM had announced its intention to replace a huge percentage of its American workers with badly-paid Third-World workers , and was moving briskly toward that goal . <p> IBM was one of the USAs largest employers , fielding an army of well-paid middle-class information-technology ( IT ) workers . So , massive profits could be made over a period of many years by replacing those expensive workers with cheap labor from the Third World ( primarily India ) . The sheer number of Americans to be eliminated is key because a small company doing the same thing would n't be worth Buffetts time . <p> As we saw in Dark Art #2 , global labor arbitrage on IBMs scale is enormously profitable , and Buffetts investment in IBM proves that assertion . <p> IBM is a big advertiser , so if you look to the Oligarch Media for the story , you will hear nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published all of the gory details on his blog : <p> " Whenever IBM has a big project they now have to bring in extra workers , usually from India . They make sure there are never more than two or three workers coming on the same flight , effectively avoiding notice by Homeland Security . " <h> The Walton Family Top-Tier Oligarchs <p> Many American companies are forced to play the globalization game , or face being wiped-out by lower-priced competition . Walmart is not one of those companies . Walmart is not forced to play by the rules ; they have been writing the rules . More than any other company , Walmart has been the engine driving Ross Perots " giant sucking sound . " <p> Walmart was the pioneer of the low-wage/free-trade system of the American Oligarchy . Notorious for fighting unionization , it is less well known that Walmart lobbied hard for NAFTA and globalization . Walmart forces U.S. manufacturers to move to China in order to reduce prices , funds " Right to Work " organizations , operates " sweat warehouses , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Walmart has an incredibly high turnover rate . So much so that it needed to report the fact to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its 2010 10-K filing : " the companyexperiences significant turnover in employees each year . " Walmart did not mention an exact rate , but outside sources estimate 50-70% of workers quit within the first year . Walmart operates a " chew them up and spit them out " system as we discussed in Dark Art #6 . <p> The Mexico City Walmart was sort of a Potemkin Village used to sell NAFTA to the American people . ( See page 253 of To Serve God and Wal-Mart by Bethany Moreton . ) <p> A large chunk of the income of former middle-class Americans has been transferred to the Walton Family . Today , there are 46 million Americans living in poverty , and the six members of the Walton Family have more money than all of them combined . Many Walmart employees live below the poverty line . ( Read more here , and see Wikipedias Criticism of Walmart page . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privatize public schools . This would be another huge profit center as middle-class teachers are beat down to working class . <p> Walmart is the jet engine of the Oligarchy . <h> Jimmy Carter Political Enforcer <p> President Carter and Vice President Mondale were members of David Rockefellers Trilateral Commission . Their mission was to convince Japan and Germany to open their economies to imports from Latin American nations that owed money to Rockefeller . They failed . <h> Ronald Reagan Political Enforcer <p> Reagan was the figurehead of the " military industrial complex " faction of the Oligarchy . He disdained the **29;54;TOOLONG wing . He did n't  want to sell Coca-Cola to the Chinese ; he wanted to point missiles at them lots and lots of missiles . However , the Vietnam War was still fresh in American minds in 1980 , and the risk of escalating with the Soviet Union made even the smallest wars very risky . So , while Reagan did n't  actually invade any countries , aside from Grenada , he most certainly did come through with a huge amount of military spending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile import quotas on the Japanese , forced Japan and Germany to revalue their currencies , and employed Pat Buchanan as a senior advisor . Reagan slowed down the process of globalization . <p> The globalist wing of the Oligarchy was represented in the Reagan administration by " Rockefeller Republican " Vice President George H.W. Bush . However , Bush couldnt get busy on NAFTA until he became president in 1989 . When Bush ran for re-election in 1992 , Buchanan entered the race , and Bush denounced him as a protectionist . But even though Bush lost that race , the globalists did n't  lose because Clinton was a globalist too , and Clinton signed the NAFTA bill into law . <p> Its important to remember that both wings of the Oligarchy always have considerable " representation " in every administration . During the Reagan Administration , the banker wing was represented by former Merrill Lynch CEO Don Regan who was first Secretary of the Treasury and then White House Chief of Staff . In the infamous " speed it up " video , you can see Regan giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing in public ? He was clearly showing people who was boss . A man drunk on is own power , putting on a foolish display , not realizing that oligarchs must not flaunt their power over elected officials if they expect to survive . <h> George H.W. Bush Political Enforcer <p> President Bush signed the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada , and made David Rockefellers dream come true . <h> Bill Clinton Political Enforcer <p> Signed the NAFTA bill into law . Teamed up with Newt Gingrich to evolve GATT into the WTO . Brought China into the WTO . Bungled the deal with the Chinese who initially offered American companies the ability to hold a 51% controlling interest in Chinese companies . Clinton turned down that offer , and desperate to get the deal done for his legacy , had to crawl back to the Chinese who lowered their offer to 49% . Probably the most-destructive president in U.S. history . <h> Newt Gingrich Political Enforcer <p> Voted for NAFTA . As the " Speaker Elect , " he led the Republican effort in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advocated bringing back child labor during the Republican presidential primaries in 2012 . <h> George W. Bush Political Enforcer <p> Bush spent most of his administration invading various countries . He also supported Chinas entry into the WTO . <h> Grover Norquist Protector and Magician <p> Grover Norquist has convinced numerous Republican politicians to swear to his " Taxpayer Protection Pledge . " Disobedient politicians face defeat in their next elections at the hands of Norquists hordes of grass-roots voters . By convincing his gullible conservative followers to oppose all tax increases , he effectively hypnotized them into supporting the Oligarchy . Many oligarchs pay taxes at lower rates than Norquists followers . Multinational corporations funnel revenue through tax havens and pay very low rates . Norquist is their protector . <h> Al Gore Snake-Oil Salesman <p> Gore , and the slick marketing team behind him , defeated the more humble , down-to-earth Ross Perot , to get NAFTA passed . Today we know that nearly all of Gores statements were lies , many proving to be spectacularly so . <h> Barack Obama Political Enforcer <p> Obama campaigned against NAFTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade " to South Korea , Colombia , and Panama . He also pushed the NAFTA-like Trans-Pacific Partnership . Obama prevented the people from putting the bankers back in their cages during the Great Recession . He did the opposite of what FDR did during the Great Depression . <h> Larry Kudlow Ideological Enforcer <p> Most of the people who work for the Oligarch Media are simple propagandists dutifully reading the scripts scrolling down their teleprompters . But CNBCs Larry Kudlow will ruthlessly tear into any fellow Republican he thinks is straying from the oligarch party line . <p> Mark Cuban was watching CNBC during Mitt Romneys speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa , and was surprised when Kudlow tore into the candidates : <p> Cuban was expecting Kudlow to support his fellow Republicans . However , party affiliation means nothing to oligarchs . What counts is the oligarch party line , which is : " We should not be taxed or regulated ! " After all , how can one go about doing " gods work " when the " small people " are constantly nipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not forcefully demand more tax cuts for the rich . He was also upset with the usage of the phrase " tax fairness " in Paul Ryans speech , because that is code for raising taxes on the rich . <p> Kudlow , with no need of a teleprompter , vociferously campaigns for all the key points of the Oligarch Agenda : unrestricted offshoring of jobs , unlimited immigration , tax cuts for the rich and corporations , savage austerity for the " small people , " unlimited despoliation of the environment , the crushing of labor unions , the privatization of every government function , etc . If you want to know what the Oligarchys position is on current events , you can find out by watching Kudlow . <h> Thomas L. Friedman Snake-Oil Salesman <p> Just like Al Gore sold the snake oil of NAFTA to the American people in the early 1990s , so today does Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times sell us the snake oil of total globalization . Friedman preaches the literal dissolution of the USA into the global collective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were 46 million Americans on food stamps , Friedman wrote : <p> " Forget about outsourcing. In todays hyper-connected world , there is no in and no out. " <p> According to Friedman , only rubes and bumpkins believe in the " myth " of outsourcing . There is no " in " or " out " because there are no borders ; no USA only multinational corporations arranging the people of the globe to suit their profit margins . <p> On the right , Paul Ryan and The Wall Street Journal preach " Savage Austerity . " On the left , Thomas Friedman and The New York Times preach " Brutal Globalization . " Friedman kicks you out of the middle class , and when you request assistance , Ryan kicks you when you 're down . So , get used to it because this is the face of the Oligarchy . <p> " one brutal fact : The high-wage , medium-skilled job is over , as Stefanie Sanford , a senior education expert at the Gates Foundation , puts it . The only high-wage jobs , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring more and better education " <p> Friedmans " brutal fact " is no such thing . If he were honest , he would call it what it is : a brutal policy . The foundation of Friedmans propaganda effort is the Big Lie that globalization is an irreversible force of nature , like a tsunami that ca n't be stopped . It is no such thing . It is a policy being imposed upon the USA by the Oligarchy . It is no more a " fact " than were the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq sold to us by another snake oil salesman Colin Powell . <p> Friedman is actively propagating the " open immigration " meme , where " open " means " unlimited , " or " quantities sufficient to displace all Americans currently employed by Corporate America , " or " however many immigrant workers Corporate America wants . " <p> Here is what Friedman wrote in the New York Times on October 30 , 2012 ( link ) : <p> " And the Republican-dominated Chamber of Commerce here is leading the charge for open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from India to enrich its work force . " <p> Why is Friedman carrying on about this ? Because IBM has a huge facility in Rochester , Minnesota , and is a member of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce , and is scrubbing its staff clean of American citizens . Here is a video of Friedman lecturing at IBM where he asserts that American citizenship is worthless ( at the 28:22 mark ) : <p> " Get your kids to think like new immigrantsWe are all new immigrants today We are new immigrants to a hyper-connected world . And how does the new immigrant think ? He or she starts every day and says : Nothing is owed me . Nothing is owed me in this world . There is no legacy place waiting for me at IBM or Harvard or my state university " <p> Thomas Friedman wants you to teach your children that their American citizenship is of virtually no value ; that , economically , they have no priority over non-citizens . Friedman wants you to condition your children to accept their downgraded status . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 per hour sweatshop jobs and shantytown homes . That way , there will be fewer protests and strikes , which will reduce the security costs of the Oligarchy , along with the payroll costs of IBM . <h> Bob Lutz Minister of Hate <h> Peter G. Peterson Minister of Austerity <p> A dead giveaway that a person is an oligarch is that he advocates austerity always . After all , if benefits for the " small people " can be cut , then there is more room for tax cuts for the Oligarchy , or subsidies , or bailouts , or a splendid new war , etc . <p> For example , in 1974 President Nixon offered David Rockefeller the job of Secretary of the Treasury . Rockefeller turned down the offer because he did n't  want the bad publicity that the required " tough measures " would cause . 19 In 1978 , Rockefeller did the same thing when President Carter wanted to make him Federal Reserve Chairman . Rockefeller said that he would be forced to implement " draconian policies . " 20 <p> When David Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1985 , his crony Peter G. Peterson took over . In 2007 , Peterson became a billionaire after the initial public offering of his company , Blackstone Group , and Peterson had an epiphany he decided to dedicate himself , and his wealth , to the grand cause of austerity . As he explains in a Newsweek magazine column titled : " Why I 'm Giving Away $1 Billion " he set up The Peter G. Peterson Foundation with an incredible $1 billion endowment . <p> During the " Fiscal Cliff " crisis of 2012 , Peterson donated even more money to the austerity campaign . Here are some stories : <h> John A. Allison , IV Propagandist <p> Allison is the former CEO of BB&amp;T bank , and now head of the libertarian Cato Institute . Allison appears to be an earnest devotee to an invalid ideology . <h> Charlene Barshefsky Trade Negotiator <p> A member of the Trilateral Commission , and the Council on Foreign Relations , Barshefsky was the U.S. Trade Representative who negotiated the agreement with China that culminated in Chinas entry into the WTO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , but can be downloaded from this page . It is more of a spreadsheet than a treaty . <h> Bill Gates Colonizer <p> Bill Gates is doing a lot of good work via the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation . However , he has personally kicked thousands of Americans out of the middle class . Microsoft is a huge importer of cheap labor from India . In this video , you can see Gates testifying before Congress and calling for an " infinite " number of immigrants . <p> At 1:20 into the video , when asked how many H-1B visas he would like , Gates replies : <p> " My basic view is that an infinite number of people coming who are taking jobs that pay over $100,000 a year , they 're going to pay taxes , we create lots of other jobs around those people . My basic view is that the country should welcome as many of those people as we can get . " <p> Gates acts as if these would be new jobs . However , all of the available evidence shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with immigrants making far less . <p> At 3:05 , Gates says about limits on immigration : <p> " Thats sort of like a centrally-managed economy . " <p> This is a common refrain among oligarchs and their libertarian flunkies : that any sort of restriction on corporate behavior is tantamount to communist central planning . What Gates is really arguing for is anarcho-fascism where corporations do whatever the hell they want including destroying their host nations . <p> We do not need any of the H-1B workers Gates is demanding . For a detailed analysis of the work-visa programs , see this blog post by tech journalist Robert X. Cringely . <p> Bill Gates wants to re-colonize America with " better " people . And to the oligarchs , " better " means " works cheaper . " What will happen after Microsoft replaces all of its American workers with Indians ? They would start looking for even cheaper workers . Maybe the next wave would be Vietnamese , Indonesian , or Argentinean . Who knows ? In any case , the Indians already here should n't get too comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Conard The Oligarchys Ambassador to America <p> Edward Conard was a managing director of Mitt Romneys Bain Capital from 1993 until 2007 . In 2012 , he wrote a book titled : " Unintended Consequences : Why Everything Youve Been Told About the Economy is Wrong . " The title really means : " All the blame directed at the Oligarchy for the Financial Crisis of 2008 is wrong . " <p> The book is an astonishing defense of all the excesses perpetrated by the financial elite leading up to the crisis . It is astonishing not only because it is a flat-out endorsement of the Oligarchy , but because it claims that they can virtually do no wrong . In other words , the book is completely insane . However , it is important to study because it might be the closest thing that we have to a Rockefeller Manifesto . <p> Throughout his book , Conard rails against " income redistribution . " He acts as if redistribution only goes one way : from rich to poor . However , the policies he champions cause massive redistribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass immigration depresses wages for American workers and bloats-up corporate profits . Offshoring cuts the income of affected workers to zero , redistributing even more wealth into corporate profits . <p> Conard would retort that the income of American workers was " artificial " in the first place because artificial barriers protected them from being paid an " equilibrium " wage . What barriers are those ? Trade and immigration barriers . You know , a little thing called American sovereignty . <p> Conard is an enemy of the policies that created the American middle class . And he is completely oblivious to the fact that income is always redistributed . Immigration and trade policies are political questions with a wide scale of possible settings any of which will result in different types of income redistribution . <p> Think about it like this : Suppose you are gold miner and have discovered a vein of gold in the countryside . You need a gang of men to mine the vein . How should the profits of the work be split ? Since you found the gold and own the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get 50% and the workers would split up the other 50% . More likely , you would just go into town and hire workers at the going rate . <p> Now suppose that times are good and unemployment is low . Everybody has a job , so to hire your men , you need to offer them substantially higher wages than they are already getting . Once you strike deals with each man , you calculate that your profit will only be 40% . You are disappointed , but you mine the gold anyway . The project is a success , and everybody involved makes a nice profit . <p> Then you locate another vein . This time around , you vow to make a higher profit . Why should you pay high wages to the local prima-donna workmen ? There is news of a famine in Portugal , and your eyes light up . You think : " Ka-Ching ! Starving people will work cheap ! " Filled with excitement , you fly to Portugal , hire a crew for pennies on the dollar , fly them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They mine your gold , you make a 90% profit , fire the workers , who then shuffle into town to apply for food stamps . <p> Congratulations ! You have executed a splendid redistribution of wealth ! Wages that would have otherwise been paid to U.S workers , are now safely ensconced in you Cayman Islands account . And all that you had to do was violate American sovereignty . You get an A+ in Oligarchy 101 Principles of Evading Sovereignty . <p> Of course , in real life , you might use H1-B visas , student " guest worker " programs , or illegal immigrants already here . But the Conard principal is the same : use the global surplus of people to redistribute wealth from American workers to oligarchs even if you have to erase the USAs borders in the process . <p> Conard believes that we should worship the Oligarchy because they are on top of the heap for good reason ( Kindle 185 ) : <p> " Survival of the fittest ruthlessly prunes away less capable alternatives , ensuring that only the most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to offer improvements , and scrutinize them carefully for unintended consequences . " <p> And the Oligarchy was indeed " skeptical " of the " proposals " that created the middle class . So much so that they planned a fascist coup against President Roosevelt . Today , Conard carries on that fight against what remains of the middle class . <p> Like many oligarchs , the robot-like Conard ticks some boxes on the PCL-R psychopathology test . In this New York Times interview , Conard ticks the " emotionally shallow " box : <p> " God did n't  create the universe so that talented people would be happy . Its not beautiful . Its hard work . Its responsibility and deadlines , working till 11 oclock at night when you want to watch your baby and be with your wife . Its not serenity and beauty . " <p> Working hard to achieve ones goals is admirable . But working hard for the sake of working hard is the result of brainwashing . And that is what the Oligarchy demands of , not only its peons , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is nearly the same attitude that was the motto of the Auschwitz concentration camp : " Arbeit macht frei " " work makes you free . " <p> Conard is also an " internet denier . " He scoffs at the federal governments role in developing the internet . At 18:30 into his C-SPAN interview , Conard says : <p> " I 'm skeptical of itWhen you think about the internet , think about all the commercialization of it that 's occurred since 1992 or 1993 when they came up with the browsers . Almost all of that has been done by private enterprise . Very little of itwas done by the government . " <p> Sure , but that commercialization could not have happened without the infrastructure being invented in the first place . Its like denying that the road is of any importance to the shops now thriving on it . This is a typical arrogant oligarch attitude . <p> There 's plenty more to say about Conard . In fact , he wrote so many crazy things in his book , that another entire book could be written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sneak a huge $1 million campaign contribution to Mitt Romney via a dummy corporation , but was forced to fess up by watchdogs . <p> On June 6 , 2012 , Conard was on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . Conard won the debate with the liberal Stewart who totally failed to provide resistance to several ridiculous points asserted by Conard . The interview is in three parts : Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 . <h> Ayn Rand Patron Saint of the Oligarchy <p> Ayn Rand did not invent laissez faire capitalism , however she popularized it with her novel , Atlas Shrugged , and thereby did more to return the Oligarchy to a position of nearly absolute power than anybody else . Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957 . Thirty years later , the ideological movement that followed culminated in Alan Greenspan being appointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1987 . <h> Alan Greenspan The Oligarchys Referee <p> Greenspan was one of Ayn Rands inner circle , and read Atlas Shrugged as Rand was writing the book . Greenspan removed many restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international trading system that would send a tidal wave of former middle-class money at the U.S. financial system . Rockefeller created the hurricane , and Greenspan took down the storm shutters . Greenspan refereed the Financial Oligarchys games , but never called a single penalty . He enabled , and presided over a system of near financial anarchy . <h> Phil Gramm Political Enforcer <p> Phil Gramm was an economics professor before he entered politics as a Democrat . He later switched to the Republican Party , and was the driving force in turning the banksters loose on America . The Senators " Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act " of 1999 repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which had kept the banksters caged since the Great Depression . Gramm was also instrumental in getting the " Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 " passed . That bill created the CDS casino business and was a huge factor in the Financial Crisis of 2008 . We will discuss these disastrous laws further in the " Dethroning the Bankers " section below . <h> The Republican Party The Grand Oligarchy Party <p> Much of the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party . After all , David Rockefellers globalization program was mostly implemented by Bill Clinton . However , the " Party of Lincoln " has become a flat-out advocate of the Oligarchy . Democrats worry about our headlong plunge toward a two-class society . But the Republicans cheer it on , among other things , waging a viscous scorched-earth campaign against what remains of private-sector labor unions . The Republicans even nominated a rapacious , carpetbagging oligarch , Mitt Romney , as their presidential candidate in 2012 . <p> Aristotle taught that there were three basic forms of government : 1 ) Oligarchy , which is rule by the rich , 2 ) mob rule by the poor , and 3 ) middle-class rule . Aristotle believed that middle-class rule was the best . From Chapter XI of his Politics : <p> " The middle state is therefore best , as being least liable to those seditions and insurrections which disturb the community " <p> Aristotle thought that when wealth is spread more evenly , people get along better . <h> A Middle Class Society Must Be Deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " a government has never been established where the supreme power has been placed amongst those of the middling rank , or very seldom " <p> What 's fascinating about this ancient observation is that substantial statistical support for it was found by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in 1909 . Here is how Paretos discovery was described by the inventor of fractal geometry , Benoit Mandelbrot , in his book " The Misbehavior of Markets " ( page 153 ) : <p> " One of Paretos equations achieved special prominence , and controversy . He was fascinated by problems of power and wealth . How do people get it ? How is it distributed around society ? How do those who have it use it ? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition , but Pareto resolved to measure it . He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries , through different countries : the tax records of Basel , Switzerland , from 1454 and from Augsburg , Germany in 1471 , 1498 and 1512 ; contemporary rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saxony , Ireland , Italy , Peru . What he found or thought he found was striking . When he plotted the data on graph paper , with income on one axis , and number of people with that income on the other , he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era . Society was not a " social pyramid " with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next . Instead it was more of a " social arrow " very fat on the bottom where the mass of men live , and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite . Nor was this effect by chance ; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve , as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly . " It is a social law " , he wrote : something " in the nature of man . " <p> Mandelbrot thought that Paretos formula was " a marvel , " and summarized it ( page 157 ) : <h> Naturally-Occurring Oligarchy <p> Paretos discovery might be developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coin a phrase ) because extreme wealth easily translates into political power . This phenomena is crucial because it teaches us that we can not just sit back and wait for a middle-class society to materialize of its own accord . That a middle-class society must be purposely constructed , and that once established , vigilantly maintained . <p> We Americans have been conditioned to believe that our middle class was a natural development from the laissez-faire economics of our early history . And that is exactly what the oligarchs want you to believe . But in reality , the American middle-class was constructed with a conscious rejection of laissez-faire economics . And today , laissez-faire economics is being used to tear down the middle class . <p> That 's the bad news . The good news is that we know how to create a prosperous middle class because we already did it ; and the project was an astonishing success . Like Judith Stein said in the quote above , the middle class was cultivated . By who , you ask ? Well , certainly not the Oligarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a source of development funds by a progressive income tax . <h> How the Middle Class was Built <p> " The aftermath of World War II was even more decisive in ending the Depression . After the war ended , a series of laws was created that allowed returning soldiers to buy homes on credit , easily finance a college education , and become white-collar professionals . The federal government built an interstate highway system , opening up the areas around cities for residential construction . These measures constituted a vast transfer of wealth , spurring growth in factory and office work and maintaining wartime economic gains . The American middle class was born . Roosevelts reforms dictated by World War II were aimed at supporting the urban working class . They turned the ethnic working classes children into middle-class suburbanites . " <p> In order to restore a middle-class America , we do not need to invent anything new . Rather , we only need to look back at our history , and examine the policies that created the middle class . And that middle-class marvel was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't  matter how advanced your freshly-minted , GI-Bill degree is if there are a thousand other job applicants clutching similar diplomas in the waiting room of every job interview that you go to . <h> An Artificial Scarcity of People <p> " Within this present generation , that stream from abroad has largely stopped . We have within our shores today the materials out of which we shall continue to build an even better home for liberty . " <p> Bet you never heard that quote before , right ? But its true , liberal icon Franklin Delano Roosevelt stopped immigration almost completely during the Great Depression , and was satisfied to keep it that way . Only 23,068 immigrants came into the USA on FDRs watch during all of 1933 , and the decade of the 1930s had the lowest immigration since the continental United States was geographically constructed . Today , FDR would be considered a racist fascist . But he was right ; we did indeed have enough people to build the worlds most-powerful nation as subsequent events proved . <p> Whether or not modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the foundation for the construction of the American middle class . The man laid down the very bedrock itself . Even the Oligarchys Ambassador to America , Edward Conard admits as much : <p> The very last thing that Conard and the Oligarchy want is a restricted supply of labor , let alone wage growth ! No . The Oligarchy is very clear about its desire for Marxs Reserve Army of Labor . This is why they love nations with vast seas of impoverished peasants like China , India , and Mexico . They want workers on their knees , begging for jobs in order to feed their starving children . A man with starving children will work for almost nothing . <p> Our experience with restricted immigration during the Great Depression is a proven policy for creating a middle class . Irrefutable . Cold . Hard . Fact . Diamond hard . Speaking of which Just as the supply of diamonds is artificially restricted to make the gems more valuable , so too must we restrict the supply of Americans in a world where the number of humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purposes . <p> Geopolitical expert George Friedman wrote in " The Next 100 Years " ( page 120 ) : <p> " In the 1920s , the world was in the midst of an accelerating population explosion . The problem facing the United States , and the world , was what to do with an ever-increasing pool of labor . Labor was cheap , and it tended to move to countries that were wealthy . The United States , facing an onslaught of potential immigrants , decided to limit their entry in order to keep the price of labor wages from plunging . " <p> And it worked . Like a champ . And we can do it again . <p> However , the Oligarchy has other plans for its conquered American province . Here is Conard ( Kindle 824 ) on the global masses : <p> " If their labor was free , how much of it should we buy ? All of it . At seventy-five cents an hour , it is effectively free . At that price , surely we can find better uses for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor . " <p> The Oligarchy is doing the exact opposite of what has been historically proven to create a middle class . Conards statement is a smoking gun that the middle class is being systematically dismantled . And the transition to the low-cost tractor was n't exactly painless . The " Grapes of Wrath " era of American history was no walk in the park for displaced farmers . In fact , over-eager adoption of mechanized farming caused catastrophic environmental damage to the Great Plains turning the area into the notorious Dust Bowl . <p> Now , George Friedman went on to write : <p> " The population surge is abating , and people are living longer . This leads to an older population , with fewer younger workers . It means that the United States will be short of workers no later than 2020and will need immigrants to fill the gap . " <p> Let 's suppose that this is true , and that our persistent unemployment problem will somehow be solved by 2020 . That does n't  change the fact that the Oligarchys policy is evil . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire destroys their financial condition . To see some real-life stories , watch Dan Rather Reports No Thanks for Everything . For example , Diane Drozdowski was making a $48,000 salary as an SQL programmer at American Express . The company then brought two un-skilled men from India to replace her . The Indians said that they were being paid $10,000 each . Drozdowski was required to train them and was then fired . Notice that her replacements do n't  make enough money to meaningfully contribute to the Social Security system if they are contributing at all . ( Note : SQL is a database programming language . ) <p> We may need to actively recruit immigrants in the future to support the baby-boom generation in retirement . But that is not why the Oligarchy has brought the wave of immigrants . They have brought the wave to ruthlessly monetize the middle class . <p> The infamous Triangle Shirtwaist sweatshop fire occurred in 1911 during a period of mass immigration because when workers are plentiful , burning up a few is just a routine business expense . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the next boat from the old country . <p> That is why we have no " limiting principle " for legal immigration . To an oligarch , you can never have too much cannon fodder . <h> Chinese Disease <p> To see how the oligarchs rationalize their destruction of the American middle class , consider this quote from journalist Chrystia Freelands book " Plutocrats " ( Kindle 4238 ) : <p> " I heard a similar sentiment from the Taiwanese-born , 30-something CFO of a U.S. Internet company . A gentle , unpretentious man who went from public school to Harvard , he s nonetheless not terribly sympathetic to the complaints of the American middle class . " We demand a higher paycheck than the rest of the world , " he told me . " So if you 're going to demand 10 times the paycheck , you need to deliver 10 times the value . It sounds harsh , but maybe people in the middle class need to decide to take a pay cut . " <p> The communist Chinese regime learned about sweatshops from their cousins on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They saw their failing communist system , and Taiwans profitable sweatshop system . So , the Taiwanese-born CFO in the quote above is suffering from " Chinese Disease " where the concept of a middle class is weird and alien . He just does n't  get it . He acts as if the ocean of cheap labor is a recent development , which it most certainly is not . We Americans solved the problem over 150 years ago . Consider this quote from the 1851 book " The Harmony of Interests : Agriculture , Manufacturing , and Commercial " written by economist Henry C. Carey : <p> " Two systems are before the world One looks to underworking the Hindoo , and sinking the rest of the world to his level ; the other to raising the standard of man throughout the world to our level . " <p> The global surplus of labor has been around almost as long as the industrial revolution itself . We Americans found the cure for Chinese Disease : protectionism , which not only allowed us to industrialize rapidly , but also enabled us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However it occurs , overpopulation is dehumanizing . The fact that we have created overpopulation on purpose is an appalling betrayal of the American people , and the root cause of the increased brutality found in American workplaces . <h> End Global Labor Arbitrage <p> The globalists like to argue that we do n't  have to worry about labor arbitrage any more because global wages will soon reach an " equilibrium level . " For example , Chinese wages will rise , and American wages will fall , until they reach a stable , matching level . But if that does happen , it will be by U.S. wages doing the bulk of the adjusting . Downward . Drastically . <p> The Oligarchy did n't  go to all that trouble of building sweatshops in low-wage nations for nothing . They built them there with expectations that brutal host governments would see to it that wages stayed low . And so they have . While the Mexican economy has grown dramatically ( at the expense of the USA ) thanks to globalization , the 2010 Mexican Census found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is $1.69 per hour . <p> Nevertheless , this will remain an important propaganda talking-point for the Oligarchy . But rest assured , their intention is to drive U.S. wages down to the " global rate " of $2 per hour . <p> In a world with 7 billion people , none of us will live to see the day when Third World wages rise to current American standards . And even if global labor arbitrage did come to an end , that would not change the fact that 47 million people have piled-up on the food-stamp rolls . The mass poverty caused by the arbitrage does n't  just disappear it remains , waiting for justice . <p> Some things never change . The same " wages will rise automatically " logic was used in 1930 when chain stores first arrived in the Midwest . Small businessmen fought a long political battle to turn back the big stores , and The Nation magazine editorialized 25 : <p> " The wages in chain stores for employees other than managers are inadequate and will eventually be raised . The chains will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labor well . " <p> We are still waiting for Walmart to " realize " it . Waiting for equilibrium is equivalent to waiting for the pauperization of American workers . <h> Progressive Taxation <p> Modern-day Republicans recoil in horror at the idea of progressive taxation ( a.k.a. " taxing the rich " ) but that wasnt always the case . In fact , Republican president Teddy Roosevelt pushed hard for progressive taxes throughout his administration , and such taxes became law during the administration of his hand-picked successor , Republican president William Howard Taft . The 16th Amendment to the Constitution establishing the income tax was ratified on February 3 , 1913 while Taft was still president . <p> For example , in a speech on April 14 , 1906 , Roosevelt said : <p> " It is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes , and the use of those fortunes , both corporate and individual , in business . " <p> However , Roosevelt explicitly rejected socialism in his 1907 State of the Union Address : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideaSuch a theory , if ever adopted , would mean the ruin of the entire country " <p> Only four years after the 16th Amendment was adopted , the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia . So , as history shows , we can conclude that the Progressive Republican approach to the problem of naturally-occurring oligarchy was far superior to the Russian solution . <p> Modern Republicans fear that the proceeds of progressive taxation will fuel socialism ; the fruits of their oligarch patrons being simply transferred to a permanent freeloader class . And this is indeed an important question : what is to be done with the additional revenue ? However , the answer is simple : investment in the nation . Infrastructure , basic research , improved education , etc . <p> Republican President Eisenhower used the proceeds of the 92% top income-tax rate to build the interstate highway system . You do n't  see many Republicans arguing with that project . Today , nobody argues that our infrastructure is in need of a massive overhaul . So , there 's our first great project . <p> For many on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat the problem of naturally-occurring oligarchy . And that might be true in a closed system . However , in a wide-open globalized system such as we have today , the oligarchs will simply move to a more accommodating jurisdiction and continue to devour the American middle class from afar . Thus , further measures are required . <h> Deglobalization Ending the Oligarchys Looting Spree <p> Its painfully obvious that globalization has been a disaster for the American people . It has been a great success for the Oligarchy , but has wrecked the middle class , and devastated the working class . It is time that we admit the failure and put an end to it . <p> It is important to understand that this does not mean ending international trade . It merely means that we renegotiate our trade agreements to make them work for all of the American people , rather than just a handful of oligarchs . <p> Globalization and international trade are not synonymous . Legitimate trade is when the USA sells earth-movers to Saudi Arabia , and Saudi Arabia sells oil to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globalization is when the earth-mover plant is moved to Mexico for the sole purpose of reducing payroll expenses , and the earth-movers are then re-imported into the USA . That harms the USA , and is flat-out looting by the oligarchs who set it in motion . <p> So , the entire edifice of our trade treaties must be revoked and renegotiated . We should immediately announce our exit from the WTO , NAFTA , etc . Such a transition will not be easy , and should not be done abruptly . In fact , we could not do it abruptly even if we wanted to . It would be very painful to be suddenly cut off from Chinese electronics , Mexican cars , or Italian eyeglasses . <p> Re-industrializing will be a huge job spanning many years , and will require a great deal of scholarly debate to choose the best strategy . Perhaps a good approach would be to declare a " sunset " date for all of our free-trade agreements ten years hence . That will give industry time to plan and adjust . To spur things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% , to be raised 1% per year for the next ten years . <p> Globalization Checklist When combating globalization , one needs to know about each of its components . So here is a checklist of the things that an oligarch looks for in a nation before moving an American plant there : <p> 1 ) Free trade no tariffs on products exported back to USA . <p> 2 ) Free money investment capital can be sent there , and profits can come back here with no charges assessed . <p> 4 ) A devalued currency the nations currency is kept artificially cheap to ensure that sweatshop exports undercut the products of domestic producers in the USA . <p> 5 ) A currency peg after devaluation , the nation " pegs " its currency to the U.S. dollar . Its treasury department and central bank manipulate the currency to ensure that the exchange rate remains the same regardless of fluctuations in the value of the dollar . That locks in the advantage created by the devaluation in step #4 and demonstrates the nations commitment to keeping the Oligarchys sweatshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that globalization isnt " free trade " at all . In fact , it is a form of colonialism . American oligarchs partner with corrupt , tyrannical regimes around the world to exploit their " labor resources " ( people ) like so much oil , rubber , or bauxite . <h> Protectionism and Tariffs <p> Only a few years after full-blown " free trade " began with China , our economy lay in ruins , our banking system smashed , the federal government trillions of dollars in debt , and 50 million people living in poverty . Only a herculean effort by the Federal Reserve Bank revived the corpse , which is barely able to stagger on its own two feet to this day . <p> We have been betrayed and looted by the Oligarchy and their predatory mercantilist Third-World sweatshop partners . It is time that we begin to see ourselves for what we really are : a developing nation in need of protection from foreign imports . <p> It is not possible for us to recover while competing with imports from nations which maintain massively devalued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a simple fact of history that no nation ever rose to great-power status by embracing free trade . It is just the opposite : only protectionism can deliver rapid growth in a world infested with mercantilist sharks . <p> You might argue that protectionism worked okay for the first 150 years , or so , of our nations history , but the horse-and-buggy days are gone and protectionism does n't  work in the modern " hyper connected " world . But you would be wrong . In fact , we have just witnessed a spectacular protectionist success in South Korea . <p> For a long time , South Korea was one of the few places in the world where you could n't find a Toyota to save your life . Why not ? Because of their " Automobile Industry Protection Act " adopted in 1962 . The Oligarch Media preaches that such protectionism always results in shoddy products because domestic companies are shielded from the discipline of foreign competition . But South Korea put the lie to that propaganda . South Korea now has the 5th largest auto industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See the league tables here . Hyundai and Kia cars are now among the top brands in the USA , providing stiff competition to American and Japanese brands , and easily out-selling German brands . <p> We can do the same thing the Koreans just did , and we can do it in numerous industries , because we have lost numerous industries . <p> A flat , across-the-board tariff , as economist Ian Fletcher proposes , is probably best . However , an extra-high tariff may be required to bring textile industries back from low-wage nations . We need those jobs for the low-IQ segment of our population . Remember , when thinking about jobs , you must always ask yourself : " Where will the fans of professional wrestling work ? " <h> The American School of Economics <p> This manifesto is rooted in the historic American formula for economic success . The strategy that the USA used to surpass the British Empire was called the American School of Economics ( ASE ) . Set into motion by President Lincoln in 1861 , the ASE remained in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually harangued by Republicans to privatize the functions of government , such as the Post Office . We are told that the private sector can do anything better than our bumbling , incompetent , government bureaucrats . However , the Republican Party was founded with the exact opposite philosophy . <p> One of the first things that the first Republican president , Abraham Lincoln , did was to build the worlds first transcontinental railroad . The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 financed the construction with grants of federal land , and funds from 30-year government bonds . It was a spectacular success , and dramatically sped up the development of the western United States . <p> The ASE had seven pillars : <p> 1 ) Protective tariffs . <p> 2 ) Government-directed economic development . <p> 3 ) A national banking system . <p> 4 ) Government support of science . <p> 5 ) Government support of public schools . <p> 6 ) Rejection of Marxian class struggle . <p> 7 ) Government subsidy of business ( such as agriculture ) . <p> It could be argued that the restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the system . The ASE aimed for harmony between labor and capital , and it had become obvious that the overpopulated condition of the nation was a grave threat to that harmony . <p> Under the ASE , the national banking system did not fuel stock-market speculation . Lincoln issued his famous " greenbacks " to help pay for the Civil War , but the money was spent buying things from Main Street . Afterward , Congress adjusted the amount of greenbacks in circulation by buying more things from Main Street . Today , the Federal Reserve Bank also adjusts the money supply , however , it does so by purchasing treasury bonds from banks . This approach would work much better if modern banks werent also operating financial casinos , because when the Fed injects money into the system today , it can fuel speculation on Wall Street just as easily as the intended increase of credit to Main Street . <p> The USA abandoned the ASE in the early 1970s , and switched to David Rockefellers " Chicago School " of global free trade . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which wrecked the United Kingdom . Rockefeller did a year of post-graduate work at the London School of Economics in 1937 where his tutor was the free-market " Austrian School " economist Friedrich von Hayek . Rockefeller also studied under Joseph Schumpeter , another " Austrian " at Harvard , and got his PhD in economics from the University of Chicago , which his grandfather , John D. Rockefeller bankrolled . <p> The Chicago School , British School , Austrian School , Washington Consensus , neo-liberalism , and laissez-faire capitalism are all pretty much the same thing : rationalizations for oligarchs to loot . David Rockefeller is responsible for turning the patriotic Republican Party into the Party of the Oligarchy . <h> Tariffs did not Cause the Great Depression <p> As we mentioned in the Ross Perot vs . Al Gore section , international trade at the beginning of the Great Depression was a small percentage of GDP , and not by itself capable of destroying the economy . Rather , something much more profound than the Smoot-Hawley Tariff occurred in 1931 : the British went off of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds reserve currency up until 1944 when the dollar took over in the Bretton Woods system . So , British actions during the Great Depression were far more important than they are today . On September 21 , 1931 , the Bank of England went off the gold standard in what amounted to a deliberate currency devaluation . That triggered a chain of bank failures which intensified , and eventually culminated in President Roosevelts " Bank Holiday " in March 1933 . <p> However , the British action also smashed the international trading system . It became impossible to clear transactions just like the brief seize-up during the Financial Crisis of 2008 . Nations without resources in the 1930s , like Germany , Italy , and Japan could no longer buy what they needed on the international market , and had to make plans to acquire resources by a different method : conquest . <p> The USA remained on the gold standard , and saw exports plunge as a result since we were essentially demanding to be paid in gold when nobody had any . Many nations had held their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could therefore not purchase the gold or dollars needed to buy our exports . The USA did not go off of the gold standard until April 30 , 1933 almost two years later and the economy immediately bounced back . <p> During the Financial Crisis of 2008 , international trade ground to a halt all by itself without a single tariff being raised . In fact , that was the lowest-tariff period in American history ( see table here . ) Our experience in 2008 shows that the " London Gold Exit " is a more plausible explanation for the Great Depression than Smoot-Hawley . As a matter of fact , to hear the globalists tell it , you would think that a financial crisis would be impossible here in their free-trade paradise which it clearly was not . The smooth operation of international trade is almost completely dependent upon there being trust between the banks that issue the " letters of credit " which finance trade between nations . Compared to that , tariffs are a minor issue . <p> The collapse of international trade in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dethroned . Turning banks into casinos is literally a threat to world peace . <h> Dethroning the Bankers <p> In response to the Great Depression , a series of restrictions were placed on banking in order to prevent future crises . Those restrictions worked ; they were a great success for decades until they were removed . <h> Bring Back the Glass-Steagall Act <p> We must bring back the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 , which was officially revoked in 1999 . Glass-Steagall prevented banks and brokers from operating under the same roof . It prevented your bank from gambling with your savings clearly a good idea and created several decades of stable banking in the USA . Then the Financial Oligarchy bribed Congress to erode away Glass-Steagall . From PBS Frontline : <p> " In the 1997-98 election cycle , the finance , insurance , and real estate industries ( known as the FIRE sector ) , spends more than $200 million on lobbying and makes more than $150 million in political donations . Campaign contributions are targeted to members of Congressional banking committees and other committees with direct jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merge banks with brokers is so that they can have more deposits to gamble with . And as we found out in 2008 , they are not skilled gamblers . So , the institutions that hold your money , like banks and insurance companies must once again be strictly excluded from the gambling sector even if the casinos are called " investment banks . " We know what works , and what does not work with banking . We have historical precedent . It is not an issue open to question . Retail banking must be operated as a public utility . Not only is that a better way to organize the industry , but a more-boring organization will drive out the psychopaths who crave action for the sake of action ( see the psychopath sections below . ) <h> Revoke the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 <p> We must revoke the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 ( CFMA ) , which protected credit default swaps ( CDS ) from regulation . One of the nuclear blasts of the Financial Crisis of 2008 was caused by CDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion bailout was required to prevent a systemic meltdown . The CFMA prevented states from regulating CDS trading with gambling laws , because that 's exactly what it is : gambling . And it is totally outrageous that important financial institutions like banks and insurance companies are allowed to operate these CDS casinos . <h> A Financial Transaction Tax <p> We pay sales tax on nearly everything we buy , so why shouldnt the Oligarchy also pay a sales tax when they buy stocks , bonds , options , futures contracts , etc ? It was David Rockefeller and other bankers who sent our industrial firms to foreign lands . And one of the consequences of that globalization is that the stream of income taxes , and corporate taxes , flowing into the federal treasury is a lot less than it would have been otherwise . <p> Meanwhile , when the former middle-class funds return from nations like China , which have been enriched by the bankers globalization , those funds bloat up our financial sector . So , while the planks in this manifesto are being implemented , a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . The tax should not effect anyone trading less than , say , $1,000,000 per year , or whatever level that would be sufficient to exclude the middle class from the tax . <p> Proceeds would be spent to support and retrain the millions of unemployed victims of globalization , and to rebuild infrastructure in preparation for the return of the factories . <p> France was the first nation to adopt an ( FTT ) in August 2012 . However , it appears that the law will need to be modified because it excluded many derivative instruments such as ETFs . Ideally , all trading instruments would be traded on public exchanges and assessed the same sales tax just like Chinese sneakers in a Walmart . <h> Return Investment Banks to Partnerships <p> Prior to 1970 , the New York Stock Exchange prohibited member firms from incorporating . The Securities and Exchange Commission also forced investment banks to operate as partnerships instead of corporations . This convention was a result of the financial chaos of the Great Depression . Since the owners of a partnership are liable for company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would encourage more responsible behavior . If they were corporations , the owners would be shielded from liability , and could engage in more risky activities . <p> The SEC was right . The investment banks that triggered the Financial Crisis of 2008 were incorporated . For example , Bear Stearns was founded in 1923 , but incorporated in 1985 . The other two big investment banks that disappeared , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch , were also incorporated . Firms organized as partnerships fared much better in weathering the oligarchic chaos . 26 <p> The historical evidence is conclusive : investment banks must be organized as partnerships , or private companies , for their own good , the good of the nation , and the world . <h> The New York Stock Exchange <p> The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) used to be operated as a non-profit organization designed to facilitate orderly trading between member firms . In 2005 , the NYSE was converted into a for-profit corporation as part of the privatization craze . From the Financial Times : <p> " The SEC hoped these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most active stocks and commission rates have dropped , but there 's no free lunch . Due to a lack of economic incentives , traditional market makers , who used to act as shock absorbers in times of volatility , have exited the business , only to be replaced by automated market makers. " <p> Only five years after the privatization , public confidence in the NYSE was severely damaged by the Flash Crash of May 6 , 2010 . The tarnished reputation of the NYSE is a consequence of the maniacal application of laissez-faire ideology to everything that moves . And it harms the real economy by reducing investment money to new companies via initial public offerings ( IPO ) . The Facebook IPO was an excellent example of the " small people " getting burned by Wall Street . Such incidents inspire people to stuff their money into their mattresses rather than IPOs . <h> Smash the Dollar/Yuan Currency Peg <p> In Dark Art #7 , we discussed the damage being done to the USA by the dollar/yuan currency peg . So , what is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 19 , 2010 , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke urged the Chinese to play fair and let market forces determine the exchange rate . And that is exactly what an honest trading partner would do . But of course , China is no such thing , and will never voluntarily let its currency float to an equilibrium level set by the forces of supply and demand . <p> Expecting the Chinese to float the yuan is tantamount to expecting them to give up mercantilism ; to abandon the beating heart of their economic strategy ; to expect the parasite to voluntarily stop sucking the hosts blood . Not going to happen . <p> An across-the-board tariff will nullify a large chunk of the pegs effect . However , if the yuan is kept cheap enough , it might be necessary to put an additional tariff on Chinese imports . The amount would be whatever it takes to bring the prices of Chinese imports up to the level of domestic prices . So , if a Chinese tire , for example , is made with slave labor in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 0%-interest state loan , and sells for $50 thanks to the devalued currency , and the equivalent American-made tire sells for $80 , a 20% across-the-board tariff would only bring the Chinese tire up to $60 . So , an additional " China Special " tariff would be required . <p> This would be very , very unpopular with the multinationals that have moved so many plants to China . However , the American people would be overjoyed to get their jobs back as those factories came home . <p> If the Chinese cried " uncle " and let the yuan float in order to get the punitive tariff removed , factories would still return to the USA because much of the cost advantage would disappear as the yuan appreciated . However , the stronger yuan would make American products more affordable to the Chinese people . <p> The globalists constantly preach " free trade " except when it comes to currency trading . Then they demand that the dollar/yuan exchange-rate be set by dictatorial decree in Beijing . This fact puts the lie to the entire globalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather , it is about tilting the playing field in their direction , and only then allowing " free trade " to occur because they know the deck is stacked in their favor . <p> Bernankes " China Speech " was a revolutionary act because it directly challenged the keystone of the Oligarchys system . Fed stalkers who do n't  understand this are simply knuckleheads . Unfortunately , the Fed has no control over trade policy and has no power to put tariffs on the Chinese . That power is assigned to the Congress by the Constitution . <p> And guess what ? Beijing has a man in the Congress defending their interests . When commenting on a 2011 Senate bill to retaliate against Chinas currency manipulation , Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner said : <p> " I think its pretty dangerous to be moving legislation through the United States Congress forcing someone to deal with the value of their currency . This is well beyond , I think , what the Congress ought to be doing . " <p> Hard to believe . Exchange rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged by the Constitution to regulate trade . So , Boehners statement violates his oath of office where he swore to : " defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic " <p> We had the same type of currency exchange-rate problem with Japan in the 1980s . Back then , during the Ronald Reagan administration , we put the smack down on the Japanese and forced-up the value of the yen dramatically with the Plaza Accord of 1985 . We should have done the same thing with the Chinese long ago . But things are different this time around . <p> Back in the 1980s , American manufactures campaigned for the Plaza Accord . They fought hard to level the playing field with the Japanese . Not so today . Rather , its just the opposite . American-based multinationals send out flunkies like John Boehner to fight on behalf of Beijing because their factories are in China now . <p> And so what Boehner said is exactly right when we realize that the USA is no longer a sovereign nation . Boehners statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the interests of Beijing come before the interests of the hapless American people . <p> A central tenet of Oligarchic rule is that the " local yokels " of the worlds nations especially us American yokels do n't  have any say in trade or immigration policy . Borders shall be wide open to the convenience of multinationals . Whether they are exporting factories or importing cheap labor , plebs who imagine that they are still citizens of sovereign nations need to mind their beeswax . If Americans want to shake off their plebeian status , regain citizenship , and get their jobs back , they will have to sweep traitors like Boehner from office . <h> What Will Become of Foreign Sweatshop Workers ? <p> First , we must recognize that the USA can not solve the problems of the entire world certainly not now , and maybe not ever . While our economy is very large , it is not infinite , and the idea that we can employ the whole world is comical . At the time of this writing in 2012 , the USA had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the world was 7 billion . When charting these numbers , we see that our job market is barely even visible ( click to enlarge ) : <p> Similarly , bringing the factories home will only create a tiny blip in the grand scheme of things , because we just do n't  employ a significant percentage of the worlds population even counting all of our offshore sweatshops . <p> What would happen if we revoked NAFTA , and the Oligarchy had to bring their factories back to the USA ? Mexico might respond by raising tariffs on U.S. food imports . American farmers would be hurt , but farming is not a labor-intensive industry and any jobs lost there would be dwarfed by the factory jobs repatriated . Sweatshop workers in Mexico would lose their jobs , but the consequential increase in food prices would make it feasible for them to return to their farms . American food imports wiped out 1.4 million Mexican campesinos ( peasant farmers ) , many of which turned to growing drug crops . <p> Mexico was forced into NAFTA by U.S. bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prior to its subjugation , Mexico was doing quite well with a protectionist development strategy that produced The Mexican Miracle . <p> Are sweatshop jobs better than farm jobs ? Some people think so , however it depends on what price the farmer can get for his crops now does n't  it ? Sweatshop workers can never grow wealthy , but a farmer at least has a chance to prosper . A sweatshop is purposely designed to squeeze every bit of life out of workers at the lowest possible cost . <p> Even so , that is beside the point . The fact is that the USA is in the predicament that it is in because we have allowed the Oligarchy to re-arrange entire nations to suit their greed . Is it written in stone that the Oligarchs version of Mexico is better than the previous , authentic version of Mexico ? If an auto plant is transferred from Detroit to Guadalajara , has anything been truly accomplished for the USA or Mexico as a whole ? <p> No , it has not . If the Americans rebel against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mexico falls back to square-one , and Detroit rises back up to square-one . However , the profit squeezed out of the workers by the oligarchs remains , safe and sound , in the Cayman Islands . <p> Yes , nations like China , Mexico , and India will have to fend for themselves once they are cut off from the firehose spraying American jobs into their countries . But that 's inevitable anyway . They will eventually have to figure out how to build their own middle classes . Perhaps they will learn how by watching how we depose our oligarchy . <h> End the Empire Before it Collapses <p> The number of industries available for exportation to allied nations in return for loyalty and military bases is obviously a finite number . Additionally , the number of industries that we can export is limited by the resulting mass unemployment and poverty in the homeland . Federal dollars spent on unemployment compensation and food stamps can not be used to build aircraft carriers . And so , we have come to the limit of this age of oligarchic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers from starving now restrict further imperial expansion . <p> After World War II , our economy was so huge that we were not fatally wounded by , for example , sending the television-building industry to Japan . However , after seven decades of such policy , combined with the Financial Oligarchys free-trade looting spree of the past two decades , we are clearly courting disaster . The credit rating of the federal government was reduced from AAA to AA+ in 2011 an historic event not overlooked by the other nations of the world . <p> In addition to financial constraints , mass unemployment and poverty create political pressure and constraints . The Occupy Wall Street protests of 2011 accomplished nothing , but they did prove the existence of a large number of people willing to rebel for no reason at all . The bizarre " revolution about nothing " provided only a vague condemnation of the Financial Oligarchy . One wonders what such numbers combined with competent leadership could have accomplished . OWS could have taken its place next to the victories of the Bonus Army , the sit-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960s . <p> In any case , we can no longer afford the imperial luxury of running massive trade deficits , which are partly the result of State Department policy made on behalf of the Pentagon . <p> We have created a mighty , globe-spanning empire . We are the only nation in history to control all the oceans of the world . Imperialists can take satisfaction in that . However , it was not done without a price a heavy price and now we are visibly staggering under the burden of that price . <p> Having reached the limits of geopolitical trade , what comes next ? There is really only one option : economic nationalism . The reason that this is the case is because the rest of the world has been practicing economic nationalism all along . We have preached " fair trade " and a " level playing field " for decades , and not a single nation has been swayed not even our best political allies . <p> Our trade deficits with Germany and Japan are not an accident , or the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are literally payment for political loyalty . Payment for their membership in the " Free World " and the global struggle with Communism . However , both Germany and Japan , along with the rest of the world , have never ceased mercantilist practices . <p> In fact , the European Union was founded as a " customs union " in the 1950s with the explicit intent of keeping out U.S. products and forcing American companies to move plants over there in order to continue doing business . The Japanese are legendary in their systematic targeting of American industries , a successful practice noticed and adopted by the Chinese . <p> Our preaching of the free-trade gospel to the world has fallen on deaf ears . Nothing but mercantilist sharks swim the seas of this dog-eat-dog globe . Once we abandon our quixotic approach to world trade , and adopt economic nationalism like every other nation on Earth , we will feel a lot better . We will command more respect because nations will no longer perceive us an economic punching bag , but also because they will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , in order to retain super-power status , we need to throw off oligarchic rule before all of our wealth is transferred to the Cayman Islands ; before our free-spending middle class is completely liquidated . <p> Even though the USA continues to permit large trade deficits , our allies and trading partners see the writing on the wall and are eager to jump ship : <p> In 2009 , the " BRIC " nations , Brazil , Russia , India , and China began talking about their desire to replace the dollar as the worlds reserve currency . <p> In 2010 , the Australian navy conducted its first-ever military exercises with the Chinese navy . That was a significant event because while the Financial Oligarchy is China-friendly , the Military Oligarchy is not , and Australia has been one of the USAs closest allies . Australia exports a lot of natural resources to feed Chinas giant manufacturing machine , so it is becoming more logical for them to switch loyalties . <p> In May 2012 , China , Japan , and South Korea agreed to begin discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stationed in Japan and South Korea at the time , and yet they were planning to switch loyalty to China . <p> In August 2012 , the Chinese navy paid its first-ever visit to Israel . The Israelis have been long-time allies , however perhaps they are thinking they need a richer patron now that the Pentagon-backed dictatorship in next-door Egypt has been overthrown . <p> China is now rivaling the USA for influence in Africa . African nations prefer to do business with the Chinese because the barbaric Chinese do n't  lecture the Africans on human rights as the USA and other Western nations do . So , this is another consequence of our transferring so much economic power to China : a regression in human rights around the world . <p> What will happen once we are completely hollowed out ? Without favors to dispense , and without a prosperous middle class able to purchase imports , we will begin to lose allies , and our empire will collapse . This process has already begun . Clearly , a strategic , orderly retreat is a preferable policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hardly be the end of the world . While our trading partners will squawk at the loss of their lucrative trade surpluses , they will acknowledge that we had no choice ; that it was inevitable . On the military side , they may not be so quick to switch loyalties . During a September 2012 dispute over the Senkaku Islands , Chinese mobs protested Japan , attacking Japanese auto dealerships and Chinese citizens who owned Japanese cars . Being pals with the Chinese might not be so easy for Japan , and the Chinese are very unlikely to permit new-found allies to run trade surpluses against them as the USA has done since World War II . <p> Our global military empire is intimately enmeshed with globalization . We ended the successful protectionist era of our history when the Cold War began in order to win nations over to our side of the conflict . Here in the era of " geopolitical trade " we recruit nations into alliance by permitting them to export their products to our market , and by allowing their people to enter our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshops on Saipan . The Pentagon wanted land , and the islanders used that desire as leverage to get legal exemptions that permitted the establishment of sweatshops . <p> Of course , ideally , the Pentagon would be primarily occupied with actually defending the USA . During the summer of 2012 , when U.S. forces were still trying to make Afghanistan safe for multinationals , a Russian Akula-2 attack submarine armed with long-range cruise missiles prowled undetected for several weeks in U.S. strategic waters in the Gulf of Mexico . <p> We spend around a $1 trillion on defense , security , intelligence , and wars and we could n't detect an actual invasion of our turf ? Unbelievable . But it makes sense . The truth is that preoccupation with empire is itself a threat to national security because it neglects actual defense of the homeland . <p> Now , you might think that we can freeze things where they are now , and then rebuild the homeland from here . We successfully built up Germany , Japan , and China to contain Russia . Mission accomplished , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding " free trade " with nations like South Korea and Vietnam . Ten years from now , will we be sending factories to Laos and Cambodia to contain Vietnam ? <p> This endless cycle of " geopolitical trade " is really just a smokescreen for continued expansion of the Oligarchy at the expense of the homeland . <h> Outlaw Outsourcing <p> We must restrict , reform , or simply outlaw outsourcing as Cambridge , Massachusetts has done . The practice clearly has criminal intent to violate labor laws . <h> End Privatization <p> The Oligarchys intent is to strip every middle-class American of their job . This is pretty easily done in the private sector . Sending factories to China , for example , is a government-sanctioned business model . The Americans with jobs that ca n't be sent to low-wage nations , housekeepers at hotels for example , are replaced by immigrants willing to work for rock-bottom wages . <p> But what about government workers ? Would Americans stand for the Post Office , for example , firing its citizen workers and replacing them with Mexicans brought in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " privatize " the Post Office , then the Oligarchs can go to work eradicating all of those jobs held by lazy , greedy , unionized American citizens . <p> Clearly , there are numerous privatization success stories . But there are also numerous horror stories . At a minimum , we should have a moratorium on privatization , reverse the privatization of the prison system , and have an outright ban on all new privatization projects where reducing labor costs is the only rationale . <h> Kick Small States Out of the U.S. Senate <p> Californias 37.7 million people have two seats in the U.S. Senate the exact same number as Wyomings 568,000 people . Because of this crazy arrangement , small agricultural states wield incredible power relative to the larger industrial states . So , when Big Agricultures lobbyists are campaigning for something , they come armed with , not only money , but an entire squad of Senators something that no other lobby can do . <p> As a consequence of this concentration of power , the USA is being converted into an agricultural nation . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ag helped bring China into the World Trade Organization to increase food exports . What does Iowa care if Ohio is de-industrialized by these trade agreements as long as corn exports are brisk ? <p> Big Ag also supports mass-immigration to keep the flow of cheap labor coming to harvest their crops . During the immigration debate in 2013 , Big Ag opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants , but supported a " path " to citizenship for farm workers . In other words , they wanted their cheap labor to stay , but not acquire any civil rights just yet . They also campaigned for Congress to expand the H-2A visa program . <p> Big Ag is notorious for inflicting horrendous working conditions on its migrant workers . For example , some workers report that they werent even given gloves to harvest the extremely toxic tobacco plant . Green Tobacco Sickness can be contracted by absorbing too much nicotine through your skin . Concentrated nicotine was once used by assassins to coat the tips of their daggers . All they had to do was scratch you , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it relaxes the muscles that work your lungs so much that you stop breathing . When it is time to spray insecticide on the crops , growers go right ahead whether or not there are workers in the fields . Illegal immigrants are afraid to complain to authorities , so why not ? <p> Prior to the Revolutionary War , British policy was to keep their American colonies as suppliers of raw materials such as cotton . The British did not want an industrial revolution in America . They wanted the cotton shipped to Britain , where they would make it into clothing , and then ship it back to America . It was a geopolitical policy designed to keep America weak and subservient . Today , we are reverting back to that model , complete with slave-like working conditions in the fields . <h> Reduce Corporate Power Over Society <p> Right-wing Republicans and Libertarians assert that no restrictions or taxation should be placed on corporations . However , corporations do not exist in the wild ; they are creatures of the state artificial entities that the People bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free benefit : they are exempted from being liable for any misdeeds of their corporations . In a truly laissez-faire economy , the owners of businesses would be liable for everything they do via their business entities . Ironically , by operating through limited-liability organizations like corporations , investors are rejecting laissez-faire ! They are hiding behind the skirts of the People ! <p> The People grant limited liability to investors with the expectation of increased investment that will benefit the People . Morally , the People can design corporate structure to be anything they wish . Obviously , the question of what corporations can and can not do is a completely legitimate one . And as we saw previously in the " Return Investment Banks to Partnerships " section , the People take a large risk when they grant the limited-liability privilege . Sometimes they literally create a monster like AIG , Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , or Enron . <h> The Role of Ideology <p> The United States has a long history of Jeffersonian ideology which champions the little guy : small farms , small business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponents of this ideology to understand that Thomas Jefferson himself abandoned it when he became president in 1801 . In his First Inaugural Address , Jefferson said : " We are all Republicans , we are all Federalists . " <p> Alexander Hamiltons federalism was simply more practical . The problem with rigid ideologies is that they can only work under static conditions where nothing is changing . However , change was rapid during Jeffersons time . Imagine if the USA had adopted a Jeffersonian economic system that prevented the development of large enterprises . What would have happened to the new railroad technology that was being developed at the end of Jeffersons life ? How well would it have worked if the first transcontinental railroad had to be patched together from thousands of small Mom &amp; Pop railroads ? Not very well at all <p> The new technology of the railroad could not be shoehorned into Jeffersonian ideology . The concept of competition did n't  work very well either . Railroads are expensive to build . Suppose you need ten years to make back your investment on a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a year of operation , a competitor sees how well you are doing and builds a competing railroad . If you then compete on price , your profits may drop below the level needed to make your loan payments . You will both go bankrupt . If you collude on pricing , you might both be able to eke out a profit , but you are breaking the law and might be prosecuted by the Justice Department . In this scenario , there is no way for you to succeed no matter how hard you work , or how intelligently you run your business . <p> A more modern example is Howard Sterns 1994 New Years Eve television special . The show was aired on cable TV and was a success , but Stern never did another one . He spent many hours ranting about the large share of profits that the Mom &amp; Pop cable companies around the country were demanding . Each had a monopoly granted by their local governments , and consequently acted like miniature oligarchs . Stern was never able to agree to terms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best . When a technology does not lend itself to free enterprise , the people need to regulate it via their government . This is how we keep the natural monopoly of electricity generation from overcharging us . Corporations operate the utilities , but the prices they are permitted to charge are regulated by the people . The system works well with investors getting dividends and citizens getting affordable electricity . Utilities have an incentive to restore service after a storm because they ca n't bill customers for electricity that is not delivered . <p> Imagine if Ronald Reagan had campaigned on extending free-market ideology to electric utility companies . Imagine if he had thundered : " We must get government off the backs of utility companies ! They must have the freedom to charge whatever price they wish for their service ! We must put an end to the central planning of power generation ! " Do you think he would have been elected president twice ? Not hardly . Of course , Reagan did no such thing . Nobody is that stupid . <p> Nevertheless , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electricity industry was deregulated . Only four years later , Enron was taking power plants off-line during peak hours just so they could charge higher prices on the artificially lowered supply of electricity . It was quite the spectacle : one of the worlds most technologically advanced areas suffering blackouts at the whim of private-sector electricity traders . The rest of the world probably thought that we were a bunch of yokels generating our power with hamster wheels . <h> Power-Reduction Principle #1 Small-Scale Production <p> Whatever can be efficiently done on a small scale should be done on a small scale . A coffee shop , for example , can be efficiently operated as a small business . There is no economic necessity to have them all controlled by a giant corporation like Starbucks . Perhaps a large company could achieve economies of scale by purchasing their own coffee plantations , distributors , etc . However , what people making that argument neglect to consider is that large corporations also achieve legal- and political economies of scale . They use their large staff of lawyers to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass laws that harm workers , etc . <p> If an enterprise can be efficiently operated on a small scale , large corporations should be prevented from " rolling up " all the little guys . Like Aristotle taught , its better to have ten middle-class , small business owners in your town than it is to have one coffee baron who employees the other nine at minimum wage . The middle-class organization of society is more economically robust , and politically harmonious . <h> Power-Reduction Principle #2 Precedent <p> Why re-invent the wheel ? Ask : How has this activity been done in the past ? How is it done in other areas ? How well have those other approaches worked out ? Could that approach work here ? For example , when studying what might be done about Walmart , we would look at how the Japanese have protected their small retailers from large stores . <h> Power-Reduction Principle #3 Necessity <p> Example : do we need to designate corporations as people ? The world has 7 billion people already ; does it really need more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new people via sex or test tubes ? <h> Power-Reduction Principle #4 Utility <p> American cities have regulated water , sewer , and power systems . When was the last time that you saw a sewer district agitating in Congress for more immigration ? When was the last time you saw a power company agitating to bring in cheap Mexican electricity ? These utilities do not conspire to undermine American sovereignty because they have little incentive to do so , and their limited profitability does not attract the oligarch-type of capitalist . Since these systems work well for the people , we might look at turning other industries into utilities . <p> Banking is an excellent place to start because we have a tremendous success story in our history when banks were regulated as virtual utilities during the three decades between 1940-1970 . And many cities have already turned internet-access into a utility with municipal Wi-Fi systems . Wireless Internet technology is still advancing , but it has reached a " good enough " stage that it can be operated by the people through their local governments . Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long enough . <h> We Must Prepare for the Robots <p> What will happen when advanced robots can do every job better than humans ? Will we all be out of work while one super-oligarch acquires all the worlds wealth ? Obviously , that 's a pretty dumb plan . What we should do is operate robotic production facilities as utilities so that things like socks , toothpicks , and frying pans flow to citizens just like electricity and water . This step might be skipped if " 3D printing " machines can be deployed in households , but service jobs will remain an issue . <h> Swinging Back the Corporate Pendulum <p> After the collapse of the Soviet Union , it was obvious that corporations worked better than communes . But then we got crazy , literally worshipping corporate power , and it was n't long before our hubristic oligarchs and their corporations crashed the global economy in 2008 . <p> Now it is time to swing the pendulum back to the center ; to a place where oligarchs are reigned in and unnecessary corporate power is scrubbed from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed with a corporate form . Before the Civil War , tyranny could be found in the form of family-owned slave plantations . Today , tyranny can be found in the form of corporate production outsourced to sweatshop subcontractors . <h> Overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court Decision <p> The 2010 " Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission " Supreme Court decision ruled that the First Amendment of the Constitution applies to corporations , unions , and other organizations such that the federal government can not limit their political speech , meaning campaign contributions . In effect , it allows large organizations to dilute the authentic political voice of the people . <p> Corporations are quite obviously not people . The Supreme Court has given human political rights to corporations for the purpose of increasing their political power . That is a clearly fascist act . If , for example , the people of Florida wanted to establish a fascist system , they would have amended Chapter 607 , the Florida Business Corporation Act , to explicitly give corporations such power . But of course , they have not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globalization <p> " In our glorious fight for civil rights , we must guard against being fooled by false slogans , such as right to work. Wherever these laws have been passed , wages are lower , job opportunities are fewer and there are no civil rights . We demand this fraud be stopped . " <p> -Martin Luther King , 1961 <p> International globalization creates a " race to the bottom " where countries compete with each other to attract sweatshops by offering the lowest wages , the most brutal working conditions , and the most lax environmental laws . <p> Within the USA , we have a phenomena that might be called " internal globalization " where state and local governments engage in the same sort of competition . As we discussed previously , governments compete for large businesses by offering tax incentives , infrastructure , favorable zoning , etc . This gives way too much negotiating power to corporations and should be eliminated by federal regulation . The spectacle of corporations pocketing withholding taxes from worker paychecks is an outrage against Democracy . <p> The Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ploy to break unions . The exodus of factories from the unionized northern states to the " Right to Work " southern states has been one of the big drivers of income inequality . These laws should be abolished by federal regulation . <p> Now , Jeffersonians will decry this restriction of states rights . However , the result will be to increase the bargaining power of local governments versus the often much-larger companies that reside in their states . So , when a company demands a cut in its taxes , the local government can reply : " Sorry , our hands are tied ; new federal regulations , you know . " <p> In 1950 , the Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers signed an agreement called " The Treaty of Detroit . " The agreement was a great success and was adopted by many other industries . Once the battle between union states and right-to-work states is eliminated , we might be able to design a national " Treaty of America " to bring stability to labor relations . Our current plan , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to produce harmony and tranquility in the future . Its far more likely to cause strife and rebellion . <p> Another form of internal globalization is state incorporation of companies . For example , Citibank is notorious for moving its credit-card operations to South Dakota in 1981 after that state raised the maximum allowable interest charge to 25% . Delaware is an on-shore tax haven which helps corporations dodge the income taxes of their home states with Delaware-incorporated shell companies . This is an area that cries out for national standardization . <h> Limit CEO Compensation <p> Todays exorbitantly compensated corporate CEOs are the stuff of legend . Of course , many of them are paid with the spoils that are clawed away from the people via the global law of the jungle . <p> One possible remedy is to adjust the CEOs income-tax bracket based upon the ratio of her compensation to that of her employees . If she makes 200 times more than her average worker , then her tax will be in the highest bracket . If she makes 100x , then she will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage a narrower ratio and it should include the pay of workers at subcontractors all of them even the ones in Bangladesh . <p> Another remedy might be done at the incorporation level . Instead of having a corporations profits divided up between only shareholders , a certain percentage could be devoted to mandatory profit sharing . As we discussed previously , the People can incorporate companies any way they wish . This might be done nationwide with federally incorporated companies that are incentivized with a lower tax rate , or by eliminating state incorporation . Profit-sharing is a powerful way to build harmony between labor and management . <h> Curtail Covert Corporate Propaganda <p> We urgently need to find ways to curtail corporate propaganda . A good way to do this would be to require that all political information published by a corporation have the corporation clearly identified as the author . For example , this requirement would prohibit oligarchs like the Koch Brothers from paying a pet professor at a pet university to publish a paper titled : " The Virtue of Laissez Faire Economics " under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Koch Industries , Inc . Or better yet , corporations would be prohibited from funding " independent " think tanks , universities , or foundations altogether . If they wanted to hire intellectuals directly , and publish their work directly with their corporate logo stamped on the cover , that would be fine . They might also be restricted to publishing electronically only on their official website . <p> Television and radio networks should be required to disclose any news-like programs that are provided to them by outside entities , such as public-relations firms . <p> Whatever restrictions are imposed , the goal would be to clearly identify published information as coming from the corporation itself . A business enterprise should be able to make its own case , putting forth ideas on how its industry could be improved . But putting forth an agenda via front organizations designed to hide the participation of the corporation is clearly a nefarious activity and must be prohibited . <p> Non-media corporations should be restricted from owning media . For example , GE should not be allowed to own television stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that it has out-competed smaller competitors because it is more efficient . But more efficient at what ? After all , the Nazis were famous for making the trains run on time , but we do n't  laud the Nazis . The truth is that Walmart has brought the southern slave mentality into modern business . They have indeed been more efficient at beating down wages . They have also been eager to order suppliers to move their factories to China to beat wages down even more . Do we really want to go back to a pre-industrial slave society ? Because that 's were Walmart is taking us . <p> Walmart and the Walton Family have grown so huge , rich , and powerful that they are now essentially dictating U.S. industrial and labor policy . And that is not acceptable . If the people wanted to return to a pre-industrial slave society like the one that existed in Bentonville , Arkansas before 1865 , they would have elected representatives to re-establish the Confederacy . <p> The measures discussed elsewhere in this book would go a long way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we should also have some sort of overall size limit that would function as an emergency " fire break " mechanism for controlling corporate fascism . Something analogous to the federal governments " debt ceiling . " <p> In general , the mechanism would work by setting limits on the number of locations , employees , revenues , etc . Whatever is appropriate for the industry . Then , if a company hits that limit , it must cease expanding until the official limit can be raised . This mechanism allows the people to have a say . For example , suppose that twenty years from now an airline wants to establish service to the Moon . They would need to raise a lot of capital to buy expensive rockets and spaceships , and the limit on airline size would likely need to be raised . If put to a vote , a few environmentalists might campaign against it , but most people would probably support it . <p> People might also approve Walmarts expansion into union strongholds , but at least there would be a debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also have a benefit to the overall health of the nation . If Republican politicians can threaten to shut down the government once a year over the debt ceiling , why cant Democrats do the same to Walmart ? What 's good for the goose <p> Oligarchs will argue that we need to create giant corporations to compete with those of other nations . However , the issue here is not economies of scale . It is the question of how much political power a corporation may wield . This is also not an issue of the Jeffersonian sentiment that " small business " is better than " big business . " The goal here is to evolve corporations that do no harm . Size is not an issue until the corporation begins to throw its weight around in the political arena , and until we can figure out how to prevent that , we need to limit size . <p> Walmart is every bit as destructive to America as was Enron , and Walmart should be prosecuted and dismantled just like Enron . Money should even be clawed-back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anything that will stick , like the bribery of Mexican officials that was uncovered in 2012 . Remember , oligarchs consider themselves to be above the law , so if prosecutors look closely , they will find numerous instances of wrongdoing in almost any multinational . Enron is not the exception ; it is the rule . <p> Antitrust law needs to become more ambitious . Preventing a monopoly from overcharging consumers is nice , but it is small potatoes compared to what Walmart does . Walmart degrades the very nation itself : crushing small businesses , forcing suppliers to offshore , and underpaying millions of workers . Walmart may not charge monopoly prices for food , but is there a moral difference when they pay workers so badly that they cant afford to buy food ? Walmart , and other slave-wage companies have thousands of workers who still qualify for food stamps ( see GoodJobsFirst.org ) . <p> One way or another , Walmart and the Walton Family must be punished and stripped of their political power . Perhaps a special tax is in order . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , or a " job exportation tax . " We should make an example of Walmart to create a milestone in U.S. history . A grand turning point that will loom large in history books forever . A watershed where America turned away from the fascist/slave-production model , and back toward the middle-class model . <p> The alternative is to be dissolved into the international muck ; the working conditions that multinationals like Walmart have created overseas : tyrannical regimes , sweatshops , pollution all the rotten fruits of oligarchy . That is their vision for America , and it is a vision that must be smashed unequivocally . <h> Screen Psychopaths <p> " Corporations are people , my friend . " -Mitt Romney <p> If we play along with Mitt Romneys assertion , we might wonder : what are the chances of corporations being psychopaths , just like some people are ? Which companies are the corporate version of Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot , Idi Amin , Jack the Ripper , and Ted Bundy ? This may seem like a frivolous topic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , however a psychopath in control of a large organization such as a government , military unit , or corporation can do an enormous amount of damage to his fellow humans . <p> Think of a psychopath as a predator ; like a coyote , wolf , or hyena . They may kill and eat a human baby , and not feel any remorse . He was hungry , so he captured some prey and ate it . It seems completely reasonable and natural to him . But , you would n't want such a creature operating a day-care business . Or an electricity grid . The Enron employees who were put in charge of Californias electricity grid laughed it up as people suffered without power ( see this CBS story ) . And " callous/lack of empathy " is one of the traits on the PCL-R psychopathology test . <p> Human predators are far more dangerous than animals , not only because they are smarter , but because they are much more difficult to identify . They blend right in because they look just like us . The proverbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We Americans do n't  like to put restrictions on innocent people . However , we do restrict disabled people from holding certain types of jobs . For example , blind people are not allowed to fly airplanes . Of course , with autopilot technology , a blind pilot might be able to get along just fine these days . Nevertheless , we should probably put restrictions on psychopaths because their behavior is the result of a physical disability : abnormal brain structure . <p> Psychiatrist/scholar Iain McGilchrist , wrote in his book , " The Master and His Emissary " ( page 113 ) : <p> " Psychopaths , who have no sense of guilt , shame or responsibility , have deficits in the right frontal lobe " <p> In 2011 , The Journal of Business Ethics published a paper by Clive R. Boddy titled : " The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis . " Here is a quote : <p> " In these senior corporate positions , the Corporate Psychopaths single-minded pursuit of their own self-enrichment and self aggrandizement to the exclusion of all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of noblesse oblige , equality , fairness , or of any real notion of corporate social responsibility . " <p> " Anyone who makes decisions that affect significant numbers of other people , concerning issues of corporate social responsibility or toxic waste , for example , or concerning mass financial markets or mass employment , should be screened to make sure that they are , at the very least , not psychopaths and at most are actually people who care about others . " <p> How could psychopaths be screened if they look just like normal people ? Well , there is a test called the PCL-R which might be required of executives before they can assume leadership of commercial , government , and military organizations above a certain size . The PCL-R might also be made part of commercial surety bonding . <h> Was George W. Bush a Psychopath ? <p> How else would you explain these two videos showing Bush using other peoples clothes as washcloths ? At 11 seconds into this video , you can see Bush shake hands with a Haitian man , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this video you can see Bush wiping his eyeglasses on the clothes of a David Letterman staff member . Bush also bears an uncanny resemblance to psychopath serial-killer , Ted Bundy . <h> Pseudo Psychopaths <p> Oligarchs like the Koch Brothers propagate libertarian ideology that praises greed and selfishness as positive traits . This type of propaganda creates what might be called " pseudo psychopaths " people who begin to act like natural psychopaths because everybody else is doing it . <p> After Walter Isaacson published his biography of Steve Jobs in 2011 , a plague of managers acting like psychopaths spread across the nation . Designer Ben Bleikamp wrote a post on his blog titled " The Steve Jobs Complex " where he complained about the obnoxious managers who he had to work for . Bleikamp has since removed the " sacrilege " from his website , but he was mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article from April 2 , 2012 titled : " Bio as Bible : Managers Imitate Steve Jobs . " <p> In 2011 , psychologist Paul Piff published a paper titled " Higher Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Academy of Sciences . Piff reported : <p> " While having money does n't  necessarily make anybody anything , the rich are way more likely to prioritize their own self-interests above the interests of other people . It makes them more likely to exhibit characteristics that we would stereotypically associate with , say , assholes . " <p> This is another reason for limiting CEO pay : excess pay fosters harmful behavior . <p> However , psychopaths are an even larger problem than the scientists suspect . Psychopaths do n't  always just take the money and run ; sometimes they build systems like slave plantations and concentration camps . Removing the psychopaths in charge of such systems may not have much benefit if the systems are allowed to continue operating under new management . In fact , the global economic system itself looks as if it was designed to nurture psychopath leaders . <h> Dismantle the Psychopath-Designed Globalist System <p> Defenders of globalization say that the system of international trade was designed for the benefit of the globe as a whole , even if the American middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Forbes : <p> " So I would actually posit that whether the American , or European , or rich world , middle class benefits from globalization is actually an incomplete question . Incomplete enough to be the wrong question . Almost to the point that the answer is " who cares ? " <p> However , as we discussed earlier , modern globalization was invented by bankers to bail themselves out of bad loans to Latin America . So , even if the world as a whole does benefit , it is only by accident , and the effects are likely to be short-lived . After all , once all of the factories are sucked out of America , what will nations like China , Mexico , and India do next ? <h> Globalization The Modern Art of Economics <p> How the music sounds is not the point . " -Arnold Schoenberg <p> Let 's look at the atomic level of globalization . What actually happens ? Answer : a modern , high-tech , safe , clean , efficient , profitable factory providing middle-class jobs for American citizens is moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-tech , dangerous , pollution-spewing sweatshop burning through hapless peasants as fast as it can wear out their bodies . Income is redistributed from the formerly profitable , tax-paying American workers to the tax-dodging traitorous oligarchs . <p> Is there anything about that process that can be called progress ? Of course not . Globalization is , in fact , a regressive process a de-evolution away from Americas middle-class utopia and back toward an archaic slave dystopia . <p> Globalization is the economic equivalent of some horrible work of modern art : it is not designed to uplift you ; it is designed to erode your mortal soul . <h> The Rock-a-Box <p> When you study the entire globalized system of production and distribution from a high level , it becomes obvious that it is a system " of the psychopaths , by the psychopaths , and for the psychopaths . " It is designed to grind humans into dust a profitable dust . Like slave plantations where slaves were worked to death as fast as possible when replacements were readily available at economical prices , the modern sweatshop system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave plantations , sweatshops , maquiladoras , cults , prison factories , concentration camps these are all systems of a variety that might be called the " Rock-a-Box " named in honor of David Rockefeller , the Father of Globalization and Neo-Liberalism . A Rock-a-Box is any system of production designed to squeeze as much profit as possible out of human labor without regard to consequences . If the used-up " labor inputs " have to be buried in a mass grave out back , then so be it . At least that way you do n't  have to contribute to their unemployment compensation . <p> American gadgets are made in Chinese sweatshops operated by companies like Foxconn that have horrendous turn-over rates . There are plenty of people in China , so workers can be pushed as hard as possible . It does n't  matter how quickly they quit because there are plenty more where they came from . That 's why the sweatshops are in China and not Iceland . <p> When the gadgets arrive in the USA , they move through a warehouse system that drives workers just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn out workers as fast as possible before they qualify for pay-raises and vacation time . You do not " work your way up " in these sweat-warehouses . <p> The gadgets are then sold in retail stores like Walmart operated by workers making the lowest possible legal wage . And , of course , Walmart has an horrendous turn-over rate , made possible by the USAs program of mass immigration . <p> All three of these institutions : factory , warehouse &amp; retail store are Rock-a-Boxes , and the system as a whole is one giant , globe-spanning Rock-a-Box . <p> The psychopaths who designed this system are , no doubt , very pleased with how efficiently the little plebs move through it , and how thoroughly it milks them of their labor . However , they likely dream of even further efficiencies : lower pay , or no pay at all , more sadistic practices sanctioned for overseers , attack dogs approved for use on the factory floor , etc . An oligarch can dream , can he not ? <h> The Psychopathic Psychology of Laissez-Faire Ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds that market forces should set the prices of goods and wages . So , since the world has a surplus of labor , wages should drop until the excess supply is worked off even if it means that workers are not paid enough to buy food . This , of course , is why there is no such thing as a pure laissez-faire society : it is a system that only a psychopath could love . <p> " For highly un-empathic individuals , such as psychopaths , in whom this part of the brain is defective , and therefore for whom this aspect of the world is missing , they will devote themselves , like philosophers , to calculation . " <p> This is why psychopaths are drawn to laissez-faire economics : because it deliberately excludes the human element which the psychopath can not fathom . The " invisible hand " programs the actions of the humans , and everything automatically works out for the best . Of course , laissez-faire economics also conveniently disarms the sheep , and gives the psychopathic wolves license to prey upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda dissuades them from forming unions . <p> A laissez-faire economy is like an ant farm to a psychopath . All that he has to do is put the ants in , and they will take it from there . If any ants die , you just put fresh ones in . The ants are like little worker robots . It does n't  matter if they live or die , they are just things , no more significant than paper clips or rubber bands . <p> The bible of the Oligarchy is the novel " Atlas Shrugged " by Ayn Rand which sings the praises of laissez-faire capitalism . Literary critics have taken Rand to task for her stiff , cardboard-like characters . However , that was the best Rand could do . Like McGilchrist said in the quote above , " Atlas Shrugged " is all about philosophical " calculation " because that 's all that Ayn Rand was capable of because she was a psychopath . Not able to fathom humans , she was unable to create convincingly human characters . All of the interaction between her characters was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rand worshipped a psychopath a sadistic murderer named William Edward Hickman who was said to have committed the most horrific crime of the 1920s . Hickman kidnapped , murdered , and mutilated the corpse of a twelve-year old girl . Rand planned to write a novel with the hero bearing Hickmans arrogant attitude . She did not complete the novel , but there are echoes of Hickman in the Howard Roark character of her novel " The Fountainhead . " For all the details , see New York Times writer Michael Prescotts account . <p> In typical psychopath fashion , Rands entire philosophy rested upon the fact that humans were inherently greedy and self-interested . In fact , humans are just the opposite . We evolved to live in small bands of hunter-gatherers that worked together as a team , helping each other not preying upon each other . Read more in Ayn Rand vs. the Pygmies at Slate.com . <p> And so today we live with the horror of knowing that the global economic system that is mauling the American middle class was designed by psychopaths . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranoid by their condition , and are compelled to watch us as closely as possible . <h> The Age of Psychopathic Surveillance <p> More and more , American workers and even high-school students are being tracked with electronic devices . Perhaps there are good reasons to track people . After all , having a Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) chip in your dogs collar comes in handy when he gets lost . However , there is evidence that the brain damage suffered by psychopaths makes them paranoid . How would leaders design a government if , like psychopaths , they could only rely upon the left hemispheres of their brains ? McGilchrist speculates ( page 548 ) : <p> " Such a government would seek total control it is an essential feature of the left hemispheres take on the world that it can grasp it and control it . Talk of liberty , which is an abstract ideal for the left hemisphere , would increase for Machiavellian reasons , but individual liberty would be curtailed . Panoptical control would become an end in itself , and constant CCTV monitoring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> whether such monitoring is effective or not ; and apparently it is not . As reported by Londons Guardian newspaper : " Why CCTV has Failed to Deter Criminals . " But it makes our psychopathic rulers feel better it soothes their damaged , paranoid brains . <h> The Secret Order of the Psychopathic Elite <p> One of the things scientists do to study brain damage is to have patients make drawings . From McGilchrist ( page 287 ) : <p> " schizophrenic subjects , whose psychopathology depends on a reflexive hyperconsciousness , and who often depict a detached observing eye in their paintings , show a relative hypofunction of the right hemisphere in relation to the left . " <p> Note the " eye " paintings . Furthermore , ( from McGilchrist page 73 ) : <p> " Functional imaging of the brain shows that the left hemisphere takes a Gods eye , or invariant view , in its representation of objects , where the right hemisphere uses stored real world views in order to group experience . " <p> So , the brain damage of psychopaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a " Gods eye " perspective . Ring any bells ? If not , flip over a U.S. dollar bill and take a look at the Great Seal of the United States : <p> Is the " Eye of Providence " or the " All-Seeing Eye of God " a result of the mad scribbling of the psychopaths at the top of the human pyramid ? <p> The people residing at the top of the pyramid are also sometimes dubbed " The Illuminati " but what might be the psychological genesis of this concept of illumination ? McGilchrist ( page 429 ) : <p> " The emphasis on light in Enlightenment suggests not just clarity and precision , but of course the banishment of the darker , more negative emotions . " <p> And : <p> " the left hemisphere sees things literally as lighter , and is more prone to positive emotions . " <p> Without empathy , the suffering of the puny human-things at the bottom of the pyramid can not ruin a psychopaths day . The Illuminatus floats above it all on a cloud of brain-damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in his secret order . here 's a pyramid in front of a U.S. government building : <p> " We the people " wallow in the black mass of the lower pyramid . But who floats above us in that " lighter " capstone ? Could it be a coterie of rigid Ayn Rand supermen who are unable to discern shades of gray , but only black and white , as Rush Limbaugh likes to say ? Either you are white or black , Illuminati or sheep , predator or prey , or as Steve Jobs used to say : " enlightened or asshole " ( Isaacson , p.158 ) . This brain-damaged psychology of psychopaths might also explain the tacky black-and-white checkerboard floor pattern found in Masonic lodges ( click photo to enlarge ) : <p> Public-domain photo of the Masonic Hall in Bury St. Edmunds , Suffolk , England ) <p> Pyramids are sinister structures historically , often built by slaves , and the scene of human sacrifice . Pyramids are also a symbol of stasis they do n't  change . So , the dream of a psychopathic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human pyramid in a black-and-white struggle of predator versus prey eating what he kills ( as they say on Wall Street ) . His complete lack of scruples and psychopathic charisma give him an advantage in the ruthless people-manipulating skills required for the climb . Once at the top , he deploys his all-seeing electric eyes to make sure that the prey are not plotting against him . And as his well-ordered , human-powered Rock-a-Box funnels profits up to him , he achieves enlightenment , safely ensconced in his psychopathic utopia . <p> Yes , there are official explanations for the symbols discussed above . However , examining their visual , psychological appeal to the psychopathic mind deepens our understanding of what we are dealing with . Human nature is a constant ; it does not change . Psychopath predators have always been with us . And slavery was widespread throughout human history until only relatively recently . The truth is that modern psychopaths would just as cheerfully own or trade slaves as our ancestors did if they could get away with it if it were socially acceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the normal population . <p> Psychopaths would excel in a resurrected slave economy because they are genetically incapable of any sort of empathy . Slavery may be extinct in the USA , but that does n't  mean that mad scientists wont find a way to bring it back , like the scientists in Jurassic Park brought back the dinosaurs . And make no mistake , they dream of the day . They ca n't help it ; their brains are broken . <h> Psychopathic Certitude <p> From McGilchrist ( page 545 ) : <p> " the appearance of clarity and certainty which the left hemisphere craves . " <p> Sound familiar ? Remember the oligarchs demanding " certainty " from President Obama on the issue of extending the Bush Tax Cuts ? Wasnt that odd ? Certainty this , certainty that ; it was almost like they suffered a collective concussion and had their vocabulary reduced to a single word like the Smurfs " We must have smurfainty ! " <p> In August 2012 , the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill titled : The Family and Business Tax Cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychopaths were enshrined in the very title of the bill ! However , with trillions of dollars in sweatshop profits already squirreled away in the Cayman Islands , there was no politically conceivable tax-hike that could put more than a small dent into the oligarchs . And certainly not from Obama , who will be remembered by history as a minor functionary of the American Oligarchy . ( Note : the bill mentioned did not become law . Instead , another one did : the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 . ) <p> In August 2010 , the world was shocked by an incredible display of oligarchic paranoia from billionaire Steve Schwarzman who said of Obamas discussion of higher taxes : " Its a war . Its like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 . " Not only was his statement crazy on its face , it was also crazy in its context . After all , Obamas rhetoric will be seen by history as designed to make the bailout of Wall Street palatable to bloodthirsty voters . Only a year earlier , Obama told the bankers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitchforks . " And indeed , Obama did not punish a single oligarch for their reckless operation of the financial system when he would have been deified for doing so by the people . <h> Safe Occupations for Psychopaths <p> The psychopath gene is probably part of human nature because vicious killers incapable of feeling fear or remorse have an advantage in combat , and thus survive to propagate their genes . <p> So , what should be done with psychopaths ? Of course , we should strive for a cure , perhaps a surgical procedure could fix them . In the meantime , we might put them to work on assembly lines making harmless items like socks and mittens . But it is difficult to come up with safe occupations for them . For example , a psychopath bus driver could drive up on a sidewalk and mow down dozens of people . Nearly any job could provide opportunities for sabotage that would harm innocent people . <p> Perhaps psychopaths should be drafted into the military and kept on remote bases until their fearless brutality is needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living as mixed-martial arts fighters , competing in contests televised from their remote bases . They could build pyramid-shaped barracks , with the lower " orders " living below , and the enlightened officers living above . The pyramid would have a soothing black-and-white color scheme , as the lower orders " calculate " their future rise to power . Maybe we could give them terrorist prisoners from Guantanamo to do the construction work like Egyptian slaves . <p> Frivolity aside , psychopaths who are not abused as children appear to be able to lead peaceful , law-abiding lives . The psychopath genes do n't  take over if the childs early environmental conditions do not warrant an extreme response . So , it should not be too difficult to identify the people who must be kept from the levers of power . <h> Ending the Age of the Psychopath <p> The psychopaths among us are obviously a problem . However , the normal people acting like psychopaths will need to be addressed by a different approach . We humans are adapted to living in small bands of cooperating individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands , but nothing to even approach todays vast chasms of wealth and power . <p> We are simply not physically adapted to live as we currently do . Would we thrive better in a more egalitarian society ? Maybe so . That 's exactly what seems to have happened in Finland . The Nordic nations students have been scoring above their counterparts around the world in recent years , and their secret is an egalitarian school system . ( Read more in The Atlantic . ) <p> By contrast , our oligarchs are trying to smash teacher unions and privatize schools . In Finland , all the schools are public , unionized , free , and provide free meals to students . All the schools are the same . Remarkably , the Finns did not set out with the goal of higher test scores , but only to make their system more egalitarian . The stellar test performance was an unexpected surprise . So , Finlands model is crushing our model . Why ? Perhaps because humans automatically function better in an egalitarian , cooperative environment because it is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should we not immediately switch our school system over to their model ? After all , the oligarchs are always preaching that we must have better-educated workers if they are ever to stop exporting jobs . Well , here is the solution a proven solution that we could easily implement . So , the oligarchs must be rushing to make it happen , right ? Wrong . <p> To a psychopath , there must be a social hierarchy . There must be lowly plebs available to be harnessed to his will . All functions of society must be available to be improved by his management " genius . " Schools must train the plebeian children to be docile worker bees , and passive consumers . After all , how else could our psychopath do gods work ? The more plebs and resources under his command , the greater deeds he can do . And so , our psychopaths are more likely to declare war on Finland than they are to emulate that " socialist " nation . <p> Ironically , residents of Europes " socialist " nations vacation in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marchand and Meffre have published a book titled The Ruins of Detroit . You can see some photos from the book on their website . Here is a quote : <p> " Detroit presents all archetypal buildings of an American city in a state of mummification . Its splendid decaying monuments are , no less than the Pyramids of Egypt , the Coliseum of Rome , or the Acropolis in Athens , remnants of the passing of a great Empire . " <p> American oligarchs counter that the blame for the appalling state of Detroit lies with the labor unions that have chased all the jobs away . However , if labor unions are inherently toxic ( as presented in this CNBC video ) , why did the same thing not happen in Germany ? Why does Stuttgart thrive while Detroit crumbles ? Using oligarchic logic , one would think that things would be even worse in Germany where the law mandates that labor unions have a seat on the board of directors of large companies , a doctrine called co-determination . As usual , the oligarchs are intellectually bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and no rapacious oligarchy looting with reckless abandon . <p> And of course , the carnage in the USA is not limited to labor-union strongholds like Michigan . There are numerous cracks in our system . <p> Can we continue to offshore millions of jobs , and import millions of immigrants without the system collapsing ? No , we can not . And huge cracks in the system are now visible . <h> Crack #1 Mass Poverty <p> Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that we have more people living below the poverty line ( 46.2 million ) since they began keeping statistics in 1959 ( click chart to enlarge ) : <p> The population has grown since then , and the poverty rate does n't  look quite so dire , however at 15.1% it is still tied for the worst rate since President Johnson declared the War on Poverty in 1964 : <p> The food-stamp data is reported in a more timely fashion and corroborates the poverty data : <p> What 's scary about this data is that it has not improved since the Great Recession ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , those jobs are obviously not enough to counter the continuing mass immigration and/or not paying well enough to keep workers above the poverty line . <p> On the other hand , corporate profits hit record highs during this period , so from the Oligarchys perspective , everything is just splendid . <h> Crack #2 Student Protests <p> The United Kingdom has also been " hollowed out " by globalization . In 2010 , student riots were ignited when the government tripled tuition fees as part of Londons austerity program . <p> During the Occupy Wall Street protests in the USA in 2011 , students at 136 college campuses joined in to protest higher tuition costs and poor job prospects . <p> The 2012 Quebec student protests were the largest in Canadian history . The USA is n't the only country that has lost manufacturing jobs since China was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001 . As you can see on this chart , Canada has lost nearly 600,000 factory jobs : <p> And when you lose jobs , your government loses tax revenue , and Canada had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher fees a " globalization tax " being borne by todays youth . <p> Todays students are entering the world of work with more debt and fewer opportunities than the generation of their parents . This generation of students is the first pure crop of plebs to come of age during this new era of absolute , oligarchic rule . May god have mercy on their souls . <p> Will todays students be able to pay off their student loans with the available low-wage jobs before it is time to send their children to college ? Or will the progress of Western civilization come to an end at that point ? <h> Crack #3 The Urban Intifada <p> While college students are protesting , " teens " are rampaging . Smart phones and social media have enabled a high-tech version of the " wilding " crime genre that first came to light during the Central Park Jogger Case of 1989 in which Trisha Meili was assaulted and raped by five " teens " in New Yorks Central Park . <p> Prior to smart phones and social media , these criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily inform groupies of their planned attacks and attract sizeable crowds of spectators . So , a small group of psychopaths will tweet out a time and place , the mob will assemble , and then the psychopaths will entertain them by attacking whatever innocent victims who are at hand . The disturbing part of this is that wilding has become a spectator sport , a pastime where everybody laughs it up , enjoying the show , like it is a mixed-martial arts competition . <p> In most cases , the perpetrators of these crimes are described by the news media as merely " teens " with no mention of their race . However , these criminals are overwhelmingly African-American . Perhaps it is a good idea for the media to cover up the racial aspect in the hope that the problem can be solved before a racial backlash develops . After all , a revival of the Ku Klux Klan could not be viewed as a progressive development . On the other hand , everybody needs to know about this type of street crime because it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the local mall , but today , such a media-induced , uninformed sense of security can prove fatal . <p> This author hesitates to cite the following book , however due to the nature of the medias coverage , there are no alternatives . Numerous examples of flash-mob crime can be found in " White Girl Bleed a Lot " by journalist Colin Flaherty . The book is very badly written , and contains factual errors , grammatical errors , formatting bugs , and typos in nearly every sentence as Flaherty appears to write in a state of blind rage and does not employ an editor . However , the book has a large number of Internet links to news stories , police reports , video , etc . The book takes its title from a flash-mob victims report of what her attackers said after they punched her in the face . That victim , Shaina Perry was attacked in Milwaukee in 2011 . The Journal Sentinel newspaper reported the incident in " Flynn calls looting , beatings in Riverwest barbaric . " <p> Here is a sample video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Mike " who also reports such activity being widespread at public events in the area . And indeed , many public events around the country have had to be cancelled due to such mayhem . <p> The Wall Street Journal reported on one aspect this story in " Flash Robs Vex Retailers . " ( Notice how they use the phrase " swarms of teenagers . " ) The article reports : " Retail merchandise theft rose almost 8% last year to $27 billion . " So , that would be a $2 billion increase for 2011 . ( The article was published in 2012 . ) <p> In the old days , retailers kept their merchandise behind the counter , and fetched items for customers . In order to reduce the number of clerks required , Clarence Saunders launched the first self-serve store in Memphis , Tennessee in 1916 . A century later , we have constructed a vast impoverished class , 50-million strong , and perhaps retailers will be forced to revert to the behind-the-counter model . And it would serve them right since it was retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , thus bringing into being a large portion of the vast army of impoverished Americans . <p> Of course , we do not condone criminal activity , and what follows is not absolution . However , it is a fact that while offshoring and mass-immigration have harmed the middle class , those policies have pulverized the African-American working class . So , is it any wonder that street crime is reaching Intifada levels of intensity ? <p> The primary goal of our mass-immigration policy is to wipe out labor unions , and redistribute income from workers to oligarchs . However , when most people think of unions , they think of well-paid , white auto workers Michigan or Ohio UAW workers . But many unions of black working-class people have been wiped out . For example , fifty years ago , African-Americans held all the service jobs in Miamis tourist industry . Today , they hold none ; they have been totally displaced by immigrants from south of the border . This has happened all over the country in numerous industries like airports , construction , slaughter houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . African-American citizens have been replaced by immigrants being paid lower wages . <p> " immigration causes substantial wealth redistribution . By 2000 , the model predicts that immigration reduced the total earnings accruing to native workers by about 2.8 percent of GDP and increased the income accruing to native employers by 3.1 percent of GDP . In 2002 dollars , workers lose around $278 billion while employers gain $300 billion . " <p> While conservatives like to castigate African-Americans as welfare recipients , the truth is that offshoring and mass-immigration are welfare programs for the Oligarchy funded by wages stripped away from the African-American community . <p> Note : Miamis Cubans , Haitians , Dominicans , Jamaicans , etc. are fine peoples . However , if the Oligarchy sees a chance to replace them with even cheaper workers , they wo n't hesitate to do so . Nobody should be surprised if one day huge ships carrying impoverished people from Cambodia , Egypt , or Kenya begin to arrive at the Port of Miami . And nobody should be surprised if tax dollars are used to teach them English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of this has already occurred in Palm Beach County where high-end resorts have brought in workers on H-2B visas instead of hiring locally . <p> When the Oligarchs are re-assessing their workforce , nobody is safe , and possessing American citizenship will not help you . Remember : Oligarchs regard the USA as a conquered province of their global empire , and the residents as just another natural resource to be exploited or discarded as they see fit . They do n't  recognize citizenship because they do n't  recognize national sovereignty . <p> In 2012 , comedian DL Hughley made a mockumentary for Comedy Central titled : " The Endangered List " where he lobbies the EPA to have the African-American male declared an endangered species . During the show he lectures two members of the Bloods street gang about how violent crime makes all black people look bad . One of the Bloods , Kyon , replies : <p> " Thats life . That 's the way it is . It was set up to be that way . Like its right here in this community . Give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having none of it , however that does n't  change the fact that what Kyon said is factually correct . As Cornell University labor economist Vernon Briggs pointed out , the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was followed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 . Said Briggs in this essay : <p> " the effortto raise disadvantaged urban black Americans out of poverty was undermined from the beginning by the flood of cheap foreign labor . " <p> For nearly a half-century now , African-Americans have had to compete with a never-ceasing , and ever-increasing tide of cheap labor , often flowing directly into their neighborhoods . After declaring a moratorium on immigration , and a moratorium on offshoring , and decriminalizing recreational drugs , then DL Hughley can lecture all he wants . And guess what ? He will have moral authority because the system will now be supporting his people rather than steamrolling them . <p> " Theres a brother named Dave ina Corvette Had a job at the U.P.S . I ai n't  dissin cause U.P.S . pays money But Dave wants to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When well-paid jobs are available , nobody can even rationalize choosing a life of crime . Like Sir Mix-a-Lot said , working for The Man is not a problem when The Man is paying you well like you are a man yourself and not just a disposable labor input . <p> The emergence of angry rap music and hip-hop culture is a direct result of the Oligarchys mass-immigration and de-industrialization policies .

" <p> As Ferguson was writing his book in 2011 , civilization , by his definition , came to an end in Birmingham , Alabama . Some residents are going without indoor plumbing and running water after Jefferson County was looted by the Financial Oligarchy . <p> The Oligarch Media has almost completely ignored this story , but thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security can no longer afford to pay the huge sewage bills that eat up 30-50% of their income . The bills are that high because local officials were bribed by banksters to overpay for a sewage system upgrade . According to the BBC story : <p> " Investment bank JP Morgan Securities and two of its former directors have been fined for offering bribes to Jefferson County workers and politicians to win business financing the sewer upgrade . " <p> With Paul Ryan running for Vice President on the Republican ticket , " austerity " was one of the top issues of the 2012 presidential election . However , African-American retirees in Jefferson County were already " living the life " of outhouses and bottled water thanks to an austere retirement system , and roving bands of rapacious banksters . <p> On November 9 , 2011 Jefferson Country filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy . At $4.2 billion , it was the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history . <p> Half the population of Birmingham fled a cholera outbreak in 1873 . Will we degrade back down to that level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the USA , and the Oligarchy shows no signs of ceasing its depredations . <p> Handy tip for American readers : Learn from the citizens of Detroit and add a rape alarm to your keychain to scare off packs of feral dogs . <p> Imagine a national ballot initiative : " Are you in favor of sending all middle-class jobs to Asia , and for jobs that can not be sent , re-staffing them with low-paid immigrants ? " <p> What are the chances that American citizens would vote " yes " on such an initiative ? Zero . Such a " globalization and colonization " initiative would be crushed in a massive landslide . So , what we need to do is conceptually simple : have our political leaders implement the will of the people . And while the Oligarchy appears invincible , it is indeed possible to defeat them . We have actually done it before . On numerous occasions , We The People , have forced our political leaders to defy the Oligarchy and improve the nation . Some examples : <h> Womens Suffrage <p> Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 . Seventy-two years later they succeeded when the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920 . <h> Sit-Down Strikes , and The Fair Labor Standards Act 1938 <p> The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ( FLSA ) established the minimum wage , the eight-hour workday , the forty-hour workweek , overtime pay , and abolished child labor and sweatshops . However , the FLSA was introduced in Congress in 1932 . So , what took so long ? Where was President Roosevelt during those six years ? Wasnt he pushing it ? Apparently not . The bill did not become law until The People took matters into their own hands during the sit-down strikes of 1936-1937 . Not only that , but these were " wildcat " strikes opposed by the union bosses , who only jumped on the bandwagon after the fact . <h> The Bonus Army <p> Having been paid practically nothing during World War I , soldiers had to protest to get paid . The protests began in 1932 , and the soldiers were paid four years later in 1936 . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , he vetoed the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act of 1936 , and Congress had to override his veto . <h> Vietnam War Protests <p> The People put an end to the Military-Industrial Complexs first " endless " war with mass protests during the 1960s and 1970s . <h> Civil Rights Movement <p> The civil rights enjoyed by African-Americans ( and other minorities ) today were not handed down by the Founding Fathers or any other politicians . They were won in hard-fought battles during the 1960s with protests , civil disobedience , boycotts , sit-ins , marches , etc . <h> This Time Its Different <p> Never before in American history have reformers had to contend with an all-encompassing propaganda machine like the Oligarch Media . The spectacular disintegration of the Occupy Wall Street movement is a chilling testament to the Oligarch Medias power . OWS did n't  elect a single member to Congress , or accomplish even the smallest of goals . It could n't even choose a goal . Contrast that to the reformers of the past , who were not the least bit confused about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses paid a nice dividend in 2011 , helping them to dodge the OWS bullet . The Oligarch Media is the Information Age equivalent of the Berlin Wall . <p> It is also sobering to remember that the British people never threw off their oligarchy . The British Empire went from superpower to rust-bucket with shocking speed . The USA is physically much larger than the United Kingdom , and we have far more resources . So , perhaps we will not fall as far as they did , but make no mistake , we are falling . Fast . And time is running short . <h> We Must Win <p> It is critical that we break out of this appalling Age of Globalist Carpetbagging as soon as possible . After the British Empires fall , the United Kingdom retained a measure of its status and self-respect by virtue of its " special relationship " with the USA . It seems doubtful that the Chinese will be so generous with us . They are more likely to award a contract to Foxconn to march us into sweatshops and work off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #1 The Oligarchys Split Personality <p> One minute , the Oligarchy is sending factories to China as if their heads were on fire . The next minute , they are moving military forces to the Pacific to " contain " China . This contradictory behavior is caused by the two main wings of the Oligarchy . The Financial Oligarchy , lead by Wall Street , loves China and makes money by sending American jobs there . The Military Oligarchy views China as a potential threat , and wants to contain them . <p> When looking back at history , keep in mind that the Financial Oligarchy was repressed after they crashed the stock market in 1929 , and inflicted a plague of bank failures on the nation during the 1930s . So , the Military Oligarchy reigned supreme for decades while the Financial Oligarchy agitated to be released from its stockade . <p> Once the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 , the Military Oligarchy receded a bit , and the resurgent Financial Oligarchy seized power . They reigned supreme during the 1990s , with their boy , Bill Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their plan to remove Americas borders , make it a dumping ground for their sweatshop products from the Third World , and de-industrialize in the process , was not resisted by the Military Oligarchy because they were tied down by their wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . <p> Going forward , will the Military Oligarchy rebel against the hollowing-out of their industrial base by the Financial Oligarchy ? Will they push the banksters aside and insist on re-industrialization ? This might be the middle classs only hope . And perhaps a peaceful solution could be found . After all , having a powerful industrial base , does n't  automatically require more wars of conquest . A reasonable plan would be to have the Military Oligarchy reverse the trade policies of the Financial Oligarchy through peaceful means in the name of national security . We re-industrialize , put people back to work , and upgrade our worn-out military gear to state-of-the art defensive systems the kind that can , for example , detect those Russian Akula-2 submarines . <p> Note : Of course , there is overlap between the different factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war profiteers . <h> Appendix #2 Fracking is not Enough <p> The USAs " fracking " revolution has dramatically reduced natural gas prices and some chemical companies are moving back into the USA . Toy companies might be able to come back from China because they use a lot of plastic derived from natural gas . ( Link ) However , this is not something that we should count on to create our jobs . A stronger economy will increase demand , and may push gas prices back up . Other countries can copy our technology , produce more gas , and lure our plants back as energy costs equalize again . <h> Appendix #3 Globalization is not Inherently Evil <p> During our Revolutionary Era , state militias were more eager to fight each other than they were to fight the British . It is a good thing that states no longer fight each other . It is also a good thing that the nations of the European Union no longer fight each other . And it would be a great thing if a global political union could be created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that might be feasible if the world did not have a vast oversupply of workers . But it does . And until that changes , economic integration , as currently practiced by the Oligarchy amounts to the USA being dissolved into a vast , global pool of poverty . Clearly , a fate not endorsed by the American People . <h> Appendix #4 Ronald Reagan Was Not the Turning Point <p> Many Democrats like to use Ronald Reagans presidency as the watershed event that brought the Oligarchy to power . However , the Oligarchy had an agent in the White House before Ronald Reagan . As a matter of fact , David Rockefellers Trilateral Commission had an entire management team in place : The Jimmy Carter Administration . <p> As we discussed earlier in the " The Trilateral Commission Fails " section , Carter tried , and failed , to implement Rockefellers international-trade policies . However , Carter was successful in advancing Rockefellers domestic agenda . Carter signed bills to deregulate airlines , railroads , and the trucking industry . So , as Michael Lind wrote in " Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Deal America was put into motion by the Democrat Jimmy Carter . <p> Reagan is also associated with the religious right . However , Carter was the first president to run as a born-again Christian . That was in 1976 , three years before Jerry Falwell founded his Moral Majority . Carters opponent , Gerald Ford , was also born-again , but he deliberately never politicized the fact . The Trilateralists were looking for somebody who would politicize the hell ( ha , ha ) out of it . That 's why they plucked Carter out of obscurity and got behind him : they saw the evangelical wave coming . <p> Why was the Trilateral Commission so attuned to the USAs burgeoning evangelical movement ? Because after being thrashed by the various protest movements of the 1960s and early 1970s , the Oligarchy was searching for a new horse to ride . That is one of the main themes of their 1975 book : The Crisis of Democracy . The Trilateralists were so desperate that they even considered ruling Europe through the Communists ! From page 50 : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties of order , whose leaders are the only ones able to make people work " <p> And the praise goes on . Later , on page 159 , they seem to have discussed the matter with the Communists and received assurances : <p> " In Europe , even the French and Italian communist parties have adapted themselves to the democratic game and at least assert that if admitted to power they will continue to play according to the rules of that game . " <p> Such a romance ! But it was n't meant to be because in the USA , something bigger was brewing : an evangelical Big Bang . The 1973 Roe vs . Wade decision was turning many religious people into political activists . So , in an attempt to ride that wave , the Trilateralists recruited the religious Carter . However , the decision also caused religious people in the Democratic Party to migrate over to the Republican Party . Consider the findings of religion professors Mark Silk and Andrew Walsh : <p> " By the late 1960s , the old Catholic Democratic voter bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban Catholic subculture . The Catholic working class was eroding under pressure and unhappy with the new social policies of both the church and the Democratic Party , a process accelerated by Roe v. Wade in 1973 . " <p> So , while the Oligarchy was quick to jump on the evangelical horse , with Jimmy Carter , it was the Republican party that would be the ultimate beneficiary seven years later . In 1980 , Ronald Reagan was the lucky recipient of this political mass-migration . Read more in The Soul of Neoliberalism by Bethany Moreton . <p> The moral of the story is that long before Ronald Reagan took office , David Rockefeller had his neoliberal campaign going full blast . He had pet economists like Milton Friedman madly scribbling laissez-faire tracts at his " Chicago School " of economics . He was motivating the grass roots with an evangelical candidate three years before Jerry Falwell caught onto the idea . And he captured the White House in 1976 , and began savagely slashing away at New Deal America . <p> Bashing Ronald Reagan actually helps to deflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric . This is not a partisan issue . After all , Democrats like Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton , Al Gore , and Barack Obama served the Oligarchy just as faithfully as any Republican ever did . <h> Appendix #5 Solving the Psychopath Riddle <p> The genetic brain damage found in psychopaths appears to cause destructive behavior when a child carrying the " Warrior Gene " grows up in a violent environment . Our genes provide us with many behavioral options to adapt us to the environment in which we find ourselves born into . If you had been born into " interesting times " as the Chinese say , you might want to be a psychopath since that brain structure might help you to survive . <p> In peaceful times , child abuse appears to activate the Warrior Gene . So , in addition to Dr. Robert D. Hares PCL-R psychological test , we should be able to combine a persons upbringing with brain scans and genetic testing to develop a pretty good psychopath test . <p> In 2011 , the BBCs " Horizon " show broadcast an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a top neuroscientist , James H. Fallon , discovered that he himself had the brain structure of a psychopath . As he was studying psychopaths , family members suggested that he take a look at his own brain , and informed him that he was descended from Lizzie Borden . Its a dramatic story , and has a happy ending because Fallon had a happy childhood and his Warrior Gene never got him into trouble . So , this is a fascinating example of how a psychopath scientist expanded our knowledge of psychopaths . <p> Identifying psychopaths should eventually be pretty easy . What will be challenging is deciding how to keep them from doing damage to their fellow humans without incarcerating them . <p> On a sinister note , oligarchs might use psychopath testing to find employees more suitable to overseer jobs . Imagine if all the supervisor positions in a giant warehouse could be staffed with bona fide psychopaths . Would productivity , and thus profits , rise ? Like any technology , psychopath testing could be used for good or evil , and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evil . <h> Appendix #6 Marine General Smedley Butler <p> If you look at American military history , you will see numerous interventions south of the border . What were all of those about ? After he retired from the U.S. Marines in 1931 , General Smedley Butler gave a speech shedding light on those conflicts . Here is a quote : <p> " I helped make Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street . The record of racketeering is long . I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912 . I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 . In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested . " <p> Butler was very popular and gave his speech all over the country . He later expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is available from Amazon.com , and other places online . The names of the companies above are not in the book ; probably because the publisher did n't  want to get sued . However , before the book , a pamphlet containing the speech was published . What is apparently the full text of the pamphlet is at the bottom of this page . General Butler also has a fascinating Wikipedia page . <p> 6 Most southern states adopted Right-to-Work laws in the 1940s &amp; 1950s . See the list here . The 1965 " Canada-United States Automotive Products Agreement " or the " Auto Pact " sent a large number of U.S. auto plants to Canada . At the time , wages were lower in Canada , so that was a cheap-labor deal also . Canadian wages subsequently rose to parity with American wages , and the Canadian Auto Workers earned a reputation for being more militant than the UAW . Most of the plants that moved went across the river from Detroit into Windsor &amp; southern Ontario . <p> 9 Hong Kong has a new $3.60 minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an expensive city . The woman who was featured in the documentary was already making $4 per hour working at a 7-11 store . <p> 15 Paddy Chayefsky , Network ( 1976 ) .

They may do little more than cause a degree of pain as transitions happen . <p> Far from being fatalistic about change , I am very optimistic .

Do n't  elect movie stars i guess . <p> " the limitations in how they understand society guarantee their eventual obsolescence .

Odds are that they understand society far better than anybody else , and are probably even programming it as we speak . <p> " I am very optimistic . It mostly requires we be effective in educating people " <p> Yes , but they are the ones doing the educating . They control the bulk of the media . Changing that might be possible , but it wont be easy by any stretch of the imagination . <p> There 's nothing wrong with being young and optimistic . Not at all . The only thing that I would suggest is to keep an open mind open to the possibility that there may never be a " transition . "

Edwards retired in 1951 , and Magee published the fourth and fifth editions . Magee died in 1987 , and had sold his business to Richard McDermott who published the sixth and seventh editions . There are no complaints about McDermotts handling of the book . However , before McDermott died in 2011 , he must have sold the rights to W.H.C. Bassetti , a former Magee student .

@@88484364 @3984364/ <h> Conquering the Mormons Again <p> You are probably aware that we acquired our southwestern states from Mexico in 1848 , after the Mexican-American War . But what you may not know is that we had to conquer the territory a second time ten years later from the Mormons in the Utah War . In fact , the Mormon nation of Deseret could be considered one of our conquered foes , right up there with England , Spain , Mexico , Japan , Germany , Iraq , etc . <p> Last week , there was what looked like an armed Mormon rebellion in Bunkerville , Nevada . I say " looked like " because the news media only just barely mentioned that Cliven Bundy , the rebellious cattle rancher , is a Mormon . However , until some actual journalism is done , we can consider the following : <p> Bunkerville is a Mormon town , founded by polygamist Mormon communists in 1877 . The towns population is about 1,300 , and the armed mob that ran off the Bureau of Land Management was reported to be about 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was primarily composed of Mormon townspeople . <p> Bundys apparent militia commander , former Nevada sheriff Richard Mack , is a Mormon . And Mack was enamored of the strategy of using women as human shields . Said Mack : <p> " We were actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front . If they 're gon na start shooting , its going to be women that are gon na be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers . " <p> An idea that only a polygamist could love . I do n't  know if Mack is a polygamist , but its important to note that polygamist Mormon towns were in a state of rebellion long before the Bunkerville Rebellion . Cliven Bundy has only taken the rebellion to the next level . Polygamy is against the law in the USA , and towns like Colorado City , Arizona should be fenced off and turned into FEMA camps . Its not enough to put the child-molesting cult leader Warren Jeffs in jail , and have county deputies patrol the town . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Apparently , these towns discourage people from visiting by not having gas stations and restaurants . And they have very large houses , big enough to hold polygamist families . This blogger claims to be a descendant of Joseph Smith , and says that Bunkerville exhibits all the signs of a Mormon polygamous town . <p> These are radical , fundamentalist Mormons , and there ca n't be that many of them , right ? Well , maybe not , however they say that Neo-Confederate bomb-thrower Alex Jones has a lot of Mormons in his radio audience . And Jones brags about how well-prepped his listeners are to wage war on the feds . They have stockpiled food , water , guns , ammo , and libertardian attitudes . Some Jones thralls were at Bunkerville , and Jones had an on-air orgasm when the Mormons trained their sniper rifles on the feds . <p> The moral of the story is that it is dangerous to dismiss this as a minor incident involving a persnickety old rancher and some Tea Party weirdos . In fact , Cliven Bundy has declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disarm every federal agent in the state . ( Most of the sheriffs are probably Mormons . ) This victory has emboldened Bundy , and he is eager to " bomb the next " target as Alex Jones likes to say . <p> And a second war with the Mormons might not be so easy if mainstream Mormons join with their odious fundamentalist cousins . The Mormon Mafia has deep influence , and maybe even control of the nation-security apparatus . See this Los Angeles Times story about the Mormon Mafia in the FBI . <p> On September 11 , 2001 a mystery plane flew menacingly over the White House . The Secret Service had no idea what it was or why it was violating White House airspace , so they ordered an evacuation . Staffers were told to remove their I 'd badges in case snipers were waiting outside . Women were told to take off their shoes so that they could run faster .

We were sitting at Andrews waiting to take off when the first plane hit the Trade Towers . " <p> Did Scowcroft give the order to practically strafe the White House ? Or did the pilot use his own initiative ? Were they just flying over to make sure everything was okay ? Maybe so , but why did n't  they notify the Secret Service ? When I researched this back in 2012 , I could n't find any explanation , or an interview with the pilot . All we know is that one of our top-secret Doomsday planes with Scowcroft on board terrorized the White House .

Who actually makes those decisions anyway ? Did Bush give the keys to the E-4B to Scowcroft ? Or was the president merely informed that he would not have an E-4B that day ? Who is the decider ? The Pentagon ? <p> Until we learn more about the Deep State , we must entertain the idea that it is controlled , or heavily influenced by a Mormon cabal . However , I would be shocked to see mainstream Mormons throw in with the likes of Cliven Bundy . <p> The federal government will need to push back against Bundy one way or another . The job should be given to a special task force comprised of our Mormon federal employees .

Edwards retired in 1951 , and Magee published the fourth and fifth editions . Magee died in 1987 , and had sold his business to Richard McDermott who published the sixth and seventh editions . There are no complaints about McDermotts handling of the book . However , before McDermott died in 2011 , he must have sold the rights to W.H.C. Bassetti , a former Magee student .

They kept right on exporting jobs , importing millions of immigrants to beat down wages , and sequestering the resulting trillions of profits in the Cayman Islands where they ca n't be taxed by Uncle Sam , thus causing a budget crisis . After years of " recovery " we still have mass unemployment , mass poverty , and 47 million people on food stamps . <p> And now look what 's happened : the plutocrats have a Jesuit pope getting in their face , who is , shall we say , " trickling " all over their precious trickle-down economics . <p> Take that , plutocrats ! <p> Today , the American Oligarchy worships the Golden Calf more fervently than ever . Pope Francis was not exaggerating when he wrote that free-market economics has been deified . A prime example was when the Catholic Larry Kudlow said that if the free-market dictated that all factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed ( See " Larry Kudlow is Pure Evil " Part 2 . " ) <p> Last week , Catholic billionaire Ken Langone ( of Home Depot fame ) struck back against Pope Francis by threatening to withhold donations from the Saint Patricks Cathedral renovation project . What are his chances of pressuring the Pope to walk-back his rhetoric ? Not very good , I think . As I mentioned , Pope Francis is a Jesuit , and the Jesuits are not called " Gods Marines " for nothing . Pope Francis is more likely to parachute into New York , stab the heretical Langone in the eye with a sharpened crucifix , and repo Langones " Knight of Saint Gregory " medal . <p> When Saint Ignatius founded the Society of Jesus in 1540 , his dream was to operate in the Holy Land , going around barefoot , converting people to Christianity , like Jesus . But the church deployed his Jesuits to Europe to beat back the Protestants . And that they did . The Jesuits prevented the Protestants from taking France , and re-conquered Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants about the Saint Bartholomews Day massacre : <p> " In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on September 29 of a Jesuit , Edmond Auger , encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later . " <p> Ancient history you say ? Well , it was n't so long ago that Jesuits were battling right-wing death squads in Central America . For example , in 1989 , six Jesuits were massacred in El Salvador . So , there is no chance that Ken Langone will dissuade Pope Francis from his left-wing commentary , which is normal for a Jesuit ( see : Liberation Theology ) . <p> The Jesuits are like the CIA of the Church , and now , for the first time ever , both the Black Pope and the White Pope are Jesuits . Is it significant that the Church has discarded its traditional separation-of-powers policy ? I do n't  know , but it sure was significant when the former CIA Director George H.W. Bush became president . That 's when our disastrous attempt to conquer the Middle East began . <p> So , if the Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Langone is playing right into their hands . After all , the church does need new recruits , and maybe some of the 47 million people on food stamps could be inspired to join up . <p> Ironically , the conflict between Langone and Cardinal Dolan is a conflict between plutocrats . Dolan , who is trying to raise money to finish sprucing up his palace , Saint Patricks Cathedral , is the largest property owner in New York City according to The Economist . Dolan probably oversees more than $1.5 billion of real estate . <p> So , what would Jesus do ? My guess is that he would sell the cathedral and use the money to minister to the 22,000 homeless children in New York City . <p> CNBCs , Michelle Cuckoo-Cabeza asked Cardinal Dolan if he would be taking Langones complaints to the Pope . Dolan laughed and said no . I saw the exchange on TV , but it seems to have been cut out of the video clips available on CNBC.com . But it is in the transcript : <p> MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns ? <p> CARDINAL DOLAN : ( LAUGH ) No . <p> MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA : No ? <p> CARDINAL DOLAN : No , I do n't  think so . I wont be doing that , no . No . <p> MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA : Is there any possibility of a dialogue , just to talk about the wealthy in America , that Ken Langone contends is really different than wealthy in most other parts of the world ? That there 's a uniquely American philanthropy ? <p> I doubt the church has any better economic plan than our Oligarchs do . The Jesuits would probably take us right back to a feudalistic Dark Ages . So , instead of having 47 million people on food stamps , we might have 52 million . But I must admit , I am enjoying watching Pope Francis make our Oligarchs sweat .

@@88484398 @3984398/ <h> Month : February 2009 <p> As SPY fell Friday after 2:00pm , it did so in two distinct thrusts that were retraced about .618% , and closed while engaged in a third thrust downward . So , a potential Bullish Three Drives pattern is developing . See page 220 in The Harmonic Trader . Here is the pattern so far on the SPY 1-minute chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> So , a drop to $73.24 on Monday is a potential reversal area . The equivalent level on the SPX is 729 . Since the market is so weak , a further extension of the final thrust down might occur beyond 127% to 161.8% . Those SPY/SPX levels would be $72.80 and 724.95 . <p> In the comments on Friday , I said that the market could bounce when the Russell 2000/IWM hit its November low . And the R2K is only an eyelash above its closing low on November 20th , and its intra-day low on the 21st , right now . So that is good additional evidence for a bounce after a further dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the IWM has a bullish inverted hammer candlestick on its daily chart . So , that is another piece of evidence . <p> Do you see what I 'm doing here ? I 'm using three different approaches to build a case : harmonics , traditional support/resistance , and Japanese candlesticks . I will continue studying the problem from different angles and see if I can strengthen case further . <p> The next angle is sentiment . As I mentioned in the comments on Friday , people on CNBC were euphoric over " The Amazing -199 Point Rally ' " . In fact , you can see Maria Bartiromo praising the market while it was falling at 3:45 into this interview with Robert Prechter on CNBC Friday afternoon ( sorry , CNBC took down the video ) . <p> That went on all day . As we have been discussing in the comments , there was no panic as the SPX took out a major low . In fact , there was quite a lot of bullish cheerfulness as reflected in such indicators as the put/call ratio . So , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far because so many traders have probably already placed their bullish bets . <p> Now let 's do a gap analysis : <p> First , let 's consider that the Gap of Doom was a " continuation gap " continuing the move down from the February 2nd top . Here is what the textbook says about such gaps on page 219 : <p> Its inference is that prices will go as much farther beyond the gap as they already have gone between the beginning of the move and the gap , as measured directly ( and vertically ) on the chart . <p> And indeed , if you look at the Fibonacci retracement I have drawn on the chart , you can see that the Gap of Doom is placed neatly in the middle of the wave down from the top on February 9th to to the close on Friday . In fact , the top of the gap is right at the 61.8% fib ( blue line and blue arrow ) and the bottom is right at the 50% mark ( green line and green arrow ) . <p> Prices snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G " on the chart ) , so it is possible that that was an exhaustion gap which may terminate the wave . Also , during the day Friday , I said in the comments that I was shorting as SPY filled the gap at point " X " . Prices usually reverse when gaps are filled , so I was just fading the gap . However , the fact that SPY was able to fill just about all of the gap is actually bullish because it ate away at most of the resistance there . So , if SPY can climb back up to the " X " , it has a good chance of being able to eventually punch through . <p> This chart shows some potential rally targets : <p> The market has two downtrend lines : The 2009 downtrend line ( upper blue ) , and the February downtrend line ( black ) . I have also made an exact parallel to the upper blue line to form a potential downtrend channel . <p> SPY may want to drop a bit more to tag the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to recapture the black line , it will likely embark upon an even steeper dive . The purple and yellow lines are potential Fibonacci resistance levels , and the blue " X " marks an ideal spot for shorting . There is triple resistance there from the blue downtrend line , the Gap of Doom , and the turquoise line , which would be a 50% retracement of the drop from February 9th . That 's about 805 for the SPX . <p> As Phil mentioned , there is a full moon on March 11th , so a rally up to the blue " X " around that time would likely bring out the same **33;116;TOOLONG that we saw at the full-moon peak on February 9th . Wouldnt that be a beautiful shorting setup ? <p> Also on the chart , notice the volume at the November low ( black circle ) , and the volume last week ( blue circle ) .

Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views . <p> You may have also found people saying that you cant use a timer to update the GUI . Seems odd , right ? Why would Google make a timer and then not let you use it for hardly anything ? <p> Well , those people are wrong . While you cant update the GUI directly from your timer , you can do so with a few little tweaks . <p> The error above happens because Android does n't  want other threads , such as your timer , messing with its GUI . So , what you need to do is politely ask Android to make the update for you . To do that , you need to add a handler and a runnable . Android will monitor the handler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal , it will run the code in the runnable . It sounds complicated , but it amounts to only a few lines of code . <p> First , move the code that updates the GUI out of your timer and into a runnable . A runnable is a mechanism where one thread can tell another thread to run a block of code . In this example , there is one line of code which sets the TextView tv to the value of the global variable i : <p> Why does Android do this , while other operating systems do not ? The fact is that none of the major operating systems have thread-safe GUI frameworks , and updating the GUI from a thread is a bad idea that can lead to difficult-to-trace bugs . <p> For example , suppose you have a thread that updates a text control on a window , and the user closes the window . Your thread may still be running , and cause an error when it tries to update the text control that no longer exists . It is possible to code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be constantly checking to see if the controls it wants to update still exist . <p> So , Android eliminates a whole class of bugs with its thread/GUI policy . And you will likely see more of this in the future . For example , the Xojo language now follows the same policy . <p> I use the code above in my BlubberPatrol weight-loss app . So , you can install that from the Google Play Store and see how well it works .

So , I was jolted to hear him singing the praises of Chris Stapleton and his Traveler album recently . <p> Sterns praise was not delivered as a commercial , but as seemingly natural conversation on the show . As if Stern genuinely admired Stapleton . However , it was poorly executed . The last comment I heard from him was : " I hate country music , except for that guy with the beard . What was his name again ?

Even Fred was praising Stapleton . <p> Back before the internet , I got fed up with buying albums from name-brand musicians that had one good song and eleven duds . So , I decided to not buy any album that did n't  get a top rating from Rolling Stone magazine . I picked up an issue , and they gave the new Van Halen album a perfect score .

On numerous occasions , the information has helped to bring public attention to the misuse of conversion tactics . <p> Some government agencies do n't  want this information generally known , for the techniques are used in armed forces basic training . Some Christian Fundamentalists , cults , and human-potential trainings would also prefer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . <p> I 'm going to talk about conversion , which is a nice word for brainwashing . Everything Ill share only exposes the surface of the problem . I do n't  know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped other than through public awareness . It is n't possible to legislate against what often can not be detected ; and if those who legislate are using these techniques , there is little hope of affecting laws to govern usage . <p> In talking about mind manipulation , I am talking about my own business . I know it , and I know how effective it can be . I produce hypnosis and subliminal tapes and , in some of my seminars , I use conversion tactics to assist participants to become independent and self-sufficient . But , any time I use these techniques , I point out that I am using them , and those attending have a choice to participate or not . They 're also aware of the desired result of participation . <p> So , to begin , I want to share a basic fact about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE HAS EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED AND REALIZED , OR BELIEVED , THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED . Those who have been brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators , claiming they have simply been " shown the light " or have been transformed in miraculous ways . <p> Any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in eighteenth century America . Apparently , Jonathan Edwards accidentally discovered the techniques during a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton , Massachusetts . By inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension , the sinners attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit . Technically , what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming . He would tell those attending , " You 're a sinner ! Youre destined for hell ! " <p> As a result , one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide . The neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they , too , were affected so deeply that , although they had found " eternal salvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lives . <p> Once a preacher , cult leader , manipulator or authority figure creates the brain phrase to wipe the brain-slate clean , his subjects are open to new programming . New input , in the form of suggestions , can be substituted for their previous ideas . Because Edwards did n't  turn his message positive until the end of the revival , many accepted the negative suggestions and acted , or desired to act , upon them . <p> Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York . The techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists , cults , human-potential training , some business rallies , and the U.S. armed services . <p> Let me point out here that I do n't  think most revivalist preachers realize or know they are using brainwashing techniques . Edwards simply stumbled upon a technique that worked , and others copied it and have continued to copy it for over two hundred years . And the more sophisticated our knowledge and technology become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the major reasons for the increasing rise in Christian fundamentalism , especially the televised variety , while most of the orthodox religions are declining . <p> The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate brainwashing , but we have to look to Pavlov , the Russian scientist , for a technical explanation . In the early 1900s , his work with animals opened the door to further investigations with humans . After the revolution in Russia , Lenin was quick to see the potential of applying Pavlovs research to his own ends . <p> Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were identified by Pavlov . The first is the Equivalent phase , in which the brain gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli . Second is the Paradoxical phase , in which the brain responds more actively to weak stimuli than to strong . Third is the Ultra-Paradoxical phase , in which conditioned responses and behavior patterns turn from positive to negative or from negative to positive . <p> With the progressions through each phase , the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve conversion are many and varied , but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual or group until they reach an abnormal level of anger , fear , excitement or nervous tension . <p> The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgment and increase suggestibility . The more this condition can be maintained or intensified , the more it compounds . Once catharsis or the first brain phase is reached , the complete mental takeover becomes easier . Existing mental programming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and behavior . <p> Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain functions are fasting , radical or high sugar diets , physical discomforts , regulation of breathing , mantra chanting in meditation , the disclosure of awesome mysteries , special lighting and sound effects , programmed response to incense , or intoxicating drugs . <p> The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment by electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a patients blood sugar level with insulin injections . <p> Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two distinctly different things and that conversion techniques are far more powerful . However , the two are often mixedwith powerful results . <p> If you 'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work , there are probably several in your city . Go to the church or tent early and sit in the rear , about three-quarters of the way back . Most likely repetitive music will be played while the people come in for the service . A repetitive beat , ideally ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute ( a rhythm close to the beat of a human heart ) is very hypnotic and can generate an eyes-open altered state of consciousness in a high percentage of people . And , once you are in an Alpha state , you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in full Beta consciousness . The music is probably the same for every service , or incorporates the same beat , and many of the people will go into an altered state almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state of mind from previous services and respond according to the post-hypnotic programming . <p> Watch the people waiting for the service to begin . Many will exhibit external signs of trance body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes . Often , they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air while sitting in their chairs . Next , the assistant pastor will come out . He usually speaks with a " voice roll . " <p> A " voice roll " is a patterned , paced style used by hypnotists when inducing a trance . It is also used by many lawyers ( several of the most famous are highly trained hypnotists ) when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors . A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome , or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous , patterned style . The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 35 to 60 beats per minute , maximizing the hypnotic effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . He induces an altered state of consciousness and/or begins to generate the excitement and the expectations of the audience . Next , a group of young women in " sweet and pure " chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song . Gospel songs are great for building excitement and involvement . In the middle of the song , one of the girls might be " smitten by the Spirit " and fall down or react as if possessed by the Holy Spirit . This effectively increases the intense atmosphere in the room . At this point , hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed . And the result is the audiences attention is now totally focused upon the communication while the environment becomes more exciting or tense . <p> Right about this time , when an eyes-open mass-induced Alpha mental level has been achieved , they will usually pass the collection plate . In the background , a 45-beat-per-minute voice roll from the assistant preacher might exhort , " Give to GodGive to GodGive to God " And the audience does give . God may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Next , the fire-and-brimstone preacher will come out . He induces fear and increases the tension by talking about " the devil " , " going to hell " or the forthcoming Armageddon . <p> In the last such rally I attended , the preacher talked about the blood that would soon be running out of every faucet in the land . He was also obsessed with a " bloody ax of God , " which attendees had seen hanging above the pulpit the previous week . I have no doubt that some people saw it the power of suggestion given to a group of people in hypnosis assures that at least 10 to 25 percent would see whatever he suggested they see . <p> In most revivalist gatherings , " testifying " or " witnessing " usually follows the fear-based sermon . People from the audience come up on stage and relate their stories . " I was crippled and now I can walk ! " " I had arthritis and now its gone ! " It is a psychological manipulation that works . After listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the audience with a minor problem is sure he can be healed . The room is charged with fear , guilt , intense excitement and expectations . <p> Now those who want to be healed are frequently lined up around the edge of the room , or they are told to come down to the front . The preacher might touch them on the head firmly and scream , " Be healed ! " This releases the psychic energy and , for many , catharsis results . Catharsis is a purging of repressed emotions . Individuals might cry , fall down or even go into spasms . And if catharsis is effected , they stand a chance of being healed . In catharsis , the brain-slate is temporarily wiped clean and the new suggestion is accepted . <p> For some , the healing may be permanent . For many , it will last four days to a week a week is , incidentally , how long a hypnotic suggestion given to a somnambulistic subject will usually last . Even if the healing does n't  last , if they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problemor sometimes , sadly , it can mask a physical problem which could prove to be very detrimental to the individual in the long run . <p> I 'm not saying that legitimate healings do not take place . They do . Maybe the individual was ready to let go of the negativity that caused the problem in the first place ; maybe it was the work of God . Yet I contend that it can be explained with existing knowledge of brain/mind function . <p> The techniques and staging will vary from church to church . Many use " speaking in tongues " to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in the observers . <p> The use of hypnotic and conversion techniques by religions is sophisticated , and professionals are assuring that they become evermore effective . A man in Los Angeles is designing , building and reworking a lot of churches around the county . He tells ministers what they need and how to use it . This mans track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income will double if the minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting . <p> Powerful sound and the proper use of lighting are of primary importance in inducing an altered state of consciousness Ive been using them for years in my own seminars . However , my participants are fully aware of the process and what they can expect as a result of their participation . <p> Cults and human-potential training companies are always looking for new converts . To attain them , many use conversion tactics , which must be effective within a short space of time usually a weekend , but in some cases as quickly as a single day . The following are the six primary techniques used to generate the conversion . <p> Conversion Tactic 1 : The meetings or training takes place in an area where participants are cut off from the outside world : a private home , a remote or rural setting , or a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed only limited bathroom usage . In human-potential trainings , the controllers will give a lengthy talk about the importance of " keeping agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't  keep your agreements , your life will never work . " Generally , this is good advice , but the controllers are subverting a positive human value for selfish purposes . The participants vow to themselves and their trainer that they will keep their agreements . Anyone who does n't concur will be intimidated into agreement or forced to leave the training . The next step is to get the participants to agree to complete the training , thus assuring a high percentage of conversions for the organization . They will usually have to agree not to take drugs , smoke and sometimes not to eator they are given such a short meal break that it creates tension . One of the real reasons for the agreements is to alter internal chemistry , which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a slight malfunction of the nervous system , which in turn increases the conversion potential . <p> Before the gathering is complete , the agreements manipulation will be used to ensure that the new converts go out and find new participants . They are intimidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the importance of keeping agreements is so high on their priority list , the converts will twist the arms of everyone they know , attempting to talk them into attending the free introductory session offered at a future date by the training organization . The new converts are zealots . The inside term for merchandising one of the largest and most successful human-potential trainings is , " sell it by zealot ! " <p> At least a million people are graduates and a good percentage have been left with a mental activation button that assures their future loyalty and assistance if the guru figure or organization calls . Think about the potential political implications of hundreds of thousands of zealots programmed to campaign for their guru . <p> Be wary of an organization of this type that offers follow-up sessions after the seminar . Follow-up sessions might be weekly meetings or inexpensive seminars given on a regular basis which the organization will attempt to talk you into taking . These regularly scheduled events are used to maintain control . As the early Christian revivalists found , long-term control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tactic 2 : A schedule is maintained that causes physical and mental fatigue . This is primarily accomplished by long hours in which the participants are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection . <p> Conversion Tactic 3 : Techniques are used to increase the tension in the room or environment . <p> Conversion Tactic 4 : Uncertainty . One of the most effective ways of creating uncertainty is to subject the participants to the fear of being " put on the spot " or encountered by the trainers who play upon guilt feelings , or convince the participants to verbally relate their innermost secrets in front of the others . Activities that emphasize the removal of masks is another powerful ploy . One of the most successful human-potential seminars forces the participants to stand on a stage in front of the entire audience while being verbally attacked by the trainers . A public poll showed that the most fearful of all situations is to speak to an audience . It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office building . So you can imagine the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed to complete the training . Many faint , but most cope with the stress by mentally going away . They literally go into an Alpha state , which automatically opens them to being 25 to 200 times more suggestible . And another loop of the downward spiral into conversion is successfully effected . <p> Conversion Tactic 5 : The introduction of jargon new terms that have meaning only to the " insiders " who have participated in the training . Vicious language is also frequently used to purposely make participants uncomfortable . <p> Conversion Tactic 6 : There is no humor in the communications until the participants are converted . Then , merry-making and humor are highly desirable as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly " found . " <p> I 'm not saying that good does not result from participation in such gatherings . But it is important for people to know what has happened and to be aware that continual involvement may not be in their best interest . <p> Over the years , I 've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be hypnotists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who conduct human-potential training and rallies ( from the training companies who use the tactics I 've just described ) come to me and say , " I know what I 'm doing works , but I do n't  know why . " After showing them how and why , many have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner . <p> Many of these trainers have become personal friends , and it scares us all to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full of people . Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of conversion . The sad truth is that a high percentage of people seem to want to become true believers and give away their power . <p> Cult gatherings or human-potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe firsthand what is technically called the " Stockholm Syndrome . " This is a situation in which those who are intimidated , controlled or made to suffer , begin to love , admire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let me inject a word of warning here : If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected , you are probably wrong . A perfect example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Haitian Voodoo . In her report , she related how the music eventually induced uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness . Although she understood the process and thought herself above it , when she began to feel herself become vulnerable to the music , she attempted to fight it and turned away . Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion . A few moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance around the Voodoo meeting house . A brain phase had been induced by the music and excitement , and she awoke feeling reborn . The only hope of attending such gatherings without being affected is to be the Buddha and allow no positive or negative emotions to surface . Few people are capable of such detachment . <p> I once attended EST ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , although a current incarnation of the seminar is called The Forum . My goal in attending was to be an observer to be Buddha throughout the process , which took place in a Phoenix hotel ballroom with 200 people attending . I remained detached until late afternoon of the final day , when a doctor stood up and accused the EST trainer of using brainwashing tactics . The incensed trainer argued back , using ridiculous Zen riddles to try to intimidate the doctor . <p> After 45 minutes of ranting , the trainer began using the other participants against the protesting doctor , who was speaking the truth . That did it . I stood up , snapped a karate kick at an EST staffer and took a spare microphone out of his hands ( the kick was to distract and did not inflict pain ) . Then I verbally went after the trainer . He responded by yelling for his people to call the police . Both the doctor and I walked out of the training room as the police arrived . I 'm probably still listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before leaving the six conversion tactics , I should mention military boot camp . The Marine Corps talks about breaking men down before rebuilding them as new men as marines . That is exactly what they do , the same way a cult breaks its people down and rebuilds them as happy flower sellers on your local street corner . Every one of the six conversion techniques are used in boot camp . Considering the needs of the military , I 'm not making a judgment as to whether this is good or bad . As a simple fact , these men are brainwashed . Those who wont submit must be discharged or spend much of their time in the brig . <p> Once the initial conversion is effected , cults , armed services , and similar groups can not have cynicism among their members . Members must respond to commands and do as they are told , otherwise , they are dangerous to the organizational control . This is normally accomplished as a three-step Decognition Process . <p> Step One is Alertness Reduction : The controllers cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fantasy and reality . This can be accomplished in several always . Poor diet is one ; watch out for brownies and Kool-Aid . The sugar throws the nervous system off . More subtle is the " spiritual diet " used by many cults . They eat only vegetables and fruits ; without the grounding of grains , nuts , seeds , dairy products , fish , or meat , an individual becomes mentally spacey . Inadequate sleep is another primary way to reduce alertness , especially when combined with long hours of work or intense physical activity . Being bombarded with intense and unique experiences achieves the same result . <p> Step Two is Programmed Confusion : You are mentally assaulted while your alertness is being reduced as in Step One . This is accomplished with a deluge of new information , lectures , discussion groups , encounters or one-to-one processing , which usually amounts to the controller bombarding the individual with questions . During this phase of decognition , reality and illusion often merge and perverted logic is likely to be accepted . <p> Step Three is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go flat **30;151;TOOLONG techniques that initially induce calmness by giving the mind something simple to deal with that focuses awareness . The continued use brings on a feeling of elation and eventually hallucination . The result is the reduction of thought and eventually , if used long enough , the cessation of all thought and withdrawal from everyone and everything except that which the controllers direct . The mental takeover is then complete . It is important to be aware that when members or participants are instructed to use thought-stopping techniques , they are told that they will benefit by so doing : they will become better soldiers or attain enlightenment . <p> There are three primary techniques used for thought stopping . The first is Marching : The thump , thump , thump beat literally generates self-hypnosis and thus greater susceptibility to suggestion . In the early stages of his rise to power , Adolph Hitler used marching demonstrations and the excitement as a mass conversion technique for those attending his rallies , and in the decognition phase for his soldiers . <p> The second thought-stopping technique is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in meditation , after a few weeks , there is high probability that you will not return to full Beta consciousness . You will remain in a fixed state of Alpha for as long as you continue to meditate . I 'm not saying this is bad . If you do it yourself , it may be very beneficial . But know that you are causing your mind to go flat . I 've worked with meditators on an EEG machine and the results are conclusive : the more you meditate , the flatter your mind becomes until , eventually and especially if used to excess or in combination with decognition , all thought ceases . Some spiritual groups call this nirvana which is just another manipulation . The mental state is simply a predictable physiological result . If heaven on earth is non-thinking and non-involvement , I really question why we are here . <p> The third thought-stopping technique is Chanting , and often chanting in meditation . Speaking in tongues could also be included in this category . <p> All three thought-stopping techniques produce an altered state of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , for you also control the input . I personally use at least one self-hypnosis programming session every day and I know how beneficial it is for me . But you need to know if you use these techniques to the degree of remaining continually in Alpha that , although you 'll be very mellow , you 'll also be more suggestible . <p> Before ending this section , I want to talk about the people who are most susceptible to conversion and joining mass movements . I am convinced that at least a third of the population are what Eric Hoffer calls true believers . They are joiners and followerspeople who want to give away their power . They look for answers , meaning and enlightenment outside themselves . <p> Hoffers book The True Believer ( Harper &amp; Row , 1951 ) is a classic on mass movements . He says , " True believers are not intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self , but are those craving to be rid of an unwanted self . They are followers , not because of a desire for self-advancement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hoffer also says that true believers " are eternally incomplete and eternally insecure . " <p> In my years of conducting seminar trainings , I have constantly run into true believers . All I can do is advise them to seek the True Self within , where meaningful personal answers will be found . I teach that the basics of spirituality are self-responsibility ( karma ) and the attainment of self-actualization ( being compassionate , while also accepting others without judgment , expectations , blame or attempting to control . ) But most of the true believers just tell me that I 'm not spiritual and go looking for someone who will give them the dogma and structure they desire . <p> Never underestimate the potential danger of these people . They can easily be molded into fanatics who will gladly work and die for their holy cause . It is a substitute for their lost faith in themselves and offers a substitute for individual hope . Hitlers Brown Shirts were true believers . The Moral Majority is made up of true believers . All cults are composed of true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses and social-cause groups . They are the fanatics in these organizations . <p> Mass Movements will usually have a charismatic leader . The followers want to convert others to their way of living or impose a new way of life if necessary , by legislating laws forcing others to their view , as evidenced by the activities of the Moral Majority . This means enforcement by guns or punishment , which is the bottom line in law enforcement . <p> A common hatred , enemy , or devil is essential to the success of a mass movement . Hitlers devil was the Jews ; the Born-Again Christians have Satan himself , but that is n't enough they 've added the New Age and all who oppose their integration of church and politics , as evidenced in the political reelection campaigns against those who oppose their views . In revolutions , the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy . Some human-potential movements are far too clever to ask their graduates to join anything , thus labeling themselves a cult but , upon close examination , you 'll find that their devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are mass movements without devils but they seldom attain major status . True believers are mentally unbalanced or insecure people , or those without hope or friends . People do n't  look for allies when they love , but they do when they hate or become obsessed with a cause . And those who desire a new life and a new order feel the old ways must be eliminated before the new order can be built . <p> Persuasion is n't technically brainwashing , but it is a manipulation of the human mind , without the manipulated party being aware what caused his opinion shift . I only have time to very basically introduce you to a few of the many techniques in use today , but the basis of persuasion is always to access your right brain . The left half of your brain is analytical and rational . The right half is creative and imaginative . That is overly simplified but it makes my point . So , the idea is to distract the left brain and keep it busy . Ideally , the persuader generates an eyes-open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beta awareness into Alpha a shift that can be measured on an EEG machine . <p> First , let me give you an example of distracting the left brain . Politicians use these powerful techniques all the time ; lawyers use many variations which , I 've been told , they call tightening the noose . <p> Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech . First , he might generate what is called a yes set . These are statements that will cause most listeners to agree ; they might even unknowingly nod their heads in agreement . Next come the truisms . These are usually facts that could be debated but , once the politician has his audience agreeing , the odds are in the politicians favor that the audience wont stop to think for themselves , thus continuing to agree . Last comes the suggestion . This is what the politician wants you to do and , since you 've been agreeing all along , you could be persuaded to accept the suggestion . Now , if you 'll listen closely to my political speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes set , the next three are truisms and the last is the suggestion . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen : are you angry about high food prices ? Are you tired of astronomical gas prices ? Are you sick of out-of-control inflation ? Well , you know the Other Party allowed 18 percent inflation last year ; you know crime has increased 50 percent nationwide in the last 12 months , and you know your paycheck hardly covers your expenses any more . Well , the answer to resolving these problems is to elect me , John Jones , to the U.S. Senate . " <p> Youve heard it all before . But you might also watch for what are called Imbedded Commands . As an example : On key words , the speaker makes a gesture with his left hand , which research has shown is more apt to access your right brain . Todays media oriented politicians and spellbinders are often carefully trained by a whole new breed of specialists who are using every trick in the book both old and new to manipulate you into accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so heavily protected that I found out the hard way that to even talk about them publicly or in print results in threatened legal action . Yet Neurolinguistics training is readily available to anyone willing to devote the time and pay the price . It is some of the most subtle and powerful manipulation Ive ever seen . A good friend who recently attended a two-week seminar on Neurolinguistics found that many of those she talked to during the breaks were government people . <p> Another slippery manipulation is called an interspersal technique and the idea is to say one thing with words but plant a subconscious impression of something else in the minds of the listeners and viewers . <p> As an example , assume you are watching a television commentator make the following statement : " Senator Johnson is assisting local authorities to clear up the stupid mistakes of the companies contributing to the nuclear waste problems . " It sounds like a statement of fact , but if the speaker emphasizes the right word and especially if he makes the proper hand gestures on the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Senator Johnson is stupid . That was the subliminal goal of the statement and the speaker can not be sued for libel . <p> Persuasion techniques are also frequently used on a much smaller scale with just as much effectiveness . The insurance salesman knows his pitch is likely to be more effective if he can get you to visualize something in your mind . This is right-brain communication . For instance , he might pause in his conversation , look slowly around your living room and say , " Can you just imagine this beautiful home burning to the ground ? " Of course you can ! It is one of your unconscious fears and in forcing you to visualize it , you are more likely to be manipulated into signing his insurance policy . <p> The cults , operating in every airport , use what I call shock and confusion techniques to distract the left brain and communicate directly with the right brain . While waiting for a plane , I once watched one operate for over an hour . He had a technique of almost jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud then dropped as he made his pitch to take a book and contribute money to the cause . Usually , when people are shocked , they immediately withdraw . In this case they were shocked by the strange appearance , sudden materialization and loud voice of the devotee . In other words , the people went into an Alpha state for security because they did n't  want to confront the reality before them . In Alpha , they were highly suggestible so they responded to the suggestion of taking the book ; the moment they took the book , they felt guilty and responded to the second suggestion : give money . We are all conditioned that if someone gives us something , we have to give them something in return . While watching this hustler , I was close enough to notice that many of the people he stopped exhibited an outward sign of Alpha their eyes dilated . <p> Subliminals are hidden suggestions , perceived only by your subconscious mind . They can be audio suggestions , hidden behind music , or visual suggestions airbrushed or cleverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a screen so fast that you do n't  consciously see them . <p> Some subliminal programming tapes offer verbal suggestions recorded at a low volume . I question the efficacy of this technique if subliminals are not perceptible , they can not be effective , and subliminals recorded below the audible threshold are therefore useless . The oldest audio subliminal technique uses a voice that follows the volume of the music so subliminals are impossible to detect without a parametric equalizer . But this technique is patented and , when I wanted to develop my own line of subliminal audio cassettes , negotiations with the patent holder proved to be unsatisfactory . My attorney obtained copies of the patents which I gave to talented Hollywood sound engineers , asking them to create a new technique . They found a way to psycho-acoustically modify and synthesize the suggestions so that they are projected in the same chord and frequency as the music , thus giving them the effect of being part of the music . But we found that in using this technique , there is no way to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the suggestions are being heard by the subconscious mind , they can not be monitored with even the most sophisticated equipment . <p> If we were able to come up with this technique as easily as we did , I can only imagine how sophisticated the technology has become , with government or advertising funding . And I shudder to think about the propaganda and commercial manipulation that we are exposed to on a daily basis . There is simply no way to know what is behind the music you hear . It may even be possible to hide a second voice behind the voice to which you are listening . <p> The series of books by Bryan Key , Ph.D . on subliminals in advertising and political campaigns , well documents the misuse in many areas , especially printed advertising in newspapers , magazines and posters . <p> The big question about subliminals is : do they work ? Based upon the response from those who have used my tapes , the answer is yes . Subliminal suggestions behind the music in department stores can be advising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain reported a 37 percent reduction in thefts in the first nine months of testing . <p> A 1984 article in the technical newsletter Brain-Mind Bulletin states that as much as 99 percent of our cognitive activity may be non-conscious , according to the director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at the University of Illinois . The lengthy report ends with the statement , " these findings support the use of subliminal approaches such as taped suggestions for weight loss and the therapeutic use of hypnosis and Neuro-linguistic programming . " <p> I could relate many stories that support subliminal programming , but I 'd rather use my time to make you aware of even more subtle uses of such programming . <p> I have personally experienced sitting in a Los Angeles auditorium with over ten thousand people who were gathered to listen to a charismatic figure . Twenty minutes after entering the auditorium , I became aware that I was going in and out of an altered state . Those accompanying me experienced the same thing . Since it is our business , we were aware of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful observation , what appeared to be spontaneous demonstrations were , in fact , artful manipulations . The only way I could figure how the eyes-open trance had been induced was to pipe a 6- to 7-cycle-per-second vibration into the room behind the air conditioner sound . That vibration generates Alpha , which would render the audience highly susceptible . Ten to 25 percent of the population is capable of a somnambulistic trance level . For these people , the suggestions of the speaker could potentially be accepted as commands . <p> Vibrato is the tremulous effect imparted in some vocal or instrumental music , and the cycle-per-second range causes people to go into an altered state of consciousness . At one period of English history , singers whose voices contained pronounced vibrato were not allowed to perform publicly because listeners would go into an altered state and have fantasies , often sexual in nature . <p> People who attend opera or enjoy listening to singers like Mario Lanza are familiar with this altered state induced by the performers . <p> Now , let 's carry this awareness a little farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . These are electromagnetic in nature . One of the primary uses of ELFs is to communicate with our submarines . Dr. Andrija Puharich , a highly respected researcher , in an attempt to warn U.S. officials about Russian use of ELFs , set up an experiment . Volunteers were wired so their brain waves could be measured on an EEG . They were then sealed in a metal room that could not be penetrated by a normal signal . <p> Puharich then beamed ELF waves at the volunteers . ELFs go right through the earth and right through metal walls . Those inside couldnt know if the signal was or was not being sent . And Puharich watched the reactions on the technical equipment : Thirty percent of those inside the room were taken over by the ELF signal in six to ten seconds . <p> When I say taken over , I mean their behavior followed the changes anticipated at very precise frequencies . Waves below 6 cycles per second caused the subjects to become emotionally upset , and even disrupted bodily functions . At 8.2 cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterful meditation , learned over a period of years . Eleven to 11.3 cycles induced waves of depressed agitation which could lead to riotous behavior . <p> Dr. Patrick Flanagan is a personal friend . In the early 1960s , as a teenager , Pat was listed as one of the top scientists in the world by Life magazine . Among his many inventions was a device he called the Neurophone an electronic instrument that can successfully program suggestions directly through contact with the skin . When he attempted to patent the device , the government demanded that he prove it worked . When he did , the National Security Agency confiscated the Neurophone . It took Pat two years of legal battle to get his invention back . <p> In using the device , you do n't  hear or see a thing ; it is applied to the skin , which Pat claims is the source of special senses . The skin contains more sensors for heat , touch , pain , vibration and electrical fields than any other part of the human anatomy . <p> In one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military audience one seminar one night and one the next night , because the size of the room was not large enough to accommodate all the attendees at one time . When the first group proved to be very cool and unwilling to respond , Patrick spent the next day making a special tape to play at the second seminar . The tape instructed the audience to be extremely warm and responsive and for their hands to become tingly . The tape was played through the Neurophone , which was connected to a wire he placed along the ceiling of the room . There were no speakers , so no sound could be heard , yet the message was successfully transmitted from that wire directly into the brains of the audience . They were warm and receptive , their hands tingled and they responded , according to programming , in other ways that Pat does n't  want publicly discussed . <p> The more we find out about how human beings work , the more we learn to control human beings . What scares me most is that the medium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your living room and bedroom may be doing a lot more than just entertaining you . <p> Before I continue , let me point out something else about an altered state of consciousness . When you go into an altered state , you transfer into right brain , which results in the internal release of brain opiates : enkephalins and Beta-endorphins , which are chemically almost identical to opium . In other words , it feels good and you want to experience more . <p> Tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that while viewers were watching TV , right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a ratio of two to one . Put more simply , the viewers were in an altered state more often than not . They were getting their Beta-endorphin fix . <p> To measure attention spans , psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford , Massachusetts , attached young viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the childrens brains produced a majority of Alpha waves . Although the children were told to concentrate , only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most viewers are already hypnotized . To deepen the trance is easy . One simple way is to place a blank , black frame every 32 frames in the film that is being projected . This creates a 45-beat-per-minute pulsation perceived only by the subconscious mind the ideal pace to generate deep hypnosis . <p> The commercials or suggestions presented following this Alpha-inducing broadcast are much more likely to be accepted by the viewer . The high percentage of the viewing audience that naturally attains a somnambulistic depth could very well accept the suggestions as commands as long as the commands did not ask the viewer to do something contrary to his morals , religion or self preservation . <p> The medium for takeover is here . By the age of 16 , children have spent 10,000 to 15,000 hours watching television more time than they spend in school . In the average home , the TV set is on for six hours and 44 minutes per day . <p> A research project by Jacob Jacoby , a Purdue University psychologist , found that of 2,700 people tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials or a TV series they watched regularly . Only minutes after watching a show , the typical viewer missed 23 to 36 percent of the questions about what they had just seen . Maybe this is because they were going in and out of trance . When in a deep trance , you must be instructed to remember otherwise you forget consciously , while your subconscious mind remembers everything . <p> I have just touched the tip of the iceberg . When you start to combine subliminal messages behind the music , subliminal visuals projected on the screen , hypnotically produced visual effects , sustained musical beats at a trance-inducing pace , you are talking conversion brainwashing . Every hour that you spend watching TV you become more conditioned . In case you thought there was a law against any of these things , guess again . There is n't . There are a lot of powerful people out there who probably have plans for you . <h> One thought on " The Battle For Your Mind By Richard Sutphen " <p> Thanks for the interesting reading . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rachel Maddows incessant and likely government fed posittion , then bumped into the brainwashing book here . I do n't  think that this work is complete , but it is a good start and i have little doubt that the media are CIA corrupted and that we are witnessing a mass media campaign to quell the spread of Democratic Socialism AKA the Bernie movement . The media was getting weird back during the Obama Admin around the primary , and I suspect he flexed his powers there so as to expose the manipulation to those in the public who are sensitive . The genie is out of the bottle , and now they are trying to get it back in again . I do n't  think its going to work .

He says he will be the " Paychecks President " as opposed to Obama the " Food Stamps President " , and claims that he created the economy that allowed Mitt Romney to get rich . <p> But nothing could be further from the truth . As a matter of fact , Gingrich is one of the Founding Fathers of modern American poverty . Not only did Gingrich vote for NAFTA , but he worked with Bill Clinton to ram GATT through Congress , thus surrendering the USAs economic sovereignty to the World Trade Organization . <p> That was in November 1994 . Now , allow Mexico , China , and India a few years to ramp-up their infrastructure , building sea ports , air ports , power grids , water systems , sweatshops , worker barracks , railroads , highways , etc . By 2000 , they were ready to accept the mass exodus of American factories and offices as ordained by Gingrich . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when the " jobless recovery " baffled the Fed , Greenspan kept his foot on the gas , no doubt chanting " free trade will create jobs " over and over , praying to his libertarian gods . But the economy couldnt respond like it had in the past , because Gingrich had relocated it to foreign lands . And all the cash that Greenspan injected to stimulate our newly hollowed-out economy blew up a giant housing bubble , destroyed our banks , and crashed our stock market again . <p> Mitt Romney says he will put an end to the dollar-yuan currency peg imposed on America by Beijing . But , he says that he will do so by petitioning Gingrichs WTO . This approach is , shall we say , effete . I can see Romney now , petitioning the WTO on bended knee : <p> " Please !

So , a potential Bullish Three Drives pattern is developing . See page 220 in The Harmonic Trader . Here is the pattern so far on the SPY 1-minute chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> So , a drop to $73.24 on Monday is a potential reversal area . The equivalent level on the SPX is 729 . Since the market is so weak , a further extension of the final thrust down might occur beyond 127% to 161.8% . Those SPY/SPX levels would be $72.80 and 724.95 . <p> In the comments on Friday , I said that the market could bounce when the Russell 2000/IWM hit its November low . And the R2K is only an eyelash above its closing low on November 20th , and its intra-day low on the 21st , right now .

I will continue studying the problem from different angles and see if I can strengthen case further . <p> The next angle is sentiment . As I mentioned in the comments on Friday , people on CNBC were euphoric over " The Amazing -199 Point Rally ' " . In fact , you can see Maria Bartiromo praising the market while it was falling at 3:45 into this interview with Robert Prechter on CNBC Friday afternoon ( sorry , CNBC took down the video ) . <p> That went on all day .

In fact , there was quite a lot of bullish cheerfulness as reflected in such indicators as the put/call ratio . So , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far because so many traders have probably already placed their bullish bets . <p> Now let 's do a gap analysis : <p> First , let 's consider that the Gap of Doom was a " continuation gap " continuing the move down from the February 2nd top .

In fact , the top of the gap is right at the 61.8% fib ( blue line and blue arrow ) and the bottom is right at the 50% mark ( green line and green arrow ) . <p> Prices snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G " on the chart ) , so it is possible that that was an exhaustion gap which may terminate the wave . Also , during the day Friday , I said in the comments that I was shorting as SPY filled the gap at point " X " . Prices usually reverse when gaps are filled , so I was just fading the gap . However , the fact that SPY was able to fill just about all of the gap is actually bullish because it ate away at most of the resistance there . So , if SPY can climb back up to the " X " , it has a good chance of being able to eventually punch through . <p> This chart shows some potential rally targets : <p> The market has two downtrend lines : The 2009 downtrend line ( upper blue ) , and the February downtrend line ( black ) . I have also made an exact parallel to the upper blue line to form a potential downtrend channel . <p> SPY may want to drop a bit more to tag the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to recapture the black line , it will likely embark upon an even steeper dive . The purple and yellow lines are potential Fibonacci resistance levels , and the blue " X " marks an ideal spot for shorting . There is triple resistance there from the blue downtrend line , the Gap of Doom , and the turquoise line , which would be a 50% retracement of the drop from February 9th . That 's about 805 for the SPX . <p> As Phil mentioned , there is a full moon on March 11th , so a rally up to the blue " X " around that time would likely bring out the same **33;183;TOOLONG that we saw at the full-moon peak on February 9th . Wouldnt that be a beautiful shorting setup ? <p> Also on the chart , notice the volume at the November low ( black circle ) , and the volume last week ( blue circle ) .

All across the nation , police are battling battalion-strength mobs of black teenagers in what I call the Urban Intifada . Here is a video of a recent incident in Chicagos Magnificent Mile shopping district : <p> There is another growing trend in the USA , seemingly unrelated to the Urban Intifada : prepping . But is it really unrelated ? I do n't  think so . Back in the 1980s , we had preppies . Remember Michael J. Fox in Family Ties ? <p> Of course , that was before all the jobs were sent out of the country , while simultaneously a massive tidal wave of legal immigrants were brought in . And the " upwardly mobile " heart was cut out of the Yuppies . <p> Today , the yuppies and preppies are long gone , and the preppers have arrived three million strong ( according to National Geographic ) . What 's a prepper ? Preppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are pretty much the exact opposite of those long-extinct preppies who believed in a bright future . By contrast , preppers believe in a hellish future for the USA . After the jobs were sent to China , Mexico , and India , many Americans watched their hometowns die , and they extrapolate their personal experience to the entire nation . Can you blame them for wanting to be prepared for the collapse of civilization ? After all , in the eyes of many Americans , the collapse is already well underway . <p> But what is the most-important thing one can have when the world does end ? Canned food ? Water ? Medicine ? Batteries ? A Flashlight ? Well , from watching National Geographics show Doomsday Preppers , it is blatantly obvious that the most-important " preps " to have are guns . Lots and lots of guns . All kinds of guns : pistols , shotguns , rifles . In fact , if you do n't  posses an arsenal in your basement , the other preppers might snicker at you behind your back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what kind of idiot does n't  prepare to mow down the desperate hordes that will be fleeing the burning cities ? That 's just common sense , right ? <p> But what about those hordes ? What kind of people will they be ? Like most TV shows , Doomsday Preppers is politically correct . The issue of race is never mentioned . When preppers discuss their plans to mow down the roving bands of looters , they never mention what race their targets might be . <p> However , preppers are well aware of the Urban Intifada , and they are aware of the mini race-war that broke out after Hurricane Katrina . That was a bonafide case of a smallish city , Baton Rouge , deploying forces to battle the thugs streaming out of New Orleans in search of new turf . ( The cities are only eighty miles apart . ) Yes , the mayor of Baton Rouge was black , but critics say that Mayor Holden roughed-up the refuges on behalf of his white constituency . <p> Baton Rouge brought in police officers from around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free hand to terrorize refugees . Said one Michigan officer : <p> " I was told that I could go ahead and beat someone down or bitch slap themI was told this was my gift from them for helping with the hurricane relief efforts . " <p> Mayor Holden said in his defense : <p> " I was not going to let Baton Rouge be overrun by some people from New Orleans who were hell-bent on committing crimes . " <p> New Orleans is only one city . What if there were simultaneous waves of refugees coming out of all of our cities ? Now , maybe you think that scenario is not plausible . But only three years after Katrina , we had another catastrophe that shook our belief in the strength of our civilization : the 2008 Financial Collapse . That crisis taught us that the ruling elite is not only corrupt , but grossly incompetent , and likely to crash the system out of sheer greed and stupidity . To them , bank deposits are not a sacred trust , but rather a source of gambling money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Greek bonds and credit-default swaps are used as chips . Not only that , but it was that same elite that miss-managed the infrastructure of New Orleans which caused the flooding in the first place . The elite then bungled the rescue operation . <p> Many preppers cite " financial collapse " as a reason for their preparations . Oh sure , they have gold coins hidden in their bunkers , but they need to guard their hoards from the inevitable waves of refugees . When Katrina struck in 2005 , there were 25.6 million people on food stamps in the USA . Today , there are nearly twice as many 47.7 million ( the majority of which are white people ) . So , the ranks of the devastated , desperate underclass have expanded dramatically since Katrina . Just imagine if the food-stamp checks , and Social-Security checks started to bounce because the federal treasury was bare . It really would be mass chaos . <p> And that is exactly what some preppers crave . They do n't  just want to have the guns and combat skills ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul is the patron saint of preppers , and they want to virtually shut down the federal government and deliberately cut off the " welfare " checks . They literally want to bring on Armageddon . For example , during the March 3 , 2013 episode of his " No Agenda " podcast , prepper Adam Curry related a conversation with a female acquaintance ( at the 1:41:51 mark ) : <p> Woman : " Do you really believe what you say on the podcast ? " Curry : " Yeah . " Woman : " Are you saying that you really want a big collapse and Armageddon because you believe it or because it sounds good for the podcast ? " Curry : " Yes . And I REALLY MEAN IT . I 'm all for paying now . Rip the Band-Aid off . Just go for it , people .

Blow their heads off ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But politically , they are on offense , willing to " starve the beast " and " let it burn . " Well , in 2008 , Ben Bernanke refused to let it burn , and that 's why he has become the focus of prepper hatred . Bernanke got between the preppers and their precious Armageddon by not letting the banking system collapse . <p> Not only do libertarians want to start Armageddon , but they have been its primary architects . The open-border policy that let the factories leave , and allowed the tidal-wave of immigrants to come in , is a libertarian policy . And libertarians are , of course , just the useful idiots of David Rockefellers Neoliberalism . <p> A few weeks ago , " immigrant " riots were raging in Stockholm . When was the last time you heard about riots in the " socialist " Nordic countries ? Probably never , right ? However , the Swedes have turned away from socialism and have adopted an Anglo-style neoliberal system . That 's why they brought in immigrants when they had no jobs for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the massive London riot of 2011 , and Americas Urban Intifada and Occupy Wall Street . <p> You see , these riots are a design feature of Neoliberalism . Corporate profits are maximized by crushing wages , and the best way to do that is with a large surplus of workers what Karl Marx called The Reserve Army of Labor . The riots themselves are not desired per se , however they can be considered a design feature of the system because , by definition , members of The Reserve Army of Labor never have jobs . Rather , their " job " is to remind workers that they can be replaced just like that . Their mere presence intimidates workers and keeps them docile , and accepting of harsh conditions and low wages . <p> The twin pincers of offshoring , and mass immigration drive both the prepper movement and the Urban Intifada on a potential collision course . And those pincers will not be stopped because they are official economic policy . That 's how the Oligarchy wants it . That 's how the multinationals make record profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preppers are right ; the USA does indeed have a hellish future in store . <p> Perhaps the woman in the video above , the one who complained about her $17,000 property taxes is a fashion designer .

If so , she is typical of the ruling elite . Now she is outraged that she is harassed when she tries to spend her globalization profits on Magnificent Mile . When will the Oligarchy learn that taking peoples jobs away is n't exactly a recipe for social harmony ? <p> Of course , the solution is simple : give the people their jobs back . Put an emergency moratorium on immigration , slap tariffs on cheap imports , bring the factories home . But do n't  hold your breath .

On numerous occasions , the information has helped to bring public attention to the misuse of conversion tactics . <p> Some government agencies do n't  want this information generally known , for the techniques are used in armed forces basic training . Some Christian Fundamentalists , cults , and human-potential trainings would also prefer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . <p> I 'm going to talk about conversion , which is a nice word for brainwashing . Everything Ill share only exposes the surface of the problem . I do n't  know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped other than through public awareness . It is n't possible to legislate against what often can not be detected ; and if those who legislate are using these techniques , there is little hope of affecting laws to govern usage . <p> In talking about mind manipulation , I am talking about my own business . I know it , and I know how effective it can be . I produce hypnosis and subliminal tapes and , in some of my seminars , I use conversion tactics to assist participants to become independent and self-sufficient . But , any time I use these techniques , I point out that I am using them , and those attending have a choice to participate or not . They 're also aware of the desired result of participation . <p> So , to begin , I want to share a basic fact about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE HAS EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED AND REALIZED , OR BELIEVED , THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED . Those who have been brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators , claiming they have simply been " shown the light " or have been transformed in miraculous ways . <p> Any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in eighteenth century America . Apparently , Jonathan Edwards accidentally discovered the techniques during a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton , Massachusetts . By inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension , the sinners attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit . Technically , what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming . He would tell those attending , " You 're a sinner ! Youre destined for hell ! " <p> As a result , one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide . The neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they , too , were affected so deeply that , although they had found " eternal salvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lives . <p> Once a preacher , cult leader , manipulator or authority figure creates the brain phrase to wipe the brain-slate clean , his subjects are open to new programming . New input , in the form of suggestions , can be substituted for their previous ideas . Because Edwards did n't  turn his message positive until the end of the revival , many accepted the negative suggestions and acted , or desired to act , upon them . <p> Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York . The techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists , cults , human-potential training , some business rallies , and the U.S. armed services . <p> Let me point out here that I do n't  think most revivalist preachers realize or know they are using brainwashing techniques . Edwards simply stumbled upon a technique that worked , and others copied it and have continued to copy it for over two hundred years . And the more sophisticated our knowledge and technology become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the major reasons for the increasing rise in Christian fundamentalism , especially the televised variety , while most of the orthodox religions are declining . <p> The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate brainwashing , but we have to look to Pavlov , the Russian scientist , for a technical explanation . In the early 1900s , his work with animals opened the door to further investigations with humans . After the revolution in Russia , Lenin was quick to see the potential of applying Pavlovs research to his own ends . <p> Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were identified by Pavlov . The first is the Equivalent phase , in which the brain gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli . Second is the Paradoxical phase , in which the brain responds more actively to weak stimuli than to strong . Third is the Ultra-Paradoxical phase , in which conditioned responses and behavior patterns turn from positive to negative or from negative to positive . <p> With the progressions through each phase , the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve conversion are many and varied , but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual or group until they reach an abnormal level of anger , fear , excitement or nervous tension . <p> The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgment and increase suggestibility . The more this condition can be maintained or intensified , the more it compounds . Once catharsis or the first brain phase is reached , the complete mental takeover becomes easier . Existing mental programming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and behavior . <p> Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain functions are fasting , radical or high sugar diets , physical discomforts , regulation of breathing , mantra chanting in meditation , the disclosure of awesome mysteries , special lighting and sound effects , programmed response to incense , or intoxicating drugs . <p> The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment by electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a patients blood sugar level with insulin injections . <p> Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two distinctly different things and that conversion techniques are far more powerful . However , the two are often mixedwith powerful results . <p> If you 'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work , there are probably several in your city . Go to the church or tent early and sit in the rear , about three-quarters of the way back . Most likely repetitive music will be played while the people come in for the service . A repetitive beat , ideally ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute ( a rhythm close to the beat of a human heart ) is very hypnotic and can generate an eyes-open altered state of consciousness in a high percentage of people . And , once you are in an Alpha state , you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in full Beta consciousness . The music is probably the same for every service , or incorporates the same beat , and many of the people will go into an altered state almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state of mind from previous services and respond according to the post-hypnotic programming . <p> Watch the people waiting for the service to begin . Many will exhibit external signs of trance body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes . Often , they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air while sitting in their chairs . Next , the assistant pastor will come out . He usually speaks with a " voice roll . " <p> A " voice roll " is a patterned , paced style used by hypnotists when inducing a trance . It is also used by many lawyers ( several of the most famous are highly trained hypnotists ) when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors . A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome , or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous , patterned style . The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 35 to 60 beats per minute , maximizing the hypnotic effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . He induces an altered state of consciousness and/or begins to generate the excitement and the expectations of the audience . Next , a group of young women in " sweet and pure " chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song . Gospel songs are great for building excitement and involvement . In the middle of the song , one of the girls might be " smitten by the Spirit " and fall down or react as if possessed by the Holy Spirit . This effectively increases the intense atmosphere in the room . At this point , hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed . And the result is the audiences attention is now totally focused upon the communication while the environment becomes more exciting or tense . <p> Right about this time , when an eyes-open mass-induced Alpha mental level has been achieved , they will usually pass the collection plate . In the background , a 45-beat-per-minute voice roll from the assistant preacher might exhort , " Give to GodGive to GodGive to God " And the audience does give . God may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Next , the fire-and-brimstone preacher will come out . He induces fear and increases the tension by talking about " the devil " , " going to hell " or the forthcoming Armageddon . <p> In the last such rally I attended , the preacher talked about the blood that would soon be running out of every faucet in the land . He was also obsessed with a " bloody ax of God , " which attendees had seen hanging above the pulpit the previous week . I have no doubt that some people saw it the power of suggestion given to a group of people in hypnosis assures that at least 10 to 25 percent would see whatever he suggested they see . <p> In most revivalist gatherings , " testifying " or " witnessing " usually follows the fear-based sermon . People from the audience come up on stage and relate their stories . " I was crippled and now I can walk ! " " I had arthritis and now its gone ! " It is a psychological manipulation that works . After listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the audience with a minor problem is sure he can be healed . The room is charged with fear , guilt , intense excitement and expectations . <p> Now those who want to be healed are frequently lined up around the edge of the room , or they are told to come down to the front . The preacher might touch them on the head firmly and scream , " Be healed ! " This releases the psychic energy and , for many , catharsis results . Catharsis is a purging of repressed emotions . Individuals might cry , fall down or even go into spasms . And if catharsis is effected , they stand a chance of being healed . In catharsis , the brain-slate is temporarily wiped clean and the new suggestion is accepted . <p> For some , the healing may be permanent . For many , it will last four days to a week a week is , incidentally , how long a hypnotic suggestion given to a somnambulistic subject will usually last . Even if the healing does n't  last , if they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problemor sometimes , sadly , it can mask a physical problem which could prove to be very detrimental to the individual in the long run . <p> I 'm not saying that legitimate healings do not take place . They do . Maybe the individual was ready to let go of the negativity that caused the problem in the first place ; maybe it was the work of God . Yet I contend that it can be explained with existing knowledge of brain/mind function . <p> The techniques and staging will vary from church to church . Many use " speaking in tongues " to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in the observers . <p> The use of hypnotic and conversion techniques by religions is sophisticated , and professionals are assuring that they become evermore effective . A man in Los Angeles is designing , building and reworking a lot of churches around the county . He tells ministers what they need and how to use it . This mans track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income will double if the minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting . <p> Powerful sound and the proper use of lighting are of primary importance in inducing an altered state of consciousness Ive been using them for years in my own seminars . However , my participants are fully aware of the process and what they can expect as a result of their participation . <p> Cults and human-potential training companies are always looking for new converts . To attain them , many use conversion tactics , which must be effective within a short space of time usually a weekend , but in some cases as quickly as a single day . The following are the six primary techniques used to generate the conversion . <p> Conversion Tactic 1 : The meetings or training takes place in an area where participants are cut off from the outside world : a private home , a remote or rural setting , or a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed only limited bathroom usage . In human-potential trainings , the controllers will give a lengthy talk about the importance of " keeping agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't  keep your agreements , your life will never work . " Generally , this is good advice , but the controllers are subverting a positive human value for selfish purposes . The participants vow to themselves and their trainer that they will keep their agreements . Anyone who does n't concur will be intimidated into agreement or forced to leave the training . The next step is to get the participants to agree to complete the training , thus assuring a high percentage of conversions for the organization . They will usually have to agree not to take drugs , smoke and sometimes not to eator they are given such a short meal break that it creates tension . One of the real reasons for the agreements is to alter internal chemistry , which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a slight malfunction of the nervous system , which in turn increases the conversion potential . <p> Before the gathering is complete , the agreements manipulation will be used to ensure that the new converts go out and find new participants . They are intimidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the importance of keeping agreements is so high on their priority list , the converts will twist the arms of everyone they know , attempting to talk them into attending the free introductory session offered at a future date by the training organization . The new converts are zealots . The inside term for merchandising one of the largest and most successful human-potential trainings is , " sell it by zealot ! " <p> At least a million people are graduates and a good percentage have been left with a mental activation button that assures their future loyalty and assistance if the guru figure or organization calls . Think about the potential political implications of hundreds of thousands of zealots programmed to campaign for their guru . <p> Be wary of an organization of this type that offers follow-up sessions after the seminar . Follow-up sessions might be weekly meetings or inexpensive seminars given on a regular basis which the organization will attempt to talk you into taking . These regularly scheduled events are used to maintain control . As the early Christian revivalists found , long-term control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tactic 2 : A schedule is maintained that causes physical and mental fatigue . This is primarily accomplished by long hours in which the participants are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection . <p> Conversion Tactic 3 : Techniques are used to increase the tension in the room or environment . <p> Conversion Tactic 4 : Uncertainty . One of the most effective ways of creating uncertainty is to subject the participants to the fear of being " put on the spot " or encountered by the trainers who play upon guilt feelings , or convince the participants to verbally relate their innermost secrets in front of the others . Activities that emphasize the removal of masks is another powerful ploy . One of the most successful human-potential seminars forces the participants to stand on a stage in front of the entire audience while being verbally attacked by the trainers . A public poll showed that the most fearful of all situations is to speak to an audience . It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office building . So you can imagine the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed to complete the training . Many faint , but most cope with the stress by mentally going away . They literally go into an Alpha state , which automatically opens them to being 25 to 200 times more suggestible . And another loop of the downward spiral into conversion is successfully effected . <p> Conversion Tactic 5 : The introduction of jargon new terms that have meaning only to the " insiders " who have participated in the training . Vicious language is also frequently used to purposely make participants uncomfortable . <p> Conversion Tactic 6 : There is no humor in the communications until the participants are converted . Then , merry-making and humor are highly desirable as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly " found . " <p> I 'm not saying that good does not result from participation in such gatherings . But it is important for people to know what has happened and to be aware that continual involvement may not be in their best interest . <p> Over the years , I 've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be hypnotists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who conduct human-potential training and rallies ( from the training companies who use the tactics I 've just described ) come to me and say , " I know what I 'm doing works , but I do n't  know why . " After showing them how and why , many have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner . <p> Many of these trainers have become personal friends , and it scares us all to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full of people . Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of conversion . The sad truth is that a high percentage of people seem to want to become true believers and give away their power . <p> Cult gatherings or human-potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe firsthand what is technically called the " Stockholm Syndrome . " This is a situation in which those who are intimidated , controlled or made to suffer , begin to love , admire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let me inject a word of warning here : If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected , you are probably wrong . A perfect example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Haitian Voodoo . In her report , she related how the music eventually induced uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness . Although she understood the process and thought herself above it , when she began to feel herself become vulnerable to the music , she attempted to fight it and turned away . Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion . A few moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance around the Voodoo meeting house . A brain phase had been induced by the music and excitement , and she awoke feeling reborn . The only hope of attending such gatherings without being affected is to be the Buddha and allow no positive or negative emotions to surface . Few people are capable of such detachment . <p> I once attended EST ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , although a current incarnation of the seminar is called The Forum . My goal in attending was to be an observer to be Buddha throughout the process , which took place in a Phoenix hotel ballroom with 200 people attending . I remained detached until late afternoon of the final day , when a doctor stood up and accused the EST trainer of using brainwashing tactics . The incensed trainer argued back , using ridiculous Zen riddles to try to intimidate the doctor . <p> After 45 minutes of ranting , the trainer began using the other participants against the protesting doctor , who was speaking the truth . That did it . I stood up , snapped a karate kick at an EST staffer and took a spare microphone out of his hands ( the kick was to distract and did not inflict pain ) . Then I verbally went after the trainer . He responded by yelling for his people to call the police . Both the doctor and I walked out of the training room as the police arrived . I 'm probably still listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before leaving the six conversion tactics , I should mention military boot camp . The Marine Corps talks about breaking men down before rebuilding them as new men as marines . That is exactly what they do , the same way a cult breaks its people down and rebuilds them as happy flower sellers on your local street corner . Every one of the six conversion techniques are used in boot camp . Considering the needs of the military , I 'm not making a judgment as to whether this is good or bad . As a simple fact , these men are brainwashed . Those who wont submit must be discharged or spend much of their time in the brig . <p> Once the initial conversion is effected , cults , armed services , and similar groups can not have cynicism among their members . Members must respond to commands and do as they are told , otherwise , they are dangerous to the organizational control . This is normally accomplished as a three-step Decognition Process . <p> Step One is Alertness Reduction : The controllers cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fantasy and reality . This can be accomplished in several always . Poor diet is one ; watch out for brownies and Kool-Aid . The sugar throws the nervous system off . More subtle is the " spiritual diet " used by many cults . They eat only vegetables and fruits ; without the grounding of grains , nuts , seeds , dairy products , fish , or meat , an individual becomes mentally spacey . Inadequate sleep is another primary way to reduce alertness , especially when combined with long hours of work or intense physical activity . Being bombarded with intense and unique experiences achieves the same result . <p> Step Two is Programmed Confusion : You are mentally assaulted while your alertness is being reduced as in Step One . This is accomplished with a deluge of new information , lectures , discussion groups , encounters or one-to-one processing , which usually amounts to the controller bombarding the individual with questions . During this phase of decognition , reality and illusion often merge and perverted logic is likely to be accepted . <p> Step Three is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go flat **30;218;TOOLONG techniques that initially induce calmness by giving the mind something simple to deal with that focuses awareness . The continued use brings on a feeling of elation and eventually hallucination . The result is the reduction of thought and eventually , if used long enough , the cessation of all thought and withdrawal from everyone and everything except that which the controllers direct . The mental takeover is then complete . It is important to be aware that when members or participants are instructed to use thought-stopping techniques , they are told that they will benefit by so doing : they will become better soldiers or attain enlightenment . <p> There are three primary techniques used for thought stopping . The first is Marching : The thump , thump , thump beat literally generates self-hypnosis and thus greater susceptibility to suggestion . In the early stages of his rise to power , Adolph Hitler used marching demonstrations and the excitement as a mass conversion technique for those attending his rallies , and in the decognition phase for his soldiers . <p> The second thought-stopping technique is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in meditation , after a few weeks , there is high probability that you will not return to full Beta consciousness . You will remain in a fixed state of Alpha for as long as you continue to meditate . I 'm not saying this is bad . If you do it yourself , it may be very beneficial . But know that you are causing your mind to go flat . I 've worked with meditators on an EEG machine and the results are conclusive : the more you meditate , the flatter your mind becomes until , eventually and especially if used to excess or in combination with decognition , all thought ceases . Some spiritual groups call this nirvana which is just another manipulation . The mental state is simply a predictable physiological result . If heaven on earth is non-thinking and non-involvement , I really question why we are here . <p> The third thought-stopping technique is Chanting , and often chanting in meditation . Speaking in tongues could also be included in this category . <p> All three thought-stopping techniques produce an altered state of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , for you also control the input . I personally use at least one self-hypnosis programming session every day and I know how beneficial it is for me . But you need to know if you use these techniques to the degree of remaining continually in Alpha that , although you 'll be very mellow , you 'll also be more suggestible . <p> Before ending this section , I want to talk about the people who are most susceptible to conversion and joining mass movements . I am convinced that at least a third of the population are what Eric Hoffer calls true believers . They are joiners and followerspeople who want to give away their power . They look for answers , meaning and enlightenment outside themselves . <p> Hoffers book The True Believer ( Harper &amp; Row , 1951 ) is a classic on mass movements . He says , " True believers are not intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self , but are those craving to be rid of an unwanted self . They are followers , not because of a desire for self-advancement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hoffer also says that true believers " are eternally incomplete and eternally insecure . " <p> In my years of conducting seminar trainings , I have constantly run into true believers . All I can do is advise them to seek the True Self within , where meaningful personal answers will be found . I teach that the basics of spirituality are self-responsibility ( karma ) and the attainment of self-actualization ( being compassionate , while also accepting others without judgment , expectations , blame or attempting to control . ) But most of the true believers just tell me that I 'm not spiritual and go looking for someone who will give them the dogma and structure they desire . <p> Never underestimate the potential danger of these people . They can easily be molded into fanatics who will gladly work and die for their holy cause . It is a substitute for their lost faith in themselves and offers a substitute for individual hope . Hitlers Brown Shirts were true believers . The Moral Majority is made up of true believers . All cults are composed of true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses and social-cause groups . They are the fanatics in these organizations . <p> Mass Movements will usually have a charismatic leader . The followers want to convert others to their way of living or impose a new way of life if necessary , by legislating laws forcing others to their view , as evidenced by the activities of the Moral Majority . This means enforcement by guns or punishment , which is the bottom line in law enforcement . <p> A common hatred , enemy , or devil is essential to the success of a mass movement . Hitlers devil was the Jews ; the Born-Again Christians have Satan himself , but that is n't enough they 've added the New Age and all who oppose their integration of church and politics , as evidenced in the political reelection campaigns against those who oppose their views . In revolutions , the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy . Some human-potential movements are far too clever to ask their graduates to join anything , thus labeling themselves a cult but , upon close examination , you 'll find that their devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are mass movements without devils but they seldom attain major status . True believers are mentally unbalanced or insecure people , or those without hope or friends . People do n't  look for allies when they love , but they do when they hate or become obsessed with a cause . And those who desire a new life and a new order feel the old ways must be eliminated before the new order can be built . <p> Persuasion is n't technically brainwashing , but it is a manipulation of the human mind , without the manipulated party being aware what caused his opinion shift . I only have time to very basically introduce you to a few of the many techniques in use today , but the basis of persuasion is always to access your right brain . The left half of your brain is analytical and rational . The right half is creative and imaginative . That is overly simplified but it makes my point . So , the idea is to distract the left brain and keep it busy . Ideally , the persuader generates an eyes-open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beta awareness into Alpha a shift that can be measured on an EEG machine . <p> First , let me give you an example of distracting the left brain . Politicians use these powerful techniques all the time ; lawyers use many variations which , I 've been told , they call tightening the noose . <p> Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech . First , he might generate what is called a yes set . These are statements that will cause most listeners to agree ; they might even unknowingly nod their heads in agreement . Next come the truisms . These are usually facts that could be debated but , once the politician has his audience agreeing , the odds are in the politicians favor that the audience wont stop to think for themselves , thus continuing to agree . Last comes the suggestion . This is what the politician wants you to do and , since you 've been agreeing all along , you could be persuaded to accept the suggestion . Now , if you 'll listen closely to my political speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes set , the next three are truisms and the last is the suggestion . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen : are you angry about high food prices ? Are you tired of astronomical gas prices ? Are you sick of out-of-control inflation ? Well , you know the Other Party allowed 18 percent inflation last year ; you know crime has increased 50 percent nationwide in the last 12 months , and you know your paycheck hardly covers your expenses any more . Well , the answer to resolving these problems is to elect me , John Jones , to the U.S. Senate . " <p> Youve heard it all before . But you might also watch for what are called Imbedded Commands . As an example : On key words , the speaker makes a gesture with his left hand , which research has shown is more apt to access your right brain . Todays media oriented politicians and spellbinders are often carefully trained by a whole new breed of specialists who are using every trick in the book both old and new to manipulate you into accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so heavily protected that I found out the hard way that to even talk about them publicly or in print results in threatened legal action . Yet Neurolinguistics training is readily available to anyone willing to devote the time and pay the price . It is some of the most subtle and powerful manipulation Ive ever seen . A good friend who recently attended a two-week seminar on Neurolinguistics found that many of those she talked to during the breaks were government people . <p> Another slippery manipulation is called an interspersal technique and the idea is to say one thing with words but plant a subconscious impression of something else in the minds of the listeners and viewers . <p> As an example , assume you are watching a television commentator make the following statement : " Senator Johnson is assisting local authorities to clear up the stupid mistakes of the companies contributing to the nuclear waste problems . " It sounds like a statement of fact , but if the speaker emphasizes the right word and especially if he makes the proper hand gestures on the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Senator Johnson is stupid . That was the subliminal goal of the statement and the speaker can not be sued for libel . <p> Persuasion techniques are also frequently used on a much smaller scale with just as much effectiveness . The insurance salesman knows his pitch is likely to be more effective if he can get you to visualize something in your mind . This is right-brain communication . For instance , he might pause in his conversation , look slowly around your living room and say , " Can you just imagine this beautiful home burning to the ground ? " Of course you can ! It is one of your unconscious fears and in forcing you to visualize it , you are more likely to be manipulated into signing his insurance policy . <p> The cults , operating in every airport , use what I call shock and confusion techniques to distract the left brain and communicate directly with the right brain . While waiting for a plane , I once watched one operate for over an hour . He had a technique of almost jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud then dropped as he made his pitch to take a book and contribute money to the cause . Usually , when people are shocked , they immediately withdraw . In this case they were shocked by the strange appearance , sudden materialization and loud voice of the devotee . In other words , the people went into an Alpha state for security because they did n't  want to confront the reality before them . In Alpha , they were highly suggestible so they responded to the suggestion of taking the book ; the moment they took the book , they felt guilty and responded to the second suggestion : give money . We are all conditioned that if someone gives us something , we have to give them something in return . While watching this hustler , I was close enough to notice that many of the people he stopped exhibited an outward sign of Alpha their eyes dilated . <p> Subliminals are hidden suggestions , perceived only by your subconscious mind . They can be audio suggestions , hidden behind music , or visual suggestions airbrushed or cleverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a screen so fast that you do n't  consciously see them . <p> Some subliminal programming tapes offer verbal suggestions recorded at a low volume . I question the efficacy of this technique if subliminals are not perceptible , they can not be effective , and subliminals recorded below the audible threshold are therefore useless . The oldest audio subliminal technique uses a voice that follows the volume of the music so subliminals are impossible to detect without a parametric equalizer . But this technique is patented and , when I wanted to develop my own line of subliminal audio cassettes , negotiations with the patent holder proved to be unsatisfactory . My attorney obtained copies of the patents which I gave to talented Hollywood sound engineers , asking them to create a new technique . They found a way to psycho-acoustically modify and synthesize the suggestions so that they are projected in the same chord and frequency as the music , thus giving them the effect of being part of the music . But we found that in using this technique , there is no way to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the suggestions are being heard by the subconscious mind , they can not be monitored with even the most sophisticated equipment . <p> If we were able to come up with this technique as easily as we did , I can only imagine how sophisticated the technology has become , with government or advertising funding . And I shudder to think about the propaganda and commercial manipulation that we are exposed to on a daily basis . There is simply no way to know what is behind the music you hear . It may even be possible to hide a second voice behind the voice to which you are listening . <p> The series of books by Bryan Key , Ph.D . on subliminals in advertising and political campaigns , well documents the misuse in many areas , especially printed advertising in newspapers , magazines and posters . <p> The big question about subliminals is : do they work ? Based upon the response from those who have used my tapes , the answer is yes . Subliminal suggestions behind the music in department stores can be advising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain reported a 37 percent reduction in thefts in the first nine months of testing . <p> A 1984 article in the technical newsletter Brain-Mind Bulletin states that as much as 99 percent of our cognitive activity may be non-conscious , according to the director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at the University of Illinois . The lengthy report ends with the statement , " these findings support the use of subliminal approaches such as taped suggestions for weight loss and the therapeutic use of hypnosis and Neuro-linguistic programming . " <p> I could relate many stories that support subliminal programming , but I 'd rather use my time to make you aware of even more subtle uses of such programming . <p> I have personally experienced sitting in a Los Angeles auditorium with over ten thousand people who were gathered to listen to a charismatic figure . Twenty minutes after entering the auditorium , I became aware that I was going in and out of an altered state . Those accompanying me experienced the same thing . Since it is our business , we were aware of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful observation , what appeared to be spontaneous demonstrations were , in fact , artful manipulations . The only way I could figure how the eyes-open trance had been induced was to pipe a 6- to 7-cycle-per-second vibration into the room behind the air conditioner sound . That vibration generates Alpha , which would render the audience highly susceptible . Ten to 25 percent of the population is capable of a somnambulistic trance level . For these people , the suggestions of the speaker could potentially be accepted as commands . <p> Vibrato is the tremulous effect imparted in some vocal or instrumental music , and the cycle-per-second range causes people to go into an altered state of consciousness . At one period of English history , singers whose voices contained pronounced vibrato were not allowed to perform publicly because listeners would go into an altered state and have fantasies , often sexual in nature . <p> People who attend opera or enjoy listening to singers like Mario Lanza are familiar with this altered state induced by the performers . <p> Now , let 's carry this awareness a little farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . These are electromagnetic in nature . One of the primary uses of ELFs is to communicate with our submarines . Dr. Andrija Puharich , a highly respected researcher , in an attempt to warn U.S. officials about Russian use of ELFs , set up an experiment . Volunteers were wired so their brain waves could be measured on an EEG . They were then sealed in a metal room that could not be penetrated by a normal signal . <p> Puharich then beamed ELF waves at the volunteers . ELFs go right through the earth and right through metal walls . Those inside couldnt know if the signal was or was not being sent . And Puharich watched the reactions on the technical equipment : Thirty percent of those inside the room were taken over by the ELF signal in six to ten seconds . <p> When I say taken over , I mean their behavior followed the changes anticipated at very precise frequencies . Waves below 6 cycles per second caused the subjects to become emotionally upset , and even disrupted bodily functions . At 8.2 cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterful meditation , learned over a period of years . Eleven to 11.3 cycles induced waves of depressed agitation which could lead to riotous behavior . <p> Dr. Patrick Flanagan is a personal friend . In the early 1960s , as a teenager , Pat was listed as one of the top scientists in the world by Life magazine . Among his many inventions was a device he called the Neurophone an electronic instrument that can successfully program suggestions directly through contact with the skin . When he attempted to patent the device , the government demanded that he prove it worked . When he did , the National Security Agency confiscated the Neurophone . It took Pat two years of legal battle to get his invention back . <p> In using the device , you do n't  hear or see a thing ; it is applied to the skin , which Pat claims is the source of special senses . The skin contains more sensors for heat , touch , pain , vibration and electrical fields than any other part of the human anatomy . <p> In one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military audience one seminar one night and one the next night , because the size of the room was not large enough to accommodate all the attendees at one time . When the first group proved to be very cool and unwilling to respond , Patrick spent the next day making a special tape to play at the second seminar . The tape instructed the audience to be extremely warm and responsive and for their hands to become tingly . The tape was played through the Neurophone , which was connected to a wire he placed along the ceiling of the room . There were no speakers , so no sound could be heard , yet the message was successfully transmitted from that wire directly into the brains of the audience . They were warm and receptive , their hands tingled and they responded , according to programming , in other ways that Pat does n't  want publicly discussed . <p> The more we find out about how human beings work , the more we learn to control human beings . What scares me most is that the medium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your living room and bedroom may be doing a lot more than just entertaining you . <p> Before I continue , let me point out something else about an altered state of consciousness . When you go into an altered state , you transfer into right brain , which results in the internal release of brain opiates : enkephalins and Beta-endorphins , which are chemically almost identical to opium . In other words , it feels good and you want to experience more . <p> Tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that while viewers were watching TV , right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a ratio of two to one . Put more simply , the viewers were in an altered state more often than not . They were getting their Beta-endorphin fix . <p> To measure attention spans , psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford , Massachusetts , attached young viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the childrens brains produced a majority of Alpha waves . Although the children were told to concentrate , only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most viewers are already hypnotized . To deepen the trance is easy . One simple way is to place a blank , black frame every 32 frames in the film that is being projected . This creates a 45-beat-per-minute pulsation perceived only by the subconscious mind the ideal pace to generate deep hypnosis . <p> The commercials or suggestions presented following this Alpha-inducing broadcast are much more likely to be accepted by the viewer . The high percentage of the viewing audience that naturally attains a somnambulistic depth could very well accept the suggestions as commands as long as the commands did not ask the viewer to do something contrary to his morals , religion or self preservation . <p> The medium for takeover is here . By the age of 16 , children have spent 10,000 to 15,000 hours watching television more time than they spend in school . In the average home , the TV set is on for six hours and 44 minutes per day . <p> A research project by Jacob Jacoby , a Purdue University psychologist , found that of 2,700 people tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials or a TV series they watched regularly . Only minutes after watching a show , the typical viewer missed 23 to 36 percent of the questions about what they had just seen . Maybe this is because they were going in and out of trance . When in a deep trance , you must be instructed to remember otherwise you forget consciously , while your subconscious mind remembers everything . <p> I have just touched the tip of the iceberg . When you start to combine subliminal messages behind the music , subliminal visuals projected on the screen , hypnotically produced visual effects , sustained musical beats at a trance-inducing pace , you are talking conversion brainwashing . Every hour that you spend watching TV you become more conditioned . In case you thought there was a law against any of these things , guess again . There is n't . There are a lot of powerful people out there who probably have plans for you . <h> One thought on " The Battle For Your Mind By Richard Sutphen " <p> Thanks for the interesting reading . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rachel Maddows incessant and likely government fed posittion , then bumped into the brainwashing book here . I do n't  think that this work is complete , but it is a good start and i have little doubt that the media are CIA corrupted and that we are witnessing a mass media campaign to quell the spread of Democratic Socialism AKA the Bernie movement . The media was getting weird back during the Obama Admin around the primary , and I suspect he flexed his powers there so as to expose the manipulation to those in the public who are sensitive . The genie is out of the bottle , and now they are trying to get it back in again . I do n't  think its going to work .

Here is the equity-curve chart for the week ( click to enlarge ) : <p> And here are the daily totals : <p> As you can see , Monday and Tuesday were a disaster . There are two reason for that . First , both days were " reversal days " where prices glided down in the morning , and glided back up in the afternoon . Those are the worst days for Ziggy . Fortunately , they only occur once a month or so , but I had the bad luck of getting hit with two of them to start the week . <p> The second reason for the losses was slippage . My initial tests showed that Ziggy could do OK with market orders , but it turns out that that was a wrong conclusion . Ziggy got nickled-and-dimed to death with bad fills on Monday and Tuesday to the tune of about $300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for limit orders , which is a big deal because it complicates the programs logic .

As you can see on the " 7/29/2009 7/31/2009 " line of the table above , Ziggy v2.00 made $979 from Wednesday to Friday , with a 60% batting average . <p> Wednesday was the big day . That was the type of day that I had in mind when I first started working on the program . The SPX barely moved , but the intra-day action was wonderfully volatile . Watching Ziggy on Wednesday was like watching a John Deere combine harvesting the crop . <p> So , even though the week started out with an industrial accident , I 'm very happy with how it finished up . Its not easy to watch your computer makes trades . It requires a lot of discipline to resist the urge to " help " it . I only did that three times over the entire week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $100 or so . <p> Its a funny thing ; while I have coded my trading rules into software , the software is a much better trader than I am . Ziggy always follows its trading rules , it trades without emotion , like a robot , and it has perfect concentration . The latter is very important for scalping , which is sort of like driving a race car : if you doze off for just a few seconds , you might crash and burn . <p> Ziggy can make enough money to pay for its own electricity now , so its earning its keep . If it can prove itself over the next couple of weeks by building up enough equity , I will let it trade two contracts . At that point , I can start working on code that scales into , and out of , positions to get better average prices .

Then it constantly badgers it ; asking : " What time is it ? " over and over . Once it has the current time of the song playing , it looks in the song track to see what it should be doing at that moment . <p> If there is a 3 in the Beat column , then the program will turn the 3 red on The Count window , and make sure that all the other numbers are black . If there is some text in the Note column , it will show it next to the 3 . If there is some text in the advice column , it will show it in the Advice section at the bottom of The Count window . <p> So , every beat of the song must be scripted . And while that is several hundred beats to worry about , in practice , most of them are handled automatically . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for the program to automatically calculate where each beat is . Its when the music speeds up , slows down , shifts , or skips beats that you have to go to work . <p> When you first add a song on the Setup Songs window , there will be no song-track data . When you then click the " Edit Song Track " button , the program will open up the " New Track " window . On that window , the program instructs you to use the " Measure a Song " window to figure out how fast it is . <p> Once you have measured the song , filled in the length , and clicked the " Make Track " button on the " New Track " window , the Song Track window will open up with a blank song track . Now you will want to play the song to see how well it matches up . If there is some silence at the beginning of the song , you will need to shift the song track forward so that it will start playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are working on Windows , you will want to use QuickTime instead of Windows Media Player . Go onto the " File " menu , and then to " Settings " and read what it says there . QuickTime comes with iTunes , so you can install it by following the instructions on this page . <p> Count this number is automatically filled in when the program makes a new track . It is n't used for anything important , so if you need to delete counts in the middle of the song , you do n't  need to worry about a gap in the numbers . <p> Time this is the most important number since The Count window uses it to synchronize with the song . You can type over this number , but normally the program will calculate it for you . <p> Interval this is the number of seconds between each count . <p> Speed this is the speed of the song in beats-per-minute . The program uses this number to figure out what the interval is . The interval is then added to the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . <p> You can type over the interval and the speed , but normally the program will figure out the interval for you . If the program thinks you have made a mistake , and there is too much , or too little , time between two of your counts , it will turn the interval red . <p> Beat this is the number on The Count window that will be turned red at the time of the count . You can type over this also , but normally the program will calculate it for you . <p> Comment in this column you can type notes to yourself . For example , if you think the song is speeding up , you can type : " going faster here ? " The program does not show these comments anywhere else . <p> Note and Advice were discussed above , however , make your notes short enough to fit into the space next to the numbers on The Count window . And once you have typed in some advice , you will usually want it to be erased when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " clear " for the advice without the quotes and in all lower case . For example , if on an earlier count , you typed in " listen to the piano as it keeps the rhythm " , you may want to type in " clear " on the count where the piano stops . Or you could type in some new advice . <p> Shift Counts use this to shift counts forward or backward . It will change the time of each of the counts you have selected . You can use fractions , and you can shift the entire track if you want . <p> Selecting Multiple Lines since clicking in a " cell " of the list will usually put the cursor there , if you want to select multiple lines , click-and-drag in the Count column . You can also shift-click and control-click to select multiple lines . <p> To edit a cell click once to select the line , and then click again to get a cursor in the cell . <p> Navigating With the Keyboard once you have clicked into a cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move up and down the column . You can use the tab key to go to the next column and shift-tab to go to the previous column . The program saves things as you go , so there is no Save button to click . <p> Add Counts and Delete Counts use these controls to add or remove counts . The program will only allow you to add counts where there is a gap , or at the end of the song . Be careful when deleting because you can not undo it . <p> Change Speed this will use the number you enter for speed to re-calculate the time of each count you have selected in the list . For example , many songs start off slow and then speed up . So , suppose you have your initial track set to run at 180 . Then as you watch it playing , you see the numbers on The Count window lagging behind . Click the stop button and then try to zero-in on where the song sped up . Once you have the spot , select all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess the new speed is . After a while , you will get pretty good at guessing this . Normally , you will be working from the beginning of the song and going forward , so even though you do n't  know the speed of the song later on , you will probably still want to shift the rest of the track forward and then let it play again to see if it stays in sync . You can change the speed of only one section in the middle of the song ; just make sure to look at what happens on the count following that section since you will probably have a count that is too close or too far away from the last one you changed . <p> Reduce Beats this simply subtracts one from the beat of each count you have selected . There is no " increase beats " control because if you keep clicking the button , it will wrap around . So , when a 1 beat is reduced , it becomes an 8 instead of a 0 . Use this when the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 1 instead of continuing on to the 5 , etc . If you think it is easier to follow a song by ignoring the 5-to-1 shifts , you can do that . The beats can be whatever you think is best . <p> Advice it will take a while to get good at scripting songs . As you may have guessed , some songs are a lot easier than others . Once you have done a few , you can expect to spend about two hours making a good , detailed script . Much of the time is spent staring at the computer as the song plays to see if it stays in sync . There really is no way to speed that up . The best approach is to be very careful as you go , because if you miss something like a speed change early in the song , then fixing it will force you to very carefully check the rest of the song to make sure you have n't thrown it off . 
@@88484492 @3984492/ <h> What Came First ? The Alex-Jones Chicken or the Police-State Egg ? <p> Alex Jones would have us believe that the USA was once a fairy-land of liberty , peace , and tranquility . And then the big , bad federal government came along and established a police state , which Jones now claims to be heroically fighting . <p> But is that really the case ? Or is it just the opposite ? Could it be that the federal governments power was expanded , in part , to subjugate rebels exactly like Alex Jones , who were causing trouble long before the federal government could even dream of being a police state ? I believe an historian could make a good case for such a view . <p> In 1791 , when Alex Jones idol , George Washington put down the Whiskey Rebellion , he had to do so with troops borrowed from the various state militias . There was no standing army , and no federal police state whatsoever , but there were plenty of Jonesian , Tea Party-type knuckleheads demanding sovereignty . <p> The USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs : miscellaneous rebels , Confederates , Mormons , Mexicans , Native Americans , etc . Was it wrong to construct the greatest nation in history ? Maybe , but if you polled the people , I think most would prefer the omelet to a crazy patchwork of small nations led by the likes of Alex Jones . <p> Posse Comitatus If there is anything that Alex Jones hates more than police , its soldiers . In his films , there are numerous scenes where Jones paints soldiers as freedom-hating Nazis . Why the hate ? Because of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 which forbade the U.S. armed forces from acting in any kind of police role on U.S. soil . Its sort of like how the CIA is n't supposed to spy on Americans ; just foreigners . <p> Jones carries on like Posse Comitatus is the most-sacred law of the Republic ; right up there with the Second Amendment . But if its so important , how did the USA get along without it for the first 100 years of our existence ? <p> The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you read the history of the Act , it is one of the things that the white-supremacist Democratic party voted into law while in the process of ending the Reconstruction period in the aftermath of the Civil War . Its pretty simple ; they wanted a law that would prevent the Yankee army from interfering in formerly Confederate states as they went about the business of re-subjugating black people . <p> Alex Jones would have us believe that it Is always evil incarnate whenever the Army does something in the USA , but is that the case ? Obviously not . For example , in 2009 the Army helped a Mississippi sheriff deal with a serial killer on the loose . It was just common sense for the sheriff to ask the nearby Army base for help ( see the Samson mass-shooting event ) . <p> Alex Jones openly advocates that Texas secede from the union again . He would happily plunge the USA into civil war again . Imagine Jones leading a mass protest demanding Texas independence , and overwhelming the Texas police and national guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand down and let him do as he pleases . <p> The issue of how and when the Army can operate on U.S. soil is a legitimate one . But Jones carries on like Posse Comitatus is the only thing keeping us from falling under the dominance of a totalitarian police state . But in reality , Jones is for Posse Comitatus for his own selfish reasons : it weakens the federal government , it weakens the security of the U.S. homeland , and it makes it easier for Jones to smash apart the USA . <p> Alex Jones Loves Checkpoints One of the things Jones likes to make a stink about is police checkpoints on the highway . For example , if you start watching his film Police State 2000 at the 10:45 mark , you will see Jones harassing police officers : <p> Jones sneers at the officers , calling them Nazis , cowards , weaklings , and criminals . What terrible crimes against humanity were they committing ? Hard to say because Jones never said what the checkpoint was about . Perhaps he was embarrassed when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a child kidnapped , so he left the reason out of the film which is something only a propagandist would do . A real journalist would make sure viewers knew the reason . <p> In any case , Jones visceral hatred of checkpoints only applies to police ; it does not apply to Jones pals . When Cliven Bundys militia set up checkpoints on Nevada roads , Jones did not have a single word of criticism . In fact , Jones bent over backwards to rationalize Bundys racist comments , and had him as a guest on his podcast a few times . Jones did n't  even mention the checkpoints as I recall . <p> Yes , the Mexican Mormons are battling drug dealers , but why are their checkpoints saintly while the Austin police checkpoints are pure evil ? The answer is that Jones simply hates police and would probably replace them with armed militias who do n't  answer to anybody .

@@88484513 @3984513/ <h> Month : April 2014 <p> You are probably aware that we acquired our southwestern states from Mexico in 1848 , after the Mexican-American War . But what you may not know is that we had to conquer the territory a second time ten years later from the Mormons in the Utah War . In fact , the Mormon nation of Deseret could be considered one of our conquered foes , right up there with England , Spain , Mexico , Japan , Germany , Iraq , etc . <p> Last week , there was what looked like an armed Mormon rebellion in Bunkerville , Nevada . I say " looked like " because the news media only just barely mentioned that Cliven Bundy , the rebellious cattle rancher , is a Mormon . However , until some actual journalism is done , we can consider the following : <p> Bunkerville is a Mormon town , founded by polygamist Mormon communists in 1877 . The towns population is about 1,300 , and the armed mob that ran off the Bureau of Land Management was reported to be about 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was primarily composed of Mormon townspeople . <p> Bundys apparent militia commander , former Nevada sheriff Richard Mack , is a Mormon . And Mack was enamored of the strategy of using women as human shields . Said Mack : <p> " We were actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front . If they 're gon na start shooting , its going to be women that are gon na be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers . " <p> An idea that only a polygamist could love . I do n't  know if Mack is a polygamist , but its important to note that polygamist Mormon towns were in a state of rebellion long before the Bunkerville Rebellion . Cliven Bundy has only taken the rebellion to the next level . Polygamy is against the law in the USA , and towns like Colorado City , Arizona should be fenced off and turned into FEMA camps . Its not enough to put the child-molesting cult leader Warren Jeffs in jail , and have county deputies patrol the town . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Apparently , these towns discourage people from visiting by not having gas stations and restaurants . And they have very large houses , big enough to hold polygamist families . This blogger claims to be a descendant of Joseph Smith , and says that Bunkerville exhibits all the signs of a Mormon polygamous town . <p> These are radical , fundamentalist Mormons , and there ca n't be that many of them , right ? Well , maybe not , however they say that Neo-Confederate bomb-thrower Alex Jones has a lot of Mormons in his radio audience . And Jones brags about how well-prepped his listeners are to wage war on the feds . They have stockpiled food , water , guns , ammo , and libertardian attitudes . Some Jones thralls were at Bunkerville , and Jones had an on-air orgasm when the Mormons trained their sniper rifles on the feds . <p> The moral of the story is that it is dangerous to dismiss this as a minor incident involving a persnickety old rancher and some Tea Party weirdos . In fact , Cliven Bundy has declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disarm every federal agent in the state . ( Most of the sheriffs are probably Mormons . ) This victory has emboldened Bundy , and he is eager to " bomb the next " target as Alex Jones likes to say . <p> And a second war with the Mormons might not be so easy if mainstream Mormons join with their odious fundamentalist cousins . The Mormon Mafia has deep influence , and maybe even control of the nation-security apparatus . See this Los Angeles Times story about the Mormon Mafia in the FBI . <p> On September 11 , 2001 a mystery plane flew menacingly over the White House . The Secret Service had no idea what it was or why it was violating White House airspace , so they ordered an evacuation . Staffers were told to remove their I 'd badges in case snipers were waiting outside . Women were told to take off their shoes so that they could run faster . Turns out , the mystery plane was a USAF E-4B the " Doomsday " command-center plane . Here is the CNN story : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser Brent Scowcroft a Mormon . We know Scowcroft was on the E-4B because he said so on page 17 of his book " America and the World " in 2009 : <p> " On the morning of 9/11 , we were going to fly in one of the presidents flying command posts out to Offutt Air Force Base . We were sitting at Andrews waiting to take off when the first plane hit the Trade Towers . " <p> Did Scowcroft give the order to practically strafe the White House ? Or did the pilot use his own initiative ? Were they just flying over to make sure everything was okay ? Maybe so , but why did n't  they notify the Secret Service ? When I researched this back in 2012 , I could n't find any explanation , or an interview with the pilot . All we know is that one of our top-secret Doomsday planes with Scowcroft on board terrorized the White House . Was the intent to send a message to the old-fashioned , horse-and-buggy , Constitutional , and now largely ceremonial federal government ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge here . " Shades of Alexander Haig . <p> Normally , the president has an E-4B follow him around , but he did n't  have one with him in Florida that day . Another telling fact that needs explanation . Who actually makes those decisions anyway ? Did Bush give the keys to the E-4B to Scowcroft ? Or was the president merely informed that he would not have an E-4B that day ? Who is the decider ? The Pentagon ? <p> Until we learn more about the Deep State , we must entertain the idea that it is controlled , or heavily influenced by a Mormon cabal . However , I would be shocked to see mainstream Mormons throw in with the likes of Cliven Bundy . <p> The federal government will need to push back against Bundy one way or another . The job should be given to a special task force comprised of our Mormon federal employees . If a battalion of loyal Mormon troops , and officials were sent to Bunkerville , fewer fundamentalists would rally to the Bundy cause , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An enterprising journalist might be able to get a good story by interviewing the Mormon boys who may have been expelled from Bunkerville , which is necessary in a polygamist system . HBOs Vice did a segment ( season 1 , episode 5 ) on such " lost boys " from Colorado City . What if Cliven Bundy turned out to be the Warren Jeffs of Bunkerville ? Now that would be a scoop . <p> As Vice was filming their piece , they were stalked by " church security " vehicles . The towns marshals are hand-picked by Warren Jeffs that 's what happens in a theocracy . This page has a good story about the town . <p> This page has a photo of a sniper , probably a Mormon , aiming his rifle at federal officials .

I could walk right by a dumpster full of rotting seafood , and not smell it at all . <p> Back in 1990 , I learned that the phytic acid in whole grains blocked the absorption of minerals such as zinc , which is critical to your senses of smell and taste , as well as a zillion other things such as acne . So , I stopped eating bran cereal for breakfast , and the terrible acne I had on my shoulders cleared right up . But my sense of smell remained sub-par . <p> Back then , there was not a lot of information on phytic acid , and it turns out that it is present in substantial quantities in many other foods . Here I thought that I was being healthy by eating my peas , almonds , cashews , etc. when in reality they are full of deadly phytic acid . Talk about dying of a misprint ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthiest reputation are not healthy at all . <p> Now I avoid phytic acid by eating mostly eggs , dairy , meat , and low-fiber plant foods like white rice and potatoes . Animal products contain zero phytic acid . Now my sense of smell works perfectly . Not only that , but now I know why some people like the taste of beer it really does taste good when your senses are working properly . <p> How much phytic acid is there in different foods ? Hard to say ; amounts vary widely depending on the research methodology . The amount of phytic acid in foods can also be decreased by various forms of cooking and processing . For the details , see this article . The article also points out the positive attributes of phytic acid , but I 'm not buying it since it has such a blatant negative effect on my body . At most , I might eat a small amount of cashews or almonds as a snack late in the day after my body has absorbed the minerals in the food that I ate earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that . <p> So , we need to avoid phytic acid in order to absorb the minerals in the food that we eat . But that is only the first half of the story , because once we absorb the minerals , we need to hold onto them . And we do that by avoiding diuretics like caffeine and alcohol which flush out minerals . <p> Instead of following my advice , you might think you can just eat and drink whatever you want as long as you take extra mineral supplements . But I have tried that , and it does n't  work . After years of trial and error , I have concluded that the only way to get your body to perform at a high level is to treat it like a high-performance machine .

@@88484532 @3984532/ <h> How I Fixed My Poor Sense of Smell <p> For my entire life , I have been baffled by my poor sense of smell . I could walk right by a dumpster full of rotting seafood , and not smell it at all . <p> Back in 1990 , I learned that the phytic acid in whole grains blocked the absorption of minerals such as zinc , which is critical to your senses of smell and taste , as well as a zillion other things such as acne . So , I stopped eating bran cereal for breakfast , and the terrible acne I had on my shoulders cleared right up . But my sense of smell remained sub-par . <p> Back then , there was not a lot of information on phytic acid , and it turns out that it is present in substantial quantities in many other foods . Here I thought that I was being healthy by eating my peas , almonds , cashews , etc. when in reality they are full of deadly phytic acid . Talk about dying of a misprint ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthiest reputation are not healthy at all . <p> Now I avoid phytic acid by eating mostly eggs , dairy , meat , and low-fiber plant foods like white rice and potatoes . Animal products contain zero phytic acid . Now my sense of smell works perfectly . Not only that , but now I know why some people like the taste of beer it really does taste good when your senses are working properly . <p> How much phytic acid is there in different foods ? Hard to say ; amounts vary widely depending on the research methodology . The amount of phytic acid in foods can also be decreased by various forms of cooking and processing . For the details , see this article . The article also points out the positive attributes of phytic acid , but I 'm not buying it since it has such a blatant negative effect on my body . At most , I might eat a small amount of cashews or almonds as a snack late in the day after my body has absorbed the minerals in the food that I ate earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that . <p> So , we need to avoid phytic acid in order to absorb the minerals in the food that we eat . But that is only the first half of the story , because once we absorb the minerals , we need to hold onto them . And we do that by avoiding diuretics like caffeine and alcohol which flush out minerals . <p> Instead of following my advice , you might think you can just eat and drink whatever you want as long as you take extra mineral supplements . But I have tried that , and it does n't  work . After years of trial and error , I have concluded that the only way to get your body to perform at a high level is to treat it like a high-performance machine .

Well , a rich psychopath couldnt be expected to get his hands dirty acquiring his own victims , right ? Surely such a man should enjoy the convenience of employing a fellow psychopath of lesser means to snatch children off the street on his behalf . But we do n't  need to speculate because a rather dramatic example of such a case occurred in Belgium in 1996 . Here is a photo of the White March where approximately 300,000 Belgians took to the streets that 's 3% of the nations population : <p> A protest of similar proportions in the USA would number a massive 9.5 million . Why did the Belgians come so close to overthrowing their government ? What were their demands ? Well , unlike Occupy Wall Street , the Belgians were not the lest bit confused about what they wanted : they wanted the Belgian elite to call off their pet serial killer who was preying upon their children . The psychopathic pedophile in question was one Marc Dutroux . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence for abducting and raping five young girls . Only three years later , a crooked judge turned him loose , and was rewarded with a promotion to a prestigious position . Shortly after that , Dutrouxs own mother sent a letter to the warden saying that she suspected that Dutroux was once again holding girls captive in his house . The letter was ignored . <p> Three and a half years later , police finally searched Dutrouxs house . They heard the cries of the girls coming from the dungeon in the basement , but concluded that the voices were coming from the street outside . And Dutroux was allowed to carry on with his grisly business . <p> Another of the numerous outrageous events occurred after Dutroux was arrested again in 1998 . While being brought to the courthouse , police elected not to handcuff him , and Dutroux " overpowered " a cop , took his gun , and " escaped . " <p> Why was Dutroux treated so leniently ? Because he was n't selfish . He was " sharing " his victims with members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and killing young girls . A government-owned TV station , RTBF , led the propaganda campaign to cover up the conspiracy ( read more here in The Guardian ) . <p> One of Dutrouxs accomplices told police that girls were " were kidnapped to order , for someone else . " So , not only would Dutroux fetch girls for the elite , but he would do it to their specifications ! He would also make snuff films to specification for rich clients a crime very hard for the real police to detect since there is no public marketing involved . <p> Dutrouxs victims were used in pedophiliac parties allegedly orchestrated by prominent Belgian businessman , Jean-Michel Nihoul . Politicians , judges , cops , and other important people were invited , secretly filmed , and blackmailed . And that 's why Dutroux got such favorable treatment from the Belgian criminal-justice system , which was obviously run by criminals . <p> Outrageously , it appears that the photographic evidence of the case was put onto what might be called a " snuff CD " and sent out to the elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels . <p> Maybe you are thinking that this was a special case ; just those crazy Belgians up to high jinks . Well , guess again . Similar cases have occurred in other countries . And while the American people have never had to take to the streets like the Belgians , there have been many suspicious events here . <p> For example , while George W. Bush was governor of Texas , the state mowed down 152 residents of Death Row . Only one was pardoned : the prolific serial killer Henry Lee Lucas . I reckon something was wrong with his paperwork or something Funny thing about Lucas : when he was imprisoned in Michigan , he was sent to Ionia State Mental Hospital where he received electroshock therapy . However , the treatment seems to have changed him from a spur-of-the-moment emotional killer , into a cold-blooded killing machine . So , perhaps the electroshock was n't treatment after all , but rather training MK-Ultra assassin training . After the treatment , Lucas was released early because the prisons were " too crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenient treatment from the courts and police early on . When Rob Piest disappeared in 1978 , his family wanted the police to investigate Gacy . But the Des Plaines , Illinois police had a habit of treating such missing-persons as runaways . According to David McGowan in his book " Programmed to Kill " ( page 179 ) : <p> " The Piest family quickly grew angry with the police over their handling of the case , and they began threatening to storm the Gacy house . In order to pacify the family and prevent them from acting on their threats , police agreed to begin surveillance of John Gacy . " <p> Sort of like the Belgians , right ? Too bad the Piest family did n't  storm the house and find the bodies ; that would have been the stuff of legend . <p> Like Mark Dutroux , Gacy had extensive knowledge of the sins of the local elite by virtue of having helped to facilitate many of those sins . And he was very well-connected in Democratic circles . Here he is with First Lady Roslyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots more . McGowans book has a radical thesis : that the stereotypical serial killer is largely a myth designed to camouflage the work of the elites criminal employees . <p> Note : Roslyn Carter probably was n't in league with Gacy herself , but the photo shows how it was possible that Gacy got lenient treatment as a " pillar of the community .

Russell used the NYSE , but here I will reproduce his idea using the S&amp;P 500 ( click chart to enlarge ) : <p> My first quibble is with the first fan line ( blue ) , which is not drawn through a significant swing low . The late November swing low was the first serous correction of the move up off of the September low .

As long as we are under that line , you could say that the rally up off of the March 2009 low has just been a bear-market rally on the monthly time-frame . And the red line might prove strong resistance for bears to sell against going forward . <p> And if the SPX can break above the red line , then you could argue for giving up the bear-market rally thesis , and expect a challenge of the 2007 top . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> One thought on " Richard Russells Fan Lines " <p> Two months after this post , the market was at the same level .

Australia has been one of the USAs closest military allies for quite a while , and has troops fighting and dying in Afghanistan . <p> So , what were the Australians doing exercising with the Chinese all of a sudden ?

I 'm sure the Australians gave their permission and all , but you have to wonder if they really had a choice . Australias geopolitical situation does n't  allow it to defy the USA . <p> The Chinese are apoplectic over this conquest of Australia ( see the story here ) and they are pressuring the Australians to choose sides . <p> To assuage the Chinese , the Australian frigate HMAS Ballarat just visited Shanghai . here 's the welcoming ceremony : <p> Apparently , there were no live-fire drills this time ; just search-and-rescue practice . <p> This is all happening as we are trying to figure out how to high-tail it out of Afghanistan after getting whooped by the Pashtuns . And there are consequences for loosing a war . When the Arabs saw us bleeding-out in Vietnam , they were emboldened to nationalize our oil properties . When the Soviet Unions satellites saw the Red Army defeated in Afghanistan in 1989 ( by those same Pashtuns ! ) they got ideas of their own .

Maybe in the short-term , but probably not in the long run . Perhaps they will just wait us out . Now that the multinationals have moved all the jobs to Asia , the unemployed American taxpayer can no longer keep the Pentagon in the style to which it has been accustomed . How much longer can it be before the tide of American military power must recede here at the end of this age of imperial overreach ?

Would they head for Yankee territory just like the Muslims of India fled to Pakistan during Gandhis chaos ?

" <p> While the president does n't  say much about his community-organizing days , we do have knowledge of Chavezs activities . So , how did the Mexican-American Chavez organize his community ? Let me tell you <p> but first , if you grew up east of the Rocky Mountains , in a " green , leafy " suburb , like I did , chances are that you have no idea who Chavez was . Maybe you have vague memories of a lettuce shortage , or something about a grape boycott . Well , that was Chavez and his United Farm Workers . The Mexican-Americans that I knew in California spoke of Chavez as a deity ; one rung below Jesus himself . If John Steinbeck had written a sequel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have evolved into a gringo version of Chavez . And Bruce Springsteen would have written even more songs about him . <p> One of the things that Chavez did was try to improve the condition of farm workers by restricting the supply of workers ; to raise the equilibrium wage to a point where they could live better than farm animals . <p> To that end , Chavezs men picketed the INS to get them to enforce immigration laws . Chavez ratted out his fellow Mexicans to the INS if they were illegals . If he found them on the job , he turned a blind eye while his men administered beatings . And in 1973 , Chavez even sent his troops to the border to battle illegals ! See this , and this . <p> The word " immigration " does n't  appear at all in the Presidents proclamation . And for good reason . Because if Chavez were alive today , he just might be voting Republican in November . You see , when Chavezs men were fighting bloody battles on the border , legal immigration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama administration , it has been nearly triple that over a million per year . ( See my immigration charts . ) <p> Obamas policy , unspoken though it may be , is to smash down wages all across the economy to goose corporate profits . The exact opposite of what Chavez tried to accomplish . <p> Today , activists will speak out against state immigration laws like the ones adopted by Arizona and Alabama . And in doing so , they will cite Cesar Chavez . <p> Bizarre , right ? <p> Some of those activists are simply ignorant of what Chavez stood for . Others , I 'm sure , are agents of Team Plutocracy fighting hard to turn the USA into an Asian-style , high-population , low-wage nation , blanketed from sea-to-shining sea with sweatshops and shanty towns , and a stratospheric Gini coefficient .

He was n't lying , and maybe it was just a coincidence that one million is the exact level of legal immigration today ( see the chart here ) , but one wonders Was that the long-term goal discussed in the secret meetings of the Deep State ? Did Kennedy make a Freudian Slip there ? Accidentally revealing the secret goal that he was working toward ? <p> The 1965 bill was the first step toward the modern regime of mass immigration . The second major step was The Immigration Act of 1990 , introduced by , you guessed it , Senator Ted Kennedy . Though with nearly all things in neoliberal America , there was bipartisan support .

Bush signed the bill into law , he made an incredible statement : <p> " I am also pleased to note that this Act facilitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of basic entry rights of those beyond our borders . " <p> Entry rights . Can you imagine ? <p> Kennedy kept busy on immigration right up until his death in 2009 . For example , in his failed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , he wanted a new " Y " visa that would have allowed in another 400,000 " temporary " guest workers per year . Kennedy said that universal health care was the " cause of his life " but it seems to me that his cause was flooding the country with cheap labor . <p> What does this have to do with destroying unions ? Like the snake and the mongoose , the deadly enemy of unions is mass immigration not fascists as you might think . Do n't  take it from me ; take it from " diversity icon " Caesar Chavez who sent men to the Mexican border to beat back illegal immigrants literally . Beatings were administered . Chavez knew that the mass immigration of farm workers would destroy his United Farm Workers union , and that 's exactly what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence that the middle class rose to power , along with the unions , out of the restrictive immigration conditions adopted during the Great Depression . Low immigration made people scarce , and employers had to bid for their services . The people had bargaining power . Not so today .

Mass-immigration has delivered a crushing blow to working-class Americans .

Investors are worried that the economy is stalling and becoming vulnerable to recession . And indeed , if we look at the second derivative of the first chart , we see that jobs growth has stalled . And the annual growth rate has ticked down for the first time since the bottom : <p> However , if you look back at the top of the last cycle , you can see that the growth-rate peaked in early 2006 . And the stock market did n't  top out until October 2007 a year-and-a-half later .

Is it possible for a recession to begin with rates at 0% ? I suppose so , but its not something that has happened in the last 60 years . <p> Now , if Bernanke started raising rates while complaining about a gold bubble , then the odds of a recession would skyrocket . The Fed also likes to have a recession when workers get too uppity . Got to fight that " wage inflation " , right ?

Time will tell , but as I 'm sure you know , swing traders can make huge profits in such a market . I think that 's a more likely scenario for as long as the Fed remains friendly . If the Fed turns hostile , Jean-Claude Trichet style , then I ca n't be responsible for what happens . Of course , the ECB has already backpedaled , so the worlds two most important central banks are now dovish . Maybe its too late , and Trichet has doomed the world to recession .

Chavez ratted out his fellow Mexicans to the INS if they were illegals . If he found them on the job , he turned a blind eye while his men administered beatings .

@@88484615 @3984615/ <h> How to Use Google Charts in WordPress <p> Googles original chart API was pretty easy to use in WordPress , but the new Visualization API is more of a challenge . Now you have to put JavaScript into the post/page header , and WordPress does not make that easy . <p> The approach you take will depend on how your website is structured . My approach may not work for you , however this post will still help you to think about the problem . You can see one of my charts in action on this page . <p> My approach has three components : <p> 1 ) The PHP code that generates the data for a chart resides in a plugin which returns the JavaScript for the Google API . <p> 2 ) The function in the plugin is called from the HEAD section of a new template that I use on posts/pages with charts . <p> 3 ) The chart is then positioned in the body of the post/page with a DIV tag . <p> Since I only had a dozen or so pages with charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HEAD section that figures out which plugin function to call by looking at the page title : <p> if ( getthetitle()==Yearly Bar Chart ) Call plugin function here . <p> The real code is a large SWITCH statement . To see what the plugin produces , view the source code of the page that I linked to above , and scroll down to : <p> var data = **37;392;TOOLONG <p> That 's the beginning of the plugin output . <p> The new API can make very nice charts , but it has a couple of large drawbacks that may annoy you . You cant format the chart title very much . For example , you ca n't center the text . You also can not format your axis labels very much . For example , on some of my old charts , I had two rows of labels , and the new API can not do that .

@@88484617 @3984617/ <h> Thiel in Twenty ! <p> I know that Peter Thiel cant run for president , having been born in Germany , but you get the idea . However , Thiel is already providing critical leadership . here 's a quote from his speech yesterday : <p> " No matter what happens in this election , what Trump represents is n't crazy and its not going away . " <p> This is critical because it is the opposite of what Trump says every day in his stump speech . Trump says that if he loses , his campaign will have been the biggest " waste of time " of his life . I cant believe that that is in the teleprompter . Maybe it is , but I 'll bet that Trump ad-libs that part because it is a really dumb thing to tell your followers , who likely want to hear just the opposite : that the revolution will continue on to victory . Instead , Trump acts like he would hole up in Mar-a-Lago and pout , like he lost a pageant . <p> " if Trump were assassinated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of anybody . Jeff Sessions maybe , but he is the same age as Trump . Not exactly a young firebrand ; speaking of which , where are the young firebrands ? There are n't any . " <p> Well now , new leadership has emerged : Peter Thiel . <p> Its important that Thiel is a billionaire , because that 's pretty much the price of admission . When you take on the Establishment , you are up against trillions of dollars stacked up in the Cayman Islands . In the last 25 years , there have only been two credible challenges , both from billionaires : Trump and Perot . Yes , Bernie Sanders got a lot of small donations , but he was the lucky recipient of a political windfall : the fix was in , so the top talent in the Democratic party did not challenge HRC . That enabled Bernie to scoop up all of the discontent . Proof of this theory is that Sanders has dried up and blown away like a leaf in the Autumn breeze . There never was any there there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with politics . However , he is only just emerging from the Libertarian fog , and now that he can perceive the world more accurately , I think he might change his mind . Once he sees that we are at a dramatic watershed of American history , he may want to claim a larger share of the glory . <p> Thiel cant plan to run for president , but maybe he would be interested in following the Arnold Track and run for governor , or Congress , or the Senate . If California is too Democratic for him , maybe he would be happy moving to Austin . Half of Silicon Valley has already moved there , so he should feel right at home in that more-Republican state . <p> Another thing that Thiel might do is leverage his big-data prowess into developing an election-prediction system that might perhaps dramatically increase the efficiency of political campaigns . <p> Make no mistake , the revolution has just gained some top talent . <p> Note : a knucklehead at SiliconValley.com wrote a PC hit piece on Thiel . Its not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her grand conclusion is that Thiel should be bullied : <p> " Yes , tech falls way short of that goal . But its leaders are trying .

Is it cool to bully people now ? <p> Also , the wonderful Peter Gregory character on Silicon Valley is based on Thiel.

If you have ever heard Alex Jones bloviate , you have heard him machine-gunning criticisms without ever making a policy suggestion . Jones is a shock jock , so there is no reason to expect deep thinking from him , but he definitely has goals that he strives for with demonic energy . Alex Jones wants two things : he wants you to be paralyzed with fear , and he wants to destroy the United States of America as a political entity . <p> Alex Jones has millions of followers . He is the patron saint of the Tea Party , right-wing militias , libertarians , and anarchists . Matt Drudge once predicted that 2013 would be The Year of Alex Jones , and Jones is a major political force , deserving of scrutiny . <p> Destroying the USA If you listen to his podcast for long enough , a couple of months perhaps , you will eventually hear Jones shout : " WE WANT LOCAL CONTROL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he is not well-thought-out , but it is clear that he is opposed to the concept of central government .

What about the homeowners association ? <p> " Local control " can mean a lot of things , and political parties are expected to have a platform , but Jones is not a politician . He is a propagandist . And Jones mission is to simply demonize the enemy the Yankee government in Washington . Jones has a one-point platform : destroy the federal government . <p> Instilling Fear The best way to think of Alex Jones is as a human Stuka dive bomber a terror weapon designed to instill fear in you , the listener . The Stuka was loud , and if Alex Jones is anything , he is loud . When the doctor put the stethoscope on the pregnant belly of Jones mother , he heard : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEMA CAMP ! ! ! " Baby Jones was wrong back then , and he has been wrong ever since ; like a million times in a row . But he wont stop because his goal is not to be right ; his goal is to have a fearful audience motivated to buy prepper supplies from his online store and his advertisers . Guns , ammo , body armor , gold , seeds , water filters , survival food everything you need to survive the impending Armageddon . <p> If you are n't  afraid of Fukushima radiation , how many bottles of Alex-Jones brand iodine will you buy ? Zero . If you are n't  afraid of " chemtrails " how many bottles of " Lung Cleanse " will you buy ? None . The world ends each and every day on the Alex Jones podcast , and I 'm sure that boosts sales to the slow-witted members of his audience . <p> You will never , ever hear Alex Jones recommend that you save for retirement . According to him , only an idiot would want to have money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their attics with prepper supplies . Jones spends a lot of time demonizing the Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. dollar . If he could undermine the financial system , money from bank accounts could be diverted to his store , the value of the gold buried in his back yard would soar , and he could cut the jugular vein of the federal government . For the same reason , Jones promotes tax-cheat con artists like Irwin Schiff , and urges his audience to " withdraw consent , " which is code for not paying taxes . <p> Conclusion Jones two goals work together for his meta goal of getting rich off of the destruction of the United States government . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 2 thoughts on " What Does Alex Jones Want ?

Take a look at this chart of the USO oil ETF ( click to enlarge ) : <p> Notice prices tracing out a flag pattern ( or you could call it a pennant ) which I have bounded in red . Now look down at the volume . The " flag pole " was a high-volume move , and the flag itself is a low-volume consolidation . <p> This is a classic bull flag ! <p> The completion of this pattern-in-progress would see prices running up an equivalent magnitude of the flag pole . The pole began around $100 and ran up to about $113 , so another $13 would be the target for USO . On the futures contract , that would take us up to $150-land . <p> I do n't  trade commodities because I do n't  have an edge on the fundamentals as I believe I do on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect pattern that I just might pick up a few USO shares . <p> Flags are short-lived patterns . This thing could break out at any moment . If it does , stocks will suffer , and my short positions will rocket even higher . So , I will benefit from a breakout in oil , and I do n't  need to play this directly . However , if there is another move down to the low end of the range around $107 on light volume , I might be tempted to jump in . <p> Note : The bear-flags that I wrote about yesterday all broke down on high volume today . That is very strong proof that the trend for the stock market is still down . And if you add that to this scary oil bull-flag , you have a recipe for a mini-Armageddon . Perhaps the world will end early next week since expiration should keep things pinned down until then . That would also give stocks time to move sideways and work-off their over-sold condition . <p> My strategy for the near-term is to short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flag is a good indicator for higher prices BUT , you have to pay attention to divergences . I see a possible negative divergence developing between the price of USO and the MACD , PPO and stochastics . That would make me a little wary of a long USO position , for instance . Just something to think about . <p> John , I see what you mean . However , that same case could have been made with the peak on April 25th : higher prices , but not a higher MACD . Perhaps oil can pop , wreck the stock market , but rack-up the MACD divergence , and then collapse as the market crash puts the final nail in the demand coffin . <p> SK , I used to love to try and short things that I thought were over-priced too .

However , I 'll take the opportunity to short the indices . Reason is simple some of the indices ( such as S&amp;P ) have not shown sharp declines in earnings/dividends due to energy . Once oil corrects , the earnings will also correctly sharply . <p> Secondly , credit crunch has not gone away . Consumer spending is slowing dramatically , and $100+ oil is still much higher than what US economy can handle during a vicious recession . <p> If oil falls to $100 or so , I plan to go long on it .

And theyll have to sell other assets to cover those calls . <p> If oil goes down big , it might be a precursor to a move down in the entire market . Oil might be the tip off that the deflationary spiral is kicking in . That is what the weakness in the markets even with oil dropping is telling us today . If oil stays where it is even with deflation kicking in ( unlikely , but it could become a safe haven like gold , or both could temporarily correct severely ) , things will get uglier than even I am seeing them .

Since the tidal-wave of demand for domestically-produced products would be so huge , we have to make sure that our existing industry could ramp-up swiftly . For example , if we put a tariff on shoes , how long would it be before domestic manufacturers could scale up ? Years ? Decades ? That would be a terrible hardship on female citizens . <p> Of course , just because we put up a tariff does n't  mean that products would stop coming in immediately . They would still come , if needed , but cost a little more . In most cases . In other cases , angry countries might just cut us off completely , and that could indeed be debilitating .

We know for a fact that companies can manufacture products safely , cleanly , and profitably , so why tolerate anything less ? <p> One of the big " free trade " perks for companies is what we might call the Pollution Privilege . So , not only do you make money on cheap labor , but you make additional profits by not having to worry about poisoning the peasants . This , of course , is a barbaric practice and should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are too stupid to make things . Of course , if you send all the factories away , as companies like Apple have done , and then criticize the former workers for having rusty skills , may I suggest the possibility that you are a jackass ? Of course the USA is blanketed with rusty-skilled workers . Republicans like Donald Trump tend to think of retraining as a form of welfare . But this should be one of the very first things that Trump does . Even low-tech production like sewing clothes requires a high level of skill . Putting a Nike factory in the hood , or the trailer park , will be like a UFO landing . The factories have been gone for so long that an entire generation has no idea what goes on there . Ill bet there are lots of old-timers in Detroit who know how to build a carburetor , but even they would need to be retrained on fuel-injectors . We will need thousands of vocational academies , and no , people on food-stamps cant afford to pay for retraining . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because we allow them a free hand to export to our domestic market ? Probably quite a few , so we need to plan for the loss of such " allies . " <p> Monopolies When imports undermine a domestic monopoly , that 's a good thing . But why do n't  we just break up the monopolies ourselves ? If we go back to making things ourselves , this is going to become a bigger issue . If Trump wants a legacy of creating jobs for the people , he would tarnish it by allowing monopolies to gouge people at the cash register . <p> Unions In places like Mexico , union organizers are shot in the head and buried in shallow graves . That 's pretty much a requirement for becoming a U.S. trade partner . Trump is an anti-union guy , and started out preaching against the minimum wage .

Is that a good strategy for winning the votes of mostly-Democratic union members ? Maybe ; maybe not . But he seems willing to bet the election on it . <p> The Gaping Hole in the U.S. Constitution Re-Industrializing with lax environmental regulations , low pay , and harsh working conditions hardly seems worth the effort . Going back to the age-old struggle between unions and robber-barons is not inspiring . So , why do n't  we try for something better ? The word " capitalism " does not appear anywhere in the U.S. Constitution . Back then , we were an agrarian nation , not to mention a barbaric slave state . So , it is not surprising that the founding fathers had nothing to say on the subject of labor relations . <p> If we are going to embark upon a second revolution , why not see if we cant achieve a grand bargain of labor relations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this sounds like tilting at windmills ; an impossible task .

If you are thinking : " We are the USA ; we are a large , powerful sovereign nation , and we can adjust our trade policies as we see fit " then you just havent been paying attention . The policies that we have now were written by corporate lobbyists , and rubber-stamped by a bought-and-paid-for Congress &amp; White House . <p> So , while the multi-national corporations that run this country , and the world , like to keep a low profile , that does n't  mean that they are not there , and it does n't  mean that they wont fight back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a second War of Independence . <p> The probability is very high that Trump will be Faraged " or worse . <p> In other words , do n't  be surprised if things turn ugly .

Not only that , but the Customs Department will be putting on a " drug interdiction " demonstration . ( See the show agenda . ) So , both sides of the drug war will be represented . Maybe not the best idea . <p> The air show is expected to draw a family-friendly crowd .

@@88484708 @3984708/ <h> Alexa Rank <p> Since website traffic is private information , Alexa invented an alternative method for ranking websites . Their " Sparky " plugin/toolbar for popular web browsers transmits all of the websites visited by users to Alexas server . Alexa then analyzes that traffic data and is able to estimate the popularity of websites . <p> Why would anybody take the trouble to install this plugin ? Because it shows you the rank of each website that you visit . So , you get something in exchange for the data that you send to Alexa . <p> For example , if you use Firefox , the Alexa ranking of every website that you visit is shown in the lower-right corner of your browser window . That enables you to quickly judge the popularity of the website . If you operate a website , you can quickly see how you stack-up against your competitors just by going to their sites and looking at their ranks . So , if you strive to build traffic on your site , you definitely want to have the plugin installed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of your competitors with my Rank-O-Matic app . <p> Alexa is an excellent service , but its not perfect . For one thing , Alexa rankings are likely biased toward technical websites . Consider two websites with equal traffic : one dedicated to knitting , and one dedicated to SEO . Which one do you think will have a higher Alexa ranking ? The SEO website , right ? Its audience of webmasters will all have the Alexa plugin installed because they are constantly trying to boost their traffic . <p> Since your Alexa rank is relative to other websites , it is possible for your rank to be going down while your traffic is actually going up . One of the scenarios where this can happen is during the Christmas shopping season . There you are , working away , building your traffic , and all of sudden dozens of shopping websites are soaring past you . So , while your absolute rank is important , how you rank relative to your competitors is more important to judge your traffic-building efforts . <p> The more popular a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , at the time of this writing , Googles rank was #1 , and Facebooks was #2 . But notice that the Alexa rank does n't  tell us how much space there is between the two . Are Google and Facebook neck-and-neck in a horse race ? Or does Google get ten times as much traffic ? We cant tell from looking at the Alexa rank . <p> A very low rank would be something like 16 million . When you see a site ranking that low , it probably has almost no visitors not even the webmaster ! And the rankings of such websites will bounce around a lot because Alexa has very little data to work with . <p> A site ranked 16 million might " jump " to 15.5 million the next day , but that might only mean that it got one more visitor than usual . There is a vast sea of low-traffic sites , so large jumps are not an accomplishment . <p> However , among the top sites , even moving up one notch likely represents a huge increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which owns Alexa ) , moved up from #14 to #11 , no doubt due to a tidal wave of Christmas shoppers . <h> Improve Your Alexa Rank <p> One way to boost your Alexa rank is to simply urge your audience to install the plugin . While that wont affect your real traffic , it might make you feel better , and intimidate your competition ! <p> Another way is to install a discussion forum . Even a small number of frequent participants can push up your Alexa rank . <p> If you have a blog site , check your RSS feed settings . If readers can read entire posts with their RSS-reader program , then they never have to come to your website , and Alexa thinks that you are less popular than you really are . If you set your RSS feed to only send out the first paragraph of each post , people will have to click through to your website and your rank should improve . If you use WordPress , go into your " Reading " settings , and choose " Summary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feed , show " . <p> There are apps out there that claim to boost your Alexa rank by machine-gunning traffic at your site through numerous proxy services . I 've never tried one of them , but I did once see a website jump from about 800,000 to 32,000 in one day . So , that had to be something fishy .

He would not say which one , probably because he wants his followers to bid them both up . <p> In the interview he refused to comment on LEH even if pressed I do n't  know for what reason he bought additional shares , but to me the whole thing read like a " do n't  buy " advice on financials .

@@88484786 @3984786/ <h> I am not a Republican <p> If you have been reading my blog over the past several weeks as I campaigned for Trump , you might be under the impression that I am a Republican , but that is not the case . I have never been a registered Republican . However , while I did n't  go to the Republican Party , the party did indeed come to me by becoming more nationalist and populist . I did n't  change , but the Republican Party sure did . <p> In the historic watershed year of 2016 , Donald Trump defeated the neoliberal elite of the Republican Party . At the same time , the neoliberal elite of the Democratic Party carried the day by railroading Bernie Sanders . So , campaigning for Trump was an easy choice in such a clear-cut battle between globalists who wanted to erase our borders , and nationalists who wanted to restore our borders . <p> Sure , Trump is a little too necon-y for my taste , and Sanders was a little to socialist-y , but nobody is perfect . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of what was happening . But the election results make the mandate clear , and up-and-coming politicians should be able figure out which way the wind is blowing now . <p> It was n't neocon war-mongering , trickle-down economics , or conservative moralizing that won the day . Those stale issues did not implode the Democratic Blue Wall . The fact that the Rust Belt states flipped from blue to red tells the story . That region was first devastated by " Right to Work " laws that created relatively-cheap labor in the Sun Belt . Then a wave of " free trade " treaties created dirt-cheap labor in foreign lands . And those laws were created to facilitate a huge wealth-transfer program from middle-class workers to robber-baron billionaires . <p> Trump promised to put an end to Ross Perots Giant Sucking Sound convincingly enough to sway voters . Now he has to deliver in order to keep his electoral-college majority . <p> Well and good . <p> But will I change my party affiliation from Independent to Republican ? That remains to be seen . I 'm still not convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team just does n't  have a deep bench . After all , if something happened to Trump , could Mike Pence be counted on to lead the revolution ? Not hardly . When Pence was in Congress , he voted for every globalist trade agreement that came before him . Having a Koch-brothers guy like Pence as president would be the end of the revolution . <p> Speaking of the Koch brothers , I once voted for David Koch for Vice President . That was during my first presidential election in 1980 when Koch was the running mate of Ed Clark on the Libertarian ticket . I had become a Libertarian after reading Robert Ringers book , Restoring the American Dream which I found by browsing at Walden Books . <p> Back then , the Libertarian Party seemed fresh and revolutionary , and free-market ideology appealed to me because it seemed to sweep away corruption . Then I saw Milton Friedmans Free to Choose on PBS and was baffled . How could something so revolutionary be on government TV ? I wondered about that for decades until I finally learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military-industrial complex . Heres what I wrote in my first book : <p> " PBS was founded to promote the Vietnam War . In the 1960s , television rose to power , and its news journalists were very critical of the war . So , President Lyndon Johnson set up PBS and made Frank Pace , Jr . chairman . Pace was a former Secretary of the Army , and a former CEO of General Dynamics Corporation , a huge defense contractor . " <p> As a Libertarian , I was also baffled by free-trade treaties like the GATT . How could all of these evil governments be expanding freedom by tearing down artificial borders ? <p> Thinking back on it , libertarian ideology was definitely a form of brainwashing . Even when Ross Perot became famous for his Giant Sucking Sound in the 1990s , I still could n't figure it out . It took 30 years before I finally realized that the Libertarian Party was just a propaganda arm of the robber-baron Koch brothers . <p> The first critical thing I wrote about the global economy on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in July 2009 . It was triggered by IBM when they told their engineers that if they wanted to keep their jobs they had to relocate to India . As a former IT worker myself , I was aghast . IBM was forcing people to move to a Third World hellhole , get malaria , and work for local wages , i.e. $2 per hour . That was so blatantly evil , not even the most rock-ribbed Libertarian could deny it . <p> Shortly after that , I changed my party affiliation to Independent and began to regard Libertarians as the useful idiots of the robber barons . And I became a rapacious critic of globalism . My next such post tore into CNBCs globalist/libertarian Michelle Caruso-Cabrera , who I described as Dumb as Bag of Hammers when she blessed the mass exodus of manufacturing jobs to China . After that , I went on a seven-year long , Archer-style rampage against the globalists . <p> A central tenet of the libertarian brainwashing is that all labor unions are inherently evil , and that labor is a commodity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expendable , it is only a short hop to slavery . And indeed , we have seen many cases of slave-like working conditions , not only in the Asian supply chains of multinational corporations , but right here in the USA . Funny thing is that libertarians are vehemently anti-slavery , but support policies that lead directly to it . <p> Now , I am what I like to call a middleclassitarian : I want to restore the policies that created Americas historic , huge , and prosperous middle class . A standard of living that billions around the world literally drooled over . In my view , the bedrock of the middle class was comprised of the sharply restricted immigration policy adopted in the 1930s , and the traditional protective tariffs that sheltered our growth into a super power . The tariffs kept jobs in , and the low immigration quotas kept the cheap labor out . Labor become a little bit scarce , and instead of using workers up like so many lumps of bauxite , employers had to bid for their services , and treat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently , the middle class has been ravaged . <p> 2012 was my first election as an ex-Libertarian . In previous elections , I had voted for any Libertarians on the ballot , and if there were none , I voted for Republicans . I do n't  think I ever voted for a Democrat , who Libertarians consider to be communists . But Mitt Romney was one of the robber barons who , at Bain Capital , personally fired American workers , and sent their jobs to China " and got rich in the process . So , I had to vote to strike him down , and pulled the lever for Obama . I did n't  expect anything from Obama , but I really enjoyed punching Romney in the face . It seemed like a small thing at the time , but as we now know , that was the end-of-the-line for the neoliberal elite in the Republican Party . <p> Note : one of the ways that the Republican Party came around to my way of thinking was the way our enormous food-stamp population is viewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47% comment " but Newt Gingrich also deployed a " lazy black people on food stamps " line of argument during the 2012 primaries . After I pointed out that the majority of the people on food stamps were white , Gingrich was forced to stop . My position was that the vast bulk of the food-stamp population was not lazy , but rather were the victims of globalization and mass-immigration . In 2016 , the Republicans stopped their ridiculous , conservative moralizing . Instead of having a globalist like Mitt Romney scolding them , poor people had a nationalist/populist like Donald Trump promising to help them out of poverty . And that made all the difference . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 4 thoughts on " I am not a Republican " <p> This is an excellent blog posting which explains in great detail why someone would abandon the doctrine of economic libertarianism ( classical liberalism ) . <p> Not only are many libertarians useful idiots for the globalist billionaires , they are often the biggest promoters of the political-economic interests of our adversaries of the United States ( Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the utopian rhetorical eyewash , much of the libertarian and modern conservative movement are really arms of the multinational corporations and investment banks . These globalist institutions in turn profit from trade with Americas enemies and foreign trade rivals . <p> The issue is not economic freedom and private property per se . The larger issue is the divorcing of national patriotism and morality from our big business elites . Part of this stemmed from the heavy helpings of libertarian and pro-big business/anti-labor viewpoints which are deluged in the schools of business and finance . Milton Friedman , Greg Mankiw , Peter Drucker , and Theodore Leavitt are some examples of the pro-big business , anti-labor , and libertarian viewpoints that are doled out in the schools of business , finance , and economics . Ideas which call for what I term Balanced and Nationalist Capitalism are generally crowded out of academia . Much of the mainstream media and K-12 education also support internationalism as opposed to any sense of economic nationalism . This needs to change and it will take a mass movement supported by wealthy patriotic businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) to carry this agenda forward . <p> What did it for me was when the libertarians and even many of the modern conservatives slowly became the worst apologists for Beijing and even Moscow . Virtually all Republicans voted to give Putin Permanent Normal Trade Relations in November 2012 . That was an Obama-Clinton initiative by the way . And yes , we all knew that Putin was anti-American and still wedded to expanded Russian power on the world stage . It was known through the revelations of Russian military and intelligence defectors ( Sergei Tretyakov , Stanislav Lunev , Vil Miryaznov , Alexander Litvinenko , and others ) and intrepid journalists such as Bill Gertz that Moscow continued to gear up for war after 1991 and subvert the US . Yet the Republicans and corporate Democrats were wedded to free trade , globalization , and the donor class . Same goes with China .

The promises of Reagan and the supply siders were hollow . Ironically , the biggest employment engines in the 1980s and after were the government and service sectors . In my view , that 's problematic for the long term viability of the free enterprise system both in terms of purchasing power and the effects on the tax base . The size and scope of the welfare state increased simultaneously with union busting , open borders , and free trade . Low wage employers received government subsidies thanks to Bill Clintons " welfare reform . " It did n't  attack the true reasons behind unemployment and underemployment ( open borders and free trade ) . <p> This state of affairs needs to be reversed in order to ensure our national survival .

Heres what I wrote in my book : <p> " During the conquest of Iraq , many American troops were killed and maimed because we did n't have the manufacturing capacity to make the special , super-strong steel needed to harden Humvees against IEDs , ( improvised explosive devices ) . There were only two armor-quality steel mills left in the USA " and both were owned by foreign companies ! One of them by a Russian company ! " <p> In a war with a major nation , we would likely discover many more such vulnerabilities the hard way . <p> This is quite interesting , and maybe you should put that cathartic explanation in a more easily accessed permanent spot on your blog . For a long-time I thought I was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-patriotic . Let 's face it , corporate elites who make millions can simply walk away from their jobs after committing crimes ( and pseudo crimes ) which tear the country apart .

The ppl who have such loads of cash ( ok , I 'm a little jealous ) that they can store it in a foreign country to avoid paying taxes are not real Americans in my honest opinion . Their fathers and grandfathers usually have not served in war or any armed forces ; yet they think they are the ones that are owed some kind of allegiance from the masses and are the ones making the calls on where and when we deploy forces . I would slap a tax on every one of the jobs/ wages lost to any third-world underpaid workforce . Smacks of liberalism , yes , but the loss of jobs for ppl of average intelligence is ridiculous at this point .

The pattern has been established over three weeks , so it looks pretty solid . Here is a 60-minute chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> ( I find that hourly charts are the best for spotting emerging patterns . ) <p> If you look at a TRIN chart over the same period , you will see that the last two Monday Massacre sell-offs were dramatically more intense than the first sell-off that began on August 11th . The TRIN takes into account not only the number of stocks advancing/declining , but also the volume . <p> I think that this increasing intensity is due to bulls having their mouses hovering over the sell buttons on their screens .

I miss-played that set-up because USO was oversold , and the pattern was only about three days old . <p> SPYs descending-triangle is very well-defined over a nice period of time . SPY is also overbought on a short-term basis , and a longer term basis . Good news in the form of the durable-goods number on Wednesday morning , failed to break SPY out of the pattern to the upside , so it looks like the large players have little interest in accumulating stocks , even on good news . <p> I like the set-up technically . I also like it fundamentally . The economy is clearly slowing . So is the global economy . And the credit crisis is actually getting worse judging by credit spreads , and more banks being added to the FDICs trouble list . <p> I think the big funds will likely be able to keep the market from breaking down as they bid underneath to keep their monthly numbers looking good .

So , I have taken a short position in the futures , and am hoping that the big funds can hold things up long enough Thursday for me to complete an all-in short deployment . <p> SPYs old breakout area at $129 served as resistance Wednesday . So , our trading range is $126-$129 . If any of this weeks remaining economic reports pushes SPY above $129 , I will be shorting as I think it will likely prove to be a false breakout . <p> Keep in mind that the tape has not rolled over yet , as of Wednesdays close , though the futures are down a couple of points as I write this late Wednesday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one hand , you will have the big funds bidding underneath in a low-volume environment .

This is a very bad development for the dollar since it is very likely to take another leg down . <p> Also , the dollars strength during the March-to-May bear-market rally in stocks was very likely due to overseas money buying into that rally . Euros , Yens , Loonies , etc. , must first convert themselves into dollars before they can buy US stocks . So , overseas money coming into US stocks automatically gives the dollar a boost due to increased demand . <p> So , no matter how much Larry Kudlow shouts shouts " KING DOLLAR !

The two nations shared a language , culture , and history , so such a unification should have been easy , right ?

And that 's more than the USA spends on its massive food-stamps program ( $65 billion ) . <p> In addition to that financial burden , West German workers had their wages beat down when millions of desperate East German workers were dumped into their labor pool . <p> So , after 20 years of effort , this modest unification process is still causing indigestion for one of the top economic powers in the world . <p> However , what the USA is doing completely dwarfs the German project . <p> We have been integrating China into our industrial base for 10 years now .

" <p> Matt , when I look at your other graph of the year-over-year growth rate on a daily basis , there was still positive growth of between 4-6% occurring from Jan 1 to March 3st . Why , with this graph , are you now saying that there was no growth ? ! If you 're using the same number of days , the result should be somewhere around 5%-ish growth . This does n't  make sense to me <p> This is a quarter-over-quarter calendar-based comparison where I threw out the March 31st number to balance the extra day we had for leap year . <p> My main charts are year-over-year which , of course , always include four quarters of data rather than one . So , you cant expect the two to always be in sync . <p> For example , the number calculated for March 31st on the yearly chart does n't  tell you anything about the quarter-over-quarter trend . That number compares the year ended March 31 , 2008 to the year ended March 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does make sense . Also , any way you slice it , the first quarter of this year saw an alarming deceleration . <p> You should be careful in how you compare figures . While there are 91 days in 2008 Q1 versus only 90 days in 2007 Q1 , there were only 62 reports released during both time periods . <p> TABLE # of reports released <p> 2007 2008 Jan 21 21 Feb 19 20 Mar 22 21 TOTAL 62 62 <p> If you assume that the number of reports released correspond to the typical # of work days for office workers , March 31st 2008 release should be included within 2008 Q1 to make this figure comparable to 2007 Q1 . <p> I 'm not disagreeing that there has been a remarkable slowdown from 2007 to 2008 . However , to state that the year-over-year growth is 0% is incorrect . <p> I think that comparing the first 90 calendar days from each year is an interesting exercise . <p> Evening-up the number of reports is a good way of measuring . But it is not foolproof either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . Those reports reflect that most paychecks are cut at the same time every other Friday . <p> Perhaps the monster report from April 1st should be included in the first quarter . The BEA also reported that indexation caused a $5 billion drop in January . Adjusting the numbers downward for inflation can also be done . Of course , if you start adjusting the data like this you have to adjust the entire series . <p> Looking at shorter time periods like months and quarters is interesting , but I would n't use it to make decisions . This data series is lumpy , and the lumps make the growth percentages bounce around a lot . That is why I use year-long periods on my main charts . <p> Even with year-long periods , you still get some big bounces when a period begins and ends with a monster day and your total gets inflated . When you compare that to the following year-long period , you get a surprisingly low growth percentage . <p> I have been studying ways to smooth out these lumps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question that you do a great job and that what you 've stated is generally true . However , it may be useful if you were to provide footnotes somewhere indicating # of days covered , # of reports released , # of monster reports covered , etc. so that it is easier to understand whether there may be any upward/downward biases in the graphs . <p> Sorry about being so picky about this . My job is very statistics-oriented where its important to review things on an apples-to-apples basis . When an opinion is stated based on apples-to-oranges comparison without clear identification of potential data problems , this frustrates me somewhat . <p> Anyway , repeating what I said above , the time and effort that you put into this is greatly appreciated !

Why , with this graph , are you now saying that there was no growth ? ! If you 're using the same number of days , the result should be somewhere around 5%-ish growth . This does n't  make sense to me <p> This is a quarter-over-quarter calendar-based comparison where I threw out the March 31st number to balance the extra day we had for leap year . <p> My main charts are year-over-year which , of course , always include four quarters of data rather than one . So , you cant expect the two to always be in sync . <p> For example , the number calculated for March 31st on the yearly chart does n't  tell you anything about the quarter-over-quarter trend . That number compares the year ended March 31 , 2008 to the year ended March 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does make sense . Also , any way you slice it , the first quarter of this year saw an alarming deceleration . <p> You should be careful in how you compare figures .

However , to state that the year-over-year growth is 0% is incorrect . <p> I think that comparing the first 90 calendar days from each year is an interesting exercise . <p> Evening-up the number of reports is a good way of measuring . But it is not foolproof either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . Those reports reflect that most paychecks are cut at the same time every other Friday . <p> Perhaps the monster report from April 1st should be included in the first quarter . The BEA also reported that indexation caused a $5 billion drop in January . Adjusting the numbers downward for inflation can also be done . Of course , if you start adjusting the data like this you have to adjust the entire series . <p> Looking at shorter time periods like months and quarters is interesting , but I would n't use it to make decisions . This data series is lumpy , and the lumps make the growth percentages bounce around a lot . That is why I use year-long periods on my main charts . <p> Even with year-long periods , you still get some big bounces when a period begins and ends with a monster day and your total gets inflated .

My job is very statistics-oriented where its important to review things on an apples-to-apples basis .

@@88484841 @3984841/ <p> Let 's assume that Lesnar has trained-up enough to avoid getting caught in a ridiculous foot-lock like the one that Frank Mir defeated him with . ( When was the last time a UFC fighter was defeated by a foot lock anyway ? Ever ? ) And since Couture is no submission specialist , he will have to find another way to defeat Lesnar . But Randy is very smart , and if it is possible , he is the fighter most capable of designing an anti-Lesnar game plan . <p> Part of the solution might come from Coutures Greco-Roman wrestling experience . Lesnar has defeated many freestyle wrestlers , and fake wrestlers , so maybe Randy can surprise him with some slick Greco-Roman moves . <p> Coutures biggest problem may be that he does not have enough film of Lesnar to find flaws in Lesnars game . Lesnar only has a few rounds of MMA experience . <p> Both Lesnar and Couture are decorated wrestlers . We know that Randys boxing is pretty good , but we have n't seen enough of Lesnars stand-up to make a judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see from Lesnar . The last thing we need is to have Tito Ortizs boring ground-and-pound replaced by Lesnars boring ground-and-pound . <p> Frank Mir said that he saw stars after Lesnar knocked him down with a right hand . Heath Herring literally flew across the ring after another Lesnar right hand . We need to see more of that . Lots more . Watching the strike in slow motion , you see that Herring was like a deer frozen in the headlights . Lesnar was that much faster . And do n't  forget that Lesnar landed two very nice leg kicks on Herring too . <p> It would be sad if Lesnar would continue to think of himself as primarily a wrestler because he has the speed and agility to do some awesome stand-up . And he should take note of the fact that even fighters who are competent on the ground , like Chuck Liddell and Rich Franklin , try to keep fights standing up to please the fans . Ideally , Lesnar would throw some strikes , do a lightening fast take-down , get into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knock him head-over-heals , lather , rinse , repeat . <p> Heath Herring has never been a UFC champion , but he did defeat an equally gigantic wrestler , Mark Kerr , back in 2001 . So , I think the fact that Lesnar was able to totally rag-doll Herring is a significant achievement . <p> I say that Lesnar is dumb because he ca n't figure out how to play nice with others . He got cut from the NFLs Minnesota Vikings because he was basically too much of a jerk . Lesnar is no team player , and make no mistake , MMA is a team sport . You may fight in the ring by yourself , but if you do n't  train with a solid team , your success will be greatly diminished . <p> Lesnar is a lot like another very talented wrestling jerk , Matt Hamill . When Hamil was on The Ultimate Fighter TV show , the other fighters ganged up on him and gave him a beating that 's how much of a jerk he is . Like Hamill , Lesnar trains by setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work with him . That 's not the best way to train . You want to join a camp with wise , graybeard coaches and other champion fighters . That 's how fighters like Anderson Silva and Thiago Alves do it . <p> Lesnar : " I like to do things on my own " in his private gym . Lesnar : as a kid , " I did n't  make any friends . Life is not about making friends . " This is a very wrong attitude . <p> Randy is the exact opposite of Lesnar in this regard . He owns a chain of MMA gyms and has always trained with other top fighters . Lesnar may be talented enough to get away with being a lone-eagle jerk , but he will never reach his full potential with that type of training . <p> I also think that Lesnar might be dumb because he hit both Mir and Herring with rabbit punches . Is he too dumb to learn simple rules , or is he just too negligent to learn the rules ? In either case , its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to master in MMA . It is my impression that fighters who make mistakes like this do n't  go on to become champions . <p> As an MMA fan , I was overjoyed when a real fighter , Frank Mir , defeated the phony-baloney " professional " wrestler , Lesnar . That fool Hulk Hogan is always going on about how UFC fights are fake and that the fighters " work light . " What an imbecile . Of course , Hogan wisely watches UFC fights from the audience with his daughter Brooke , instead of getting into the ring . <p> Unlike Hogan , Lesnar is a real accomplished athlete . The problem though , is that he has spent too many years pretending to fight when he could have been developing real MMA skills . If Lesnar were facing a young Randy Couture , he would n't have much of a chance . <p> But I will not root for Couture . If Couture wins , he might run off and pout about his pay and hire layers to sue the UFC again .

But once on the ground he does n't  know really what to do . Basic MMA skills missing . Actually he wears out his opponents when he sits on them with his massive body . But maybe Couture can " outsmart " him . BTW , Frank Mir defeated Lesnar with a leg bar . The foot lock was only complementary . For me its like the fight between a mostly brainless powerhouse and a smart experienced MMA fighter . I think the fight will go like all the other Lesnar fights except the one against Mir . But I 'm still hoping for the underdog . What a cinderella story . A 45 years old guy against a young muscle monster . And the old guy wins . = <p> The fight of the evening will be Kenny Florian vs .

So that is definitely a weakness for Lesnar , and it was sort of comical to see the smaller Couture keeping the giant Lesnar pinned up against the fence for so long . <p> Between rounds , Randy had to take his mouth piece out and take deep breaths . So while everybody was looking for Lesnar to gas , it was actually Randy who gassed first . <p> I would give Lesnar a slight edge in the wrestling . Randy had him pinned to the fence for a long time , but Brock did get two take-downs . Randy avoided damage on the ground right up until the end . What won the fight for Lesnar was his lightening fast striking .

He fought the " chemically enhanced " Sean Sherk to a five-round decision . Amazing . I cant wait for his fight with BJ Penn . I do n't  think Florian can beat Penn . Florian struggled with Sherk and lost the decision , but Penn totally rag-dolled Sherk at UFC 84 . <p> When I first saw JC Penn I thought what an arrogant asswipe he is . But now that I better understand his fighting style , I 'm a big fan of him . At least I know why he is called " The Prodigy " . He is very special and has qualities nobody else has . <p> BJ Penn is a prodigy , but before he defends his lightweight title against Florian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welterweight title at UFC 94 .

Penn used to fight at welterweight until he lost to GSP and Matt Hughes , so he dropped down to lightweight . <p> Penn might be able to beat GSP only because he used to be lazy and did n't  train hard . After he got beat down to lightweight , he got training religion and now has the eye of the tiger .

@@88484853 @3984853/ <h> Ascending Triangle on SPY <p> USO ( the oil ETF ) has a descending-triangle pattern on its chart . Here is a 15-minute chart of Monday and Tuesdays trading ( click to enlarge ) : <p> USO has bounced off of support in the $91 area twice . However , notice that the second bounce was much weaker than the first . This is a bearish pattern , and USO will likely fall through $91 soon . <p> I am looking to short any low-volume approach up to the black downtrend line , or failing that , am ready to pile on short if the blue line looks like it is giving way . After a breakdown out of the pattern , USO should free-fall for $3-$4 before it finds the next support level around $87 . <p> SPY SPY has closed above its breakout level of $129 for three days in a row now . Normally , the shorts stop pressing their bets when they see that . The S&amp;P 500 is now oversold on a short-term basis , so while SPY can decline further from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point within the next few days . <p> SPY can also fall farther without being technically broken , or even challenged . Tomorrow , SPY could fall to $127 and still be at its uptrend line ( black ) . Buying at that point has been money-in-the-bank three times in a row : <p> XLF Unfortunately for SPY , it is being held down by the XLF boat anchor . XLFs ascending-triangle pattern off of the July low has degenerated into a rectangle pattern trading between $21-$23 . See the blue lines bounding the rectangle on the chart : <p> Rectangles are bullish patterns , so XLF is not on the critical list yet . However , during the last four days , XLF has been up two days , and down two days , with the volume being a bit heavier on the down days . So , XLF has to be watched very closely . If it falls out of the rectangle , then it is in trouble . <p> Tuesday afternoon , XLF bounced off of the $21 level with very strong volume , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be OK for a while . However , on this bounce , it is important for XLF to rally up to the top line of the rectangle . If it cant manage that , then the next trip back down to the lower line will have a good chance of breaking through . <p> QQQQ The Qs need to rally quickly . They have a potential double-top on their intra-day chart from Monday and Tuesday . See it here on this 15-minute chart : <p> The bounce on strong volume at the end of the day Tuesday shows that the Qs probably intend to rally , at least initially , on Wednesday assuming at least a neutral news flow . <p> Apple has broken above its recent downtrend line , and seems intent on dragging the Qs up ; so Apple is an important stock to watch . <p> According to the short-term model that I use , the NASDAQ-100 has n't  been this oversold since August 1st , so a bounce in the near future seems likely . <p> IWM The IWM has blown right through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the June peak .

If I did trade it , I would have went long yesterday based on the high-volume bounce and the Georgia news which would have been a loser . <p> Based on the chart , are you saying that not only has the XLF have to avoid a loss ( breaching down past the rectangle ) , but that it actually has to break-out upward on naked-short-Wednesday ? A upward breakout tomorrow would really surprise me . <p> On a related note , how would a downward breakout of XLF affect SPY , technically speaking . I do n't  see SPY getting past 135 max withouth XLF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot this weakness in the SPY chart , rather than act on it from a fundamental basis ? <p> Concerning IWM , I agree that it should outperform big cap ( DOW , SP500 ) in a strong-dollar environment . The corollary is it should also underperform in a weak dollar environment , right ? It has n't  . We have been in a weak dollar environment for a few years , but it looks like it has only underperformed in the first half of 2008 . <p> The small caps with low debt will do well , but the ones that rely on bankrolling will have problems because of the credit crunch . <p> XLF has to reach the top of the rectangle during this wave upward , no matter how long it takes . It could be three days of small gains . It does n't  have to breakout ; all it has to do is continue to oscillate between the lower and upper bounds . If it can only make it halfway up before turning back down , then that is an indication that it may breakdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking at the oscillations and judging how strong they are to try to predict which way the pattern will break . <p> SPY cant get far without XLF , so an XLF breakdown would make me skeptical of SPYs chances . <p> Matt- One of the indicators that I use is the SPX 3 DMA .

@@88484857 @3984857/ <h> How to Insert Sample Data in a Salesforce Unmanaged Package <p> If you want to distribute an unmanaged package that needs sample data , or default data , you will hit a few roadblocks when you try to do so . First , Salesforce does not allow the ideal solution ; it will not call the installHandler interface , even though it allows you to implement it . Apex will compile your installHandler class , but when somebody installs your package , it will just be ignored . Your app will install okay otherwise , but it will not have its data . <p> Next , you might try to put your install code in the constructor of your Apex controller . However , DML code is not allowed in a constructor , so that will not work either . <p> Your third idea might be to put your install code in a future method and call it from your constructor . But that is also forbidden . <p> Your fourth idea might be to use the " action " attribute of the Apex " page " tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! makeData " &amp;gt <p> Your makeData() method will be fired before the page loads , however the manual warns : " This action should not be used for initialization or DML . " <p> We might guess that there is something in the Salesforce architecture at a deeper level that simply makes this sort of thing impossible , no matter what loophole you might dream up . Consequently , we have to install our data after the app is installed and loaded into a page . And I can think of two options : <p> First , you might put a button on the page called " Make Data " and inform your users to click it the first time they run your app . Your constructor would check the database to see if any data was present , and if so , hide the button so that the user never sees it again . <p> Second , the only way that I can see to install your data automatically is to use an Apex actionPoller component on your Visualforce page : <p> So , add a property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true in the constructor . That will turn on the actionPoller , and 5 seconds after the page loads , your checkData() method will be called . The method should immediately set pollerOn to false so that the actionPoller does not fire again . Your checkData() method would then check the database , and if there were no data , it would insert it . <p> This approach works fine , however you can not reduce the 5-second delay since that is the minimum interval for the actionPoller component . Consequently , if your app needs to immediately display the data , there is a chance that the user will conclude that the app is broken , and close the page before your code even gets called . So , you just need to put a " Please wait a moment " message somewhere on the page . <p> As you will see in the code below , I put my data into JSON format , and uploaded it into my package as a static resource . <p> So , in addition to the apex markup discussed above , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@88484867 @3984867/ <h> How to Insert Sample Data in a Salesforce Unmanaged Package <p> If you want to distribute an unmanaged package that needs sample data , or default data , you will hit a few roadblocks when you try to do so . First , Salesforce does not allow the ideal solution ; it will not call the installHandler interface , even though it allows you to implement it . Apex will compile your installHandler class , but when somebody installs your package , it will just be ignored . Your app will install okay otherwise , but it will not have its data . <p> Next , you might try to put your install code in the constructor of your Apex controller . However , DML code is not allowed in a constructor , so that will not work either . <p> Your third idea might be to put your install code in a future method and call it from your constructor . But that is also forbidden . <p> Your fourth idea might be to use the " action " attribute of the Apex " page " tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! makeData " &amp;gt <p> Your makeData() method will be fired before the page loads , however the manual warns : " This action should not be used for initialization or DML . " <p> We might guess that there is something in the Salesforce architecture at a deeper level that simply makes this sort of thing impossible , no matter what loophole you might dream up . Consequently , we have to install our data after the app is installed and loaded into a page . And I can think of two options : <p> First , you might put a button on the page called " Make Data " and inform your users to click it the first time they run your app . Your constructor would check the database to see if any data was present , and if so , hide the button so that the user never sees it again . <p> Second , the only way that I can see to install your data automatically is to use an Apex actionPoller component on your Visualforce page : <p> So , add a property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true in the constructor . That will turn on the actionPoller , and 5 seconds after the page loads , your checkData() method will be called . The method should immediately set pollerOn to false so that the actionPoller does not fire again . Your checkData() method would then check the database , and if there were no data , it would insert it . <p> This approach works fine , however you can not reduce the 5-second delay since that is the minimum interval for the actionPoller component . Consequently , if your app needs to immediately display the data , there is a chance that the user will conclude that the app is broken , and close the page before your code even gets called . So , you just need to put a " Please wait a moment " message somewhere on the page . <p> As you will see in the code below , I put my data into JSON format , and uploaded it into my package as a static resource . <p> So , in addition to the apex markup discussed above , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

See the 42:25 mark : <p> Jones has no criticism for David Koresh , but Koresh was a maniac . What kind of church settles its disputes with gun-play ? Answer : the Branch Davidians . In 1983 , Koresh and his followers were driven out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four years later , Koresh led a counterattack , and during the gun battle , Roden was shot . Koresh was tried for murder , but got off on a mistrial . <p> Sound like any church you 've ever been to ? What could possibly get men so excited about theology ? Perhaps it was n't about religion at all , but something more along demonic lines like sex with underage girls . <p> Koresh , a self-declared messiah , was able to convince his followers to hand over their underage daughters . In 1995 , Kiri Jewell testified that Koresh got his hands on her when she was 10 years-old : <p> Koresh was investigated by Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 , but the cult closed ranks and lied to the investigators . Does Alex Jones advocate child molestation ? No , however he is a vociferous critic of Child Protection Services . So , we are left wondering exactly how children like Kiri would be protected in a Jonesian utopia , or if they would be protected at all . <p> Obviously , Janet Reno should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been to build a fence around the place , put up guard towers , convert it into a prison , and allow only the children to leave . Any " sweet " church lady who hands her young daughter over to some self-proclaimed Messiah is a criminal in my opinion . <p> In any case , Jones whitewashing of the Davidian cult is , at a minimum , questionable . A man with half a brain would at least seek to distance himself from Koresh , but apparently Jones is not such a man . <p> A few years before Waco , there was another incident of the police battling an odious , heavily-armed cult called MOVE in Philadelphia . Every once in a while you will hear Jones on his podcast taking the side of MOVE . From the MOVE Wikipedia page : <p> " MOVE made compost piles of garbage and human waste in their yards which attracted rats and cockroaches ; they considered it morally wrong to kill the vermin with pest control . " <p> Can you imagine living next to that ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last media supporter of the notorious racist , Cliven Bundy , and his armed militia in Bunkerville , Nevada . Like the Davidians , the Bundy Militia nearly had a shoot-out to settle a dispute . The Young Turks has coverage : <p> In May of 2014 , shortly after Cliven Bundy arrived on the scene , Jones learned how the Mormon militias in Mexico had driven off the drug cartels and the Mexican Army . Jones was ecstatic , and explicitly embraced the armed militia/cult as his " Rosetta Stone " for solving the " problem " of government . <p> At the 00:02:24 mark of the May 11 , 2014 episode of his podcast , Jones says : <p> " What 's happened in Mexico is a Rosetta StoneIts a brush fire that if wind hits it , and if we fan the flames , will burn down tyranny and create a verdant system of low crime and just luxurious freedom world wide . And a return to chivalry , knighthoodIm going to try to be calm . This is so monumental , what 's happening in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute the people of Mexico . " <p> At the 00:21:52 mark Jones continues : <p> " the Mormon Mexicans down there who started all of this . Youve got to give them credit ; its kind of like Cliven Bundy is a Mormon . Say what you want about the Mormons , but they 're the ones doing thisThey are literal AmericanaThe Mexican people are now suddenly all over the country kicking the cartels butts , kicking the militarys butt , because these are all just conscripts and drug dealers and corrupt peopleThe people are literally defeating armored vehicles , tanks , the best German weapons made . " <p> But , if these Mormons are so " Americana " why are they in Mexico in the first place ? Answer : because they turned their backs on America when this nation prohibited them from enslaving women via polygamy . They bugged out and dodged the fate of fellow Mormon Warren Jeffs , currently doing hard time for child sexual assault . <p> That 's some Rosetta Stone . <p> At the 00:53:49 mark Jones shouts : <p> " Liberty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And he claims that he is not trying to start a civil war . What BS . <p> I congratulate the Mormons for fighting off the drug cartels , but that hardly makes them The Saviors of Western Civilization as Jones would have it . In fact , the Mexicans Mormons make David Koresh and Warren Jeffs look like choir boys . If you have never heard of Ervil Morrell LeBaron , The Mormon Manson , as in Charles Manson , then you need to watch this Vice report : <p> Conclusion Alex Jones wants to scrub America clean of police , government , and military . He would create an anarchic playground that would come to be dominated by the most heavily-armed cults and militias . He thinks that will lead to a " verdant , luxurious freedom . " But in reality , in Jonestown , you will have MOVE living next to you , and on the other side will be David Koresh drooling over your daughters . Across the street will be Cliven Bundy , and if you object when his cows eat your lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NotesIts Horrible Do n't  watch " America , Wake Up or Waco " you will regret it . Just go to the marks that I point out ; the rest is just blather . <p> The Phoenix The code name for Jones effort to rebuild the Branch Davidian church was " The Phoenix Project . " This is curious because the Phoenix is the mascot of the New World Order , and Jones carved up a United Nations flag with a knife in the film ( at 00:30:40 ) while shouting " Death to The New World Order ! " Click on the photo of the UN Security Counsel chamber below to enlarge it , and then you will see the Phoenix bird in the center of the mural : <p> " UN security council 2005 " by Bernd Untiedt ( Wikimedia Commons ) . <p> So , the nations of the world burn , and the global New World Order government rises from the ashes like a Phoenix . Its probably just a coincidence that Jones has a fondness for this sinister UN mascot . Probably . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ZERO information presented to help us understand who David Koresh and the Branch Davidians were . We are n't  even told what denomination the sect began as ( Protestant ) before devolving into an evil cult of personality . <p> Church , or Satanic Cult ? In the film , there is no iconography visible in the church ; no statues , no altar , no cross . They could have been building a barn for all we know . Weird . And look at Koreshs flag , featuring a serpent : <p> Branch Davidians Flag via Wikipedia . <p> I have no idea what the Branch Davidians are like today . But under David Koresh ? Not what I would call " spiritual . " <p> The Obligatory Big Lie At the 00:29:15 mark Jones repeats his favorite Big Lie and calls the Federal Reserve Bank " a private banking institution that controls our banking system for profit " What does that have to do with the subject of the film ? Nothing whatsoever . Jones just shoehorns it in whenever he opens his mouth . Orders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's suppose that Jones is right when he says that increased gun ownership in his utopia would reduce street crime . That only considers one side of the equation . In a Jonesian regime we have to consider the massive increase in crime among the cult/militia leaders . So , instead of a city having 10 robberies per day , it would have 10 little girls raped per day . Instead of having drive-by shootings , it would have militia gun fights . But those new crimes wont be counted in the crime statistics because your local Messiah wont consider them to be crimes . And if our new Messiahs bring back polygamy , then street crime will go up . Research has shown that single men excluded from reproduction get a bit testy ( see this ) . Polygamy can be studied because it is still legal throughout the Islamic world . I do n't  think Jones advocates polygamy , but his utopia would practically guarantee its return . I would really like to see Jones get detailed about his " Rosetta Stone " so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first long quote above , Jones hails " a return to chivalry , knighthood . " So , there is a royal element in Jones utopia , just as I speculated in Alex Jones , American Royalty .

I 've had us in a broadening pattern on the weekly since early October . <p> VIX daily on lower trendline . Looks ready to explode late this week with significant downside action for the GM next week ( and starting as early as tomorrow ) . Consistent with EWT of being in a motive 3 subwave . Buckle up . <p> Matt , That is not a broadening pattern . It is a flag rising in the opposite direction of trend followed by a breakdown . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy or Edwards and Magee . <p> I started my pattern on December 9th , and if you look at a chart of daily closing prices , you will see that the price pattern has indeed broadened since . The hourly may not look perfect , but I believe that pattern is the best fit . <p> Also , if you are saying that the rise off of the November low is a flag , Magee disagrees with you . From page 199 : <p> " One of our requisites for a dependable Flag ( or Pennant ) was that it should not take more than 4 weeks to complete its pattern and break out in a new move . It stands to reason , therefore , that a true Flag can not show up at all on a monthly chart and barely appears on a weekly chart . You will find price areas on long-range charts , patterns which have taken 8 or 10 weeks to as many months , and sometimes a year or two , in their construction , which assume the shape of a Flag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I 'm saying the flag is from Nov 15 to Jan 6 . It is tilting up and therefore going in the opposite direction of the greater market movement since Oct 97 which is down . When flags tilt up against a downward trend then the market usually breaks down as it did . I just do n't  think that you can ignore the lows along the way between Nov 15th to Jan 6 when showing market broadening . Your bottom line must capture all the major lows instead of jumping over them . A broadening pattern is alike a trumpet blowing to the right , but with all the major lows touching the bottom line of the trumpet and the highs touching the top .

And in this case " continuing " means " down " , as you may have guessed . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 8 thoughts on " SPX Broadening Pattern " <p> Matt , love those patterns . I 've had us in a broadening pattern on the weekly since early October . <p> VIX daily on lower trendline . Looks ready to explode late this week with significant downside action for the GM next week ( and starting as early as tomorrow ) . Consistent with EWT of being in a motive 3 subwave . Buckle up . <p> Matt , That is not a broadening pattern . It is a flag rising in the opposite direction of trend followed by a breakdown . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy or Edwards and Magee . <p> I started my pattern on December 9th , and if you look at a chart of daily closing prices , you will see that the price pattern has indeed broadened since . The hourly may not look perfect , but I believe that pattern is the best fit . <p> Also , if you are saying that the rise off of the November low is a flag , Magee disagrees with you . From page 199 : <p> " One of our requisites for a dependable Flag ( or Pennant ) was that it should not take more than 4 weeks to complete its pattern and break out in a new move . It stands to reason , therefore , that a true Flag can not show up at all on a monthly chart and barely appears on a weekly chart . You will find price areas on long-range charts , patterns which have taken 8 or 10 weeks to as many months , and sometimes a year or two , in their construction , which assume the shape of a Flag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I 'm saying the flag is from Nov 15 to Jan 6 . It is tilting up and therefore going in the opposite direction of the greater market movement since Oct 97 which is down . When flags tilt up against a downward trend then the market usually breaks down as it did . I just do n't  think that you can ignore the lows along the way between Nov 15th to Jan 6 when showing market broadening . Your bottom line must capture all the major lows instead of jumping over them . A broadening pattern is alike a trumpet blowing to the right , but with all the major lows touching the bottom line of the trumpet and the highs touching the top .

Rich investors have probably heard the stories about hedge funds refusing withdrawals ( " gating " ) , especially since Alan Abelson wrote about it in last weeks Barrons .

Sounds reasonable , right ? China is a fast-growing market after all . But this is probably the dumbest strategy possible .

And to this day , only 5% of the cars sold in Japan are imports , as opposed to 52.9% in the USA .

But that is not an accurate statement . As a matter of fact , it is a deceptive statement because the PBOC sets the value of the yuan versus the dollar . Roach is trying to fool us into thinking that the value of the yuan is set by market forces . <p> The fact is that Beijing has been forced by US outrage to fix the yuan higher . We 've made a tiny bit of progress , but Stephan Roach wants to put an end to it . <p> What are we supposed to think when confronted by an economist who argues for " free trade " in everything except the yuan ?

" Deflect attention away from the currency " sounds like a talking point to me ; probably written by some multinational PR flack . <p> Each time the PBOC inches up the yuan-dollar peg , the massive sweatshop profits of the multinationals inch down . <p> Is it impossible to simultaneously pressure the Chinese to float the yuan and open their markets ? Not at all . So , Roachs argument is completely specious . <p> And the Chinese havent strengthened the yuan very much at all in the grand scheme of things .

From what I know , there are no distribution or sales centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am not an apologist for NTBs or for mercantilism as anyone who 's read my posts over the years will attest . Yet the incredulous tenor of your comment about the Japanese attitude towards imports requires , I believe some introspection on your part . The best way to highlight this is a simple anecdote . I used to drive Saab9000 Turbo . It was a nice car , ( and fast ) though perhaps it had too much torque for my adoration . Nonetheless , as I was reading the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitungs tally of imported vehicles into Germany in the presence of my brother-in-law , ( a bona-fide German Herr Doktor PhD , well-travelled and perfectly fluent in French and English , and married to a French Girl ) , I remarked on the article I was reading about auto imports into Germany and how unbelievable it was that Saab had sold ONLY 5,000 vehicles into Germany during the past year ( mid-nineties it was ) . He looked at me quizzically and asked with total seriousness " But Why are you surprised ? ? " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice cars , very well engineered which Germans should appreciate , and Sweden is right next door " . He laughed , and said he was n't surprised , and " continued now derisively saying " we Germans make the best cars . No German in their right mind would buy a Saab if they had a choice " <p> Considering for the most part the average Japanese is similarly proud of their engineering , think Americans in general make shittily-engineered products with no regards for their preferences ( practicality , smaller size , . reliability , and fuel efficiency ) , and that Japanese are mistrustful of foreigners in general , American export performance is hardly surprising . And while there have been and continue to be pecuniary issues and NTBs that exist but are no means insurmountable , the real issue is that the Japanese more than perhaps any other nation prefer to buy Japanese ( with the exception of a few branded luxury goods ) . Importantly , the reason is the same reason Hasidics do business with Hasidics , and shop locally amongst Hasids where possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade practices , but the over-riding reason is preference , NOT obstacle something GM and Ford and Chrysler NEVER learned , and never HAD TO LEARN , because the reality was Japan was a pissy in comparison to the US domestic market a rounding error . <p> At present , the number of global companies surprising to the upside as a result of Chinese ( and other developing nations ) domestic demand suggests that the issues are not identical , and that it is not completely stupid idea . Of course as a mercantilist nation with few scruples , China presents other challenges relating to intellectual property and corporate espionage , and , like the USs Govts own purchasing decisions , an OFFICIAL preference for its own co.s products . Just saying <p> about the reluctance of the Chinese to purchase finished goods from the West , dating to at least the expedition of Lord Macauley in 1792-1793 . Much like the comment from godfree about the Japanese , the Chinese can be expected to favor local products for chauvanistic reasons . There will always be exceptions to these rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like , which are very clear status symbols . But the historical precedent indicates a deeply ingrained preference for national products . <p> As to the other argument that US manufacturers do not tailor products to non-North American consumers , there is some truth to this , but they do a much better job of producing such cars than the anecdotes suggest . <p> For the record , the US auto firms do produce right hand drive cars for many overseas markets . GM however , has done best when it has purchased a local brand and sold its cars under that marque ( Holden in Australia , Vauxhaul in the UK and Opel in Germany ) . Ford sells under its own name , and its European product at least , is first rate ( better than its US product ) . Ford , however , has invested more in small engine/high-output technology than GM has , which is why Fords overseas operations are profitable . Chrysler has never had success outside of North America , which is why it is now in the hands of Fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign consumers . <p> American manufacturers challenges with Asian markets are problems even for the Asians . Do you really think the Japanese are purchasing Hyundais ? Even the Germans produce cars in China under majority-Chinese ownership joint ventures . <p> The US has traditionally competed on scale , and therefore has focused on mass market goods , which is why it has had difficulty with consumer discretionary product sales in Asia exactly the consumer segment that favors local production . What they have learned from their experience is that you have to localize to succeed . In China , they are adopting this strategy . It has risks of its own , and it is certainly not the same as selling under your own brand , but it does get you a piece of the action , at least in the short term . <p> Early 90s Mercs , BMWs and VWs were hardly better , with MB notoriously unreliable . GM ran poor Saab into the ground ( unlike Ford with Volvo which at least tried their best ) . Saab never reached the scale it needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment and possibly forever . The IP was more likely Saabs in the first instance . <p> Anyway , point was local preference ( whether for good or bad reasons like Hasids ) a weak currency ( UNTIL 2009 ) , and idiosyncracies of Japanese culture and language have been far more important factors than official trade barriers in regards to poor US export performance into Japan .

" <p> As a militant protestant , Phelps finds Martin Sheen to be an odious Vatican operative . But why does he call them assassins ? Well , Phelps believes that the Vatican seized dictatorial control of the USA by assassinating John F. Kennedy . He also believes that that the Jesuits assassinated Abraham Lincoln .

Many of the quotes are from Alberto Rivera , an alleged ex-Jesuit who was more likely a simple con man . <p> Of course , if you are a right-wing , protestant redneck , you will probably love Vatican Assassins .

Yes , Adam Weishaupt copied the organizational structure of the Society of Jesus , but it is established fact that the Illuminati and the Jesuits were arch-enemies .

Sheen makes his Vatican-Assassin comment at the 2:42 mark of this interview : <p> It turns out that Vatican Assassins is a book written on an Amish farm in 2001 by white separatist Eric Jon Phelps . The Catholics and Protestants have been publishing propaganda against each other for hundreds of years , and Vatican Assassins is a modern edition of that genre . <p> Phelps believes that WASP culture is responsible for scientific progress and freedom , having broken Western Civilization out of the Dark-Ages death-grip of the authoritarian Catholic Church .

" <p> As a militant protestant , Phelps finds Martin Sheen to be an odious Vatican operative . But why does he call them assassins ? Well , Phelps believes that the Vatican seized dictatorial control of the USA by assassinating John F. Kennedy . He also believes that that the Jesuits assassinated Abraham Lincoln .

Many of the quotes are from Alberto Rivera , an alleged ex-Jesuit who was more likely a simple con man . <p> Of course , if you are a right-wing , protestant redneck , you will probably love Vatican Assassins . But before you believe anything at all in the book , you need to do your own research because the book is simply not credible . <p> The most absurd act that Phelps accuses the Jesuits of is founding the Illuminati . Yes , Adam Weishaupt copied the organizational structure of the Society of Jesus , but it is established fact that the Illuminati and the Jesuits were arch-enemies .

@@88485005 @3985005/ <h> Kudlow Goes Berserk <p> In the video below , you can see Larry Kudlow go berserk on columnist Tim Carney : <p> Is Kudlow really a " Man of the People " as he so vociferously proclaims ? Not hardly . Sure , Kudlow wrote a column supporting the Keystone Pipeline project because it will create blue-collar jobs , but that was obviously a polemic aimed at President Obama . <p> The fact is that you can see Kudlow shouting " UNIONS ARE DESTROYING AMERICA " almost every day on CNBC . Never mind that union membership ( 9% ) in the private sector is lower than it has been in 80 years , Kudlow wo n't rest until it is 0% . <p> But that 's not all . Kudlow supports the two pincers that are wrecking blue-collar America : mass immigration , and free-trade with low-wage nations which has sucked thousands of factories out of the USA . Kudlow also defends the yuan-dollar currency peg that Beijing has imposed on the USA , which turbo-charges H. Ross Perots " giant sucking sound . " <p> Those three policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers trillions of dollars from middle-class workers to plutocrats , and have caused poverty to explode across the USA . <p> This dust-up with Tim Carney began when Kudlow went after Rick Santorums proposal to make manufacturing tax-exempt . And Carney certainly has a point about Kudlow opposing tax breaks that benefit the " small people " . However , its really a non-issue . When it comes time to do the calculations about how much money will be saved when moving a plant from Iowa to Mexico , taxes are just a rounding error . A 0% tax-rate is nothing when you replace $23 per-hour American workers with $2 per-hour Mexicans . <p> But when Kudlow was shouting at Santorum on this issue , Santorum came back and said that supporting manufacturing was important for national defense . And Kudlow scoffed . I spent about a half-hour fighting with CNBC.coms horrible search function , but could n't find the video . But make no mistake , Kudlow scoffed at the idea that manufacturing is important for making war . This is ironic when you consider that Kudlow is a raving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraqi peace dividend on a new war with Iran . <p> A lot of the blue-collar types that Kudlow claims to champion were killed and maimed in Iraq because we did n't  have the manufacturing capacity to make the special super-strong steel needed to harden Humvees against IEDs . And in the conquest of Libya , our French and British allies could n't maintain the tempo because they also lacked manufacturing capacity . <p> Is it really a good idea to turn over all heavy industry to China and Mexico ? Kudlow does n't  seem to have a problem with it . <p> Kudlow also claims to be a Reagan Republican , but contrary to his image , Reagan did n't  actually invade any countries ( not counting Grenada ) . And while Reagan entered the White House as a free-trader , that ideology went right out the window when he saw Japanese auto imports wiping out American jobs on a mass scale . ( That 's what Pat Buchanan sez , and he was there , as was Kudlow . ) <p> Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The cause of the delay is unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or it does n't  know how to manage its supply chain or something else went awry . <p> On the weekly chart , the DI separation looks gigantic , suggesting either a downward move or sideways consolidation ( and what Matt has pointed out a few times from his FDI where are we on that Matt , by the way ? and other posts . The Stochs are getting ready to cross but the MACD has not crossed . Diagnosis : cautiously bullish with danger if support is broken ( 9 MA for example ) or bearish candlestick is formed and confirmed . In EW world , most bullish wavers are saying we are in a wave 4 , which I call Georges Moneymaker . They are corrective waves and are often triangles , so many sharp turns and chances for scalps/plays in both directions . Reading a chart quickly and jumping on the cycle will help you make money in a wave 4 . <p> On the daily chart , I believe the 9 MA is around 33 and the 36 MA is at 30.32 . Well extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking to regroup , but have n't broken 80 yet . The MACD negative histogram is probably the one indicator that says , " take some profits " and get ready to close your position if I deteriorate more . <p> The 60 min indicates that a bounce upwards is coming to me . The DI is bottoming out , price is near the bottom of the BB , with a little bounce the MACD will cross ( albeit in negative groundnot as powerful an indicator ) and the stochs have " reset " to below 20 . I 'm with Georgethe bounce upwards will guide the larger cycles and resolve the indicision . If the 60-min hits the 9 or 36 MA above and fails to penetrate , good news for the bears . If it pops the 9 but fails at the 36 , look for support at the 9 . If it pops them bothmore bull run coming . Again , based upon a wave 4 structurethe pop the 9 , fail at the 36 , retest the 9 , and then break out above the 36 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15 min chart , I see a couple of things NOT pointed out so far . But I agree with the hammers and doji , but let 's look at the structure of the last few sticks and previous sticks : bear flag anyone ? At the start of the last day depicted , the first 4 bars are stretched upwards , yet volume is fallinga poor " handle " in both direction and volume action ( higher prices on higher volume is bullish ) . Followed by consolidation adn then the " warship " plunge . at that point , we 've got a lower high and a lower low made from the high Thursday . a gravestone doji failure to retake the days earlier lows and hold them ( nice bull trap/pattern setup and failure by the pros/GS/prop desks , hehe ) indicates lack of conviction by the bulls . Support found at he 33.25 level ( guessing by eye ) from earlier and another bear flag forms . At this point , I would draw a nice trendline from the highs from Thursday through Friday and find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test of the 36MA overhead . If it breaks the 9 MA just below , *AND* is breaks the support created around $33.25 , then TWM is the place you want to be to make some cash . I 'd " buy " the breakdown in TWM if the UWM gets to $33.20Id actually use the TWM chart to set the price , but since I do n't  have it here , I 'll just infer . <p> Finallythe MACD on the SPX charts are looking to cross into a bearish pattern on the dailies . However , pattern failure has been rampant in this market , so I 'd like some candlestick confirmationsor broken support areas before getting short again . <p> Thanks for reading the novel.love the idea though String of digesting this together . <p> That 's a true statement if one is using a lot of variables to decide trades .

She had losing trades but quickly cut her losses and she just kept following the plan . <p> My problem was always trying to figure out what a stock or the market was going to do next ( i.e. , guessing ) : That 's a sure fire way to lose . When I changed my view to allow the market to *show* me what it was going to do next , using a high probability trading method , it turned my trading around . <p> First and foremost and this is not easy is to trust the indicators one is using .

The book " Why Your World Is About To Get a Whole Lot Smaller " discusses this in detail . Lousy book ( way too hyperbolic with a tinge of conspiracy theory ) about an important message .

I mean those guys get 0% loans , so make cars that last longer .. while Ford/GM etc have to pay Im guessing upwards of 5-6% , so they need high turnover . Its not that Detroit cant make better cars , its their need to be profitable that they make cheaper ones that have high turnover , no ? While Honda can wait 10 years and make more money on one car sold I would think Ford needs to sell twice that number maybe I 'm off here but thought it was interesting . <p> Yes , the " dream " is fading .

So , if you 're exporting , there 's going to be global price setting just like there is in the oil business . Why would these natural gas prices explode ? " <p> But it is n't a world market . Natural gas has never been priced globally like oil because gas is much more difficult to transport . So , if Kudlow is not arguing his case from actual facts , what is he basing his case on ?

On Kudlow , he expressed confusion as to why stocks would rally on Merrill Lynchs disastrous news . MER shareholders were diluted by an astounding 50% by the new stock MER dumped on the market . And this came just a few days after CEO John Thain said everything was cool . Perhaps this can be called " The Last Lie Rally " as the market celebrates the very last lie from the bankers . <p> The Last Write-Down ? But have the bankers really told their last lie ? Jim Cramer says that the market rallied because we finally got a clearing price for all the junk mortgage paper on bank balance sheets : 15-20 cents on the dollar . Banking analyst Meredith Whitney also praised MER for marking to market . But is this true ? If you read any of the stories on this deal , you probably noticed a lot of weird details such as MER loaning 75% of the cost of the paper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that we do n't  have a clearing price after all because this deal was n't a real market-based sale , and I agree .

While true , this misses the point . Short sellers must be silenced precisely because they are telling the truth . The only way to get Larry Kudlows " Summer Rally " going and save the Republican party in November is by having an army of John Thains out there dispensing a tidal wave of BS . <p> Will it Work ? You can see why the stock market has a history of not faltering during an election year . Every time you turn around , Paulson and crew are hatching a new crazy scheme . As Todd Harrison says , they have a mandate to get stock prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . While they can reduce shorting activity , in the end , they cant make you buy stock . And even though the BLS has been creating hundreds of thousands of phantom jobs with their birth/death " adjustments " , enough of the jobs truth is getting out to keep traders from clicking the buy button . And amazingly enough , during the banking panic on July 15th , Bernanke did n't  even deliver a token quarter-point rate cut . So , it does n't  look as if the entire federal bureaucracy is successfully being marshaled to enforce this mandate . <p> Just Another Month-End Rally So , if John Thain is not our savior , then why did the market rally ? I think it can be easily explained as typical month-end window-dressing action . The market closed on Monday leaning short , and the light volume made it easy for the mark-up elves to get a short squeeze going . The elves should pull back and bid underneath Wednesday and Thursday , so while the market is overbought , it may be able to levitate until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June . Lucky for the elves , their work will be done before the jobs report hits on Friday , though they may have to burn through some extra capital if we get another bad unemployment claims number on Thursday . <p> What is Getting Marked-Up ? Have momentum funds piled into financials ? Will they keep them up until the end of the month ? I have n't studied this closely , so if you have ideas , please post in the comments . What I did notice is that the XLE was the only sector to finish in the red on Tuesday . Of course , the big funds began dumping their energy stocks on July 1st , so nobodys trying to mark them up now , and they should continue to be weak . And while KOL and POT finished in the green , they were down in the morning , and floated up on low volume in the afternoon .

You could draw the top line of SPYs triangle at $129 , and that of the Qs at $46 . Both will need to fight up to their top lines soon or face being downgraded to symmetrical triangles . I think the jobs data could easily trigger that downgrade . Also , its important to look at the patterns of leading stocks . As Paul pointed out yesterday , Google has a classic bear-pennant pattern on its daily chart . If this pattern continues to play out in textbook fashion , Google could drop another 70 points . Not good for the Qs or SPY . <p> Jubilation in the Bull Camp There was quite a lot of celebrating in the bull camp Tuesday , and that is rarely a sign of a lasting rally . Lasting rallies are met by skepticism , because skeptical traders have not yet bought in .

However , I do n't  think SPY , XLE , KOL , or POT are going to run away from me , so I will just have to put up with any mark-up action on Wednesday and Thursday . When Junes mark-up action ended , the market opened on huge gap down July 1st . It did rally back , but then rolled over and took out the March low .

The fresh round of interest hikes is likely to prompt a further cutback in vehicle loans and dealer finance . Worse , the credit squeeze may stall capacity expansion plans and the demand skid may lead to production cuts at automobile companies . " <p> The news that Indias auto industry is decelerating is pretty jarring . <p> I suppose that if another bear-market rally were beginning here traders might delude themselves like so : " Yes , the rest of the world is going into recession , but they are lagging the US economy which is just now beginning to rebound .

It is just a matter of time before the gas subsidies in Asia are reduced , crushing demand there as well . <p> I think energy will continue down , but I 'd keep a tight leash on the SPY puts . <p> My latest thoughts : the rally lasts until the end of next week . The FEDs are once again making noise and creating new ways to today to help their banker buddies . The FED deperately wants a strong market next week , so that they do n't  look weak on inflation when they leave the rates the same .

I 've noticed the " L " pattern a few times that indicates that . For example , look at the intra-day chart for XLY on Friday it dropped and then flat-lined to the close .

Little spartan children made sense when the society physically fault like hell . A parent could get in behind seeing their dolls blood dribble . <p> Risk/Reward : See 50% result above . The fighter would have to be paid rather handsomly relative to all major sports for this risk .

While I agree that the UFC does covet boxings popularity , why shouldnt it ? Boxing has been the dominant combat sport across most of the globe for over a century . Its only logical that the UFC would want to grow its own popularity . <p> And let 's not forget that Toney chased Dana White ( the UFC president ) all over the world and talked a whole lot of trash in order to get his shot in the UFC . In other words , it took some arm-twisting by Toney to get this spectacle to happen . It was n't like the UFC went out and looked for this fight ( although the UFC did promote the heck out of it once it was going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you refer to Toney as a dope that trains " for 9 months to the exclusion of the sport they claim to be representing as against MMA .

That strategy would have been even worse than the one he employed ( getting taken down , punched in the face repeatedly , and nearly choked unconscious before quitting ) . <p> MMA might be a hard sell to mothers and fathers . But the beauty of MMA is that most MMA fighters learn and master an individual aspect of MMA ( wrestling , boxing , jiu-jitsu , jumuai thai , etc ) and the natural progression takes them to MMA . It is n't as if most fighters start out training as kids for MMA . <p> Lastly , I 'm not sure where you get your 50% statistic , but I assume you pulled it out of thin air .

Here is the 1987 chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> I trust you know what happened in 2008 <p> I am partial to the 1987 scenario because the US economy is expanding , whereas in 2008 it was contracting very sharply . And the economy has only just begun to create jobs , so we are likely still in the early part of the cycle . <p> But look at the red arrow on the chart . After the 87 crash , there was a test of the low six weeks later . And the climb to a new high took almost two years , though buying dips worked extremely well . <p> So , no SMA crosses on the longer term yet . It sure does n't  look good , but as Matt says : when you 're yellin , you should be sellin ; and when you 're cryin , you should be buyin . I 've got my indicators noted , I hope you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been quite cautious about the short side during most of the " rally " since March 2009 . It was just the opposite during the months leading up to and during the decline of 2008/early 2009 when Matt was quite the bear . You have to respect his thinking about the analogy to 1987 , those dreaming of a retest of 666 might be disappointed with an eventual returns to new highs . <p> Of course , but this just goes to show that the top central bankers can crash the market at any time . Trichets press conference on Thursday morning is what did it . The FOMC has adopted a policy of " no sudden moves " generally only raising or lowering rates in little , tiny steps . But there is still a spike of volatility on FOMC days , even when nothing is said or done because the market is still afraid of their power . Now our markets have learned that they need to tremble just as much when the ECB meets . <p> The ECB did n't  do anything on Thursday , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cant have your central bank adopt a " let it burn " policy as Trichet did . <p> I 'm glad you brought up the VIX Death Cross . That brings up a point about trade execution . <p> Moving averages , MACD , stochastic , Fibs , Elliott Waves and other indicators are often mistaken as a buy or sell signal when used individually . Without confirmation of another indicator or price , it is merely a warning ; a roadmap . <p> The classic head and shoulders on SPY daily that failed on this move up is an example . Sure , its a pattern that has " X " percent of success , but it also has " X " percent of failure . The probability of that pattern ( or signal ) playing out could be high but within itself , it is not a trade signal . <p> I recall reading that " a failed pattern is the most successful " , meaning if the opposite position is taken after a pattern has failed there is a very high rate of success . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play out ? Rather frequently . Why is that ? Because oscillators are restricted to a range in which they must operate . That 's why price can continue moving up while MACD trendlines are moving down on a particular time frame . Their movement is relative to price action within their limited range of volatility . So , once MACD trendlines get above a certain point on a time frame , they are useless . Same goes for stochastic and other indicators . <p> A 1min 9MA cant tell us price is continuing to move higher only a higher time frame or higher MA on that chart can depict that situation . If a 1min 9 MA is being followed , price is continually going above and below that MA . On a higher time frame , price will stay above a 9MA while that 1min is gyrating .

Bottoms may end up being U-shaped instead of V-shaped . <p> We also have to consider the pattern .

That could be what is ahead for us , which would mean the rally could continue . <p> I will say that I have n't been charting that long , but volume is as important as price to most patterns . I 'm about 40% short ( JPM , GS , XRT ) and 20% long ( XLV , JNJ , MSFT ) . <p> Paul , also , if you draw a horizontal line across the chart , we are right at the 3/17 low on the S&amp;P. if we can hold above that level and make a higher low , i think the rally could continue . then again , the mkt is now interpereting bad news as bad news which is a sign that the mkt wants to go lower .

However , its not too difficult to pull the email addresses out of the database . <p> Warning You are going to be putting your hands on the raw data of your website , so be careful ! And make a back-up first . <p> Step 1 Log Onto the Database The first thing that you need to do is get logged into your MySQL database using something like phpMyAdmin . How exactly you do this depends on how your server is configured . You should have received instructions from your hosting company when you signed-up . If you cant find those , contact their support department . <p> Step 2 Run a Query Once you are logged in , you need to find the " SQL " link . That will open a window where you can run " queries " on the database . For example , this query will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Select **28;584;TOOLONG From wpcomments <p> The name of your comments table may be different from wpcomments , so make sure to use the correct name . <p> This query will give a list of commenters showing their name , email address , and the number of comments they have posted : <p> Step 3 Export the Data Once you have the list of email addresses , you need to export them . Below the list , there is a small " export " link . Click that and then phpMyAdmin will take you to a screen where you select a format . Pick the one that will work best for whatever email-sending program you will plug the addresses into . <p> Step 4 Clean the Data Many people who post comments use throw-away email accounts . Sending them mail is almost certainly a waste of time . You cant always tell a fake address , but if it is from a website like mailinator.com , then it is almost certainly fake . Also , you want to remove anybody who has been hostile . Such people will complain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise try to make trouble for you . <p> Another Warning If you have a lot of commenters , be aware that your ISP may become alarmed if you try to email them all at once . They may think that you are a spammer , and shut off your email access . Your ISP may allow you to send a lot of email , but chances are that they will not tell you the exact number since knowledge of that limit helps spammers game the system . You can send your email out in batches over a period of days , or you can open a dial-up account and use it only for sending email . If that account gets closed , it wont be a problem .

@@88485181 @3985181/ <h> Sentiment Sinks , But So Will Market <p> Some measures of investor sentiment have sunk to extreme lows , which in the past has been a good contrary indicator and a buy signal . For example , see the chart of the Investors Intelligence Survey at Bespoke . SentimenTrader.com also publishes its " Dumb Money " index , which is literally 100% reliable . ( If you are not a member , but are a RealMoney.com member , you can see the latest chart here . ) And there are more such indicators . <p> Do not ignore these indicators . They are now a piece in the puzzle and all pieces must fit . <p> So , how does the piece fit ? First , prices are the best indicator of sentiment . If you look at the IWM chart , you will not see any fear , let alone panic . The QQQQ chart is looking shaky , but again , not panicky . The SPY chart looks unpleasant , but also not panicky . Even the XLF chart is not falling off the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if you look at the DJIA chart , you will see impending doom . Of course , the DJIA is a price-weighted index , and means nothing . However , a lot of traders are still in the habit of looking at it , and I suspect it has an out-sized impact on the sentiment surveys . <p> So , some of the negativity is un-justified at this point , and that is proven by the Vix . The DJIA was not scary enough last week to motivate an excess of put buying . Neither the Vix , nor the sentiment indicators , are down to their March lows yet . But they will be . They will be . Historically , the S&amp;P 500 rarely strays far from the banks ; see the chart here . And since the banks are testing the October 2002 low , so will SPY unless " its different this time . " <p> There is room for sentiment to worsen before we get a negative-sentiment rally . See the article here for Ned Daviss opinion : <p> " We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear-cut bullish . " <p> Negative sentiment does n't  just pop-up out of nowhere . In fact , it is negative sentiment that is causing the market to fall here . The wheels are coming off of the banking system and the economy , and the crowd has it right . If you have read The Wisdom of Crowds , you know that groups of ordinary people can perform jaw-dropping feats of computation . Its not a good idea to fight the crowd while it is rational . You can only beat the crowd when it goes crazy , and traders have not reached that point yet . But it is coming , and that would be a good time to take some profits on short positions , and definitely not a good time to press short bets . <p> A few years ago , Laszlo Birinyi published a detailed study of sentiment surveys and found that they are not good timing tools . I think that they are important indicators , but ca n't be used for short-term timing . Birinyi probably agrees that they are important now since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nevertheless , there is a group of traders gearing-up to bet on a negative-sentiment rally this week . One example titled " Brazen and Raw Negativity " comments on the extreme negativity of hedge-fund managers : <p> " Have all of these managers already made their negative bets ? Who is left to sell or short ? " <p> This group of traders trying to fade sentiment will be defeated in the coming week . First , additional short sellers are not needed to push stocks down . All that is needed is for bids to be pulled , and stocks can free-fall . Also , short-sellers are not the only sellers in the market . The public is still sitting on some very nice gains in tech stocks , and Russell-2000 stocks , and they will rush to lock-in profits as soon as the QQQQ and IWM crack . <p> There is also no potential good news coming that will reverse the market . Banks are still white-washing the numbers and plan to continue doing so , the Iranians will not give up their nuclear program , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports may be OK , guidance for the next quarter will almost certainly be reduced for most companies . The Fed is being conspicuous in its silence over plunging bank shares , and unless a giant meteor filled with oil crashes into , and fills the Grand Canyon with light crude , there is no catalyst to spark a rally here . <p> So , all the pieces of the puzzle fit like this : some traders will bet on the sentiment data this week and cause one last rally . It will fail , the market will plunge through the March lows , sentiment will pin-the-needle on the gauges as befits this historic crash , and at the height of the panic , some short sellers will begin to take profits . Their buying will trigger a vicious snap-back that will squeeze the late-coming shorts and burn off all of the negative sentiment . Then the next leg down will begin , and will run until there is some sort of spark-of-life in the economy . <p> I would put some more detail onto the above scenario , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the idea though , right ? <p> A few more notes : <p> Item : Take a look at the QQQQ chart . Notice the sharp , and very high-volume rally on Thursday . I believe that was the " last hurrah " for tech as it could not break-out even with oil falling almost $5 . The chart pattern is now almost identical to that of SPY when I correctly predicted its demise in " Stick a Fork in the SPY " on June 3rd . QQQQ closed under the " third fan line " on Friday ( as I draw the lines ) and IWM is very close to doing the same . <p> Item : Jim Cramer has turned rabidly against financial stocks . While late-to-the-party , he usually arrives in time to make a few bucks . However , he is still in denial about tech , so that is a sign that there are lots of bulls who still have not barfed-up their pet techs . I will likely be adding to my QID position this week . <p> Item : Stick a fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the March low and you will see that XLE has rolled over . NOT good for the S&amp;P 500 . <p> Note : I have some ideas about the Israeli/Iranian situation and will try to post them tomorrow . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 8 thoughts on " Sentiment Sinks , But So Will Market " <p> I accidentally deleted all of your comments on this subject .

I think very few people understand that point , mainly because it is so hard to actually see ( there are no daily or weekly reports of how many yuan are electronically created and lent domestically in China ) , but from what I understand it is a much much higher fraction of China GDP than is being printed here in the U.S. The one element that I do n't  understand about this is a point I keep reading , that is that part of the reason China does this is to maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple conceptual explanation you can offer , that would be most appreciated . <p> Believe it or not , China spends a stupendous 10% of its GDP to keep its currency cheap against the dollar . They keep the yuan pegged to the dollar so that the price of their exports remain the same in the USA . <p> Under free-market conditions , the yuan would strengthen as their economy advanced . That 's what has happened to Brazils currency as its economy has grown . But the Chinese do n't  want a stronger currency because they want to maintain their massive trade surplus with us . <p> So , they intervene in the free market for currencies . If the yuan appreciates , they print more , go into the FX market and buy up dollars . That pushes the dollar back , the yuan back down , and their factories keep exporting to us at the same rate .

@@88485183 @3985183/ <h> Qs Wont Quit <p> On Friday , Dave pointed out that the QQQQ was holding up better than SPY , IWM , and XLF , all of which sustained serious technical damage to their charts last week . During Fridays selling , volume picked up for SPY , but declined for QQQQ . The TRIN was a panicky 2.52 on the NYSE , but the TRINQ was a ho-hum 1.08 on the NASDAQ . <p> The big question is : are the Qs holding up the market , or are they just the last sector to panic ? <p> If the economy were expanding , I would be more interested in the long side here with the NYSE oversold short-term . But the economy is nose-diving , and as we saw so many times in 2008 , oversold conditions ca n't be counted upon to deliver a bounce . <p> And the Qs are not without chinks in their armor . Take a look at this chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> Thursday afternoon and Friday morning saw the Qs trying to regain their breakout level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the process , failed to fill any of the break-away gap created on Wednesday morning ( green box ) . That 's very bearish . <p> On Friday , the Qs closed at 30.08 , which is just below the minor support area around 30.10 ( purple line . ) That level was resistance at the two red arrows , and support at the green arrow . That failure hints that a trip down to test the uptrend line ( blue ) is in the cards . <p> SPY made a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on Friday , which may develop into a three outside down pattern . <p> So , a potential scenario is for the market to fall further Monday morning , and perhaps hold or bounce when the Qs hit the blue line .

However , back then , Dick Fuld gave the market a push on September 15th when Lehman blew up . And two weeks later , voters instructed their congressional representatives to crash the stock market during the first TARP vote . So , I 'm thinking that if the market is going to roll over here , it may not do so quite as dramatically as it did during the crash . <p> We still have the Obama coronation looming , but that is balanced by Barney Frank and the feds getting tough with the banks feeding at the public trough . <p> I am relaxing in cash at the moment .

That 's what has happened to Brazils currency as its economy has grown . But the Chinese do n't  want a stronger currency because they want to maintain their massive trade surplus with us . <p> So , they intervene in the free market for currencies . If the yuan appreciates , they print more , go into the FX market and buy up dollars . That pushes the dollar back , the yuan back down , and their factories keep exporting to us at the same rate .

@@88485215 @3985215/ <h> Shark Tank Tones Down Anti-Americanism <p> If you have never seen ABCs Shark Tank show , here is what it is : entrepreneurs come on and pitch their business propositions to the " sharks " five investors , the most famous of which is Mark Cuban . If the sharks like a business , they negotiate a deal with the entrepreneur . <p> When I first started watching this show , I was jarred by how the sharks insisted that production be done in China . Of course , I knew that sort of thing was going on , that venture capitalists had been asking entrepreneurs about their " China strategy " for many years now . But to see it on TV made it more real . <p> So , if a patriotic American came on the show and said that she wanted to manufacture her product in the USA , the sharks would not invest , and would make a lot of negative remarks about how being patriotic is " closed minded , " foolish , etc . <p> One such patriotic American was Donny McCall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks in the USA . The sharks wanted nothing to do with him . That was on February 24 , 2012 ( episode #2 of season #3 ) . <p> In recent episodes , I had noticed that the show had toned down its anti-American rhetoric , and I thought : " aha , just like Walmart and Apple paying lip service to creating jobs in the USA . " Then on February 15 , 2013 ( episode #16 of season #4 ) , Shark Tank did an update on Donny McCall , who is now manufacturing his product in Iowa . Its too early to tell if the product will be a success or not . <p> So , the moral of the story is that the sharks were wrong , right ? Not so fast . Keep in mind that nothing has changed . The deck is still stacked in favor of China . The yuan is still pegged to the dollar , there are no protective tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing , etc . <p> Even worse , if Invis-A-Rack is a success , Mr. McCall might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering to buy him out , or face having his product knocked-off , and made in China for a fraction of the cost . That happens . A Chinese man will literally knock on your door , and he will bring with him a sample of the product so that you can see that he is not joking and that the quality is comparable . <p> Or a large retailer will help a competitor set up in China . American retailers have a long history of undermining domestic manufacturing companies . Or maybe one of the sharks will go into business against McCall . <p> This , by the way , is the reason why bringing in " magical " immigrant entrepreneurs to create jobs for us knucklehead Americans has not worked , and will not ever work . It does n't  matter who you are because when you go to raise investment capital , you will be asked the same question that the sharks asked McCall : " What is your China strategy ? " <p> So , the moral of the story is : do n't  hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should hate the architects of the game such as David Rockefeller , and Walmart , which campaigned hard for NAFTA , etc . We should also hate the players that uphold the game , and seek to perpetuate it . <p> If all of your competitors are undercutting you by manufacturing in China , by all means , move your plant to China and compete with them . But your political position should support policies that re-stack the deck in the USAs favor so that you can one day bring your factory home . <p> And one last thing about Shark Tank : in the intro to the show , they describe shark Robert Herjavec as " the son of an immigrant factory worker . " They do n't  say " mere factory worker " but it still rubs me the wrong way . As if his father was a liability because he was a blue-collar worker . It strikes me as condescending , and even insulting to a man whom I 'm sure worked very hard to give his son every advantage within his power to give . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are feeling the need to pay lip-service to creating jobs in the USA , because that is most-certainly not our policy today .

@@88485217 @3985217/ <h> L. Fletcher Prouty <p> U.S. Air Force Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty will probably be remembered by history as one of the architects of the secret government . His job at the Pentagon was to provide the CIA with the military resources needed to carry out its clandestine operations . Prouty created a secret network of agents throughout the military , government agencies such as the FBI and FAA , and foreign governments . <p> Originally , all of this work was legitimate as part of US Cold War policy . And Prouty did in fact turn down CIA requests when they had not been previously approved by the National Security Council . But it was n't long before the monster that Prouty helped to build took on a life of its own . <p> Proutys first book , " The Secret Team : The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World " is available to read for free on this website . His second book , " JFK : The CIA , Vietnam , and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You will also find plenty of interesting things to read on www.prouty.org . My favorite page on the site is the one with the JFK assassination pictures ( click the " Photos " link on the left ) . Prouty believed that Air Force General Ed Lansdale was the mastermind of the assassination . Lansdale was actually the CIAs top " regime changer " and was only covered as an Air Force man . For example , in 1955 Lansdale installed Ngo Dinh Diem as dictator of South Vietnam for the CIA . <p> Prouty worked closely with Lansdale in the Pentagon for years , but Prouty was also a pilot . He flew many clandestine missions , some of which included Lansdale and his team . While Prouty has his critics , he was in fact a practitioner . He was there . He knew where the bodies were buried . Literally . His version of this part of the USAs history must be taken seriously . <p> Lee Harvey Oswald Prouty , not being a trained scholar , was frequently reckless with facts while striving to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Harvey Oswald was just a patsy , Prouty wrote on page 308 of his " JFK " book that at the time of the assassination Oswald : <p> " was a nondescript twenty-four year-old ex-marine who was unknown to almost everyone . There is no way one can believe that these press agencies had in their files , ready on call , all of the detailed information that was so quickly poured out in those first hours after the assassination . " <p> In reality , Oswald was a rather notorious traitor for having defected to the Soviet Union . While he was in Moscow , American reporters interviewed him and the American press published stories on him . Not only did the media have plenty of information in their files , but Oswald was watched by several intelligence agencies , including the CIA and FBI , who had mounds of information about Oswald . <p> This does n't  disprove Proutys assertion that Oswald was a patsy , but it does open Prouty up to criticism . Lansdale had sent Prouty off to Antarctica , literally , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . So , when reading Prouty , I trust his description of events that he participated in , but google assertions such as the one above to see if they can be verified . <p> Soft on Communism ? Prouty has been criticized for being soft on communism and maybe even a sympathizer . And it is true that Prouty barely even mentioned communism . One of the reasons for this is that the USA and Soviet Union were close allies during World War Two and Prouty did n't  see any reason whey the two nations should immediately become enemies . He also flew missions over Russia and saw first-hand the devastation caused by the war . He did n't  think that the Russians were in any kind of condition to launch a war against the USA . <p> Furthermore , at he very bedrock of Proutys criticism of the CIA is his assertion that the CIAs special forces doctrine was based upon Maos Little Red Book . So , the CIA-trained Green Berets who were sent into Vietnam had been trained to believe that setting up a dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exporting dictatorship " doctrine was implemented all over the world , and I doubt that many Americans are proud of it . <p> Prouty also did not believe that wars such as Vietnam were fought for ideological reasons , but to make profits for the military-industrial complex , and to capture markets for Corporate America . " Fighting Communism " was just a cover story . <p> Vietnam Compared to World War Two , the history of the Vietnam War seems all fuzzy and blurry . What exactly was the problem there ? Proutys take is very interesting : it was a CIA project to help the military-industrial complex make a lot of money . CIA puppet Diem expelled the " imperialist " Frenchmen who were operating the criminal-justice system in South Vietnam . That left the villages with no police or courts . Then Diem expelled the " communist " Chinese merchants who were just there to buy rice . That destroyed the economy of the villages . The previously prosperous peasants suddenly had no way to market their crops , and no money to by necessities such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA designated them " communists " and Huey helicopter gunships were sent in to slaughter them . <p> It is also interesting that the most intense " communist activity " took place in the southern part of the country . You would think that the hot spot would have been up north , with guerrillas sneaking across the border from North Vietnam . Prouty explains this mystery : After World War Two ended , CIA transport aircraft , along with US Navy ships , relocated very large numbers of peasants from North Vietnam to the southern part of South Vietnam . They became bandits too . Prouty says that CIA " psychological warfare specialists " ( a.k.a. terrorists ) were deployed to North Vietnam to " inspire " this mass migration . Once a large number of refugees were introduced , and the economy smashed , South Vietnam was set up to make fat profits for American defense contractors . <p> The Cabal Prouty asserts that there is a grand cabal that commands governments of the world . While he has been criticized for this , he is only using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly about the cabal in private conversation during World War Two . That was before President Dwight Eisenhower made his military-industrial complex speech . Notice that Eisenhower gave that warning during his farewell speech at the end of his presidency . Perhaps Eisenhower knew what he was dealing with better than the next president , JFK , who vowed to " break the CIA into a million pieces " while still in office . <p> Ancient History ? Perhaps you are thinking that this is all ancient history ? But take a look at this video where former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura states that he was grilled by CIA agents in 1998 . What did he do wrong ? He was elected by the people of Minnesota . Apparently , the CIA still frowns upon democracy . <p> More on the Cabal Churchill is said to have received loans from the Rothchild banking family , so perhaps they are who he had in mind when complaining about the cabal .

First National Bank of Boston then financed Textrons takeover of Bell Helicopter and made a fortune selling choppers to the CIA . Says Prouty : <p> One year earlier , in 1959 , Frank Hand had directed a Boston banker to my office . At that time I worked in the Directorate of Plans in Air Force headquarters and my work was top secret . Few of my contemporaries in the Pentagon knew that I was in charge of a global U.S. Air Force system created for the dual purpose of providing Air Force support for the CIA and for protecting the best interests of the USAF while performing that task .

Ridiculous , and maybe even certifiable . <h> Kass Takes On Whitney <p> Doug Kass , who made big money shorting financials , and is now calling a bottom , is claiming to be a better banking analyst than Meredith Whitney . Last week , in the Columnist Conversation area of RealMoney.com , Kass dismissed Whitney as a former , mere underling , and said that he had " better spreadsheets " . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneering remark about Whitney . <p> The fact that bulls like Cramer and Kass are already cheering indicates that this dead-cat bounce in the financials is likely nearing completion . The birth of a lasting rally is met by skepticism , not jubilation in the bull camp . <h> A Hostile Fed <p> The market bottomed in March because the Fed saved the world , and the bankers were able to sell a " the worst is behind us " theme . This time around , financials are faced with a potentially hostile Fed that might raise interest rates , and what kind of idiot would believe a banker today ? The level of lies that has come out of firms like Lehman and AIG couldnt have been written by Stephen King . This is not the stuff of which bottoms are made . <p> " On June 3 , the Fed released a copy of a notice it issued to Millennium Bankshares Corp . in Reston , Va. , in which it told the bank that it shall " not declare or pay any dividends without the prior written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I can just hear an underling telling the boss : " Sir , Chairman Bernanke just sent as note telling us to stop being stupid . " <p> All jokes aside , this is important because maintaining dividends is one of the ways banks pretend like nothing is wrong . It will not be good for share prices . <p> It looks like the poor Consumer Sentiment report on Friday has taken a lot of air out of the possibility that the Fed will raise rates any time soon . However , David Merkel proposes another possibility : that the Fed will hike , and then quickly take it back after the ensuing mayhem . <p> Bernanke may be doing an imitation of Paul Volcker right now because Volcker is part of Team Obama , and Bernanke might not want to get " CHANGED " when Obama appoints the next Fed Head . Do n't  forget that it was a Democrat ( Jimmy Carter ) who first appointed Volcker . <p> So , even though raising rates here would be crazy from an economic perspective , it might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits last week on rumors of a Lehman take-over , any such deal is very unlikely to get the Bear-Sterns treatment from the Fed . All signs point to the Fed blessing another leg down for the banks , and a strong possibility that they will " make an example " out of a firm to send a message to the rest of the industry : This is n't Japan ; there will be a workout . <h> The MACD Divergence <p> If you put a MACD onto the XLF chart , you will see that there is a divergence between last weeks low and the March low . This means that there was less selling pressure last week and would normally forecast a lasting turn . However , no indicator is perfect and I think this is one time that MACD and other similar indicators will fail . <p> The XLF is back down where it is due to a continuation of bad news coming out of financials . In March , it got down here on rather dramatic levels of sheer panic . You would think that the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not . Its very presence at the March lows without a panic is very telling . So , I think prices got pushed down excessively in March and created an artificially low MACD reading . <h> The XLF Chart <p> Notice the blue down-trend line on the XLF chart below ( click to enlarge ) . The line is very well established , having rejected prices at several points : <p> The XLF will have to contend with that overhead resistance very soon . Now look at the three sets of parallel green lines that bound the three throw-back rallies . <p> The top-most throw-back rally was a classic " bear flag " pattern . The second and third throw-backs have been sharper due to more shorts building up and then being burned off . <p> Last weeks trading had higher volume which might indicate a selling crescendo . ( If you have ideas about the volume pattern , please post in the comments . ) However , I do n't  think we will get a crescendo bottom here because of the dramatic drop-off in volume on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak shorts getting squeezed out , and no large funds are accumulating financial shares here . <p> Also , if the XLF were to hold here , the chart pattern would change to a rectangle a type of pattern that is rare in bear markets . If the economy were actually recovering , I would consider that a possibility . But the economy is continuing to weaken , and bear-market rallies aside , stocks are likely to fall until some signs of life are seen . Do n't  be fooled by the positive GDP numbers , which are not properly deflated . <h> More Points <p> Jimmy Rodgers said recently on Bloomberg that he is short the iBanks because banks go to $8 a share during a housing recession . So , it is Rodgers and Whitney versus Kass and Cramer . I am betting on Team Whitney . <h> The Market in General <p> The S&amp;P 500 has snapped back pretty hard off of its oversold condition last week , and another strong rally could have it over-bought a lot faster than anybody is currently expecting . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Monday . This just might be the last opportunity for a good entry point before the next big whoosh down . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 6 thoughts on " No Bottom for XLF " <p> 1 . I do n't  cheerlead I analyze . My analysis is sometimes right and sometimes wrong- unlike your convicted " no chance " that XLF can rally . 2 . I have been short financials for two years before going long . 3 . I believe my spreadsheets on Citigroup are more accurate that Meredith Whitneys . I did not " sneer " at her work . 4 . I do n't  believe C will cut its dividend rather cashflows ( using reasonable assumptions ) suggest that C can modestly RAISE its dividend in 2009 and 2010 . By contrast Meredith thinks C will eliminate its dividend . 5 . Your rationale against the banks seems to be totally based on technical analysis which is not my approach ( mine is fundamental ) . 6 . Ad hominem attacks , like yours on myself and Cramer are inexcusable and show little class . 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rally . In fact , in my last paragraph I said that I was looking for the rally to continue and am planning to short into it . I did say that the support will not hold though , and maybe I am " convicted " as you say , but with the wheels coming off of the economy and the banking system , I am sleeping soundly at night .

I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't find it ( though the RM search thing is pretty horrible ) . Did you take the comment down ? Not there 's anything wrong with that . Also , I am curious as to why any fundamental analyst would trust the data being put out by financial companies these days . These firms have been telling some tall tales , no ? <p> 4 ) Yes , I understand that your view is at odds with Whitneys . I wish you luck with C , but I think there are lots easier ways to make money in a bear market that features a smoking crater where the banking system used to be . <p> 5 ) I have made an absurdly huge return recently using my technical analysis . I correctly predicted , and bet heavily upon , the demise of this recent bear-market rally . <p> 6 ) Ad hominem ? Did Cramer not recommend SHLD and GS at their peaks ? Do you have a profit on your C position ? However , I did play back your mention of Whitney on Kudlow Friday night ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneering or derisive , so I apologize for that , but you were criticizing her . You cant deny that you have been taking her on , right ? <p> All kidding aside , Kass is an ace short-seller , and will wind up thriving in this bear market eventually .

I looked at his chart and his call . Assuming he s right , that the Fed will cause a bond bubble to keep yields and mortgage rates low , why would such a bubble have disastrous consequences ? We know that bonds have been in a long-term bull for 30 years , and this would send them higher , but how far would they fall , and how would that affect the real economy ? Is it the sudden rise in interest rates ? I see this argument being made , but I 'd love to understand the longer term thinking .

Sorry about that . You 're right about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's poor , and there 's poor ; ) <p> I guess my thought is this . So what happens with a severe dollar collapse ( i.e. what a bond collapse would produce ) ? In the short term , it would be disastrous , as it would hike inflation for imported goods . Commodities and precious metals go higher . How much higher ? I do n't  know . I 'd take a stab at $1200 for gold . I think people thinking its going to hit $2000 are dreaming . Thats hyperinflation territory that would most likely bring on Federal action . <p> Longer-term , a controlled , measured , inflation , though , would be the prerequisite for a rebalancing of global tradeand that 's what has produced this financial crisis in the first place , right ? I 'm referring to the tremendous foreign dollar reserves that produced the cheap-money economy . Inflation is also a pre-requisite to paying off the deficit .

If anyone has any other ideas about how well pay our debts , I 'd like to hear them . <p> Yerk , first of all let 's assume that all CBs follow FED like a shadow . <p> Secondly , let 's stay at the lower level of the pyramid ( for this discussion ) where we touch upon real people and their actions . <p> According to Chicago School ( Fisher ) there will be no inflation , due to the low velocity of money . As such , the doubling of the monetary base has no impact and we are moving into a deflationary spiral . <p> The Keynesians argument also says deflation due to the output gap between actual and potential GDP. <p> Mish also calls for deflation as the amount of available credit is shrinking rapidly . Most Austrians agree with him on the dire prospects for any renewed growth . ( At least in real terms ) . They might disagree with him on inflation/deflation . <p> So then we have to go back to von Mises . He said look at the Monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Base will give a bust of the boom ( Bernanke in 2007/08 ) . <p> According to von Mises we should now experience inflation . Money printed will be money spent . <p> I think the main difference here is that the other camps think in aggregate , while von Mises said you need to look at the people who receive the money first . What do they do with the money ? <p> Do Banks need to lend to make money ? Yes . <p> Will the 5-10% of population who gets money/cheaper credit through changes of FED/Govt policy start to spend the money ? I think yes . <p> This is my interpretation of the theory of the different schools . I might be wrong . <p> Yerk , You do n't  have to worry about inflation .

The waves and minutes just are not registering . Could yall do an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count comments ? , and tell me which way the waves are moving . Is the tide going out or coming in . How do we know when these waves reverse , and are we talking daily time frames or shorter charts . I still have an aversion to this because of that Doc finger wave thing I cant get out of my mind , but I am trying . <p> EWT is *not* easy to figure out , because commonly there are TWO or more " counts " that are valid . When they LINE UP together , that is when the money is made by the Brinks truckful . <p> The primer is simple , but the application to trading is tricky . <p> Waves come in two flavors : impulsive or corrective . Impulsive waves typically come in a group of 5 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 with 1 , 3 , 5 going either up or down and the 2 and 4 waves counter that trend . After those 5 waves are complete , there is usually a group of corrective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . A and C go in the same direction , B counters that trend or sometimes just consolidates in a flat pattern . <p> Waves occur in ALL time frames , from the 1 min chart ( hard to discern , but when you see them thereit is really cool ) up to a century or millenium . The smaller waves make up the movements of the larger waves . That is why we refer to wave i of ( 3 ) of 1 of P1 type of thing . We are going from smaller wave label to bigger wave label . In that example , P1 ( Primary wave 1 ) is going UP or DOWN ( bull or bear ) . Wave 1 is the first sub wave of 5 that will make up P1 . That wave 1 will break down into 5 waves , and we use symbols or parenthesis to distinguish them from the others , and finally roman numerals , etc <p> I believe we have finsihed 5 waves up from the 666 low and are entering a corrective ABC period from 1220 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A and B. A went down , B went up , C is headed lower . A ended at the Flash Crash . B ended at 1173 ( remember how we were looking for that ? ) , and wave 1 started down from 1173 . Technically , if 1174 is taken out to the upside , my count has problems and is probably wrong . There is room for interpretation , but I am expecting some version of a wave 2 to exist from the 1100 bounce today upwards . Using Fibs , as JG pointed out , we went from 1173 to 1100 , or 1149 to 1100 depending upon HOW you are counting it . Fibs from 1100 to 1149 will end things near 1119 ( how convenient near the EOD , huh ? ) , 1125 , or 1131 . If you are using Fibs from 1173 to 1100 , there is more room to the upside from here to the 1128 , 1136 , or 1145 levels . That is n't EWT , that is basic TA , but labeling a wave helps ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helps you . <p> oh yeah , we are probably in the early stages of a C wave . Waves 1 , 3 , and 5 ( of C ) will be headed down . Waves 2 and 4 are heading up . We are just dissecting the waves further to look for market movement . It looks like an a wave up from 1100 to 1118 to me this afternoon , a b wave flattening and broadening out ( a megaphone or expanding triangle pattern ) that is n't quite complete , followed by an EXPECTED up wave c that can end at any of those Fib levels or a squeak above 1119.03 and be a valid wave count . <p> Given that BAD primerwhen was 1220 ?

It has not stimulated the economy because the banks have not increased lending . In fact , they have decreased lending and the money supply has not expanded . <p> So , the moral of the story here is that the Fed does not expand money and credit .

You buy a batch of slaves , and put them to work growing cotton . One day , while they are out in the fields , you take a look in their shacks . You see a bunch of weird religious artifacts .

The Fed " stimulus " is doing nothing because the banking system is broken ! <p> Note : Laffer cited the monetary base , and I use the True Money Supply , but it is the same difference . <p> Everybody knows that the tax-rebate checks provide only a temporary boost for retailers and create no jobs .

Deep in the money SPX calls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money OEX puts and calls move about $50 for every SPX point . And if you day trade , you should take a close look at the S&amp;P 500 e-miniit moves $50 for every S&amp;P 500 point and many brokers only require $500 marginbut you must close your position X number of minutes prior to market close at 4PM .

Back on June 9th , I predicted that the rate cuts would do nothing for the economy in a post titled " Bernanke Shoots Blanks " . <p> On Friday , my meme made it to Kudlow . At about 8 minutes into the show , economist Arthur Laffer ( inventor of The Laffer Curve ) , made the same points that I made . Here is one of his quotes when Kudlow tried to counter with the Feds loaning of treasuries to banks : <p> " that does n't  expand the ability of member banks to make loans . " <p> Exactly ! The Fed " stimulus " is doing nothing because the banking system is broken ! <p> Note : Laffer cited the monetary base , and I use the True Money Supply , but it is the same difference . <p> Everybody knows that the tax-rebate checks provide only a temporary boost for retailers and create no jobs .

Anything they do at this point is merely symbolic . They could raise rates to 5% or lower them to 0% and it would make no difference . Banks are not lending ; the economy is contracting , that can not be changed . The price of oil makes little difference at this point . The viscous cycle of contraction must run its course . <p> Dressguard , I thought that the meme was more important then Kudlows idiocy .

I know rising prices are a bigger problem in Europe now , but I think the logic is roughly the same : raising rates during a recession is not a good idea . <p> ECB is heavily influenced by German monetary politics . As Germany lost twice everything in recessions they will hike rates . There was actually an article in Germany about this issue this weekend . ( Unfortunately its only in LONG ...

Larry Kudlow is " in the loop " of the powers that control American trade policy , and his opinions are an accurate reflection of how you can expect to be treated . <p> When you see them getting away with this sort of thing , its pretty clear that China already has it locked up . <p> Twenty years ago , the article you cited would have been about Japan .

We have 41 million people on food-stamps right now . Those people probably do n't  have any choice but to buy the cheapest products available . <p> Also , if you were to follow a strict Buy-American policy , you would have to do without many items such as TVs , computers , cell phones , and clothes .

However , there are things that CAN be purchased with a Made in USA tag or label on them and the People of the USA need to start looking at labels and making a choice : do I NEED this product , or can I avoid buying this item that was n't made in the USA ?

But are such " socialite " spies really harmless ? <p> Consider one such spy : George de Mohrenschildt . In 1962 , he knocked on the door of US Navy Admiral Henry C. Bruton and told Brutons wife that a friend of his used to own their house . He became a friend of the family , and spent a good deal of time visiting . One day he brought a friend with him . You may have heard of him : Lee Harvey Oswald . <p> As you probably know , Oswald was not a " socialite " type of spy . He was more of a " shoot you in the head " type . Oswald did n't  assassinate Admiral Bruton , and did n't  pursue the contact to see what intel he could acquire for the KGB . However , this story gives a good example of how Russian socialite spies may operate : they provide contacts and logistical support for the hard-core spies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Kennedy , de Mohrenschildt may have provided Oswald with a better rifle than the $20 piece of junk that Oswald bought himself . Or de Mohrenschildt may have assisted Oswald with a better escape plan than hopping onto a city bus as Oswald did . <p> And the FSB ( formerly the KGB ) is not done assassinating people . While they are not likely to shoot you in the head these days , they are not above injecting you with a bit of plutonium as they did to Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 . Did socialite spies in London assist with that assassination ? Its a very good possibility . <p> Note : the dose of polonium-210 that killed Litvinenko probably cost $2-$3 million , and it is normally used to trigger nuclear bombs . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 3 thoughts on " Socialite Spies " <p> George , It was safe here during World War IIIt will be safe during the riots that are coming .

This is well beyond , I think , what the Congress ought to be doing . " <p> That 's an amazing statement , and I 'll bet Boehner would not repeat it if he could take it back . Currency exchange rates are an integral part of trade policy . As a matter of fact , we had the same problem with Japan in the 1980s as we do now with China . Back then , during the RONALD REAGAN administration , we put the smack down on the Japanese and forced the value of the yen up dramatically with the Plaza Accord . <p> We should have done the same thing with the Chinese long ago .

@@88485403 @3985403/ <h> Trading the Triangle Day 3 <p> Light volume on down-days and heavy volume on up-days is the textbook pattern for a healthy ascending triangle , and that is exactly what we had last week . <p> Friday afternoon , SPY began to rally , but the shorts had been holding their fire and struck 15 minutes before the close . They waited until the last minute of a summer Friday afternoon to try and catch the longs asleep . However , the longs were on the job and were able to hold SPY above the strategic intra-day low from the March 17 bottom at $126.07 . The battle raged into the after-market , but the longs were able to close SPY at $126.23 . That action must be considered a successful pull-back test . <p> After Fridays failed raid , I think the shorts will give up . If they could n't knock the market down last week during the tidal wave of bad news , when will they ? SPY could break out of its triangle on Monday if I am right . SPY is also short-term oversold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The market likes to flatten out ahead of FOMC meetings , so maybe SPY will rally on Monday , and then go sideways Tuesday morning . Nobody expects the FOMC to do anything substantial , so I believe that this meeting will be inconsequential . <p> The IWM has been very strong , but take a look at its ascending triangle ( click to enlarge ) : <p> IWM has two problems . First , it is moving into the apex of the triangle , and the further it goes , the less powerful its breakout should be , according to the textbook . Second , the pink line overhead is the downtrend line from the October high . So , if IWM breaks out , it does n't  have a lot of room to run before hitting resistance . <p> While IWM has been stronger than SPY recently , SPY is much farther beneath its primary downtrend line and could outperform IWM going forward . <p> Here is the QQQQ chart ( click to enlarge ) : <p> While the Qs look more range-bound-ish , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the July bottom . After all , companies like Apple have billions of dollars in the bank and will hardly be in need of bailing out like the banks , automakers , airlines , etc . The Qs lower trendline ( black ) is rising , and like SPY , the Qs are far below their primary trendline , and should be able to run higher than IWM . <p> As Rev Shark pointed out on RealMoney.com on Friday , the IWM has a heavier weighting of banks than SPY does , so that goes a long way in explaining its recent out-performance . With small banks continuing to fail while large ones are being protected by the federal government , perhaps IWMs rally will be the first to top out . <p> Note : While I am still bearish on the economy , I am not opposed to playing a bear-market rally from the long side , and have a small SPY call option trade on just for fun .

@@88485420 @3985420/ <h> A Globalist Waterloo <p> Is President Obama about to trigger a revolution that will put an end to the globalist campaign to eradicate the American middle class ? There has been very little news coverage of the presidents new initiative to replace American truckers with Mexican drivers . After all , such things are not proper topics of conversation in polite globalist society , but this is a potentially explosive issue . <p> There has been wrangling over Mexican truckers since NAFTA went into effect in 1994 with no political fallout . So , you might be thinking that it is a non-issue . But things are different now . We have 43 million people on food stamps and a massive unemployment problem . And that is a powder keg just waiting for a spark . <p> Of course , Americans workers have barely objected to being replaced by foreigners . As we speak , information-technology ( IT ) workers at Xerox are docilely training their Indian replacements . Perhaps they are content with their severance packages , which must be very generous considering the hit to 4Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react the same way ? Suppose a CEO of a trucking company sauntered into a Teamsters meeting , lighted a cigar with a flaming $100 bill , and announced : <p> " Listen up boys . Your Mexican replacements are waiting outside . You will teach them how to drive your rigs , and then you will be fired . The Mexicans will work for $2 per hour and I will purchase another Learjet while you feed your children with food stamps . " <p> Would the CEO get out of the room alive ? And where might that cigar end up ? <p> Of course , it would n't happen that way . Mexican trucking companies would be allowed to operate in the USA . American companies would lose market share and steadily lay off drivers . But you get the idea . <p> We know from history that truckers are much different from IT workers , call-center operators , and factory workers . Remember the New York Daily News strike back in the 1990s ? There were over 500 incidents of violence , including many bombings of delivery trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3.4 million truckers in the USA . <p> And that 's why this particular part of NAFTA has never been implemented . President Obama could order it into effect right now . But he s afraid , just like presidents Bush and Clinton were . But that does n't  mean that Obama wont go through with the pogrom . It only means that he will make sure that he wo n't take all the blame if things get ugly . So , he will seek to line up political allies , and leave the dirty work to his new chief of staff , Bill Daley . <p> It is Daleys appointment that indicates how determined Obama is on this issue . Daley worked for President Clinton and helped to ram NAFTA through Congress in the first place . <p> Obama is getting pressure from farmers because Mexico has put retaliatory tariffs on US food exports , so this is a farmers vs. truckers battle . However , Obama will have support from the big companies because eradicating the truckers will be seen as the next driver ( ha , ha ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers with foreigners is , after all , our official national business model . <p> And it is n't going to be changed unless the American people insist . Its like the Vietnam War ; it might still be going on today , enriching the military-industrial complex , if Americans had n't  taken to the streets to put an end to it . And it did n't  really take that much resistance . A few burned draft cards , a few hippies shot at Kent State . It was n't really a revolution , but an intensification of our democratic process . <p> So , will the Teamsters strike ? Will they fight ? They certainly have in the past , and they are probably very angry right now . They had been Republican allies , but supported Obamas campaign , and they must feel betrayed now . <p> On the the other hand , American truck drivers are an aging population . Maybe they do n't  have much fight left in them , and can be bought out just like those IT workers at Xerox . <p> The trucking industry says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen empty shelves at your grocery store ? No , you have not . There may be a shortage of truckers willing to work for peanuts , or maybe the trucking companies are just trying to scam some more " training " dollars out of the Department of Transportation , but I 'm pretty sure that we do n't  need Mexicans to drive our trucks . <p> I do n't  now how this will play out . But I do think that we might be approaching the limits of the American peoples tolerance for " free trade " induced poverty , and I think that Obama would be wise not to push that limit .

@@88485433 @3985433/ <h> A Globalist Waterloo <p> Is President Obama about to trigger a revolution that will put an end to the globalist campaign to eradicate the American middle class ? There has been very little news coverage of the presidents new initiative to replace American truckers with Mexican drivers . After all , such things are not proper topics of conversation in polite globalist society , but this is a potentially explosive issue . <p> There has been wrangling over Mexican truckers since NAFTA went into effect in 1994 with no political fallout . So , you might be thinking that it is a non-issue . But things are different now . We have 43 million people on food stamps and a massive unemployment problem . And that is a powder keg just waiting for a spark . <p> Of course , Americans workers have barely objected to being replaced by foreigners . As we speak , information-technology ( IT ) workers at Xerox are docilely training their Indian replacements . Perhaps they are content with their severance packages , which must be very generous considering the hit to 4Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react the same way ? Suppose a CEO of a trucking company sauntered into a Teamsters meeting , lighted a cigar with a flaming $100 bill , and announced : <p> " Listen up boys . Your Mexican replacements are waiting outside . You will teach them how to drive your rigs , and then you will be fired . The Mexicans will work for $2 per hour and I will purchase another Learjet while you feed your children with food stamps . " <p> Would the CEO get out of the room alive ? And where might that cigar end up ? <p> Of course , it would n't happen that way . Mexican trucking companies would be allowed to operate in the USA . American companies would lose market share and steadily lay off drivers . But you get the idea . <p> We know from history that truckers are much different from IT workers , call-center operators , and factory workers . Remember the New York Daily News strike back in the 1990s ? There were over 500 incidents of violence , including many bombings of delivery trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3.4 million truckers in the USA . <p> And that 's why this particular part of NAFTA has never been implemented . President Obama could order it into effect right now . But he s afraid , just like presidents Bush and Clinton were . But that does n't  mean that Obama wont go through with the pogrom . It only means that he will make sure that he wo n't take all the blame if things get ugly . So , he will seek to line up political allies , and leave the dirty work to his new chief of staff , Bill Daley . <p> It is Daleys appointment that indicates how determined Obama is on this issue . Daley worked for President Clinton and helped to ram NAFTA through Congress in the first place . <p> Obama is getting pressure from farmers because Mexico has put retaliatory tariffs on US food exports , so this is a farmers vs. truckers battle . However , Obama will have support from the big companies because eradicating the truckers will be seen as the next driver ( ha , ha ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers with foreigners is , after all , our official national business model . <p> And it is n't going to be changed unless the American people insist . Its like the Vietnam War ; it might still be going on today , enriching the military-industrial complex , if Americans had n't  taken to the streets to put an end to it . And it did n't  really take that much resistance . A few burned draft cards , a few hippies shot at Kent State . It was n't really a revolution , but an intensification of our democratic process . <p> So , will the Teamsters strike ? Will they fight ? They certainly have in the past , and they are probably very angry right now . They had been Republican allies , but supported Obamas campaign , and they must feel betrayed now . <p> On the the other hand , American truck drivers are an aging population . Maybe they do n't  have much fight left in them , and can be bought out just like those IT workers at Xerox . <p> The trucking industry says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen empty shelves at your grocery store ? No , you have not . There may be a shortage of truckers willing to work for peanuts , or maybe the trucking companies are just trying to scam some more " training " dollars out of the Department of Transportation , but I 'm pretty sure that we do n't  need Mexicans to drive our trucks . <p> I do n't  now how this will play out . But I do think that we might be approaching the limits of the American peoples tolerance for " free trade " induced poverty , and I think that Obama would be wise not to push that limit .

@@88485435 @3985435/ <h> TRIN Oversold <p> According to my trading program , the TRIN closed Monday at 2.03 . While that is a very oversold level , it is no guarantee that the market will bounce . Looking at recent history , a high TRIN only presaged a bounce while the market was up-trending . So , if the market is beginning another leg down , then it will do so regardless of how oversold it is . <p> However , since this is Month-End Markup Week , I would be surprised to see a plunge . The big funds will do their best to keep their holdings up so that their marketing departments will be able to paint rosy pictures for the month . And with volume being so light , the big funds can easily levitate the market . <p> Of course , if there is a disastrous event , not even the big funds will be able to keep things from falling apart . Such an event would be along the lines of a super-spike in oil , a massive loss of jobs , or a spectacular bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , then this week could look much the same as last week : maybe a little more downside , then the big funds come in and buy , the market stabilizes , and then rallies to end the week . <p> But I would n't hold any long positions over the weekend , because such a scenario would be a recipe for another Monday Massacre . <p> Hurricane Gustav is headed straight for the Gulf of Mexico , but if it does go there it would n't arrive until next week .

Ill watch closely and becareful of a break of 1263 on the SPX as that might be used to sucker in shorts for a push up by end of week . I will definitely be short this market , but only if it drifts upwards by end of the week . <p> I agree with Matt .. being long right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be around your comp during the day . <p> Yesterday , Cramer had the audacity to blame the GSEs and the Treasury ( for not nationalising them ) for the stock markets problem . It took him all of one day to take back his market-bottom call and admit that we will see test the July lows ( without GSE nationalization ) . <p> What do you guys think about GSE nationalization ? I had thought that the market would take this as a negative ( housing is in worse shape than thought + weaker dollar ) . One theory is that the nationalization would reduce the spreads between Treasuries and GSE bonds . As the theory goes , this lower interest rate would then be passed on to home buyers , and the problems in the housing market would be gone . Personally , I still do n't  buy it . <p> 1 ) I think it will take time , not lower interest rates to heal the housing market . Otherwise , the banks could just reduce their current spreads and fix the market themselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a weaker dollar . Would the effect be that much different than if the FED lowered the funds rate ? You can say hello again to higher commodities . <p> 3 ) If FRE and FNM are doing that bad , than the banks loan businesses would be doing even worse since they have riskier loans on the balance sheets . I would n't be surprised if the banks just use most of the larger spread to heal themselves instead of passing it one to home-buyers . <p> I 've changed my opinion on GSE nationalization . IMHO nationalization will cause a rally ( something bears should be cautious off ) , because the short-term investor market setiment ( Cramer ) thinks it will be good . Long term , it just draws out the process , so we may not test the July lows again until next 2009 . Any other opinions ? <p> My feeling is the nationalization of the GSES will most likely cause a rally , as it will be once again be seen by the public that the government is willing to step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the long term consequences . Think Bear Stearns bailout . <p> This is not to say we cant fall back afterwards , but the initial reaction would be a rally . <p> And Matt , not to be conspirital in nature , but I do n't  see any govt employment figures coming out really negative at this time with the market so close to a fallout = <p> Paul , this is the main reason i have hesitated to initiate a short position . i think the nationalization of the GSEs or even another statement by the PPT will lead to a rally . i think it would be very positive for the mkt for a few reasons : 1 ) it gets rid of the uncertainty ; 2 ) it lowers mortgage rates and high mortgage rates have been exacerbating the housing depression ; 3 ) GSE security prices stabilize and investors place more confidence in the price of those securities even if the equity price goes to $0 and the pfd gets wiped out . i have obviously been wrong b/c i thought somethign would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPT does n't  do anything for months , equity markets blast past their lows and once everyone is short , they announce the bailout . <p> Nationalization will be " perceived " to be good as it shows the government is doing something to help . Just like how the stimulus checks were seen as being good or the Bear Sterns bailout and hence there will be a rally , BUT , it will actually have a overall negative impact . People wont see it as being negative until it fully plays out though and by then , it will be old news . <p> We need to be very careful here . <p> BTW .. Paul , did anyone answer your question about a site/tool that can be used to compare volumes for markets yesterday ? Interesting in finding something that show that too . <p> No , I still do n't  have intra-day volume averages . I suppose if anyone knows where to download intraday volume , then the averages could be computed . <p> On another note , it looks like UNG may have bottomed yesterday ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Oil probably is n't far behind . <p> For the bears weary of a GSE takeover , perhaps shorting IWM is the way to go ( Matt has already pointed out the weakness there yesterday ) . Lower interest rates will not benefit small-caps as much as large caps ( cheaper bonds ) and financials . Also , the weaker dollar will hurt them . <p> a ) that the Chinese do n't  have to pay for it ( and they went even public a couple of days ago showing their limited understanding of risk in financial transactions but they have nukes showing their superior understanding of risk-mitigation strategies ) b ) will not cost the US banks billions in write-downs ( JPM going to take a 600 million hit because of GSE stock price decline in Q3 . Regional banks have no nukes but they are closer to home and it is an election year ) c ) Mr Paulson can get his entry in the history books <p> My gut feeling is something like a nationalization of the losses might do the quick and dirty trick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out later . c ) should lead to impressive results . <p> The market will go up , because any action is good action . Wait a couple of months and overoptimistic earning expectations missed and the size of the mess in the financial markets will bring stocks down again . So this is more likely a short termish ( months ) issue . I have no feeling for when the soundness of the dollar will be called in question <p> Any action will ( should ) be timed to prevent a rapid decline in markets , so a market level around the July lows will be an interesting time . Let 's see how the market reacts to fabricated double-bottoms where neither the first nor the second low were caused by market forces but by interventions . ( So much for the quant guys and their time series ) <p> If your trading software is programmable , you might be able to code your own intra-day volume indicator , or hire a programmer to do it for you . Ive been thinking about doing that myself , but I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coding should n't be too hard . You would just take the volume for the day , and the elapsed time for the day , and calculate a projected value . <p> I saw Cramer backing off on his " July bottom gospel " last night .

We were all expecting a bump up today for example and got an almost perfect d-day . Thought the MaTTrindicator was telling us the truth yesterday and did n't  look very strong at close to my feeble mind . Matt ? <p> The TRIN has come off of its overbought condition , but not by very much . The TRINQ is now on an oversold reading , but that has n't  been helping the NAZ . No indicator is perfect , and there are times that they wont work right .

The US Treasury can loan , contribute etc to the FEDs balance sheet . That was main reason for Gold move , , , the FED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have NOT done during this meltdown ) . Also Treasury wants FED to pay banks interest on their reservesthat is something ! <p> After seeing gold spike in the morning ( and after about a month of battering of gold for some reason ) I did buy some DGP ( which is 2x gold ) as a small hedge against the possibility that this would be the turning point . Seeing the rise this evening , I might buy a little more . But , remember that DGP is not physical gold . CEF is a combination of physical gold and silver ( at the historical ratio of 1:50 oz ) . It is a long running fund in Canada . <p> I guess I should have chosen my words more carefully . What I meant was that they were out of Treasuries . <p> As I understand it , when the US wants to spend more money , the Treasury Dept issue Treasuries . The FED controls the money supply by deciding how much Treasuries to sell and how many to keep in reserve . If the FED runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to sell the cr*p collateral that they have received instead ( or recall loans ) . <p> So essentially , when they are out of Treasuries , they are pretty much kaput . They need the US to keep issuing debt . <p> Of course , as I said , this is my understanding of it and I 'm not a professional . <p> That is , the FED would have to recall the treasuries that they loaned to the banks and give the banks back the collateral CDOs , MBSs , etc. that the banks gave to the FED as collateral or the FED would have to sell the collaterla themselves ( not sure if they are allowed to ) . <p> Paul , you are correct . Newly issued bonds are sold by the treasury and this increases our debt since they sell newly created bonds . The Fed does not buy/sell newly issued bonds . They operate on the open market only . When the FED buys/sells bonds it changes the money supply , but not the debt since they are buying/selling bonds that were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crap ton of bonds they have built up over the years . Of course , now they traded them all for crappy mortgage packagesgreeaaat . <p> We can run up such a huge debt because the rest of the world keeps buying our newly created bonds . I suspect after all is said and done in the next few years , that will change . That will be our true time of reckoning . <p> So if the US stopped issueing debt ( never gon na happen , but this is theorethical ) , and the FED traded or sold all of their existing Treasury stock , then they could n't make any more loans , is this correct ? <p> I could be wrong here I am just reporting what I hear . Today was the first time *in history* the Fed had to ask the Treasury for a loan . Again , just what I hear I do n't  have a specific source I can cite . <p> Also some treasury or other ( havent looked it up yet ) actually had its yield go negative at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money market fund that was valued at ninety-seven cents . <p> This normally smells like a panic bottom is close but dang this is some spooky stuff . And I hear the Fed now " lied " about lending to LEH . They actually lent $40 billion and said they did n't  until today when they legally had to report it . <p> Not only that , but the Fed is trying to encourage China to buy US financial firms . <p> Zen , I heard all of the same things , but mostly from CNBC . The Lehman bit I heard on Karls youtube video . I regard all of the above ( with the ecception of the Treasury " loan " or whatever ) as unconfirmed . <p> Paul , as far as I know , yes . I want to say the FED holdings were around 800 billion . Scary thought . <p> Keep in mind my credentials : I am some guy named " towelie " if you do n't  watch South Park , just do a google image search . <p> Well , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying ( or has been forced ) to inflate us out of this . I say bright side , because he has always appeared to indicate that was his planbut up until now the treasury has not been called upon to go into overdrive . That dichotomy always bothered me . <p> " A day after Fed officials seized control of American International Group Inc. , the Treasury yesterday acted at the Feds request to fortify the central banks balance sheet with $100 billion in new cash . Fed officials can use the proceeds to pump money into financial institutions fearful of lending to each other , or to catch the next insolvent bank that 's unable to raise capital " <p> It can be treasuries and or new currency in circulation , when all said and done it is just a book entry from one Govt account to another

However , the QQQQ is still trapped within its channel , so that is an important non-confirmation . Blame Steve Jobs and that new " phoneless phone " of his which dragged Apple down , and the Qs along with it ( though the Qs did manage to close above their 200-day moving average ) . <p> The XLF celebrated the watered-down FinReg bill by running up an impressive bull-flag pattern on its intra-day chart . Can the XLF lead the market higher ? Perhaps , though on Friday it looked like we had rotation out of tech and into financials , which does n't  strike me as terribly bullish . Also , NYSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at +1,430 , and all the bulls had to show for it was a lousy 3 points . That 's not encouraging . <p> However , it is possible that traders will be taken by surprise by Bloombergs survey of economists which showed that the consensus estimate is for +113,000 private-sector jobs in Fridays big jobs report . Everybody " just knows " that the economy has gone off of a cliff , right ? But in reality , companies are hiring at a brisk rate . For example , this Wall Street Journal story reports that Red Hat ( Linux ) of Raleigh , N.C. , is expanding its workforce by 25% from 3,200 to 4,000 geeks . One day , IBM will buy Red Hat and send all of those jobs to India , but until then small tech companies like Red Hat appear to be doing land-office business and are staffing up . <p> As I write this Sunday night , the futures are green and trading sedately , so their body language is bullish . Of course , things can go haywire when Europe opens in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday might look like for SPY . This 5-minute chart of the last two days shows that SPY tried to print in inverse head-and-shoulders reversal pattern : <p> However , Friday afternoons rally was n't strong enough ( red arrow ) to reach up to the level of Tuesdays high ( red " X " ) . So , SPY was not able to print a horizontal neckline , and the pattern should be considered a neutral symmetrical triangle . <p> With a bullish resolution , SPY might be able to rally $1.50 based upon a 100% Fibonacci extension : <p> From the 100% Fibonacci level , I have drawn a blue line to the left , and it lands right on the top of SPYs down-gap from Thursday . So , that seems like a reasonable target . The IWM completely filled its Thursday gap already , and that 's an indication that SPY may be able to follow suit . <p> The green arrow at the right of the chart points to and " End of Range " signal . The last such signal ( purple arrows ) appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SPY broke out of its range rather emphatically . Not a bad signal , huh ? So , SPY is poised to make a big move , though the FDI can go higher before SPY breaks out . Perhaps we wont get the breakout until Fridays jobs report . And do n't  forget that the FDI does not predict the direction of the breakout , only that it is likely coming soon . <p> Other bullish factors are that all of the top ETFs made , and held , 9/36/15 cross-ups on Friday , and the TRIN is in a bullish condition . This chart shows the QQQQ in the bottom panel , and a three-day moving average of the NASDAQ TRIN ( TRINQ ) in the upper panel : <p> If the moving average has indeed peaked ( blue arrows ) and turned down , then it may be signaling that a swing-low has been printed like it did last time on June 8th ( purple arrows ) . <p> But as long as the Qs are trapped in last weeks downtrend channel , nothing good can happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down , then the bottom of SPYs June 10th gap at 106.02 is a likely target . <p> So , the Qs need to break their trend channel before the bulls can run : 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 39 thoughts on " SPY Ready to Rally ?

In previous bailouts , the Dow ran 1,000 points . This time , it just fizzled . So shorts are very confident now and eager for more pops to puncture , which is exactly what they did on Wednesday . The morning gap-up was immediately sold , and an afternoon rally attempt was immediately sold . <p> So the bears are very confident and aggressive now . What about the bulls ? The bulls are filled with dread . They had their hopes raised on Wednesday only to have them dashed . The market had solid gains during the day , but then gave most of it back . <p> Normally , the talking heads on CNBC are oblivious to the intra-day drama . But on Wednesday , Erin Burnett was skeptical of the days rally , saying that it was a 200-up/200-down market , so why get excited by just another routine 200-up day ? The key was that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complacency , and overconfidence all sell-signals . <p> Maria Bartiromo also had her hopes dashed . In the afternoon as the bounce faded , she said that the Dow was " struggling " to hold onto its gains .

Then the Super Bears crushed their rally . <p> Now the Super Bears are ready to crush more rally attempts . But the market will likely thwart them by not giving them any . The market rarely replays the same theme two days in a row . So , with a neutral news-flow , I would expect the bulls to lay down and die , and the market to roll over leaving a lot of bears frustrated that they are n't  shorter . <p> I cant predict the news flow for tomorrow , but as we are in a global recession , the news-flow odds do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asian markets , we should open down on a gap and probably spend the day plunging . <p> We also seem to have a Long-Term-Capital style liquidity seize-up in the corporate bond market .

" What were going to need to see is at least one quarter where the financial institutions do n't  show write-downs and do show profits and an ability to grow their business .

While I do n't  see prices dropping too far ( except housing ) , with oil and other commodities dropping , inflation seems to have moderated . <p> My view on trading is to look at fundamentals for the long term trend , and then wait for technicals ( price levels , volume , support/resistance , market attitude ) to catch up . <p> SPY chart . many technicals say today was a suckers rally and a huge down day tomorrow . but with the communist government we now have interferring with the free markets ( or what 's left of it ) , who knows . <p> When Rich mentions " EW " he is referring to Elliot Wave Theory .

The short answer is : were headed down . <p> Also , I would recommend looking at options trading since you appear to be fairly adept at reading intra-day charts . I usually go with two-three day trades with options . Day trading them could get dicey if you have a bad day . Be prepared for wild swings , it takes some getting used to be okay with a 10% loss hours after you make a trade only to have it turn into a 20% gain the next day . <p> Options have some strange " dark cloud " around them as if they are so complicated only the egg-heads on wall street can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT complicated and they are an essential tool for any trader . I tried to convince my friend who purchased a big lot of FRE ( yes , I tried to warn him several times ) a while ago to buy a few put options as insurance but he did n't  seem to willing to understand how it worked . Given the current stock price he might have come out even or ahead had he done it . <p> The fact that you can pre-define your gain/loss ahead of time can really add to peace of mind . I would recommend a quick beginners options book to get the gist of each type of trade and then start doing a few small trades to see if you 're comfortable . <p> PS anyone know a decent broker who specializes in options trading or a good general broker who has good options trading tools ?

If the IWM itself is at an inflection point , it implies that the IWM will trend and thus you can infer the components will too , but , supposing fewer components had FDIs of near 1 , than the IWM suggests , it could mean a choppier or weaker move . <p> Essentially , possibly the IWM can show FDI of 1 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8% are at 1 , but 64% are bw 1.3 -1.5 , meaning most of the IWM itself is still semi-directionless , so you would have that addl insight into your IWM reading . <p> You could also advance it further by measuring the basket of FDI stocks by any of the numerous measures of trend to get another sense ( over whatever time frame you picked ) if the FDI is portending a break higher or lower . <p> It would be very interesting to know what insights could be gleaned from this . <p> That 's an interesting idea . One thing I have noticed though is that the FDI behaves differently with smaller stocks . I think that might be because small-caps can deliver more potent man-made surprises , like FDA drug approvals . Fractal behavior is a natural phenomena , which seems to work well in the markets when there is mass participation by humans . <p> Overnight went up to resistance and back down to yesterdays close .

I still would be curious to see if that collective market FDI info would be relevant . <p> The whole idea of FDI is really compelling to me because if I understand the math correctly , the more the preceding move predicts the next move ( ie how linear the move has been ) the closer to 1 you get . I only want to trade stocks that are linear such that they go straight where ever they are going , ideally . <p> If the last moves have been so random as to be a 2 , then I like the idea of betting on some linear move , with the right setup/risk etc. seems attractive , especially when the stock is already strong per other metrics ( like basing quietly after an up move ) . <p> Two perfect examples of good and bad are GGAL last summer , and BPOP , well , since the last two years . <p> BPOP is like a buzzsaw to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer was EZ money .

What if the constituents are doing something else , per FDI ? <p> The last thought I have is that the main flaw of many breadth counters is they do not weight anything properly . <p> In a typical advance decline line , or new high/new low type of indicator , they will add a tally when , say , AAPL makes a new high and subtract one when WRCX makes a new low , or +1 for up -1 for down . <p> There is NO WAY those two cancel each other out with respect to market sentiment , money flows , etc , but for the purposes of the new high new low breadth indicators etc they are the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iBC after many , many internal disagreements over everything from content , to layout , to the whole purpose of the site .

And he drew the exact wrong conclusion . February is in the books now and receipts were actually up 3.8% . See for yourself . First , look at the final total from February 2010 ( click image to enlarge ) : <p> Inside the red box , you see $139,589 , right ? Now , let 's look at the final report for February 2011 that was released today : <p> Inside the red box , you see $144,891 . And that is $5,302 higher than $139,589 . And since the numbers are expressed in millions , that 's a $5.3 billion beat . <p> That is flat-out year-over-year growth of 3.8% . <p> Colas did n't  even get the sign of the number right ! Ridiculous ! <p> And there was a huge tax-cut too , right ? The only rational , objective way to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a very healthy clip . If you like , you can change " creating " into " re-instating jobs lost during the Great Recession " , but the idea that the economy is contracting , stalling , or even slowing down just does n't  fly . As a matter of fact , things are likely accelerating , though we cant tell for sure because the tax-cut has clouded this data . <p> So why did Colas get it so horribly wrong ? He made a couple of rookie mistakes . First of all , he used a period that was too brief . Paychecks go out every other Friday , monthly , or twice-monthly . When comparing two periods of withholding data , you absolutely must use periods that contain equivalent pay-cycles . <p> Colass second rookie mistake was to synchronize to the calendar rather than the work week . February 2010 began on a Monday , while February 2011 began on a Tuesday . That will often make a big difference . <p> So , Colas did n't  use enough data , and the periods he compared were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for non-comparable data . Here is what Colas did : <p> Here is the correct way to handle this sensitive data : <p> Notice how I grouped the data into work-weeks ( #5 through #8 of the year ) .

Calendar February was up 3.8% , but that should be taken with a grain of salt because the calendar was a bit out of sync . <p> In any case , the fact that the data is higher after a large tax-cut is pretty miraculous . <p> As to the markets , they may well continue to react to events in the Middle East rather than to our expanding economy . 209106 @qwx829106 <h> 31 thoughts on " Nicholas Colas Bungles Withholding-Tax Analysis " <p> Nice analysis Matt .

Thanks . <p> The 1.71% is an empirical read of the raw data as reported .

Yes , we 've seen that happen before , but the overall " look " ( gestalt trading ) looks better to me as finishing off today with an X wave to fake out longs and shorts . Having possible minuette 1 of 3 down then allows for minuette 3 of 3 down , etc. , which allows the wave to extend further than if we just hit a 5 low after a 4 triangle .

Bon weekend . <p> Here is why it must be a typo : In 2009 , the IRS processed about 168 million personal tax returns . If all of those people got the $400 MWP credit , the total would have been $67.2 billion . And since their withholding taxes were reduced over the course of the year , the amount should have been about $5.6 billion per month . <p> Heres part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal income report . Its a separate line . And it does overwhelm the MWP number down $94.9 bln vs up $55 bln for MWP ( both are seasonally adjusted and annualized ) . That 's on Table 3 . <p> BEA says the better way to judge possible changes in employment picture is to look at disposable personal income and ex-out both the SS and MWP provisions . In that case , disposable income in Dec rose $48.5 bln or 0.4 pct , and $11.4 bln in Jan , or 0.1 pct . But from as best I can judge , the gain is n't coming from higher wages .

You could have done very well shorting the Qs 3.7% . Or you could have bought some QID and done twice that 7.3% . But if you had bought a put option on the QQQQ such as QAVND you could have done 20 times better . <p> Here is a " percentage " chart .

Notice that the put option ( purple line ) soared so high that it makes the Qs and QID look flat ( click to enlarge ) : <p> This is why people with inside information always buy options . <p> The put mentioned above is a " front month " " at the money " option . Those are the most volatile . You should not trade them until your short-term timing is excellent unless you enjoy having your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts on " Options Fun " <p> but seriously , what you said is why I opened a TOS acct . Same idea with e-mini . One thing that messes up my TA is volatility premium , which is why I usually focus on equities and also why I like futures no premium . You have excellent timing , I would like to say I do as well , and yeah , its great to have the leveraged winds fill your sails when you 're right . If you are positioned for the big move , days like today can make your week/month/year . <p> I made a SPY put daytrade a few weeks back that returned something ludicrous like 19% when the index itself moved like 2% . <p> I do n't  even know what volatility premium is . I know almost nothing about options , but am apparently one of the few people who makes money trading them . If I think the market will go up , I buy calls . If I think it will go down , I buy puts . I also make charts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a lot of complexity to options and lots of sophisticated strategies , but if you have good short-term timing , you do n't  need to know any of it . <p> Yes , I like futures too . I would have put the NQ on the chart , but I 'm not sure how to compare futes to options and stocks since there really is n't a percentage gain as you get paid per point . <p> Hahaonce I made the mistake of buying at the money put options at the close that expired in two days ( I wanted them a month or two out ) . I was up 19% by the time I could refresh my screen literally a few seconds I tried to sell them right then and there but botched the order because I could n't click fast enough so I got to wait until the next morning to sell.We gapped up slightly the next morning and I was instantly down 35% .

Roughly even on the year , but that 's counting two bonehead trades that I initiated in late December and dumped on the 1st . I 'm going for the quality over quantity thing right nowIll let you all know how it works in the coming months . <p> So anyone know of another charting software other than TradeStation that can plot options prices intraday ? Hell , even daily would be niceI kinda have to go by memory since I know of no other ways . <p> To give you all an idea of the power of options : You can only lose what you buy ( unlike shorting ) You can make money when the market goes up , down , or even sideways Some of the more complex options trades can make money when the market stays in a tight trading range ( you make money on the decrease in volatility and time decay ) . Others do the opposite you make money when there is a large break-out up OR down ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hedge for longer term stock purchases to limit losses ( and profits too , of course ) . For instance , you could go long 100 shares of stock and then buy one out of the money put option and you have now capped your losses and gains . You are guaranteed not to lose any more than amount X and it can all be calculated before you make the trade . I tried to recommend this to my idiot friend who purchased FNM while they were around $5.00 and he asked why on Earth he would want to limit his profitsApparently the whole limiting losses thing was n't much of a concern to him . Oh well . <p> Keep in mind that you need to be able to take the huge increase in volatility and need to learn to scale back the amount of money you trade .

I like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case we get really toppy or have yet another bailout announcement . Still got ta work on that timing thing . <p> junglegirl : I found " The Options Course " by Fontanills to be a decent starter book for options . It starts out frustratingly basic but builds on it all to show most strategies out there . Honestly , once you figure it out , there are only a few basic trades and the more complex strategies just combine them in fairly clever ways . <p> I have never read an options book , so towelie is far more knowledgeable than I am on the subject . <p> What I do is just analyze a chart , say the IWM , figure out which side I want to be on , and then , instead of trading the IWM or related ETF , I buy options instead . And of course , I fade the crowd . When everybody is going berserk buying calls like they were up until today , I start buying puts . Fading a bullish call-buying spree in a bear market is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you need to be able to take the huge increase in volatility and need to learn to scale back the amount of money you trade . " Very funny in retrospect . = <p> IB offer options charts , one nice feature is you can select bid/ask instead of trades . Since they can be pretty thinly traded you do n't  see much just looking at trades . However , the bid/ask view shows you were you what people were thinking so you can place your limit orders . I have made decent profits trading the PUTs until I got in over my head = <p> I agree with Matt that for short term trades , with at the money options , only the direction of the price movement matters . You can forget about all that greek stuff . PUN inteneded .

The SPX 805 area may get sliced through and act as stiff resistance . Last month Matt said you can kiss the 9 handle goodbye . The same may be true of the 8 handle soon . The DOW may have already left the building located at 8000 South Reality road . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what is even more fun is being the one that sells them . <p> Imagine this .. if you think that say any equity is going to go up , you can buy it and sell covered calls on it . I did that with SRS recently . <p> Bought SRS @ $66 , but sold at the money covered calls for $10 , thus lowering my cost to $56 if they expire worthless . If SRS is " in the money " @ month end , then I sell @ $66 and earn $1000 per contract . <p> What happened ? SRS tanked to low $50s . I then covered my option @ $2 . This brought my cost back up to $58 . Then I sold $60 Feb Calls for $5 a piece . This then lowered my cost of SRS to $53 per share . So at the end , if SRS closes above $60 , then I sell and gain $700 , but if it is below $60 @ options X , then I keep the shares . I can keep doing this repeatedly given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options get called though , I always ensure I make some money at the end given the settlement strike and the options premium . <p> I pulled a similar trick with FAZ shares recently . It is a nice way to generate revenue on shares .. the only downfall is that I may lose my shares , but if I do n't  , I can hold them and continue to generate revenue each month off them . <p> Another downfall is of course that if the underlying equity takes off .. then I limit my profit .. but that is ok in my mind given the security of the hedge . I 'm just learning this btw .. <p> I 'm going to try and sell some naked puts near options X .. see if I can get some $$ from that . I also hear that there are straddle or butterfly options plays that can pay 10 1 if executed properly . Those require you to predict the closing price of a equity where both calls and puts expire worthless . This is done by simultaneously selling calls and put options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you predicted the strike . <p> In the past , I would make my option size a tenth to a fifth of the ETF size . But as my timing improves , I will likely make the option size bigger . I may stop trading the ETFs altogether unless they come out with quadruple ETFs to keep me interested . <p> Thanks Matt . I always have a hard time sizing my option trades since there is the potential to lose a majority of the equity in the trade . I am working on buying bigger positions . My option trades are usually 1/50th the size of my etf trades ( unlevered ) . <p> Matt , I want to start trading options more often , but need to get more comfortable with them . You 're definitely one of the best traders in the blogosphere so I wanted to know how you handle option trades that go against you in the very near term ? do you hedge the option trade by going the other way with a leveraged ETF ? On Friday I was long some Feb 30 IYR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I though about hedging with a long ETF trade but could n't bring myself to buy into the rally so I just dumped my puts and only broke even .

@@88485534 @3985534/ <h> New App : Random Stock Grapher <p> I just released a new app called Random Stock Grapher . Its a simple , free app that uses a random number generator to make charts that resemble stock charts . So , if you are trying to decide whether or not stock-price movement is random , you might want to play with this app . <p> There are RSG versions for Windows , Mac , and Raspberry Pi . I would make an iOS version if I had a lot of time on my hands to jump through all of Apples flaming hoops to get it in the App Store . One does not simply distribute an iOS app after all .

Perhaps someone could refine this for quicker entries on higher frames . <p> You Da Man ! ! ! ! Dats what I 'm talkin bout . That chart share site will WORK . You have to promise when I ask questions in the future you will not think I am challenging your methods . I will only be asking to understand your thought process . I have been working with some backtesting that only uses the 36MA on the 15 minute chart . If you have the tracking window displayed and use your crosshairs , slide across and look at the values displayed for the 36MA . That is what Julie got me to thinking about . We chase all these indicators that are actually just derivatives of price . The 36MA is the PRICE recent history . It has its own qualities as far as increase , decrease , difference from one bar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horizontal . It can be decreasing or increasing quickly or slowly . I guess what I am saying is it cuts out ALL the noise of the indicators and let 's one focus on price . It is a buy low and sell higher game is n't it ? Use your crosshairs and help me think this through . Your charts are a great benefit thanks for the effort you put in to share . I HAVE to go watch the Yankees monday . Free tix behind home plate . <p> I am planing a trip to the Carolinas this fall . If you are up for a visit let me know . You are not a beer fan , but surely we could share a steak dinner . <p> here 's a BBT trade I did Friday toward EOD . It made a nice spike down on the 1min . My broker site was slow , and sometimes is during very active trading , and I missed out on .10c . The signal actually came earlier than what I have here , but these free charts are not as dynamic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relationship of price range is narrow . I would take some time to adjust to these if they were being used for trading . <p> I also show what I mean by " pre-buy " . It is merely a " heads up " and does n't  always play out . <p> Those free charts a somewhat different as I state above but at least its something . When I go back to SD and see the same setups , it is much clearer . Beggers ca n't be choosy , right ? <p> I understand that you questions are to buzzard my brain . No problem . Always glad to show what I 'm doing . Now that I have a means of showing what I do it will be somewhat clearer . <p> Correct about price that 's all that really matters . Well , except for the direction . And , its about catching a price move on that devil of the leading edge of the chart that gives us an advantage that maybe this move is going our way . Throw in trade management and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I come up with . Had a couple on Friday . <p> I do n't  try to analyze this to death like I did in the past ( analysis paralysis ) . I now understand that consistancy and following a plan are the key . Its a known fact that even the most simple trading plan is profitable as long as it is followed . <p> A long time ago , I had a trading book where the author was making a trade . I do n't  recall the time frame but he took every trade that came along in order to get the " big one " . Well , poppycock . That 's not needed with using proper setups which will indicate a high probability of a " big one " . This is when I discovered using multiple time frames . That served me well . Now Ive ended up taking many trades anyway ! = <p> Yanks are tuff , and the Rangers pitching is suspect . Maybe we can out score them though . <p> Open a new chart for some stock on the 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at the 36 MA and play with it . Looking at it , where would you buy and where would you sell . Where would you buy betting there is .25 profit ahead . Think about the value of the 36MA . <p> Your comment the other day was a pearl . Does n't  matter whether you enter on the price cross of the 36 or the 9MA cross of the 36 , as long as you are consistent . Not greedy and consistent are primary goals . <p> I did that with BBT . I would buy when the first green candle opened and closed above 36MA , get .25 and exit or have a stoploss when a red candle breaks below the 36MA . <p> Then , and this is n't fair because C is only a 3-handle , I looked at it and it was fairly consistent in a gap up then fall back down with a higher low . Then I added a 9MA and that made all the difference in success . Check that one out . <p> In the C example , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it filters out whipsaws the past two days as well as confirms entries on the 15min chart . Note that the 15min would still be used to exit . Plus , using a filter like this would allow the trade to remain even at the close or a variation like taking half off at the close . <p> THIS is what we need programmed . <p> Those are the kind of trades that are ideal for the numeric odds plays . And it does n't  matter what values the MAs are as long as they are spaced reasonably apart not too close and not too far . <p> BTW , except for SRS and a couple of others , the past two trading days have been nothing but whipsaws for these trading methods . <p> If you take that concept to a quicker indicator , it may have even better results . <p> For example , using a MACD in any time frame . Get in on the cross , get some of the ATR and get out . If you can program that , its a winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the position of the MACD trendlines . If below the zero line , a short scalp , if above the trendline , a longer scalp . <p> Okay , here 's an example of watching 5min ( which is normal ) and managing the trade three ways : <p> First , exiting only if price crosses 9MA and MACD is 1 tick down or MACD trendlines cross ; <p> Second , if price makes it above 36MA , that means 5min stochastic moving up and also possibly MACD , so only exit if 9MA crosses down below 36MA . <p> Thirdly , use 5min to manage the trade . I would normally do this if there is some kind of movement on the 15min indicators . Like , if it gives a buy and continues on . <p> Note the possible entry points during this trade . Also , I would get the .20c , then get back in the trade if Im frisky . If Im lazy , I 'll just stay in until 5min stochastic or something takes me out . Or ride higher if the 15min or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three indicators turn almost simultaneously , that is a stronger move/buy . Often , as in the BBT trade , the stochastic or MACD will make a move too soon , and while it could still be profitable , it is sort of a broken move and not as reliable nor is it as easy to manage the trade . <p> And on a lighter note , the county is going to raise property taxes 2.7% due to reduced revenues . This extra $35 million dollars will allow each department to continue to say " make sure you spend everything in your budget or you wo n't get the same amount next year " . <p> George sounds great but I feel like dropping out of the loop here . I do n't  have any problems with Silverlight on other sites but this is odd <p> Opening one of the links takes ages , uses 1.5GB and takes one kernel to 100% load . Then I end up seeing only the " background " , eg headings , borders and stuff but no price data , no curves , no lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at MS but not to much avail . So I shot freestockcharts support an e-mail , maybe they have some ideas . I 'm using ie8 ( which is a huge improvement to ie7 ) and a high-speed line so I think at should at least be able to see your static images . <p> Ive been trying to get mine to not work . I found that if I go to Tools , Internet Options , Security tab , Custom Level , Run ActiveX and control plug-ins , I can select " Disable " and it wont work because it is a plug-in or add-on . I also went to Tools , Add-ons to insure it was active . <p> ( Silverlight is listed as an ActiveX " type " although my understanding is that it is not . ) <p> However , youd probably know if this was checked because a lot of sites would hound you to install their activeX . <p> My performance problem with Silverlight was my security program AVG . It had a resident shield that was checking everything on a website . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silverlight pages load almost instantaneously . <p> Downloaded the latest release of Silverlight and Opera . Opera works with Silverlight and it does fine with freestockcharts . Not quite as fast as IE but not real slow either . <p> AVG could have been the resource problem , too . I believe the resident shield function was constantly checking content as it was streamed and the screen updated . My desktop machine is 3.5GHZ and should have no performance issues . <p> I use IE6 still . Normally , Opera is faster than IE and has some functions I like better than IE7s tabs . I may try IE8 to see if it has improved . Its supposed to be faster than many others but I saw where the favorites function is klugy . It was changed so every current address is listed along with the folders which requires scanning down to the folder of choice to save the bookmark . <p> Yerk , I hope you get yours working . I have two browsers working correctly with Silverlight so there are some options . I may install Firefox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code to backtest the BBT trade from Friday . Good chance I got it wrong , but it is something to play with for a start . The entry was an effort to capture when the 1 minute bar , 1 bar ago opened and closed above the 9MA , along with the 5 minute bar being pushed above the MACD zero line . It also checks for the 1 minute MACD being above the 0 line . <p> The EXIT is profit over .13 OR the 1 minute bar crossing below the 9MA . <p> To run just click on the backtest ICON on the left toolbar towards the top . That will bring up a Backtesting spreadsheet . Then on the top toolbar there will be a backtest menu . Click on it and strategy setup . Then put in the BBT symbol , limit the test to 5/22 , click test every 1 minute and test up to now . Interval should be set to 1 and no override . Give the startegy a name , Entry formula can be ENTRY . Hit the formula wizard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXIT and repeat . <p> The EXIT is .13 cent profit or the 1 minute bar cross below the 9MA on the 1 . See if you can get it to run . It does capture the EOD trade as a profit , but ones earlier in the day are not . Like I said , I probably did not capture your method accurately , but it should let us discuss why . <p> no silver lining on silverlight for me yet . From my experience ie8 is far better than ie7 or 6 . It finally has the zoom function like opera and each browser window is running as a separate process ( like Chrome ) which can crash without killing the others . And it restores the last configuration once shut down or crashed ( happens from time to time but not that bad ) . Not sure about your comment regards favorites . To me not much difference to the older versions , you 've got folders to organize things . I 'd give it a try ( but you need some time to get rid of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirting with the potential neckline of their potential double top . The neckline is about 875.25 . Another important level is the April 29th breakout above the February peaks , which is 871-872 . <p> That code ran good . I scanned the results . I 'll analyze it tomorrow and see what it needs . I noticed that it did not always fire a trade off ex. 14.30 Fri 22nd and several before that . That is a program problem for not catching those . Then I will study the trade management where as long as the MACD is positive and price is below the 36ma moving up , then stay in the trade . <p> One other thing I believe I have not mentioned . If a time frame MACD trendlines is above the zero line , I only use stochastic cross over . The reason is that problem I was telling you about that the histogram is n't printed correctly it should print above the zero line when the trendlines are above the zero line . Anyway , take a look at that and see if you agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just go with the sto . <p> I 'll give you more feedback tomorrow . Maybe give you another chart example . <p> Now that I think about it , the first Korean bomb was in 2006 when the economy was actually expanding . So , its not that big of a surprise that the market shrugged it off . But now , with the economy still contracting , even if it is " less bad " , this second bomb might cause a bit more fear amongst the bulls . <p> Geroges method and /es quite often the futures top or bottom in the half hour before the market opens and give a buy or sell signal . This move ususally carries on into at least the first minutes of the session , if it is trend day of course longer . <p> Ill be at the ballgame today , but will look for you comments tomorrow . I knew I probably did n't  have it right , but I wanted to get you something so we would have a starting point . If it ran and you have results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referenced there either , so I know I can added that . SD is pretty straight forward . You can look at the code and see what it is looking at . The parameters are patterned too . like for MovingAverageMA , Close , 9,0,1 is the 9 period MA , 0 offset , 1 minute chart . One more comma and number 9,0,1,1 same thing one bar ago . SD does have some quirks , and unfortunately you can build backtest that runs great , but can not be duplicated in real time . Which is VERY aggravating . <p> The method Ive been describing is flexible to some degree and Ks chart shows that very well . That 's why I wanted to put this down in pseudo code in order to cover all the conditions for entry and exit . However , I 'm not sure that could be programmed in SD because of the complexity . For example , two of the three conditions can exist , within a hierarchy , that can trigger a trade . <p> This slight complexity is especially true for trade management . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACD trendlines go above the zero line ? That means that time frame is trending upward and now a new or different set of trade management rules come into play . I either switch to a higher time frame or use the 9/36MA cross to manage the trade and in most cases exit using a lower time frame and some times use the higher time frame . <p> Boiling this down to something for simple logic is harder to accomplish . However , I had a dream about this last night that was a kind of a epiphany . I will use Stringms code for SD to see if I can get it to work . <p> This method is actually straightforward . Describing it and programming it is not . <p> I believe the Friday BBT trade at 14:30 did not fire because while the 1 minute crossed the 9MA , the 5 minute MACD was not being pushed above 0 . The total capture of your strategy in SD would be a pipe dream . I was just hoping that along with my understanding we could end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooting for the home team the Silver Boot champions of the the weekend Go Rangers ! ! ! ! ! ! What are the odds ? <p> The futures were nuclear-bomb proof and closed near their overnight session high , finishing with a classic bull-flag pattern which began forming at 9:35am . <p> However , the SPX futures closed up 0.59% while the NDX futures were only up 0.20% . Its fairly unusual for there to be that much of a difference overnight . So the lagging NDX is a bit of a red flag . Trading resumes at 6pm . <p> wow I cant believe how desperate big item stores are getting . went to look for a mattress and this has got to be one of the most desperate salesmen ever . he even asked if it would be ok if we came in on a weekend so he could get the comission and give us more discount than before . anyways wow how things have changed . 2 years ago when I was there they did n't  have desperate people on the floor . <p> That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a profit , but the original condition exists so it fires again . That is no biggie because if you are just using it for an alert you can control it . It messes up the backtesting results though . I think I am going to concentrate on trading and not testing today . 
@@88485536 @3985536/ <h> Will SPY Hold Its March Low ? <p> Since there was so much war waged over the March low , both falling through it , and then bursting back above it , it is very likely that the market will fall back to test Tuesdays breakout at some point during the next few days .

News of horrific , and worsening economic fundamentals caused the market to plunge Monday night and Tuesday morning . Then plunging oil caused stocks to soar in the afternoon . <p> We will be getting lots more horrific economic news , and oil is likely to keep falling . So , the market will likely remain wild until oil is properly deflated . Then stocks can get back to their bear market . <p> In any case , we are going to need to stay very , very flexible . I will be staying mostly in cash overnight , though I may make large day-trades if I see a major sea-shift happening like we had Tuesday afternoon . <p> Mortgage rates are at an annual high now .

But with the tax-rebate checks ending , the fundamentals for retailers are just as bad as for homebuilders and financials . The XRT also has a broadening pattern on its daily chart . <p> Holding support on a pullback still implies the bullish outcome of the 1310s-30s ( 50 DMA and 50 DEMA ) , the area at which the market is likely to complete the bear market rally and resume a decline to the mid- to upper 1100s and later the 900s-1000s by year end . <p> By late this year or early next , I expect an increase in the number of bank failures , worsening global recession , 6% U rate , commodities prices falling , price inflation decelerating , and the Fed CUTTING RATES and pumping the money supply . <p> We could see a flight to quality/safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield curve and increase margins for financials . <p> The covering shorts and futures piggy-backers just might push the SPX to the 1300s 50 DEMA this morning in a C-wave blow-off , which is not at all uncommon in a bear market rally . <p> Now that the Fed , Treasury , and SEC have succeeded in crushing the shorts in an attempt to recapitalize insolvent banks , what do they do as an encore ? Who will be the buyers under the market next time ? <p> The BKX is now extremely overbought and at or near critical bear market resistance , which could imply that the Treasury- and SEC-induced , artificial , short-covering rally for financials is nearing completion ; however , there is a possible technical structure suggesting a further rally for BKX all the way back to the 200 DMA in the low 80s . <p> BTW , Matt , the rallying US$ does not " boost " stock prices ; rather , IF there is a connection , it is the other way around .

If the S&amp;P 500 is only going to rally 5 points when oil falls $4 , then I am happy to be short here . My short-term model still has a very oversold reading for the S&amp;P 500 , so the market will be looking for an excuse to sell-off .

Just about every company reporting earnings has said that they are laying workers off , so there 's a good chance there will be more claims .

The government has spent so much money in stimulus , it is hard to really feel that the economy is expanding . If it is expanding it is doing so at the expense of more debt . With cash for clunkers , tax credit for home purchases , extended unemployment benefits , census spending , people living in houses they are not paying on , food stamps expenses that are triple , what is the REAL economy anyway . Interesting times we live in . I really do n't  see how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the debt . But Hey ! , what do I know !

We cant just return to S&amp;P500 = 1500 without some foundation . Liquidity induced runups that are financed with new debt does not seem like a good foundation to me . If we do manage to not have a big correction , then rapid inflation seems the only answer . I would like to see a correction , but my fear , and I guess Bernankes , is that it will be like a down goes Joe Frazier moment . No gentle trend downward , but a hard fall . Things are not swell , and hard decisions await all . I have no idea what will happen , near term I think we trend down .

Sadly , inflation is coming and quality of life is going to go down badly . <p> From the business owner standpoint , while I am busier than I was one year ago , I am not nearly as busy as I was in the early 2000s .

When I first heard that John McCain was suspending his campaign because of the financial crisis , I thought : " Wow , this thing is getting out of control if the presidential campaign has to be shut down . " But I had it backwards . <p> As soon as Congress heard that McCain was coming to town , they immediately freaked out . I did n't  realize this until Barney Frank spoke after President Bushs speech Wednesday night . Frank was apoplectic that John McCain was on his way to steal his " Savior of the Economy and Bringer of Justice to Evildoing Bankers " mantle . <p> The presidential campaign is the big show of course , and the cameras will turn toward McCain if he inserts himself into the process .

So Frank went out of his way to assure us that Congress practically had the bill all done and did n't  need McCains help . <p> When Frank first came on TV , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , they jumped up to 1199 . The market does n't  know what 's in the bill , but I think it is just happy that Congress is not going to legislate a meltdown . <p> Can the Market Rally ? Here the factors in favor of a rally Thursday : <p> The market stabilized on Wednesday <p> The Congressional crisis seems to be over <p> The market is oversold <p> Its quarter-end mark-up <p> The big funds probably got a lot of redemptions during the plunge last week , so maybe they wo n't have enough cash to bid the market up this time . But I 'm thinking that it was probably them bidding under the market on Wednesday , and that would explain why stocks were flat while Congress sent credit markets into a panic . <p> Also , we have three important economic reports in the morning . Not that anybody is still paying attention to the economy , but the reports are n't  likely to be rays of sunshine . And of course , bailouts have lost their power to spark rallies . <p> Gun to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I would n't over-stay my welcome . <p> reading books the past few days has really helped i think . well see next week after the shorts return . might get some SKF before october 2 though . once the vampires are back SKF should go up even with the bailout. am i wrong ? <p> First , they complain that people are shorting their stocks ( I 'm sure they were shorting each others stocks ) , so SEC finally puts a ban on that . <p> Next , Morgan Stanley and others are trying to sell hedge funds on the synthetic short position ( buying 1 put and selling 1 call is equivalent to shorting the stock ) . Of course , the brokers get much higher fees , and larger bid-ask spreads with options . So besides protecting their stocks , this actually helps option market makers ( brokers ) . However , if you sell a put , you have to either hedge it by shorting the ( financial ) stock or you hve to hold cash to make the purcahse if assigned ( banks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks offering this sythentic short have two options : <p> 2 ) increase their leverage/exposure to a drop in the stock value of finacials . This approach would be used by banks who do n't  feel that wider credit spreads , lack of confidence , lack of ability to raise capital , etc. , are n't  big enough problems when financial stocks crash . <p> Good point . I wonder how the market would have been the past couple of days with shorts ? Ill definately be watching SKF like I have the past few days . I 'm not sure what overall direction it or the financials will take but it should make some great intraday swings that are reliable . <p> The key is the Congressional plan . If the plan contains significant equity stakes for badly priced asset purchases , then the financials will be more careful about what price they sell to assets to the government . This is the liquidity solution that Paulson and Bernanke say is needed . This is neutral for te financials , neutral for the taxpayers , and a big plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties ( such as equity stakes ) for overpriced assets , then the taxpayers will get stuck with a huge bill at the expense of the financials . This is bullish for the financials . They get to play the reverse auction game ( should be called perverse auction ) where they have to figure out who has the most worthless ( hence lowest ask price ) assets to sell . This is very bullish for financials in the short run . <p> Also , do n't  forget that the SEC can always extend or reinstate the ban . Nobody thought that they would do it , but now that they have , it will be a smaller step to do it again . Londons ban extends until January . <p> The Wall Street Journal reports Congressional leaders have shown amazing restraint in reaching a deal to allocate only one-quarter of a trillion dollars as the first installment on a plan to rescue the world from an impending financial system meltdown . <p> Thanks , George . A head for numbers goes a long way , but I 've never gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In terms of a deal for assets with no equity penalty for overpayment , the gears are already in motion to screw the taxpayer . Credit markets are tighter , treasuries are paying nearly nothing in interest , yet Asset Backed Securities are rising in price : <p> I was really scared there for a second : I found myself agreeing with Cramer . He said Wachovia and BoA would do the best of the big banks becuase they wrote down the most losses already . Since BoA bought Merrill ( who I was slighlty bullish on after their Lone Star asset sale ) and Wachovia is undervalued relative to its peers , I 'd agree . Of course , then we start to diverge <p> His next pick was Goldman Sachs . Also , he said that all the banks would benefit because they could sell the assets for more than they wrote them off . Then he said the government would earn money on these assets ( the ones the banks wrote down losses on ? ) . He also wants to buy loans in California and Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all , there is no way that the banks wrote down their losses close to the market prices ( in fact Goldman has written down very little , even though two of its peers have gone bankupt on similar investements ) . This is the crux of the matter : if the big banks write down the value of their Level 3 assets to Mark-to-Market value , then they would be technically insolvent . This is pretty much a fact . The real question has to do with whether M2M prices are too low . If the answer is " yes , the prices are too low , " then we have an illiquidity problem ( this is what Paulson , Bernanke , and the banks claim ) . If the answer is " no , the market has the prices right , " then we have an insolvency problem . A BIG insolvency problem . <p> So basically if the market of professionals has set one price for these securities , should n't the US Taxpayer get some kind of insurance ( stock warrants ) in case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the link . I think relying on mortgage insurance ( Cantors plan ) is a terrible idea . Basically , he wants Treasury to insure all the mortgages that are n't  insured , and " the owners of these assets should pay for it . " I do n't  have the details , but here is what I found : <p> Problems : 1 ) How would you determine premium rates ? Every mortgage would have to assessed separately . <p> 2 ) Canto rdoesnt understand the complex financing . Mortgages get split into mortgage bonds ( securitized ) , but then these bonds are further recombined and split again into CDOs . The CDOs have different interest rates and different equity stakes . So who exactly pays the premiums ? The mortgage originator ? The servicer ? The owners of the CDOs ( if so , how is this split among the tranches ? ? <p> 3 ) What happens if the premiums do n't  cover the claims ? The taxpayers are on the hook anyway ? <p> 4 ) This plan is too slow acting ( because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . <p> I think it is very safe to say that this plan will be rejected by Paulson and Bernanke with a resounding thud . <p> I 've heard rumors that McCain backed the new plan and that this was an attempt for him to come in and save the day . He has n't  endorsed the plan framework put together by his Republican president and his Senate coleagues on BOTH sides of the aisle . <p> I think the market would have been okay if stuff had progressed FORWARD , even if it took all weekend to finish . With this step back , McCains bold move has put his campaign at major risk and the Democrats have been quick to pounce on this opportunity . If we have a crash tomorrow , the House Republicans and McCain will pay for it politically . <p> Take a look a C-SPAN2 .

Of course , the brokers get much higher fees , and larger bid-ask spreads with options . So besides protecting their stocks , this actually helps option market makers ( brokers ) .

I 'm not sure what overall direction it or the financials will take but it should make some great intraday swings that are reliable . <p> The key is the Congressional plan . If the plan contains significant equity stakes for badly priced asset purchases , then the financials will be more careful about what price they sell to assets to the government .

This is very bullish for financials in the short run . <p> Also , do n't  forget that the SEC can always extend or reinstate the ban . Nobody thought that they would do it , but now that they have , it will be a smaller step to do it again .

He said Wachovia and BoA would do the best of the big banks becuase they wrote down the most losses already . Since BoA bought Merrill ( who I was slighlty bullish on after their Lone Star asset sale ) and Wachovia is undervalued relative to its peers , I 'd agree . Of course , then we start to diverge <p> His next pick was Goldman Sachs . Also , he said that all the banks would benefit because they could sell the assets for more than they wrote them off .

This is the crux of the matter : if the big banks write down the value of their Level 3 assets to Mark-to-Market value , then they would be technically insolvent . This is pretty much a fact . The real question has to do with whether M2M prices are too low .

Mortgages get split into mortgage bonds ( securitized ) , but then these bonds are further recombined and split again into CDOs . The CDOs have different interest rates and different equity stakes . So who exactly pays the premiums ? The mortgage originator ? The servicer ? The owners of the CDOs ( if so , how is this split among the tranches ? ? <p> 3 ) What happens if the premiums do n't  cover the claims ?

@@88485626 @3985626/ <h> Obamas Tax-the-Poor Policy <p> The IRS " early release " tax tables for 2011 can be found here . If you run through your numbers , you should find that the amount to be withheld has gone up , rather than down . That 's because the " Making Work Pay " ( MWP ) tax credit got axed in the tax deal . So , you should find a $400 increase . ( The 2010 tax tables are here . ) <p> Once you have that number , then you go on to calculate the amounts to be withheld for Social Security and Medicare . The Medicare rate is unchanged at 1.45% . Social Security is what has been cut . Instead of 6.2% , you now pay 4.2% . <p> Which is nice unless you are poor . Because in order to get an Obama-style tax cut , you need to make enough money so that the 2% reduction in the Social Security tax comes to more than $400 to make up for the loss of the MWP credit . If you are good at algebra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . If not , I will spoon-feed you : <p> Two percent of what will get you $400 ? <p> x * .02 = 400 x = 400/.02 x = 20,000 <p> So , if your taxable salary is more than $20,000 , you should see less withheld from your paychecks in 2011 . But if you make less than $20,000 ( $9.62 per hour ) , more will be withheld . How many people is that ? Millions . Many millions . Most of which probably vote Democratic . <p> Of course , there are other miscellaneous tax credits , mostly for people with children . But I should think that a sizable percentage of the Democratic voting base will see a tax hike in 2011 . Is Obama planning to run as a Republican in 2012 , or what ? <p> Note : As of this writing , the MWP is n't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article on the tax bill . I find it very odd that the MWP is hardly even being noticed since it has a large impact upon withholding for so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a bigger impact . However , the employer caught no such break making the impact 1/2 of what it could have been . Perhaps immediate expensing of commercial chattel was enough they thought . Several indys I know wanted the 2% reduction for the employer for *hiring* and *other business purpose* ( code for new wing addition ) ? Just kiddin business owners have been under the gun making morale less than kosher . <p> This is another method to get into an already established trend . An entry would be taken either above the high of the swing low candle or the high of the swing high candle for a long , and the opposite for a short . The neat thing about this is that the stop is close and well defined as the bottom or top of the entry candle .

@@88485637 @3985637/ <h> IWM Leads , but Ca n't Break Out Sort of <p> Yesterday , I mentioned that the market breakout was suspect until the small caps joined the party . Today , the IWM out-performed SPY and QQQ , but fell short of its rally peak of $83.31 . That intra-day peak came on February 17th , marked by the red arrow on the chart below . <p> However , the second panel on the chart is of closing prices . IWMs high close was $82.95 on February 3rd , marked by the black arrow . And as you can see , IWM closed above that level by an eyelash today , and also on Tuesday . <p> So , what 's more significant ? The intra-day high , or the closing high ? Answer : the closing high , because fund managers look at daily charts of closing prices and do n't  care about intra-day extremes . <p> Right now , fund managers are seeing a breakout on the IWM chart , and are thinking about coming in . If IWM can follow through in the next day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , this morning , the IWM was lagging until the " oil to be released from SPR " rumor hit the news .

Has the Russell 2000 been sulking , along with the transports , because of gasoline prices ? <p> The Dow Jones Transportation Average finished up 3.27% today . So , even though the White House denied the SPR rumor , the markets suspect that Obama sent a message to oil speculators . And that might mean that he is serous about not letting gasoline prices cost him the election . <p> In other words , there is a potential catalyst there that might cause the small caps and transports to join the breakout .

Libertarians like Lew Rockwell fall into the fool camp , and Republican Ann Coulter is an example of a slaver . <p> First , we already tried this . During the Great Depression ( before the minimum wage was adopted in 1938 ) wages found an equilibrium level below the amount where a worker could purchase enough food to stay alive . <p> How does the fabulous " invisible hand " solve that problem ? Easy , you just let workers starve to death until their numbers are reduced . Eventually , the supply of workers will fall to the point where wages rise to non-starvation levels . <p> And how long would that take ?

The peg , in fact , is the most protectionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to the brink of insolvency . <p> The Chinese implement the peg by buying trillions of US dollars .

They just print up boatloads of Yuan , their own currency . And guess what that does ? It creates inflation of China . <p> When OBombas fleet arrives over China and drops the nukes on the peg , the Chinese will have to either let the peg go , or inflate so furiously that a bowl of rice will cost $100 in no time .

Isnt that the underlying basis of being a communist country that has minimal imports of finished goods on the shelves ? As long as they keep bringing in TRILLIONS of dollars from exports to the U.S. , cant they just buy the raw goods ( iron ore , oil , copperi.e. , commodities needed to produce exportable goods ) out on the open market instead of buying bonds ? Furthermore , if they really feel threatened , cant they sell the bonds NOW before the dollar gets " Obombed " to a much lower value and move to other currencies or commodities to hold the value ? <p> Just trying to look at the problem from their perspective and wondering what their countermoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group ? <p> Nonetheless , people who think it is possible for Chinas growth to cause it to become a larger economy than the USA do n't  understand basic math .
