@@77877020 @6577020/ <h> IDX FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <p> IDX vs Advertising There has often been confusion over what constitutes IDX versus what is considered advertising . Many agents assume their IDX feed can be used for any type of advertising . While others believe the " Any Broker Advertise " field denotes whether or not a listing is included in IDX . Both of these are incorrect . IDX and advertising are independent of each other . For a breakdown of when the IDX Rules apply vs when Advertising Rules apply click here . <p> IDX ( Internet Data Display ) is a method for brokers to give consumers access to search the MLS on their personal websites , usually via a data feed . It is NOT advertising . When a broker receives the IDX data feed they enter into a contract with BeachesMLS which requires them to adhere to the IDX Rules and Regulations . Some of the top IDX rules to know are : Section 20.2.6 prohibits the use of the BMLS data for purposes other than IDX display Section 20.2.7 outlines the requirement for the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Listing Firm be displayed on of all listings obtained from BMLS Section 20.3.6 and 20.3.7 require the BMLS logo and disclaimer identifying the listings as BMLS <p> Advertising is a form of marketing communication used to promote or sell something , usually a business 's product or service . In real estate advertisements are often in the form of postcards , flyers , email marketing or third party websites like Craigslist and Facebook . It is important to remember according to Section 4.7 of the BMLS rules a listing shall not be advertised by any Participant other than the listing Participant without the prior consent of the listing Participant . When selecting " yes " for Any Broker Advertise* on a listing , it is the brokers expressed permission to allow other agents to advertise their listing in print or on the internet . The following requirements apply for advertisements : No false manipulation of the listing data , the ad must present a true picture and not otherwise mislead consumers . The advertising agent can not portray the listing as their own or belonging to their office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to the listing firm in a font that is the same size and color as the rest of the content . <p> Do I have to participate ? Not at all . But if you do n't  allow your listings to be displayed by other IDX participants , then you cant use their listings on your Web site either . Participation is decided by the Broker who may " Opt Out " of IDX . If a Broker chooses not to participate in IDX , the RAPB MLS Department needs to be contacted MLSsupport@RAPB.com . <p> How do I get IDX on my website ? You have four options . a . The 1st is the flexmls link . The flexmls link can be embedded directly on your website . To retrieve the link in flexmls go to Preferences then IDX Manager and scroll all the way down to " click here to get IDX 2.0 lite . " The link will then appear in the box to the right and can be copied from there . You will notice flexmls offers a few upgrades to that link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information contact 800-437-4232 ext. 108 or e-mail them at idx@flexmls.com** This is not to be confused with the link that is available through Florida Realtors ( FR ) and can only be obtained through them . b . The 2nd option is to use an authorized IDX provider . The authorized providers all utilize the same IDX feed however each one offers different products and features to display the feed on your site . A list of authorized providers can be found on the RAPB website at http : //www.rapb.com/mls/idx . Simply click on the vendors name to be brought to their website to view their offered products and pricing .

However , a strong redundancy structure can help a company combat many of the risk factors that come with hosting its website year round . Here 's a look at a few of the most prevalent benefits of redundancy in Web hosting , and what a company should look for as it selects a reliable partner . <p> Assurance in any situation The concept of redundancy is simple yet powerful - it 's about having a network designed for continuous availability when primary hardware shuts down or performance decreases . Servers are not invincible , and switching to a redundant location is widely considered the most effective way to avoid devastating losses and ensure uptime in uncertain situations . <p> CorpMagazine highlighted some reasons why redundancy is such a strong form of assurance for the modern Web-based business .

Furthermore , only 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the University of Texas . <p> Support from the experts It 's clear that redundancy is the right approach to Web hosting , but only with a great service provider behind the scenes . An article from CentriLogic explained that with the right vendor , " you do n't have to worry about maintaining IT hardware , managing an on-site data center , or monitoring your applications , " when something goes wrong . <p> " Redundancy is a matter of survival . " <p> This is a huge relief for an e-commerce company that already faces a wide range of challenges and ca n't afford to devote a large portion of its staff to downtime aversion . Decision-makers should know at this point that not all Web hosting partners deliver the same service and support - a rigorous evaluation is necessary to pick the best possible vendor and ensure that the redundancy structure is ready for anything . <p> Happy customers and staff Technical benefits aside , redundancy is truly a business-focused solution . Few things are more frustrating for an online shopper than an e-commerce website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold off on a purchase and wait for their site to function , the majority will quickly seek out a more convenient and reliable alternative elsewhere on the Web .

It is also a matter of trust for many shoppers , who want to ensure that their personal data is safe with their chosen vendors . Redundant Web hosting is a cost-effective way to build this sense of trustworthiness with a customer base that simply demands more . <p> For network stability , customer satisfaction and overall peace of mind , e-commerce decision-makers owe it to themselves to invest in a redundant server structure .

@@77877037 @6577037/ <h> Professional Standards : Pathways to Professionalism <p> Unbelievably , reports of agents giving out lock box combinations , or allowing unauthorized access to properties continues to be a major problem . Some agents may be tempted at times to give out a lock box combination because of a busy schedule . They may also think that it is okay because a property is vacant . It is never a good idea to give out a lockbox combination . <p> Recently , buyers were let in to a property before closing . They began tearing plaster away from the walls to begin a renovation project ; subsequently , the deal did not close ! There are more problems here than just the damageone of those unauthorized individuals working in the property could have been injured ! That would open-up some serious liability issues . In another incident , the agent gave the buyer a lock box combination to look at an REO property . The buyer noticed , just in time in the dark property , that the basement stairs were missing ! Again , that could have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISBO " , " Double-Pop " , and " Sign-Jumping " are just a few of the jargon terms we use in our business along with countless acronyms . Be sensitive to the use of industry terms that could be confusing or misleading to civilians ! Buyers/sellers may be intimidated or annoyed at language they do n't  understand . Use language that is easily understood to avoid communication problems . <p> You open the door to a showing and the kids charge in and head off in every direction . It can be difficult keeping track of wild kids . What makes it worse is that agents often report that parents are lackadaisical in controlling their children . It may be uncomfortable to say , but parents need to be reminded that children need to stay with you . Children are fast and can quickly break family heirlooms and other valuables by grabbing , or knocking things over . That is never a pleasant call to make to the seller or the listing broker ! <p> Share Information About Pets <p> It can be a frightening surprise when you 're showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not expecting ! Agents are put in a very tough spot not knowing if the animal is friendly or not . More often , the dogs are so friendly that the owners/listing broker forgot to communicate the pet information . However , those first few seconds when you come eye to eye with a strange dog in their domain can be very uncomfortable and perhaps dangerous . Moreover , many people are not at ease with loose animals . If animals must remain in the house , please communicate all information about the animals to agents showing your listings . <p> Animals , especially cats can often be " door darters . " It is a waste of everyones precious time when you are chasing a cat around the neighborhood or trying to coax it out from under the bushes ! This is time better spent in the house . Again , please remind showing agents to be aware if the sellers have escape artist animals . Better yet , see if these pets can be secured by the seller . <p> Call If You Are Delayed or Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not calling the lister when they need to cancel an appointment . Sellers become livid as they may have spent extra time cleaning , making arrangements for children and pets or adjusting their schedules for the showing . Not calling truly makes the entire industry look unprofessional and disorganized . The listing agent and RAPB often take the brunt of disgruntled sellers calls in these situations . Please remember to call and cancel appointments ahead of time . <p> Promptly Provide Showing Reports to the Listing Agent <p> This is a courtesy that has really fallen off in recent years . Showing reports can contain helpful information for the lister and seller . With email , providing a showing report has never been easier . You can simply provide a report the old fashioned way also by picking up the phone . Again , with cell phones , it has never been easier to take a few minutes and provide that showing report . <p> Leave Your Business Card : Do Not Leave Cards that Contain Advertising <p> Your business card is just that : a business communication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soliciting business from the seller , you may in violation of article 16 of the REALTORS Code of Ethics for interfering with the agency relationship of another REALTOR . <p> Leave Complete Information When Calling to Set Up Showings <p> This problem , although prevalent , seems to be most common for agents that list condo projects . Cooperating brokers will call the lister and leave a message saying that they want to show a unit and leave a cell number for the lister to call them back . This limited information creates a problem for the listing agent . First , the listing agent may not know who you are and what unit you are referring to . A cell number does not truly identify you . You can leave your cell , but also leave your office number and name . Criminals could easily pretend to be an agent , leave a stolen cell phone number and gain lock box combinations to listed property . <p> When you inquire about a showing appointment , please leave your name , company and office number . Also , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date and time(s) you are interested in setting the showing appointment . <p> PATHWAYS TO PROFESSIONALISM <p> While the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National Association of REALTORS establishes objective , enforceable ethical standards governing the professional conduct of REALTORS , it does not address issues of courtesy or etiquette . Based on input from many sources , the Professional Conduct Working Group of the Professional Standards Committee developed the following list of professional courtesies for use by REALTORS . <p> I.RESPECT FOR THE PUBLIC <p> Follow the " Golden Rule " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . <p> Respond promptly to inquiries and requests for information . <p> Schedule appointments and showings as far in advance as possible . <p> Call if you are delayed or must cancel an appointment or showing . <p> If a prospective buyer decides not to view an occupied home , promptly explain the situation to the listing broker or the occupant . <p> Communicate with all parties in a timely fashion . <p> When entering a property , ensure that unexpected situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business card . Do not leave behind business cards that contain advertisement . <p> Enter property only with permission even if you have a lockbox key or combination . Alert the listing agent immediately if the lock box does not open or malfunctions . <p> When the occupant is absent , leave the property as you found it ( lights , heating , cooling , drapes , etc . ) . If you think something is amiss ( e.g. vandalism ) contact the listing broker immediately . <p> Be considerate of the sellers property . Do not allow anyone to eat , drink , smoke , dispose of trash , use bathing or sleeping facilities , or bring pets . Leave the house as you found it unless instructed otherwise . <p> Use sidewalks ; if weather is bad , take off shoes and boots inside property . Consider the use of shoe covers in inclement weather . <p> Politely remind parents to keep track of their childrens activities as children can wander unoccupied , or handle the sellers personal property . <p> III . RESPECT FOR PEERS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other REALTORS . <p> Respond to other agents calls , faxes , and e-mails promptly and courteously . <p> Be aware that large electronic files with attachments or lengthy faxes may be a burden on recipients . <p> Notify the listing broker if there appears to be inaccurate information on the listing . <p> Share important information about a property , including the presence of pets ; security systems ; and whether sellers will be present during the showing . <p> Show courtesy , trust and respect to other real estate professionals . <p> Avoid the inappropriate use of endearments or other denigrating language . <p> Do not prospect at other REALTORS open houses or similar events . <p> Return keys promptly . <p> Promptly provide showing reports to the listing agent . <p> Carefully replace keys in the lockbox after showings . <p> To be successful in the business , mutual respect is essential . <p> Real estate is a reputation business .

It only takes one change to nullify code . <p> Check for code on each page . <p> Look for anomalies in data . <p> Keep notes ! Keep notes of your changes , especially if there are multiple people working on your site . Use the annotation tool . <p> This tool is available on all reports by clicking on the drop down arrow under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Make yourself familiar with how people get to your site . Check channels such as direct , organic , and referral traffic . This is really good data for SEO in particular ( link building ) . Additionally , once you know where people are coming from , you can change content to direct users to different parts of your website . <p> Look deeper in to referrals Find out where you are getting most of your visitors from <p> Look at your top landing pages ( Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; Landing Pages ) .

Exit Rate . <p> A bounce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately without clicking on anything , while Exit Rate is the percentage of views that were the last in the users session . Of these two pieces of data , Bounce rate is a more interesting number to look at , since these are users that are n't even staying on the page . <p> *Bounce Rate for a page is based only on sessions that start with that page. * <p> Top exit pages is the opposite of landing pages . These are the pages that people are leaving on . Do these URLs make sense as an exit point ? Has the customer left without reaching your goal ? It might make sense to add an exit survey on this page . <p> Note : A high exit rate is n't necessarily a bad thing ; this depends on the purpose of the page . A blog post can have both a high bounce and a high exit rate though you will want to try to drive traffic further into your site with specific content . <h> What Data Matters to YOUR site ? <p> Content sites <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be most important are : <p> Time On Site ( Audience &gt; Behavior &gt; Engagement ) " Aggregate data of session duration and pageviews per duration ( How long each person took on site ) <p> For ecommerce , the base level of what you have to worry about is sales/transactions and purchase goals .

@@77877114 @6577114/ <h> Ethics of a Short Sale ( Part 1 ) <p> Ethics of Short Sales ( Part 1 of 3 ) : A Sellers Ethical Decisions <p> by Karina Gafford MilitaryByOwner Staff Writer <p> Unfortunately , there is no denying that frustration pervades the entirety of a short sale situation . Even if the situation proceeds smoothly where the seller has received a clear pre-negotiated statement of what the bank will accept for the offer and the buyer offers the precise amount in cash with no contingencies , the sheer amount of time that it takes for the banknot to mention any secondary or tertiary investorsto approve the sale can cause considerable anguish among each of the parties involved in the transaction . This is not to say that a frustrating situation should encourage poor ethical decision making ; instead , when determining how to select the right ethical recourse in the case of a short sale situation , one must " Separate prudential , legal , and ethical concerns , " as authors Ron Howard and Clinton Korver write in their recent book Ethics for the Real World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain on high alert for any prospective instances that may make them either susceptible to making the poor ethical decisions or susceptible to becoming the recipient of the poor ethical decisions of another . <p> This article proposes to analyze the roles of the seller , real estate agent , and buyer in determining whether a short sale is an ethically good decision and whether it involves ethically good decisions also . Though only the real estate agent is required to submit to a professional code of ethics , each party involved in the transaction has a role to play in the decision making process . <p> Ethics and the Seller <p> In an article in the online press release magazine PR Log , acclaimed Las Vegas Real Estate Agent Tania Michaels asks rhetorically , " Is a short sale the act of dishonorable deadbeat or an act of grace by the lender ? " Her article discusses a question that plagues many would-be sellers who are stuck in a severely depreciated post-recession home , particularly when they face the prospect of a financially crippling , upward swinging , Adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of poor credit or negative home equity , meaning they simply owe too much to sell affordably and escape from the financial situation . Many would-be sellers , Michaels explains , remain concerned about the ethics of mutually agreed upon debt forgiveness when they expressly chose to accept the debt in the first place . She explained that she too , had to come to terms with ethically before making the decision to help these homeowners achieve debt forgiveness through short sales . <p> Affecting the Re-Sale Value of Your Neighbors Home <p> To better understand Michaels concerns , according to the National Association of Realtors , a short sale listing , otherwise known as a distressed listing , typically sells for 15 to 20 percent below market value , causing both the lender to lose money on its investment as well as the homeowners within the vicinity of the distressed property . Further , when one home in a neighborhood depreciates in value it , in turn , depreciates the value of surrounding homes . Why would individuals purchase homes at a higher rate when cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home at a lower value is also jeopardizing the value of his neighbors property , too . <p> Laws , morals and most religious principles require that individuals fulfill the terms of a contract ; however , these requirements are a little less clear when , as Michaels describes , the situation is beyond an individuals control , for instance , in the event of a depression or natural disaster . The agent concludes her analysis of the ethics of a short sale by explaining that in the event of a hardship , a short sale is the optimum ethical decision . The short sale allows both the lender to choose to forgive the debt and the homeowner to accept the terms of the debt forgiveness without simply walking away and leaving behind the messy situation of a foreclosure for the bank to deal with later . <p> Is it Special Treatment ? <p> One must also consider that by simply requesting the forgiveness of a debt , the homeowner is seeking special treatment . As Michaels explains , determining the hardship does require that the seller has honestly disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure of all accounts when applying for a short sale in order to determine that his situation is indeed dire . His neighbor , however , does not have a say in the transaction even though it will , in turn , depreciate his home further . The neighbor whose home is also likely severely depreciated may continue to make payments in order to fulfill his debt contract , choosing not to attempt to short sell or foreclose , but to the neighbor , the homeowner who does choose to short sell seems to be asking for an easy way out of a bad situation . <p> How to Determine if the Decision is Ethical <p> In order to consider whether it is ethically right for the seller to proceed with the sale , therefore , it is important to consider whether the decision he is making is honest , does not involve stealing , and does not involve cheating . Assuming that the seller has honestly disclosed of all accounts , is not concealing any financial information from the bank , such as an upcoming promotion or an inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale , and that by his short sale , his neighbor could also choose to attempt to short sell his own home , then the sellers application for a short sale is not an unethical decision . <p> Outside of disclosing accounts , an additional important disclosure remains in the hands of the seller : The property disclosure . Keeping in mind that the property is valued at less than what the seller owes , providing the homeowner the financial motivation to sell , the incentive for the homeowner to fail to disclose any issues with the home remains strong . Assuming that a true hardship exists , it is likely that the homeowner has not had the financial capacity to conduct regular maintenance on the systemsair conditioning , gas , water heater , pool cleaning motor , and etceteraor features of the houseroof tiles after storms , gutter cleaning , mold inspections , termite inspections , and etcetera . The homeowner may , therefore , be reluctant to disclose that he has not remained current on all necessary maintenance in the event that it scares away any prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer of a distressed property should expect to be on high alert for maintenance issues , and that any failure to conduct regular maintenance will be clearly evident either by the condition of features such as the lawn or to the third party inspector , it does not seem unethical if a homeowner fails to note that he has neither had a bi-annual air conditioning inspection nor an annual termite inspection . If , however , the homeowner has painted over apparent mold in the bathroom with the intention to conceal a water damage problem , knowing that the new buyer will have to remedy this problem , then the homeowner has acted unethically . Though it may be prudent for the homeowner to conceal the water damage problem , it is neither ethical nor legal , as the homeowner acted to deceive and is still subject to a lawsuit by the buyer for concealing this information . <p> When determining the ethical implications of the sellers situation , one must first consider if this is deceiving anyone , but as this tax situation does not involve intentional lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As there is no intentional cheating involved on behalf of either the seller or the lender , then this does not merit the label of cheating . Determining whether this situation involves stealing , however , is a little more difficult . On the one hand , the seller is not illegally stealing , as the law does not require him to pay tax on the deficiency . On the other hand , however , the tax code would require anyone in the situation of a conventional sale where he has financially benefited to pay tax on the increased value . In a short sale , no increased value exists , but the seller has financially benefited by the lender agreeing to a lower value , which in turn suggests that the deficiency amountthe $90,000 in our exampleis essentially an earned profit that requires a tax payment . Now , the likelihood that the seller can actually afford the tax payment is minimal , meaning that the seller would most likely end up in an even worse financial situation . Therefore , even though the seller has financially benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has earned cash in hand , making him able to remit a tax payment . Given this understanding , the seller is not acting unethically by not paying taxes on the deficiency amount .

@@77877122 @6577122/ <h> Impact of Eliminating Mortgage Interest <p> Tax time has come yet again , and this year military families should expect to see quite a few changes when it comes time to meet with tax advisors . Since it is always a good idea to look for the positive in any prospectively negative situation , some good news exists : The Basic Housing Allowance for military remains tax free , and in no way impedes the tax burden of military families . Other items , such as the teachers credit , a $250 tax credit that helps to off-set the cost burden of teachers who purchase resources for their classrooms , no longer exists . The removal of this deduction will definitely put a damper on the tax filings of the many military spouses and retired veterans who now serve as teachers . Despite its removal , this credit did not receive considerable media uproar . <p> Instead , the media has focused much of its angst on sensationalist tax deductions presented by congressmen and women this year for possible elimination , including the property mortgage insurance deduction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has bi-partisan support for its extension the under candidly titled Senate bill , " A bill to permanently extend the private mortgage insurance tax deduction , " ( S.688 ) . As of January 2014 , the bill remained in the Committee for Finance Reform . This bill , or at least the idea behind the bill , holds considerable public support ; the latter bill discussed , the mortgage interest deduction , meanwhile remains on the proverbial chopping block . The deduction is safe for this tax season , but recent research shows that controversy surrounds the deduction as it currently stands , suggesting that it may be ripe for reform , if not elimination . <p> What is Mortgage Interest Deduction ( and why should I care ) ? <p> Popular among the middle to high middle income class , the mortgage interest deduction offers families a tax reprieve . According to a recent study from the Reason Foundation , US taxpayers have technically had the opportunity to deduct mortgage interest since 1913 , though the deduction in its current form emerged in the World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeownership , the mortgage interest deduction neither benefits all homeowners nor even applies to all homeowners . Most families today believe that mortgage interest deduction is a good thing , according to the Simpson-Bowles Commission of the Obama Administration , which looked at options for fiscal responsibility and reform . However , given that the US tax code is so convoluted that multiple industries exist simply to help unpack the complexities of the code and explain it to the rest of us , it stands as no wonder that few taxpayers can clearly explain both whether and how the code applies to their particular circumstances in that particular tax year . If you are not entirely sure how this code applies to your situation , make sure to check for tax advisors in MBOs Business Directory to find someone who can discuss your particularities with you ! <p> With the rampant lack of understanding of the applicability of mortgage interest deduction , an ethos has emerged that proclaims that mortgage interest deduction encourages home ownership . Though whether this correlation is true remains in dispute . If , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the tax bill of most military families , then perhaps its elimination or reform may bring forth the possibility of tax benefits that would affect more of our families . If , as the current ethos stands , mortgage interest deduction does foster homeownership , then its elimination may detrimentally impact the ability of military families to not only resell their current homes , but also afford to buy a home at their next duty station . <p> Andrew Poulos , a columnist for the National Society for Accountants and Host of the Savvy Money Show , is an accountant who often works with military families to help them manage the complicated finances that result from regular moves across the US . Poulos firmly insists that eliminating the deduction will serve as a deterrence for homeownership , causing people to reconsider the benefits of renting when homeownership offers no tax incentives . Poulos suggests that the elimination of the deduction will have a significant impact on the choice military families may make on whether to rent or buy . For one , he explained to MBO , military families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as a result of a PCS . This means that not only will they not receive a tax benefit on their primary residence , but also if the housing market deteriorates as a result of less market demand from less tax benefits , then these families will be stuck with these homes . This will leave many military families as reluctant landlords , stymied by the headaches of maintaining investment rentals across the country without receiving any tax savings . Without the tax deduction , Poulos suggests , the market rental amount may not cover the cost burden of the property , as BAH is not designed to cover the cost of a mortgage and interest , so without tax deductions , the property may not be as affordable as it seemed . This cost burden may leave military families who are already vulnerable to financial distress from a regular lack of a second income as a result of a PCS in a bad situation . Renting , Poulos therefore suggests , may present a better option for military families . <p> Looking at the Numbers <p> To better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of the mortgage interest deduction , let us take a quick look at the numbers . Between 1994 and 2013 , the mortgage interest deduction has amounted to somewhere between $40 million and $85 million . Despite a generally upward trajectory of savings for taxpayers overall , the US Census Bureau shows a relatively stable homeownership trend , reflecting very little change overall in the percentage of homeownership throughout these years . This suggests that the deduction may have minimal , if any , impact on a familys decision to purchase a home . <p> In 2012 , only about 22-percent of the total number of taxpayers claimed the mortgage interest deduction . Families with incomes in excess of $200,000 received approximately 25-percent of the total tax benefit amount of $70 billion from that same year ; whereas , data from the Joint Committee on Taxation showed that homeowners with incomes below $50,000 received about 3-percent of the benefits of the deduction . Almost 77-percent of families in the former income bracket claimed the tax deduction that year , but only about 22-percent of families in the latter income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionate amount of the tax benefit went to a small portion of the population . <p> Based on these numbers , most military families do not fit the profile of those who stand to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction . According to the 2012 Demographics Report on the Military published by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense , over one-half of all Active Duty Officers are under the age of 30 while half of all enlisted personnel are under the age of 25 . The average age of an Active Duty service member is 28.7 . Of the total Active Duty force , enlisted personnel represent over 83-percent of the force , presenting a picture of an Active Duty military that is far too young to have the buying power and wealth bracket that would benefit from mortgage interest deduction . Unfortunately , the report did not cover the age range for the total military force , including retirees , so for the purpose of analyzing the effect on military families , we will use the average age of service members . <p> At an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlistedhas a base salary lower than $50,000 . As the data from the JCT above shows , few families with incomes below $50,000 are eligible to claim the deduction , and those who do claim it save less than $650 per year , a negligible amount when compared to the painfully high mortgage interest statement that arrives in the mail each January . Most families below that income bracket simply do not have a need to itemize their deductions for expenses , so they can not make the claim . The standard tax deduction for 2013 , for example , was $12,200 for married couples filing jointly , or $6,100 for individual tax returns . <p> The Mortgage Interest Deduction Bill in Question for 2013 . <p> Politicians are generally averse to taking a position against the deduction despite the discrepancies that exist in terms of who a ) receives the lions portion of the tax benefit and b ) the savings that the government could yield by either eliminating or reforming the tax code to provide a greater access to deductions across the board . In 2013 , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . The bill has received both adulation and condemnation , showing that any change to this stalwart of the tax code is highly controversial , making either the prospective progress or termination of this bill an interesting case to watch over the next couple of years ! <p> In March of 2013 , Congressman Keith Ellison ( D-MN ) of the House Financial Services Committee introduced a bill that would ultimately eliminate the mortgage interest deduction . Ellison presented the bill , commonly referred to as the Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2013 , H.R. 1213 , as a reform to the current mortgage interest deduction program . It would provide for a " phaseout of the tax deduction for mortgage interest between 2014 and 2018 , " with the intention of using the savings for programs such as those that would " increase the state housing credit ceiling for the low-income housing tax credit . " The bill currently has 13 sponsors in the House of Representatives who span districts all across the nation from Florida to Washington , showing that it has wide-reaching support . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House Ways and Means Committee , but two additional sponsors have withdrawn their support of the bill . <p> What Does the Research Show ? <p> Research foundations , such as the Pew Charitable Trust Foundation , show that the mortgage interest deduction unfairly benefits those with higher incomes , and in turn , reduces tax money that would otherwise be available for public housing programs . Public housing programs aim to provide housing at an affordable rate , which means that the occupant pays less than 30-percent of his budget for his housing expenses . Given the recent recession , affordable housing demand has grown while availability can not keep up . <p> Steve Brown , the brand new President of the National Realtors Association , disagrees with the Pews Report . He explained that tax deductions such as mortgage interest " were put there to encourage ownership and affordability , and its very important that these issues stay in the tax code .

If mortgage tax deductions did not exist for these second homes , too , he argues , then small communities , such as the Lake Erie Shore , where such houses are located would suffer detrimentally . <p> Other research institutes do agree with Browns position that the deduction is a vital part of the tax code . The Tax Foundation , a research organization that has been around since the Great Depression , suggested that , though legitimate concerns do exist for the reform of the deduction , the elimination of the deduction would cause disastrous results in the US economy to the tune of $254 billion in unspent revenue .

Evidence suggests that , though nice in theory , the mortgage interest deduction program in its current form may not offer the tax benefits to military families that , according to the Simpson-Bowles Commission , we believe it does offer . An elimination of the program may not see much impact for most military families , though a reform could stand to reduce the tax burden military families face each year . Regardless of whether the mortgage deduction currently impacts military families , any reform or elimination may require significantly more advance tax planning , Poulos warns .

@@77877133 @6577133/ <p> In a recent article , we discussed how real estate agents can help sellers price their homes and negotiate a successful closing through impartial mediation . Real estate agents offer additional benefits in the form of marketing and helping sellers avoid litigation , too . This article aims to define some of the ways in which an agent can help you both achieve a higher sales price on the sale of your home as well as avoid any legal pitfalls in the process . Should you choose to avail of the services of a real estate professional , MilitaryByOwners Business Directory can help you find one who works in your neighborhood ! <p> Is choosing a Real Estate Agent an option for you ? <p> Critics of using a real estate agent suggest that an agent is an unnecessary expense , particularly now when listings are relatively inexpensive through most online resources . In the age of easy online assistance for home marketing materials , home sellers question whether they still get good value for their money by using a real estate agent to help with the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former CEO of For Sale by Owner ( FSBO ) Colby Sambrotto showed in the challenging sale of his New York condominium , it is crucial to reach not only a wide audience , but also the most appropriate audience for the sale of a particular home . Prior to hiring a real estate agent , Sambrotto had spent six months trying to sell independently , but as his broker explained , he had not marketed his home at the right price point . When his broker finally did achieve a sale , he managed to garner Sambrotto $150,000 in excess of his original listing price . Through effective analysis of the market , Sambrottos broker proved that appropriate re-pricing of his property better positioned the condominium into a market where it would reach the most suitable audience . <p> Kurt Wannebo , CEO of San Diego Real Estate and Investments , explained that Sambrottos situation was pretty typical . Given that he was ranked number 73 in the country for real estate transactions last year by The Wall Street Journal , Wannebo knows what he is talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a property for 5 to 10-percent higher than any seller who has had no experience in doing so , " Wannebo explained . If , therefore , your house is currently listed for $200,000 , a real estate agent may help raise that price to between $210,000 and $220,000 . <p> A seller considering hiring the services of an agent , however , must also keep in mind that he must then pay a portion of that sale to the agent . For example if the commission is 6% , then that will go directly to commissions . To see how this works in effect , if the house sells for $220,000 , then $13,200 will go to commission . This does not mean , though , that the entire 6-percent goes to the sellers real estate agent ; the 6-percent is usually divided in two , so that both office of the sellers agent and the buyers agent each receive 3-percent , or $6,600 . This commission usually gets further divided between the agent and broker of each office , so the sellers real estate agent may actually only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares within each real estate brokers office . Assuming , then , that you had originally sold by owner for $200,000 , but an agent helped attain $220,000 , costing $13,200 in the process , you would net $206,800 , meaning that you would still have created a net gain by using an agent . If , however , you had sold successfully for your listing price of $200,000 , you possibly would still have had to pay commission for the buyers agent . <p> Then again , not every agent can achieve a higher sales price than an individual seller with great persistence and negotiating skills . A homeowner who can attract numerous offers , for example , can use those multiple offers to better bargain with prospective buyers to achieve a higher total sales price ; whereas , a real estate agent who puts forth little effort in the negotiations , however , may not achieve the same success . " Some agents do nothing other than list in the MLS ( Multiple Listing Service ) and hope that another agent finds the buyers , " Wannebo explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will spend a great deal of their commissions on marketing the property in order to bring in more buyersin the end this will sell the property for a higher price . " <p> One real estate agent who does know his market well is Charlie Fossett , an MilitaryByOwner partner who operates near Shaw AFB in South Carolina . As a local with intimate familiarity with many of the neighborhoods in the surrounding city as well as the marketing tactics that work best in his area , Fossett can expertly position houses at a higher price than a seller , or even another local agent , may otherwise list . In a recent sale , Fossett had a homeowner who had previously attempted to sell his house for $255,000 , the estimated sales price of the home which he had found through online market reports . After receiving no offers , he hired Fossett to sell his home . Fossett explained that no house in that particular subdivision had ever sold above $204,000 , so at $255,000 , the house would not receive any offers . After reviewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local market , Fossett and the homeowner determined that the house could list for $225,000 ; this was a price much lower than the online estimate , but significantly higher than what any other price in that neighborhood had ever achieved . Using an Open House , Fossett showcased the value of the property , winning over even the agents from outside his office who initially had balked at the high listing price . <p> Avoiding a Law Suit ! <p> Even for sellers who can successfully list and achieve a great sales price , many other pitfalls remain in the real estate transaction that , if not carefully navigated , can result in a whole host of legal ramifications for the seller . Not only can a buyer pursue a seller for problems with the home after the sale , but also the seller can expose himself to litigious situations during the marketing and showing process of the home , too . As Phil Georgiades , the Chief Loan Steward of VA Home Loan Centers , explains , " This is real estate and not a used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no understanding of real estate can wind up in hot water by not following the letter of the law or by misinterpreting how home sales work . " <p> An agent can help provide a buffer for any legal situation that a seller may encounter both during and after the sale of a home . The seller , for one example , must ensure the accuracy of all paperwork for the home pertaining to the sale when selling independently ; whereas , an agent or an a la carte broker can take on the responsibility of verifying the paperwork , including the Title Insurance , in lieu of the seller . In South Carolina , Fossett relayed , a seller must provide a property disclosure for the home in advance of closing . He also explained that in most states a seller must also provide a letter indicating a clean termite inspection , too . Since most homes are sold through agents , sellers rarely have to worry about taking the time to understand all of the paperwork involved in the sale of home , but more importantly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a law suit for failure to accurately complete the requisite paperwork and fulfill the terms and conditions of the sale . Wannebo warns , however , that as increasingly more homeowners choose to sell independently , lawsuits will increase , which he says will , " eat away at the profits for sellers with legal fees alone . " <p> The advertising and marketing of a property also presents many opportunities for litigious situations . An experienced , licensed real estate agent knows not to steer buyers to certain neighborhoods or to certain schools or school districts . Agents operate within the guidelines of the Fair Housing Act , a federal law under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that has enforced prohibiting housing discrimination since 1968 . Under this act , a seller must know that he may not use terms such as " safe neighborhood , " " suitable for married families with children , " " no stairs make this home perfect for an older couple , " or " historically African American neighborhood . " Further , a seller may neither refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer available for sale or inspection . Additionally , the act states that a seller may not change any of the terms or conditions based on a prospective buyers " race , color , national origin , religion , sex , familial status , or handicap . " Those who violate the terms of the act incur the possibility of hefty penalties . A real estate agent can help a seller avoid these costly legal pitfalls . <p> Advertising on MilitaryByOwner can be done with or without a Real Estate Agent .

@@77877156 @6577156/ <h> The Power of Coupon Marketing : 6 Facts You Need to Know <p> Remember those popular coupons you often get for grocery items , the ones which drive you to choose particular brands over others and which encourage you to buy stuff that you were not planning to get in the first place ? <p> Well , now they 've invaded the online world--- through what is known as digital coupons . <p> These days , digital coupons are very common . You can avail them from various websites to get discounts and freebies when you dine in a restaurant , watch a movie , go to a spa , have your nails done , or purchase gifts . They are certainly useful for a multitude of businesses , generating leads and bringing in more profits . <p> Before you decide to give coupon marketing a shot , though , check out these 6 facts that will surely help you decide if you really want to give it a go : <p> Fact #1 : Coupons Provide a Personal Marketing Approach . When a person receives a coupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mall , your business gets to communicate the advertisement on a personal basis . It 's like having a company representative give a one-on-one presentation to the prospective customer . <p> This is a great way to somehow avoid the same distractions that people usually encounter when seeing a commercial on TV or when an ad pops out while they are browsing the web . Coupons seem more private and personal . <p> Fact #2 : Coupon Marketing is Easy to Track and Evaluate . Of all the forms of marketing , coupon marketing is certainly one of the top-notchers when it comes to ease of tracking and evaluation . Since there are coupon codes that are monitored when bought online and when actually redeemed , businesses can easily keep track of them . Even those that are given out offline can be tracked upon redemption without any trouble . <p> In this case , marketers will be able to evaluate their efforts and find out how a particular coupon marketing campaign is doing . Are there many people seeking a certain product/service because of the coupon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for online ? <p> Moreover , when you gather information of people upon purchase and/or redemption , you can easily evaluate the demographics and buying patterns of your market . Such information will be helpful for the business in the long run . <p> Fact #3 : Coupons Work Well for Bargain and Deal Hunters . With the many competing businesses vying for consumers ' attention , it 's no wonder more and more people are trying to filter brands based on their preferences and priorities . Naturally , one of the top considerations is pricing . This is why a lot of individuals have turned into bargain and deal hunters . They are always on the lookout for the best deals . <p> Coupons are like hot cakes for these " hunters " . Since the Internet and social media have made the hunting process a lot simpler , it has increased the number of those seeking out the discount and special promo coupons . Besides , these people can easily google your business or check out reviews on blogs and forums to see if what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact #4 : Coupons can Penetrate and Stay with Customers . Unlike magazine ads and radio commercials , coupons have a greater chance of penetrating the life of a potential customer--- by being kept inside a wallet , being brought home , being carried around , being placed on the fridge , or even being passed on to somebody else . <p> Digital coupons , on the other hand , are able to penetrate email inboxes . Such an inbox is of course considered personal space on the web . Therefore , when you get to send someone a coupon through email , you 're already getting " in " somehow . <p> Fact #5 : Coupons Go Hand-in-Hand with Email and Social Media Marketing . Both email marketing and social media marketing are flourishing today . They are perfect tools for reaching out to people on a personal basis , establishing rapport , building a relationship , and gaining trust . <p> Coupons go hand-in-hand with these two types of online marketing because they can easily be offered via a newsletter or email message . They can easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google+ , and more . And because they are digital , it 's much easier for them to be spread to the networks of those people who have seen or received them . <p> For instance , you can offer an added incentive if they are passed on to others , posted on your timeline , etc . What 's even better is if you have an online store , people will find it much easier to make use of the coupon and get the reward immediately . <p> Fact #6 : Coupon Marketing is Useful for Collecting Consumer Data . Collecting consumer data is not just good for market research . It 's a great way to keep in touch with past and one-time customers and thus encourage them to do a repeat purchase , join your community , and be loyal customers . It 's also essential for generating new leads or increasing your conversion rate . <p> Coupon marketing can play a significant role in the collection of such information . Perhaps your coupon comes with a raffle ticket that has to be filled out with basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give you a set of coupons in exchange for your personal details . When you purchase coupons online , you also have to give your info . These are different ways that clearly exhibit the contribution of coupon marketing to consumer data collection . <p> Knowing these 6 facts about coupon marketing , you can probably tell that this seemingly old school form of marketing is still alive and kicking . It can definitely turn the tide and make your business go places , especially when utilized correctly and combined with other powerful marketing strategies . <p> Whether you intend to go for online or offline coupons , make sure to have them designed attractively but with clear-cut messages . Plan accordingly what you 'll be offering as well as how you intend for them to be distributed and redeemed . Enjoy the power of coupon marketing !

@@77877168 @6577168/ <h> The Science of Online Persuasion " Part 2 <p> Marketers have been trying to persuade people for centuries . From the street corner huckster to the modern day sales person , we are inundated , both consciously and non-consciously , with people working to influence our perception and convince us to take some type of action . <p> In Part 1 of this article , we discussed the principles of Reciprocity , Commitment/Consistency and Social Proof . For this article , we 'll look at three additional psychological principles - Authority , Liking and Scarcity . <p> Taken together , these principles have been extensively studied by Dr. Robert Cialdini and presented in his very popular book Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion . While the book was originally written in 1984 , these principles are immediately applicable to today 's digital marketing strategies and we use them here at Americaneagle.com for the A/B testing programs we run for clients . <p> Let 's look at these final 3 principles in more detail . <p> Principle #4 : Authority When we meet someone who has solid credentials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we tend to pay more attention to what they say and usually will defer to their ideas and recommendations . <p> Authority also works at a non-conscious level and when we feel a bit uncertain about something , a person of authority can usually tip our thoughts and perceptions quite easily . It 's normal human behavior that during times of uncertainty , we look outside of ourselves to find validation and guide our decisions . <p> How does this principle translate to your website ? Testimonials from legitimate recognized authorities can help persuade your site visitors to take action . The principle of Authority may seem synonymous with social proof , but social proof includes the thoughts/opinions of many , whereas the use of authority concentrates on the perceived expertise , status or power of a single person or business entity . <p> Here are some suggestions on how you can create a sense of authority within your own website . <p> Principle #5 : LikingThis principle is based on the psychology that we are more likely to comply with someone if we like them . The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shared interests . Establishing likeability online can be a bit challenging because there is no face-to-face interaction , but your About Us ' page is a good place to start . Not only should your About Us ' page establish authority and expertise , but it should also show the human side of your business . <p> Here are some other ideas and suggestions for establishing likability within your website : <p> Physical attractiveness " When it comes to websites , solid design , professional photography and attractive people can do a lot to draw visitors in . <p> Similarity " We naturally like people that are similar to us in terms of interests , opinions , personality and background . Understand your visitor personas and craft copy , headlines and value propositions that show you understand them . <p> Contact and Cooperation " We feel a sense of common purpose when working with others towards a common goal . For online businesses , this can be expressed by supporting charitable organizations or working to make your business more environmentally friendly . <p> Conditioning &amp; Association " We like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more favorable towards the products and services behind them . <p> Principle #6 : Scarcity Scarcity is a powerful principle that is tied in to our reptilian brain stem , which evolved to serve the needs of survival . When resources are scarce , people can act quite impulsively , leading to irrational behavioral responses . As marketers and business owners , we can use this natural base brain response to our advantage by creating a sense scarcity . <p> Here are some examples of how you might do this on your own website : <p> Limited number " Item is in short supply and wo n't be available once it runs out <p> Limited time tactics " daily deals <p> Holiday specials <p> Clearance Sales <p> One-of-a-kind specials <p> Anniversary specials <p> One-off special events <p> Pre-orders <p> One thing to mention is the importance of testing these principles on your website as opposed to just blindly following them and hoping for the best .

Read on to find out more about our great TTP team ! <h> What is TTP ? <p> Transportation Technology Partners is a division of Americaneagle.com . TTP primarily works with clients in the transit / transportation industry , providing exceptional web design and development services and ticketing solutions . Our ticketing solutions are ideal for transit and other ticket-related industries , for example the entertainment and event industry . <h> What is your background and how does it relate to TTP ? <p> I 've been in transit fare payment for 27 years of my career . I first started as a Revenue Systems Engineer at the Chicago Transit Authority ( CTA ) .

In addition , I managed the development and the maintenance of the Central Clearing House , communication infrastructure and the service support of the data system . I was the Technical Lead for the Chicago Card smart card system at CTA ; I worked with Americaneagle.com to design and develop the Chicago Card Plus account-based smart card web portal system . During my tenure at CTA , I was elected as the Chair of the American Public Transportation Association ( APTA ) ' s Fare Systems and Program Committee , appointed as the Chair of the APTA Universal Transit Farecard Standard ( UTFS ) Financial Management Committee and Co-chair of the APTA Transit Communications Interface Profiles ( TCIP ) - Fare Collection Working Group .

We created a new mobile ticketing app to allow customers to purchase and download tickets to their mobile phones to be scanned by the ticket inspector , with a counterpart app that verifies the tickets validity . We created a similar , revolutionary mobile ticketing solution for Pierce County Ferry , operated by HMS Ferries , in Washington State , and Cross-Bay Ferry , also operated by HMS Ferries , in Florida . <h> What makes Americaneagle.com a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the CTA to design , host and maintain their website ( www.transitchicago.com ) , built on idev .

Currently Americaneagle.com is also one of the subcontractors for this project , under Cubic Transportation Systems , to develop and maintain the Ventra web portal to manage user accounts and payment online . <p> Our breadth of experience makes us the ideal partner for ticketing projects of all kinds . With a background in web design and development , we can help with every aspect of your project .

These trends are the driving factors for change and improvement in our industry . Using them will help your business reach out to your customers today and well into the future . <p> Let 's examine a few of these trends we can expect to see in 2017 and beyond . <h> A focus on designing for content <p> High quality content is essential for the success of any website . Original and engaging content can attract new users and give them a reason to keep coming back while also providing crucial information to educate the main search engines about your site . <p> People visit websites for their content . Designs should let the content shine and allow the reader to focus on the message without a distraction from graphical elements or clutter . Personalization of this content will be the next evolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context will be delivered to the website user . <h> Flexible and large typography <p> As the web design world starts to focus more and more on content , we have seen the experimentation of creative typefaces that are big and bold being displayed on our websites . With more focus on typography design , these powerful typefaces can help accentuate the content and brand recognition . <p> Example : packerseverywhere.com <p> Large and bold typefaces have also brought on the trend of responsive and fluid typography . This is the notion that font sizes can adapt gracefully to different screen sizes . These techniques can ensure content is legible and improves accessibility across a wide variety of devices and viewports . <h> Smaller navigation and menus options <p> Now that a high percentage of website traffic is coming from mobile devices or smart phones , smaller and simpler navigation menus make it easier for users to find what they are looking for . More and more websites are starting to adapt website menus with three to five options . Less navigation options have proven to help visitors focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engaging micro-interactions <p> Micro-interactions are subtle , creative ways to interact with websites . They often come in the form of hovers , click-animations , or scrolling effects . <p> Example : ctia.org <p> These small , on-screen behaviors have begun to play an essential role in UI and UX design today . They help users understand what to do and what 's happening , while providing engagement and entertainment at the same time . <p> A great example of a simple micro-interaction you may be familiar with is the like ' button on Facebook . When a user clicks or touches the icon , it increases in size and turns color to inform the user of their action . <h> Use of bold color and gradients <p> A few years back , flat and material design became the norm throughout the web design community . This practice has a very functional purpose and still holds true today . Brands and designers have become increasingly aware of websites becoming all too similar , leading to a decrease in personality . <p> Example : emiratesusopenseries.com <p> We see this trend changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a resurgence in the use of gradients . New devices are now more advanced and producing richer color and vibrant hues . This will help brands focus more on personality and attract the attention of users . <h> Conclusion <p> 2017 is sure to see some great websites and designs with rich content and beautiful brand recognition . From the use of bold color , to engaging micro-interactions and animations , to smaller navigation menus - these are some of the trends you can expect to see in 2017 and beyond !

@@77877211 @6577211/ <h> Programs <h> Plastics Program History <p> Over 15 years ago , resin producers , automotive suppliers , molders , and independent testing laboratories all faced a similar problem : how to prove measurement accuracy when conducting quality assurance tests on plastics and films . With traditional destructive testing there were few reference materials available to verify instrument performance . The use of in-house control materials , while a valuable quality assurance tool to maintain day-to-day consistency of measurements , did not evaluate a lab 's ability to make measurements that agreed with other laboratories . Some companies attempted to determine the accuracy of their measurements through a round-robin program among three or four other facilities . This was often unsuccessful because the small number of participants made it difficult to determine a consensus value with a high degree of confidence . <p> Members of the industry who were aware of CTS other interlaboratory programs contacted CTS in the spring of 1991 , and all parties agreed to meet at the next American Association of Laboratory Accreditation ( A2LA ) Assessors Conclave .

A2LA auditors approached some of the D20 members , who then indicated they felt that CTS was the best and most likely organization to get a plastics testing program up and running . The chair of D20 appointed three committee members to serve as the CTS programs advisory committee , and three test methods were selected for the initial program tensile properties , DTUL , and flow rates . Thus , the CTS Plastics Program was initiated in 1992 at the request of industry , ASTM committee D20 and accrediting bodies . While initially the plastics tests were incorporated into CTS existing Rubber Program , it quickly became clear that there was little in common between the two programs . In 1994 , the CTS Plastics program was established as its own separate entity . <p> Not only did the number of tests offered grow from the original three to more than 20 , subproperties have been added to and refined in most tests to meet the needs of a demanding and changing industry .

An additional benefit of the CTS program is the use of " blind " samples . As the participant does not know what the result should be , the CTS program is a true assessment of the testing process including sample labeling and preparation , instrument operation , and calculation of the test result .

There are differences in each that distinguish them from one another . Depending on the quantity and type of products that your business is sending out , some carriers prove to be more economical . <p> So how can you figure out which is best for your e-commerce business ? There are a lot of different factors to consider . <p> Your Product(s) <p> Size <p> Budget <p> Tracking <p> Reliability <p> Destinations <h> FedEx <p> FedEx is a premium shipping carrier that offers varied services to shippers . This can range from air/ocean freight , extra care handling , and many more . <p> In terms of rates , FedEx is slightly more cost-effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business ships objects heavier than 3 pounds , it may well be worth it to use FedEx to have the reliability and versatility of a premium shipping carrier . <h> UPS <p> The majority of e-commerce businesses ship with UPS . Similar to FedEx , they offer a wide variety of services that range from Worldwide Express Freight to same day delivery . <p> Between the three of these carriers , UPS has the highest rates " yet as products increase in bulk , the more economical your shipping will become . If you are shipping large products with value attached to them , the prices for UPS bulk delivery prove to be the most cost-effective among all of these carriers . <h> USPS <p> There 's nothing like the good old-fashioned US Postal Service . And , at prices of first-class mail starting at just below $0.40 , it is very highly agreed that USPS is the best carrier for businesses looking to save the most money . <p> If your company is shipping small , inexpensive parcels " it would be most economical to ship with USPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carriers vs . USPS <p> While USPS is ultimately the most cost-effective with unbeatable prices , it is not the perfect solution for every business . Tracking is its biggest downfall . Unless you plan to pay for explicit overnight delivery , your parcel does not have any guaranteed delivery date and there is no sure way of determining when it will actually arrive to the doorsteps of your customers . <p> Tracking for UPS and FedEx are incredibly high-tech . Even the amount of time that the driver is outside of the truck is recorded . Reliability is one of the biggest reasons that companies choose these carriers . <p> However , just like any carrier " on time deliveries are not always guaranteed . An often unmentioned yet highly important guarantee that both of these carriers claim are 100% refunds on products that are lost , damaged , or late ( even by 60 seconds ) . <p> Many businesses believe there is nothing that can be done about inevitable late deliveries , yet this mindset led to about $2 billion of unclaimed refunds every year .

Some ship primarily with FedEx or UPS , yet save money by using USPS if a particular package is smaller or not as important . Likewise , many businesses use UPS for bulky ground/freight shipments and FedEx for overnight , or high-priority yet small products . <p> Overall , it is important to choose the carrier(s) that are the best fit to your business and its unique needs .

@@77877284 @6577284/ <h> Sitefinity 10 's New Modern Approach to Authentication <p> Sitefinity 10 introduces a number of bells and whistles to the platform , including some nice new features such as the Warmup Tool , the Health Check API , and some new-and-improved export and import functionality across multiple environments for content types and data . However , one area of the platform stands out as having received a major overhaul : authentication . Unlike the other new tools , Sitefinity 's new authentication framework looks like a modern re-invention of the authentication framework from previous versions of the platform . <p> To start with , Sitefinity 10 now comes out of the box able to integrate with other third-party OAuth and OpenID providers . That means that your users can log into the site using Facebook , Google , and Twitter , among others , without any custom programming work required . Additionally , Sitefinity 10 has drastically streamlined their Active Directory integration by allowing role mapping between Active Directory roles and Sitefinity roles . Whereas previously an existing Active Directory user would need Sitefinity roles applied to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the site , Active Directory roles can be permissioned as Sitefinity roles , allowing administrators to permission large groups of their users before they have even touched the Sitefinity site . <p> Outside of third party integrations , Sitefinity authentication has a few new modern touches . One of these is Site Shield , a new feature which allows administrators to hide a site in development from being browsed publicly . Individual end users can be invited by email to view the site , even without being added as a Sitefinity user or having Sitefinity roles granted to them . This is perfect for demoing a site in development to stakeholders without exposing any sensitive content or partially-complete marketing material to the public . This is a big step in empowering the site administrators and content authors with an ability that previously required a server technician or developer . On top of that , Sitefinity 10 streamlines roles and permission management in the back end . Finally , while it may only be a small quality of life improvement , Sitefinity now enables users to register using an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and password authentication is a growing trend in web development and it 's good to see Sitefinity enabling its site administrators to take a more modern approach to the end user experience . <p> Sitefinity developers should be advised that the new authentication behavior is accompanied by some API changes " most notably the ClaimsManager class has received an overhaul . One of the most common applications for ClaimsManager is to get basic information about the logged-in user in backend code , and that process has changed a little bit . The ClaimsIdentityProxy class has been removed in Sitefinity 10 , and looking up the current user will now return a SitefinityIdentity type instead . Fortunately , all of the basic user information in ClaimsIdentityProxy is preserved in SitefinityIdentity , but developers should take note that this change will need to take place when upgrading a site to version 10 if it contains custom code that looks up the current user . <p> The new SitefinityIdentity class seems to be a necessary step towards Sitefinity 's new integration-friendly approach to authentication . It inherits from the more generic ClaimsIdentity class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user identities from other systems , like Facebook or Active Directory . Ultimately , a few growing pains in the form of API changes were necessary in the process of modernizing and overhauling Sitefinity 's authentication . The Sitefinity development team at Americaneagle.com is eager to put this new integration potential to the test over the coming weeks and months .

This should enable you to carry the same items you have in previous years and speed entry into the stadium for all fans because it will take less time to screen bags . Shorter lines means fewer hassles . We encourage fans not to bring any bags , but have created a policy that balances fan needs with improved public safety and convenience . <p> Do I have to put everything I 'm carrying into the permissible bags ? <p> No .

Every member of your family may carry in a permissible bag . <p> What about diaper bags ? <p> Diapers can be carried in a clear bag . Each member of a family , including children , would be allowed to carry an approved clear bag and a clutch purse into the stadium . That is a quite a bit of storage capacity . <p> If I have special medical equipment I need to have with me at all times , where do I put that ? <p> An exception will be made for medical necessary items after proper inspection at a specified stadium gate designated for this purpose . <p> Will this policy affect the ability of fans to tailgate ? <p> No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lots and do so with greater safety and knowledge that entry into the stadium will be smoother and faster . <h> BAG POLICY FAQ <p> Why did the NFL and Eagles adopt this policy ? <p> The league and clubs review their public safety and stadium security policies every year looking for ways to improve them . The Committee on Stadium Security and Fan Conduct leads this review and obtains a wide range of information to assist in doing so . The committee strongly believed that it made sense to adjust our policy to enhance public safety and make stadium access more efficient by limiting the size and style of bags carried into the stadium . This was reviewed with the clubs at the May league meeting and will be implemented by every team . The public deserves to be in a safe , secure environment . This is about both safety and improving the overall fan experience . <p> Was this step taken because of what happened at the Boston Marathon ? <p> That was a factor to take into account , certainly , but we update and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can continue to adjust to the realities of public safety . The league had been discussing a new approach to bag restrictions before the Boston Marathon incident . <p> Are other events and stadiums limiting bags as well ? <p> Yes . In fact , some like the University of Michigan , Penn State , and Michigan State University do not permit any bags , while the TD Garden in Boston only permits clutch bags . The pat downs and metal detector screenings of all individuals entering NFL stadiums provide an additional level of safety for fans . <p> This will enable us to move fans through our security check points much faster . A standard size bag eliminates the need for bag templates to check bag sizes . It will allow staff to be more efficient and effective in checking bags that are brought into the stadium .

We will be sharing more information about this in the coming weeks . <p> How many bags can each person bring into the stadium ? <p> One large clear bag either a one-gallon Ziploc style bag or the 12 " by 6 " by 12 " clear bag plus a small clutch . The larger clear bag must be a standard 12 " by 6 " by 12 " made of clear PVC vinyl and is easily searched . The one-gallon Ziploc bag is readily available , inexpensive and easily searched .

@@77877303 @6577303/ <h> Maximizing Word-of-Mouth Promotion Using Google Plus <p> Experienced marketers from around the world would agree just how important word of mouth is when it comes to the world of advertising . It 's not only free of charge , but very effective too . After all , most people usually believe and trust those who are close to them and they like . This type of promotion can work like magic ! <p> Modern-day advertising is not that different , actually . You can still make the most of this old-fashioned style of promotion but with the added push of popular social media networks such as Google Plus . Since we essentially live in the social media age at present , it 's much easier to spread the word about something . Each Social Media platform caters to a specific type of end user , and Google Plus is most popular among professional men who are 28 and older . <p> Gathering Evangelists It 's not enough for you to post relevant content every now and then on Google Plus and expect a follower or two to repost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take an active position in looking for your own evangelists--- people who will willingly and enthusiastically share your content to others . <p> The first step in searching for such evangelists is to check out the followers that you already have . Who among them have you noticed are frequently sharing your content ? Who among them usually repost articles from the web , promos and announcements from other companies or businesses , and even statuses and images posted by commercial brands on Google Plus ? These are the people you ought to focus on . Encourage them to start sharing your content too . You can do this by posting viral and relevant content in diverse ways or even reaching out to them directly and offering incentives . <p> The second important way for you to gather evangelists for your brand is to search using hashtags . Which people on Google Plus are using and talking about your products and/or services in your field ? They are already interested , so they certainly make for ideal brand ambassadors for your business . Moreover , do n't just stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hashtags that are connected to your own industry as these may help as well . <p> Another useful means you ought to explore is Google Plus Ripples . This is how you can take note of the people who often share links of other users and influence others in this process . Here you can discover those who are considered the most influential within your industry . Get in touch with them to maximize your word-of-mouth advertising within this social media network . Ripples can be accessed by clicking the down arrow on the top of a Google Plus post . You can directly access the Google Plus users who have been most instrumental in making the post go viral . <p> Creating Engaging Content As you are gathering plenty of potential evangelists , you should also make it a point to regularly create engaging content . Once you have connected with these prospective word-of-mouth marketers , they are sure to check out what you post each day . Of course they 'll be more encouraged to share your posts if they are engaging , interesting , and relevant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aspect of promoting your products and services directly . You ought to avoid sounding like an annoying salesman . Instead , post more quotes , images , articles , statuses , and videos that you believe are likely to capture your target audience and pique the interest of your evangelists . There should also be a variety in your content . From time to time , you may want to also share significant industry news and updates . <p> Furthermore , you ought to encourage interaction by posting questions or asking people to vote on something . For instance , if you sell wedding gowns , you may want to ask your audience to choose between two designs for a specific theme . Or if you are offering ebooks , you can ask people to comment which is their favorite book and why . Interactive posts have great potential to become viral . <p> In addition , you should try coming up with your own hashtags and promoting them . When you 're promoting a newly launched product or holding an online contest , you can ask people directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and expand your reach , in addition to the big help of your evangelists . <p> Offering Special Incentives A person who had always been active on Google Plus , has established a huge network already , and loves to repost and share content is already doing word-of-mouth promotion without receiving anything in return . Often these people simply enjoy doing so , and will surely appreciate special incentives as an added bonus to continue doing what they already do on a regular basis . <p> When you offer these Google Plus users such incentives , it 's just a way of asking them to check out your brand and include some of your content in their daily reposts . It 's also a way of somehow redirecting their attention and simply rewarding the effort . <p> You ought to contact these people via a private email . Through this email , you can state your request , outline your offer clearly , and describe the incentives or bonuses . You may ask them to opt into an exclusive mailing list for all evangelists . But be specific with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that offering incentives is not a one-time deal . You need to build and maintain a good relationship with these marketers as they may become your lifetime partners in growing your business through Google Plus . <p> Now that you 've gone over these recommendations , you ought to also familiarize yourself better with the social media network itself . Knowing the ins and outs of Google Plus will further guide you in continuously developing word-of-mouth promotion through your own evangelists . <p> Indeed all of the steps above will lead you to establishing a stable group of promoters who will utilize social media and make use of word-of-mouth marketing to increase your customer base and business profits in the long run .

@@77877308 @6577308/ <h> The Cost of Getting Related Items in Sitefinity 's API <p> Back when Sitefinity 7 released , one of the biggest enhancements was the addition of related data fields to all content modules . This had a huge impact on our existing Sitefinity websites and we rarely build a site anymore that does n't use related data to some degree . Custom slideshows , banners , news , staff directories , and many dynamic modules on our sites use custom data to relate to media and other content types . Related data is a cornerstone for our Sitefinity websites . <p> We measured the time that it took Sitefinity 's API to pull related data out of the CMS as a result of assessing performance on a recently launched site 's homepage . The homepage has a scrolling activity feed that loads more automatically when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page . We decided to build a dynamic module for managing this , since a feed item on a site could be a news article , event , photo gallery , or a video . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to consolidate this activity feed into a single module . <p> To assess the time needed to get all these items and pull out some of their field values , we created a page that listed all the current feed items and logged some data : <p> As you can tell , there is n't much going on here . We 're just reading the flat string values from these fields . There were a total of 19,775 items when running this code and it took 25.16 seconds to execute . Not too bad , but we 're also not dealing with related data fields either . <p> Next , we added lines for pulling from a related image field and related data ( dynamic module ) field : <p> Total time to execute was 11 minutes 47 seconds . This is substantially slower than the previous method , and we 've only added 2 related data fields ! <p> At this point we determined that there has to be a more efficient way to get this data without having to cast everything into memory just to parse it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious way to get related data , but we figured there must be a faster way . Sitefinity 's database is still just tables after all ; we should be able to pull that number of records much faster . <p> We know that there are really just a few tables we care about . There 's a table for storing the custom fields for the dynamic module ( feeditems ) , there 's a table for storing Dynamic Content specific fields ( sfdynamiccontent ) , a table for the media data ( sfmediacontent ) , and a sfcontentlink table that manages all of these relationships . Fortunately , there is a ContentLinksManager in the API that let 's us see directly into that relationship table , and we can leverage that to speed up the process . <p> Here 's the equivalent snippet , but using ContentLinksManager for getting those related items . Before looping through anything , we grab IQueryables for the feedItems , sponsors , images , and contentlinks . <p> At this point we know we can pull all the data we need , we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get , we look up its associated RelatedSponsor and FeaturedImage in the content links table , and then use that link to find the first instance in their associated data tables . <p> This snippet has the same result as the earlier example , but finishes in 2 minutes and 47 seconds . While this is a ways off from 25 seconds , it 's quite a bit better than the GetRelatedItems method . <p> This is definitely an improvement , but it is not a universal way for getting data out . We 're still just grabbing the first RelatedSponsor and Image , we 're not getting a list of relations , which would require some joining work with those IQueryables , so there 's more work needed for that scenario . It 's also possible to get all related content links straight from a Dynamic Content item , which might be a better way for what you 're trying to do . These are just a few items to keep in mind when dealing with relations and finding the quickest way for your solution .

The biggest restriction is that the influencer must disclose if they were paid or compensated in any way by the brand ( whether monetary or by receiving free products or services ) . <p> Early on , marketers witnessed the influencer technique rise in popularity with bloggers . This earned marketing stemmed from unpaid or preexisting relationships with influencers who were natural brand advocates and often mentioned products for free . However , bloggers and those with larger social reach soon realized their value in the equation and looked to capitalize on it . That meant an increase in the number of sponsored posts and available paid placements whereby bloggers would certainly mention a product , but only if they were compensated ( paid media ) .

They help you understand your customers ( and prospective customers ) better , and make it easier for you to tailor content to the specific needs , behaviors , and concerns of different groups . " <p> At the most basic level , personas will allow you to personalize or target your marketing for different segments of your audience . So for instance , instead of sending the same lead nurturing emails to everyone in your database , you can segment by buyer persona and tailor the messaging according to what you know about those different users .

@@77877353 @6577353/ <h> Programs <h> CTS Wine Program History <p> In the late 1990s several companies in the North American wine industry recognized the importance of a strong laboratory quality assurance system , as well as the risks and costs associated with poor measurement performance . Interlaboratory testing was deemed an important piece in any laboratory 's quality system . The American Society for Enology and Viticulture ( ASEV ) became a lead advocate for establishing formal quality systems in winery laboratories . In 1999 the ASEV Analytical Quality ( ad hoc ) Committee developed a CD showcasing highlights of the principles of winery laboratory quality management to assist wineries . This ASEV Technical Projects Committee ( TPC ) sub-committee later became the ASEV Lab Proficiency Testing Guidance Committee ( LPTGC ) which acted as a liaison body for this wine program with CTS from 1990 through early 2010 . <p> In the absence of an industry organization to set standards , CTS interlaboratory programs often employ a " bottom-up " approach in which all evaluation criteria are developed by participating laboratories .

Events proceeded quickly and by March 1999 samples were being sent to laboratories for the first interlaboratory trial . Two published articles on lab proficiency in the American Journal of Enology and Viticulture ( AJEV ) reference the CTS data or the Quality Systems for Winery Laboratories CD . <p> The CTS wine program evolved with time . One of the first changes ( 2001 ) was switching from a quarterly program to a triennial schedule , allowing laboratories with limited staff to fully participate without compromising the crush season . Also in 2001 , rotating research properties were added to explore new properties and to allow testing in previously uncovered areas . A Quality Managers Report was developed in 2003 to enable wineries with different locations and multiple laboratories to monitor results across the entire organization . The next program outcome was to give new insights about the differential performance of the multiple assays used to measure the nominally same properties . CTS made a special presentation on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CTS to offer two different analyses for sugar content that year and two method-based results being included in every web report .

If you have even the slightest inkling about SEO , you know that it 's essential to incorporate relevant keywords in your website , blog , social media posts , and other online promotional materials . Of course , there are particular tactics you will need to apply in order to get your desired results . <p> Currently , long-tail keywords are all the rage . It 's not enough to simply research the essential keywords that could lead people to your business when they are using search engines like Google . Online marketing specialists have been stressing the great importance and proven effectiveness of utilizing long-tail keywords more for SEO purposes . The long-tail keywords have become even more important since our dependence on smartphones because of the way users ask questions . People do n't use keywords when they ask " Siri " ; they ask " Siri " questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keywords , Anyway ? If you are selling flowers online , some of the common keywords you may use are " online flowers " , " flower delivery " , " order roses " , and " free delivery " . But if you 're going for long-tail keywords , you 'll have to make use of more specific keywords which often consist of three to four words or even more . <p> One important characteristic of these types of keywords is that they 're extremely specific to what you are offering . Hence , those who use such search phrases are likely on the hunt for your actual product or service and will likely buy it as well . <p> In the given example above , the long-tail keywords relevant to your business may include " where can I buy roses and chocolates online " , " Who has pink rose delivery worldwide " , and " Valentine 's gift flower package for my wife " . When you target such keywords , you 're more likely to draw the attention of qualified prospects . It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as boost your conversion rate . <p> How Can Targeting Long-Tail Keywords Benefit You ? If you 've been doing Internet marketing for quite some time now , you probably realize that pure traffic is not sufficient to increase your business profit . Perhaps it can help you establish a stronger brand presence and reach out to various audiences , but it 's obviously better if your website visitors actually become paying customers . <p> This is where long-tail keywords come in . <p> These keywords probably wo n't increase your website traffic . However , you can be assured that the traffic that they do bring will be valuable . These site visitors are much closer to the point of purchase than typical visitors to your website . You can expect a greater and faster return on investment from them . <p> What 's even better is that with long-tail keywords , you have a clearer shot at a higher ranking on search results . Is n't this is one of the goals of SEO ? Thus , you can maximize your efforts when you target such keywords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate the keywords " lace wedding dress with sleeves " and " vintage lace wedding gown " into your guest post about bridal preparations or into your article entitled " The Best Wedding Dress for Your Body Type " . <p> Do you know that using long-tail keywords will also drop off some of the other competition for traffic ? Yes , this is yet another benefit you can enjoy . With lower competition , you 'll have a larger number of qualified prospective customers visiting your website . Furthermore , you wo n't have to pay as much when going for paid ads and paid search marketing campaigns . This is because the CPC ( cost per click ) is essentially lower due to lesser competition . <p> Regarding the competition , you ought to realize too that with shorter and more generic keywords , you may unnecessarily be taking on the giant companies in your industry . Let 's say you wish to promote your new laser liposuction services . If you use broad keywords like " liposuction " , " weight loss " , and " fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Health.com . More people may head over to these sites rather than to yours . But if you use long-tail keywords such as " laser lipo for arms in Chicago " , " California laser lipo services " , and " non-invasive stomach fat removal in Fort Lauderdale " , you 'll have potential customers going to your website and checking out your services . <p> Here 's another advantage of multi-word , definite keywords--- Google 's applause . Yes , you read it right . Google loves more content . When you target long-tail keywords , you 'll have a longer list of keywords that you will need to write about . As a result , you will end up creating more pages and writing more blogs and articles . And when this happens , Google is more likely to give you attention and thus improve your ranking on search results , though you 'll still have come up with relevant and well-written content . <p> How Can You Discover Long-Tail Keywords ?

Developers already working in the platform were ecstatic to see the changes it brought , and it has also caught the attention of those who have not previously worked with Sitefinity . <p> It has been almost two years since that initial build and the excitement of this project continues to generate momentum . Many of our current and prospective Sitefinity clients have asked us about including this add on into their current or future project . <p> Unfortunately , if you are not a developer , knowing exactly what Feather does is not easy to understand . With its rising popularity , I hope to clear the air for all of you curious non-developers.What is Project Feather ? Essentially , Project Feather is Progress 's response to keeping up with the always advancing world of development . Paving the way for MVC only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Bootstrap ( which comes default ) - Feather is a complete re-design of how all developers work within Sitefinity . <p> What does this mean for your site ? If you 're not developing , the term MVC and perhaps even Bootstrap may not mean much to you . Bottom line , this means that developers are able to create your site using the newest coding practices with access to more tools , such as better out of the box access to making your site responsive.What changes will you see ? <p> For one , a revamped page editing screen . If you have used the Sitefinity page editor in the past you will be happy to see the new Bootstrap inspired widget editors : <p> Sitefinity Feather ( Left ) vs . Sitefinity w/o Feather ( Right ) <p> Other than that most of the changes that occur happen behind the scenes . One major item to note is that Feather should generally improve site performance compared to older Sitefinity sites " but site speed will vary on a case by case basis . <p> Some common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feather that we are often asked : <p> Is Feather a separate product from Sitefinity ? <p> No , Feather comes with all new versions of Sitefinity and will be enabled by default on Sitefinity 9 and up . It is simpy an add-on to the CMS . <p> Does Feather change how we use the CMS ? <p> No , your CMS experience will see little impact with Feather enabled <p> Do i have to use Feather if it comes with my site ? <p> No , although it is enabled by default in Sitefinity 9+ , you can disable it and use the old approach <p> Should your site be developed in Feather ? <p> While all of the above sound great , whether your site should be developed in Feather is still a question worth considering .

However , if a tool is not present in Feather yet , developers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to consider is the status of your project . If you are starting up a fresh project on Sitefinity " Feather should absolutely be used . While Progress will continue to support the old method of development , new features and widgets will likely only make their way to the MVC only approach of Feather . <p> If your site is using an older version of Sitefinity ( pre-8 ) or has already been built on a newer version , Feather would require an overhaul of the developed code . <p> Looking forward <p> Progress has a lot of great changes coming in the near future with Sitefinity version 9 and up , much of it guided by the success of Project Feather . These include a completely revamped admin UI , support for new widgets ( such as multi-step forms ) and an everlasting flow of improvements and bug fixes . <p> Americaneagle.com has been following Project Feather very closely for some time and we are excited to answer any and all questions you have about this subject !

When shopping for Jeans , consumers often have more information about what looks good on their body type , than which style home would best fit their lifestyle . Every mens and womens magazine has run multiple articles on what looks best on your body , but there are few resources out there to help you " try on " house styles ! What fits you and your family ? ? From Colonial to apartment , let 's try some on . <p> Colonial : <p> The most common home style and one with the broadest appeal . A typical colonial home has a first floor of 3-4 rooms : Kitchen , Dining , Living and/or Family Room and a half bath . Second floor will have bedrooms and full baths . <p> Most colonial style homes have a basement , and if unfinished it is an excellent way to later improve the value of the home . Colonial homes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken into distinct rooms , in contrast to a " great room " west coast style home . A big thing to consider in colonials is Stairs . Because of the traditional high ceilinged colonial floor plan , staircases are long . Keep this in mind if you have anyone that may have difficulty with stairs in your house . Overall , colonials appeal to the broadest base of buyers . <p> Split Level : <p> A home style that rose to popularity in the 70s , split levels are rectangular homes with a stairway right inside the front door . A half course of stairs goes up to the top level , generally 6-8 steps . And an adjoining stairway leads down to the lower level , generally 6-8 steps . The upper level usually contains 6 rooms ; three bedrooms , kitchen open to dining room with a larger living room in the front . <p> The lower level can be arranged in a variety of ways , often containing a rec room or additional bedroom/bathroom combination . The laundry area is almost always located on the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are often favored by those looking for a home either with an existing or potential for an in-law apartment . The Split level configuration lends itself well to a three room basement area , as well as the six rooms upstairs which can function just like a ranch home . <p> Ranch : <p> A Ranch is a one-level home . In Northern States , they usually have basements which are often finished to increase the living area . In the south , these homes are usually built on slabs because of increased risk of flooding in more humid climates . <p> Ranches often feel slightly bigger than a corresponding colonial of equal square feet , because the lack of stairs eating up interior living area .

Unlike apartments or condo you enter directly into unit from outside . Usually they have some sort of outside patio and/or deck area for each individual home and common play areas that are shared by all . If there is a garage it is attached . At least one side wall usually shared , back wall may be shared or open to the outside <p> Townhomes can be significantly less expensive than individual homes in the same area but come with some compromises . In a townhome you will share at least one , and up to three common walls with other residents . Dependant on the quality of the structure , and the neighbors , these could lead to some uncomfortably close " noise " situations .

In this form of ownership , you own the inside of your unit and have a percentage ownership of the land and common areas of the development . You do not own or have the right to change the exterior of the unit . Every condo project has its own homeowners association ( HOA ) that is responsible for maintenance of common areas and enforcement of HOA policies and restrictions . <p> Condos are most often one level housing in a multi-level building that share entry and hallways . Multi story condo units will usually have an elevator . A benefit to condo is that they usually have a security system , sometimes with onsite security guard and/or caretaker . They may have heated underground parking , parking in detached garages , assigned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a party room , and may also have shared amenities such as pool , exercise room , and tennis courts . <p> Condo association fees include heat , water/sewer , trash removal , snow/lawn care , outside maintenance and hazard insurance . Some also include electric . Laundry more often shared , but may also be in unit . Usually there is a central heating/ air-conditioning plant that is maintained and owned by the Association . <p> As with Townhome ownership , you need to consider sharing multiple common walls and common areas with your neighbors . Privacy and noise can be an issue or an easy compromise in light of the lower cost of owning a condo.

@@77877425 @6577425/ <h> 3 Marketing Strategies to Increase Customer Loyalty <p> Modern retailers are struggling to stand out amongst the many marketing emails , advertisements , and promotions consumers see daily . More connected than ever before , these consumers use smartphones to research products instantaneously " and if your product is overpriced or you do n't have the correct size or color in stock , you can bet they 'll find a similar version elsewhere . <p> In this age of the connected customer , it can be difficult to foster loyalty and gain repeat shoppers . However , it 's a challenge retailers should put effort into overcoming , because loyal customers are worth more to your business since , over the course of a year , the average return customer spends over 120 percent more than new customers . In order to tap into this profit , here are three marketing strategies that can help you gain more loyal customers : <p> When thinking about promotions , do n't email blast your entire customer base . We 've all received the 30% off email that practically begs us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alternative to promotional spam is a promotion for a specific network or event , as 33% of consumers have acted on a promotion on a brand 's social media page . Consider an Instagram only Valentine 's Day promotion - when your followers see that they did n't see the promotion on your other social media channels , they might follow you just in case you have a Memorial Day promotion . <p> 2 . Consider supporting a cause you care about <p> Since 85 percent of consumers prefer businesses and brands that support a charity they care about , philanthropic campaigns or events are a great way to boost business while making a positive impact on your community . Additionally , 75 percent of Millennials ( who have enormous purchasing power in the U.S. ) said it 's either fairly or very important that a company gives back to society instead of just making a profit . Hosting an event , creating a campaign , or donating proceeds to a certain philanthropic cause are all ways you can promote your brand while gaining customers ' trust and loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media <p> An active social media presence is an incredibly cost-effective way to create engagement and foster loyalty . For example , ask customers via social media to post a picture of themselves wearing your product . Have them tag your company and from these submissions , select a winner at random for a $100 gift card to your store . Your customers are then helping market your brand to their own followers , and in the process of winning a prize or even being reposted or retweeted by your brand 's official account , they will feel more brand-loyal . <p> You can directly influence your bottom line by leveraging customer advocates , and you 'll fall behind when your customer experience is n't worth sharing . While it 's certainly important to create brand awareness with consumers who have n't shopped with you yet , it 's imperative to put effort and resources toward potential brand advocates .

Even though it 's still relatively new to the social networking scene , Pinterest is already having a significant impact for businesses , as it has become the 3rd most popular social media channel in the world . <p> Pinterest is incredibly simple and can make a huge difference for your business as it 's exceptional at driving traffic to your site and generating more leads and sales . Here are 3 key reasons why you need to consider Pinterest for your business today : <p> 1 . Converting Browsers into Buyers <p> What 's impeccable about Pinterest is that compared to most social media sites , it reduces the amount of steps from discovery to conversion . Visitors to your site from Pinterest convert into leads or sales faster than from Facebook or Twitter . This is because the see it , like it , buy it ' action happens quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire a user has for an item . Once they see a picture of it , they are only one or two clicks away from actually purchasing it . In fact , according to a report by marketing intelligence from Visioncritical , nearly half ( 47% ) of Pinterest purchases say they pinned and purchased something after simply stumbling across it on the site . 29% said these were impulse purchases , as they had never even planned on buying that item . <p> 40 million monthly active Pinners is a large pool of potential visitors you can pull from into your site . If one of the main purposes of your website is to generate sales and marketing , you need to increase traffic to make this happen . And Pinterest is an ideal tool for increasing links back to your site , and therefore , driving traffic . That 's because every pin is literally a link leading back to the source of the image . And 95% of these pins were originally pinned or re-pinned from the web . <p> There 's a lot of research that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers back to a website in comparison to other social media channels . <p> BuzzFeed first saw an increase from their Pinterest traffic in 2012 when they posted an article for DIY projects . Since that post , they have experienced over 2.3 million views and have expanded their post categories . Pinterest is now their second largest social network referrer , and also generates longer lifecycles . BuzzFeed reported that traffic from Pinterest goes to posts that were published more than 2 months ago . Piqora analyzed their customer 's data from January - June of 2014 and concluded that the referral traffic from Pinterest increased 8.3% in comparison to the previous year . <p> They also discovered that the average visit-per-pin increased 172% and the average page views-per-pin escalated 304% ! <p> Even bloggers have seen great success with Pinterest . Take Kate Bryan for example , who blogged about her interests and hairstyling profession , but at the start had only 7 readers . Once she started pinning her work on Pinterest , incoming traffic skyrocketed and she quickly gained 16,000 blog subscribers in few short months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These stories are only the beginning , and prove that each of your pins has the potential to drive more traffic back to your website . <p> 3 . Learn More About Your Audience <p> It 's no secret that knowing your customers ' needs and interests is at the center of every successful business story . When you have this knowledge , you can use it to your advantage to influence your customers and truly engage with them - and an engaged customer is more likely to convert . <p> With Pinterest , you can learn about new trends and then use that information to position your own offers and products . You can even discover what your customers love to share and what inspires them . Pinterest users ' likes and interests are easily viewable for the public to see . They pin products they love , places they enjoy , foods to indulge in , things that make them laugh , and more . They 're volunteering a lot of personal information in a more natural way on Pinterest than they would in a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all this information at our fingertips and it can provide powerful insights about our target consumers . <p> As Pinterest continues to pick up steam in the social media world , we anticipate there will be even more great reasons to leverage this popular channel . What do you think ? Will you create a business presence on Pinterest for your marketing efforts in 2015 ? And if you 're already using Pinterest to your advantage , what tips would you add ? <p> If you 'd like to learn more about optimizing your businesses through social channels , contact us at **26;1194;TOOLONG today , and start making your social media strategy more intriguing one pin at a time .

No worries--we recorded it for you ! <p> The webinar featured a live iPad demonstration of the GoodLife Team 's 5-step listing presentation . Watch the recording below for complete details , then click through to the next page to follow along with our notes . <h> The 5-Step GoodLife Listing Presentation for iPad <p> Evernote is one of the GoodLife Team 's three " must have " apps . Presenter Garry Wise has multiple notebooks set up in Evernote : Prospective Clients , Buyers , Sellers , Closed , Templates , etc . Within " Sellers , " he has a notebook for each of his listing clients . He chooses the client notebook of the current listing appointment and begins walking us through the five steps . <h> Step 1 : Understand Your Seller 's Concerns <p> Begin by reviewing the information you gathered during the initial phone consultation ( contact info , best time to reach , where lead came from , interests , concerns , etc. ) and make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to collect and organize all of this information . <h> Step 2 : Inspect Property with Client <p> As you tour the home with the client , note what is needed to prepare the home to sell for its highest value , like repairs or staging . Use another Evernote template where you can note home features , recommended repairs , and anything you need to start marketing the home . <p> If you ca n't type fast enough to document home features , just click the microphone icon at the top of Evernote to record audio . When you 're done recording , Evernote will then drop the audio file wherever the cursor is in the document . Likewise , you can use the camera icon to take photos and save them in the document . <h> Step 3 : Marketing Plan <p> The next step is use Keynote to show the client your marketing plan . See the GoodLife Team 's example below . <h> Step 4 : Pricing Conversation <p> Visuals are far more potent than words , so during the crucial pricing conversation , Garry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create this from scratch , or import graphs and draw over them , as necessary . All Skitch drawings can easily be exported to Evernote and saved in the client 's notebook . <h> Step 5 : Listing Agreement <p> This is where the " magic " truly happens . Using zipForms ( or whatever form solution you prefer ) with DocuSign Ink , you can turn signing the listing agreement into a fun , memorable experience . The novelty of using their finger to sign the listing agreement on your iPad makes your clients feel that they are not signing their life away , but instead signing up for a great experience with you ! <p> Once the agreement is signed , you can export it as a PDF to Evernote from DocuSign Ink and--say it with me--save it to the client 's notebook . The best part ? You can then share the entire notebook with your client so that they 'll have everything : the listing agreement , net sheet , marketing plan , and more ! <h> Disclaimer <p> This blog is provided by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide visitors with information about real estate and related topics . <p> the site or its content . <p> MIAMI reserves the right to edit , remove or deny access to individuals or content that it determines to be unacceptable , including , but not limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anonymous comments . <h> About Us 9436 @qwx629436

@@77877552 @6577552/ <h> A/B Testing : We Share Some of Our Most Frequently Asked Questions <p> As I work to educate customers about how effective split testing can be for improving conversion rates and lead generation , I find myself answering very common questions . In this blog post , I 'll share these questions along with my answers . <p> What is , for you , the basis of conversion optimization ? I do n't really care for the term conversion optimization . ' I prefer the term Marketing Optimization . ' It 's a better descriptor as to what we are trying to achieve . For me , I really do n't care what a person 's goal is when they come to a site , I just want to ensure that whatever that goal happens to be , they are able to achieve it before they leave . Their goal could be to fill out a form , check pricing , purchase something or to share a photo of their favorite product with a friend . With a practice like split testing , we can optimize for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the basis of marketing optimization , to understand all the important macro and micro-conversions of a site , and use split testing to improve everything . <p> What have been the biggest changes on conversion optimization over the last three years ? The testing platforms have evolved and become much more sophisticated . We can now better segment our test results and even create specific audiences conditions for our tests . We can test one value proposition message to a visitor from New York , and a completely different one for visitors in California . This allows us to better understand visitor intent/behaviour and to fine-tune our marketing messages and ultimately improve business value . <p> What is , at the moment , the biggest challenge in the field of conversion optimization ? What I 'm starting to see out there is that a lot of people are calling themselves experts ' when it comes to onsite optimization . Running a deep and broad A/B testing program requires a lot of people working together to formulate a proper testing roadmap and then to execute on that roadmap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing that happened in the SEO world many years ago " so many people considered themselves SEO experts , but very few of them really had the depth of knowledge to do it properly . It 's crazy that there are still people out there trying to trick the search engines . It 's such a short term strategy . <p> There are a lot of tools to use for conversion optimization , such as A/B testing tools , heatmaps , and scrollmaps . For you , what are the most important tools besides Google Analytics in regards to conversion optimization ? <p> I think it is important to divide out these tools into two basic categories ; quantitative tools and qualitative tools . Quantitative tools like heatmaps and google analytics answer the What ' . What are people doing or what are people clicking on ? They are important tools , but not very useful by themselves . For example , we can use Google Analytics to measure the bounce rate of a page , but knowing bounce rate does n't provide any information about how to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , help answer the why . ' Why is someone clicking on this link or why are they making choice A over Choice B ? By using both quantitative and qualitative tools , you 'll start to get a much better picture of where all the friction points are on your site . That being said , my two favorite qualitative tools at the moment are Qualaroo and www.usertesting.com . I do n't have any affiliation with these tools , I just use them on a regular basis and like them . Qualaroo allows me to run exit surveys on a site . When I set up an exit survey , I ask three simple questions : <p> What is the purpose of your visit today ? <p> Where you able to complete the goal of your visit ? <p> If not ? Why ? <p> I think you can see how getting answers to the above questions can be a rich source of actionable insight . I also like running user testing using a tool like usertesting.com . This allows me to define a few very specific tasks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then get videos with audio that I can study to better understand what to improve . <p> Through A/B testing you can test emails and webpages . What are you testing further with A/B testing ? <p> I think it 's important to realize that creating a testing culture should go beyond the specific platform . When this is done , anything can be split tested , from your direct mail pieces to email subject lines to your PPC landing pages . In fact , the concept of split testing was first done with direct mail many years before the Internet became available . <p> Are you entirely data-driven when we talk about conversion optimization ? <p> You might be surprised to hear this , but no , I 'm not 100% data-driven . I do feel like intuition can play an important role in conversion optimization , as long as those intuitive ideas are rigorously tested . Numbers and metrics can sometimes fool you " you have to be careful about relying 100% on metrics . That is why I mentioned using more qualitative sources of data , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your web analytics program . As human beings , we tend to see correlations in the numbers that are n't always there . Take a look at the below link for a humorous example of how correlation does not imply causation ! <p> A lot of websites do n't have a traffic problem , but a conversion problem . Yes or no ? A lot of websites have a traffic problem AND a conversion problem . Many sites spend gobs of money driving large amounts of traffic that are n't relevant to the company 's value proposition . A low-traffic website can still make millions of dollars as long as the visitors coming in are highly focused . Of course , with a typical ecommerce conversion rate of 2-3% , there are always opportunities for improving onsite optimization . <p> Has the execution of A/B testing become increasingly important ? Yes . As tests become more sophisticated , it now can take a team of front-end developers , programmers , marketers and data scientists to truly create a strong testing program . While test execution is extremely important , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gathering data and understanding the site 's potential improvement areas . <p> Is the use of A/B testing tools &amp; heatmaps nowadays a must ? <p> Yes . Otherwise , you are just guessing at what to improve , and will have no quantitative basis to see which of your ideas are truly providing incremental business value . <p> Which two online marketing items are on your agenda for next year ? Continuing to speak and educate companies about the power and importance of allocating some of their marketing budget to online optimization efforts and to continue helping companies learn the art and science of split testing . It 's a smart and repeatable process that I 've seen work time and again across every industry and market type .
