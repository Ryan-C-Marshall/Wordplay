A man , standing on an A frame ladder , painting a ceiling of an outdoor entrance cover had finished the section he was working on . Instead of stepping down to move the ladder , he stepped up and put one foot over to the other side of the ladder , straddling the A. Then he quickly but methodically walked the ladder to a new location , like a man walking sideways on connected stilts . He then stepped back over to one side of the ladder and resumed painting . I have no idea how many codes that would have broken in The Bubble Wrapped West but I 'm certain workers compensation would have issues with this process . That said , from my perspective it was an effective way to move . <p> And that 's exactly what teachers are trying to do at this time of year . They look at their past years and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easier , and meaningful ? They are hungry for different , more effective approaches to things . Recently I 've had a few people contact me , looking for resources regarding student leadership . I wrote my Masters in Educational Leadership final paper on the topic of developing an effective student leadership program and created a rather large appendix of resources to share , ( I link to this later in the post ) . Today I took some resources I only had stashed away online due to a computer crash and put a number of them on the document sharing site Scribd , so that I can share them easily with anyone interested . This got me to open up my Masters Paper again and I came across the actual ladder that this post is really about . <p> I really like this Ladder of Student Involvement , and the focus it has on " Degrees of Participation " . True participation is based on shared leadership and empowering students . There are real parallels here to what we are seeing today with meaningful technology integration . ( Ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned and then working with their teacher to determine ways to demonstrate and assess the learning . <p> At both the classroom and the school levels , how much do we empower students and how much do we limit their participation in their own learning ? <p> This got me thinking about our adult leaders in a school . How much of our leadership do we really share ? Am I helping my staff climb the ladder of participation or am I doing a " ladder walk " moving us along where I think we should all go ? What things should I just decide , doing the whole staff a favour , and what things should go through a slower , but far more powerful , shared decision-making process ? <p> The reality is that there is no simple answer to these questions and I think that the staff at two different schools would need to be worked with in different ways . Switch the word Adult on the participation ladder to Administrator and the word Student to Teacher . How truly empowered are our staff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining factor to how truly empowered are our students ? The answers to these questions significantly influence our school culture and our school community . <p> " Good leadership consists of motivating people to their <p> highest levels by offering them opportunities , not obligations . " <p> John Heider , The Tao of Leadership <p> So now I 'll head back to the idea that this time of year teachers ( and administrators ) are looking for new and different ways of doing things . I 've had the privilege of joining a group of Connected Principals and learning from them . One of the most impressive things about this group so far has been their willingness to share ideas and to learn from one another . There is an exchange of ideas , and stories , that we all gain from . It is in that spirit that I share the following resources . <p> First I 'll share my masters paper , Developing an Effective Middle School Leadership Program , downloadable from Slideshare or Scribd . The appendix is designed to be a resource for others so skip the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the appendix on page 54 , and you 'll have access to many resources . Two more resources , both on Scribd , are a collection of Leadership Lesson Plans and a collection of stories or rather Metaphors to Learn By . <p> Its a subject of a whole other post , but I strongly believe that storytelling is a powerful and underused tool in teaching and learning , as well as in inspiring a common vision . That 's why I started this post with a story . A short story of a man doing something simple in a way Ive never seen it done before . From my cultural context it was n't something I would have thought of doing , but his ladder walk was an effective approach to completing the mans task . I hope that my resources can help others find different , hopefully better , approaches to their student leadership programs and I look forward to the new approaches in many areas of leadership that the Connected Principals will lead me to . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 3 Comments <p> David , thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this graphic and shared it with my staff today . What a powerful reminder that we need to give our students more ownership in their learning experiences ! <p> Dave great post . I like how the ladder construct maps well to a team of employees . I think I will reflect on that in my context and see how I might use it as a gage in how well I 'm doing as a leader with my team . <p> Recently my two managers and I took time to retreat and develop a set of shared goals . We came up with six but our #1 goal is notable . Goal 1 : Culture " Create a new culture within the Information Services Department " where IS staff enjoy coming to work , communicate freely with one another , feel supported and work to support and help one another , see the importance of the work they do for each other , schools , and the District , and collaborate with each other . <p> Your ladder construct may serve us in working through some of our strategies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your comments , I must admit with a bit of embarrassment that I have not shown this ladder to my own staff . Yet now does n't  seem the time . We are dealing with some issues in our new building that pose challenges beyond our control , ( cafeteria size , limited use of outdoor facilities and still waiting for a gym to name a few ) . Weve strategized and worked together to come up with some acceptable ( yet temporary ) solutions but ultimately we are in limbo until we can find out more ( still ) unknown information . It is difficult to talk about empowerment to a group of teachers that are feeling un-empowered . I know changes are coming that will improve things , but I have not been given concrete dates for anything , and am thus feeling un-empowered myself . How do you talk to teachers about shared decision-making when they are n't  in a frame of mind where they feel they can share in legitimate decision-making ? A situation like this really makes me wonder about how un-empowered students must feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are not truly given any power to make things happen .

All members of our school community should be given opportunities to become leaders . - This includes students , staff , and parents . <p> 7 . Parents are our partners in education . We must ensure that their voice is heard and that they are given opportunities to contribute to creating the best environment for our students . <p> 8 . Critical thinking and deep learning opportunities for our students are necessary to ensure that they become strong 21st century citizens . - We must know the passions of our students and create learning opportunities based on these. - Students need to be able to think , write , and create as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . We must ensure that we also create professional development opportunities for our staff to learn alongside our students and provide them ways to further their own knowledge in a deep , purposeful , and relevant way . <p> 9 . Technology should be used to create opportunities for students to ensure that we are meeting their needs and creating opportunities to network and learn from others . It is- necessary to ensure that students become strong 21st century citizens with a broad worldview . We need to include the world in our teaching , learning and thinking. - As educators , we must also take opportunities to use social media to connect with educators around the world that have different perspectives and experiences. - The more we connect , the more we learn . <p> 10 .

" How many of you can tell me who flew the first plane ? " Heads turned eyebrows raised whispers ceased ( so far I 'm making progress ) . " The Wright brothers did that , " someone said .

" Replies and jokes about that idea filled the room . ( People are still there in the meeting , no sidebar conversation , hang in there sell this ! ! ) " Would you agree that people who fly planes are pilots ? " We were agreed . Now for the big connection <p> " Teaching is like flying a plane . Nobody will say that the Wright brothers were not important and not one person will say they were not pilots but times have changed . Flight has evolved and is still evolving . The pilot of the Wright brothers era will not be able to fly todays jet . It does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed and now , to be a pilot , a person must be able to navigate the most current planes and jets .

But without change and advancement they are simply unable to do the job . " More folks are getting the connection.I think I have consumed an entire Starbucks venti iced tea in the past three minutes . <p> " YOU are pilots -some of you were trained in the most modern jets and other were trained in less modern planes but you all know how to fly and what the purpose of flying is.to move people from one place to another .

No movement . Thenall of a sudden people started to get it ! They wanted to fly better.they wanted to fly the big jet ! People started making plans to collaborate and . wait for it.POST online !

I really enjoyed your posting and like many in your audience i began to buy in as I continued to read on.what an excellent analogy with using the Wright brothers and pilots to motivate , support and itiate stimulating thinking amongst any group of educatorswell done . <p> Thanks Antonio ! We still are trying to get all of our folks on board , but I think the analogy allows us to have a common frame of reference about the ever-changing world of education that we all understand ! Tell me about your school ! <p> Tracey , Thank you for your response . Our Catholic school community involves just under 1000 students and about 80 staff members . Our school is at the beginning stages of under going a large scale renovation adding 23 new classrooms and making various changes to our exsisting building ( which is only 10 years old ) . Overall the staff is excited and also nervous regarding the construction and changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well despite the construction all around usa great example of working with our community and parish was our parking situation . The church is located nearby and allowed us to share their parking lot until our was completed . Staff were required to use a sticker on their cars for identification in the lot and this small change lead to many interesting discusssions . How does your school and staff deal with change ? Antonio <p> I linked through to this site and am so happy to read these important Guiding Principles . A brief introduction : I am a former high-tech worker ( outsourced many years ago ) and just received my CA English credential . While seeking a full-time job , I decided to create a site that my friend can use . She is an elementary school principal , who , while I was " living " on the computer for the past 15 years , was running her school . Her school just became " distinguished ! " While my friend achieved this remarkable milestone , its no wonder she is a little out of touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infancy of the social media revolution today is that computers are much easier to use than when I was struggling to create documentation about COBOL with a line editor . Now , there are content management systems , like this blog , where content prevails . No more computer crashing or wrangling with Word to get the message out . <p> In that light , I have spent my own time ( until I find a job hopefully next September ) creating a free program for administrators . In the spirit of Web 2.0 social networking , the program is called " schoodl . " It allows educators to have their own websites that are networked together . So , my friends school in Fremont will be a schoodl , and my other friends school in Vallejo will be a schoodl . Your schoodl can link to your district site , class websites , calendars , announcements , etc . <p> Please go to the site , take a look , and I will be more than happy to help you get your schoodl going . You can set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow it over time . There are simple training steps to follow to get your schoodl up . A little investment in learning how to use a content management system will pay off in the long run I promise ! <p> For the past 18 months , I have been building learning capacity for all things connected to my professional catch phrase of " 21st Century Learning . " Having created multiple electronic folders that include hundreds of websites and blogs , I finally came across Connected Principals . . . from which link I do not remember ! <p> When I read through the Guiding Principles , it was the table of contents out of my own professional philosophy as a school leader . I look forward to further exploring the website and am very interested in becoming an author and contributor . How does that happen ? <p> What a great presentation ! I 'm going to imnpemelt several of your ideas . I need to do an overhaul on many areas of my house . I have lots of cabinet space , but have not taken advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant believe I missed the online session yesterday . Are you going to do another one ? <p> ERP Software is designed to automate all the internal and external processes of an institution and also help in improving communication among Parents , Students , Teachers , Management , and Alumni . This product serves the purpose for school erp and college erp individually . <p> Just read Dave Meisters post about Core Values and the guiding principles above . A few thoughts : I think that the " kids first " meme , as well as such statements as " It is imperative we value the gifts , contributions and uniqueness of each individual , whether student , staff , or parent . " , while seemingly powerful and righteous on the surface , are problematic . I believe that we need to consider steering clear of sloganeering . Statements like " kids first " has the unintended consequence of breeding a kind of superficial evangelism that , by its very nature , is not entirely honest . And teachers who are compelled to preach such an evangel can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as human beings advocating for our own lives , comes first . It is thus honest to state that the kids do n't  come first . The teachers come first because in order to treat kids with the loving kindness that successful teaching demands , teachers must know , to their CORE , that they are valued and respected and honored.This then brings me to the issues of core values and pedagogy . Each educator comes to the classroom , and hence to her/his students , from an entirely unique place . Each has a unique sense of what constitutes teaching praxis , or the fusion of philosophy and action . here 's the dilemma for administrators : for myriad educators , a working philosophy , and the actions that logically follow , are not formed from conscious reflection . While teachers are often compelled by educational leaders to distill a working educational philosophy , they are rarely asked to challenge their assumptions about life , the universe and everything . The majority of educators lack self-awareness . They have little or no understanding of why they think and believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students a hierarchy of core values that , like the " kids first " meme , are not entirely honest . If we accept as true that it is the moment-to-moment interactions between adult and student that form the foundation for learning , than challenging our teachers to examine , deeply and honestly , their core values becomes an institutional imperative . One quick example , and then I 'll be quiet : what if , upon deep examination , a teacher comes to the conclusion that one of her fundamental core values ( even if it kind of makes her sad that this is so ) is to become wealthy ? Can she honestly share this with her students ? Can she " teach " from a place that acknowledges this foundational truth , or must she " pretend " that this is not the case ( for myriad an obvious reasons ) ? <p> I have enjoyed reading the posts on this site , especially as a first year principal hungry for new information and professional networking . I have been looking for a site to post some occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own blog , I was hoping this might be a good forum to post my reflections and share my new learnings . How does one post to this site or become a contributor ? <p> In reference to Educational leadership , I value this being the number one focus ; student needs . If we can not recognize that our students live in a world different than the one we grew up in , then we are never going to grab their attention , or teach them 21st Century Skills . Technology drives everything we do and too often it is left out for lack of funding , fear of change , or just being stuck in old habits . If we keep that first statement about student needs in mind at all times we cant do anything but move forward . 
@@58740253 @7740253/ <h> The Art and Science of Teaching <p> I 've always been a good athlete . Playing almost any sport , except the ones where I had to be really tall or strong , came pretty easily to me . In high school , I picked up tennis to rehab a soccer injury , and before I knew it , I was the best player on my team . I was so proud when the coach made me the #1 singles player . And then I started losingto everyone . I found a coach who agreed to hit with me to help me understand my strengths and weaknesses . On our first day together , I hit all my best shots to show him my tennis skills . When I strutted up to the net , I expected to hear how good I was , and instead he told me , nicely , respectfully , and honestly , that I did n't know how to do anything . I 'd never had a tennis lesson before . So I was using every inch of athleticism I possessed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start at the beginning . He asked me if I wanted to learn how to play tennis , and if I wanted to understand the game . When I agreed to let him teach me , we did n't start by tracking down difficult shots in the corner , or serving as hard as I could . Instead , he started at the beginning , by teaching me how to hold a racket correctly . <p> I had a similar experience when I began teaching . At the time , I thought of teaching as only an art . I ca n't play the piano or the guitar , but as a young teacher , I thrived in front of the kids . I felt like I could connect with the toughest students ; pull inferences and understanding out of a hat , and lead disadvantaged students to the learning I wanted for them . I was an artist , with the classroom as my palate , and the students as the canvas . Then my mentor , over time , nicely , respectfully , and honestly , taught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . She helped me to practice the purposeful shift away from students memorizing what I told them , to students constructing and making their own meaning from the ideas we explored together . My mentor helped me to purposefully practice my teaching , just as my tennis coach had years before . Purposeful practice of specific instructional strategies was my introduction to the science of teaching . <p> In my administrative graduate program , Elliot Eisner asked us whether or not teaching was an art or a science . Are all good teachers born to it , or can good instructional practices be learned , practiced , and improved upon ? I do believe in an IT factor ; a quality that some great teachers have . Those of us who spend lots of time visiting classrooms know that every once in a while we stumble into a room where the teaching and learning is beautiful and it feels like art in the making . But we also know that a school year is a marathon , and plenty of days throughout a school year fall far short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT can connect with angry , shy , brilliant , and struggling students . But IT is n't enough to move student learning forward daily . But IT alone is n't enough to move student learning forward , daily . <p> I believe good instruction is also a science . I know in urban schools , we give far more credence to the art of teaching than the science . We act like only those teachers with the IT factor can survive in urban communities . But the truth is , it 's the science of teaching that ensures whether or not all students learn . Each year , we hire close to twenty-five first year teachers on our campus of high schools . Many enter our schools like I entered the tennis court in high school or my first classroom , full of confidence . These new teachers are gifted entertainers , talkers , readers , or writers . But they do n't know how to teach , yet . <p> I 've learned that new teachers , who are willing , start with practicing the instructional equivalent of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become some of our best . Those that believe the IT factor is all they need , either leave on their own , or ultimately we invite them to leave because they ca n't meet our diverse learners ' needs . <p> I 've spent more time recently thinking about the convergence of the art and science of teaching because my son is learning to swim . Every Saturday , we attend a thirty-minute lesson . His teacher is amazing . Watching her work with my son and the other beginner swimmers has me thinking about what I do and do not see in the classrooms I visit back at school . <p> Here 's some of what she does : <p> She gets the students excited about both swimming in general and the specific activity ahead <p> She acknowledges whatever fear the students bring to the pool , but she does n't let anyone focus on that fear <p> She has a clear idea of the skills she wants students to practice in each lesson <p> Every lesson is a balance between something the students can already do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever finished being learned , everything is practiced and refined , and improved upon <p> There are multiple activities in each lesson , but they are all different ways to practice the same skill <p> She encourages , laughs , commends , and challenges the students each and every class <p> She makes time to instruct the whole group , but understands individual strengths and weaknesses <p> She pushes , and never accepts when a student says they ca n't do it <p> Every student has the opportunity be successful ; and how they accomplish the learning is a little different for each swimmer <p> At some point in our training most of us take an educational psychology course and study Lev Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development ( ZPD ) . - Each Saturday , I watch my son 's teacher find his zone . He is nervous at the beginning of every class and so proud at the end of the lesson . His teacher pushes him , meaningfully and purposefully , and I 'm watching him learn to swim . His teacher has found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She absolutely has the IT factor . My son talks about her all week long , and watching her instruction is like watching art in the making . But more importantly , she understands her content and is developing purposeful lessons to push the whole group and each individual student . <p> I see well-developed lessons regularly . But I do n't regularly see lessons that ensure all students are in their ZPD . Do you ? Are you having conversations with teachers and colleagues about how to develop lessons to purposefully push student learning forward ? <p> I 've written before about the hidden contract of urban schools when teachers , students and administrators agree not to push at each other . Watching my son 's swim lessons is a stark reminder for me of how often the school day just happens to our students . Despite our best intentions , students can experience a period , a day , or a week where real learning does n't happen . Without a doubt , they are exposed to new ideas regularly , but we have to be far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the outcome . Attending class and completing seat time towards finishing the day , the week , or the course is not learning . Why does it seem easier to set up meaningful learning experiences for students in the pool , on the tennis court , or on the baseball field , but with those same students , it 's a struggle to set up purposeful and dynamic learning in English , chemistry and history class ? <p> Are you having this conversation at your school ? Do you emphasize the art or science of teaching in your community ? Is learning about finding each student 's zone of proximal development in your school community ? Are teacher teams designing learning opportunities for students in the way coaches help students improve their practice on the athletic field ? <p> The fast pace and relative chaos of each day and the entire year in an urban environment contributes to our efforts to hire teachers who understand the art of teaching , and hope they pick up the science on their own . But growing a good school has to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your school make this commitment to teachers ?

What I made sure they knew was that if I walked into the classroom and the schedule said " math " that I would n't be upset if they were deep into a social studies- project . - I trusted that they would do what they needed and take the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and themselves . <p> I have talked about Ann Michaelsen and her school before and how they teach English for an entire day , math another day , science another day , etc. , instead of teaching each subject a certain amount of time for each day , five times a week . - This goes back to the idea of " innovating inside of the box " ; how do we really push the limits of learning while still ensuring that we are meeting the requirements of the " job ? " <p> The space does n't  really mean that much if you do not have the time to explore , and if I had to pick , time is more important . - Together though , the " space " and " time " are needed to really go deep . - Let 's make sure that is remembered in our focus on innovative learning environments . <p> I know that a successful workshop day for me is when we have used the entire day and are past time , and nobody seems to notice . Wouldnt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Related <h> 2 Comments <p> Thank you for the post ! A quick reply from the Netherlands . The central idea of this post is about creating the most effective learning space . That means making choices , and those choices depends on a multitude of factors . But I think its important to start with identifying and analyzing the learning proces first . When students need to learn some simple basic facts , I 'm not so sure if its really effective to teach one subject this day , another subject the next day . We all know the rules about cognitive load , and the importance of and spaced repetition . But when the content matter becomes more complex and the learning process is more about relational levels of understanding ( applying , synthesis , justify , evaluation , etc. ) we need a learning space that supports this process , in time and support . We also need to look at the characteristics of the learners . Some students are helped with lots of time , others are certainly not ! So I think the question of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we need in education is flexibility , in space and time , based on pedagogical choices informed by the characteristics of the complexity of the content matter , specific learning process and the needs of the learners . <p> I spent 48 of my 50 years at the elementary level as a teacher and school leader.Two of those years were spent as a school leader in middle school where I observed teachers trying to engage their students within 43 minutes periods . Oh , how I missed the " luxury " of extending a writing period to 2 hours , or using an entire afternoon for a science lab or a social studies project ! ! Many secondary schools are now using longer blocks of times which gives teachers a new challenge , but also more time to be creative . Thanks for the articleIll share it !

To be honest when I hear the word reflection the image that comes to my mind is that of looking in a mirror and seeing my own reflection . Yes there are other definitions for the word ( one of them being careful thought , especially the process of reconsidering previous actions ) . But for me I still have that image of the mirror . - Therefore at this time of year do I want to see look at see who I am now who is that person in the mirror or do I want to see how far that person has grown .

@@58740292 @7740292/ <h> How Can We Support Mental Health and Well-Being in Schools ? <h> The Good News <p> This summer I spent a lot of time with my cousin who wrote a six-part blog series about collective impact that I followed in August . It got me thinking about how this type of intentional work within schools and within our broader school communities could better support students . <p> Promoting well-being is a focus in Ontario schools . It includes supporting the whole child : cognitive , emotional , social , and physical well-being . The most challenging area is mental health . <p> We have access to more experts and resources than in the history of schooling . We have processes in place to support students in crisis and ongoing training for all staff . There is a lot to celebrate . But I think everyone would agree that there is still more work to do . Our kids still need more . <p> Many adults in a school may be working independently or as a team to support one child . Each person has a different role to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people : <p> But- despite all the agencies , - expert support , and caring- parents , kids are still in distress and there is sometimes a feeling of helplessness in schools when trying to- support students who struggle with mental health issues . <h> My Big Question <p> We all want the same thing : healthy whole-hearted children and youth . <p> I wonder if were making an impact . I wonder if were missing something . I wonder if there is more we can do . I wonder if were trying to do too much too fast . I wonder if we are being intentional enough about the way we are working alone and together . I wonder why sometimes even when a student has access to every support , s/he still suffers every day . These are the kinds of thoughts that keep me up at night . <p> Is it that more students are struggling or that were getting better at noticing ? According to an in-depth CBC feature- anxiety disorders affect six percent of children and youth . Twenty-two percent of children will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school staff rooms and on social media is that it feels like more students struggle with anxiety now than in the past and the cases seem much more complex . So it might be- both : more students are struggling and more educators are noticing just how complex mental health issues can be . <p> So my big question is how can we use a collective impact model to support student well-being ? - <h> Autonomy AND- Collaboration ? <p> This- is too big a problem to solve alone . Supporting student well-being is a job for the whole village . <p> What is my role ? - I am- one person in the village with a specific skill set and knowledge base . We need to better understand the roles of each individual in our village and be clear about what collaboration can look like . <p> A couple years ago at a high school we tried looking at this with our Student Success Team . On our team were vice principals , guidance counsellors , special education teachers , coop teachers , attendance counsellor , school board counsellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met weekly to discuss students who were struggling with academic and socio-emotional issues . Classroom teachers referred names to our team , we collected information , looked for trends , brainstormed supports , and followed-up with the student who needed support . I understood my role as a vice principal but I wanted to know more about the other roles . I wondered if there was overlap or gaps in service . <p> We created a google-doc and sat around the conference table with our laptops . The headings were something like : <p> Name : Jessica <p> Role : VP <p> Goal : what is the purpose of your job ? <p> Meetings : what information do you require at a Student Success Meeting to do your job ? <p> Strategies : what strategies do you use to support students ? <p> Students : which students do you serve ? <p> Successes : what works well ? <p> Challenges : what is most challenging ? <p> We went round-robin and filled in the chart with as much detail as possible . Then I synthesized the trends and patterns into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps : - Reflecting on Student Success Meetings . <p> This thinking was a good start for our team in being more intentional . Where we fell short was on taking the time to really develop a solid plan from here . We had some great ideas and implemented some changes , but we did n't  have metrics . We needed to return to these questions and better monitor our work along the way . We needed to measure what impact our changes made . The second year would have been crucial in consolidating this thinking/learning and maybe the team continued to refine their collective work but I moved to another school . <h> Collective Impact as a Possible Solution <p> If supporting students with mental health issues in schools is something I cant do on my own , then how will we work together ? How will we ensure efficient service delivery ? How can we prevent students from falling through gaps in service ? <p> We rely on the strength of- home , school , and community partnerships . We rely on the expertise of othersI think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We like to be in control and to support students well we have to acknowledge our limits in schools and trust our community partners . We have to learn what success looks like and even though our hearts cry out that it looks like happiness for all , that may not be realistic . We live in a complex world with complex problems . <p> The first step is to develop a clear vision and ensure a common understanding . We need to put all our questions out there even if they fly back at us like boomerangs without answers . <p> Ontario has a comprehensive strategy called Open Minds , Healthy Minds- that includes building resilience through schools . Our board has an amazing leadership team supporting schools . I am blessed to work with a dedicated school staff . This collective work has already started and I feel confident that we will all get better at supporting students in time . We need to persevere . <p> In my humble opinion here are some other things I think we need to start doing together : <p> Teach parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health issues the way parents have learned to advocate for special education needs . We need to help parents navigate the systems . I want to learn more about what parents need . <p> Prioritize meetings with school teams , board teams , community teams , provincial teams , national teams , and/or global teams to strategize how to work together with more intention , to learn from each other , and to check for gaps or overlaps in services . ( Perhaps we need collective impact consultants like my cousin to bring teams together . An outside facilitator can help us stretch our thinking , - build trusting relationships , and bring more purpose to our work ) . <p> Communicate better- what everyone is doing to support mental health issues in children and youthand in a simple , efficient way . ( Some days I feel I do n't  have enough information and others I 'm on information overload ) . <p> Leverage technology to build online learning communities that include stakeholders learning together and problem-solving from various perspectives . I know these must exist but the people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . I would love a safe , confidential forum to discuss student well-being- with other school leaders and experts as need arises . <p> Plan for how to support students in moments of crisis at school and- to support students with- ongoing mental health issues . ( I am learning how to support students in moments of crisis , but I am unclear of my role as an educator when a student demonstrates a mental health issue over timefrom months to years . ) <p> Learn how to better cope or where to go next when nothing changes when interventions are utilized. - How do we know when we 've done enough ? As one doctor told me , mental health issues can be fatal . I struggle with accepting that . I struggle with knowing what to do when a student is receiving treatment but we are not seeing changes at school and years passthis is why we sometimes feel helpless . We want our support to lead to change and sometimes it does n't  . <p> I 'm optimistic that in my lifetime we will continue to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators will feel more confident in the role they can play in supporting student well-being . I 'm optimistic that if we are more intentional within our schools and communities good things will come . We will reach another tipping point . <p> Questions are good . Let 's start there . And my question remains : how can we use a collective impact model to support student well-being ? <p> The answer lies in our collective commitment to action . Commitment is a promise to do or to give something . Are you committed or just interested ? We need people who are going " to do or to give " sitting at the table . What are you willing and able- to do or to give ? We each have a role in this village .

Become more accountable by using the right kind of data : - Scrutiny by our parent " consumers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educators who might wish that parents not approach school choices as consumers are only going to be disappointed . - We live in an age of information availability and data-driven decision-making . <p> I believe that our role and responsibility as educational leaders , to remain relevant in the coming educational transformation , is not to refuse data/accountability , but to choose and use the right and best data for the right and best accountability . - Standardized testing will have to be a part of it , but we can use better testing than what is mostly used today , like the- MAP and- CWRA . <p> We can also use school climate/student engagement surveys and alumni tracking to provide data broader than testing , and we can and should publish our student work in dynamic and attractive digital portfolios ( such as these at High Tech High ) for the most authentic and best kind of - accountability : our student work . <p> And perhaps it goes without saying , but let 's say it : none of the following techniques will offer value if we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways we carefully choose to measure , share , and demonstrate them . <p> 2 . Ensure safe , welcoming , connected and caring school communities . - - Schools could be warehouses and factories for children who could become lost in a crowd only when they were monopolies in their communities , but tomorrow , students who do n't  feel safe at their schools or connected to their school community wont come they will choose another option or they will stay home and connect on-line . - I like Vander Arks recognition , borrowing from Dan Pink ( what he called in- A Whole New Mind the significance of " high concept/high touch " ) that successful schools in the coming years will be " Blended- **26;57;TOOLONG models .

Students see the world all around them , and they see it is a world where every professional employs digital tools such as laptops and mobile devices in their everyday work . - Surely it must be frustrating to students to come to preparatory school , schools intending to prepare them for entry into the professional world , and be disallowed these very same tools . - When workplace tools were pencils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools of school ; computers should be as much a part of students learning today and tomorrow as pencils and papers were yesterday . - Students should use digital tools on tests and on projects in the school setting as much as they will be required to do so in their work setting , if we are to prepare them effectively .

Nothing is more important for the future of our society , Tom Friedman and President Obama agree , than that our youth become innovators , able to problem solve the way out of our societal challenges with creativity and ingenuity . - But how do we educate innovators ? - Steven Johnson , author of- Where Good Ideas Come From , and- Chris Anderson , curator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social aspects of innovative culture , and so we can see that the innovative mindsets will best be cultivated by ensuring our students can be digitally networked . - Networked , we stimulate each other , inform each other , motivate each other ; we discover what 's new and we add to it , challenging someone else to do the same . <p> Watching youtube and posting video to facebook so that our peers can be informed and inspired and challenged to keep up and advance the creative instinct is what will empower our youth today to be tomorrows innovators . - Stifling and squashing the primary way information is exchanged among people under forty is not the way to keep education relevant and effective : open the networks . <p> 7 . Employ video : Chris Anderson , of TED , - says that watching video takes us back to storytelling around the campfire , where the storyteller is backlit with a flickering flame . - It is ingrained in our genes to appreciate it . - By video , our students can learn from the very best minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , Khan Academy , or the very swiftly increasing number of other such sites . <p> By watching video students can learn far more at home during homework than they every could by reading a textbook , and indeed , if they can watch their teachers lectures on video at home they can come to school ready to confront and tackle difficult challenges . <p> But it is n't just watching video that will make learning relevant and effective ; it is by making video . - Our students must still learn to write and speak , but for learning to be effective in preparing for their future , they must learn to craft video . - Digital video communication must join writing and speaking as the trinity of communication essentials . - The concept of video communication can be expanded just a bit to include additional visual communication : data visualization is going to be a hugely important communication tool ( as in this video , 200 countries , 200 years , 4 minutes ) , and our students should be learning it in school . <p> 8. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love video games ; we know that the US military , some medical practices , and many corporations are using gaming to learn . - - If students love it and it is good enough for adults , why ca n't digital gaming have a role in our schools ? - I do n't  like gaming , and I am not suggesting we impose it on all , but as James Paul Gee , Marc Prensky , - Jane McGonigal , - Jesse Schell and the fine scholars at- Epistemic Games are effectively demonstrating , gaming can contribute to intellectual development . - The schools which best determine how to use gaming effectively will have a significant leg up in the coming competition for students both because their learning environments will be more learning , and I believe , more effective . <p> As Vander Ark writes , <p> The instant feedback from- content-embedded assessment , especially learning games , simulations , virtual environments , and MMOs ( massively multiplayer online games ) , will be widely used in formal and informal learning and will build persistence and time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplayer online ( MMO ) , will become part of every student's- extended day learning . <p> 9. - Provide Digitally Adaptive Skill Development . I do n't  want computers to replace teachers ; I swear I dont. - See number 2 above : our teachers must become more important rather than less in the way they connect with and care for students . - My argument is here is that if we are to compete with on-line academies that will lure our students away from us , we ought to integrate into our teachers classrooms the best tools available for student learning . - - Basic skill development is essential , and we can use digital tools to enhance their learning while a teacher serves as inspiration , coach , mentor , motivator and counselor at every step . - We can use computer adaptive testing to get much more immediate and much more detailed assessment of students learning needs and differentiate accordingly ; as Vander Ark writes , " Adaptive content will result in more time on task ( in some cases , two times the productive learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better targeted learning experiences will boost achievement . " <p> Note that while what we are familiar with in this way has been very much restricted to multiple choice and fill in the blank type tools , the new tools will allow far more authentic assessment , whereby students can received valuable feedback on constructed response tasks responding to real-world situated performance tasks - that feel meaningful and significant to students . <p> As- Blake-Pollock writes , " In ten years , the teacher who has n't  yet figured out how to use tech to personalize learning will be the teacher out of a job . " <p> 10 . Use On-Line , Open Source Textbooks . - Static , dead-tree textbooks are increasingly archaic already , and if we want student to learn in the form in which they will need to continue to learn throughout their lives , we should use the kind of on-line learning compendia that the new " textbooks " will offer . - The- OER , Open Educational Resources , Commons is coming and coming fast , and it can not come too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - What a resource for our educators to " curate " textbooks to suit their curricula , teaching styles , and students learning requirements , and what a way for our educators to take back the creative autonomy to design curriculum as professional rather than to defer the curriculum design to nameless faceless textbook " writers . " - Vander Ark is enthusiastic : " Soon a- state and a handful of urban districts will stop buying print textbooks in 2011 and will shift to customizable digital texts and- open education resources . " Blake-Pollock writes <p> Books were nice . In ten years time , all reading will be via digital means . And yes , I know , you like the feel of paper . Well , in ten years time you 'll hardly tell the difference as paper itself becomes digitized . <p> 11 . Support our Educators in Becoming Growth-Mindset , Networked , Online Learners and Creators . This last could and should be first : For our educators to be teachers in the digital age they should be learners in the digital age . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our teachers to network , collaborate , share and learn is infinite . - The notion of a teacher alone in a classroom of students , door close , left to his or her on devices , is a 20th century dinosaur ; todays teachers to teach the digital generation can and should seize the opportunity that educational nings , wikie , twitter groups , blogs , and all the other powerful collaborative tools of the Web 2.0 to be informed and inspired in their teaching journey . - As Blake-Pollock writes : - " With the power of a PLN in their backpockets , teachers will rise up to replace peripatetic professional development gurus as the source of schoolwide prof dev programs . " <p> Some , or perhaps many , schools will choose not to pursue these initiatives , and the good news for them is that in the breadth of diversity that the new age of education is permitting , some of those that choose to refuse will indeed survive , even flourish . - As the transformation occurs , their will be opportunities for schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , they might appeal to a significant enough minority to sustain themselves . <p> For the majority of schools , however , choosing to refuse this agenda is choosing to become obsolete : neither relevant to the educational options selectors ( both parents and students ) will select , - nor effective in preparing students for our information age transformed society . <p> I certainly understand the list you have assembled and see many of these same issue on college campuses . For your #5 and some others the idea of Individualized Computing is fast becoming a powerful force in teaching and learning that will challenge schools to respond just when our budgets are strained to the limit . <p> i think if you put them at a computer/laptop at home the work would be eseaier and that the students would try harder to susceed and pass more students.if you put them on a computer/laptop they could use the internet to understnad it better most of them will pass even better because they might have a problem with waiting for someone something like i do.try it see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in know it will help me

Even the notion of adding a new technology coach may have its drawbacks , especially is they are not given clear direction for their work . Coaching may be intended to be supportive but , depending on how it is implemented , it can create more work for all concerned . <p> The last thing that schools need is to put their teaching teams and teacher-leaders in a position where they genuinely feel overworked despite all good intentions from the schools leadership team to improve the school .

@@58740308 @7740308/ <h> Does class size really matter ? <p> Class size is frequently a topic for discussion by administrators and teachers . Even when we end up in a school that has lower class size averages compared to other schools , the class size issue does not always appear to go away ; we perhaps do not recognize it when conditions are good . <p> So , why is there such a debate over class size ? Firstly , student numbers in classes are perceived to be directly proportional to teacher workload . Secondly , it is claimed that when class sizes are too big teachers can not give the same individual attention and feedback to students than if there were smaller classes . Subsequently , there is the call for smaller class sizes because this would improve teaching and learning . <p> Logically speaking , this makes sense but if class sizes were lowered would there be a difference in student learning and achievement outcomes ? Not necessarily so , and here 's why . <p> John Hattie undertook a meta-analysis of factors that influence student achievement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible to rank the practices that have the biggest effect on student achievement . While his work has been criticized in some corners , we can still draw a lot from it and it is a great starting point for reflecting on what we need to do in our schools to improve student learning . <p> Having heard Hattie speak some years ago , he upset quite a few of my colleagues when he said that class size does not have much impact on student achievement . Of all the interventions that we could put in place to positively influence student achievement , class size had little impact when compared to other strategies . This is not what teachers wanted to hear at all . Unfortunately , policymakers also misinterpreted Hattie 's research to justify increases in class size or no reduction . <p> If all schools were to reduce class sizes tomorrow , while pleasing some teachers in terms of their perceived workload it could possibly have little impact on student learning for the following reasons : <p> When class sizes are lower , some teachers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large class sizes are not always effective with smaller groups . <p> When it comes to individual feedback , sure , smaller class sizes would help the teacher spend more time with each individual . This , however , relies on the assumption that with small class sizes , the teacher will give more time to feedback . Even then , how do we know if the feedback is actually going to be effective ? <p> Taking a closer examination of the contact hours teachers have with their classes as being more significant in improving student learning may actually be a better way to go than reducing class size . If teachers actually had less contact time / less classes then they can spend more time with collaborative work and professional learning that improves classroom practice . Obviously , this is difficult to do also , owing to the budgets given to schools for staffing . <p> In essence , if class sizes do not get reduced , there are plenty of ways we can improve , as teachers and schools , to work with the numbers . This post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without effective teaching it does not make much difference other than to personal workload in terms of marking and , possibly , teacher classroom management .

First , I think its interesting that all of the reasons listed that reducing class sizes has little impact on student achievement are based on the assumption that teachers stink anyway so if a teacher is going to stink , let them stink with 45 kids . Why reduce class sizes and assume the expense that goes with that change only to have bad teachers in classrooms with fewer kids ? <p> #ouch <p> And I think there 's a " chicken/egg " scenario going on here . Maybe ineffective teachers are ineffective BECAUSE their workload is ridiculous ? Maybe if teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce contact hours we could invest that time in developing better practice . <p> This stuff is all on my mind this year because for the first time in close to 15 years , I have classes that are under 30 students .

Typically I 'm up near 120-130 kids . <p> And I can tell you that Ive already invested FAR more time into planning and reflecting and revising my practice than I have in previous years mostly because the management workload is lighter . When I can grade papers and enter scores in less time , I 've got more time to turn around and think about the work that I 'm doing in my classroom . <p> I also find myself tinkering with my practice taking professional risks more often this year because I 'm taking those risks with smaller classes . Trying something new in a room of 22 is a lot different than trying something new in a room of 36 . <p> My push against arguments like " reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we REALLY want teachers to innovate and reflect and give feedback and change practice and collaborate , we would do BOTH of those things ! <p> Thanks for your thoughts on this Bill . I feel very much caught in a catch 22 situation . I get frustrated when some teachers use class size as an excuse not to change practice . Yet at the same time , I really feel for those who are making every effort to reflect on what they do and improve their practice . Which is why reducing class size for some teachers may make a significant difference . <p> I believe strongly that with most issues in education , if we can improve teacher practice we can address most of the problems to a certain extent . Though , I can not help thinking that our best teachers are being taken advantage of by policymakers and the fact that teaching is more than a job we make a difference to young people and they rely on us to support them . For this reasons , we should still fight the fight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think reducing teacher contact hours would be far more productive than reducing class size because of the support that can be given plus the collaboration that could take place such as peer observation . <p> I am fortunate to work in a school where class sizes are small in comparison to where you work . This is not always appreciated by some of those fortunate to work in the school who see problems as always Admins issue rather than reflecting on what they can personally do to make a difference . <p> Once again , thanks for giving this your thought and taking the time to contribute to the discussion . <p> As an English Department Chair at one of the highest performing schools in California I am deeply offended by Hattie so called research and Mr. Burtons article about class sizes essentially not meaning much . At the moment I have 172 students . My largest class is 41 ( Freshmen Honors ) and my smallest class i loaded at 32 . The work load has become so great recently that I basically have eliminated entire assignments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grading . I also have ceased making comments on student essays relying more on holistic rubric scores . I also have stopped calling all parents simply for an introduction . If fact so much of my time is absorbed in the clerical work and grading involved in maintaining that many students that I simply do n't  have time to do many of the strategies and interventions I used to do . This mind you is with me putting in over 50 hours a week in this job . Unfortunately I have seen a real decline in student work , achievement and an increase in the amount of students that fall through the cracks . I have personally seen this because when I began teaching 11 years ago we still had the 20 to 1 in a freshmen class . At that time my case load was in the low hundreds or sometimes even in the 90s . The amount of time I was able to spend with both students and parents was irreplaceable and nobody fell through the cracks unless they themselves jumped through one purposely . I find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , observe a few controlled classrooms and come up with a theory to sell a book . Most if not all of these researchers have never spent any significant time in public high schools dealing with what teachers who are in the trenches deal with on a day to day basis . This is the equivalent of the College Boy Officers sent to command men who have been on the front lines for months or even years . Their message simply does not ring true because there is no SUBSTANCE behind it . And please do n't  bore me as Hatties research does with references to " Figure 4.1 " and " Table A " Bottom line : none of this means anything when faced with the real challenge of teaching teenagers many of whom do not want to be there as they are exposed to a subject they care little about . In addition the idea of less contact time is " nice " but at the moment nothing more . Since I have no more room in my class to place any more seats ( I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of lecture halls and auditorium sized classrooms since the current ones would simply be too small . I do n't  think I need to tell you that this is incredibly unrealistic . When my father went to Stanford University for a doctorate in education he was placed with a team of 20 other grad students for the purpose of conducting " educational research " with the goal of publishing their findings . My father was the only one who had ever taught public school . In fact in his 47 years in public education , holding every position imaginable from teacher to superintendent , he has yet to encounter one of these so called education researchers who has spent any substantial time in a classroom as a public school educator . These are the people who are " leading " the charge towards " better " more " effective " public education . God help us when the West Point officer leads us straight into an ambush because she or he only knows theory and data , not what it is like to actually be in a combat situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great teachers who do a fabulous job with large class sizes . I do think reducing class sizes would make a difference to them . We need to support our best teachers to keep them in the professional and to ensure that they do not burn out . <p> What is most frustrating is where less effective teachers claim that they need smaller class sizes in order to be effective . That does not sit comfortably with me . I think this , perhaps , contributes , to why reducing class size does not have anywhere near the impact on improving compared to many of interventions that Hattie points out in his research . <p> Even more frustrating , I have worked both with large classes and small in my career , is when class sizes are small , some teachers do not make the most of it and they are complacent so disappointing . <p> Though , I do think I would rather are for less contact time for teachers as opposed to smaller class sizes because of the learning that could take place for us to become better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again , if we gave every teacher an extra two hours in a week , who would use it wisely and who would n't ? <p> I guess what I am really trying to say is that I want to do more for our great teachers . <p> I teach a portfolio-based project-based curriculum with students using computers . I 've often had one section with 38 students and another section of the same class with 29 . The larger class falls behind in curriculum . In the smaller class I 'm able to give more attention to individual students , and get to know their strengths and their needs . <p> That 's just my classes . What about the Chemistry lab class with 38 students ? How many of those young people never really learn to do the tasks , never get hands-on time , never get one-on-one attention from the teacher . ( If I 'm getting heated here its because the private school down the block has 10 students in a chemistry class . ) <p> I know I 'm one of the " good ones . " I 've never received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I spend with students in the classroom and do not want less contact time . When I was struggling as a first year teacher I found my mantra : " These are children and they want someone to care about them . " All I 'm saying is : Its easier to care about 27 at a time instead of 38 . <p> Thanks for contributing to the discussion . You raise some important considerations . <p> I think that reducing class size helps but it is not the panacea that some would claim . I agree , staying on track with curriculum is a challenge and reducing class size would allow students to get more hands on skills development in a chemistry lab . <p> Hatties work suggests that reducing class size is not as effective in improving student learning outcomes compared to a lot of other teaching strategies and interventions . This is the key . Teaching is complex and just by reducing class size there is no guarantee of instant improvement in learning . The quality of teaching and teachers is what make the biggest difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size is perhaps shown to have a bigger impact on learning when young children have greater contact time with teachers that care about them . <p> I have worked in public schools with classes in the low thirties and in private schools with classes in the low 20s and teens . It is amazing that the instructional quality between private and public schools does not differ that much in my opinion . You are , therefore , entitled to be frustrated and angry . Even more so , when you see that some teachers in private schools do not take advantage of the good conditions that they enjoy to improve their teaching and student learning . <p> First , the fact that you believe most teachers are inherently lazy because they do n't  necessarily appear to do more for students when class sizes are smaller is disrespectful of teachers in general . It perpetuates the view held by the general public that teachers are lazy and greedy . Teaching is one of the most disrespected and unappreciated professions in the US , despite the fact that it is a challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make a difference . <p> Teachers are already incredibly overworked as a rule . Perhaps a school that reduces class sizes adds to a teachers workload in other wayscommittees , clubs , coaching , mentoring , you name it . These additional duties are rarely mentioned in discussion about teacher workload . <p> If you do n't  see a teacher immediately change his teaching practice because this year he has smaller classes , perhaps its because he finally feels like the workload is more manageable . Maybe he was on the edge of burning out . Or perhaps its unreasonable to expect teachers to turn on a dime when a policy changes . Maybe he is reluctant to adjust his instructional methods because he does n't  trust that the district/school are committed to keeping small classes . The amount of mandates and policy changes that teachers deal with in a given school year is absurd , even more so given the fact that before a new policy has been fully implemented , its replaced and sometimes added on to with something else . Its difficult for teachers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic indecision . <p> Secondly , I hear you say research shows that reducing class size is n't as important to student achievement as other strategies . I wonder if you differentiate between achievement and learning as I notice you use them interchangeably . From my perspective as an educator in the classroom trenches , these are two separate concepts . <p> Achievement is based on quantifiable outcomes through testing . <p> Learning is an internal process of building understanding through engaging in meaningful activities . <p> As a former high-achieving student , I have direct experience with thisstraight As and high test scores did not mean I actually learned content . Those things represented how well I played the game of school . In fact , I can tell you very little about the classes I aced in high school and as an undergrad in college . It was n't until I was in graduate school , when I connected deeply with the content and the professors , that I finally saw the difference between achievement and learning . My relationship with my professors and their modeling of expectations that full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an authentic learner . <p> Being an authentic learner can and does lead to achievement , but achievement does not necessarily demonstrate authentic learning . <p> I am foremost concerned with student learning because that is ultimately what will serve students best in their lives . Achievement will happen when the focus is on learning , but it may not be identifiable on a standardized test or at a specific age . <p> And I am absolutely certain that class size matters when it comes to student learning . Case in point : I regularly ask my students for feedback . At the end of this most recent school year , when I had 35 students in a class versus the previous year , when I had 25 , a common thread in feedback from the kids was that they did n't  have enough access to me and that affected their learning . Imagine my disappointment . My job does n't  necessarily get easier with smaller class sizes , but I am able to impact student learning much more significantly , which is why I became a teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the impact of class size . <p> I would like to clarify a few things though . Firstly , at no point do I claim that teachers are lazy and perhaps this is your interpretation of the post . Please refer to the last paragraph where I do state that most teachers do work very hard . " <p> Secondly , the post does not dismiss reducing class size as not important but , perhaps , comparing it to other strategies for improving student learning and achievement it is not as effective . <p> You make a good point about learning and achievement . Hatties research clearly states achievement . I have , as you say , used the terms learning and achievement interchangeably , which may not be a good thing to do . <p> I apologize for putting words in your mouth . You did not SAY teachers were lazy . Let me clarify how I drew my conclusions quoting your words : <p> " student numbers in classes are perceived to be directly proportional to teacher workload " and " If all schools were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of their perceived workload " ( From my perspective , there is an undertone of criticism in these words especially in using the word perceived , implying that teachers main agenda is to reduce their workload , not to support student learning . ) <p> " This is not what teachers wanted to hear at all . " ( Again , an implication that teachers want class sizes reduced to make their lives easier and are not concerned with how class sizes affect student learning . ) <p> " If professional practice is poor " ( This is the first reason you list for why class size reduction does n't  necessarily work . Why is it your assumption that more teachers than not are ineffective ? ) <p> " When class sizes are lower , some teachers do not modify instruction accordingly . Many of the methods used with large class sizes are not always effective with smaller groups . " ( You make a blanket statement without any examples or evidence . Why do you think teachers do n't  modify their instruction ? Again , there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate smaller class sizes . ) <p> " This , however , relies on the assumption that with small class sizes , the teacher will give more time to feedback . Even then , how do we know if the feedback is actually going to be effective ? " ( You question teacher work ethic ( again ) and effectiveness here . Why would you hire a teacher that you did n't  feel was qualified to guide students in their learning ? ) <p> " This post does not mean that class size is not important but without effective teaching it does not make much difference other than to personal workload in terms of marking and , possibly , teacher classroom management . " ( Nothing matters more than teacher effectiveness , but effective teaching does n't  happen in a vacuum . The context of teaching impacts teacher effectiveness INCLUDING workload , behavioral interventions , parental support , administrative support , supplies , AND class size , along with a myriad of other things . ) <p> Tacking on a sentence at the end of your post acknowledging that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post that most teachers are not effective and are more interested in reducing their work than in student learning ( thus where I came to the conclusion that you believe teachers are generally lazy ) . <p> Teachers should be treated as professionalstheir daily experience in the classroom should not be discounted . We know our classes and individual students better than anyone , and we know that class size is SIGNIFICANT in terms of a students learning experience in the classroom . <p> Can I just say that Hattie is a University Professor from New Zealand who is in the business of telling American Public School Educators how to educate . And our politicians and administrators are actually listening This would be truly bazaar if it was n't so scary . <p> I understand that you are frustrated with class size in your current school . I would agree that there are schools where class sizes are too large . When looking at the impact of reducing class size , context is everything , but I do not feel we should be so quick to throw out educational research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I believe that Hatties research has been incorrectly interpreted by policymakers in many countries and this interpretation has not helped teachers in many respects . <p> Hattie does not claim that reducing class size will not have any impact on student learning . His research notes that it does have a positive impact but does not make a significant difference compared to other instructional methods employed by teachers . <p> In some cases reducing class size may have a huge impact , depending on the school context ; the teacher , the class , the students and the level of socio-economic advantage disadvantage in the area . <p> I mention in the post that reducing class size may not necessarily improve learning . There are cases where teachers are very fortunate to work in schools with low class sizes and there is not any significant change in methodology in taking advantage of the situation to improve student learning . <p> I hear from teachers like yourself , who appear to be doing a great job with large classes , too large in fact , that we are not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am hugely concerned , however , when there are teachers who have much smaller classes but the teaching practice is poor , or there is no improvement . These cases do exist . <p> I question if we reduced every teachers class size by 5 students tomorrow , would student learning be better in every class ? For some classes , yes , but for most classes , I think not . <p> An interesting discussion . At the top of Hatties list of things that have an impact is Feedback . Surely , feedback can be more effective and more targeted with small classes ? In fact , it would be possible to argue that many of the factors are correlated to class size ? <p> What gets my back up with Hattie is that his research is used to hit teachers over the head with by Right Wing governments , saying that " class size does n't  matter " , without recognising that actually , many of the things that Hattie says ARE important directly relate to how many students you have in your class .

Quite simply it has an impact how they see themselves as learners . <p> Great article and could n't agree more with the position on personalised learning and the need for greater learning autonomy .

Update <p> The idea that content is unimportant is something that formed the backbone of the progressive education movement , which was popular in American states schools in the 1920s and British state schools in the 1960s . I can understand why you want to gloss over the shameful history of these ideas , but I think it would be more honest if you admitted that you were arguing for a return to a past era rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . <p> If you did that I think you would be able to be more objective in discussing what has changed and what has n't  changed . Technology has n't  changed anything . Education was never about the speed with which you can look things up . You have to actually know things off by heart in order to use them when you think . It is knowledge and , our fluency with it , which gives us the ability to learn for ourselves and to be creative , not training in creativity of " learning to learn " . Our new knowledge of the brain confirms this You can find out by having a look at the books and articles of cognitive psychologist Dan Willingham who writes a lot of stuff aimed at educators . The empirical evidence from psychology also disputes the claim that " We all learn differently " . <p> This article , and in particular that video , seems to hinge on a number of myths about history , psychology , technology and learning . I would suggest you look into them and challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as grounds for a return to the failed tradition of progressive education . <p> One point of disagreement that I have with Treadwell is that he thinks there needs to be far great emphasis on- teacher accountability- whereas- I believe- in Andy Hargreaves opinion , in- The Fourth Way , that we should be focusing more on teacher responsibility. - Update

Relationships are not zero-sum in that if one person has a strong relationship , it does not mean that others can not as well . - Students need at least 2-3 strong , positive relationships with adults in the building . - These strong relationships often come with the knowledge of a students strengths embrace these . <p> Make the first contact about the strengths . - Make that first contact a positive one . - When we start the year , inquire into the strengths of our students inside and outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Run a class or school Identity Day .

One of the most powerful ways to not only change the teaching profession as a whole , but also as individuals , is through the act of blogging. - One of my favourite articles on the topic of blogging is from Dean Shareski , which he shares how he believes blogging makes better teachers . <p> Thousands of other blogging educators could echo similar words . In fact , I 've yet to hear anyone who has stuck with blogging suggest its been anything less than essential to their growth and improvement . I 've no " data " to prove this but I 'm willing to bet my golf clubs that teachers who blog are our best teachers . If you look at the promise ofProfessional Learning Communities that our schools have invested thousands , more likely millions to achieve , blogs accomplish much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have teachers share practice/data and work in teams to make improvements . A good blog does this and more . While the data may not be school specific , great bloggers know how to share data and experience that is both relevant and universal so any reader can contribute and create discussion . <p> Yet fear of the unknown is a powerful thing . - I have learned how hard it is to move people from a " known average " to an " unknown amazing " because of fear . - So for- some of the arguments I have heard against the idea of blogging , I wanted to provide some of my counter-arguments on the topic . <p> 1 . Blogging is useless . The thing with this argument is that I have rarely ( if ever ) heard this from someone who has consistently blogged on their teaching and learning for any amount of time . - As I was talking with a student the other day in a school who was about to start his own blog in class , he argued with me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " have you ever blogged ? " , to which he replied " no " . - I challenged him to give it one month , and a- legitimate- try and- then- offer me his thoughts , to which he said , " I will . " - Even in Deans article , he uses the same argument : <p> So here 's my plan . Hire a teacher , give them a blog . Get them to subscribe to at least five other teachers in the district as well as five other great teachers from around the globe . Have their principal and a few central office people to subscribe to the blog and five other teachers as well . Require them to write at least once a week on their practice . Get conversations going right from the get go . Watch teachers get better . <p> Try that . If it does n't  work after a year , you get my golf clubs . <p> PS . The only people allowed to criticize or challenge this idea are people who have blogged for at least one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can ask questions but you cant dismiss it . <p> It is easy to criticize something you have never done ( all of us our guilty of this , including myself ) , but to me , a viewpoint is not truly valid unless you have experience . <p> 2 . I have no time . - We all have the same amount of time and it is not like those who blog have 26 hour days , compared to the rest of the population . - It is not about time , but more about priority . - If people see it as important , they will make time . <p> So one of the things that I try to focus on is the importance of blogging for not only reflection , but open reflection . - The art and practice of reflection can help make ourselves better educators and learners . - For us to truly help students , we need to be masters of learning before we can become master teachers . - Reflection helps in that process . But " open reflection " helps others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , but also in making each other better . - Clive Thompson wrote a quote on how blogging makes us all smarter : <p> Having an audience can clarify thinking . It 's easy to win an argument inside your head . But when you face a real audience , you have to be truly convincing . <p> This " audience " helps us to- really- think about what we write and go deeper in our learning . <p> But that being said , it is hard to find time in your day to start the practice . - What I focus on is helping educators not focus on doing everything that they are already doing plus blogging , but looking at doing something different . - For examples , many teachers use what is called DEAR Time ( Drop Everything And Read ) , where students take a certain amount of time to read . Many teachers model the importance of reading during this time and take part in the practice . - Could you not change the " R " to represent the word " Reflect " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " time embedded in our week , could you not find the time to model the importance of reflection for your students by sharing what you have learned ? <p> There are things that you are already doing ( writing emails to others , putting things in word documents ) that can be easily thrown onto a blog instead . Again , it is not about- more- as much as it is about- different . Find what you are already doing in your practice , and think about how you can add that into a blog . <p> 3 . I 'm a private person . - Blogging does not mean giving up privacy . - There are things in my life that I keep totally private in my life and do n't  share on my blog and I choose what I am comfortable with . - You do not have to share your most personal secrets just because you have started a blog . Your level of comfort with sharing will change over time , whether you share less or more . - Every person is unique in what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out when teachers close their doors and do n't  want anyone to see what is happening in their classrooms . - This does not mean that bad things are happening in the classroom , but sometimes the perception because of this practice paints a different picture then what is actually happening . - When we are taking care of other peoples kid throughout the day , I think that we have to try and find some comfort level in what we share . - I understand that this is a tough one for so many people ( and understandably so ) because it is easy to be criticized and have our words morphed online , but that being said , working with a generation of students where public is the " default " mode of practice , should we not put some of ourselves online to understand the importance of developing our own digital footprint ? - Many teachers think that not sharing anything online will ensure they- never- have a footprint , but the only thing that is a certain as that they will- never- have a footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities of our world that we do have to help kids navigate as educators , and we should try to find a way to put some of ourselves online . <p> 4 . No one cares what I have to say. - Out of all of the arguments listed , this one bothers me the most . - First of all , if I was to ask the same teacher who uses this argument to- not- blog an interview question along the lines of , " what learning can you share with the rest of our staff that will help us become better as a school ? " , I highly doubt their response would be " nothing " , and if it was that , I would struggle to hire them . - Yet too many educators , sharing feels like bragging , and modesty often trumps their comfort level in posting their teaching and learning online . <p> I get it . <p> But if we are really here to help kids , does it matter if they are in our grade , our school , our class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share can help someone else , maybe not everyone else , but someone . - They may not take what we share exactly the way it is written , but if they turn it into something to help their kids , is that not worth it . - Just remember , if you impact only one teacher , you often impact at least 20 kids , if not a whole lot more . <p> One of my favourite videos on this topic is , " Obvious to You , Amazing to Others " , which has a great message on the impact we can have on one another : <p> Our impact on one another as teachers should never be underestimated . <p> I am not in the camp that says , " Everyone should " , with any tool or platform .

@@58740336 @7740336/ <h> We must make time for clarifying questions and responses <p> School leaders , regardless of the position held , take on a number of tasks at the same time , so many in fact that the To Do list never ends . Leaders are constantly juggling tasks , which may include reacting to situations that have arisen , carrying out tasks to maintain effective function of the **26;124;TOOLONG , or leading and supporting the development and implementation of new initiatives to improve our schools . <p> As leaders are consumed in the tasks they do and the busier they become at certain times of the year , leaders can often lose sight of the need to communicate with their colleagues . When we find ourselves short on time owing to the number of tasks that need completing our communication can become rushed or non-existent in the eyes of our colleagues .

This includes making time for our colleagues to ask clarifying questions such as : <p> What is the rationale for this decision ? <p> Why does the task need to be done this way ? <p> What are the next steps with this project ? <p> Good leadership , however , is more than just making time for colleagues to ask pertinent questions , it is about having the emotional intelligence to consider answering the questions before they are asked . This places leaders in situations where they are more proactive than reactive in meeting the needs of others . Leaders may even bring up the questions that their colleagues may want to ask but may refrain from doing so , for fear of the inconvenience of asking .

@@58740338 @7740338/ <h> How school leaders can address teacher workload issues <p> Much is said in the media about schools being stressful places and , perhaps , education is nearing crisis point in terms of what is being asked of teachers . Workload is an issue that simmers on and , if not addressed , can have a significant impact on staff morale and school culture . It is , therefore , of little surprise to read that teaching is one of the most stressful professions to enter and be a part of . <p> While external agencies and government bodies play an obvious role in creating teacher workload and stress through their mandated requirements , school leaders also make decisions in either contributing to or alleviating the problem . We should not , however , ignore that teachers themselves may use practices that are neither effective nor efficient , making things harder than they should be , further compounding the problem . <p> While many schools have invested in well being initiatives for their schools , the issue of teacher workload surfaces time and time again . For all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not changed , then undoubtedly matters pertaining to teacher stress will continue . What 's more , dare I say it , if we do not take time to discuss and address how teachers can be more effective and efficient , workload matters will linger on . <p> So , what can school leaders do to address issues teacher workload in schools ? <p> See the big picture and address issues with teachers being pulled in many directions <p> There are many leaders in a school , not just the Principal , who make decisions that can negatively impact on teacher workload and stress . It is vital that this is acknowledged and , when discussing workload , a bigger picture is considered . Teachers are pulled in multiple directions , often completing requirements for different leaders within the school . Commonly , the various leaders in the school do not collectively consider what they each are demanding of teachers . This is a serious problem , as each leader may only consider their patch and unaware that requests of teachers to complete tasks are being made made simultaneously . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and have a firm grasp on the overall picture and can work with their group of leaders to consider the number of requests made of teachers , the priority order and achievable deadlines for completing the task . Too many tasks on the table for teachers to pay attention to , or complete , leads to a danger zone of being overwhelmed and feeling that you can not get the job done ; a feeling that many school leaders know only too well . Similarly , the establishment of realistic deadlines for requests to be completed shows a sense that school leaders are in touch with what teachers are faced with on a day to day basis . <p> 2 . Determine what is necessary and unnecessary <p> Leaders also need to carefully consider what is necessary for teachers to do . They can play a significant role in looking at what external agencies and governments require and minimising the impact on teachers by addressing only what is important . Schools should not be slaves to external agencies and their requirements . Plenty of consideration should be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in decision making processes that can create and alleviate workload . <p> Obviously , not everything in schools is externally mandated and school leaders are largely responsible for the schools internal processes . Leaders should come to school each day thinking about how they can make life easier for teachers to get the job done . This can be achieved by considering the basic needs of teachers and equipping them with appropriate resources in a timely manner . It can be as simple as having a school calendar that is followed and disruption to classes is minimised , with everyone knowing what is going on . Furthermore , it could be improving systems of communication , which can often be a source of frustration and stress for teachers . <p> Leaders can make things easier for teachers in schools and they can also take things away . The latter is easier said than done , though if one stops to think about it , there is a lot of unnecessary workload and perhaps leaders in schools are making things harder than they need be . Consider , how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught and assessed curriculum is what is is being done effective and worthwhile ? <p> Leaders have have to make tough choices in terms of what the school or a particular section of the school , will do or what it will not do . Even in taking certain things away to reduce workload not everyone will be happy but it may be necessary ; individual teachers have their pet loves and their pet hates . These decisions have to be carefully considered and tread a fine line in terms of how much leaders end up telling teachers what to do . <p> If leaders are seen to be making genuine attempts to address matters pertaining to teacher workload it is certainly easier to begin to enter discussions with teachers about how they too can be more effective and efficient with their time . <h> Related <h> 3 Comments <p> Great work .

@@58740343 @7740343/ <h> Five important things to know for new and aspirational school leaders <p> Hindsight is a great thing . How many times have we said , as school leaders , I wish I knew that beforehand or I wish I was prepared or trained for that ? Probably too many to mention . It is , therefore , pleasing to see that more and more programs are being developed to support new and aspiring school leaders . <p> In this context , school leader pertains to any person- holding a formal leadership position within their school and has responsibility for leading and managing staff . I deliberately say staff , as school leadership involves working with a wide array of people , not just teachers . Perhaps this is where we should begin in terms of the five things all new and aspiring leaders should know : <p> Look after and make the most of your support staff : In my opinion , the support staff in schools do not get enough recognition for what they do . They make it happen , from cleaning to maintenance of IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the support staff the small details necessary to ensure that schools function smoothly are not there . Take time to appreciate your support staff . The simplest way is by saying hello ' and taking an interest in them . The janitor is just as important as our best teachers , so make them feel valued . While so many schools spend a lot of time investing in professional growth and learning for teachers , not enough consideration , in my experience is given to developing and training the support staff . <p> Be prepared to apologise for mistakes that are not necessarily yours : - When we take on leadership , the buck stops with us for either the whole school or a certain portion of it . We things go wrong , parents or senior leaders wish to speak with the leaders . Subsequently , we can spend a lot of time apologising for mistakes that others may have made . Frustrating , yes , . So , our role , as a school leader , becomes one of working hard to ensure that mistakes do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Spend time giving feedback to your staff and thank them for what they do well : - Timely feedback is essential for all of us to improve . It is great to receive positive feedback about what we are doing well , similarly , even though we do not always take criticism well , we want to do the best job possible . So , feedback regarding things that are not going so well is equally important for school improvement . Feedback , crucially , may involve engaging in some tense and difficult conversations at times , where specific improvement is required . <p> Model the way for others to follow : - No-one likes a leader who says one thing and does another . It is vital that that leaders model the values that they espouse . If we promise something , then we must deliver . Too many instances of leaders not walking the walk ' will lead to a toxic culture of cynicism and distrust . Leaders need to be a beacon of trust that inspire confidence in our followers . <p> Rome was not built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership role and we are excited and enthusiastic that we are in a position to make the changes that we feel are necessary . Beware that moving too quickly can backfire . Time needs to be spent ensuring that our team(s) buy-in to change and see a clear rationale for it . Similarly , adequate support must be given to changes so that they do not fizzle out , once that initial energy has subsided . Incremental improvement is essential to having most people on board and ensuring changes that are lasting and positive influence student learning . <p> Most of all , remember , leadership is challenging , if it was not , then a lot more people would be putting their hands up to take on leadership role . It is interesting to speak with those who have opted out of leadership citing burn out , difficult staff , not having support , amongst other things . It is easier to opt-out of leadership than to opt-in but we need to give our new and aspiring leaders all the support possible , so that they stay with leadership in schools in the long-term .

The smart and wealthy know the value of their time . They see each minute , hour , day , week , month , and so on as an opportunity to invest wisely in themselves . You must do the same . <p> As it has been said before , time is the most important currency you will ever spend , because once you spend it , you can never get it back . - Personally , I am very guarded with my time .

Yet it is also important to understand that my priority may not be your priority , and if I force my priorities on you , I am asking you to spend your time on something you do n't  value . <p> Schools and organizations are guilty of thoughtlessly spending the time of others for their own needs , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new initiatives " and the principal that comes back from a conference with the next " best idea ever " . <p> Examples of this are rampant in education . Have you ever noticed when it becomes " survey season " in your school or district ?

In leadership positions , if you want people to move forward , valuing the time of others is not the only thing you need to do . - People need to see that the use of their time is an investment . - Here are three suggestions to help move someone else s time from the expenditure to the investment column . <p> Start with the " Why " . - This statement has almost become a cliche , but things do not become cliche unless they resonate. - Simon Sineks amazing Ted Talk pushed people into thinking more about " what " they do , to " why " they do something . This quote is directly from that talk : - Every single person , every single organization on the planetknows what they do , 100 percent.Some know how they do it , whether you call it your differentiated value propositionor your proprietary process or your USP.But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.And by " why " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result .

As a result , the way we think , we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in , its obvious.We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations " regardless of their size , regardless of their industry " all think , act and communicate from the inside out . Simon SinekWhen people see that what they are doing gives them purpose and that it is something bigger than themselves , they are more likely to want to be a part of it . - I believe the vast majority of educators all want to make a difference in the lives of their students , so if they see something that comes along the way and they- believe- that it will have that impact , they will more likely jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why " of anything that happens within education , it is the equivalent of answering a student when they ask , " Why do I have to learn this ? " , with the response , " Because I said so . " - Believe that people want to be part of something bigger than themselves and make an impact , and start from there . - If they understand the " why " behind anything , they are more likely to invest their time , but if they do n't  , it just becomes " another thing " . This leads into the next point . <p> Give Ownership. - So if people understand " why " , do they see it as your process and vision , or " ours " ? Do they have ownership over the vision and the process ?

" Not only will they not want to tear it down , they will want it to grow . - When you see the growth of the- organization is on " all of us " , not just " some of us " , the experience that we create daily for our students becomes a reflection of our efforts .

In learning organizations , is your focus on everyone being at the same point at the same time , or everyone moving forward ? - If people know that constant growth and development is valued , that is what they will do . But if everyone is compared to everyone else based on " results " , many will lose interest ( I am looking at you " testing culture " ) and eventually tap out , whether you know it or not . - When people know that you will both push and support them , the notion of " risktaking " is a lot less scary . - They also begin to understand that the investment of time , is ultimately an investment in themselves . - Value growth and it will lead to a much better " product " long term . <p> I believe thisyou cant change people .

One view thinks administrators have no work to do ( or do n't  do any work ) , so they just stroll through the building looking to meddle in teachers business , while the other view is appreciative that they and their work are a valued commodity in the learning environment . <p> Teachers , I respectfully request that you leverage the luxury of another education professional in your classroom .

I started blogging and created both a personal Twitter account and a professional account ( my personal account eventually lost out to my professional account thus the " formal " @MrWejr ) . <p> He also gave me an idea to create a Facebook Fan Page for the school . He said that it would be a great way to communicate and share the great things happening at the school as well as a way to post interesting links , images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school was a bit of a frustration for many teachers and administrators so I pushed that aside for about a month to think about it . A colleague and I were discussing Facebook and he mentioned that parents at his school had created their own Facebook Page for the school and were leaving some negatively toned comments on topics such as head lice and behaviour . At that point I decided to take ( at the time ) a risk and I created our " Parent Info For Kent Elementary " Facebook Page . <p> Parents immediately loved it . I could post information and great things happening in classrooms at the school from my phone as the day progressed . Some school and district staff were a bit concerned as to the conversations that would happen in the public domain ( without their knowledge ) . After some dialogue , thoughts and an experience with a post that would be better discussed in person , I disabled the Discussion Board . I completely managed the messages on the page ; only I could post while others could comment but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things have gone extremely well with our Facebook Page parents love it . We have grandparents and other relatives , former students , and community members ( businesses , reporters , etc ) that " Like " the page and therefore get constant updates on their Facebook Page . It is THE best way to showcase the great things that are happening at our school . <p> I just finished reading " Essentials for Principals : Communicating &amp; Connecting With Social Media " by Bill Ferriter ( a brilliant and key member of my PLN and a teacher from North Carolina , @plugusin on Twitter ) , Jason Ramsden ( a chief tech officer at a school in North Carolina and @raventech on Twitter ) and Eric Sheninger ( a high school principal in New Jersey and @NMHSPrincipal on Twitter ) . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANY EDUCATOR CONSIDERING USING SOCIAL MEDIA AT THEIR SCHOOL . The authors challenged me to be more transparent and increase the use of social media by stating , <p> While establishing strong lines of communication within the schoolhouse has always been essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communication beyond the schoolhouse has become more important than ever . Faced with shrinking budgets and constant scrutiny in todays accountability culture , public relations has quickly become a new priority for principals . After all , informed communities tend to care more about their schools . ( p.5 ) <p> Principals who take the time to respond honestly to teachers , students , parents , and community leaders in the digital forums they have already embraced will soon find that they are building communities of enthusiastic supporters who feel connected to one another and to their local schools for the first time . ( p.10 ) <p> We have to be willing to open ourselves to criticism and to interact directly with important stakeholders in order to be taken seriously . ( p.10 ) <p> Following the reading of this book , I opened our Facebook Page for others to post as well as added the Discussion Board . We may end up with some controversial topics on there but my feeling is that these conversations are already happening and I would rather the school be a PART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate closely and encourage more face to face dialogue to happen in the school . <p> We need to break free of the communication that we have used in the past and move to one that encourages dialogue and two-way communication between parents , educators , students , and community members .

It has become more and more vital for educators to be more and more detailed with specific and direct instruction on how to communicate in a respectful manner in and out of the classroom . Often email , Facebook , and voicemail become one-way paths to send emotional messages and unfounded complaints and demands . <p> It is also important to recognize than in every community there are families that do not allow the Internet in their home . Also , in every community there are those that do not have the money for computer access at home , especially in highly transient states with large immigrant populations . <p> One more thing to keep in mind is that despite teacher emails , websites , and Facebook pages there are many students and parents that do not make an effort to use any of these tools . Curiously , they do spend a lot of time using these same social networks to communicate and stay informed with other things . That goes back to the shift in values and bell curve of human behavior LONG ... <p> Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I work is in a lower income area and access is definitely an issue . We would never have online communication as the ONLY communication as that would work to further marginalize those in our community . Social media is a tool that should be used in addition to the phone calls , newsletters , and emails . I have to say that I have had more positive response about our Facebook page from parents and the community than any other medium we have used . <p> Your other points are also very important and that is why we need to continue to model effective use of social media . <p> I think just from an enrollment standpoint social media is a huge platform for schools . I 've heard a lot of schools ban the use of Facebook by faculty because of ethical concerns , however , I think the " ethical problems " are extreme cases . A lot of people now have separate and personal Facebook/Twitter accounts . Plus , a Facebook or Twitter account is an easy way for teachers to contact parents . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough for a busy faculty and administrators . <p> I used to be one of those people who were strongly against Facebook and other forms of social media . However , I have come to realize these can be strong tools if used appropriately . Society , in general , is ever-evolving and we clearly see that there is a strong shift from traditional methods of teaching , learning and working to twentieth century teaching , learning and working . Long gone are the days where we see no or even one computer in the classroom . Even more evident is the way teachers colleges are training new teachers . Technology is being heavily promoted and used because it is such an effective tool in communicating . For instance , the use of cell phones . I know many people are against the use of cellphones in the classroom . However , we need to stop thinking about the fact that its just a cell phone . Its more than that . Its a standard and scientific calculator , global media , a computer , a GPS , a remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even regulate the use of certain forms of technologies such as cell phones and encourage the use of Facebook , schools should really start planning on ways on how to incorporate such tools in the classroom especially since majority of the world has one . <p> I completely agree with you . My wife was a teacher in Tucson , Arizona , and recently we have moved to the Phoenix area after her charter school closed . A lot of her time was spent telling students to put their phones away , or stay off Youtube and Facebook . However , she is now a guidance counselor for an online high school , and the most effective form of communication for her to reach students is Facebook . So , in a sense she now wants students to be logged on to Facebook regularly to stay up to date on their progress . <p> I wrote a short blog post about this subject on my companies website . Upon researching this subject , I found a lot of teachers/schools embracing the new technology . Some teachers are using group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , study guides and so on .

Although , you have to draw a line somewhere and make sure students are n't  abusing the use of this new technology . <p> Great blog post ! I definitely notice the shift in the need to incorporate technology to enhance instructional methods . New teachers readily embrace the concept of using Facebook and even cell phones whereas , I still notice much resistance from those veteran teachers who still resort to traditional methods . Consequently , I believe these forms of instruction somewhat hinder student learning because students are born into a new world of technology . If you go on YouTube , you can find significant evidence of learning when you see two year olds using the iPad or young teens creating their own blogs . I agree with you in terms of the importance of embracing these new technologies and its nice to know that your wife has seen the value of incorporating facebook , which is often seen in a negative light , turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional tools and when used appropriately , authentic learning can take place .

Teachers can literally make changes in their lessons at that moment , for individuals or for a group .

We should prepare them to think for themselves and allow them to figure out the best way to solve problems . Therefore , I have to agree with Will . School should take on a new definition . <p> I absolutely enjoyed the video because it helped me realize how an educator with an obsolete mindset can become the obstacle that prevents learning for fertile minds .

We were working on an intense math problem when I had one of those uh-huh moments " the kind I used to describe to my students when I taught high school math in Andover , Massachusetts . The problem was a simple one to understand , but it had many layers of complexity to it for math teachers : <p> - <p> Imagine you are a peasant , and your ruler told you that you could have as much land as you could mark off by walking in one day . What is the most amount of land you could reasonably claim ? Give your answer in square miles and be prepared to support and defend your work . <p> Among the questions that came to mind when thinking about how to solve this problem were these : How many hours can a peasant reasonably walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many breaks will the peasant need to take ? Are their hills , mountains , or other physical obstacles that the peasant will encounter ? What kind of tools will the peasant have to navigate with ( i.e. a compass or a GPS ) ? <p> Very quickly , a group of us began to debate these questions and create a list of assumptions that we would use to derive our answer . We debated what type of a shape would produce the biggest area . With some trial and error and use of some mathematical formulas , we agreed that a circle might be the theoretical shape that would yield the biggest area , but the square was the shape that would be easiest for the peasant to trace , assuming they had a compass or could make use of a reference point such as the sun for direction . <p> My uh-huh moment came not because my team arrived at an answer that we felt comfortable with , it came because I realized that we as a math team were embarking on a revolution that was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The days of assessing students with multiple-choice , low depth-of-knowledge math questions would soon be gone .

My mind filled with excitement and optimism as I realized that our recent shift to a competency-based grading and reporting system was going to put our students into the driver 's seat as we implement the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics into our math classes this school year . <p> - <p> The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics <p> The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics ( CCSSM ) claims , by its own website , to be working towards greater focus and coherence .

These include things like : <p> Making sense of problems and persevering in solving them , <p> Reasoning abstractly and quantitatively , <p> Constructing viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others , <p> Modeling with mathematics , <p> Using appropriate tools strategically , <p> Attending to precision , <p> Looking for and making use of structure , <p> Looking for and express regularity in repeated reasoning . <p> For a math teacher , CCSSM is going to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the days when it was enough for students to be able to recall facts and perform very basic mathematical operations on summative assessments .

With the age of CCSSM , students will be called upon regularly to complete performance tasks " extended , complex problems that will challenge students at high levels , have multiple answers depending on how the student chooses to set up the problem , and focus students on supporting and defending their work . The problem I referenced at the beginning of this article is one that can be turned into a great performance task for students in middle or high school . <p> The new challenge for schools across the country is figuring out how best to implement and support CCSSM .

Students are assessed on their level of proficiency for each . A final course grade is calculated based on a student 's performance on these competencies through various summative assessments . <p> All teachers at Sanborn use common grading procedures such as reassessment , no zeros , and the use of formative assessments to inform instruction that can be weighted no more than 10% of an overall course grade . Behaviors , such as class participation , turning in assignments on time , and completing extra credit are NOT factored into academic grades but rather are included as separate behavior competencies that appear on report cards and our transcript . <p> Our competency-based system has put our math teachers in an excellent position to be able to adopt , implement , and support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathematics .

Quoting him : <p> In doing so , I found a stunning pattern I did not expect " every one of these super-innovators can identify a teacher who inspired them and helped set them on their course , but these teachers were- always- outliers , out of the norm , eccentrics , distinctly different from most of the other teachers . - Just as importantly , these outlier teachers had a set of qualities strongly in common with each other . <p> The 5 fundamental constants of the outliers : ( paraphrased ) . <p> 1 . - They presided over a classroom culture- not of individual achievement , but instead collaboration . - It is remarkable the extent to which we find again and again that innovation is deeply rooted in the power of collaboration , and we must resist the myth that inventors are creative by being solitary , uniquely creative , individual geniuses . <p> 2. - Their teaching practice was one- not of specialization but instead entirely multi-disciplinary " that is the norm of teachers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were wide-ranging , covering many topics and subjects , without regard for narrow disciplines or boundaries . <p> 3. - They asked of their students , and practiced with them- not risk avoidance but trial and error " try something , fail , try something different . - At the core and essence of innovation is the ability to learn from failure , and you have to facilitate an environment where students have to take risks <p> 4. - They promoted the value not of consuming , - but creating . - Their classrooms were places where students worked hard , and were serious about producing genuine , concrete , meaningful product . <p> 5. - They employed- not extrinsic , but intrinsic motivation with their students . <p> Tony added that his research among these young " super-innovators " found that- their parents actively encouraged wider types of play : play that was outside and out of doors ; play that was widely varied and creative ; play that was not limited to screens ; and play that allowed students many opportunities first to find and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by play and discovery . - He explained that this is an important process for innovators : " Play to passion to purpose .

Do we have enough of them ? - Are we recruiting them , and are we protecting them ? - Are there enough opportunities for them to " break-out " and innovate ? <p> 2. - We should ask about our students : do they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by trial and error ? - Are we asking them often enough , and pushing them vigorously enough , to generate and produce real product , to create rather than consume ? <p> 3. - Collaboration is essential : Dr. Wagner emphasized this repeatedly in his presentation , and certainly Steven Johnson , author of- Where Good Ideas Come From : A Natural History of Innovation , agrees . - But how do we distinguish , and help students distinguish , between quality and mediocre collaboration , and how do we help them develop the skills of effective collaboration that stimulates and supports innovation ? <p> The recent and important bookAcademically Adrift provides research findings that students are more successful demonstrating the thinking skills evaluated on the Collegiate Learning Assessment ( the CLA , the exact counterpart and analogue to the secondary school critical thinking assessment , the- CWRA ) when they study alone than when they study collaboratively. - These findings do n't  dictate to me that we should abandon collaborative learning environments , but that we need to work harder to help them be effective and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always need to review the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and seek to find the best and ideal blend ; Tonys important research here again underscores that we should be wary of the extrinsic and promote as best we are able the intrinsic . - A recent Atlantic magazine article by Lori Gottlieb , How to Land Your Child in Therapy , seemed to suggest that schools should not hesitate to award and reward highly accomplished students , because it is useful for the other students to realize their limitations early and not be deprived important life lessons of disappointment . - But it is the award- recipients , we can see from many research studies , who can be deprived their own sense of intrinsic motivation when we grant them awards and shower them with praise : my concerns and- hesitations about the culture of " award-giving " in schools is based more on what awards do to the winners than what they do to the losers . <p> My thanks go to Tony Wagner and to EdLeader21 for the fine webinar. - Readers can expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 3 Comments <p> Hi Jonathan , My name is Holly Fore and I am a student at The University of South Alabama in Mobile , Al .

It is why Benjamin Franklin helped pioneer new inventions and a new nation ; it is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Jobs championed Apple products . <p> It is what turns a job into a calling . <p> I heard a lesson from one of my favorite writers and teachers , Timothy Keller , where he explainted that people are often motivated by the two extremes : fear or pride . <p> Neither are healthy . <p> Fear motivates someone to take on a new challenge because he or she is afraid of the options ; it motivates us to react to the moment or to over-react to what others think about us . <p> Pride , on the other hand , is another unhealthy motivation that often leads to burnout . Pride often pushes us by appealing to our egos . We expect perfection and do n't  allow failure to be part of the learning process . <p> When we are motivated by fear or pride , we push instead of pull others along . <p> So what is a third alternative to motivation by fear or pride ? Keller says there are two alternatives : beauty and duty . <p> To put it simply , the most positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy or delight in pursuing and accomplishing the goal ( beauty ) . Or when you pursue a path because you know it is the right thing to do ( duty ) . <p> I like to think of these terms as wonder and purpose . <p> When I step out of my car each morning and walk the sidewalk to my school , I remind myself that I have the opportunity to make a difference . I try to remind myself of the wonder and purpose behind my job . <p> When you focus on the deeper meaning of what you do , it helps you view students as people , not projects ; parents as partners , not opponents ; and teachers as team-members , not employees . <p> When we approach life motivated by wonder and purpose , we begin to see how it changes the way we lead and learn . <p> Now Its Your Turn What motivations drive you to do your best work ?

@@58740391 @7740391/ <h> Four Strategies for Effective Educational Communication from Chen and Edutopia <p> Milton Chen , the longtime Executive Director of Edutopia , has a terrific new ( 2010 ) book , Education Nation . - John Robinson has very effectively reviewed and summarized the book at 21st century principal ; as John says , " Chen 's book provides many ideas for educational innovation and reform . It is a great addition to the 21st century administrator 's book shelf . " <p> The book deserves more attention , and I intend to write more about it in the future . - Here now though , rather than look at the whole , I want to draw wisdom from just one short section , in which Chen describes the " four special strategies we employ at Edutopia to document and disseminate these stories . " <p> What strikes me is that these same four , so effective for Edutopia , might be valuable guidelines for all educational blogging and on-line communications by educators . <p> 1 . At Edutopia , " we stay positive ; we learn more from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is so important , and helps to make Edutopia a consistently upbeat and affirming place to go . <p> In my own blogging , this principle is largely , but not entirely , honored . Most of my writing is about what inspires me or about what is happening in my school or others that I want to share . - That said , sometimes I find it important to sharpen my point of view by calling out what is n't working so well in education today , or responding critically to others who I think need to be challenged . - Sometimes I can not resist standing up to defend my point of view and my educational philosophy from those who I think are dead-wrong . <p> 2. - Edutopia uses " documentary films as our own " leading edge " to show visually what can not be communicated in words When I speak to groups , I always show our documentaries , and invariably , that 's what the audiences remember . " - Chen is absolutely correct about this , and Edutopia is a great resource precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddens me sometimes , because the written word is so precious to me and I so greatly enjoy writing , but I know that my blogging and my presenting is always enhanced when I provide video , and like Chen , it is a priority of my own growth as an educational idea communicator to develop my own " video-voice. " - On my blog , I 'm striving to showcase learning and educational developments at my school via video at least once a month . <p> 3 . " We focus first on what these innovations look like in the classroom , in what teachers and students do.So much of educational reform discussion is conducted on a general level Edutopia aims to answer the question : How should teachers act and teach in the classroom . " <p> My blogging often remains far too high-level and abstract : Chens counsel is profound even as it is universal and timeless , like Strunk and White : show not tell , use vivid imagery , ground your readers in the actual practice . Many contributors here at CP though consistently bring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail by detail . <p> 4 . Edutopia " strives to present all of our material in clear language , free of jargon , comprehensible to a parent as well as a professor . " - Chen is right , of course : we need to win hearts and minds of parents , teachers , politicians , and students , and to do so we need compelling words which resonate and inform rather than obscure . <p> This is something , I think , which Connected Principals is succeeding at brilliantly . - The writing here is writing informed by many years of writing newsletters to parents , and by writers who have to communicate every day to parents , students , and teachers .

If students score well on standardized tests they move on to the next grade level or graduate while their teachers receive favorable marks on evaluations. - These are forms of extrinsic motivation and will work in short-term , but performance will not be sustainable as those motivated intrinsically. - The same can be said for merit pay. - Pink has provided a compelling case as to why this will never work and this is supported by the research . <p> Students are not motivated by standardized tests , as they find no true meaning and value in them . - Teachers are motivated for all the wrong reasons , of which includes job security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows the curriculum and creates a teaching culture where creativity , exploration , critical thinking are scarce or non-existent . - It creates a culture that students do not want to be a part of and one that can only be sustained with the use of " if-then " rewards or carrots and sticks. - Is this the direction we want to go in ? - Do we want schools to squash creativity and reinforce a model that worked will in the 20th Century that will not prepare our students for their future ? <p> Seth Godin describes linchpins as indispensable components of an organization that are artists in their own right. - These individuals do n't follow a manual , but instead are guided by an urge to do what is right. - In my opinion we want to create schools that allow teachers to become linchpins because in the end students benefit from their creativity , passion , and innovative mindset . However , standardization follows in the footsteps of a century-old education model focused on industrialization , which influences teachers and administrators in a way where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system produces students that lack creativity , are fearful of failure , work extremely hard to follow directions ( homework , study for tests , not question authority ) , and are leaving schools with undesirable skills in a post-industrial society .

@@58740396 @7740396/ <h> Importance of Public Relations for School Leaders : 4 Tips <p> I know a lot of people who love Chick-fil-A because of the quality of their food and service . If you 've eaten there , you know how friendly they are to customers , you 've seen the fresh flowers on the tables , and you know how much better their chicken tastes than other fast food options . <p> As a school leader , it is easy to forget how lessons in marketing , public relations , or customer service also improve school climates . A couple of weeks ago , our district leadership team sat down with a Public Relations consultant , Jeremy C. Burton , who manages PR at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa , Oklahoma . <p> ORU has seen an upward surge in enrollment , ehancements , and development over the past few years , and positive PR has been played an important role for promoting their brand . I wanted to pass along four points Burton made in his talk and add some of my own comments along the way . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Making good decisions is the bedrock of good PR . Burton explained , " Do n't  underestimate the negative power of bad decision . " <p> No matter the size of your school community or the amount of resources you can dedicate to PR , every good public relations outreach begins with the decisions you make on a daily basis . <p> On example of this came during graduation this year . We had a lot of media attention for honoring an alumnus who served in World War II and had never received his diploma . We did not ask for the positive PR , but we received kudos messages and emails from states away . The good decision on part of our district to give honor where it was due brought us honor in the process . <p> 2 . Contextualize your decisions . Burton : " Giving context helps people understand the why when you do so in a clear and compassionate way Including your public in the process is even better b/c you build advocates for your position . " <p> One of my favorite analogies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the moon , you can only see the one side visible to the earth . You may understand the reasons behind a complicated decision but others may not be privy to the details surrounding your choices . When it is possible to share the context , you build stronger consensus . <p> For example , when our school district passed its last bond issue in 2012 , our superintendent held multiple community meetings to seek input from employees , patrons , and parents on priorities for upcoming growth . The final decisions were shared decisions that allowed community buy-in and support long before the issues were voted on . <p> 3 . Communicating with honor is important . During a school crisis or emergency , it is important to know who needs to be prioritized in contact and feedback . <p> Burton shared an example from a crisis at their university with a student death that involved an off-campus homicide . In that scenario , they prioritized contacts with parents , board members , admins , people closest to victim , and faculty . Then they shared condolences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Depending on the scenario , consider how you honor them through your contacts . <p> 4 . Embrace social media outlets , but do n't  throw the baby out with the bath water . As Burton puts it , " News media outlets thrive because we all want to know first . " <p> Learn how to utilize social media effectively . At the same time , do n't  forget to use traditional forms of PR as well , including press releases , newsletters , word-of-mouth , or whatever ways have worked for you before . <p> When it comes to new ways of communicating , the most popular social media outlets are still Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , GooglePlus . Students are using Instragram , so consider their go-to sources too . <p> Conclusion Schools can be complicated organizations with lots of moving parts . Although we may not be providing merchandise that people line up at the door to purchase , we are still serving something of value everyday : education . And we can still be about the business of promoting positive messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and embracing social media as well as traditional outlets .

Before the school year began , I used the marshmallow challenge with our district cohort of first year teachers , grades 7-12 . But before starting the challenge , I gave them a paper math quiz . My colleague and I put together a series of questions designed to assess the math participants would use in the subsequent marshmallow challenge . Only a small group of the teachers would be teaching math , and the rest were terrified of being assessed mathematically . Their fear was evident , as was their struggle with the quiz . After a few minutes of " testing " I let them collaborate with their neighbors , and everything about their body language improved , although not everyone could successfully answer all the questions . <p> Once the test was over , I gave them the instructions to begin the marshmallow challenge .

Having said that , many of our colleagues ( including myself ) have understood anti-ed-reform as bold . Speaking to the ills of testing , inequitable funding , and value added evaluation is that boldness you seek from educators .

In my limited argument , I failed to state that we must proffer solutions to problems that we know exist . To simply state that ed reform is misguided without doing so , in my opinion , is wasted energy . I really believe that we need to be able to talk about what we are doing for our kids with the same veracity that we denounce " edeform " . With that being said , I applaud all efforts on behalf of making education the best it can be for our students . Thanks for taking the time to comment ! <p> I 'd agree we have to talk up our efforts ( Dave ) and feel free to be unapologetic in our opposition to reform we feel harmful ( Jose ) . <p> disagree that is as simple as offering " solutions " to issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( follow @pasisahlberg ) .

@@58740415 @7740415/ <p> The separated classroom with separate teacher model taken to the extreme - it has to change . We are no longer educating children to work in production lines - and in the developing world , this model would be a major factor in the 80-90% post school unemployment rate in many countries , simply because students have not been taught job creation skills . <p> Earlier this year I looked at defining the old paradigm ' classroom as compared with a new learning community ' model . What was immediately apparent was the emphasis that is given to separation ' in the one teacher , one classroom model . Separate and separated teachers work in separate classrooms , at separate desks , with separated class groups on separate programs with separate preparation " with students sitting in many instances in separate seats in separate rows . Get the picture ? No wonder conflict so easily arises in a separate ' model " tension rapidly escalating in confined spaces that can rapidly become a pressure cooker of emotions . It is not difficult to delve back into the origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a production line gradually contributing to the finished product . <p> A simple question to ask ourselves in this post-industrial era is why ? Why has schooling persisted with this model when it clearly is so fraught with emotional stress , professional isolation and out of touch with employment needs in the 21st century ? <p> I think I was most challenged to think this one through when visiting Rwanda " a wonderful country full of amazing people and a very tangible sense of hope . But one where the model of schooling has been based on a colonial hand-me-down of industrial era thinking . And what is the outcome of this traditional model of separated classrooms in countries like Rwanda ? ( and Malawi and other similar countries ) " incredibly high post-education unemployment because the education system for the large part has taught neither relevant job skills nor collaboration skills . It is often when you see something taken to the extreme " that you can clearly understand its flaws . <p> Where does the problem start for schools and teachers ? I 'd have to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not included training new teachers into collaborative work practices and team skills . I find there is a whole layer of un-learning and re-learning required for all teachers ( beginning or experienced ) when they come to work at NBCS/SCIL , because training teachers as a workforce for collaborative workplace models just does n't happen . Interestingly , once teachers make the shift and understand the intricacies of working within a team , they do not want to revert to the separation ' model . Our experience has been that an effective team approach will lead to some very desirsable outcomes : <p> Why teamwork ? Every leadership book I have read , or business exemplar that I have seen , that has a focus on the efficiencies of teamwork demonstrates the same thing : improved efficiency comes from strong teamwork . There would be countless examples in sport and in the natural world . Somehow scientists have worked out that geese flying in team formation are 71% more efficient than a solo goose . Industry leaders in innovative solutions such as IDEO provide outstanding examples of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to workplace environments which manage to strike a great balance for the employees between engaging ideas ' spaces , comfortable team areas , group tables and solo spaces . In Australia a number of large commercial offices have been designed around these scenarios " in order to readily facilitate collaborative thinking . Examples include : Macquarie Bank LONG ... Stocklands , Blackmores in Sydney and Westpac in Melbourne LONG ... Internationally the offices for Google , Facebook , Pixar LONG ... IDEO ( www.ideo.com ) all have similar design thinking . The evidence for productivity and inspired , creative and innovative thinking is obvious . School leaders could usefully look at these spaces for inspiration as they think about spaces for learning for students , as well as spaces for collaborative thinking for staff . <p> Great resource The website http : //www.p21.org has a lot of free material for education that highlights the relevance of teamwork and collaborative problem solving as core skills necessary for the 21st century . <p> So why have schools been so slow to re-think educational programs around collaborative models ? <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught to think this way . We therefore all have an inbuilt default ' button based on our own experiences of the industrial model and in the midst of busy schedules , we simply revert to the known . The solution ? We need to reset our default button around different thinking . We need to focus on what it means to teach collaboratively " and my experience is that is far bigger than just team teaching with a colleague . Teams need to inherently understand the rules of collaboration , of team of united goals . That takes time and constant focus . We held a very interesting seminar session in 2011 where the members of different team approaches ( about 30 teachers , a third of our workforce ) used the open space group process to define the optimum skills for successful participation in collaborative approaches and then set about to describe the requisite personal and professional skills to make such environnments work well . The resultant statements were fantastic " and a very useful tool for future team members . <p> The future ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communities Framework ( LCF ) . It is constructed around four pillars ( CARE ) : culture , authenticity , relationship and engagement . This framework will be shaped into an easy-to-digest format this month . The LCF does not attempt to be prescriptive in terms of approach , rather provide the framework for team thinking as they consider curriculum delivery models . Of note is the critical importance of relational skills learning is a relational experience and a teacher 's role is to create the conditions for learning to occur : a creative director of curriculum . That would appear to be a far more motivating role for teachers on a day-to-day basis . As human beings , our DNA is hard wired ' to be relational . The implication of this is that for authentic , deep learning to occur , it needs to take place in environments where relationships are functional and inspirational . Students need to be set up for success . One critical function of a learning community is to establish positive , collaborative environments with high expectations of student success in learning . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped . <p> Teachers are the backbone and strength of the learning community . All should be on the spectrum of good to great ' as professionals .

The difficulty lies in shifting the culture of a school to develop a collaborative culture , in which doors are left open , peer observations are welcome and teachers discuss and share their practice .

@@58740417 @7740417/ <h> Can Googles 80/20 rule work for schools ? <p> I recently had a short conversation about innovation in schools and the constraints that may be placed on teachers preventing much needed new learning and innovation . A point was made about schools taking the approach of Google with their 80/20 rule and setting aside time for teachers to be creative in areas where they are interested in promoting student learning . <p> For those who are unfamiliar with Googles 80/20 rule , the main idea is that employees at Google are given 20% of their working time to work on other projects that are " company-related and they are passionate about " ( New York Times , 2007 ) . Daniel Pink in his book Drive , which looks at what lies behind employee motivation ( see video above ) , provides a similar example with the Australian company Atlassian . <p> First , let 's consider where this discussion began . The discussion stemmed from the notion that teachers are , perhaps , unable to be innovative because too many constraints are placed upon them ; there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the creative and innovative process is somewhat stifled and there is a frustration from teachers that they can not put into action many of the great ideas that they have . Certainly , I can see this argument , I too have my to do someday wish list that I may get to address more quickly if were not for all the other urgent and important items that I need to do . <p> So what are all these other urgent and important items that may stop us from being as creative as we would ideally like to be ? Oftentimes they are things that perhaps we do not consider to be important from a personal point of view , but from a school operational point of view have to get done . Then there are the external demands placed upon us , what does the District or the Examination Board need us to do ? At times , we can wonder whether we are actually involved in education and promoting student learning . We 've all been there . <p> In saying this , if we were to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-related , how well would that time be spent ? In many cases very well but in other cases no differently to now . Let 's get real here , not every teacher in the building wants to be there ; harsh but true . How do we agree on what gets dropped off the to list and who decides ? There is a certain truth in that many schools where teachers feel there is time to be innovative and creative , the leaders shield teachers from things that are deemed less important and an obstruction to good teaching and learning . <p> One of the things I have considered recently his how complex teaching is and every aspect of teaching that we are being asked to master for the benefit of our students . <p> Perhaps the nature of the profession is so overwhelming , as we demanded to be experts in all the above areas , we actually forget how much flexibility we do have to be creative and innovative in our classrooms . Perception matters and it is not always the reality . <p> For sure , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in many instances teachers are not being told exactly , step-by-step , how to deliver their lessons , nor are they observed or stood over in every lesson . So , the opportunity to be creative and innovative is certainly there , we just perhaps can not do it as much as we want to . It is similar to most things we enjoy in life but we keep trying to make them happen , if we want to . In there lies the answer , we may actually have more opportunity to be creative than we think . <p> Googles 80/20 rule would be such an efficient way for teachers to be able to explore and implement the Web 2.0 toold that are available . As this article pointed out , educators are so overwhelmed by what is expected of us in our daily curriculum and content.Finding that 20 percent is difficult .

On the student side , anyone working towards more than one goal needs summaries to keep track of the feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each focus on 30 different things over the course of a year , I cant keep everything in mind I need succinct reminders . <p> But , desperately , we try to avoid trivializing our students education , and what can a single number be but trivial in the face of a year of life spent in school ? <p> I 'm developing a software solution called ActiveGrade that I think can help by delaying the dreaded averaging moment until the last possible moment . It presents students , teachers , administrators , and parents with specific details instead of vague , averaged grades , but retains that succinct , comparable quality that we need grades for in the first place . The paradox still exists how do you combine these scores without losing the important information they hold but we have some exciting new ideas that go a long way towards handling it . We think averaging is inappropriate for most sets of scores , so we provide decayed averaging and a power model ( http : //activegrade.com/blog/ ? p=34 ) . We also think trying to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we invented what we call " Natural Grade Calculation " ( http : //activegrade.com/blog/ ? p=58 ) . <p> I hate to turn this comment into a huge ActiveGrade plug , but these are exactly the questions that inspired us to start working on ActiveGrade , and we have a little community of teachers and admins that are forming around it . I think were doing a good job of supporting teachers who have these questions . Thanks for the post its re-inspired me ! <p> Thank you Riley . I appreciate that you took the time to post a comment here and on my blog . Two different comments . Wow . <p> I am very interested in ActiveGrade , but I do n't  have the time before my next deadline to enter in all of my data . <p> I 'm curious why you chose a power function to model the decay . I 've read Dr. Marzanos work , I know that he uses a power function too . When I 've played around with the data , I find that a logistic function usually fits as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send you some of the data that I 've been playing with if you want to see it . <p> I have to make a decision about what to do , at least temporarily , in the next 24 hours . My next round of grades are due Monday at 3:00 . <p> Thanks for thinking with me and thanks for the encouragement about SBG . <p> The power model has a lot of flaws , and I actually prefer a decaying average an average that weights more recent assignments much more heavily than earlier assignments . My feelings about this are very strong and can only be expressed in a lot of words , but basically I think initial scores are n't  very important except as indicators when were analyzing trends . Decaying average and a power regression both use initial points as pattern setters only . I have n't looked at a logarithmic regression , but I 'm basically fine with any regression that weights the most recent scores more heavily than earlier scores . <p> I am absolutely *NOT* ok with specifically targeting high and low scores ( e.g. dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a students data ) , but that 's another blog post = <p> What ? ? You do n't  have the time to make the changes in your grading system before the deadline to enter your grades ? ? I suggest you have a conversation with your principal and explain why you need more time . I am sure he is like many of the principals and others who post here and would love to have that conversation so you can be successful as an instructor . I am sure he wont mind calling his central office and asking them to keep the grade entry portal open a few more days . <p> I think the problem here is that you 're trying to measure an unmeasurable factor . The generally accepted solution is to introduce a subjective " class participation " grade , or some such . The real problem is that teachers cant grade an individual student . They have to grade and teach whole classes . So that subjective grade just becomes " teachers choice " . Either they give it to a few teachers pets , average for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the troublemakers OR they just give everyone an A on that one . The other solution Ive seen is to calculate attendance into the grade , as if a lack of attendance would n't be reflected in the rest of their marks ( until you get to college ) . <p> I 'm afraid this problem does n't  have a solution . Grades ca n't be subjective for a long list of reasons . This is an unfortunate byproduct of our industrialized learning system . The only real solution is to change the paradigm drastically . I 've got my own developing idea of what that would look like and I hope to one day make it a reality . <p> While its true that we could spend a great deal of time trying to sort out these questions about the implementation of grades and homework , we might be better off asking why we are assigning grades and homework in the first place . <p> Second chance testing is a great way of giving the system what it wants without giving anything the kids actually need . <p> Im bothered by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's most disturbing is that this post concerns itself more with grading than learning . <p> Well Joe , I have to sat that I 'm a little surprised by your comment . I realize that it lacks context that you might need . I focus on learning with and for my kids daily , hourly , all the time . The easy way is to teach , test , average and move on ; I reject the easy way . <p> You say " Second chance testing is a great way of giving the system what it wants without giving anything the kids actually need . " <p> The traditional system , in my opinion , does not understand or want second chance tests . It really bothers many of my colleagues that my learners get to try again . I believe I am giving my learners something that they actually need . We work on learning , we stop and check . If they are not where they want or need to be and if they do n't  understand as well as they want , we will dig in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I am not holding everyone to the same pace ; I am offering them time to learn . Coaching customized to their strengths and struggles . <p> It is about the learning , not a schedule . <p> However , to stay employed , to have the opportunity to help kids learn , to work on changing the system , I have to measure and assign grades a minimum of 4 times a year . <p> How will the system change if we do n't  discuss alternate ways to measure/report learning ? <p> Are you recommending that I not spend time grappling with how to best represent learning with the grade I am required to assign ? <p> Two things came to mind as I read this : 1 ) use weighted grades so that the cumulative midterm receives a weight to reflect its worth 2 ) the grade debate deserves more in-depth discussion from educators . Some years ago I read Robert Marzanos " Transforming Classroom Grading . " I was skeptical as I began the book , but I was very impressed by the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post does a really good job of laying out some tough questions about grading and how to represent a students level of understanding . I disagree with Joe that your post focuses on grading instead of learning . In everything , we learn by trying , making mistakes , getting feedback ( either from others or from observing the outcome of our mistakes ) , and trying again . Grading is ultimately feedback and therefor an essential step in the learning process . What matters is how we treat grading , how we use it to help the student reflect and keep going . Sadly , for many , it has become the focus , the thing that matters . It is clear from your post that you are focused on how best to help students learn and not punish them for that learning with a grade that does not best represent what they have accomplished . <p> I am trying to think about the questions you 've raised and I have so many thoughts in my head . In the second example , of the student who got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to that 52 . I think its helpful to think of skills on a scale of mastery . If he got a 52 , what does that indicate about his level of understanding . A 52% is quite low in one regard . On the other hand , if he understood about 1/2 of the questions , he knows and understands quite a bit more than nothing . He s clearly learned *something. * He could maybe even be considered more than a novice . Once we frame it that way , we have to decide how much a student *needs* to learn in order to be ready to move to the next class . If 100 means total mastery , could do it with my eyes closed and hidden inside a hugely complicated problem with many steps , then that 's probably more than each student needs to understand . And its possible that that level is different for each skill . Maybe they need to have a very firm grasp of exponents but just need some basic understanding of polynomials , in which case a 52 might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I think you are raising excellent questions and 2 ) I think reframing the way we think about the scale and considering what level of mastery is actually necessary can help us give more accurate feedback ( and grades ) . <p> Michal , Theres a new development from the learner that you focused on . We have taken another test . On the first chance test , with no partial credit , he scored an 86 , well above his first chance test average . This most recent test continues working with quadratic functions and solving quadratic equations . He has worked hard to overcome the 52 . This latest test shows his effort is paying off . You should see the improvement in his written work . Finally , after hours of work and coaching , he has begun to document his work to record this thought process . His written work has improved dramatically . Is it because of the experiences ? It is because he is growing up ? Is it because he is tired of working with me after school ? Probably some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more confidently report a number for this child . But what do I do for others that do n't  fall into his category of " the struggle caused him to learn ? " What about the child that can handle one topic on a test , but struggles to put it all together on the cumulative tests ? <p> Again , I 'm opening myself up for criticism from Joe by talking about grades . It is really about their learning . If a childs scores are 81 , 78 , and 60 , then I need to intervene and help . They need support . They are not retaining the information and skills . It appears to me that it was put in temporary memory rather than learned/mastered . <p> I agree that reframing is neededand soon ! We can complain about it forever , but when are we going to try something ? I 'm not really asking for a solution , though that would be great ; I 'm looking for a next step . <p> I appreciate your thoughtful response . Thanks for thinking with me , and thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> here 's my example of my most successful grading and evaluation process . Within it is a strong assessment process as well . for those of you still using assessment and evaluation in one sentence , please stop . <p> Heres what I did a few years ago with my grade 8 math classes : <p> 1 . Lnk the curriculum items across the strands of math . For example , I taught evaluating algebraic expressions , then area of a recatangle , followed by factoring numbers ( we used rectangles to help understand factors ) . thee concepts build on each other and teach kids that math is not compartmentalized into algebra , geometry , and numbers . Look up " Math 44 " for details . <p> 2 . Stop having unit tests I had weekly and monthly quizzes coving the topics of the week or month . No UNIT TESTS ! <p> 3 . Create a portfolio-based method of assessing learning . For each learning outcome , students had to demonstrate their understanding in at least 2 ways including one test . <p> 4 . Students assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record student progress in a spreadsheet , but do not calculate averages <p> 6 . At the end of the term , meet with each student and have them provide a rationale for the grade they think they deserve on each learning outcome ( 1-4 scale ) and for the term ( letter grade ) . If I idsaggree , I make them prove their understanding in a third way . <p> 7 . Finally , assign a " work habit " grade ( required in my province ) based on their effort in class and completion of required work . Do not confuse effort with learning . <p> Hi KyleThanks so much for your comment ! My team has decided that we will not give unit tests next year ; we will offer regularly scheduled assessments that spiral the learning that should be mastered . <p> I 've also been working on a " negotiation " plan where my learners can build a body of evidence ( portfolio ) to persuade me and work to collaboratively determine their grade . <p> I would absolutely love to see any forms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at jillg@westminster.net . <p> My principal , who made the post , is working with us to develop a balanced assessment plan where our learners have multiple ways and multiple opportunities to demonstrate their learning . Our assessment study group and PLCs are focused on assessment for learning . <p> We are moving to 1:1 next year in our JH . I 'm hoping that my learners can chart their own progress in a spreadsheet shared with our learning team . I 'm a big believer in charting your own growth and sharing the information with your learning team . <p> The argument about whether to grade or not and how to grade has gotten more and more interest over the last few years and I 'm glad it has . As a math teacher for nearly 20 years I have struggled with examples ( every year ) like you have given here . It is so easy to give a grade to a hard working , always scoring nearly 100% , likable student . It is also fairly easy to give a grade to a kid who is never there , disrupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the 80% of the class can ( and do ) perform all over the charts . Our school is a New Technology Network school . We are 100% Project Based and we assess in learning outcomes based upon 21st century skills ( in addition to the content grade ) and , based upon weighting , a grade is calculated . Some of the learning outcomes assessed include : Written and Oral Communication , Collaboration , Work Ethic , Numeracy , and Global &amp; Community Engagement . Each of these areas are graded upon a rubric created for each project . So , in the current project my students are working on there is no grade for Written Communication but there is a grade for all of the other learning outcomes . The key to grading with this system is understanding the weighting . It is very easy ( if you are not paying attention ) to get a high ( above 80% ) grade in Algebra , for example , if the weighting of the learning outcomes besides the Algebra are too high . Just picture that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is n't necessarily the best math student in the class . He speaks well and writes well and gets above 90% in all of the learning outcomes . But , his quizzes , tests , and the algebra part of his presentation are not sound and he has demonstrated that he is not knowledgeable with the content . It would be bad to send him on to the next teacher with a grade above 80% . And , therein lies the biggest stumbling block to changing the current 0 100 scale , as I see it . Teachers , parents , higher education , and the community understand a grade of 83 . Anything else starts to set in motion a sense of doubt that content has been covered and that the student has mastered ( in this case ) about 83% of the material . But , I think we need to continue this discussion because I think if there are enough brave schools , school districts , and states then the change could happen and I would find that exciting .

Since a very young age , she has wanted to follow in her mother 's footsteps and become an emergency room nurse . My school is preparing her for that demanding career with a competency-based model that has been designed to help her master a series of academic competencies , academic behaviors , and college and career-ready skills . Our competency-based model engages Amanda in her learning in ways that traditional high school models never could . <p> Five years ago , the administrative team in my school district and I began suggesting that our school make the move to a competency-based grading and reporting system .

The career and technical education ( CTE ) teachers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , applauded our efforts to move the school district to the model that they had always used to define their work . <p> In the world of CTE , the idea of holding students accountable for their learning and assessing them on their mastery of course competencies is not a new concept .

They would n't and i <p> f they wish to remain alive , they do n't . Yet why do schools cling on to roles ? We do n't think like businesses . Schools are excellent vehicles for recycling old ideas and not changing .

They will be the priority projects we are seeking to embed . A team leader will steer the boat .

The implication with this metaphor is that an anchor will at times be down and the focus will of necessity be on the sea floor ' of activity , but at other times , with the dispersal of responsibilities , the team members of the new boat ( e.g. embedding PBL consistently K-12 ) will up anchors ' and be able to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of getting covered in barnacles " something that would eventually likely sink the whole boat : our goal will be to get team members to continually empower their teams to take up micro-responsibilities and grow themselves professionally . <p> At the same time we are viewing our working spaces differently .

We have worked with schools who have budget problems and slashed fees and book costs , helped them learn to host other schools and split the costs , and the schools/districts who have done this have seen test scores rise , referrals go down or be eliminated completely , and have retained teachers who will willingly say they 're happier . On top of that , our one day training is eligible for 1,2 , or 3 graduate credits . It seems for those who believe in research , thered be no question about exploring our time-tested techniques , and for those who are n't  so research-oriented , talk to those who are elated their principals thought enough of them to invest the time and sometimes money to help them be teachers .

Perhaps attending an educational technology conference I should have shown more interest in the technology . And , I admit I was wowed by the technology . More significantly , I was moved by the learning . <p> I gained more than I ever expected , experiencing a shift in a paradigm I had embraced and that has shaped my leadership in recent years . In the very first session I attended Monday morning , Michael Fullan , in true motion leader style , motivated me ( ok I was already motivated , but supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher and by extension the role of principal from facilitator of learning to activator of learning . <p> Quoting John Hattie , Michael Fullan relayed that there is a .17 effect size on student learning when teachers act as facilitators of learning through problem based learning , simulations and gaming , and individualized instruction . Alternatively , there is a .84 effect size on student learning when teachers serve as activators of learning through offering feedback , accessing thinking , supporting challenging goals , and monitoring learning . It does not take extensive training in statistical analysis to find this research compelling . <p> I know , we love problem based learning , simulations and gaming , and individualized instruction . And , Michael Fullan did offer appropriate caution in our interpretation of Hattie 's findings , positing that gaming , for example , as currently utilized may not yet be effective but that skilled teachers may develop high quality use . Still , without dogmatic either/or " facilitator or activator " lines in the sand , I accept and appreciate Michael Fullan 's redirection . <p> Michael Fullan activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction , but also with some concrete steps as to how to move forward .

What matters is what has mattered for millennia : the quality of our relationships , our respect for one another , and the supportive environments we create . I spent the rest of the conference attending some fantastic sessions , learning some impressive technology tools , but most essentially , connecting and engaging with others who care deeply about learning .

We need to seek a learning partnership with students where all are seen as learners and learning is a task that only happens when all are partnered to meet a common goal . If students view themselves as part of a group with a common goal , and feel like a valued participant , learning tasks and projects will become more meaningful for them .

@@58740453 @7740453/ <h> Solitude , Leadership , Concentration and Twitter <p> Solitude and Leadership , the title of William Deresiewiczs- much circulated- American Scholar article intones. - Solitude and Leadership : - one can not help but lower ones voice and slow ones enunciation as the title is enunciated . <p> This piece has been shared with me by many , the estimable David Brooks recently cited it as a top essay of the year : there is indeed much wisdom to be found in it . - - But before I relay that wisdom , a caveat : - Deresiewicz- creates a false dichotomy which simply is n't supportable : solitude and concentration are valuable elements of leadership and independent thought , but they do not exclude , in any defensible way , - the possibility or even as I would argue the probability that there is great parallel and synergistic value derived from an immersion in the crowd and the stimulating , creative , multitudinous energy of our contemporary Forum , Twitter . <p> The piece , which indeed everyone should read and discuss , is in two parts.First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leadership we have in our nation today , something I know many of my associates and colleagues in educational innovation will concur with : we need educational leadership which is anything but complacent , but is independent and courageous enough to stand tall and say firmly that education must change . <p> For too long we have been training leaders who only know how to keep the routine going . Who can answer questions , but do n't know how to ask them . Who can fulfill goals , but do n't know how to set them . Who think about- how to get things done , but not whether they 're worth doing in the first place. - What we have now are the greatest technocrats the world has ever seen , people who have been trained to be incredibly good at one specific thing , but who have no interest in anything beyond their area of exper-tise. - What we- do n't have are leaders . <p> Deresiewicz- is profound too in his definition of leadership , and I think that I speak for many educators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived from independence of mind , and our passion and our calling is to educate independent , creative , critical thinkers . <p> What we do n't have , in other words , are- thinkers . People who can think for themselves . People who can formulate a new direction : for the country , for a corporation or a college , for the Army " a new way of doing things , a new way of looking at things . People , in other words , with- vision . <p> What makes a thinker " and a leader " is precisely that he is able to think things through for himself . - And because he can , he has the confidence , the- courage , to argue for his ideas even when they are n't popular . Even when they do n't please his superiors there is another kind of courage , moral courage , the courage to stand up for what you believe . <p> In the second half , the essays project is to explore a question which is also important to educators : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you learn to think ? " - His answer , however , and regrettably , is one part prophetic and one part polemic , and I believe that in his need to launch a rhetorical bomb his thinking misses a critical step in a deeply disappointing way . - - First the prophetic : <p> Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it . Not learning other people 's ideas , or memorizing a body of information , however much those may sometimes be useful . Developing your own ideas . In short , thinking for yourself . <p> You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating . <p> It 's only by concentrating , sticking to the question , being patient , letting all the parts of my mind come into play , that I arrive at an original idea . By giving my brain a chance to make associations , draw connections , take me by surprise . <p> So solitude can mean introspection , it can mean the concentration of focused work , and it can mean sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> Powerful , meaningful , significant , and accurate . - Much of my most important thinking happens when I am alone : hiking , cycling , in the shower , just sitting in my office staring into space . - Absolutely , a room of our own , whether literally or mentally metaphorically , is a prerequisite for original thought . <p> But , and I feel like shouting , there is no reason a thinker ca n't or shouldnt also be fruitful by engagement with the swirl of the intellectual currents flowing around him or her . - Deresiewicz- ca n't seem to abide the simple concept of both/and in this part of his essay , and instead falls into the failure of either/or binary thinking . - Here , it seems , his lovely and philosophical essay becomes nothing other than an under-informed , narrow-minded , un-original and nasty polemic about Twitter and Facebook . <p> You simply can not do concentration in bursts of 20 seconds at a time , constantly interrupted by Facebook messages or Twitter tweets , or fiddling with your iPod , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration this way ( some can ) , but the two different modes do n't  have to happen at the same time . - A creative thinker can spend many hours a day doing exactly these things , and then retreat into moments , minutes , or hours alone . <p> Concentration means gathering yourself together into a single point rather than letting yourself be dispersed everywhere into a cloud of electronic and social input . It seems to me that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube " and just so you do n't think this is a generational thing , TV and radio and magazines and even newspapers , too " are all ultimately just an elaborate excuse to run away from yourself . To avoid the difficult and troubling questions that being human throws in your way . Am I doing the right thing with my life ? Do I believe the things I was taught as a child ? What do the words I live by " words like- duty , - honor , and- country " really mean ? Am I happy ? <p> The answers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comedy Central or even in- The New York Times . They can only be found within " without distractions , without peer pressure , in solitude . <p> These are - just- unsupportable- assertions . - On what possible basis can he successfully establish that we should and can only find wisdom , or independence of thought , or philosophical understanding of our lives , by retreating to an intellectual island ? <p> Thinking for yourself means finding yourself , finding your own reality . Here 's the other problem with Facebook and Twitter and even- The New York Times . When you expose yourself to those things , especially in the constant way that people do now " older people as well as younger people " you are continuously bombarding yourself with a stream of other people 's thoughts . You are marinating yourself in the conventional wisdom . In other people 's reality : for others , not for yourself . <p> Has Deresiewicz considered the history of philosophy at all before writing these sentences ? - Socrates , Aristotle , and Plato lived , thrived and flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engaged in discourse and debate with the Sophists each and every day . - Hume and Rousseau had their Enlightenment coffeehouses , Hegel and- Heidegger- their German universities , Sartre and Camus their Parisian cafes . <p> Let 's turn for a moment to Steven Johnson and his wonderful recent book , Where Good Ideas Come From . - My review of Good Ideas and its applications to education is here . - Again and again and again Johnson documents , in a remarkably comprehensive compendium , that the original thought that innovation demands is highly socially situated , is highly collaborative . Our most original thinkers surely needed and used solitary time and concentration , but only and always , Johnson establishes resoundingly , in tandem with highly social , interactive , immersion in the crowd . <p> It used to be , Johnson documents powerfully , that innovation and original thought could only happen in the intense crucible of our largest urban sites : Athens , Rome , Florence , Paris , London , Berlin . - - But now , amazingly and wonderfully , we have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fora , and its name is Twitter ( and facebook and a dizzying array of other Web 2.0- sites ) . <p> I look forward to speaking to my students and citing Deresiewiczs- wise words about the essential quality of independent thought for true and effective leadership , the leadership our nation does indeed deeply need , but I will only do so while also summoning the spirit of Socrates in the Stoa , urging our students to discover and develop their- creative and original thought from the- intellectual stimulation which can best be found today amidst the fruitful ferment of our transformative technological cosmopolis that is the world wide web . <p> Perhaps your title could have been : " Solitude , Leadership , Concentration and a Community of Learners " <p> The reality is that to many the concept of Twitter is still that it is about telling the world that you are meeting up with friends or that you are going to the dentist . They do n't  see it as a learning conversation or a place where you find interesting articles that lead you on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socratic conversation before the quiet contemplation . <p> I followed a link yesterday , watched a video , and spent about 4 hours writing a post in solitude afterwards . Without my online connections , I would have been uninspired . <p> But to those inside Platos cave , those who only see Twitter as a single dimensional shadow of conversations and connections to those Twitter is a distraction . For me it is a learning opportunity , and a learning network . So , I have to agree with you Jonathan , " On what possible basis can Deresiewicz successfully establish that we should and can only find wisdom , or independence of thought , or philosophical understanding of our lives , by retreating to an intellectual island ? " I 'd say on the basis that he s stuck in the cave , looking at shadows . <p> David , your title is a fine alternative . It better captures the broader idea that I advocate for and believe in . <p> That said , I hoped this title might be a bit more catchy and current , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about Twitter ; if you read the second half closely , it begins to appear the author is obsessed with Twitter and its danger . <p> I greatly appreciate your picking up with my metaphor and taking it into Platos cave : how well that metaphor captures the negative aspects of the " intellectual island " Deresiewicz seems to demand of thinking . ( Some of my very favorite memories of ten years teaching was teaching the entirety of the Republic to a seminar of high school seniors ! ) . <p> Funny coincidence : in my initial brainstorming about responding to this piece , I had intended to cite as an example of independent and non-complacent thinking your recent , excellent post , Question Everything .

@@58740464 @7740464/ <h> 6 Tips on Dealing With Difficult People <p> If you are like me , you want school leadership to be about inspiring or encouraging others to reach shared goals . So often , motivational leadership also requires managing complicated situations or people . <p> Over the years , I have begun to learn practical skills in dealing with people who are upset , angry , or just plain mean . <p> I do n't  always do it correctly , but I believe with practice , anyone can learn to maximize the potential of finding solutions in conflicts . <p> Whether you face challenging people on a daily basis , or only occasionally , here are some tips I have learned from my own experience as well as watching others who consistently manage difficult people : <p> 1 . Make sure you are not the difficult person . Most of us do n't  like to admit it , but often our own attitude , demeanor , and level of patience significantly affect the way we interact with someone in a difficult moment . <p> When someone comes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they are distressed about their own situation or someone elses , they are often anticipating resistance . So , the first thing I try to convey in those situations is an open , welcome , and listening attitude . <p> Instead of immediately going on the offensive or defensive , I try to let them know I am glad to see them and want to help . <p> I also try to gauge my own temperament . In the school setting , it is not uncommon to immediately go from one high stress Cailis canadian farmacy situation to another . So , I try to remind myself that the person I am encountering has not seen my whole dayjust the very moment I am in . <p> Likewise , I have not seen his or her whole day either . By keeping in mind that I need to not be the difficult one , I am more likely to really listen and often decrease some of the heightened emotions involved in the difficult situation . <p> Do n't  assume the best communication is when you 're the only one speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem or even with a confrontation , if your goal is to find a solution , you first have to understand the problem . <p> One practical tip I learned from my mentors has been to take notes when someone is sharing concerns . First , this helps me keep the thoughts and the details they are sharing in front of me so that I can separate the facts from the emotions . <p> Second , it demonstrates to the other party that I take their concerns seriously . Many times , when people feel confident that the problem is being taken seriously , a difficult meeting can turn into a bridge-building opportunity . <p> Sometimes understanding requires some coaching . I worked with a great assistant principal who would say , " I 'm having a hard time understanding . Help me see the video in my head of what you are talking about . " <p> This was a great way to give the person permission to calm down , be specific , and feel understood . Good problem solving happens not only with a good picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the generic propecia online conversation . <p> 3 . Be firm but friendly . Granted , there are times when a difficult person completely misunderstands the facts . And bluntness is not always off the table . <p> So do n't  be afraid to tell the truth with kindness . When you do , you will gain the respect of the listener much more than excuses or non-committal statements . <p> A good example of this was a fellow administrator I knew who once yelled at a student who was skipping classes . The boys mother came to the school very upset that her child was being disciplined and that the administrator had yelled at the student . When the parent confronted her , she simply told the truth . <p> " Yes , Mrs. Smith , I did yell , " she said . " I found your son in the hallway trying to sneak into the gym after I had just confronted him ten minutes earlier for loitering in the halls and had told him to be punctual with getting to class . When I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would my own child for being disrespectful of our time and wasting his own . That 's when I escorted him to the office and called you . " <p> The mothers countenance softened , she sighed , and to my friends surprise , she said , " Can you help me learn how to deal with him ? He never does what I tell him to do at home . " <p> Obviously , I am not advocating yelling at students , but my friends polite frankness turned a potentially volatile situation into a learning moment for everyone involved . <p> 4 . Change your posture or use humor when appropriate . You will be amazed how disarming it can be to an angry person when they are greeted with a smile and a handshake . <p> Sometimes sitting at your desk is appropriate for a meeting , but at other times , I like to come out from around my desk and sit together at a table or in matching chairs to speak to someone . <p> Closed fists or crossed arms convey anxiety or frustration , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees or desk , or I take notes while pausing to make good eye contact . All of these mannerisms convey that we are not enemies but allies . <p> Even when you are explaining or conveying information that is hard for someone else to hear , it is often much easier for them to accept it when your body language conveys you are relaxed , not attacking . <p> I also find strong words are more effectively delivered in a calm voice . Will you always do this well ? No . But try to purposely practice these postures in order to create the best setting for a good conversation . <p> Also , if appropriate , find something in the situation that you can eventually laugh about . With students , that is not difficultthey provide lots of good content for humor ! <p> 5 . Agree to disagree . So , what do you do when you have tried all of the above , but the other person is still upset or disagrees with you ? Remember the goal is about what is best for everyone involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If someone has a reason for still disagreeing or being unsatisfied , give them specific instructions for how to appeal that concern to someone else in the leadership structure . <p> Even if its a matter that goes nowhere else after the immediate conversation , sometimes it just helps to say , " You know . Were just going to have to agree to disagree . " You 're not ending the conversation by saying , " I 'm right . You 're wrong . " You may not even be changing a decision , but you are demonstrating the desire for mutual respect even in the midst of a disagreement . <p> Remember in the business of school , you will most likely encounter this person again in the community , at a ball game , or maybe even at church . <p> You want to be able to look them in the eye and know that you still treated them with the dignity you would want someone to show you in a disagreement . <p> 6 . Consider Bringing All Parties to the Table Sometimes resolving conflicts requires more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , bringing them all to the table helps shed light on the situation and makes it easier to cut through misunderstandings and reach solutions . <p> Learning how to resolve conflicts among parties could be a whole post by itself , so I will save that for another time . <p> Conclusion : At the end of the day , none of us likes confrontation or difficult moments . Most people are prone to fight or flight . But there is another option . <p> By checking your own motives , seeking to understand , remaining firm and friendly , maintaining an open posture , sometimes agreeing to disagree , or bringing all parties to the table , you can go a long way in turning difficult conversations into more positive outcomes . <p> Now Its Your Turn : Can you think of a time you were able to deescalate a tense situation or person ?

@@58740471 @7740471/ <h> My Mentor , Colleague , and Friend <p> Memories flood back at the most interesting and unpredictable times . Last Sunday I was heading through security at the airport on the way to Washington D.C. for ASCD 's Leadership Institute for Legislative Advocacy . After pulling my shoes off and pitching them into a plastic carton , I noticed a TSA officer who was a former student years ago . After the usual pleasantries , Cory surprised me by saying that he thought of me recently. - Today is the 25th anniversary of the Challenger disaster and the passing of my friend and mentor Christa McAuliffe . I was a second year teacher when Cory was my student , just two years away from my student teaching year- with Christa at Concord High in New Hampshire . Cory remembered the tragedy and like all students in my school , he knew our relationship . <p> Christa was a natural teacher . She would often arrive last minute to school , her hair still wet , holding her daughter Caroline by the hand , while rushing to the Concord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was always ready for instruction , never giving any clue of the frenetic working-Mom life she led . <p> When I heard that Christa was selected from over 11,000 applicants to be the first teacher in space , I was not surprised . Christa was smart , hard-working , ambitious and a quick study. - I remember watching her on the Johnny Carson Show thinking that she was as natural in front of millions of viewers as she was in front of 25 high school juniors . I wrote to her in when she was in space training , utilizing a special code on the envelope that would slip through the thousands of other well wishers . Christa promised to come to my school and speak about her adventures . <p> Of course , our school was watching with great anticipation on that fateful day , January 28 , 1986 . I was looking forward to watching Christa 's lessons in space and admiring her friendly and direct teaching style . Like her Tonight Show experience and all of the media attention , I knew that Christa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trepidation . Unfortunately , none of us would ever experience that . <p> Not surprisingly , Christa 's contribution to our field was significant after her death . She was not able to offer her own talent beyond that terrible January day , but her legacy remains . Teachers around the country have identified with her famous quote , I touch the future . I teach . Many young men and women chose to become teachers due to the attention Christa gave to our profession . A number of schools have been built throughout the country with her name on them and conferences are named in her honor , including our well known New Hampshire technology conference . Many grants have been established in Christa 's honor as well . <p> I hope this difficult anniversary brings attention to the fine work of teachers everywhere and to communities who value teaching and learning and believe in strong community partnership . Christa 's example to all of us will endure . <p> ( Continued from my last entry that mysteriously evaporated mid-sentence ) . So a group of us at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters expressing such grief from states and countries so far away from Concord , New Hampshire . What a blessing to read the handwritten words of these writers , young and old , who shared personal experiences and their own hopes and dreams that Christa McAullife inspired . I 'm sure I was not the only one that sat , pen in hand , shedding many a tear as I responded to these cards and letters over the months that followed Christas death . She represented the best in all of us and even twenty-five years later I swallow hard seeing her photo , remembering that moment of the Challengers short lived flight and the huge sadness that followed . And yet what an amazing legacy as well Thank you Bill Carozza for sharing your own memories and thus inviting others to also remember Christa.

I know that many schools have such targets and I have often contemplated the impact of doing so . <p> Performance targets can give us something to aim for and a schools reputation may grow from it being able to say that their students received this result and that result , which makes them better than other like schools . There is , however , a significant downside to being a results driven school based on student academic success . <p> The biggest downside , in my opinion , is the associated pressure placed upon teachers to achieve these results and that the support needed for teachers is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve . In some cases , teachers are faced with an impossible task and falling short of the set goals can have a devastating impact on teacher morale and could be viewed as detrimental to keeping good teachers in the profession . <p> Pressure has knock-on effects . The worst impact of a student results given goals is when teachers and school administrators , in too many instances , tell students " you cant . " In order to achieve particular school-wide statistics , students are told the the subjects and the study track that they will take . This is not necessarily in the best interest of the student but more in the interest of the teacher and the school at large . In extreme instances , if a student is not going to get the highest grades in a course , then they may be told that they can not do it . In fact , the student may actually have the ability to take on the course and do quite well , but for the sake of preserving the class average , they are either deterred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular course . <p> This is especially damaging in some schools , where we should be instead telling students , " you can .

Obviously , this needs to be tempered with a level of pragmatic reality with respect to the students abilities , but to tell a student that they can not do something to protect an average score is just plain wrong . <p> Schools , especially fee-paying ones , in competitive market places present student results statistics to parents as a marketing strategy to get enrollments . Unfortunately , until parents have their children in the school do they then see the reality . The good average scores seem great at first until it is their child that is told that they can not do something that they are actually capable of doing , then it begins to hurt . <p> Schools have an obligation to help students reach for the sky and achieve the best they can .

Leaders who lose touch with what is happening can not act spontaneously , so they try to do what they think is right. - If that fails , they often try coercion. - But the wise leader who loses sense of the immediacy become quiet and let 's all effort go until a sense of clarity and consciousness returns .

The Tao of Leadership is one of my all-time favorites . You can pick it open anywhere and be lifted by an idea . I especially liked the one that contrasts the warrior and the healer .

Ive come across plenty of teachers who have warned me about common core and I know it makes me wary about teaching .

@@58740494 @7740494/ <h> A Time for Reflection <p> So here we are , a week into a brand new year with all of it lying stretched out before us . A clean slate of endless opportunity and promise , just waiting to be brought to life with each new day . I love coming back from the first semester break honestly , because I get to hear all about the holiday adventures , and I get to bask in all the smiles as we gather together again as a community . Students and teachers seem refreshed , and renewed , and excited to begin again , and eager to make this the best year of their lives . There 's a positive energy in the air that is palpable , with everyone eager to start the new year off on the right foot . I wrote a post a couple of years ago that I 'd like to highlight again today , as I think it still rings true as we start 2016here is a piece of that post that I hope will resonate with many of youmaybe for a second time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year , the conversation inevitably turns to New Year 's Resolutions , and all of the amazing changes that people are going to make in their lives . From quitting smoking , to getting in the best shape of their lives , to spending more time with family , or to being a better correspondent to old friends . We all start the year with super high expectations and a new commitment to a better life . For many people however , these resolutions are empty promises that for whatever reason seem to fade before we finish the climb to spring . So instead , I want to encourage everyone to think about some New Year 's Reflections , and to use the promise of a new year to better yourselves through a focus on the how and why of change , and through a commitment to purpose and meaning . <p> In my opinion , the act of reflection is the most important part of learning and growing as a person . Whether it 's personal or professional reflection , the power of looking back is paramount . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , your reaction to things that may not have gone your way , or even the way you see yourself , your worth and your value to others and the world.this - is remarkably profound . Without reflection , the opportunity to discover yourself and your potential is lost . Taking the time to think about how you learn , how you teach , your relationships with students and colleagues , and how you can give every aspect of your life more meaning is a necessary step before you make those concrete resolutions . <p> So with that said , I want to wish you all an amazing 2016 , and I truly hope that its your best year to date . Make a point this year to continue to learn , and to grow as a person/educator , and to take risks , and to reflect on what 's going welland what you could be doing better . Were only one week into the new yearwith the endless possibilities stretched out before usso reflect on the past year , look longingly to the future , and most importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small , simple , day to day choices which make up and affect our lives , so take the time to reflect early and often , and watch your year begin to take shape into something beautiful . A clean slate is a gift for us all so be purposeful about how you bring this years portrait to life . <p> Have a wonderful week everyone and remember to be great for our students and good to each other . here 's to an amazing 2016 ! <p> Life I am the New Year . <p> I am an unspoiled page in your book of time . I am your next chance at the art of living . I am your opportunity to practice what you have learned about a life of reflection and giving . <p> All that you sought and did n't  find is hidden in me , waiting for you to search it out with more determination . All the good that you tried for and did n't  achieve is mine to grant when you have fewer conflicting desires . All that you dreamed but did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not will , All the faith that you claimed but did not have these slumber lightly , waiting to be awakened by the touch of a strong purpose . <p> I am your opportunity to renew your allegiance to a life fulfilled I am the New Year . 
@@58740496 @7740496/ <h> 5 Reasons Your Portfolio Should be Online <p> " My prediction is that in the next ten years , resumes will be less common , and your online presence will become what your resume is today , at all types and sizes of companies . " Dan Schawbel , 2011 <p> Having a conversation with teachers and administrators , I asked how many of them still had " paper portfolios " . Surprisingly , it was over half of the room , and many of them had developed it in university , updating it only when job opportunities arose . - I remember actually having a paper portfolio and applying for jobs , and hating the process of dusting off a binder , adding a ton of great information into it , only to walk into an interview and have the person hiring not even look at it . - It was extremely frustrating as I had put a lot of work into it , only to have it ignored , and I never really understood why . <p> And then I became a principal . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited amount of time to talk with them and interact , the thought of flipping through a binder with them sitting in the room in front of me , seemed a little ludicrous. - I wanted to spend as much time getting to know them as possible . - At the end of the interview , sometimes they would offer to leave the portfolio with me to peruse at my leisure and they would either come back to pick it up or I would have to mail it ( does anyone go to the post office anymore ? ) . - I might have been the exception in my process a few years ago , but this is becoming more of the norm now , not only in education , but all aspects . - A portfolio could be great for the process of an interview , but should n't the things you do help you get the interview in the first place ? - Sending mass binders out to potential employers does n't  make much sense . <p> I believe it is time ( it has been for awhile ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Here are some reasons below . <p> 1 . The Google Factor We talk to students a lot about developing their digital footprint , yet how often do we help them build this footprint in schools ? - A digital portfolio is hugely beneficial to this type of work as it helps you to create your own online presence and shares the great work that you , or your students are doing . - The nice thing about a digital portfolio is that it is also not limited to text , but can be anything that you can see or create . - If I want to be a photographer , animator , actor , athlete , or anything else , digital can help share that information and make it accessible to others . - A portfolio that is able to bring together all of these different elements into one space will make your " footprint " that much better and easier to find . <p> 2. - Searching and Organization- My own blog is a " portfolio " of my work ( if you want to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have been working on for over four years , in a constant and continuous basis . - That is a lot of information over time , but with thoughtful " tagging " and " categorizing " , I am able to google myself and find my own work . - For example , if I want to find any time that I referenced " Daniel Pink " , I simply do a search for his name om my blog- and voila ! - Even using something as simple as " Command + F " ( " Control + F " on Windows ) can help me find a word instantly on amy page . - This is much easier than flipping through pages in a binder . <p> 3 . Anywhere , any place , any time access- If you were to have a paper portfolio and I asked to see it while you did not have it in hand , how would you get it to me ? - If you ask my for my portfolio , I would simply give you the URL to my website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about applicants that had an online portfolio to share with me. - It was accessible before , during , and after an interview and at my convenience . - In a world where there is always a shortage of time , accessibility at a time of- your- convenience is important . <p> 4. - Creating opportunities instead of looking for them - In a market where jobs are scarce and a university degree guarantees nothing , the competition for positions is tough . - With a online portfolio , especially one that continuously invites people to look at it ( every time I write a blog post and you read it , you are looking at my portfolio ) , you have the ability to have opportunities come to you , instead of the other way around . - I know many people that have simply shared the work that they have always done on their online portfolio , and then were asked to speak at conferences or consult with schools , simply because their work was visible . - Simply sharing your work is not enough to create those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing that you share that someone else will deem valuable to their organization and call in your expertise . <p> 5 . Continuous learning - One of the most powerful things I have found by doing an online portfolio is the growth in my own learning that I have done by sharing . - By simply knowing that other people will see what I write or share , I put a lot more thought into what I am doing . - I also find tremendous value in the comments and conversation that is started from some of the things that I share ; they push my learning . - If we are to look at online portfolios as both a way to " showcase " and " learn " , they are hugely beneficial to our growth . <p> Although I have listed several reasons why an online portfolio is beneficial ( and I am sure I could list a lot more ) , many educators are happy where they are in their career , and would argue that there is no need for them to have an online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - My belief is that if we are truly doing what is best for kids , we have to learn how to do it ourselves to help our students in the future . - going to be . " - We need to look ahead for our kids sake . <p> Another question that I get is , " Well what if no one googles me ? - Then I have done all of this work for nothing . " - To be honest , if you get not one single opportunity from an online portfolio and- only- went deep into your own learning , is n't that still a pretty good thing ? - The other suggestion I would make is that when you submit a resume , right at the top of it share the following : <p> " For more information , please refer to my portfolio located at " . <p> This ensures that you lead people to the great work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a difference between a " digital " and " online " portfolio . - An online portfolio is usually digital , but it is not necessarily the other way around . - There are many benefits to both professionals and students to share our work in an open way . - As- Chris Lehmann- has said before , - " it is no longer enough to do powerful work if no one sees it " . <p> Where can I see your powerful work ? <p> Resources <p> If you are interested in some help for Online Portfolios , here are some links : <h> Related <h> 4 Comments <p> Thanks for the push to get me started with an online portfolio .

It is all about relationships with students , staff , parents , and the community . If you have good rapport and relationships with all stakeholders , they will do anything to help you attain your goals ! <p> Thank you for the comment . I think you are exactly correct ; relationships are and will always be the key to any success in any job . I hope to use any and all my time in the halls to talk with students and be proactive to build strong relationships with as many students as possible . Congrats on 3 years as a building principal ! <p> Great list of personal/professional goals for a first year in administration ; I especially liked the one about teaching class . When I was the Dean of Students for two years , teaching a class was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be other administrators that principals teaching is n't the way we do things around here and that there is n't any time for it . After a year back in the classroom to reflected , I know that it SHOULD be the way we do things and there is enough time . I encourage you to go for it ! Next year my half-time tech integration position becomes full-time , but I have worked with my building principal to make sure I have students for clubs and advisory . He informed me that I 'm the first teacher at the school to ever request to have an advisory class . Cheers and good luck ! Tim <p> Thanks for the comment . Fortunately I have already spoken with my new building principal and he totally agrees with getting in the classroom to teach when possible . That must have been difficult being told " that is not how we do things here " by your co-administrators . I am not really a big fan of that phrase , because I think we should always be open to new and different ideas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year that has come in handy was to keep a notebook and every single time somethng came up that I thought " Oh ! I should do it way next year ! " I wrote it down . I have like three pages of ways that I wanted to remember to make adjustments for in different situations . From things like changing the way I track grade level data to bigger things , how much time needs to elapse after a teacher has a bad day before I say something to her . As my year closes today ( woohoo ! ) I am so thankful that I have these reminders of how to hit the ground running .. <p> I 'd also HIGHLY reccommend rereading ( if you 've read ) " How full is your bucket ? " Its an awesome reminder of how we need to suppoert , encourgae , and lift up our teachers in the trenches . <p> Last , one more thing I do , I set up auto send emails that say hi , have a good day , and you 're doing a GREAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everysingleteacher on my campus . I space them out throughout the semester , just for a lilpick me up , so they know that I am thinking about them and supporting them .

You are definitely a great resource with a ton of valuable information : ) . We read " How full is your bucket " in my book club this year ; the entire building will be reading the book this upcoming year . Thank you again for the very specific and concrete examples of ways to ease my transition into the administrative role . <p> All very good commitments Justin and a good review for more seasoned admins . I wish I had a list like this when I started out . <p> Getting into classrooms to teach or supervise can be tough . What 's worked best for me was to specifically note it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing to it . IF it needed to be switched , I would change the appointment . When I did this I found I could cover a lot of classrooms and interact quite a bit . I genuinely said to teachers , " I am interested in what you do in your classroom , so I can learn from you as well . " <p> BTW , if you want to teach more , come to Saskatchewan . Rural schools here still have the VP and/or principal teach ( as I do now ) . = <p> This is excellent advice as I move toward for my first principalship . I really hope that by being more visible and involved with classroom activities students and staff will see me as more than just " the assistant . " I hope to be an integral and active part of the learning environment , which should in turn reap huge benefits when it comes to building and establishing relationships with both students and staff . <p> Nice Post , Justin !

They give students a chance to see you , parents notice , and is a great way to start conversations with teachers . As an AP , and even now as a principal , it was easy for me to get chained to my desk , but I work with my Admin Asst to set my schedule and protect those days on my calendar . <p> It will definitely be a team effort , and I think " protecting " that time will be absolutely essential in making sure I can get to the classrooms as frequently as possible . Most importantly , I need to remember to smile and have fun = <p> I am starting a new administrative role this year too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrepadition as I begin this new role . I think taking the time to write out your goals and vision is a great idea .

I have written about the why and how , but the- question that comes up in workshops is : how do I determine the strengths of my students ? <p> An important activity is for students to understand that each and every one of them has strengths . - These can come in the form of activities ( ex. dance , hockey , math , etc ) and in the form of character strengths . It is also important to share what these strengths could look like in each student ; strengths are not something that a student needs to be the best at but more about personal skills , qualities , traits and virtues that students have developed . - For a poster of 24 character strengths ( developed by Dr. Martin Seligman ) click here . - This poster can be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent them . - For middle and high school students , I recommend watching the short film " The Butterfly Circus " as a way to lead to deeper dialogue on the view that every person has strengths and it depends on the perspective we choose . <p> Through the work of many passionate educators whom I have had the chance to work and/or learn with ( in schools as well as online and in workshops ) , I have come across the following ideas : <p> " All About Me " Activities These are common in many classes and provide students with the opportunity to share a bit about who they are through a visual arts or writing process . <p> The Identity Tree family and friends make up the roots , interests and strengths make up the trunk and character strengths/virtues make up the leaves <p> Presentation each student creates a slide/poster that includes important images and words of strengths and interests . <p> All About Me Book often used for students with special needs but is something that can be used for all students . - Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " Book Creator " app on the iPad . <p> Movies some of our students have used iMovie to share a bit about themselves to share with peers and educators in the school . <p> Word Clouds students love using wordle , tagxedo , etc to create word clouds that include their strengths and interests . <p> Class Survey use a paper survey , a google form , or other online surveys ( with permission ) to ask questions about strengths and interests in and out of school . - You can also survey family members to provide thoughts about the student . - This would be great to be included in a students file . <p> Shared Stories through prompts , students can share stories of themselves that reveal strengths . <p> " What makes your heart sing ?

Spend 2 minutes a day for 10 days straight having a natural conversation with a student . Find out what brings out the smile and move deeper in the following days . Other teachers I know have lunch ( or " tea " ) with one or two students each week engaging in natural dialogue . - Something as simple as spending quality time can have a lasting impact on a child and open up our eyes to their lives beyond school . <p> Identity Day Although this is generally done as a school-wide event , it can also be done within a class . - During Identity Day , students plan , prepare and share a presentation about themselves . - They can present on- a strength , an interest , their family , culture anything that represents who they are . - I have been involved in two school-wide Identity Days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better connect with each other on strengths and interests . - For a description of Identity Day , click here . For resources that can help you run an Identity Day click here . <p> Create Space for Strengths to be Revealed More and more teachers are providing time each week for students to explore and create in areas of strength and interest . - Ideas like 20% Time , Genius Hour , and Innovation Days provide opportunities for students to showcase and bring out their strengths . <p> Strengths Chats- For educators struggling to find the strengths in one or two students , Kathy Cox has developed a strengths grid that can be used to frame individual conversations with students ( called " strengths chats " ) . - She has divided strengths into social , academic , athletic , artistic , cultural/spiritual , and mechanical . You can view the strengths grid in her article here . <p> Observe Take the time to watch and listen to your students . Ask the right questions . Instead of asking " how was your weekend ? " , ask " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Dora and ask " what was your favourite part ? " : - ) . - Create space in the lessons for students to share stories that reveal skills , traits , and virtues . You can also ask family members and friends to share what they feel a students strengths are . - In elementary , watch a child during choice times and recess . <p> Ask Adults If you are struggling to see the strengths within a student , check with a former teacher , coach , family member who has observed the student in his/her element doing something that helped them to flourish in that moment . If a student had success with a former teacher , tap into this ! <p> For the vast majority of our students , it is not difficult to create the conditions for strengths to be revealed . - The challenge is often to create ways for these student strengths to be used more often within the school . For some ideas to get you started on including the strengths of students , click here . For some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges and they often hesitate to open up to let us in. - For students with years of struggle , the fact that they come to school most days can show a real strength in resiliency , determination , or courage so this can be a starting point to embracing character strengths . <p> Some may be overwhelmed with the thought of trying to determine the strengths of ALL student ( some high school teachers teach 200+ students during the week ) ; my recommendation is to start with one student use some of the aforementioned strategies to determine the strengths of one child and build from there . - The role of the principal is critical as well as they too must be involved in modeling and looking through the strength-based lens to impact school culture beyond the classrooms . <p> I realize many teachers already do some or many of these ideas and some do much more . I would love to hear and learn more how do you determine the strengths of your students ? 
@@58740509 @7740509/ <h> Language has Power <p> So I had two experiences this past week that made me really think about how much power there is in the language that we use with others . These experiences have made me reflect deeply on how I have been using language with my students and my colleagues , and how often the language that I use , and how I use it , actually inspires another person to feel better about themselves or their day . Our language , both body and verbal , is the single most important tool that we have which can affect another person 's mood , the mindset of a classroom full of students , a relationship with a friend , a kid , or a colleague , and the overall culture of a school . Using positive and direct language is the key to developing strong and lasting relationships in my opinion , and the key to how we feel about ourselves deep down as individuals and as leaders . The language that we use shapes who we are , as well as the impact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , and courage to think before we speak , and to ensure that what comes out of our mouths is actually going to be received in the way that we intended it . Words have the power to crush a person 's spirit or to inspire them to be the best that they can be . Words can change a person 's day instantly for the better or for the worse , and in many cases we do n't even give our language a second thought . We often say things that have a profound impact on another person 's mood or day or self-esteem and we do n't even realize it and that just is n't good enough . <p> The first experience happened late last week , and it came from one of my teacher leaders in the Middle School . She gave me a compliment just when I needed it the most , and I 'm sure that she had no idea how important those words were to me at that time . You see , I was having a tough day , dealing with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood , and gave me the extra boost of confidence that I needed to deal with these issues head on . I often joke that I can live on a single compliment for a month , but there 's some truth to that . We all need a boost once in a while , and I wonder how much conscious thought we give to recognizing verbally the positive contributions that others have on our lives . Words always cost a great deal even though they are free , and often times they cost more when they 're not said at all . When was the last time that you thanked a colleague , or a student , for changing your day for the better ? How often do you purposefully go out of your way to compliment , or to use positive language with every one of your students and colleaguesevery monthevery weekevery day ? Do you ever think about the body language that you 're using when you have your dozens and dozens of interactions with people each and every day at school ? Our language is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we take advantage of the power that it has as much as we should . <p> The second experience happened early last week with one of my Middle School kids . He made a mistake ( like we all do ) , and I came down on him pretty hard . My direct words had a profound impact on him I think , and after the initial jolt they allowed us to strengthen our relationship , and for him to gain a clear understanding of our high expectations as a school , and the importance of learning life lessons . Using direct language with kids , and colleagues , is so important to developing a strong school culture . Saying what you mean , and meaning what you say is the way to garner respect , and to have you viewed by others as a person of integrity . Often times we 're afraid to say what we really want to say , and we sugar coat or tip toe around the root of an issue . We often do n't have the courage to address a problem because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue worse and build resentment . Honestly , it 's all about HOW you say somethingdifficult conversations can be framed with positive intent , and in a way that does n't make it about the other person necessarilyjust about the issue itself . Having the courage to have these direct conversations is what leadership is all about in my opinion , and the only way that a school , and the relationships within a school can truly move forward for the better . If you choose your language carefully , then in most instances It 's okay to speak to kids like adultsthe can handle itand they will respond in a way that will impress you beyond your initial expectation . <p> I 'm asking you all this week to think about the language that you use , and how you use it . Does your language inspireare you saying what you need to say in a positive wayare you giving the compliments to the people who positively impact you as a personand are you using your language to develop strong and lasting relationships . Language has power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatand acted on it . Have a wonderful week everyone and remember to be great for our students and good to each other . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 2 Comments <p> A said : <p> I am a new school leader and just last week I was talking to someone who has been my moral support through my transition . She told me that I am the one who can determine the culture and climate in the building- it is my attitude and how I interact with people that determines how the school will respond .

@@58740512 @7740512/ <h> Searchlight Souls <p> So there is nothing more exciting to me in my life than the first day of a new school year . Watching the kids spill off of the buses with wide eyes and nervous energy- is an experience that never gets old , and one that fills me with so many deep- emotions . I literally can not wait to see the kids , and their- smiles , and to share in their joy as they wonder about- the year that lies ahead . The beginning of a new school year is such an opportunity , and- such a- clean slate for all kids , and every single one of our students comes filled with a little anxiety but a whole lot of hope as they enter into their new classrooms for the first time . The first day of school will set the tone for the year in many ways , and the responsibility that we have as educators to inspire our kids and to- give them the start that they have been dreaming about is immense . We 've all been working so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing the first units and lessons of the year , finalizing the last few facility jobs from the summer projects , and meeting in teams to go over the years expectations and initiatives . None of this however , comes close to the real work that needs to be done once the kids arrive on Tuesday morningthe work of building strong and lasting relationships , which- is the true- foundation for- any significant- learning experience . <p> I remember when I was doing my practice teaching all those years ago , my mentor teacher ( Mrs. Arbuckle ) - told me two things that have stuck with me throughout my career . Two things that have shaped who I have become as an educator , and two things that inspire me each morning as I walk through the school gates . The first thing , which she drilled into my head over and over again , was her belief- that the true measure of any educator- can be found in the relationships that they develop with their most difficult students . I watched intently- every day as she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single one of her kids , especially the ones who were the most challenging . She loved her students like they- were her own , and she went above and beyond to find out who they were as young peopletheir hopes , their dreams , their strengths and weaknesses , their passions , and how they best learn as individuals . It was amazing for me to learn that teaching is n't really about delivering a lesson or imparting knowledge to kids , it is about getting them to see the beauty and potential that lies within themselves , and getting them to- recognize that same beauty and potential in othersit is- only then she said when students can be truly open and ready to deeply learn . The first day of the year is when these relationships begin , so think hard about how you 'll greet and engage your kids when you see them for the first timespend the better part of your first- days and weeks developing the relationships in your room , as there is no better foundation to set to inspire learning . <p> The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me everyday both inside and outside of the school , is that the most important job of an educator ( and as a human being for that matter ) is to be a searchlight soul for others , especially kids . She described a searchlight soul as a person who finds ways each and every day to be a mentor , an advocate , a counselor , and a surrogate mother/father to every kid that they come across . A person who actively seeks out those kids who are struggling in some way , or sitting alone , or making bad decisions , or finding it difficult to engage with others , or the kids who do n't  do traditional school well and are unique in their approach to life . Not only is a searchlight soul teacher- a beacon for a struggling student , and someone who students can trust in even the most difficult situations , but a teacher who- purposely goes out of their way to be on the- look out for struggling kidsand not just their own . We - all get caught up in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very easy to forget to pay attention to what 's going on around us with our kids . Every second of every day kids struggle with their relationships with their peers , and with their self confidence and self esteem , and with their body image , and with how they put themselves out there for others . It is up to us as educators to be watching for this intently so our kids know that they are constantly being looked out for . I 'm asking us all this year to be searchlight souls for our kids , and - mentors/advocates who never take a break from looking to change a childs day for the better . <p> I love the beginning of a new school year , and I 'm ridiculously- excited about tomorrows new family orientation . Its a chance to meet our new kids and to inspire them with the knowledge that they are now a part of an amazing school community . Then comes Tuesday morning when they all arrive , and I am- so eager to pass out all of the hugs that I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an incredible day . Remember everyone , its all about relationshipswith our kids , with each other , and with everyone that we come across . We are all- the weather for those around us , and together we can make this the best year in the lives of our students . Have a fantastic start to the school year everyone , and remember to be searchlight souls for our kidsand good to each other ! 
@@58740515 @7740515/ <h> Rethinking school discipline <p> At the start of next school year I will be embarking on my first- assistant principalship . I have observed lots of current assistant principals and I have spoken with even more ; a big part of the assistant principals job is to handle discipline . <p> As a German teacher for 6 years , I recall only having to write up ( give a referral ) to 7 students . That 's not bad , a little more than 1 per year ! I also recognize that I had some really awesome students who ELECTED to take my class . No students were being forced to learn German from the crazy guy with blond hair who used fly swatters in class . <p> As my role changes next year , I have been doing a lot of thinking about how to handle discipline , as well as what my discipline philosophy is . As a classroom teacher I never wanted to write a student up unless it was absolutely necessary . I felt that if I wrote a student up I was " passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a stronger and more positive relationship with that student . <p> On the other hand , I know some teachers who do n't  hesitate to write a student up because they feel it is the principals job to handle discipline issues , not the teachers job . Then there are those teachers who want the " book " both literally and figuratively thrown at some students , and if the book does n't  work they want the " hammer " dropped with- King Leonidas from the- movie 300 type force . <p> Now , I know there are certain circumstances and situations where the book and hammer need to be deployed , but how many times do we see the same students over and over getting the same kind of discipline repeatedly ? - If the discipline consequences did n't  work and were ineffective the first 3 times then it might work the 4th time right , I think not ! Treating students and school discipline as " black and white " scenarios just do n't  seem to be working <p> If a student skips school we- probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a student is late to class or unprepared we- probably shouldnt put the kid in in-school-suspension for 3 days . I know these scenarios seem funny , but they are happening ALL THE TIME in our schools . <p> Too often I think our discipline policies are reactive , rather than putting structures and steps in place to be proactive . Additionally , I find there needs to be a healthy balance of teacher/administrator collaboration on ways to address discipline in an educational setting . I also think we are working in isolation too often , when in fact we need to be working together to help out some of our most needy students. - EVERYBODY IS ON THE SAME TEAM ! <p> Yesterday I read this great article titled , " More schools rethinking zero-tolerance discipline stand , " which led me to writing this post . Perhaps I am being naive and I do n't  fully understand what it means to be a disciplinarian , but there is a tiny part of me who thinks- we might be missing a great opportunity to help those students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways we address discipline . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 23 Comments <p> charles ford said : <p> I do n't  think you are naive I believe you are inspired and you must keep that open mind throughout your time as an assistant pricipal . I like the way you think that discipline is an opportunity to get to know students and work as a team to improve behavior . Just always remember to make decisions in the best interest of the students and sometimes adults may not agree with you . If you stick to your convictions you will be an excellent assistant principal and make many lasting bonds with your students . Sometimes students need someone in their corner . <p> Thank you for taking time to comment . I appreciate your kind words of encouragement . Your point about making strong and enduring relationships with students is key , and it is my goal to reach out and make as many connections as possible with as many students I can . <p> I am a superintendent in New Jersey and I think it is great when i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your years of experience .

Your tweets and blog posts are always very inspiring and motivating , and I look forward to continuing my learning from you . I appreciate you taking the time to comment . <p> Thank you George for all your support and encouragement . You have been and are a huge influence on me as an Educator . Thank you for all you do and thanks for being an inspiration for Educators all around the world . <p> I have been thinking about this topics recently as well . I saw a presentation by Dr. Ross Greene at the Massachusetts Elementary School Principal Assoc. conference ( MESPA ) in May . He discussed Collaborative Problem Solving for our behaviorally challenged students . His main point was that students want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students skills ( emotional , social , academic , etc. ) do not match the behaviors that they are being asked to display at a particular moment . As such punishment on its own for the recurring visitor to your office is not going to solve the problem . The punishment does not help the student obtain the skills they need to respond appropriately next time they face similar expectations . Dr. Greenes site Lives in the Balance ( http : **28;438;TOOLONG ) discusses the approach and provides some useful documents . Dr. Greene also hosts weekly online call-in radio shows that applies the approach to problems callers bring to the show . There is a program for educators , and one for parents . <p> Ultimately I think that one needs to approach discipline as a learning opportunity . That is the business we are in , finding the learning opportunity in all that our students do . <p> Thank you for the comment . I have heard of the great work by Dr. Ross Greene from several people over the last couple of days . I will definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love your point about students acting out when their emotional , social , and academical needs are not being met . If we can develop and implement strategies and programs to make sure these basic but important needs are met , we will be much more productive when it comes to " really helping our students . " <p> Hi , thanks for your article . I was thinking that the scenario you described of the revolving door and doing the same things over and over but expecting different results is pretty much the case at our school . However , what do you think of having more of a structured set of school wide procedures that spell out what is office referral worthy and what is classroom territory off-task behaviors ? Also with that school wide procedure , adding you take requests for discpline support if teachers need it ? Those are 2 things that I think would be really helpful . It gets so difficulty because if you 're not careful , it becomes teachers against admin. and that does n't  help anyone . I know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert on my campus , any problem i have , I can call her in , she can quickly observe , give me on the spot modeling and feedback and then she leaves and I 'm able to practice and shell drop back in and coach me. it only takes her about 5 min. per visit and I find I am really successful with her feedback/coaching ; /modeling approach but really unsuccessful without it . <p> in continuation of my previous post , her help is not limited to me alone . the principals also send kids to her as a last resort or to deflate situations , as well as many subs and other teachers . I think its so vital to have concrete aspects like this to the whole team work ethic . <p> I totally have to agree with you Justin , and I 've been there and am still there in terms of administraotr as the heavy-handed disciplinarian . I think it will be most valuable to put your beliefs right out there to your staff as you take on your new role . Be an educator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and the thoughts of many of us . <p> two questions to always ask : what is the goal of the misbehavior ? and what is the goal of the redirection ? ( punishment ) one of our most effective discipline consequences is Saturday school . it is from 8 12 on Sat morning and takes the place of a 3 day ISS placement . many parents choose this because it keeps their child in class and they get to play a role in the discipline . also , I have found that sometimes there is a 3rd reason for an office referral ( the first two are " I want you to handle my discipline " and " throw the book at them " ) . Sometimes the rest of the class needs a break . One kids issues may be more than they can handle and it can be amazing how much they can accomplish with one less personality in the room . At our school we take " interfering with the learning of others " very seriously . good luck and always fight the 80/20 rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time , if you let it . " <p> I really like your 80/20 rule , I have never heard that before ! That is definitely the truth . I also like the fact that you allow parents a role in the discipline . Great idea and I think this would be a positive approach towards prevention in the future . As you , I take interfering with the learning of others very seriously as well . As administrators , we must provide a climate in which teachers can teach and students can learn . <p> I sometimes wonder if teachers really know how to handle discipline issues . That 's definitely true for me ! In my first few years in the classroom , I did " pass the buck " because I did n't  know what else to do . <p> What helped me become more effective in the classroom were the " debriefs " I would have with colleagues I trusted and respected . Their examples and advice have been helpful to me . Maybe all discipline issues ought to have two parts : <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . 2 . Debrief with the teacher and plan for next time . <p> I do n't  want student referrals or disciplinary notes to vanish into the ether . If its important enough for me to write a disciplinary note , I want to know the outcome and what I could have done differently . Ultimately , I want the students behavior or attitude to change for the betteror to address a problem before it becomes a habit . <p> I also wanted to know that my assistant principal and the principal were open to mentoring me . Its funny how that does n't  always come up in conversation . Sometimes I do n't  want a " solver " to fix my problems for me . I just need a sounding board to give me some perspective or to challenge my assumptions . <p> I appreciate you taking the time comment . Your insights were well thought out and very well presented . I think the most important part of your comment was the connection between administrators and teachers ; they must be willing to work together to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also means that administrators and teachers need to understand each others roles better because then and only then will both parties be able to work together effectively . <p> What a terrific philosophy . This type of perspective will allow you to build strong relationships with your students . I encourage you to share your philosophy immediately with your faculty because as you stated , your best teachers will send a student to the office wanting prevention while the poor teacher will expect revenge and will want them to leave the office mad Todd Whitaker . I have a very similar philosophy and students know that I listen and care about their side of the story . As a result , many times they will blame the teacher every time . And some times they make a great point and the teacher must be addressed . However , I work very hard to get them to focus on only their actions and to find a solution . I am a middle school principal and what also works very effectively is that I call parents everytime a student enters my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to make . Students know that if they are sent to my office , regardless of how minor , mom/dad/ or guardian will be called . I would want to know if my child was sent to the principals office . I also agree that suspension must be the last resort . We need our students in school . We are ultimately responsible for their learning ! Thanks for your post and good luck ! <p> I definitely agree that parents need to be involved as often as possible . I also agree that we need to truly research each referral before determining an appropriate response . Your point about having the student focus on his/her actions is also a great point . I will definitely keep this blog post readily available once I start dealing with discipline referrals . So many great comment and points ! <p> What about the student who continues to harass and bully other students on many settings over a period of years ? The classroom interventions are not working and the suspensions do not work either . Does n't  a classroom teacher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and report it to the assistant principal ? 
@@58740517 @7740517/ <p> I often hear other principals mention that they struggle with getting parents more involved in the school . A couple of weeks ago , I was asked how I might tackle this . After much thought and research and a meal or two , I have boiled down my solution for this long-standing struggle . <p> Ive come up with a three ( OK , four ) part plan for increasing parental- involvement- in schools . Inform , Invite , Perform , and FEED ! <p> Inform For many , this is the easiest part of the plan . Put out tons of- information in several different formats . The time honored newsletter is a great way to start . Most parents will appreciate an email newsletter with tons of information about the school . Remember to create a predictable publication schedule and stick to it ; I 've had emails from parents asking about my newsletter when it was only a few hours late . Most important for a school newsletter would be to include many voices . Although the principal might have an interesting things to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really grab the parents attention . Put the staff on a publication schedule and insist on it . <p> With the advent of Web 2.0 , stopping at a one-way newsletter is just so 20th Century . Start a blog about the school . Create a school Facebook page . Send out Tweets throughout the day to your parents . <p> Finally , use every opportunity in front of parents to communication a piece of your message . The Band Director allowed me to grab the microphone while the Jazz Band was setting up . I took the chance to speak about some of the work we were doing . <p> Do not be afraid to ask the teachers to participate via class newsletters , class websites or blogs , and more . <p> In short , give an overload of information about the school and their childs experience . Parents want to know . <p> Invite Most folks wo n't show up if they are not invited . So , invite them . Often . During the school year , I will photograph a really wonderful bulletin board or display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invite parents to come in to see it in person . <p> Of course , to invite someone you must have something to which to invite . In other words , create programs and experiences that include parents . Invite parents to assemblies ( if you have the room ) . Ask them to come in and volunteer in the library . Maybe parents will help out in the office . Parents can read , so get them in to class to be mystery/guest readers . Build a database of parent skills and then ask for help on a project . Ask parents to join a Site Council or Parent Advisory Board . Introduce new parents to the PTO president . Just ask . <p> Sort of like a baseball diamond in a corn field , ask them and they will come . <p> Perform Not so fast , I say . Sure , some parents will come- every time- they are asked . Its the other parents that we are trying to get involved . One sure fire way to have more parents attend school events is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring them in . How about an art show with student docents ? Talent show , recital night . Make some of these events part of the curriculum not extracurricular involve more parents . <p> But , performing is not just for the arts anymore .

Could a great lesson in front of 20 still be a great lesson in front of 40 ? Just throwing the question out there . I am not a teacher and have no research to quote . <p> Would be interesting to get @gregwhitby and @StephenH thoughts on this due to large space teaching/learning areas/classes in their schools . @darrenhowell <p> from Hattie 's research LONG ... where the impact of class size is listed in the of low influence ' group of influences on student achievement . I should mention that Hattie 's research also suggests differences between open and traditional learning spaces similarly have a low influence . This is at odds though with the 2012 research from the University of Salford , UK LONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive impact on learning . <p> This leads me to the real issue " class size is not the issue , nor is learning space by itself . The key issue for me is the notion of a class being one teacher working in isolation with around 30 students in a confined room with little ability to do much other than sit in formed rows or groups . That is the key issue . Could the learning experience itself be vastly improved in a model where a class was viewed as a far larger <p> cohort shared among multiple lead-learners ( teachers ) ? If this was the case , then designed space is an issue because it needs to facilitate this larger cohort . <p> Our experience at SCIL/NBCS is that when we can get teachers to engage in an unlearn-relearn journey and figure out how to work in a genuine shared team approach , then the experience of teaching and learning can change dramatically . No longer is it dependent on the pressures of a one teacher to 30 student scenario , rather students have multiple mentors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily basis . If the team can provide an environment where they collectively own all the students ( albeit they might have a smaller group for administrative oversight ) , then the whole issue of class size melts away . I 'd be confident to say that our Stage 3 Zone ' team are the most collaborative team that I have had the privilege of observing and supporting . I love the energy of the Zone and witnessing a combination of planned learning activities <p> and spontaneous just in time ' workshops to address obvious gaps in student understanding . Teachers have to surrender a great deal of their former practice ( control and individual space ) , but they gain so much more . Their role shifts to being collaborative co-directors of learning and student behavioural issues become something of the past . <p> So my response ? The issue is not class size or large space , rather how can we re-engineer learning so that the focus is on high expectations of students , formative evaluation , conversations , feedback , relationships " all the items listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . My experience is teaching me that working to develop the capacity of teachers to work in teams is the future . Debates on teacher / student ratios are increasingly irrelevant " and learning space design needs to follow pedagogy rather than dictate it .

@@58740519 @7740519/ <h> Middle School The Beautiful Struggle <p> So I 'm down to the last two weeks of being a Middle School Principal , and as it draws to an end I find myself getting really , really sadand feeling very , very grateful . Its been an amazing seven year run for me , across two very different schools and communities , in two different countries and in two different continents , and if I 'm being honest , its been the best seven years of my life so far . There 's something about the Middle School experience that is not for everyone . Its challenging in many ways , and it takes a special kind of educator who can find their passion dealing with this age group of kids , but you know what , its so immeasurably rewarding and it changes your life for the better . <p> If I think of all the grade levels in a traditional school environment as a burning flame , I see the Middle School years as that bright blue part right smack in the centerthe corethe place where it burns the hottest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place that transforms the overall identity of the fire . I like to call Middle School the beautiful struggle , because in many ways it is very much a struggle for kids , as they try to figure out life and their place in itbut with each struggle and with each stumble and eventually with each success , there is always incredible beauty ! <p> From the sweet innocence of the 6th grade class , who come to Middle School so excited , and scared , and hopeful , and nervous , and who still think it 's okay to go on playdates and to cry when they get hurt , to the confusing and formative 7th Grade class who learn so much about their changing bodies , and hormones , and how to fit in and make friends , and about who they are starting to become as people , to the desperate to be adult 8th grade class who want so much to be given independence and autonomy , but still silently scream out for boundaries and guidancehow can you not love this beautiful struggle ? All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartache , and all the relentless hope , it truly makes my heart want to burst ! Their search for themselves is so wide open and honest and pure , and it draws me in day after day after dayand it makes me smile . <p> The best part of my day is watching them all come off of the buses first thing in the morning ready to start again . They walk past me smiling , sleepy , and eager to learn about life , hoping to be noticed and inspired and validated by the ones who matter the mosttheir peers . I watch them , I joke with them , I try and set a good example for them , and I love themI have grown to understand their struggle . If you ask anyone about their Middle School years you always get a passionate response . Some people loved Middle School and some people hated it , but everyone remembers it intensely . That first crush , the hopeful first kiss , all those risks that were taken that either fell flat or successfully catapulted you ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you wish you had n't doneMiddle School changes you , and it sets the tone for the rest of your life . <p> For some people these are the best years of their lives and for some these are the worst , and for me it 's beautiful to watch it all unfold . I love Middle School and I love Middle School kids , and I 'm inviting you all this week to go out of your way to watch them , and to marvel at them , and to be inspired by what they 're going through . We need to praise them , and set high expectations for them , and embrace those daily ( hourly ) teachable moments , and we need to hold them accountable . We need to encourage them to take risks and to make mistakes and when they do , we need to take the time to watch them learn and learn and grow and grow . <p> Being a Middle School Principal has been one of the most inspiring experiences of my life because I got to live vicariously through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes from being right at the center of the flameeveryday .

With this will come a very different kind of beauty , and days filled with constant joy , innocence , and belly laughs before the school day even begins . I 'm absolutely thrilled to be going down this road , as I 've felt the pull down to the lower grades for a few years nowits honestly where I now want to be .

@@58740522 @7740522/ <h> Cutting Through The Fog of Student Achievement <p> I recently had the opportunity to spend two days working with - and listening to John Hattie and his team at- Visible Learning- unpacking his research on what has the greatest impact on student achievement . <p> Hattie 's research on " Visible Learning " has garnered world wide recognition and- is being referenced as a vehicle for cutting through the fog of school improvement . <p> Before going any further , Hattie himself made a point of highlighting some of the " limitations " of his research . For example , Hattie 's work strictly deals with student achievement in the academic domain . - His research does not deal with student well-being in the affective domain ( social and emotional learning ) . Nor does it address the spiritual domain of student well-being . - Any educator , school or district looking to implement Hattie 's work needs to understand the potential " limiting " context of this work . <p> - So what DOES " work " in improving student achievement ? <p> According to Hattie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of positive impact on achievement. - In other words almost everything " works " . <p> Hattie suggests that we should n't ask what " works " in improving achievement but rather- what is most effective- in improving achievement . <p> The following are some of teacher interventions that have the greatest impact : <p> Feedback <p> According to Hattie : " feedback works when a culture of error and mistakes are welcome . " Feedback to students is most effective when the learning is appropriately challenging and raises expectations . <p> Feedback can have both a positive and negative impact on achievement . The best and most effective feedback needs to be " just in time , just for me and delivered when and where it can do most good " and must come from both teacher and student . <p> During the workshop , we were given an opportunity to " give feedback " and to examine different types of feedback . My general observations is that as the person giving feedback you need to have a certain degree of expertise in the topic you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the material for the feedback to be helpful . Also , " task " orientated feedback is usually given when introducing new material . As the learner becomes more familiar the different levels of feedback given do not fall in a linear sequential pattern . The various types of feedback vary according to the situation . <p> The bottom line ? Giving varied feedback takes awareness and deliberate practice . We need to aware of the different types of feedback and more importantly , we need to equip ourselves and our students with capacity to effectively use the appropriate type of feedback for any given situation . Of course , quality feedback is rooted in level of trust in the relationship . <p> It should be noted that this concepts can also be applied to how we provide feedback to each other as professional educators ! <p> Meta Cognition <p> Meta-cognition is essentially the skill of thinking about thinking. - The research reveals that learners that can take control of learning and self regulate themselves improves achievement . <p> Teachers need to deploy both cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventions are related to the learning process that enable learners to make progress . Meta cognitive interventions are related to the self management of learning skills enabling learners to control progress <p> At the heart of this " impact " is the idea that teachers ( and students ) need to model meta cognitive strategies in their own learning . It is also clear that meta cognitive strategies can be taught and can be applied across learning areas . <p> In needs to be noted that these meta-cognitive strategies are not taught as an " add on " but rather within related content/subject areas . <p> The following is a link to how- meta-cognition- can be used in an elementary school language arts class . <p> Teacher as Evaluator : Capturing Student Voice <p> An important teacher " mindframe " that Hattie identifies is " teacher as evaluator " . <p> - Teachers must be primary concerned with understanding their impact on student learning on a daily basis . - A teacher needs to answer : How am I doing ? Where to next ? - How am I going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of their impact , - a teacher must capture authentic student voice . <p> - It was fascinating to observe examples of - how school communities went through the process of creating a common language around learning , teaching and feedback a worthwhile and powerful process for sure ! <p> Assessment Capable Learners &amp; Teacher Expectations <p> The research reveals that students are very good at predicting their achievement level which affirms the use of self assessments in the classroom . Furthermore students in classes where teachers raise expectations , beyond what the students believe they can do , and viagra sales provide necessary supports to reach those expectations , do better . <p> The bottom line is that in any given class , students ( &amp; teachers ) should be able to answer " where am I going ? How am I doing ? Where to cialis canada next ? <p> Collective teacher efficacy <p> Student achievement improves when when teachers work together to make each other better . From planning for instruction and assessment - to teachers should NOT be working alone <p> Learning Criteria &amp; Teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria improves student achievement . - Achievement improves when students are clear of the learning intentions and success criteria . ( Learning intentions are the learning goals of the lesson . Success criteria are related to the what the learner must demonstrated at the end of the lesson. ) - The clearer and transparent the learning intentions and success criteria , the greater the achievement . In the same way , the use of " exemplars " are extremely effective in this capacity . <p> Response to Intervention <p> This is a model of instruction where specific and varied interventions by teachers have a positive impact on student achievement . Watch this- video- - for a quick reference to RTI <p> Teacher Knowing Student prior knowledge <p> The research reveals that 60-70% of what teachers teach the students already know . Teachers must be very diligent in getting an accurate read of students prior knowledge or they run the risk of disengaging most of their students . <p> Other Interesting Revelations : <p> Homework <p> The research reveals that homework has little positive impact on achievement at the elementary level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the high school level . - When combined , homework does have some benefit in improving achievement but not a significant one . <p> Leadership <p> The overall effect of school leadership on achievement , is not huge . - Further exploration reveals that leaders who mostly focus their energies towards being- instructional leaders- does have a positive impact on achievement . <p> Class Size : <p> The research reveals the class size is not a significant indicator of student achievement . - This topic elicited some conversation and questioning . - On a personal level , I believe that effective teachers are those that can establish strong relationships with their students . - It is far more challenging to establish relationships and respond to the individual needs of your students in a class of 35 than a class of 25 . <p> The salient point of the research , however , - is that- teachers in smaller classes DID NOT change- their- teaching practices - to reflect the smaller sizes ! - Teachers in classes of 20 taught the same as when they had classes of 35 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend time exploring how boys learn different from girls are spending time answering the wrong question ! - The research reveals that difference in achievement levels is minimal and not worth the energy . <p> - Learning Styles <p> Hattie was clear on this topic . Teaching to different - learning styles is " nonsense " . - There is no evidence to support that it increases achievement . <p> Problem Based Learning <p> Problem based learning has a positive effect on student achievement provided students have a have a solid base of subject knowledge <p> Technology <p> Technology itself does not improve achievement . - Technology used to enhance meta-cognition , feedback , - problem solve and think critically has greater capacity to improve achievement . - In other words , technology needs to be seen as more than a tool for accessing information ( the 21st century textbook ) <p> Implications Moving forward : <p> - A couple of quotes that resonate with me : <p> Visible learning and teaching occurs when teachers see learning through the eyes of students and when teachers help student become their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch teachers teach , but rather watch students learning , - through- the eyes of students <p> - As I continue to absorb Hattie 's work and it 's implications for our school system , I am left thinking about how this research can inform our school , teacher and principal growth planning/ evaluation systems . <p> I recently had the opportunity to spend two days working with and listening to John Hattie and his team at Visible Learning unpacking his research on what has the greatest impact on student achievement .

170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 15 Comments <p> Jonathan , first off , I am amazed that your school can pull this off and that you can stand at the back of the room and watch kids " goofing off " on facebook etc . <p> Lecturing is a skill that I hope never completely diappears , because oral language is so powerful in learning , especially with a master storyteller . <p> The most important point you mentioned was that when the kids were asked to engage in a discussion , their first move was to find more information and connections to the discussion . These are kids that know how to learn ! <p> I hope to hear more about these successes as we begin to have them . I hope someday I can struggle to finish such a fantastic post about true learning . <p> Good for you NOT blocking those sites Jonathan . As educators , we need to give out respect to our students , in the way we want it returned . We need to teach our students that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which CAN happen during the school day ) and that moderate use of anything is fine . Once we start realizing that this is part of our world and working with students to guide them through , our kids will be better off . <p> I have watched the screens at our schools and our kids are doing amazing things , The best part is that my amazement is lessening because the engagement and output is continuously good . When it becomes the norm , that is when you have achieved success . <p> Although I do n't  work at a school that is 1:1 , like yourself , I work in a district that has chosen not to block social media sites . This does pose challenges for all of us . Teachers face the challenge of students being distracted by Facebook , etc. either on their phones or laptops . As you eluded to however , when students are highly engaged in their learning the technology no longer becomes a distraction . Rather , the technology becomes a tool that facilitates learning . As a vice-principal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations where a student has chosen to use his/her smartphone inappropriately . As much as it can be frustrating to work through these situations and sometimes challenging to convince students of the importance of using the technology appropriately , I see these as learning opportunities for students . In fact , in some cases it proves to be a learning opportunity for me also , as students demonstrate to me how to navigate through certain sites in the process of sharing their story . Finally , in debriefing these situations with teachers it also allows me to share a perspective of where some of our students are with respect to their use of social media and just how powerful social networking can be for students and educators . In a previous post , I wrote about encouraging the use of social media , not banning it . I invite you to check it out . LONG ... <p> Much like yourself , I feel like some teachers may interpret what I say as a lack of support for them . I 'm not particularly comfortable knowing that feeling may be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals are conducting their work nowadays and I ponder how we as a society are going to solve some of the global challenges that lie ahead , I ask myself " Is it possible to accomplish all of this without being connected to one another through a network ? " And each time , I am left feeling more and more convinced that networking , both face-to-face and virtually , is becoming increasingly more important . <p> Is there an alternative ? Honestly , I do n't  think so . As people who recognize the value and importance of not blocking and filtering , I believe we have to support our teachers in the use and implementation of technology and social networking so that they too come to embrace the social revolution . <p> Score a point for 21st century learners ! Having been in a pen-based tablet PC classroom for the past three years teaching foundational math to first year college students , I agree . Our classroom is unique at my college , as the students also have the in-class use of pen-based tablet PCs . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to do math/science than with a tablet that has a stylus digital ink ! ) . We decided at the onset that the critical piece was to connect to students . We have software that allows us to share screens , go into online groups , answer polls , give a status report , search the internet , chat etc . Teachers load a note framework into the software , and students and teacher work together to develop a rich set of collaborative notes . Students can submit ( without others knowing ) a page to the teacher , just for a quick check over , to ensure they are doing it right , or teachers can ask all students to submit a page as part of an assessment . These can be viewed in class or returned at a later date . Each student stores their e-notes in a virtual binder that they can access from their home computer/laptop 24/7 . For students that are uncomfortable letting others know they do n't  understand , the level of participation is fantastic . Yes , students can get distracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be there , so we need to help students to learn how to stay on task when distraction is available . ( Besides they probably would have been doodling or day-dreaming in a pen and paper classroom ) . It is easy if using tablets , because if their pens are n't  moving , they are probably off on a tangent . These are adult learners though , so every 25 min or so we have a 2 min media break and they catch up with their peeps either by text or facebook I check into Twitter <p> I am a student at USA in Mobile , AL . I am in Dr. Stranges EDM310 Class and I am also a education major . I see the problems with computers in the classrooms and I also see the advantages . I know most students that bring there computers to the class rooms , in my college classes at least , are not using them for the education aspect . They are playing around on them . I do n't  know how I feel about having younger students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom . I learned just fine without them . But , on the other hand I know the world is forever changing and technology is on the rise . I quess I play both sides with the using computers in the classroom . Thank you for sharing ! <p> Congratulations on becoming a 1:1 school and providing the opportunity for teachers and students to accessing the internet . You articulated your vision for the school and have taken a huge step forward by not filtering gaming and social media sites . I 'm sure the students love coming to school . I also applaud you for not chastening students who were " parallel processing . " Excellent post ! <p> I 'm a student assistant for DML Central at the University of California Humanities Research Institute . We here explore how we can take digital media and use it positively in many aspects , most importantly education . So its exciting to see how technology and social media can go hand in hand with education . I understand that it can be difficult to allow students be free to use these social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school work . But , I agree that by not filtering those sites and stressing the importance of technological use over traditional lectures CAN guide these students to become more immersed in their learning . Theyll feel less restricted in their learning , thus it becoming their encouragement to learn and explore . <p> Jonathan- What an awesome post ! It is very interesting how you were able to " observe " ( via the students chosen activity on their laptops ) how engaging and relevant the lecture was to the them . Do n't  we , as adults , do the same thing ? Tune in and out doodle ? even grade papers during meetings when we feel things are n't  relevant to us ? It really is n't about technology . <p> I also love the " parallel processing " part . I could n't imagine NOT being able to use the internet while I am at a conference . Its how I learn I want to find out more , dig deeper , figure out how to make connections and SHARE ( via Twitter ) . These additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your students have figured out how to do this- its a necessary skill ! <p> Thank you for a very thoughtful and excellent post ! As a middle school principal of a school where we also do not block sites and where we are moving towards 1-1 , I found great food for thought in your comments . I believe educators and the public need to take a step back before they react to the " dangers and concerns " regarding students being able to distract themselves and engage easily in off-task behaviors that might involve visiting sites not appropriate for school or in cyber-bullying , etc . <p> To say " we learned just fine without them " is akin to someone saying they learned just fine in a one room school house or by sitting at the feet of Socrates . Yes , students have learned in the past through various methods and structures . We have to continually ask ourselves , " What is it our students NEED to learn and how will our students learn best ? " And in all honesty , educators must realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( teacher , administrator , parent , school board member ) is comfortable with or what our opinions and feelings are is missing the point and I believe is one of the things holding our education systems back . Unless our opinions and feelings are grounded in something more than our personal experiences ; unless we have carefully considered based on what we know to be evident in the world as it is today what competencies , skills , and habits of mind all of our students must develop in order to have opportunities for successful and satisfying lives what we " feel " is irrelevant to the discussion . <p> That leads me to your final comments about supporting teachers I am a teacher at heart , even in my current role as a principal ; I also struggle with the concept of " supporting " teachers . As unpolished and overly-direct as it may be , I truly am more concerned with supporting learning . The conversations I want to have with teachers are about the learning going on in their classrooms . I know this is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , " So tell me what you wanted your students to learn from what I observed ? " Having spent many years in the classroom teaching , I do not understand the negative reactions to that question . I think it is what every teacher should ask themselves as they plan and implement their lessons ; I think that is the question groups of teachers should be exploring together ( followed by several more questions such as " WHY ? " ; " Did they learn what was intended how do we know ? " ) . <p> From standing in the back of the classrooms with and without technology , I think your approach is " spot on . " <p> I sat at the back of the recent Apple Leadership Summit ( Singapore ) and witnessed a similar scene not with students , but with educators . Twenty years ago , an acceptable " distraction " was a smoke break . Surely a Facebook " distraction " is much healthier . <p> 10:42 pm in Pedagogy by Paul Left Jonathan Martin is the principal of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of Connected Principals he reports on his experience with observing students at work by Standing in the Back , Watching the Screens . <p> I agree that laptops are incredible and powerful learning tools and I also agree that filtering should be minimal . The benefits of social media and many other websites far outweigh the potential dangers and in a properly monitored classroom , indiscriminate surfing should n't be an issue . If it is an issue , it probably has more to do with classroom management issues that a need for more filtering . <p> That said , I think your call for teachers not to lecture so much needs to be clarified . The word lecture has negative connotations when in fact , my educational background was filled with many interesting people and lectures . Teachers are often very interesting , well-traveled and highly educated people . They are elders in the society and to continually marginalize them , as they often are in the media , as out of touch lecturers who thrive on making kids bored is wrong . Teachers are state-contracted employees and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are supposedly their supervisors . <p> If teachers want their students to put their laptops down , focus and listen to an actual human being speak of actual human experience , they have a right to do so without it being labled " sad " because of some personal quasi sociological pet terminology like " parallel learning " ( or whatever you called it ) being compromised . Also , though some of the ideas in your article are good , it is very poorly written and it just goes to show that the internet is filled with all kinds of poorly edited garbage . Lots of poorly constructed sentences and misplaced or extraneous adverbs . You should have had one of your " excellent , very very good " teachers edit this before posting it online . 
@@58740525 @7740525/ <h> Blogging vs Threaded Discussions in Online Courses <p> Proponents of social learning theory believe that learning is based upon an individuals overall environment . What one observes and experiences has a profound impact on how one makes meaning of information . Learners process information based upon <p> their shared experiences with others , entering into a phase of learning that includes : attention ; retention ; reproduction ; and ultimately the motivation to alter behavior . <p> In short , social learning purports ones community and environment are vital to ones learning . <p> But how does this apply within online courses ? How can students learn from others within a virtual environment ? <p> Instructors of online courses must create a learning environment that differentiates student discussion . But specifically , teachers must incorporate use of student blogging in an online course structure . <p> Clarke and Kinne ( 2012 ) conducted a study that followed two forms of asynchronous discussion amongst students1. ) through use of threaded discussions in a message board and 2. ) by blog posts and responses . According to their findings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by engaging in discourse through blogging . <p> According to their research , students who blogged about coursework and posted responses to classmates , developed a strong sense of community amongst each other . Because the form of blog writing tends to be less " academic " and more personal , students linked their meaning of academic material to their own lives and experiences . This resulted in more candid and personal discourse amongst the class . While students maintained attention to the various academic topics of study , they did so with their own voice . Students " felt more listed to and valued in their posts than students using discussion boards " ( p. 11 ) . Ultimately , this led to the indirect formation of a community of practice , of which students connected their learning experiences to the shared experiences of others . <p> This was in sharp contrast to the experiences of students that engaged in discourse through threaded discussions via Blackboard learning management system . Students tended to collaborate with peers in a very " academic , " less personal tone . <p> Nystrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 ) indicate that threaded discussion board conversations tend to mimics the delivery of traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms , in which the teacher is the gatekeeper of knowledge and students occasionally participate . Learning is less social , and therefore , less personal and motivating . <p> Clarke and Kinnes research indicates that threaded discussions are missing the element of community amongst its participants , resulting in decreased perception of engagement and empowerment . <p> Rovai ( 2007 ) asserts the goal of online courses should be to create a learning environment that fully motivates and empowers learners to be active in their learning , exchange positive communication with others , and feel engaged/moved by the course . This is how learning becomes social and truly motivating . <p> For instructors of online courses , this does n't  mean forever-abandon the use of threaded discussions . Not at all . They have their place . But , this research provides more justification of how instructors can create the conditions that result in the development of a community of practice . This community leads to social learning and student motivation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seems to affirm what I experienced last summer . <p> Because there werent enough students to teach my regular local college course , I was asked to supervise two education students in an independent study experience . Usually I teach the same childrens literature class using a hybrid method partly face-to-face and partly online . We have always used threaded discussions , visible to only us , but this year I did not want the three of us to attempt a meaningful discussion . I asked and received some serious backup from members of my PLN when we discussed on a blog . Here is just one of the posts that some of my PLN friends and I used to welcome my students to an online public learning LONG ... It was a great experience ! <p> Its not clear that Clark and Kinne looked at differences in facilitation techniques of the teachers in their study ; I suspect they did not . Had they considered variations in teacher facilitation of the discussions , I think there would have been in even more to report . My experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the discussion has less to do with the quality and depth of the discussion than the nature and frequency of teacher/instructor facilitation . The setup , directions , communicated expectations are also critical to the qualtiy of a discussion . <p> I do n't  think we can say from what we have , so far , that " research says that blogs are better than threaded discussions . " They 're two different tools with different characteristics ; either can lead to quality learning when used by a good teacher . <p> I agree with Dan that blogs and threaded discussions are two different tools . Its like saying a Crescent wrench is better than channel-lock pliers . Both can be used in a similar way , but there are times when one is a better tool than another . That 's why I keep both in my garage . Other research shows that threaded discussions do promote community , as well . My suggestion : Let 's determine the attributes of each tool and fit the tools to the context at hand . Both tools , in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students we serve . <p> I totally believe that two tools that support online communications can not be debated over.Each tool has characteristics that help in better collaboration in online learning communities.The blog is a place where the writer can present his views clearly and share the knowledge he posses well.Discussion forum is also a source of knowledge which has been built with the contributions of different students who interacted and collaborated with each other over a topic.These two will give best results for collaboration when used effectively.A blog is a knowledge source which provides knowledge shared by one person and knowledge is gained by many.It is one to many.The discussion forum on other hand is many to many.The ideas are shared by many and knowledge is gained by many.Hence I think these tools should not be compared with each other.Instead it should be seen how effective these tools are in a given scenario . <p> Interesting points Chaitanya and Dan on how the two tools should not be compared and each have their own use and are suitable for specific purposes . However I feel both serve the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge over discussion forums in that they give a detailed view of the bloggers understanding and others discussion based on that . Each can give their own understanding in their blogs for other students to give feedbacks . Blogs also help the blogger to learn as opposed to what Chaitanya told . The blogger can learn from the feedbacks and opinions given by his peers . There is more mutual learning in blogs than one usually think . <p> I agree with Dan here , because blogging and threading are entirely two different tools . <p> According to Schiano , et al . on his research on blogging and its benefits , weblogs or blogs can be described as a form of personal , easy " to " manage Web sites with content presented in reverse chronological order . Bloggers are also frequently described as influential agenda setters . It is similar to a newspaper article where readers can comment on it and discuss about it . <p> But threaded discussions on the other hand are similar to discussions online where people get together and build knowledge on a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally different applications which can not be compared on a common ground . So the quality of the learning depends on how a teacher can make use of them for different learning purposes . <p> I agree with Akshaya here . To a large extent , blogging and forum use correlated with specific individual learning styles and media affordances : the use of blogs was associated with the ability to create personal space for personal learning , quiet reflection and developing personal relationships with bloggers and others . The use of forums was associated with fast paced challenging interaction , relationships based on sharing of ideas , more open discussion and more links to the discussed themes and bigger picture . Threaded discussions have a lot to do more like debates , for an example . <p> Each have specific strengths and it is possible that the best of both could be combined into a very effective learning tool . The lifelong learning potential inherent in blogs makes them attractive to education professionals . If learners have an opportunity to experiment with blogging they can make a decision about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of blogging and adopt it as part of their learning landscape while others will be motivated to move on to others tools that are more in line with their learning styles . <p> " Proponents of social learning theory believe that learning is based upon an individual 's overall environment . What one observes and experiences Instructors of online courses must create a learning environment that differentiates student discussion " <p> I think the point is very well takennobody should abandon the use of threaded discussions . They have a purpose , and for the structure of some online courses , is one of the few asynchronous tools that can be used for student **27;468;TOOLONG with peers . <p> For me , the key takeaway from this study was the theme of " community " and " engagement . " According to the studys outcomes , students who relied solely on threaded discussion were only about 30-40% personally connected to the coursework and their peers , whereas 70-80% felt more so through the use of blog communication . <p> I also had some questions about the studys design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark , well-grounded study at this time , but is a start . Could be a great catalyst for other online instructors to conduct their own action research . <p> I need to read the original article about the study to learn more about how the research was conducted . The post indicates Blackboard was used for the threaded discussions . The technology used can influence results . Students tend to find Blackboard not " authentic " and a closed environment that they associate with academia , not with the way people outside of higher education communicate . We did not learn from the post what system was used for blogging . Although Blackboard does allow for some blogging , was it used for the blogging in this study ? If not , what tool was used ? What if Ning which allows for both blogging and forums ( threaded discussions ) was used ? Does the tool itself affect the results ? We also need to know about other variables that might have affected results . What were the external variables that the researchers could not control ? Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some answers . However , we also need to remember that in a study like this one , the tool and other variables can explain outcomes . That is the , two interventions alone might not fully explain the results . <p> Judy , from a research design perspectivevery fair arguments to raise about the studys methods . <p> At the practitioner-level , the awareness of student " engagement " and " community " is the key takeaway from this study . <p> Online instructors need to be aware of the environments in which their students will collaborate with peers . Action research and trial-and-error would be best for instructors to determine which yields the greatest ROI . <p> blog/portfolio can also help you- represent your accomplishments to a future employer . - Finally , - research - has shown that blogging helps students make course materials their own to a greater extent than <p> " Proponents of social learning theory believe that learning is based upon an individuals overall environment .

@@58740526 @7740526/ <p> If we administrators expect teachers to proactively respond to these big shifts for the futures of their students , mustnt we do so ourselves ? <p> Shouldnt we be transforming faculty meetings ( and other " PD " ) into faculty doings ? Shouldnt we be experimenting with PBL with adultsand with projects that are relevant and meaningful to teachers ? Are we even asking them what they want and need ? <p> From the admin view , how can we make school more " teacher-centered " so that teachers can , in turn , make school more student-centered ? Shouldnt we admin be modeling " student voice and choice " by providing such to our faculties ? <p> How are we un-silo-ing our schools to facilitate teachers working in teams ? <p> How are we facilitating the construction of meaning among our faculties , instead of asking them to consume information ? Do decisions feel top-down or bottom-up ? Or inside-out ? Or outside-in ? <p> How are we admin employing and engaging learning networks and advocating for OPEN and SAFE and THOUGHTFUL use of such endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are we crowd-sourcing our collective wisdom within our faculties and among our faculties from school to school ? How are we refusing to re-invent the wheel and instead partnering with the crowds of other doing schoolsI mean networks ? <p> How are we refusing the high stakes testing of teachers and engaging high value demonstrations of professional practice ? <p> A people strategy begins with EMPATHY . It moves along the stepping stones of the Golden Rule . A people strategy refuses to commit the fundamental attribution error ( see the Heath Bros Switch ) . <p> Be the change you want to see in others ! Show the way ; do n't  just tell the way . Blur the lines among " admin , " " teacher , " " student . " In fact , any of us should be all three . Its not about the titles . Its about learningtogether . <p> It would appear that just the word meeting sends a shiver of boredom , resentment , and poor time management , down the spine of the majority of todays busy teachers . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed solidity to those rickety vertebrae . <p> The Noun : If we use the word meeting in the form of a noun , which I would guess all schools do , then everyone has to attend . We are going to a meeting ! Its a little bit like going to a Rolling Stones concert , or the latest Dark Knight movie , but without the same buzz of excitement , special effects , or satisfaction of getting your moneys worth . We generally spectate ; take in some interesting bits , and forget most of it by the time we reach the car . In fact , many spectators at faculty meetings tend to sit with one eye on the clock ( as communication is spoon fed to them ) whilst their other eye observes the carefully crafted notes they are scrawling , into their notepad full of previous notes from previous meetings . Then there 's the classic single grade level tennis match You know the one , where admin take on two teachers whilst the rest watch for 40 minutes , and just as it gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should discuss this further , in a one on one setting ring out to bring the encounter to a close , with no victor or resolution . Surely that 's not the way busy educators want to spend Thursdays afternoons knowing that the only definitive outcome of the day is that they are all going to hit rush hour traffic . <p> The Verb : Now let 's use the term meeting as a verb : as in , We are going to meet ! " : as in a doing word ; as in a word of ACTION " ! Do quality teachers have a problem with a meeting , where they are a part of the process . It does n't  matter what time of day , or how long it goes on , if it is productive and the team are moving somewhere with it , then it is time well invested . It is often rewarding . It utilizes creativity and other problem solving skills . It brings teams together . Also , any meeting of that nature has nearly always required a write up , minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to someone who was not in attendance ( a member of admin , colleagues , parents etc . ) So what is the difference between that process and the audience centered meeting where only a handful of people are part of the interactive process ? For those who are not involved , can they not be e-mailed the notes and updates at a later time ? <p> This leads onto the difference between effective meetings and effective communication . If we get both right then staff morale and efficiency should soar . Is it effective to have a number of staff watching and listening to the to-ing and fro-ing of ideas , changes of mindset , and revisions of plans , when they could just be served the final decisions and outcomes in an email at a later date ? The response to that question may well be , What about the democratic system of decision making ? Effective democracy only works with people who are actively engaged , interested , and prepared to act . Therefore , those are the people who should be invited to the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but those who feel its not their thing , not their responsibility , or not their area of expertise , are welcome to leave the building and beat the traffic . This is where the concept of subcommittees seems to be an all round efficient solution ; with 6-10 committees within a faculty , there is plenty of opportunity for everyone to act , with passion , in an area they believe they can be most effective . <p> The upshot here is that if you are going to meet then good on you ; meet in style and get something done . If you are going to a meeting then prepare for a hatful of information , plenty of note taking , a serving of frustration , with maybe the added bonus of some end of day snacks , followed by a slow anxious commute home . <p> Its a difficult change in schema for those is the routine but seems very natural and intuitive for productive professional work . I have the following quote posted on my office wall to push all of us in the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee meeting merely to give my own ideas . If that were all , I might write my fellow members a letter . But neither do I go to learn other peoples ideas . If that were all , I might ask each to write me a letter . I go to a committee meeting in order that all together we may create a group idea , an idea that will be better than any of our ideas alone , moreover , which will be better than all of our ideas added together . For this group idea will not be produced by any process of addition , but by the interpenetration of us all . " Mary Parker Follett , The New State

As we begin to get to to the heart of the problem other issues may surface and the problem is a lot bigger than one initially envisaged . <p> Firefighting analogies have been used frequently when describing the challenges associated with tackling problems in schools . Some of the statements below got me thinking about how we tackle problems ( fires ) in our schools : <p> Tackle the real blaze not just the smaller spot fires .

The real problem is often the most difficult one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overcoming small blazes is important but they do not address the major problem , which burns on . <p> Prevent the fires before they start . Firefighting is reactionary in nature . So , many fires could have easily been prevented by good habits and practices in the first place . As leaders in schools , we have to build capacity in our staff and develop the necessary systems that limit the opportunity for problems to surface the the first place . <p> When tackling one fire make sure you are not allowing someone to go light fires elsewhere . As leaders we need to be aware of what is going on in our schools . This should not be confused with micromanagement . Being aware of what is going on , is about having oversight and ensuring that- there are regular opportunities for you to check-in with the members of your team , so you can be given updates on what is happening and , in particular progress being made and arising issues .

Many blazes in natural bushland are really complex and have many fronts , so it is important to get a good idea of what you are dealing with .

When this works well , it is awesome ; when it does n't  work well , it can be a disaster . - The opportunity is great , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well , the result will be better understanding and retention of key factual content and key- interpretations- , better anticipation of what will be on the test , and far more breadth of wisdom in how to answer those questions . <p> Here is my suggested strategy for group study : - gather 3-6 students , no more , together for a couple of hours : be clear up-front that this is serious study time . - - Have food available : this is very valuable ! Bagels and cream cheese ( not donuts or candy ) is my recommendation . - Spend thirty to fortyfive minutes- brainstorming what you think will be asked on the test : review previous tests , study guides , textbook unit tests , and any other materials to guide you . - You might have each member of the group individually write up 3-4 questions , and then share them with the group for discussion and feedback as you generate the best ( and what you think are most likely ) test questions you can identify . <p> Then , having established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend 90-120 minutes answering them . - You might talk about them , one at a time , taking turns having a group member be the note-taker , and talk as widely , deeply , and inclusively as you can about how to answer these questions . - - If you did n't  come up with good , challenging , and representative problems in the first round , this round might fall flat . - - Sometimes it works better to divvy the questions up , have each of you individually answer them in writing , then share the answers out loud for discussion and expansion . <p> The discussion benefits you two ways : as someone speaking and sharing your suggested answer , you yourself are gaining far more comprehension and retention of those ideas because the best way to deeply understand and remember ideas is to explain it to someone else . - - Second , by listening to others , you will get new ideas and perspectives to bring to bear on the question you might never have thought of , and by using this broader set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perform better than you would have alone ! <p> 3 . Exercise and sleep . This is common-sense and universally advised , but it bears repeating . - Exercise in particular is so valuable , and take the time to walk every 30-45 minutes around the block or up some stairs . - You might even try to do very light exercise , on a treadmill or exercise bike at low rates for instance , while you are studying . <p> 4. - Move around . When you are trying to learn , master , and memorize ideas or facts , do so while moving from spot to spot . - At each spot , focus on learning one idea/fact/topic , and do so while looking around and taking in your surroundings . - Do this inside or outside your house or anywhere you might be . - - If possible , repeat , returning to the same location for the same nugget. - - Our brains are more like those of squirrels or pigeons than we realize ; they are deeply wired to associate learnings with location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can return to them months later ; if we associate a physical location with an idea , it is imprinted in our brain , so that all we need to do is remember the location and the acorn buried there will return to mind in all its detail and specificity . <p> 5 . Connect smells to learning . This may seem bizarre , but as Proust taught us with the madeleine , memory and smell are deeply , powerfully intertwined . - - You might try sucking on a particularly flavored altoid mint while you study a difficult subject , and then , ( with the permission of your teacher ! ) , suck on that same flavor mint while you take your exam . - Medina , is his terrific book Brain Rules , tells us that- research has demonstrated this works . <p> One more tip , not about studying but exam-taking. - - When you encounter a question which entirely stymies you one you think you have no idea whatsoever how to answer- just begin writing . - Begin to fill that white space with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , and then free associate to anything at all you do remember about the topic at hand even if your ideas have no direct relationship to the question at hand . - - What you will find , more often than not , is that ideas are connected to other ideas ; ideas follow each other like a long train of widely varying units , and by beginning to write words and ideas you do know , the connected ones that you have forgotten begin to emerge in your mind and on the paper . - Just get the train of ideas moving , and what you are looking for will come along before too long . <p> Readers , please share other advice you might have on best study practices for our students as they anticipate exams . <p> Cross-posted on www.21k12blog.net 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 10 Comments <p> Jonathan , your post provides some great strategies for test prep . My question to you is : do you think that taking tests is the best way to assess our kids ? Do you think that students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for getting the fireworks in our minds going , why do adults not do this beyond school ? I know you are a fan of Wagner how does exam-taking fit into his ideas ? <p> I know you state that you enjoyed taking exams but I absolutely hated them . The best thing about my Masters Program was that I could demonstrate my learning through presentations , debates/discussions , papers , etc and not have to do a single quiz or exam . <p> I know your post is not about whether exams are effective for learning but it may open up a good conversation around this topic . <p> I also realize that we are often forced to give exams and part of our job is to help our students succeed within the system . <p> One thing I like about this site is it often challenges my thinking . I would love to hear peoples thoughts around this . <p> 1 . Yes , in a certain sense I was stipulating implicitly the status quo of examinations in offering this advice . I think education should change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my students ( and millions of others ) still need to take their exams next week and I might as well try to help them as best I can in the meantime . <p> 2 . I try to be a both/and , all things in moderation kind of guy . I am very passionate about PBL , exhibitions , published student work , digital portfolios , and think all these tools should be a much larger part of how we assess student learning . But I also think , as I say above , that a well designed test can be a valuable , intellectual , learning experience . I also think it can be a good way , not the only good way , to assess how well kids have learned to think about complex topics . <p> 4 . I was especially conflicted , in what I wrote above , about the " smell " discussion . I do n't  want students taking tests that reward students for their memorization skills , I want them to take tests that prioritize thinking skills . So the advice there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better tests , and I think that for the most part , better tests are open-book , and " open-Google " tests , where students have the skills to seek , find and use information to answer challenging , rich questions . I wrote about this recently here on CP when I wrote about " Open Info Access Testing . " <p> 5 . I think Tony Wagner is aligned with what I am saying here . I think he is appalled by tests which call for regurgitation or rote application of formulas . He has expressed great reservations about AP testing ; he has praised highly High Tech Highs PBL approach . But he , like me , endorses the CWRA and has praised both the PISA tests and the IB test philosophy , because they are much better constructed tests , tests which require students to demonstrate higher order thinking and problem-solving . <p> 6 . I am intrigued , and a bit stumped , by your question about why if exams are so great , why we as adults do n't  do them . Many adults do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of " tests , " perhaps . I think there are times when we as adults have a challenging assignment and a time limit , and have to sit down and figure it out and get it done , and some of us find we thrive in those moments . But those are only partial parallels . Interesting . <p> Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this . I know so many of us are conflicted about the importance placed on standardized testing and the undue stresses it can sometimes cause teachers and students . I continue to try to help my teachers see the value in using our state standards as a guide for bringing alive a world of interesting content and learning for our students without having them feel completely overwhelmed by the demands of a too-packed curriculum and high-stakes tests . When state testing time rolls around in the spring , a lot of schools hold testing pep rallies and make a big to-do about the assessments . We definitely do not . If we 've been working hard to help develop each student as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> Reading through your list , it seems as though your suggestions could be applied to improving learning outcomes for students at any time , not just at exam time ! <p> I agree with Chris that the current structure of high-stakes assessment is not the most effective way to evaluate our students learning . I 'd love to see my state experiment with varied types of assessments . Our reading , math , and science exams do ask students to craft writing responses to open-ended problems , but for the most part , students fall victim to the " bubbles " and are asked lower-level thinking questions . <p> I've- written before about effective group study among high school students ; it does have to be disciplined , and perhaps supervised at first , for the good practices to become internalized. - But among the things we need to be teaching kids , and ensuring they learn , is effective collaboration , and study is a great , real world , place to put this particular teaching and learning .

@@58740541 @7740541/ <h> You Are The Weather ! <p> So there 's this little girl that I know who might just be the happiest person that I have ever met . I fortunately get to see her every morning , and her contagious warmth , smile , and attitude brightens my mood without fail , and sets the tone for my day . She 's like the weather for me , and everyone around her , in that she changes the mood , the energy , and the outlook of anyone lucky enough to cross her path . Last Friday , when she arrived at school , I was busy dealing with an issue that had started my day in a less than ideal way , and my frame of mind was less than perfect to start my morning with students and faculty . She blew into my office like a warm breeze , dripping with sunshine and rainbows and it instantly snapped me back into the right frame of mind . Since that moment , I 've been thinking a lot about how we as educators are the weather for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every morning when we arrive on campus . We are either warm , sunny days or cold , cloudy ones , just waiting to influence and affect everyone else around us . The beautiful thing about this kind of weather however , is that we have a choice in what the forecast looks like , and an opportunity to make it anything we want . This little girl chooses to be sunny and warm because that 's her outlook on life , and even if it 's miserable outside , and she 's caught in a torrential downpour , I do n't think she has ever really had a rainy day in her life if you know what I mean . <p> It 's not hard to recognize how your attitude , or the attitude of the people around you , profoundly influences your life . Attitude is contagious , and it is the one thing that you have complete control over when you wake up in the morning . The decisions that you make to look at situations as a problems or as opportunities , and the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life into positives are what make you who you are for yourself , and maybe more importantly , who you are for the others around you . Think about the impact that you have on your students each and every day , and how a bad mood or a curt response can influence their opportunity to learnto feel safeto feel supportedto take risksand to internalize how adults deal and respond to difficult situations . We are teachers , and role models , and change agents for our students and our community , and the most important thing that we have to offer is not our content knowledge or our advanced degrees or our wonderful life experienceit 's our attitudes toward life and learning . So , what 's the forecast for your Monday morningor the upcoming weeksor the rest of the year ? Will you choose to be like this little girl ( who just happens to be my beautiful daughter Gabby ) , and be that perpetual warm sunny day , with blue skies and gentle breezesor are you going to something less inspiring ? Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our relationships with each other in very real and profound ways . <p> Oh yeah , here 's a trick that most of you already know . If you feel your mood deteriorating down to cloudy or rainy , or if you 're struggling in one way or another to keep that smile on your face and that spring in your step , take a few minutes and get out to the playground at recess or lunch and take a look around . It is impossible in my opinion to not be snapped back to sunny after seeing our beautiful kids running , and laughing , and playing . That 's a guaranteed way to adjust your attitude and be reminded of what 's really important in our lives . Their forecast is always like a gorgeous summer day , and it 'll rub off on you in a hurry . Remember everyone , and take this to heartyou are the weather for our community each and every dayso what 's that going to look like ? I choose sunny and warm !

@@58740555 @7740555/ <h> A vision of shared leadership <p> I am in the process of reading my second book as part of the #edfocus book club , which meets on Wednesdays at 8:30 CDT . The first book we read was " Focus " by Mike Schmoker , and we are currently reading " Leaders of Learning " by Richard DuFour and Robert Marzano . As you probably know , DuFour and Marzano are key players in the- Professional Learning Communities model , and as such this book ties a lot of its points to the implementation of PLCs at both the district , building and classroom levels . <p> I do n't  want to try to say it better than DuFour and Marzano so I am going to take a few statements from the book on " shared leadership , " and what building principals should look for when selecting team leaders : <p> 1 ) - Their influence with their colleagues The acceptance or rejection of an idea often depends less on the merits of the idea itself than on the person who is supporting it . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respected thattheir support helps convince others a proposal has merit . The people best suited to leading a team are these " opinion leaders . " <p> 2 ) - Their willingness to be a champion of the PLC process Organizations are most effective when leaders throughout the organization speak with one voice regarding priorities and align their own behaviors with those priorities . The most effective team leaders demonstrate their belief in the PLC process- by modeling their own commitment to a focus on learning , collaboration , collective inquiry , and results orientation . <p> 3 ) - Their sense of self-efficacy and willingness to persist A recent national survey of teachers revealed they believed the two most important factors for improving student achievement were more funding and better support from parents . This tendency to look for solutions outside ones own sphere of influence is a major barrier to improving schools. - Effective team leaders do not look out the window waiting for someone else to improve their situation they look in the mirror . They demonstrate their belief that the collective actions of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on results . This belief enables them to rally rather than retreat when faced with setbacks because they assume that negative events are temporary glitches rather than the permanent state of affairs that pessimists see , and that setbacks are due to specific causes that can be identified and fixed . They stay the course . <p> 4 ) - Their ability to think systematically The most effective team leaders see the interconnections between the work of their teams and the improvement of their schools and districts . Whereas ineffective leaders will view the work of teams as a series of disjointed tasks to be accomplished for a checklist , effective team leaders are able to connect the dots. - They bring coherence to the collaborative team process . <p> If you are looking for a great read on district and building leadership , then I would suggest reading " Leaders of Learning . " Additionally , if your school is considering , beginning , or underway when it comes to implementing PLCs , then this book is a must read for all the members on your leadership teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you use when developing a system of shared leadership , as well as what characteristics do you look for when selecting team and committee leaders ?

My students had no reason to think about their work I , as the grade giver , would reflect on their work for them .

Its a chance for them to see that what they do and what they think really matters . If I took control of the grades then the reflections would be like an empty promise . All talk , no action . <p> I appreciate courage it took to act upon your reflections . Anytime a teacher abandons one of those deep seated cultural practices ( and grading is one of the biggies ) it always creates some tension in the ranks .

One of the great things about blogging is we have a medium through which we are able to connect with one another and engage in conversations that push us to really think about our practice .

The incredible thing about all of it was that it was entirely student led , and watching it unfold made my heart want to burst. - It never ceases to amaze me what young people can do when they are allowed to lead their own learning , and to find ways to bring their passions to life .

It did just what we hoped it would do , which is to change our school and community in immeasurable ways , and to move us in a direction that leads to service , sustainability , student agency , innovation and change . <p> I can not wait to see the kids tomorrow and to reflect on the past several days .

I 've gone to some great conferences this year.some were strong in technology , some were great with content , but we need to start seeing a mesh of both to get to where we want to be as " lead learners " . Technology should be utilized to ENHANCE instruction , not control it . Instruction should be driven by strong pedagogy and we as administrators need to model and support this line of thinking , not just pushing apps or other consumptive measures .

Teachers should n't either . <p> Utilizing a form of technology means nothing in a classroom if its just for the sake of the tool . I 've talked about the concept of focusing on the verbs , not the nouns before . George said that even going 1:1 can be a $1000 pencil if we do n't  allow connections and collaborations . There was a lot of talk at this conference about teachers relinquishing control and allowing students to have a voice in their learning . Students will complete assignments for a teacher because it was due . If they were creating to be shared with the wold , they would care a whole lot more . It can be good enough enough just to turn in , but for the world theyll want it to be GREAT . Obviously this is a big picture ideal , but where can you start ?

How will we become co-learners with teachers in our boards and with each other to form a larger collective ?

In reality , not everyone has nostalgic memories this time of the year . <p> Last Thursday I talked to a teacher about a boy ( whom I will call Johnny ) who was having a hard time in her class . Specifically , he was shutting down , and no matter what strategies she tried , he was n't responding . <p> From what I know about his challenges outside of school , I was not surprised .

@@58740572 @7740572/ <h> 5 Ways To Cultivate A Culture Of Acceptance <p> The other day , I sat in a conversation with a student and a DHS worker who had come to take her into custody . She was no longer able to stay at her host home and would be moving back to a shelter till a new home could be found . In the meantime , she would go to a different school . <p> As she sat in tears listening to the news , she said to the DHS worker , " No offense , lady , but DHS has done nothing for me . Ive been from home to home , in and out the shelter , and from school to school . This was supposed to be my fresh start . " <p> In situations like this , we are all subject to the law . It did n't  matter that this girl was in my school and wanted to stay . The decision had been made , her history was long and complicated , and she would soon be off to another place . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't  make situations like this any easier to face . And this scenario was particularly hard to bear because of what she said next . <p> " I mean , " she went on , " When I came here , the other kids werent mean to me . Some actually shook my hand in the hall when they met me . I havent had anyone bully me or treat me wrong here . This is a place where I have felt safe . There wont be another school like this one . " <p> I had to turn away for a moment and gather my composure . <p> A Culture of Acceptance I know our school is not perfect , but we are intentional about developing a culture of belonging . <p> Although it is hard to put a finger on the tangible ways this kind of culture can been encouraged , here a few actions we have taken over the years toward that end : <p> 1 . Fostering a school-pride I know encouraging school-spirit may seem a thing of the past , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of which they can be proud . When I refer to our students as Bulldogs , for instance , I want to remind them they are a part of a community of people cheering each other onto higher achievement . Creating a sense of belonging first means helping students find pride in community to which they belong . <p> 2 . Modeling respectful interaction As a leadership team , our principals and counselors make it a priority be in every classroom at the start of each school year . It would be much easier to talk to 750 of students in a school assembly , but we like the opportunity to see them in smaller settings . In classroom meetings , you can still look them in the eyes as you talk about school expectations . And you can model to them by how you address them the ways you expect them to address each other . <p> 3 . Celebrating students and teachers We are not a " Great Expectations " school , but our teachers have adopted many of the same philosophies of that program in interacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try hard , and reach goals . It also means celebrating teachers who go the extra mile to serve students by highlighting teachers of the month . <p> As you recruit and hire new teachers , you should make it goal to find teachers who instruct with excellence AND care deeply about students . <p> 4 . Encouraging student-driven initiatives A few years ago , we approached our student council with the question : how could students encourage students in treating everyone in our school with respect ? <p> They began to brainstorm and came up with an idea they entitled STANDStudents Tolerating Absolutely No Discrimination . <p> By partnering with a local non-profit , they began hosting assemblies , classroom chats , and freshman-focused seminars . They lead the discussions and conversations about treating others with dignity . <p> 5 . Office climate = school climate You cant expect students to respect one another if adults do n't  do the same . One of the values you should talk about among office staff , for instance , is treating every person who visits as a guest . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect . So make it a goal to model that in your office first . <p> What happens in the office is often contagious in the rest of the school . <p> Conclusion As heart-wrenching as it was to watch a student led away by DHS , it was also a good reminder of how important it is to encourage positive interactions for all students at our school . <p> My school is certainly far from perfect . Like every school , we still have instances of bullying . Just recently , we had to meet with a group of students to talk about offensive behaviors they were displaying at a public event . <p> But these set-backs should not deter us from reaching for the ideal . Cultivating a positive school culture happens when you encourage school-pride , model respectful interaction , celebrate strong students and teachers , allow student-driven solutions , and set a tone of respect from the front office to the classroom . <p> It makes a difference in the overall health of students for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may only be with us for a short time . <p> Now Its Your Turn What are ways you are encouraging a culture of acceptance where you serve ?

Photo from http : //bit.ly/pvuhJa <p> As our school moves to attempt to add another stream of communication to parents via SMS ( text messaging ) , I have been asked " how many ways do we need to communicate with parents ? " - Should parents not just try harder to stay informed of their childs education ? <p> My responses are twofold : <p> We need to differentiate our parent communication so we meet families where they are. - Each family has a varied level of involvement and engagement due to time availability , access to technology , and ability to exchange in dialogue. - Some families have the cultural capital ( non-financial social assets like time , money , confidence , etc ) to engage in ongoing face-to-face dialogue with the principal , teachers and staff at their childs school ; others prefer to use technology ( email , blog comments , Facebook , etc ) to communicate while some families are content ( or due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive information from the school . <p> We need to be clear of the difference between communicating TO families and communicating WITH families. - There is a purpose for both but we need to be very clear that TO and WITH serve different needs for our families. - Communicating TO families is a way of broadcasting information while communicating WITH families is a way of exchanging in dialogue . <p> So with the understanding that we need to meet families where they are and we need to use a number of different tools to communicate both TO and WITH families , what are some ways we can do this ? <p> The key with parent communication is clarity of PURPOSE. - We can not say that we communicate WITH parents effectively if we are not visible in the public and our technology does not encourage feedback and dialogue. - Technology is not a replacement for face-to-face dialogue but can be used in a way to increase the likelihood of these meetings through developing confidence and better school-family relationships . <p> Schools have traditionally worked to improve communication TO parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We , as educational leaders , need to increase dialogue and communication WITH families by not only making ourselves more visible but also by embracing the available social media tools to meet parents and families where they are . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 5 Comments <p> Youve raised a very valid point regarding the difference between TO and WITH in school-parent communication . Some schools tend to favor one for the other ( or worse , simply fails to differentiate between these ) , which results to both parties ( school and the family ) losing valuable opportunities to come together . <p> Also , regarding the question posed to you multiple times , I would have answered , " as many as possible " . I would rather err on the side of overcommunicating things than leaving people out of the loop . <p> Very timely article as I was just having a conversation tonight around enhancing parent school communication with a good friend . You make a good point in clarifying the " with " and " to " ! The other thing I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between what the school wants to tell parents and what the parents want to know . Sometimes I think there is a disconnect there . what are your thoughts ? Do you actively engage parents in the discussion around what type of things they would like to see in these communications ? <p> Interesting article . Many of our schools try to focus on parental engagement not just an outbound supply of school information , but a method of involving parents in certain aspects of schools through feedback , discussion and effective management . <p> Technology is constantly improving to allow more online paperless ways of communicating which many schools have effectively used to improve child well being and learning through greater parent involvement . <p> Great article and very timely for me .

Your point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication with the school takes a new angle and one which our team needs to look at and recognise , rather than just blaming some families for not being more engaged . We would like to consider SMS and Facebook communications and do better in sending communications that actually encourage replies and feedback . Lack of replies is feedback that our systems are not encouraging dialogue so we need to look at alternatives . Thankyou for this food for thought !

Having been an educator for 21+ years you would think that I have figured out that what I do is important or that I would have moved on to something different . The fact is education is my passion . <p> I am lucky , going to school is what I do and I look forward to it everyday . There are days that I experience unpleasant things , but I do not find what I do for a living unpleasant . That is just it , I find that the work I do makes ( in a distant second to my family ) life worth living . I could not feel this way if I did not believe in what I do . <p> Recently- I read a couple of blogposts and an article in Time Magazine , that have me thinking about passion , students , what is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Karl Fisch posited in his post Do You Believe in Algebra ? that we really need to move beyond the one size fits all approach to school . I agree that not all students need to know everything we are requiring in our standards based approach to education . Where does passion fit in ? Where does learning how to make a difference fit in ? How many of our students go on to get a degree in math ? Science ? We need to focus on skills ! As I think back to my days in public school , it may be the time elapsed , but there is very little that I had to learn that I still use today outside of reading , writing , and working with other people . High school was information based when I went to school . I can remember cramming for tests , but I have little to no recollection of what it was I memorized . It was gone days after the test I suppose . Unfortunately , high school is still information based . Sometimes subjects are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information is from the lecture or reading the text .

The world has imitated us and our culture for the last century and they continue to do so today . If we have concluded that our schools are no longer working and are not preparing todays students to compete for jobs and create the next generation of innovations to fuel the American dream , why do we propose to do more of the same in our schools and measure it with an ever stronger magnifying glass ?

Schools must evolve along with this phenomenon . <p> Recently , George Couros posted Why We Become Teachers , - - in which he argues that we must fashion our schools around passion not subjects . Students come to us today more likely to be uninterested or unable attend to school as it has been done for the past 100 years . We do n't  have to explain it .

If you walk into a class room and see a majority of kids engaged today it is either because the kids are motivated by working to together or by a presentation that is put together by a passionate educator using multiple approaches to grab the learners . Students will gravitate to a teacher that demonstrates caring and interest in his/her students . In order for schools to work there has to a belief among the students that what they are doing matters . That the learning and acquisition of skills has significance outside of the classroom . It is hard to create this environment where all students are held to the same set of standards . What is meaningful and significant to one student is not to the next one . The most important part of education is the make sure those students today become as flexible in their learning as possible and to know that learning is not a part of life , it is life . <p> I believe what I do is important , and working to make education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday a labor of love .

" I often observe interactions between leaders in schools and teachers . I watch the body language and I listen to the words used and the tone in which they are spoken . The relationship between school leaders and teachers is so crucial to moving schools forward , so much so that I have often considered the impact of the language that leaders and teachers use when communicating with each other . <p> I am particularly interested in how we use possessive adjectives and believe that how we use these adjectives can either bring school teams together , or divide them . <p> I believe that the use of the possessive adjective , my , in schools , can be particularly detrimental to collaboration that is so essential to school improvement .

We may hear the following sentence : " That will not work with my class . " From this , one can get a sense that there is a barrier between that teacher and their colleagues and the leaders in the school . When we hear a teacher talk about " my free periods , " it can easily be interpreted as the non-contact time belonging solely to the teacher . In fact the non-contact teaching time does not belong to the teacher at all , it is time that should be used dedicated to the achieving the mission and the vision of the school . This can oftentimes lead to conflicts over the use of the time , especially if when a teacher is required to undertake particular tasks or attend collaborative planning meetings . <p> School leaders , on the other hand , can fall into the trap of using the word , you .

Being supportive and showing them that the decisions will help your organization move in the right direction should ( hopefully ) get everyone on the same page ! <p> You are so right .

@@58740612 @7740612/ <h> We Are All Connected <p> From LONG ... <p> Relationships are the key foundation to the success of students in our schools . The more we connect with them , the more likely they are to succeed . This is not only true with our students , but also essential with our staff . If we know those we serve , the more likely we are to all be successful . <p> This is why it is frustrating when there is talk that the use of technology and social media sites actually disconnects our students , when in my own experience , I have found the opposite . The more I have connected through our staff and student blogs , the more I have learned about them and what is happening in the classroom . After reading Stephen Johnsons , Everything Bad is Good For You , I was comforted that I was not alone in the belief . <p> Johnson discusses that most of the technology that has impacted our current time , has been social in nature : <p> " In fact , nearly all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years have been tools for augmenting social connection " <p> As technology progresses , the need for connection remains . Mashable recently wrote an article on the " 5 Predictions for the Music Industry in 2011 " , and predicted that the Ping network on iTunes would not be successful since it seems to be focused " more on commerce than social " , although it has tried to integrate this element through the use of Twitter . The same article also predicted that artists would become more social as this has been beneficial to their growth in a changing environment . If anything , technology is giving us new opportunities to connect and interact with one another . <p> As educators , we need to continue to find safe and effective ways for our students to have the opportunity to participate in this human network . Johnson contends that if anything , technology has forced us to grow : <p> " The rise of the Internet has challenged our minds in three fundamental and related ways : by virtue of being participatory , by forcing users to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction . " <p> If relationships are the foundation of our schools , and technology helps to create and enhance these , it is hard to contest that social media should not be more apparent in our learning environments . 170078 @qwx580078 <h> Related <h> 2 Comments <p> Thank you George . Keep spreading the word about CONNECTIONS . You know my beliefs on this topic . My theme for years to the staff has been to maximize student learning we must make connections and build relationships . We need to be connected with our students and staff but with some we also need to build a deeper , trusting relationship . ( ie the gift of a tie ) Do connected principals create connected schools ? If not , are the really connected ? Merry Christmas <p> I totally agree with you Rich . I have seen many administrators talk about the importance of using technology but yet are not giving their students the opportunity to learn beyond their four walls . It is huge that we give our students the ability to safely connect with one another .

Leadership is not about the leader . Its about how the leader buids the capacity of others . You obviously work with some great teachers , but that is n't often enough to create a great school . Someone ties it all together with influence , nudging , and the occasional positive nag . Watching others excel is as satisying as it gets as a leader . Congratualtions on a great night and what I imagine to be a great school . That does n't  happen by accident . <p> First of all , the brownies were fantastic and had Valentines Day-themed icing . = And thanks so much for your supportive comments , Tom !

One of them , which I still think about on a regular basis , has shaped who I am as a leader in a very profound way . You see , almost ten years ago , during my first year as an administrator , I had the opportunity to advocate for a student who needed my support . This student was being bullied by a teacher and needed me to stand up for them . The relationship was negatively impacting this students ability to be successful in school , and it warranted a hard conversation and some quick action from mebut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what I needed to do . I 'm not proud of that experience , and it haunts me to this day , but looking back on it , it may just be the most important leadership lesson that I 've ever learned . From that moment on , every time that I have been faced with a hard conversation , or a difficult decision , I think of that kidand the conversation becomes easier . Because of that one incident , that regret , I no longer lack the courage that is needed to be a true student advocate , and ultimately , dealing with difficult situations has become a strength of mineits all about learning , growing , and becoming betterand seeing a regret , or a mistake as an opportunity to become a better version of yourself . <p> - - - - I 've since reached out to that student , and we talked through the incident from both our perspectives , and I apologized for not being there when they needed me .

People will make mistakes , and it is easy to hold grudges or to judge , and to let it affect you in unhealthy ways . The way to move forward , and to truly own your life is to forgive , and to let it go . I know its hard but its freeing for both parties . I 've made a practice of forgiving in my life , and I 've learned to say what it is that I need to say to people . One of the biggest forms of regret are the things that go unsaid . The times in your life when you did n't  thank someone when they deserved your appreciation , or when you did n't  tell someone you loved them enough , or when you held your tongue when you really should of spoken your truth .

Let things go that are bringing negative energy into your life and take control . For my part , I 'm off to write a couple of emails to people who need to hear from me and I 'm excited about it .

@@58740624 @7740624/ <h> Guskey and Grading : Lots to Think About <p> from Wikimedia CommonsThis article is adapted from the version on my blog in March 2010 <p> In education , the rule of thumb is that if you can use one thing learned at a conference then you should consider it a success . <p> In March , I joined several staff members from my building and my district at a conference with Thomas Guskey . Dr. Guskey spoke about ways to make grading and report cards more effective and more fair . While much of his presentation was presented in his new book Practical Solutions for Serious Problems in Standards-Based Grading , he made our group think about our practice in a deep way . The group of teachers was so intrigued by what they 'd heard that they all agreed to work with me to create a session on our grading practices with the faculty for the May Professional Development half day . Here are some of his main ideas , in italics , with my thoughts interspersed . <p> Why do we use report cards and assign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards or grades serve ? What elements should teachers use in determining students ' grades ? <p> We do n't agree on the purpose of grades . That 's the first problem . The various purposes are at adds with another . <p> Decide the purpose of grades first . Print it right on the report card for the parents to see . <p> This is the work that the teachers feel we need to do next . What is the purpose of grades and report cards ? Communication with parent ? Improving learning ? Accountability ? Middle school or private school admissions ? Permanent record ? Punishment ? Celebration ? None of the above ? All of the above ? <p> Grading is not essential to learning . Checking is essential to learning . <p> His idea here is that grading is not essential to the instructional process . What they need to learn well is someone checking on their learning ; someone to guide them and shape their experiences . <p> Grading is evaluative , teacher is a Judge . Checking is Diagnostic , teacher is an Advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher . We do our best work with children when they believe we are on their side . I see many teachers make strong connections with the students not just deliver strong content . <p> Make the first assessment and grade the one that is most likely for kids to be successful as it will set the tone for that child . <p> When I taught , I told all of my students that they were starting the term with 100% , an A. Some never had that high a grade before and were very excited . If I had also followed Guskey 's advice and made the first assessment and grade one in which all kids could see success , I am sure that my struggling students would h <p> Averaging is detrimental to students because one low grade affects the high performance of later work . <p> This is a very radical idea to most of us . We have averaged for many years and thought it was the right way to grade . Guskey makes a strong case for carefully considering whether using averages is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made progress . This will surely lead to much discussion . <p> Give priority to most recent evidence : Throw out midterm if final is much better . <p> This point works really with our standards based report card . The idea behind this is that we are interested in the student mastering the standard . So , it should n't matter if earlier in the term or the year the student did n't master the standard . All that matters is that by the end of the term , the student got it . Most teachers were not trained this way . I certainly did not grade this way when I taught middle school . I wish I had . <p> Instead of zero , assign Incomplete and make the work required and immediate . <p> We should not allow students to fail to complete homework . Of course , there are times when a student ca n't get work done ( something happens at home , for example ) . This policy would really be aimed at struggling students who have learned that it is easier to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that student to give up . The zero says that we are not really interested in the student actually learning the material . I am planning on challenging the teachers to ban the zero from their gradebooks . Instead , give incomplete and make the student get the work done . The Before and After School Homework club or a special homework detention would need to be set up so that students have to stay in and get the work done . When we let them get away with a zero we are letting them down . We must insist on there effort . <p> There are many in schools who would say that we are not teaching them responsibility this way . I would answer that a bad grade has rarely taught a student anything . Only a teacher can teach the student a lesson . So , let 's teach them that the work and the learning matter , a lot . <p> Separate out the other stuff ( homework , behavior , attendance , etc ) . Make the grade about the learning , the achievement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does matter and says a lot about a student . When we include those other items in grades , we are diluting what the grade stands for . Also , we end up with grades that do not reflect actual learning . <p> Grades have some value as Rewards , but NO Value as Punishments ! <p> No evidence that low grades motivate a student . The students instead feels that class is not relevant . Do not use grades as weapons . <p> As you can see , Thomas Guskey gave us so much to think about in one conference . I 'd say we broke the rule of thumb . <p> Its not the teachers who are in the deckchairs . And no one wants to toss teachers anywhere . Teachers need all the support we can offer in their work in the " uncanny art of intellectual temptation " ( J.S. Bruner 1962 ) . Let 's work to get the focus back to where it belongs children and learning . <p> You write : " While the system may need to be sunk , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , what are the best strategies for sinking it ? <p> Thanks for bringing this conversation to the CP site . This is one in which I am very passionate . In BC , we are trying to move to more Assessment FOR Learning and less Assessment OF learning . AFL is the ongoing coaching and feedback that takes place while AOL is the judgment that happens at the end that involves a number/letter . NO LEARNING TAKES PLACE WITH GRADING . As you said , if we think grades are a motivation for a struggling student , we need to give our heads a shake . What formative assessment ( assessment for learning ) does is it makes the majority of assessments part of the learning process it is developed through the use of criteria , has student input , and relies on descriptive feedback . Research will tell you that if you put a grade or a mark beside some great descriptive feedback , it negates the value of the descriptive feedback as students only look at the mark . We need to stop grading everything provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When do adults get graded on their learning ? Do we grade each others blogs and tweets ? No , but we do this to kids and university/college students . <p> I hope that in a few years we look back and say , " What the heck were we doing by trying to move learning to a number/letter ? " . <p> I have not provided a mark to a student in 4 years ( this includes 1 year as a high school teacher and 3 years as an intermediate teacher ) . The only grade I give goes on the report card ( because I have to ) . The learning that I see with students since I have made this transition is immense ! I would NEVER go back to marking and grading everything . I ASSESS everything , but I do not mark everything . <p> I could go on and on but if anybody wants to discuss this with me , please email me at chriswejr@gmail.com or contact me on Twitter at @mrwejr . I love this topic ! ! ! <p> Some people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dylan Wiliam , Rick Stiggins , Anne Davies , and Joe Bower . Joe is extremely passionate about this and has abolished grading in his class . <p> Hi Chris : And there are schools where there is no grading . And gasp ! students actually get admitted to college . <p> Point is we have the knowledge . There is the track record . And although individual schools and teachers may need to make the compromises required by the " system " , they do not need to believe it is essential or necessary . <p> And , for as long as they do need to go along , the advice in this post may be helpful ( in rearranging the deckchairs . ) <p> I would love to hear more about how you used no marks in a school where that was not the norm . Did you need to prepare your admin and parents ? What about the kids ; did they need lots of work on your system ? <p> Until last spring , I did not realize the power of these ideas . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> There are lots of place in the world of data analysis where averaging results in misleading numbers . The classic is the average income in Kuwait where the billionaires skew the average to a number that makes the average person look well off . If fact , the average person is rather poor . We need a grading system where student efforts can be aggregated so that once their pile of effort and achievement is high enough they can move on to the next topic or course . The worst thing that can happen in this kind of system is no movement as it is impossible to go backwards . This is n't the case with a system that averages efforts . Courses should have check points that students can challenge whenever they want and try as many times as necessary with no penalty for the number of times they do n't  make the grade . This of course begs for an online component to do as much of the assessment as possible . Results of tries that do n't  make it can be used to inform instruction for individuals and groups .
