Utterly compelling story full of so many different elements and intrigue , and still so fresh on the minds of those who knew and loved her . Probably the most memorable episode yet , even considering the chilling competition of Anneliese Michel and the Weepy Voiced Killer episodes . Very well done as always . Keep the stories coming ! <p> I just listened to this one and it left me far angrier than any of the other unsolved ones . I felt like there were gaping holes in the police work in this case .

This one just really frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were just ignored by the police . <p> Who said Jason never submitted a DNA sample ? Jason was arrested and detained at the police station . He was asked to submit a DNA sample prior to his release . In other words , he would not have been released if he did not give a sample of his DNA . Here in Canada , they can take a sample of your DNA when you are a suspect in a serious crime . They do not need your permission . Do n't  forget , they had access to Jason and Lindsays condo via a search warrant . They could have easily retrieved Jasons DNA . Jason fully cooperated with the police and it was a silly little rumor that someone started that Jason did not provid a DNA sample . <p> There are some people who have denied that Jason was arrested but he was .
