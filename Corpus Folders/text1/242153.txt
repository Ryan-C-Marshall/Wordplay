@@36964578 @5964578/ <h> QR Codes , Barcodes , and RFID : What 's the Difference ? <p> Barcodes have been around for decades . They are versatile with a large variety of uses " especially in retail , - manufacturing settings , and in transport and shipping . <p> - <p> We 're used to seeing the common barcode printed on packaging at the grocery store or in other retail outlets , like when items are passed over the barcode reader at the checkout counter to ring up a sale . Barcodes not only are valuable at the point of sale , but also for managing inventory and raw materials internally , so that tracking is done accurately and without error. - <p> - <p> Barcodes have become common in shipping , to enable greater accuracy and speed in getting packages delivered . And barcodes are used to manage large filing systems , library books , and a host of other purposes where large numbers of items need to be tracked efficiently . <p> - <p> Barcodes are a relatively inexpensive solution- help to reduce labor costs , drive efficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Codes <p> - <p> A recent trend among small businesses is the growing use of QR codes . QR codes are similar in one sense to barcodes , in that they contain information , but must be read by a 2D barcode reader like the Scanfob- 3002i Scanner , - or by camera-equipped smartphones . <p> - <p> QR codes have been around for years , but in the last 12 months there has been a skyrocket in- usage- among entrepreneurs as mobile tablet and smartphone markets have grown- dramatically . QR Codes are well suited for marketing purposes , ticketing , container tracking , and more . It is becoming more common to receive business cards with QR Codes on them . Thit way , you get access to a lot more information than can fit on a small card . For instance , you might hand out business cards at an event containing a QR code that leads people to a Web page with a special offer for attendees . Or the QR Code on a business card might contain a V-card ( digital business card ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manually input the card information . <p> - <p> Your business might give out promotional materials , - such as a coffee mug imprinted with a QR code where someone can find out more information about your company. - Or how about imprinting a QR Code on one of those pop-up banners when exhibiting at your next trade show ? Attendees can scan your company 's information by holding their smartphones up to the banner " so you do n't have to shell out for expensive printed materials and they do n't have to lug that heavy paper home on the plane . <p> - <p> QR Codes have infinite uses in small businesses , especially for marketing and asset tracking . <p> - <p> - <p> RFID <p> - <p> RFID ( radio frequency identification ) has likewise been around for decades. - However , RFID tends to require more technological hand-holding and setup . RFID involves applying or embedding RFID tags to items or boxes or pallets . Tags vary greatly in size , shape and capabilities . The RFID tag- antenna is energized- by an RFID reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and read by the RFID reader , like the- idChamp RS2 Bluetooth RFID/NFC Reader , conveying information from the tag about the item it is affixed to . <p> - <p> RFID is adaptable to many of the same use- cases that barcodes are great for , and in some cases where barcodes are- not- an option , but the need to accurately track is present . RFID is especially useful in situations where vast quantities of goods must be moved or tracked , or where tracking of item-specific information is necessary- like in supply chains , manufacturing , laboratory environments , agricultural services , - and employee tracking . <p> - <p> RFID has been mandated by some customers , such as Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense to track the vast quantities of items they in their supply chains and to supply much more detailed reporting- information . In such situations , RFID is able to do it more quickly , effectively , and efficiently than barcodes . <p> - <p> - <p> Conclusion <p> - <p> RFID , barcodes and QR Codes all have their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , the cost to acquire and use continues to drop with each passing year .

Recently , this group has been employing an RFID-based solution to track football helmets as they are retrieved from local youth football organizations to be tested or refurbished , with an end goal of helping to prevent head injuries for young athletes . <p> - <p> NOCSAE is carrying out the testing on behalf of a consortium of athletic and safety associations . The members of this group include not only NOCSAE , but the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , the NFL , USA Football , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the National Athletic Equipment Reconditioners Association ( NAERA ) , the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association ( SGMA ) as well as helmet makers like Rawlings , Riddell , Schutt and Xenith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pronounced serial IO ) , consists of passive EPC Gen 2 RFID tags and readers , as well as software to manage the collected read data . NOCSAE used the technology throughout the summer of 2012 , tracking which helmets they received from their service providers ( helmet-refurbishing companies ) and identifying the headgear when NOCSAE later retrieved it for testing . <p> - <p> NOCSAE and several- researchers from a handful of- universities are currently in the process of investigating how well helmets in use will meet the standards for protecting players from concussions during play . According to Michael Oliver , the NOCSAE 's executive director and general counsel , states that NOCSAE is testing the older helmets which may not meet these standards in the hopes to remove and replace unsafe gear for helmets that- would provide proper protection against head injuries during football games and practices . <p> - <p> In 2012 , the consortium launched a program in which they offered to replace helmets for youth football clubs in disadvantaged regions , provided that the headgear was more than ten years old . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four markets : the California Bay Area , Gulf Coast region , Northern Ohio and the tri-state region around New York City . NOCSAE hired helmet reconditioning and refurbishing businesses to retrieve the headgear , inspect it as well as store it for NOCSAE , whom would later run tests on some of those helmets as part of the study . <p> - <p> The research project required a database that could record details regarding each helmet ; Oliver says , as well as make it easy for NOCSAE to locate that helmet at a later date . He determined that RFID would be the best solution for such a venture since the technology could not only enable a user equipped with a handheld reader to identify each helmet but would also make a particular helmet easy to later locate using a Geiger-counter mode on the handheld reader . <p> - <p> Serialio provided seven of its Scanfob- Ultra-BB GEN2 RFID readers , and its GRID-IN-HAND- Mobile Grid software solution . Upon picking up the helmets , the refurbishing companies transported them to their facilities , attached an Alien Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each helmet 's exterior , and read the tag using the Scanfob Ultra-BB reader . That data was then transmitted , via a Bluetooth connection , to a mobile phone and back to a server . At the end of the day , the information was uploaded to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which provided each helmet 's make , model , manufacturing date and RFID number , along with data indicating who had possession of the helmet .

It is easy keeping track of on hand items and adding new items to our system .

This has taken our security department to a new level of patrol quality and performance .

The estimated work related cost savings for our department is approximately $6,000 dollars per year in record keeping and employee labor . We are proud to be Serialio.com customers . I recommend this equipment and software to all security professionals <p> My company provides bicycle valet service in Portland Oregon . Bicycle valet is a very new industry in the United States so we had to the opportunity to start from scratch to develop a system to check in and out bicycles . We choose to use Serialio.com to provide our solution with Grid-In-Hand- Mobile Grid iOS app , and the idChamp RS2 NFC reader . Their customer service is fast , professional , and have always helped us to solve any problems . Here is a video showing how we have integrated out idChamp RS2 NFC reader into our valet service . <p> We recently implemented a prototype for a cold-chain management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped us put the solution together . The system keeps track of the temperature and location of each tag , and uploads them to a server which is accessible from the internet . We used the Grid-In-Hand- Mobile Grid app running on an Android phone to upload the data . The solution was cutting-edge in that used pre-production samples of temperature-sensing RFID tags from Wavetrend , a UK-based RFID company . <p> Beyond the fact that the solution worked flawlessly , I want to highlight the truly outstanding service we got from Serialio.com . They made software changes to the Mobile Grid app without having access to the RFID parts , simply working off of data sheets from Wavetrend . When the parts arrived from the UK , they worked over the weekend to iron out the last-minute glitches and get the software to read and display the data in the correct format . A custom version of the app was delivered to us to work with our new RFID tags . Our demo was highly successful , and we owe a great deal to Serialio.com 's dedication and enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you build a solution for your specific RFID needs . But it is their service and willingness to invest in your success that truly sets them apart ! <p> Note : This solution can also be provided on iOS , OS X , Windows , Windows Phone , and more <p> We saved 2.5 to 3 days time by scanning the inventory as opposed to manually entering it . Even better we saved $4,200 for the three handheld material transaction scanning units . <p> - <p> - <p> I recently implemented wireless scanning of inventory . Our ERP software uses a web interface to input data into the inventory . Upon initial research , I was distraught by the costs of the motorola and dolphin wireless barcode scanners . At $2,000 and up it was a tough sell to get the number of scanners I needed . Then I found Serialio.com and their Scanfob- Brand Bluetooth barcode scanner . The thought of pairing a barcode scanner with an iPod touch to scan inventory was exciting , the cost was a no-brainer and I picked one up to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system I was lucky enough to get my hands on a couple evaluation units of the " industry standard " scanners to test out up against my- Scanfob- 200x Bluetooth laser barcode scanner . I was shocked by how difficult the other units were to configure and use , especially up against the iPod with Scanfob- 200x unit . I had multiple people try out each of the test units , as well as the- Scanfob- 200x. - Every single person chose the- Scanfob- 200x as their prefered device. - In total we saved two and a half to three days time by scanning the inventory as opposed to manually entering it . But that is not the best point ! We saved approximately $1,400 each ( including the price of an iPod touch ) . In total we saved $4,200 for the three handheld units we wanted scanning material transactions . We now get the benefit of using iOS 's user friendly interface with the- Scanfob- 200x barcode scanners . There is no competition that even comes close . I would recommend to anyone looking at buying a wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other units , and you will see that I am not leading you wrong . Please tell everyone this was written off the cuff , and I did not stretch the truth one bit . I appreciate your great product , and I will be buying more in the future . Thank you . <p> The scanner is excptional fast and reliable providing us complete accuracy scanning barcode seals on tops and bottoms of railroad cars . We also appreciate the excellent inspection software solution provided by Serialio.com and how it provides a seamless solution with the iPad . A single inspection error can cost over $6,000 so we really appreciate the accuracy and ease-of-use of the rail car inspection solution . - <p> Your Scanfob- Brand Scanner product is working great . We are pleased at the easy setup and use of the scanner with our iPhone programs . It has tremendously increased our productivity and customer service within our organization . We are sure that our inventory accountability will be more accurate since using the Scanfob- Brand Scanners over the old system and we are satisfied that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented attitude and reliability is what we looked for in purchasing your product and commend you on a job well done . If our need for further scanners arises , we will certainly contact your company for assistance . <p> We have a greenhouse propagation data recording system . Previously it involved lugging around a laptop and a corded barcode scanner . The corded ( USB ) scanner behaved poorly in bright sunlight , and the cord always managed to drag on and disturb small seedlings . We wanted to move all the data collection and note-taking functions to a easy to use system on iPhone / iPad , and wanted to get a better barcode scanner . Our first attempt involved a Baracoda Pencil2 Bluetooth barcode wand scanner , thinking that using a wand would eliminate the bright ambient light problem , but actually the wand had a hard time scanning the plant tag barcodes in ANY light , I think because the tag material is fairly glossy . The Bluetooth Pen scanner also would not connect to the iOS devices . The Scanfob- 2002 was recommended to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - Scanfob- 2006 engine is even better it also emulates a Bluetooth keyboard on the iPhone / iPad without additional software so it 's a breeze to use . The Scanfob- 2002 is so lightweight and compact I keep it in my pants pocket with a retractable key lanyard on my belt loop , so that it is always available for use whether I 'm expecting it or not . It 's remarkable that such a small unit is a true scanning laser , and not a CCD imager . I highly recommend the Scanfob- 2002 ! <p> Our company recently developed- oneScanG , a new warehouse scanning solution that runs on the iPadG and needed to find a reliable , cost-effective scanner to recommend to our customers . We purchased a Scanfob- 200x to test with our software and were please to find it worked brilliantly on the iPadG. - The Serialio support team 's knowledge , and the high level of customer service they provided was more than enough to prove to me that we had found not only the right product , but also the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers .

The Scanfob- 200x Bluetooth barcode reader is simply the best choice : simple and efficient , robust and small device , on top of an excellent and very reactive technical support . We tried several industrial products which were all either too complex or not suitable for barcoding in various environmental conditions . The Scanfob- 200x is the ideal companion of our iPad and Windows-based applications . <p> Our new ( old school ) scanners are working well .

Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what we needed here and Serialio was a perfect fit . Our needs are actually quite simple compared to the vast array of products and methodologies supported and sold by Serialio ; we just need to capture barcodes and time/dates and then download to Excel at the end of the day with a simple serial cable . SerialMagic Professional makes this incredibly simple . All of the products and support we have received from Serialio have always been outstanding . I have wholeheartedly recommended Serialio to other City departments that have examined our bar code operations . I have also recommended Serialio to friends of mine who own various small businesses in Texas . As a lifelong utilitarian , I always try to go first with what works best . Serialio works best ! <p> Thank you for your excellent recent response to my recent RMA request .

It is most important to consider- your users , the scanning environment , and requirements . Do you perform the majority of the tasks in a warehouse or other harsh environment ? One-time use or reusable ? What read range do you need ?

A good vendor will usually offer to test tags with your reader beforehand to ensure feasibility and confirm expected tag output . <p> - <p> Which Tag Protocol is most appropriate ? NFC is often a catch-all term for high and low-frequency RFID tags and readers . But it is much more granular than that . There are many different types of protocols such as iClass , iCode , MiFare , AWID , PROX , Hitag , Indala , Casi-Rusco and more . iCode and MiFare are typically the most popular high-frequency cards .

SPP provides vastly increased power and usability , such as moving data only to a specific window , downloading data under program control , etc . HID lacks the ability to communicate back to the scanner and must accept all the data as ASCII keystrokes , so using encryption and advanced features are not feasible . One common example of application layer encryption is for 2D barcodes where barcode data must be decrypted by the application in order to use it ; this is not feasible with HID . <p> This simple interface is inherent to the design philosophy of HID . HID is meant to interact with the active window on a computer as a human would . This eliminates the possibility of any background processing that is available with SPP .

The standard cable should work fine with a null modem adapter and a device such as a serial modem without any of the modifications since such devices generally support RS-232 control signals . <p> The problem is that the RS-232 level converter chip inside the bulge in the cable does not get power from the Axim unless the SEL line on the Axim side is pulled to ground . <p> Usually this is done when the device connected to the serial cable asserts DTR ( pin 4 ) a transistor in the blob pulls the SEL line low and the converter chip activates . However , GPS devices only use Transmit and Receive lines(generally) so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cable will work to receive NMEA , but generally it wo n't work bidirectionally . With the transistor modification ( and disabling activesync ) you should be able to plug your GPS and start GPS software in any order without problems or lockups . ( At present it does appear if the Axim powers off while the GPS is sending data and the GPS software is running it loses the GPS , I have found no fix for this yet . ) <p> If you do n't mind possibly breaking your Axim and Serial cable , you can open the bulge and solder a wire between SEL and GND on the Axim side of the adapter board . <p> On the other hand , if you do n't want to hack your cable , there are several ways to make things work right . <p> The first way to bypass this is to use a parasitic power system where the Transmitted data from the GPS also is used to trigger the DTR line so the Axim knows something is attached . However , this only works when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this triggered fine , but it probably wo n't work with a protocol the Axim initiates , such as a Garmin protocol transfer . <p> In testing , 100 ohms , and 1000uF works fine for a Garmin in NMEA mode at 4800bps . The Dell chip stays triggered and all the lines stay active . However , in Garmin mode , there is no transmission from the GPS so there is no way to trigger that circuit . <p> A battery adapter connects batteries to pin 4 which makes the Axim think there is a device attached . ( The minimum voltage that triggers the Axim is about 1.6V ) The problem with this is that the batteries will eventually go dead if they continue to be attached to the Axim part of the cable . The draw appears to be about 1mA , so about 30 days out of a set of AAA batteries is the estimate if continually attached . To deal with this , the cable can be detached from the Axim , and remain attached to the GPS cable . This DOES allow 2-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine in testing with G7ToCE . <p> The use of the diodes allows the DSR signal to power DTR when the Dell port is activated to save a bit of power . The batteries connect to a Ge diode to reduce the voltage drop a bit . Both diodes can be eliminated by removing the connection to pin 6 , And directly connect only the batteries to pin 4 . <p> Connection Summary : Axim side , loop 7-8 , Connect the bands of the 2 diodes to pin 4 . Connect the other end of the Ge diode ( or a 1N4148 ) to the positive on the batteries . Connect the other end of the other diode to pin 6 on the Axim side . Connect pin 5 axim to pin 5 on the other connector and to the negative side of the batteries.Connect pin 2 on the Axim side to 3 on the GPS side , and pin 3 on the Axim side to pin 2 on the GPS side . <p> Internal connections on Axim side <p> Assembled connector <p> This is a simple modification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from the GPS . When the Axim asserts DSR ( pin 6 ) the transistor turns on and allows data to flow from the GPS , when DSR is off , no data flows from the GPS . Once you have disabled **43;65;TOOLONG and uncheck Enable Synchronization when Cradled. ) this change makes the Axim not go crazy when the cable is attached without a GPS program running . The Axim leaves DSR off by default , thus no data flows and it does n't get confused . When the GPS program is started and opens the serial port , DSR goes active and data flows . This change can also be made to the first Parasitic power circuit to make it solve the same problem there for NMEA only uses . The transistor is probably not critical any small NPN should work reasonably well , for example a commonly available 2N2222A . The 1K resistor limits the base current to the transistor . It can be wired point to point inside the box like the above picture with just two more parts .

I also recently purchsed the SerialMagic Professional for Windows Mobile software , from Serialio.com , that allows me to use the LaserChamp Bluetooth scanner with my Windows Mobile PDA . This way I can still use the LaserChamp scanner even if I 'm away from my computer . Serialio.com had the scanner I needed at the best price . I have since recommended Serialio.com to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with SerialMagic and the LaserChamp . Thank you ! - David Khol , Owner <p> I am using my Microvision Flic scanner via SerialMagic with the Mac version of ReaderWare for cataloging my books and it is working great . - Hendel Thistletop <p> I am an Online Bookseller and I use the LaserChamp and SerialMagic to scan books in my warehouse .

@@36964940 @5964940/ <h> SerialPort <h> Introduction <p> This document provides notes on using SerialPort with WSDD , and running on WME ( WebSphere Micro Environment ) aka IBM J9 VM MIDP 1.0 . The examples here are for the Palm OS platform , but the concepts are the same for Pocket PC / Windows CE / WinCE . <p> The original SerialPort design was robust enough to port to J2ME MIDP on WME . This allows developers writing to the SerialPort API , to used the same familiar APIs across the board for all their target devices , from Super Computer class , to MIDP class devices . The javax.comm API design is insufficient for such flexibility ; therefore the CommConnection interface was developed to replace javax.comm on MIDP 2.0 . The CommConnection API is even more restrictive than the javax.comm API , and requires the developer to learn another API only to be limited by its design . <p> The following example was built using WSDD-WME version 5.6 Tech Preview . This is WSDD with the 5.6 Tech Preview update . At the time of this writing , instructions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into WSDD-WME <p> Before building your MIDP project using SerialPort , the WME SerialPortMIDP project should be imported into WSDD . This example assumes that the SerialioMIDP project folder from the SerialPort distribution , was placed in the E : Serialio.com folder . <h> Configure the WSDD-WME to use the J9 2.1VM <h> Create a WME J2ME MIDlet project that uses SerialPortMIDP <p> After importing the SerialioMIDP project , your WME is now ready to build a J2ME MIDP project that uses SerialPort . <p> Choose File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Project &gt;&gt; Create MIDlet Suite <p> Next &gt;&gt; enter names for your MIDlet project <p> Now click Finish , and the WME project will be created , and the file SerialPortMIDlet.java should be displayed in the WSDD file edit area . You now build your MIDlet functionality into the project . In this example we will create a simple MIDlet that with a few simple controls allowing the serial port to be opened , and data to be sent . Note in this example " MIDlet suite name " is purposely spelled " myMIDletSite " . <p> Note when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flag an error that indicates " The import Serialio can not be resolved " . To instruct WSDD to use the SerialPortAPI ( the MIDP build ) do the following : On the project root in WSDD Package Explorer ( mySerialPortMIDlet ) , Right-click &gt;&gt; Properties &gt;&gt; Java Build Path . Select the Projects Tab , then select the checkbox by SerialioMIDP , then click OK . <p> The SerialPortMIDlet.java file is- available for download- from serialio.com . Once the file is downloaded , it can be copied over the SerialPortMIDlet.java file created by the WSDD-WME project wizard . For a default WSDD installation on Windows , this would be in the folder " C : Program FilesIBMDevice LONG ... if WSDD is active with the file open when the copy occurs , you will be prompted to accept the new file . <p> Once the MIDlet is complete , the next step is to create a build profile for the Palm OS . <h> Create WSDD-WME Build Profile for Palm OS <p> To create a build profile for the Palm OS , Locate the file " wsddbuild.xml " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Double-click the wsddbuild.xml , this will bring up " Builds " panel for the file . Now click " Add Build " , and you should see the " Create New Ant Build Target " dialog . For the " Platform " entry on the dialog select " J9 for Palm 68k " . <p> Click Next , accept the defaults for the " Jxelink Options " dialog and click Finish . <p> Now the project " . jxeLinkOptions " file needs to be updated . For this project that is the file **27;179;TOOLONG , and is located in the folder " C : Program FilesIBMDevice LONG ... This file can be edited with a standard text editor . Insure the following lines three lines are in the file . <p> -prereq " PalmMidp21 " <p> -includeWholeClass Serialio.SerialConfig <p> -vmOption " **32;208;TOOLONG " <p> If the -prereq " PalmMidp21 " entry is not present , the likely cause is the WSDD 5.6 Tech Preview was not properly installed . <p> Once you have a build profile , the next step is to create one or more Launch Configurations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . jxeLinkOptions- entry <p> " -removeUnused " <p> and without the entry <p> " -includeWholeClass Serialio.SerialConfig " <p> or the VM will crash on startup since one of the Java classes called by the native code will not be present . <p> Create WSDD-WME Launch Configuration for Palm OS <p> To create a Launch Configuration click the arrow next to the Run button on the workbench toolbar and selecting Run ( see image below ) . This option is also available from the Menu using Run &gt;&gt; Run ... <p> Select " MIDlet Suite " , then click New to bring up the Launch Configuration dialog ( not shown in this document ) . In the " Name " field on the Launch Configuration dialog , specify a name for the configuration . For example " mySerialPortMIDlet - SIM " to signify a Launch Configuration for the Palm OS simulator . Now click the " Search " button next to the " MIDlet Suite " field on the " Launch Configurations " dialog . This will bring up a " Select Target " dialog . <p> To create a Device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will need to download and install the Simulator from http : //pluggedin.palm.com . <p> On the Launch Configuration dialog , click the " Configure " button next to the " Device or JRE " field . This brings up Device Configurations dialog . The image below shows example settings for a configuration named " Tungsten C Simulator " . See below for notes on creating a Simulator SnapShot . <p> Once the Device Configuration is created , select it by clicking the " Configure " button next to the " Device or JRE " field on the Launch Configuration dialog , then click " Apply " to save the Launch Configuration . To run the Launch Configuration , click the " Run " Running the WSDD-WME Tungsten C Simulator Palm OS Devicebutton . <p> Note that running SerialPort MIDlets on the simulator , can be used to verify some program logic , but the simulator does not implement the serial port functionality , so serial port functionality needs to be tested on a real Palm device . <p> Depending on what version of the Tungsten C Simulator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following dialog when launched that indicates " Fatal Alert ! palmmain.c , Line:290 , This application can only be run on Palm Tungsten devices . " If your simulator build has this error , simply Click the " Ignore " button and proceed . <p> The MIDlet should then be displayed on the Simulator as shown below . <p> Note : when running a MIDlet on the Tungsten C Simulator , the two files " j9stdout.txt " , and " j9stderr.txt " are used to store stdout , and stderr outputs from the J9VM ( aka WME ) . When the Tungsten C Simulator is launched from WSDD-WME , these files are located in " C : Program FilesIBMDevice Developer " ( default WSDD installation ) . <h> Creating a Palm OS Simulator SnapShot <p> When working with the Palm OS Simulator , your program may need to load other modules for complete testing . To avoid the need to configure the Simulator , and run all of the additional module installations each time the Simulator is started , a Simulator SnapShot can be created . <p> To create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " PalmSim.exe " from the directory where the Simulator was installed . Complete the Simulator ' calibration ' , then load any desired PRC files by dragging them onto the Simulator window . Then on the Simulator window , right-click &gt;&gt; Storage &gt;&gt; Save . Select a location for the SnapShot file , and save it . Use the SnapShot location to fill out the Device Configurations dialog as discussed above . <h> Running the WSDD-WME MIDlet on the Tungsten C <p> First create a Device Configuration and a Launch Configuration for the Tungsten . The process is the same as described above for the Tungsten Simulator , except that the Tungsten Device is selected instead of the Simulator . Below shows the Device Configuration settings for a Tungsten device . Note that entry for the field " Palm install tool executable " field is the install program . <p> On the Launch Configuration dialog , click the " Configure " button next to the " Device or JRE " field , and select the Palm device that was defined in the Device Configurations dialog as discussed above . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device , the SerialPort native library must be installed . This file is installed as a standard Palm OS prc file . <p> To install the program on the Palm device ( Palm Tungsten C in this example ) , run the WSDD-WME Launch Configuration for the Palm Tungsten device , this should queue the PRC installer as shown below . Note that this also shows loading of the SerialPort native shared library . The SerialPort native shared library only needs to be loaded once . <p> Now run HotSync from the Tungsten , and launch the program . The screen shots below show the example program on startup , and after tapping " Open " once , and " Send " 3 times .

The Java Ring uses iButton technology from Dallas Semiconductor . <p> In order to run the demo , a " Blue Dot Reader " must be connected to a serial port on your PC . Information on Java Rings , and readers can found here . <p> This demo requires the following : <p> You must have the Java Plug-in 1.2 or later installed ( 1.2.2 or later if using IE5 ) <p> Currently runs only under WindowsNT/98/95 . <p> A ring ( smart card ) reader application could operate on any platform supported by SerialPort . <h> How It Works <p> Java technology is based on Virtual Machine ( VM ) technology ( or was initially at any rate ) , therefore any access to hardware must be provided via native methods . Native methods are built into Java implementations to provide access to hardware such as the video memory , the sound card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the native methods needed for serial port access . <p> BizRing uses native methods similar to those in the Java SerialPort package to access the serial ports on the browser machine , thus requires native code in the form of a DLL / shared library . <h> Before you can run the BizRing demo you need to perform the following : <p> Have the BusinessCard ' RingLet ' load into the Java Ring . The BusinessCard ' RingLet ' ( also known as a ' jibLet ' ) is included with the iButton developer kit . <p> Download jspWinPiDemo.zip and copy the DLL in it jspWinPiDemo.zip to WinNTSystem32 ( Windows NT ) or WindowsSystem ( Windows 95/98 ) . <p> Edit your Plug-in policy file ( see below ) , or use the supplied policy file in the above downloaded zip . Restart the browser after editing the policy file . <p> Download ocJars.zip and copy the JARS in it the Java Plug-in ext folder . ( the default is C : Program **25;242;TOOLONG ) . Note : if you have installed the iB-IDE you only need to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Although the applet could be configured to run without installing the JAR files locally , it is not practical over a dialup connection because of the number of class files that are used . <h> Plug-in Policy file <p> BizRing sets the Java properties to indicate what serial port the ring ( smart card ) reader is attached to . It also loads the native code to communicate with the ring ( smart card ) reader via the serial port . To authorize BizRing to perform these functions , you need to edit the Plug-in policy file . <p> Note : editing this file should not be required in the future when the Java Plug-in is properly supported by Certification Authorities . <p> If you installed the Plug-in with the default settings this file should be:C : Program LONG ... <p> If you installed the Plug-in with the default settings this file should be:C : Program LONG ... <p> This is an ASCII file , so you should be able to edit it with virtually any text editor ( e.g. Windows Notepad ) . Add the following line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file ) and save the changes . <p> If you have not made previous changes to your Java plug-in policy file you can download the default policy file with the above change added . Right-click here and select " Save Link As " or " Save Target As " , then select the directory where your Java Plug-in policy file is installed . ( the default is C : Program **30;269;TOOLONG ) . <p> Note : A version of the policy file with the required changes is included in the ZIP archive containing the DLL ( discussed above ) . This version is a copy of the default java.policy file created during the Java Plug-in 1.2 installation , with only the policy changes shown ( added at the top of the file ) . <h> javax.comm.SerialPort <p> The ring ( smart card ) reader software relies on javax.comm.SerialPort . The javax.comm.SerialPort assumes ' port discovery ' to be supported on the target platform ( i.e. you ca n't issue commands like " open COM2 " , or " open /dev/ttyR0 " ) . The implementation of javax.comm.SerialPort that uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named port , the Sun implementation may not be . Therefore this demo may only run using the SerialPort implementation of javax.comm.SerialPort . <p> When the Java Plug-in 1.2 runs , the local CLASSPATH setting will be searched first , and if the Sun implementation is found , the demo wo n't run properly . If you have installed the Sun Comm API implementation , you may need to slightly modify your CLASSPATH setting to assure the SerialPort implementation is used . This is normally done by removing the comm.jar entry in CLASSPATH . <p> Note : For software that runs from the local disk ( i.e. not an applet ) the smart card software will search for a file on the local drive called opencard. properties . This file will tell the software what port the reader is on . Because this demo does not require the installation of the smart card software , it needs to force the use of the named port . <p> This applet works best with these versions or later - Netscape Communicator 4.7 , Internet Explorer 5.0 . <p> If you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above steps , click below to run the demo.

@@36964976 @5964976/ <h> Java compatability Note <p> This version was compiled with JDK 1.4.0 . Due to enhancements in JDK 1.4.0 , certain older code may not run as expected when run on older versions of the Java VM ( 1.1.8 in particular ) . If you plan to run on JDK 1.1.8 use the Serialio.jar in the .. /Core/Jars/JDK118 folder . <h> Installation <p> The Java SerialPort tool provides access to the serial ports of the computer allowing you to communicate with barcode readers , modems , mice , printers , sensors , or any serial device . <p> The SerialPort tool should work with any Java Virtual Machine ( VM ) that is compliant with any of the following native method implementations provided we support that platform . <p> The correct version of the shared library ( or DLL ) is loaded dynamically when the SerialPort object is created . <p> The default Serialio and JavaTerm classes are built for use with the JDK 1.1. x . Class files for Java 1.0.2 ( supported on Win32 only ) have also been provided if you 're still using JDK 1.0.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not correctly report an unsatisfied link error when it can not find a DLL . If you launch JavaTerm.exe or use jview JavaTerm and you do not see the JavaTerm GUI window the most likely cause is jview can not find the DLL(s) . Also note that the JavaTerm.exe is- not- a true EXE file and will only run if you have the Microsoft VM installed . <p> Currently , the SerialPort package works with applications or applets . You must remember that to use SerialPort with an applet the applet must be ' trusted ' i.e. digitally signed. - <p> If you purchased a Standard license , then to use SerialPort with a platform other than the one it was initially purchased for , the license for the other platform must be purchased . For Example if you purchase SerialPort for Windows and want to use it on a Linux system , you must purchase the Linux license . If you have a Platform , Professional or Enterprise license , support for multiple platforms is included . <p> - <h> Using Packages <p> Note that SerialPort is ' packaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package rules in order to function properly . If you wish to use SerialPort in a ' unpackaged ' fashion you must purchase the DLL sources and modify them . Microsoft Java note : The Serialio classes are packaged only for Microsoft VM 2. x and later , if you using an ealier VM you will need to comment out the package and import statements in the source code . <h> Building Applets <p> If you are planning to build applets with SerialPort , our Termlet package can be purchased to aid your development . The Termlet package includes step-by-step instructions on how Termlet was created , the source code for Termlet , the supporting build files , and other useful information related to running applets that access the serial ports on the browsers machine . <h> Installation <p> This installation assumes you have installed the JDK ( Java Developer Kit ) , or an equivalent product . <p> Distribution files are packaged in ZIP format ( . zip ) . Use your favorite ZIP tool to unpack the zip files . If you do n't have a ZIP extractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost any platform in existence . For a Windows specific version get an evaluation copy at http : //www.winzip.com . <p> There are in essence two simple steps to the basic install , First install the core JAR , Second install the native library . Some platforms have installers that perform both of these steps . <p> Note : By default , when using the JDK on Windows 2000 the JRE directory is used . If you put the JAR file into C : jdk1.3.1jrelibext you will get **30;330;TOOLONG for the Serialio classes . If you are going to use the Java compiler ( javac ) also put a copy of the JAR into C : jdk1.3.1jrelibext . If you modify the Serialio classes , and do n't want to JAR them each time you test , set the CLASSPATH to include the directory to search for the Serialio files e.g. if the Serialio classes are in C : jspSerialio then the CLASSPATH must include C : jsp ( remember Serialio is a package so JDK looks in the Serialio subdirectory for the classes ) . <p> Note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later is somewhat smarter than with previous JDKs . The classpath override appends the built-in CLASSPATH . For example when you use- java classpath c : jdevjsp , that is the same as- java classpath c : jdk1.2jrelibrt.jar ; c : jdevjsp with JDK 1.2 . <p> Note : If your using- Visual Cafe 4 , this folder would be something like C : VisualCafe4Java2libext . If you installed JDK 1.2.2 on Linux in /usr , the directory would be **25;362;TOOLONG . For Tru64 Unix this would typically be **28;389;TOOLONG . <p> Java 1.1 ( Desktop - Pocket devices differ ) <p> The term $JAVAHOME used hereafter indicates the default directory/folder where Java searches for the classes.zip file . For example , if the JDK 1.1.7 is installed on Windows to the directory c : jdk117 , the default location of $JAVAHOME is C : jdk1.1.7lib . If you install Symantec Visual Cafe PDE to the directory C : VC2PDE , then the default location of $JAVAHOME is C : VC2PDEJavaLib . <p> 1 ) Set CLASSPATH to point to the Serialio JAR . If you have installed SerialPort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the CLASSPATH settingC : **27;419;TOOLONG <p> OR do the following ( this is handy if making changes to Serialio sources ) : <p> 1a ) - Create a directory named Serialio ( case sensitive ) that is a subdirectory of where the main Java classes exist e.g. create the directory C : jdk1.1.7libSerialio . Note : Some Java implementations on Unix variants may require the Serialio files to be placed in the **26;448;TOOLONG directory ( you may need to create $JAVAHOME/classes ) . For Microsoft Java use the CLASSPATH option below , or figure out what the currently used base directory name is for the version of the MS Java VM that your using is and create a directory named Serialio there . At one time this name was- %SystemRoot%JavaClasses where %SystemRoot% is generally C : Windows for Win95/98 and C : WinNT for WinNT . <p> 1b ) If you 're using Java 1.0.2 , choose or create a directory that is in your current CLASSPATH . If your Java development will done in the same directory where the SerialPort files exist , then this directory need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files from the Serialio archive to the directory created in 1a/1b . <p> 3 ) Set you CLASSPATH to- the parent directory- of the Serialio directory used in 1a ) . In this example CLASSPATH should include the following- C : jdk117lib.Note : - Serialio is a package so Java will look for it in the Serialio directory , if you point the CLASSPATH to the Serialio directory where the classes are , the classes wo n't be found because Java will search for them in a subdirectory named Serialio of that directory . <p> Comm API : <p> First install the Serialio.jar as shown above , then follow same instructions as for Serialio.jar above , except use the file jspComm.jar <p> Note : Other tools may install the Sun Comm API JAR file int $JavaLib/ext ( e.g. Dallas Semiconductor 's iSite toolkit ) . Be sure to remove the Sun JAR file when using this implementation ( i.e. in the above example be sure you have c : **26;476;TOOLONG and NOT c : jdk1.2jrelibextcomm.jar . <p> If you are modifying the serialio , or javax.comm.SerialPort source code files it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CLASSPATH instead rebuilding the JAR(s) each time you want to test. - A Caveat with Java2 if you have jspComm.jar in thejrelibext folder and you remove the Serialio.jar file from jrelibext folder , then you will likely get a- **30;504;TOOLONG : **25;536;TOOLONG error- even when you have the proper CLASSPATH setting and the Serialio class files in the proper directory. - Apparently ( at least with JDK 1.2.2 ) you can not have the jspComm.jar in the jrelibext folder and the Serialio classes in a directory on the CLASSPATH . If you want to use the directory method you must have the proper javax.comm classes in the javax.comm directory , and Serialio classes in the Serialio directory . <p> CLASSPATH Notes : <p> If you get an error similar to the following when trying to build the SerialPort classes , your CLASSPATH is probably not set correctly . <p> Depending on what Java platform you 're using you may need to include the current directory in your CLASSPATH statement . The above example installation for Windows would be as follows- CLASSPATH=. ; C : jdk117lib- ( the ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a common mistake to think that the CLASSPATH entry " C : jdk117libclasses.zip " - is the same as- " C : jdk117lib ; " . The functionality of these two entries is not the same- unless you have added all classes existing in the C : jdk117lib directory tree to classes.zip . Java searches the classpath for directory names to match package names , thus for the Serialio package , if it can not find the class(es) in classes.zip it will look in C : jdk117libSerialio . <p> If you wish to put the Serialio files other than the default location ( i.e. $JAVAHOME/lib/Serialio ) be sure to add that location to your classpath . For example if you put the Serialio classes in the C : MyJavaStuffSerialio , you will need to add C : MyJavaStuff to your classpath . <h> Java2 Notes : <p> When using packages , that the CLASSPATH settings may not behave as expected . For example suppose you run the JavaTerm demo using JDK 1.2 ( Java 2 ) and the unpackaged class files ( as the demo is shipped ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jTerm.jar containing all the JavaTerm class files and put this in the jrelibext folder then find that you get an error similar to the following when trying to run JavaTerm . <p> D : Some Folder Not Containing The JavaTerm Classes&gt;java JavaTerm <p> **30;563;TOOLONG : Serialio/SerialPortLocal <p> - - - - - - - at **36;595;TOOLONG <p> - - - - - - - at JavaTerm. &lt;init&gt; ( JavaTerm.java:259 ) <p> - - - - - - - at **32;633;TOOLONG <p> The reason for this is due to CLASSPATH search behavior . The solution in this example is to copy Serialio.jar to the jrelibext folder . <h> Windows CE and Pocket PC 2002 / Sun Personal Java Notes : <p> The pJava CLASSPATH bahavior on WinCE is not the same as the desktop . If you wish to use the SerialPort package for applications that start by double-clicking on the . CLASS file , you need to do one of the following : <p> A ) Create the directory $JDKHOMEClassesSerialio . This is normally " My Handheld PCProgram FilesJavaClassesSerialio " . - This is recommended . <p> B ) Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place the Serialio classes there . Caveat : this way only allows the Serialio classes to be seen from the application directory where Serialio is installed . <p> C ) Copy Serialio.jar to a location of your choice , and modify the registry entry as outlined in the pJava readme file . For example : copy Serialio.jar to- " Program FilesJavalib " - then change the registy setting to : <p> " Program FilesJavabinpjava.exe " -classpath " Program <p> FilesJavalibSerialio.jar " -file " %1 " <p> Note : The SerialPort classes can be obtained by unpacking Serialio.jar or rebuilding the sources . <p> We discovered a bug in pJava beta2 ( which has been reported to Sun , and they say should be fixed in FCS ) where the method System.getProperty ( " os.arch " ) returns " unknown " for both SH3 &amp; SH4 platforms . To use SerialPort on an SH3 or SH4 CPU with beta2 you will need to modify SerialPortLocal.java to force loading the DLL name for your platform e.g.- jspLib = " jspWceSh3 " <h> Native Lib : Windows XP/2K/NT/Me/98/95 <p> There are 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jspWinNm.DLL , jspWinRni.DLL , - jspWinRnia.DLL <p> Only jspWin.DLL is required if your using a JNI compliant VM <p> Win95/Win98/Me : Copy the DLL(s) to the WindowsSystem directory . <p> WinNT/Win2K : Copy the DLL(s) to the WinntSystem32 directory . <p> WinXP : Copy the DLL(s) to the WindowsSystem32 directory . <p> Note : Only one of these DLLs is used depending on what Java vendor/version is running . For example jspWin.DLL provides the JNI support for SerialPort so if you using the Sun JDK or a JNI compliant Java product like Symantec Visual Cafe you only need this DLL . <p> Note : : You can put the DLL can be in any directory if you add that directory to the PATH statement . <p> Netscape Note : If you plan to use SerialPort with a Netscape Communicator applet you will need to put the JNI dll **34;667;TOOLONG folder . <p> If your using Windows Explorer with the default settings you will not be able to see the . DLL files . To see the DLL files with Windows Explorer , verify the following on the- View- panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is checked , 2 ) " Hide file extensions for known file types " is not checked . <p> PATH Notes : <p> Depending on what your system configuration is , you may have multiple Java VMs installed . Be sure your path is set up to find the VM you wish to use first . If for example , if you have Microsoft IE installed , and have also installed the Java VM option , you will have the Microsoft Java VM in your default path . If you then install another VM e.g. JDK1.1.8 , you will need to modify your path to find the Sun VM . For example suppose you install JDK 1.1.8 into C : jdk1.1.8 you would be sure your PATH is set such that C : jdk1.1.8bin comes before your WindowsSystem or WinNTSystem directory . Note also that Java 2 ( JDK1.2.x ) installs a Java.exe in the default Windows directory , so if you wish to use another VM ( say JDK 1.1. x ) you would need to modify your path in a similar fashion . <h> Native Lib : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series 7 , you need to install the JVM on the device . To install the JVM do the following : <p> Insure the Psion connectivity software has been installed from the PsiWin2 CD <p> Connect your Psion device to the PC with the PsiWin2 CD loaded <p> Double-click on the PsiWin2 CD file **26;703;TOOLONG <p> Manual class file install : Create the folder SystemJavaext and copy the Serialio.jar file there . If you do n't wish to use the JAR , then Create the folder **25;731;TOOLONG and copy the class files from Serialio there . If using the CommAPI , follow the same process for jspComm.jar that was done with Serialio.jar . <p> Currently only ARM CPU is supported under EPOC . The DLL is jspEpocArm.dll <p> Unix In General Note : - If things do n't work or if things stop working after an upgrade , be sure to check that file privileges are set properly according to the access your trying to perform . For example : in general , you must install the shared libraries as root , however when doing so , you will typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the SerialPort files . Some upgrades will set file set privileges on all devices to read-only for root , typically you will need to set them for a+rw . For example you could create a script as shown below . Be sure to use the shared library name for your platform . <p> FTP Note : - If you use FTP to transfer shared library files , CLASS , or JAR you MUST use BINARY mode or the resulting files will not work properly . <p> CLASSPATH Note : - On later versions of the JDK ( on Linux at least ) the install is very nice in that you do n't need to set anything to use the JDK , you simply unpack it . Note however the CLASSPATH search does not work identical to that of earlier JDK installs where the CLASSPATH and JAVAHOME settings were required . e.g. If you elected to install the Serialio class files instead of using the Serialio.jar , you might put the Serialio classes into the- JDKHOME/lib- directory , say- jdk117v3/lib/Serialio . If you do this without setting your CLASSPATH to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with earlier versions of the JDK . If you want to use the Serialio.jar file , and your using a JDK1.1.x VM , you can simply add this file to your classpath . For example if you have JDK on- /myStuff/jdk117v3- partition , and you unpack the SerialPort package into the- /jsp- directory add the following to your- . bashprofile <p> Shared Lib location note : - Some Unix Java installations are more ' sensitive ' to the location of the shared lib ( esp Java 2 ) . If you have linkage problems ( i.e. java.library.path error ) put the shared lib- JREHOME/lib/xxx- where xxx is the CPU architecture . For example on Linux x86 with put libjspLux.so.x.y inJREHOME/lib/i386 . Note on later versions of the JDK that support native threads ( e.g.JDK 1.1.7 ) the CPU architecture directory is a symbolic link , so you would put the shared library in the thread model directory of the CPU architecture directory , e.g.- **29;758;TOOLONG . <p> Another example would be on Tru64 Unix using JDK 1.2.2 ( installed to default location ) the shared library would go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one shared library for each platform . There may be more than one . so for a particular platform , use the appropriate version number for the instructions below . <p> Copy the shared library to some folder of your choice , and rename it from . so.x.y , to . so , ( or use symbolic links as Copy the shared library to some directory ( if Java 2 use JREHOME/lib/i386 ) and rename it from . so.x.y , to . so , ( or use symbolic links as shown below ) then export the directory name in the LDLIBRARYPATH environment variable . <p> On- Linux- this would look like this : <p> # ! bin/sh <p> ln -s libjspLux86.so.3.3 libjspLux86.so.3 <p> ln -s libjspLux86.so.3 libjspLux86.so <p> LDLIBRARYPATH=pwd : $LDLIBRARYPATH ; export LDLIBRARYPATH <p> Note : the double link shown is based on the traditional way to link major &amp; minor revisions in Unix . If you want , you can directly link to the shared lib i.e.- ln -s libjspLux86.so.3.3 libjspLux86.so. - or you can simply rename the shared lib to libjspLux86.so <h> Linux Java Plug-in Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netscape 7 . The Termlet demo on the website should also work if your machine is configured properly . <p> 1 ) Install the Java Plug-in . This can be done by selecting the- Complete- install when installing Netscape 7 . <p> Note : If you have the JDK installed on the same machine , the java.policy file of the JDK has no affect on the Java Plug-in for Netscape7 . If you get the following error when running the applet , it is most likely that the ( proper ) java.policy file has not been properly configured . <p> For AIX the shared library must be in the path pointed to by LIBPATH environment variable . The example above becomes : <p> # ! bin/sh <p> ln -s libjspAixPpc.so.2.9 libjspAixPpc.so.2 <p> ln -s libjspAixPpc.so.2 libjspAixPpc.so <p> LIBPATH=pwd : $LIBPATH ; export LIBPATH <p> . bashprofile example- Below is one example of how you could make some the settings in your . bashprofile to take care of CLASSPATH and shared library settings when you login .

Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> export PATH=$JDKHOME/bin : $PATH <p> export CLASSPATH=$JDKHOME/lib : /myData/jdev/JavaTerm <p> alias ' jdev=cd /myData/jdev ' <p> alias ' jterm=cd /myData/jdev/JavaTerm ' <p> LONG ... <p> export LDLIBRARYPATH <h> Macintosh OS 8.5 - 9.2 <p> Apple 's MRJ has now supplanted the variety of Java VMs which once existed on the Macintosh , and the Metrowerks Java VM for Macintosh is no longer supported . If you need to run the Serialio libary with the Metrowerks Java VM , please contact support@serialio.com . <p> The Serialio library for use with MRJ is " jspMacMRJPPC " . The current version number of the library is version 3.5 . It has been tested with Apple 's MRJ 2.2.5 . This library should be placed in the MRJ Libraries folder , which is itself in the Extensions folder . The libraries will be available to the Java VM immediately ; rebooting the computer is not necessary . <h> Macintosh OS X <p> The library file for Mac OS X is named " libjspMacOSX.jnilib " . In most cases , you will want to include this file as part of the application bundle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , all the Serialio software distributions for the Macintosh have a sample project showing one way to do this . You will find the example in the " Projects " folder . More examples can be found in the developer 's section of Apple 's website . This software distribution also includes a file named " Mac OS X notes.html " which has additional tips for developing serial port applications using Mac OS X. <h> Macintosh Port Names <p> On the Mac port names for some devices ( e.g. USB to RS-232 converters ) provide the flexability to name the ports . This could be important if your software was not designed in a flexable way to allow the port name to be specified . If you need this flexability it has been reported that Keyspan model USA-28X B provides it . <h> OS/2 <p> There are 2 DLL 's for OS/2 sccomio.DLL , jspos2j.DLL <p> Copy the DLLs into a directory specified in the LIBPATH setting of the CONFIG.SYS file . Note that " . " is placed in LIBPATH by default when OS/2 is installed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specification has been removed from LIBPATH . <p> The OS/2 COMM DLL is licensed from Oberon Software . <p> Early releases of the IBM JDK 1.1.4 have a bug that causes the VM to report it is running on Window 95 even when running on OS/2 . You will need to modify SerialPortLocal.java such that jspLib = " jspos2j " in the section of code where jspLib is determined . <p> If your using- only- the CommAPI you another option would be to consider the implementation from www.aquilasys.com <h> Java Beans <p> If your using a Java Bean compliant tool like Visual Cafe or JBuilder , you can install the SerialioBean bean in the component library , or tool palette ( or whatever your Java tool calls this ) . Note that the Bean JAR file does not contain the native shared library so the native shared library must be installed as outlined above . <h> JavaTerm Terminal Application <p> JavaTerm- is a terminal application built using the Java SerialPort package . <p> Package Notes <p> Do not change the package name when importing the- Serialio- package into Visual Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import the package with another name . If you do this the application will fail to link properly when calling the SerialPort shared library . 
@@36964980 @5964980/ <h> JavaTerm <p> Submitted by admin on Thu , 07/25/2013 - 07:16 <h> The Terminal Program For All Platforms <h> Version 5.5 <p> There are two sets of CLASS files included with this package ; one set is Java 1.1 compliant ( the default ) and the other is Java 1.0.2 compliant . The SerialPort classes are the same for both VM 's . JavaTerm however uses the AWT , and the event delegation model of Java 1.1 is significantly different from the event model of Java 1.0.2 so the same set of classes does not work . <p> To run JavaTerm from a command line environment , enter the command followed by the device name . e.g.- java JavaTerm COM3. - Or execute the program with no parameters- java JavaTerm . <p> If the device you enter on the command line is in use , you may select a new device using the menu selections- Port Settings . <p> When JavaTerm is shutdown ( using the menu or by closing the main window ) , JavaTerm will save the current port configuration to the file " LastConfig.ser " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously , and you invoke the application without a device name , then JavaTerm will use the last port configuration as the default ( if the file exists in the current directory ) . e.g. If the previous JavaTerm session was using COM3,2400,8,1 then if you enter the command- - - java JavaTerm- ( from the same directory as previously ) this will run JavaTerm with the previous settings . If JavaTerm is killed from the command line using a Control-C the port configuration is not saved . <p> Selecting port names . The port name can be entered into the " Port " text field of the Settings dialog . Some platforms have a ' registry ' of serial ports . When the OS supports this feature , SerialPort displays a " ? " ( pick name ) button to the left of the " Port " TextField . When clicked , the- pick name- button label is changed to " +/- " and the text field changes to a choice control allowing the name of the port to be selected . When clicked again , the- pick name- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing edits to the port name . <p> If you wish to clear the ' receive box ' , click on the ' receive box ' ( to give it keyboard focus ) , and enter Control-X . <p> If you wish to display the current line parameters , toggle the " Send Hex " checkbox . <p> Split handshake ( flow control ) . In the- Settings- dialog when- Handshake- is set to SPLIT , you can select handshake options by clicking on the- In- and- Outcheckboxes . This option allows you to have split handshake configurations for example where hardware flow control is used for the output data , and software flow control is used for the input data . <h> DTR and RTS <p> Some devices ( e.g. some popular modems ) require DTR and/or RTS to be set or they will not communicate with another device. - These settings are often required even if you do not wish to use handshaking ( flow control ) . - If your program does not appear to be working , check that DTR is set to true ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to set RTS to true ) . Does your device work with HyperTerm ( or another terminal program ) but not with JavaTerm , or your SerialPort code ? This could be due to the fact that many of these programs default to setting the DTR line- true- and selecting RTS-CTS handshaking , while SerialPort defaults to having DTR- false- with no handshake . <p> Note that DTR &amp; RTS checkboxes are always enabled . On some platforms changing these may cause unexpected operation depending on the state of the handshake ( flow control ) setting . For example on Win32 changing the state of RTS when RTS-CTS handshake is enabled is defined as ' illegal ' . This definition is not true on all platforms . <h> Carriage Return ( CR ) issues <p> Remember that the- Output CR Filter- option sends a CRLF pair . This allows two version of JavaTerm to ' chat ' , turn this option off if you need to send only CR ( e.g. to log onto some services ) . Some VM implementations do not pass the CR key as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option for this . Some VM implementations send a LF character instead of CR when the- Enter- key is hit . <p> Windows Notes <p> Windows may not properly detect serial ports in use by some device drivers . You may find your device stops working when you start JavaTerm , or select a new port from the settings dialog . For example Windows may problems detecting what port is in use by the Wacom ArtPad driver ( at least through ver 2.55 ) . When this happens you will- not- get a ' port in use ' exception when the port is opened with SerialPort , and you will most likely have to reboot the computer to reset the driver before using the device . <p> Windows NT device names <p> When you use a port that is greater than COM9 and for non-standard serial devices WinNT uses special device naming . For example to open COM10 NT expects the name- " . COM10 " . SerialPort supports these names , but they are not required for version 3.2 and later . To start JavaTerm you may use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also generally applies to other serial device names , for example if your serial device is " MPSerial0A " you may also use the name " . MPSerial0A " to open it . <p> Windows may not properly detect serial ports in use by some device drivers , and Windows may report the device not valid if you try to open a device in use by a device driver . For example if your mouse is on COM1 and you try to use JavaTerm on COM1 it may report " device not valid " . <h> Sun 's Personal Java on WinCE <p> The pJava beta2 will always display a console window when the application outputs data to the console . To avoid this automatic console display when running on WinCE , JavaTerm will redirect the console output to a file named " JTermLog.txt " . <p> Small screens ( e.g. WinCE , EPOC ) <p> When you size the JavaTerm window to less than 300 pixels , or run it on a device with a vertical resolution of less than 300 pixels , it automatically resizes horizontally if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls in the short window . <p> Microsoft Java Notes <p> Microsoft jview ( at least through SDK V1.5.1 ) does not correctly report an unsatisfied link error if it can not find a DLL . If you start JavaTerm.exe and you do not see the JavaTerm GUI window the most likely cause is JavaTerm can not find the DLL(s) . There is also an apparent bug with MS JDK 1.0 where it requires the entry DLL to be in the current directory . If you have MS JDK1.0 the best way to run this demo is to put all the DLLs in the current directory . <p> The default capture is stored in C : Capture.dat instead of the current folder . This allows the file to be selected quickly using the EPOC file browser . <p> When run on EPOC , the Port Settings dialog will show a checkbox labeled " Disable Active Link " . When selected , this will close an active ' link to desktop ' . When done using the port , the link will be enabled again . When not selected , JavaTerm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Link is active " ( this is the default ) . <p> Unix Notes <p> Some Unix devices have strange indexing for multiple ports . The JavaTerm settings dialog allows selection of device names based on an index number when clicking on the buttons labeld " + " and " - " . This will only work if the device name is indexed such that multiple devices only modify the end of the device name ( this is the most common case ) . For example a device that indexes as /dev/ttyS0 , /dev/ttyS1 will work , a device that indexes as /dev/tty0p0 , /dev/tty1p0 will not . You can still use JavaTerm with these ports , but you will have to enter the device name . <p> Linux <p> Some versions of JDK may not align JavaTerm checkbox labels to the left . This issue has been observed on Linux JDK1.1.3 . <p> SGI Irix Mips <p> With some versions of IRIX and the SGI JDK running on 64 bit CPU 's , you may need to invoke the MIPS ABI options . For example to use the MIPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devName . <p> Macintosh Notes <p> To run JavaTerm double-click on the file " JavaTerm " or " JavaTerm Comm API " . The " JavaTerm " demo is implemented using the SerialPort API while the " JavaTerm Comm API " demo is implemented using the javax.comm.SerialPort API . <p> The " JavaTerm " demo defaults to using the port named " Modem Port " , which exists only on older Macs with built-in serial ports . If you want to use a port with a different name , use the- pick name- button as explained above . <p> To reveal the names of the your serial ports , you can also use a utility application such as the freeware " PortPeek " which can be downloaded from the Megawolf , Inc. website- ( http : //www.megawolf.com ) <p> It is possible to run multiple instances of either of the JavaTerm application by using Apple 's MRJ 2.2 . You must first make a copy of the JavaTerm application using the Duplicate function in the Finder . Then , you can launch both copies and use one to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two serial ports . <p> If the two copies of the application in the same folder , they always start-up trying to use the same serial port . To avoid this conflict , move each application to a separate folder . Each copy will save separate preferences for the port settings and also the window location . <p> OS/2 Notes <p> For OS/2 use the command java JavaTerm . Output from System.out will show up in the original command line window . If a specific Java console is desired , set the environment variable JAVACONSOLE=1 before running java . <p> If you want to use the " Run Java Program " or " Run Java PM Program " icons in the " Java for OS/2 " folder , there are two requirements . First place the required class files in a directory specified by CLASSPATH , then place the DLLs in a directory ( other than " . " ) specified by LIBPATH . Following these configurations , when the icon is double clicked , it will prompt for a parameter which should be entered as WinTerm . <p> IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report it is running on Windows 95 even when running on OS/2 . If you want to use IBM JDK 1.1.4 you will need to make a simple change to the SerialPort Java source code to account for IBM 's bug . <h> javax.comm API <p> In addition to the very popular JavaTerm product , we also include a version that runs using the javax.comm API . This code will work with our implementation , or another implementation that is compliant with the javax.comm specification . Note that there are some problems with the javax.comm ( at least with release 2.0 ) so to use our JavaTerm product with an implementation other than ours you may need to make some slight modifications . For example the comm API assumes that a RTS signal exists in the system and since this is not always true you may see some exceptions when run on a platform that does not support these ( e.g. the Mac ) . The Solutions Consulting implementation uses the SerialPort API to implement the javax.comm API , and has dealt with these issues internally allowing the identical code to run on all platforms .

" testimonials . <p> People frequently ask if SerialPort provides support for javax.comm.SerialPort . Yes , absolutely . This information will help you determine if you wish to use the superior SerialPort API directly , or the javax.comm.SerialPort API . SerialPort provides maximum flexibility ( evident by the fact that javax.comm.SerialPort is implemented entirely using SerialPort ) . The SerialPort API was shipping commercially for about 18 months before Sun introduced javax.comm.SerialPort . As diagrammed below , the Serialio.com implementation of javax.comm.SerialPort was built completely using the SerialPort API and is based on the Comm API 2.0 ( the first release in spite of the version number ) . <p> " I always select the SerialPort API over javax.comm.SerialPort whenever I have a choice . The javax.comm API is difficult to setup and to use ... " testimonials . <p> The SerialPort API is so efficient that in initial benchmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running on Windows . <h> Benefits unique to the SerialPort API <p> SerialPort provides a very flexible solution , and provides a consistent API across all devices . <p> Did you know you may have to code your solution twice ? <p> javax.comm.SerialPort API and CommConnection API note <p> If you use javax.comm.SerialPort you may have to recode your solution if you want to run it on MIDP . If you use CommConnection , you may have to recode your solution to run on a non-MIDP environment . If you code your solution with the SerialPort API , use the same code on both MIDP , and non-MIDP environments . <p> The original SerialPort design was robust enough to port to J2ME MIDP on WME . Developers using the SerialPort API , can use the same powerful API for all their target devices , from Super Computer class , to MIDP class devices . The javax.comm API design is insufficient for such flexibility ; therefore the CommConnection interface was developed to replace javax.comm on MIDP . The CommConnection API is even more restrictive than the javax.comm.SerialPort API , and requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its design . <p> **javax.comm.CommPort provides the method enableReceiveTimeout , however does NOT provide the parity method enableTransmitTimeout . This means that threads that transmit data using javax.comm.SerialPort , can potentially lockup . This can occur for example , when hardware flow control is selected , but no hardware is present , or the client has flow control disabled indefinitely . <h> JavaPOS Support <h> Limitations of Comm API 2.0 design <p> When Sun released the first early version of the Comm API Solutions Consulting implemented that API using SerialPort and reported these design problems with the API . Many of the issues reported were apparently ignored by Sun , as those issues still remain with the Comm API in the initial release ( long after the issues were reported ) . <p> There should be some way to determine if some set/is ? ? ? , and notifyOn ? ? ? API methods are supported . The SerialPort product does this with the ' isSupported ' methods . Since the Comm API does not provide this feature , it should at least define some of the methods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have DSR or RTS hardware so isDSR and setRTS make absolutely no sense on the Mac . Likewise , notifyOnCD , and notifyOnRingIndicator make no sense on the Mac . When using our javax.comm.SerialPort implementation on a platform that does not support one of these features ( e.g. setDTR on UnixWareIA32 ) a message similar to the one shown below will appear on the console : <p> The correct thing to do is to throw an <p> **33;1113;TOOLONG however Sun 's API does <p> not define this . For source code compatibility with Sun 's <p> API we can not do it the correct way . You should contact <p> Sun and encourage them to fix their API . ( We suggested <p> they do this in early 1998 ) <p> It also seems odd that methods like setDTR , setRTS , and sendBreak are not declared to throw an IOExcepion . <p> Note that the Comm API defines isDTR and isRTS methods . From the serial hardware level , these signals are write-only , so these methods can be misleading . In addition these methods make no sense on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for polling ( or to disable event generation ) . For many applications this is not a problem , however for some high-performance applications the overhead of event creation/propagation can be limiting . Note also that some platforms may not provide a mechanism to generate interrupts for all of the events defined in the Comm API . This means that a thread must be dedicated to polling at the Java level to generate the required events . <p> Dynamic port configuration is a questionable cross-platform strategy . In the Comm API when the methods setSerialPortParams and setFlowControlMode are called , the driver must reconfigure an open port . Performing port configuration changes without resetting the port can be risky since some OS 's do not support the concept , or can have subtle bugs associated with it . ( This is one of the reasons the Solutions Consulting SerialPort API uses the SerialConfig object ) <p> The file name **38;1148;TOOLONG is too long for the Mac file system . <p> The Solutions Consulting SerialPort product has none of these limitations . In fact our implementation of the Comm API is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using SerialPort the developer is provided with maximum flexibility since the Comm API or the SerialPort API can be used . <h> Is it 100% Java ? <p> It is unfortunate , but there seems to be much confusion about what 100% Pure Java means . One of the requirements to be 100% pure is that classes do not contain native methods . Since native methods are required to implement the Java Virtual Machine ( VM ) this in effect means that Java itself is not 100% Pure . Only applications can be 100% pure Java . Classes for doing things like communicating with serial ports can not be 100% pure , however this does not mean that applications that use these classes can not be 100% pure . Many 100% pure Java applications/applets have been written that use the SerialPort product . <p> Sun has said that the Comm API provides a Java extension API that allows applications that use the Comm API to be certified as 100% pure . Implementations of the Comm API are not 100% pure and thus the Comm API implementations from Sun are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unfortunate confusion since many people tend to think if it comes from Sun it is 100% pure . In summary , applications that use implementations of the Comm API should at some future time be capable of being labeled 100% pure , implementations themselves can not be 100% pure . Currently even applications that use the Comm API can not be 100% pure because Sun has not provided the specs for testing to KeyLabs ( the company that does 100% Java certification ) . <p> Note : Using the Comm API 2.0 release your application may in the future be able to be 100% pure , however it will be less cross-platform compatible than an application written using the SerialPort API . This is due to the above listed design issues with the Comm API release 2.0 . <h> Installation <p> Install SerialPort per instructions . SerialPort must be installed for the Comm API to function . <p> Update any Serialio files included with the Comm API package ( e.g. SerialPortLocal.java , SerInputStream.java ) and rebuild the Serialio class file(s) . <p> Here are two common ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAR file as follows : <p> 1 ) Add the jspComm.jar file to the CLASSPATH . For example on Windows if you have jspComm.jar in c : jsp then CLASSPATH= ; c : jspjspComm.jar ; <p> Or do it this way if you have the separate classes : <p> 1 ) Create a directory named javax.comm ( case sensitive ) that is a subdirectory of where the main Java Comm API classes will exist e.g. on Windows create the directory C : jspjavaxcomm <p> 2 ) Copy the Comm API class files into the directory created in 1 ) . <p> 3 ) Add the parent directory of the javax.comm directory to the CLASSPATH . For this example on Windows CLASSPATH= ; c : jsp ; <h> Port enumeration <p> Note enumeration requires that the OS provide some type of registry ' functionality , this is not provided on all platforms . The Solutions Consulting implementation is very flexible in that it provides the developer the direct ability to add ports in case the developer does not wish to rely on enumeration . This is done as follows : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , " /dev/tty1 " , " Modem Port " ) . Note that the Driver parameter is set to null . This indicates you simply want to add a name to the list , and use the the default ( Solutions Consulting ) driver . <p> You can see an example of this in the Comm API version of TermTest.java . <p> You can also hard code device names into the list by modifying JSPDriver.java . <h> Events <p> The term event is misleading in this context . Those who have worked with serial ports at the UART level might immediately think that this means these would be hardware interrupt driven . This certainly makes sense , if the platform serial port drivers supported such an interface , unfortunately many do not . Even for those platforms that do provide some event type of event interface there is no guarantee that the driver itself is not polling the hardware . <p> Although we have no access to Sun 's implementation of javax.comm , it is our belief that this implmentation is similar to ours in that it has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you dump out Sun 's comm.jar ( jar -tvf comm.jar ) you will see this class : <p> **37;1188;TOOLONG <p> If you dump out jspComm.jar in SerialPort you will see this class : <p> **36;1227;TOOLONG <p> We believe that these are functionally equivalent . As for performance , our last test showed the implementation provided with SerialPort was about 2% faster than Sun 's on WinNT . Considering the implementation we provide , sits on top of the SerialPort API , this is quite good . So even if we are wrong , and Sun has gone to great links to use ' events ' in Win32 ( i.e. Overlapped IO ) then our polling strategy is still faster . As for polling directly with the SerialPort API ( i.e. doing essentially what javax.comm.SeralPort does , but directly in the application ) SerialPort will happily run 96 port ( or more ) on a single machine . <h> Polling is very efficient when done properly . <p> The fact is polling can be more efficient than the event model provided by the javax.comm especially for fast changing events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JNI interface call , a JVM system call , memory allocation ( which may create additional overhead by creating more work for the garbage collector ) , then the event must be posted ( in javax.comm , this is a method call to the listener ) . In the polling scenario there is only a method call from the JVM to the native driver . <h> Example code <p> All the serial port example code that ships with the 2.0 release of the Comm API . Has been tested with the Solutions Consulting implementation . Depending on your VM , when you run the SimpleWrite.java example you may need to use CTL-C to stop the program . You can avoid this by adding the following one line of code to SimpleWrite.java where the code exits . <p> System.exit(1) ; //proper exit <p> Sun 's SerialDemo example : Note when using this example program it may appear that it will not work when trying to communicate with a modem . This is NOT a problem with Solutions Consulting javax.comm.SerialPort implementation . There are two issues here . First some modems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set , since SerialDemo does not provide a hook to set DTR your modem will not send a reply . Secondly , if you note that SerialDemo works with your modem on JDK 1.1. x , but not JDK 1.2. x , then this is an issue of a change that Sun made to the way the Enter key event is handled . In JDK 1.2. x the Enter key does not send the CR , and the modem will not respond until it sees a CR . You should use JavaTerm not SerialDemo , as JavaTerm provides smart and flexible CR control as well as the ability to set DTR . <h> Example code <p> All the serial port example code that ships with the 2.0 release of the Comm API . Has been tested with the Solutions Consulting <h> Implementation Requirements &amp; Limitations <p> Split flow control ( handshake ) is not supported for SerialPort versions previous to 3.2 . <p> Parallel ports are not currently supported ( Parallel ports do n't even exist on many of the platforms that SerialPort runs on ) <p> Port enumeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Port enumeration is currently supported on **32;1265;TOOLONG , Mac OS X &amp; OS/2 , and only on JNI compliant VM 's . This feature requires jspWin.dll version 3.7 or later on Win32 and shared library version 2.8 or later on Mac , and 3.2 or later on OS/2 . <p> When an array of bufsize is defined , and when InputStream.read(buf) is used , Sun 's implementation will return immediately after reading the available bytes ( regardless of the size ) . Our implementation will block until size bytes are available ( this is the most logical behaviour ) . If you want to prevent blocking use **30;1299;TOOLONG and pass the rdyCnt returned to the InputStream.read ( buf , off , len ) method where len=rdyCnt.

@@36965128 @5965128/ 187174 @qwx387174 <h> Aerial Tram NFC Attendance Solution at OHSU <p> - <p> - <p> - <h> - <h> BRIEF <p> Oregon Health and Science University ( OHSU ) features a unique and exciting way to get to campus -- the Portland Aerial Tram . Thousands of student , faculty , and staff rely on it every day . But the tram 's popularity and efficiency also created a potential problem : How do you meet the transportation needs- of the university when the tram is out of commission ? - Before they could even start to solve this issue , OHSU needed to know who rode the tram and at what time . To get this data , OHSU worked with Serialio to implement a Cloud-in-Hand Solution that leveraged the HID iClass RFID-NFC technology in the campus I 'd badges . <p> - <h> - <h> THE CUSTOMER <p> Oregon Health &amp; Science University is the state 's only academic health center . It provides an uncommon array of services from providing the state 's most comprehensive healthcare , to educating the next generation of clinicians and biomedical researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 full-time students and trainees as well as - 2,743 full-time faculty members . - Of those students , trainees , and faculty , approximately 60 to 80 percent regularly use the OHSU transit system which includes the aerial trams. - <p> - <h> - <h> THE CHALLENGE <p> For five weeks in 2018 , the aerial trams will be closed for scheduled maintenance and servicing . OHSU will provide alternate transportation during that time but to ensure adequate resources were secured , they needed to know three things : how many would be riding , at what time , and what was the destination . All OHSU student and faculty can ride the tram for free simply by showing their I 'd badge . So how do you get this data ? - <p> To further complicate the project , over 10,000 people ride the tram each weekday , loading through large , open-air terminals . So any process that slowed down operations would be unacceptable . <h> - <h> THE SOLUTION <p> The most efficient solution was determined to be Serialio.com mobile RFID attendance solution with readers at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty and students with an I 'd badge that features HID iClass- technology . As people walked through the terminal , tram staff instructed users to tap the I 'd badge at the kiosk . The idChamp RS3 features a high-quality , dual-frequency RFID-NFC engine allowing for quick and easy scanning and thus avoiding any bottlenecks or delays. - <p> The Cloud-In-Hand- Mobile Attendance application records the iClass I 'd , a timestamp , and a unique identifier for the kiosk . The kiosk would automatically upload the information to Cloud-in-Hand.com where the scans from all 8 kiosks would be collated into a daily report delivered automatically to the OHSU Transportation Services team . From there , OHSU was able to correlate the data with their existing access control database to not only analyze the usage pattern of the daily riders but also understand which departments the riders worked in , thereby providing a complete picture of each riders ' transportation needs- <p> With this information in hand , OHSU can now devise an effective strategy for providing alternate transportation during the scheduled maintenance and ensure smooth operations. -
