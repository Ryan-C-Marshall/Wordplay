Saul 's third season wrapped up Sunday night . <p> We do n't know if Better Call Saul will undershoot or overshoot the five-season-arc of its predecessor . We do n't even know , at this writing , that it will definitely get a fourth season ( spoiler : it will definitely get a fourth season ) , as AMC has yet to announce the pick-up . <p> But comparing where Walter White and Jimmy McGill find themselves along their respective downward trajectories as of the three-season mark helps to clarify the two shows ' shared narrative DNA " and to underscore their stark differences . <p> Walter White , Three Seasons In <p> By the end of " Full Measure , " Breaking Bad 's season-three finale , Byran Cranston 's Walter White was not yet The One Who Knocks . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead And Asks Sort of Menacingly If He Could Pop By And Get A Few Minutes Of Your Time . <p> Oh sure , he 'd violently murdered four people , ordered the killing of another , and was responsible for the death of many more , both through action ( unleashing a prohibitively addictive drug upon the population ) and inaction ( failing to save the life of a young woman , whose death indirectly led to a massive airline disaster " look , it 's a long story ) . <p> But after three seasons ( a total of 33 episodes ) , Walter White was still convincing himself that his criminal career was a means to an end , a last-ditch gambit to provide for his family after his death . Throughout season three , he regularly displayed flashes of the imperious , proud and inflexible crime-lord he would become " particularly in his sneering , tetchily dismissive treatment of Aaron Paul 's Jesse Pinkman " but Cranston also took pains to let the mild-mannered chemistry teacher 's roots show . The actor was still leaning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desperate , overmatched by the forces swirling around him . <p> There is no game-changing moment , no turning point , that transforms White into Heisenberg . That 's the show 's strength . Scene to scene , episode to episode , there is a constant push and pull . But the thing about " two steps forward , one step back " is that , over time , it will get you where you 're going . And we all know where Walter White is going . <p> In " Full Measure " ' s first act , the White who meets with drug-lord Gus Fring ( Giancarlo Esposito ) in the middle of the New Mexico desert is calm rational , and in control . It 's an act , yes " White is assuming the mask of a man who can discuss , with a cool , scientific detachment , the very real possibility that Fring will murder him , there on that spot . <p> In the episode 's final act , White adopts another mask " that of a man blindly panicking that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehrmantraut ( Jonathan Banks ) . But with a phone call to Pinkman , in which he dispatches his partner to murder a colleague ( David Costabile 's placid Gale ) , the mask slips , and in that devious , victorious smirk , we see the face of Heisenberg . <p> Many more heinous acts lie in his future , over the next two seasons . But this is the man he will become , the man who knows himself thoroughly " who knows , as he will finally admit with pride in the series finale , that he did what he did because " I liked it . I was good at it . I was alive . " <p> Saul , Midway On The Road To Damascus <p> The Jimmy McGill of the first three seasons of Better Call Saul has a lot in common with the Saul of Breaking Bad . He 's clever , he 's voluble and he 's an inveterate cutter of corners . <p> When we learn of his past as a small-time con-man and perennial screw-up , it does n't surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of Saul 's very particular set of skills came from . We also see that Jimmy McGill is deeply conversant with the law , and its sundry loopholes . That checks out , too . <p> What we conspicuously have n't seen , in these first three seasons , is evidence of the very worst aspects of Breaking Bad 's Saul " his coarseness , his unapologetic sliminess , and his blithe ability to recommend , for example , that murdering a witness represents an efficient way to avoid sticky legal trouble . <p> That 's because for these first three seasons of Better Call Saul , Jimmy McGill has had three things outside of himself to care about , and care about deeply : Chuck ( Michael McKean ) , his withholding older brother , Kim ( Rhea Seehorn ) , his partner in life and law practice , and his surprising " and surprisingly sincere " passion for elder law . <p> Each of these three aspects of Jimmy 's life ground him in an existence devoted to the service of others . With the season three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are severed forever . <p> Jimmy 's life has been shaped by Chuck in uncountable ways . He 's lived in his brother 's shadow , even " especially " when he fought to escape it with a career as a scam artist . He 's striven for Chuck 's approval , following him into the law profession " an act that only served to incur Chuck 's abiding disgust . And when Chuck succumbed to a debilitating condition , Jimmy dutifully assisted him , because to do anything else was not something Jimmy , as we know him , could imagine . <p> The perennially strained relationship reached its breaking point this season , and Jimmy 's last-minute attempt to salvage it in the season finale only earned him an emotional disemboweling from which he 'll never recover . Chuck wo n't be around to apologize , much less grant Jimmy the brotherly and professional approval and attention he 's craved for so long . Jimmy will also spend the rest of the show 's run dealing with the knowledge that all his selfless efforts on Chuck 's behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy 's attempts to work his way into the lives " and wills " of the elderly residents of Albuquerque , we naturally regarded it in the context of his past as a scammer . But we soon came to appreciate the surprising fact " which likely surprised Jimmy , too " that there was something more than smarm to his relationships with these men and women ( well , women , mostly ) . He had their best interests at heart . And he was good at it . <p> All of that , too , came to an abrupt and shattering end in Sunday 's season finale . <p> Better Call Saul , Season 4 : It 's All About Kim <p> Without Chuck or the residents of Sandpiper to counter his worst instincts , Jimmy McGill 's preordained descent into the moral bankruptcy of Breaking Bad 's Saul Goodman can only accelerate . How quickly this happens over the rest of the show 's life , be it one season , two , or ( please no ) more , depends entirely upon Kim . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these first three seasons , a fact around which the rest of the show 's run will likely revolve . Unlike Chuck , who understands Jimmy but regards him with disdain , or the Sandpiper clients , who see only the unctuous mask Jimmy puts on , Kim alone sees him for who he is , and accepts him . Loves him , even . <p> There are signs of stress in that relationship lately , which over the next season or so can only lead to fissures , and collapse . On the Better Call Saul Insider podcast , an episode-by-episode , behind-the-scenes discussion with the show 's cast and crew , Seehorn , Odenkirk and show creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould have all half-jokingly asserted that it 's perfectly conceivable for the Saul of Breaking Bad to still be together with Kim , even though we never saw her during that show 's run . <p> It may be conceivable , but it 's not possible . <p> The Breaking Bad Saul Goodman is not a good man . There 's none of the interior conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which only makes sense " Saul Goodman is a secondary character , tasked with advancing the plot and delineating Walter White as a protagonist . But Jimmy McGill is a primary character , rounded and real , with nuances that keep us watching " and guessing . <p> For one to become the other , those nuances , those conflicts , have to get papered over , or swallowed , or discarded . And Kim , for her part , believes in Jimmy McGill , but she 'd never believe in Saul Goodman . Which is why the story that remains to be told on the remaining episodes of Better Call Saul is , in a very real sense , Kim 's story .

Some of that is biological matching , blood type , for example , or maybe size . And some of that is priority based on that algorithm . . . We work in critically short time periods . <p> Dr. Fred Gordon : <p> The list for liver donation is set up by something called the MELD ( model of end-stage- liver disease ) score . This is a mathematical calculation that uses four blood results . . . and what the score actually tells you is a three-month prediction of survival without a liver transplant .

However , after a few years of monitoring , he suddenly became very i 'll , and was put on the transplant list , at which point Shannon donated a portion of her liver to him . When that ultimately did not work , Derek was put at the top of the transplant list , because his MELD score was high , and he received a non-living donation 28 days later .

While Hepatitis might have been ruled out years ago , it most certainly is not today . And in fact , I can tell you here in New England , we routinely recover donated organs from individuals who are Hepatitis positive . However , there are protocols underway now to expand that to candidates waiting who are Hepatitis negative . The reason why is because there has been so much advancement in treatment and cures in some instances of Hepatitis that the transmission of that disease as a risk for a candidate waiting for a transplant really pales in comparison of their potential risk of dying. - <p> What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In an instance where a willing living donor may be incompatible with the individual they would like to donate their kidney to , the concept is relatively simple . . .

They have committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border areas . It 's been difficult for them to be able to penetrate as deep into Iran as into Tehran . <p> And of course , there 's also the Iranian terrorist organization Mujahedin-e Khalq , who has committed acts of this kind in the past , certainly have the capacity of pulling off things of this magnitude and who has a much easier time penetrating deep into Iran than any of these other groups have , precisely because of local knowledge , linguistic skills , et cetera . <p> INSKEEP : Is n't this a remarkable moment of pressure on Iran ? They 're facing pressure from multiple sides , it would seem . <p> PARSI : There is a remarkable moment of pressure in the region as a whole . In some ways , I would say Iran is under less pressure than it was five years ago . Five years ago , it did n't have the relations with the Europeans that it does today . The nuclear deal was still a very , very significant international crisis . <p> INSKEEP : The sanctions were underway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is now starting to change , and certainly the relationship with Europe is very , very different today . But the region is under a tremendous amount of pressure . And we see how the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran has really escalated in the last couple of months . <p> We 've seen how President Trump 's trip there seems to have at least been read by the Saudis as a green light to go forward with a lot of things that they probably would n't have done , such as the escalation with Qatar that we saw yesterday . <p> INSKEEP : Would you explain what that has to do with Iran ? When we - when we hear that Saudi Arabia and other nations cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar there in the Persian Gulf , why is that involve - why does that involve Iran ? <p> PARSI : It 's not entirely clear if it 's linked to Iran . But there certainly seems to be one reason to believe that it could be . We 've seen that the Qataris have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> INSKEEP : Friendlier . <p> PARSI : Much friendlier . And in fact , a lot of the Arab states feel that the Saudis are obsessed with Iran , and they do n't share that obsession . They may see Iran as a threat . They may see Iran as a negative actor . But the degree of obsession we 're seeing in Riyadh is quite unique . And the Saudis are very annoyed with that because Qatar has Al Jazeera , and as a result they can challenge ... 
@@37206180 @6206180/ <p> Justin Welby , the archbishop of Canterbury , seen at a news conference last year . The Anglican spiritual leader says the Church of England " colluded " with one of its former bishops to hide the bishop 's sexual abuse of boys and young men . <p> Frank Augstein / AP <p> Originally published on June 22 , 2017 2:09 pm <p> When faced with allegations of sex abuse against one of its bishops , the Church of England " colluded and concealed rather than seeking to help those who were brave enough to come forward , " the church 's leader acknowledged Thursday . <p> " For the survivors who were brave enough to share their story and bring Peter Ball to justice , I once again offer an unreserved apology , " Justin Welby , archbishop of Canterbury , said in a statement . " There are no excuses whatsoever for what took place and the systemic abuse of trust perpetrated by Peter Ball over decades . " <p> Welby was responding to the findings of an independent investigation into how the church handled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 to indecent assault against young men . That report , also released Thursday , found that Ball " abused many boys and men over a period of twenty years or more . " <p> " That is shocking in itself but is compounded by the failure of the Church to respond appropriately to his misconduct , again over a period of many years , " Moira Gibb , who led the investigation , said in the report . " Ball 's priority was to protect and promote himself and he maligned the abused . The Church colluded with that rather than seeking to help those he had harmed , or assuring itself of the safety of others . " <p> The report goes on to lay out its extensive evidence against the 85-year-old Ball , who served a prison sentence of just over a year and was released on probation in February . The " harrowing " report " in Welby 's words " details how investigators say Ball would use the trappings of his office to his advantage : <p> " He had a well worn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom boys and young men . His abuse was charged with religious intensity . The men we interviewed spoke of how he ' exploited the significance , particularly within the Anglo Catholic tradition , of ritual ' . For Ball religious rites became ' a mask for abuse , and theology ( was ) used as a way of justifying abuse ' . The evil of what he did was ' compounded by his message that this made the victims more special and more holy ' . " <p> But nearly as damning is the report 's assessment of Lord Carey , former archbishop of Canterbury . Investigators say Carey was warned repeatedly about Ball 's actions but failed to act on them appropriately . <p> What 's more , the report states , " Lord Carey played the lead role in enabling Ball 's return to ministry " after Ball was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault in the early 1990s " " that was not a decision taken by anyone else . " <p> " This is inexcusable and shocking behaviour and although Dame Moira notes that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not think that the Church now would conduct itself in the ways described we can never be complacent , we must learn lessons , " Welby said in his statement . <p> According to Welby , that includes endorsing the report 's 11 recommendations centered on supporting survivors and reinforcing disciplinary measures . <p> " For the survivors , it may feel this is all too late , " Peter Hancock , the church 's lead bishop on safeguarding , said in a statement . " I am personally aware from my meetings with individual survivors in the course of my work that they live with the effects of this abuse for their whole life . I once again offer them my wholehearted apology . " <p> He added : " It has taken longer than it should have done , but we are absolutely committed to implementing Dame Moira 's recommendations and my role as lead bishop is to ensure this happens .

@@37206181 @6206181/ <p> And now it 's time for the Barbershop . That 's where we sit down with a group of interesting people to talk about what 's in the news and what 's on their minds . Joining us for our shape-up this week are Susan Chira of The New York Times . She 's a senior correspondent and editor and is reporting now on gender issues . She 's with us from our New York studios . Hi , Sue . <p> SUSAN CHIRA : Hey , Michel . <p> MARTIN : Eric Deggans is NPR 's TV critic . He joins us from St. Petersburg , Fla . Eric , thank you so much for joining us . <p> ERIC DEGGANS , BYLINE : Hey . <p> MARTIN : And NPR editor Ahmad Omar . He edits this program . Ahmad , thanks for taking four steps down the hall to come into the studio . <p> MARTIN : At least you did n't need directions , right ? So as we talked about this earlier this hour , after five days of deliberations , a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian Bill Cosby drugged and assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004 . And as we heard , the district attorney says that he 's going to retry the case . But there 's so much to talk about now . <p> And , Susan , you 've been writing about this for The New York Times . And you pointed out that all this is taking place when allegations of sexual assault or harassment have touched Fox News , the Trump campaign , you might even say both political campaigns if you consider the way the Trump campaign brought back up with the questions about Bill Clinton 's conduct , then there 's Uber , all the incidents on college campuses . <p> And you said that in a way , the Cosby trial was also a trial about how society grapples with the combustible questions of power , predation and due process that complicate he-said-she-said narratives . And you said that the jury is still out . But as a person who follows this closely , I 'm wondering if you feel you learned anything from this latest chapter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I learned a lot about the real tension between the issues of how you fairly establish credibility and what the line is when you believe women , when you do n't , what memory does when you 're trying to recall events preceding around and after sexual assault and why it 's really hard according to legal experts to successfully prosecute cases that are he-said-she-said cases . <p> What 's interesting about this one is that , as people said in the program preceding , there have been so many other women who have accused Bill Cosby of a similar M.O . but only one case was admitted to trial . And that 's because a lot of people argued that a lot of these accusations were settled , they were n't proven . To introduce them might be prejudicial . There are all kinds of legal challenges . And they 're all kinds of questions about who we believe and why . <p> MARTIN : Ahmad , you know , I think that - people might think this happened in part because of the high-profileness ( ph ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clouded people 's judgment or at least affected people 's judgment . You know , you 've been reporting on that . Do you think that that might be so ? <p> OMAR : Well , actually , our colleague David Schaper , who we heard from earlier , he 's done some reporting on this this week on all these cases . And the reporting that he did kind of indicates that it 's not really about the high-profile nature . <p> And about 3 to 6 percent of cases - criminal cases - end up hung . And the biggest issue really is evidence being closely balanced . In other words , neither side really has a slam dunk . So that 's the biggest predicting factor . And they do n't really see evidence of high-profile cases being more susceptible to this sort of thing . <p> MARTIN : You know , Eric , what do you think about this ? I mean , given that , you know , the whole question of the celebrity factor and also what Susan was writing about , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , what are your thoughts about it ? <p> DEGGANS : Well , I think we 're seeing two different things happen here . One thing that 's interesting to me about Cosby is that this all - this stuff all became public , like , almost 10 years ago . Andrea Constand made her allegations when this act supposedly happened in 2004 and then sued him in 2005 . And several women came forward then . There was reporting done on it . And then we all got cultural amnesia about it or something , and people forgot that it happened . <p> And then when Hannibal Burress , a comic , joked about it in a viral video just a few years ago , it brought it all back , pulled everything back into public view . And we had a very different reaction to it . And so what 's interesting to me is that now that these allegations have come forward in a different time , there 's much more belief accorded to the women who are making these allegations . <p> Women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago to tell their stories . And - but all of that , I think , is weighted against - it 's obvious there are a lot of people who still want to believe Bill Cosby . And even now , you know , I 've talked to some people , some journalists - columnists , rather - who are skeptical and think , you know , is this some way of bringing down a successful black man at the end of his career ? So I do think celebrity is having an impact on this . <p> MARTIN : You know , talk about another thing that kind of is part of the cultural moment . There was another story in the news this week , this one from Capitol Hill . There was a high-profile Senate intelligence committee hearing where Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified . And this was the moment that kind of lit up social media . Here it is . Let 's play that clip . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF HEARING ) <p> KAMALA HARRIS : Sir , I 'm not asking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be asked these questions ... <p> JEFF SESSIONS : Well , I 'm unable to answer the question . <p> HARRIS : ... And you would rely on that policy , did you not ask your staff to show you the policy that would be the basis for your refusing to answer the majority of questions that have been asked of you ? <p> JOHN MCCAIN : Chairman , the witness should be allowed to answer the question . <p> RICHARD BURR : Senators will allow the chair to control the hearing . Senator Harris , let him answer . <p> MARTIN : Now that , of course , was California Senator Kamala Harris , Democrat , being cut off by Republican Senators John McCain and Richard Burr . Now , what I think got a lot of people 's attention is the fact that this is the second time that Senator Harris had been cut off by her colleagues and also that male colleagues had interrupted the witness who had not been admonished by the chair . <p> So , you know , Sue , you wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Uber . You 've actually done extensive reporting on this about who gets to interrupt who , so why do n't you tell us what you have to say about that ? <p> CHIRA : Well , let 's just say social media lit up because there is n't a woman possibly that I 've ever talked to in my entire life who has n't experienced being cut off by a man . And this is a universal experience . And what I wanted to do was find out , is this gut feeling that this happens to us all the time real ? And I started doing some research into what studies had been done . <p> And I found that , in fact , there 's a lot of academic research that affirms this experience that a lot of women know and feel . And a number of researchers have actually looked at things like minutes of school board meetings , or they assembled actual decision-making experimental groups , groups of five . And then they vary the number of women in the group . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupt them more . Men talk over them and dominate the conversation . And that only changes when it 's almost all women . <p> So they were able to control for the effect of being outnumbered . And even other researchers have looked at the U.S. Senate , and they 've seen that powerful men talk more than women , but powerful women do n't talk more than powerful men . So there are a number of research experiments and observations that have confirmed this experience . <p> MARTIN : And Ahmad and Eric are just absolutely not going to interrupt now ' cause they 're both like ... <p> OMAR : I was so close to making a joke . I was going to jump in . <p> MARTIN : I know you were , but you knew better . But you knew better . <p> OMAR : I was just going to let you guys finish . <p> MARTIN : Ahmad , I was going to say - OK , Ahmad , fess up . Have you ever interrupted - have you been accused of this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been interrupting everybody , male and female , about tomorrow 's India versus Pakistan cricket match . There 's , like , supposed to be a billion people watching , and no one in America seems to care . But I keep interrupting anyway . <p> MARTIN : Well , you care . But I will say that I do not want the fact that we are having a light conversation about this to - and I 'm even - and now I 'm kind of wondering whether the fact that we are tempted to joke about it , is that something in itself that we should be thinking about ? Like , what does that mean ? Is it because we as women do n't want men to be uncomfortable , so therefore we 're going to make a joke to , I mean ... <p> DEGGANS : Well , this is Eric , if I could jump in . <p> MARTIN : Go ahead . You may . <p> DEGGANS : And I - one of the things that bothers me the most about this dynamic is men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that - I will fess up that I have been in situations where I 've seen this happen and been so kind of shocked that I just have n't stepped up to defend the woman 's right to speak . <p> And so I think one of the things we as men have to take from these situations is that it 's up to us to step in when we see this happening and stop it . I mean , you know , John McCain , he was n't even - he was there as like an ex-officio member of the committee , I think . He was n't even really there to ask questions . <p> MARTIN : True . <p> DEGGANS : Why is he stepping in and telling her what to do ? <p> MARTIN : OK . <p> DEGGANS : And why did n't other men on that committee step up ? <p> MARTIN : Now , Ahmad , very briefly because I want to - we have one more story to talk about . <p> OMAR : Yeah . I just heard - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of referred me to - I guess there was some articles written about the Obama White House . And a lot of the women decided that they were going to amplify their voices by kind of backing each other up as another way to kind of combat that . <p> CHIRA : That 's exactly right . <p> MARTIN : So before we let you go , there is this other big media story that we are paying attention to because tomorrow NBC 's expected to air an interview conducted by their newest host , Megyn Kelly , formerly of Fox News and Alex Jones . Now , he 's the host of that far-right conspiracy theorizing show Infowars known for alleging that the terrorist attacks on September 11 were an inside job and that the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a fraud . <p> This has been - the interview has n't even aired yet , and already there 's huge controversy about it . Some people say that it should n't be happening at all . And now it turns out that Alex Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , she - that she was n't going to ask him gotcha questions . And so for - so everyone here in this conversation has been an editor at some point , has some kind of responsibility for putting things on the air . So I just want to ask you briefly , should this be happening at all ? Ahmad , do you want to answer that ? <p> OMAR : The interview itself ? <p> MARTIN : Yeah . <p> OMAR : I mean , I think there 's some value to hearing it because , you know , it 's such a - he 's such a big figure now . There are a lot of people who are listening to him , so there 's value in digging in . As far as the pre-interview comments , it 's hard to say , you know , what he might have edited , so it 's tough to judge . Obviously , he 's saying it 's taken out of context . The thing is going to be on tomorrow , so we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OMAR : Please , go ahead . <p> MARTIN : ... But have to . Sue , final thought from you ? <p> CHIRA : Yes . I do believe that , you know , noxious people still need to be interviewed so we understand what they 're about . And as Ahmad said , I wonder about exactly what the full context was of the pre-interview . But it - I understand there 's a great deal of pain experienced by Sandy Hook families and others who find him so toxic . <p> MARTIN : Eric , final thought ? Ten seconds . <p> DEGGANS : Megyn Kelly has learned the hard way that when you interview a demagogue who 's adept at manipulating the media , you have to be very careful . <p> MARTIN : All right . More to come , I 'm sure . That 's Susan Chira of The New York Times , Eric Deggans , NPR 's TV critic , and Ahmad Omar , ALL THINGS CONSIDERED editor . Thank you all so much .

This week , the CEO announced he is taking a sudden leave of absence . A former U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . It 's a terrifying moment for many investors who want that $70 billion unicorn to make them rich or richer " not implode . <p> But there is one Uber investor who stands out for how she decided to speak up . It was not very Silicon Valley-like of her , but Freada Kapor Klein wanted to turn the crisis into a teachable moment . And while this week 's events could lead her to say " I told you so , " she has a different takeaway . <p> Let 's rewind a few months . Kapor Klein decided to write an open letter to Uber " which she published with her husband " after a young woman shared an explosive account of sexual harassment at Uber headquarters . <p> Kapor Klein is a venture capitalist , or a VC . That means she makes money by betting on technology startups . Uber is one of those startups . She has committed to " impact investment " " businesses that can turn a profit while also making the world a better place . For too many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she stayed silent . She tried to influence the company from the inside , though she did n't see a real will among leadership to change . While " Silicon Valley prides itself on pattern recognition , " the letter said , Uber had " toxic patterns " that needed to stop . <p> Kapor Klein thought she was just saying what insiders knew : This is not a one-off . Turns out , her peers did n't like that and wanted her to pay for it . <p> " I could imagine that they would n't love the Uber letter , " Kapor Klein says in an interview with NPR in mid-March . " But then that they would decide the next step they ought to go , is go after our high growth , hot startups and try to get them away from us ! " <p> She 's just learned that other VCs are trying to poach one of her hottest investments , and they 're citing the Uber letter to do it , basically saying : this investor throws her own people under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to go pitch them . It 's another to say , ' Get away from Kapor . See , they 're going to do this to you , ' " she says . <p> It may be counterintuitive , but in Silicon Valley , the land that created tweeting , there is a code of silence among the rich . People are here to make money , not to agitate . She violated that code . <p> But she wo n't back down . She tells me I should call a shortlist of her most powerful peers and demand they respond on the record . " Go to Sequoia , go to Benchmark , go to Kleiner , go to Accel , go to Andreessen , go to Khosla , " she names the kings of much-storied Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park , Calif . <p> She 's sitting inside the Kapor Center for Social Impact " a name that spells out the intent of the place . Kapor Klein and her husband bought this four-story building in central Oakland " what 's become the edge of Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco " and it houses an investment arm , research and philanthropic projects . <p> Kapor Klein is 64 years old , petite with jet black eyes and curly hair to match . She is tense as she recounts the blowback , her folded hands resting on a conference table made of reclaimed wood . Meanwhile her dog is napping by her feet , sprawled on a gray carpet made of recycled fishing nets . ( She designed the building to be green . ) <p> Dudley 's snoring breaks her concentration , and she let 's out a laugh . He 's a rescue dog , but sometimes she claims he 's a therapy dog . " You can see why . Does n't he make you feel better ? " <p> She wakes him up and the two go in search of her husband and business partner , Mitch Kapor . When they find him , he happens to be meeting with the president of Silicon Valley Bank " who is trying to not get in the middle of the couple 's conversation . But Kapor Klein reels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . Greg Becker politely offers his take : " Yeah , people compete ... anyway they can , right ? That 's " unfortunately it 's human nature ... . " <p> Kapor Klein points to her dog , who is now rubbing his enormous cream coat against the banker 's leg , and she teases : " I thought it was just dogs that did that . Dogs , not humans . " Her husband ends the conversation by saying : " It 's a dog-eat-dog world . " <p> This is his way of acting as her buffer " she , the one who pushes ; he , the one who moderates . <p> Mitch Kapor is a bit of a legend , by the way . In the 1980s he founded Lotus , the famous spreadsheet maker . Some compare him to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates . <p> He pulled Kapor Klein into the tech world when he hired her to fix Lotus ' culture in 1984 , to make it the most progressive employer in the U.S. Quite the job description . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how he should be " more sensitive " about his power , how he could make or break an employee 's day just with eye contact . <p> The couple did n't get together until years later , when she sought him out for career advice ; and his second marriage fell apart . He asked her out on a date . He had a son and a daughter . She was 43 and did n't have kids . She assumed it was a summer fling and warned him , date two , that she 's not " stepmom material . " <p> Turns out , it was n't a fling . <p> Her life 's work is to change the culture of Silicon Valley " a place she feels has gone backward in time . There are far fewer women in computer science today than in the 1980s . Blacks and Latinos are missing too . Kapor Klein faults the investor class , which holds on to the myth of meritocracy , that they are the hyper-rational conduits of capital and it so just happens that white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying she 's heard one too many times : " We do n't care if you 're orange or blue ; the only color we care about is green . " <p> If all Kapor Klein did was critique , she 'd be irrelevant here . This place values people who build things . And that is what she is doing . The building feels like an alternate universe " one where tech somehow looks like the rest of America . <p> On one floor , there 's the investment team . Their portfolio includes Genius Plaza " the hot startup that others now want to poach . It 's an online education platform founded by Ana Roca Castro , a woman from the Dominican Republic ( which is exotic in these parts ) . She 's landed major contracts with national agencies throughout Latin America , and is working to get into more U.S. schools . <p> Castro , who is based in Albany , N.Y. , describes Kapor Klein as " protective , " an early investor who tries to shoo away others who do n't share their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech founder disagrees . " When someone is territorial they want nobody around , " but in multiple instances , Kapor Klein has opened doors she did n't know to knock . " She 'll be the first to push me , saying , ' Do n't be afraid . ' " <p> Kapor Klein keeps an eclectic inner circle . It includes a former head of the NAACP ; the woman who filed ( and lost ) a high-profile sexual harassment lawsuit against a leading venture capital fund ; and Ulili Onovakpuri . The 32-year-old advises the health care portfolio , deciding which startups get money . But their relationship started when she was a teenager . Her now long-time mentor gave her a scholarship to UC Berkeley . ( Kapor Klein launched the IDEAL Scholars Fund , for high-achieving minority students , after California ended affirmative action in schools . ) <p> Round the corner , social scientists are running data on why people leave tech , looking for holes in the leaky pipeline , so to speak . ( They later published this study . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMASH math and science program for students of color at Stanford " shares the lesson he wants to drill into young minds . <p> " You 're going to step into places where there 's a line of people and none of them look like you . But you 've earned your space . So get in that line , push them aside , " he says . " You ca n't just look at that line and say I do n't fit in there . Make your fit . " <p> It 's a very Silicon Valley way of being . It 's how Uber CEO Travis Kalanick broke the yellow cab industry in city after city . <p> In some ways , Kapor Klein wants young people who grew up poor to channel Silicon Valley 's sense of entitlement " the idea that it 's OK to fail ; that failure is necessary ; and that one deserves support anyway . She herself does n't come from money . She grew up on a U.S. Air Force base in Biloxi , Miss. , and one of her earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother bloodied , beaten for being a Jew . She knew then the world is n't fair . <p> The Uber row is n't her first in Silicon Valley . To some extent , she 's used to it . She is rich ( she wo n't disclose how rich ) and travels in wealthy circles , where people have strong feelings about money . She remembers a billionaire who suggested she 's spending too much on her do-gooder education programs . She recollects telling him , " Well , you probably write a check that 's somewhere between five and 10 times that amount of money for private kindergarten for your child . " <p> She 's quick to point out , though , that she jabbed because she was asking him to donate . If there was n't a specific ask , a concrete step she was advocating , she said she would hold back . <p> NPR did approach leading investors ( as Kapor Klein suggested ) to get their take on Uber , her letter , and what 's the real problem . One was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a shareholder in a company and a stakeholder in a company , you would want to speak with one voice and you would want to work on the problem primarily , " says Jason Calacanis . " To kind of blindside a company with a post like that means now the company not only has to solve the problem , they have to react to that position publicly . " <p> Calacanis is an influential angel investor , and author of a new book on how to invest . While he respects Kapor Klein 's work with the underprivileged ( he 's invited her to speak about it to his startups ) , he says that the way she spoke out created a " negative atmosphere " " a media circus . <p> And , Calacanis adds , it takes a hard-charging CEO to build the Uber empire . Soft questions around culture , an inclusive culture " those come later . " After you 've won , or won a decent amount of market share or won the early fights , I think you have to shift gears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going through . " <p> Kapor Klein disagrees " and Uber 's monumental meltdown is arguably proof she was right . But when I sit down with her in April , as the drama continues to unfold , she 's become hesitant . Uber reached out to her for help , after her letter . Now , as I ask questions about it , she 's being tight-lipped . <p> Asked if she is uncomfortable , she says she is , " because my goal now is to help Uber and any other company that really genuinely wants to change . I do n't know what snippets you might use , how they might hear that , and whether that 's going to hamper the efforts . " <p> Kapor Klein wants the world to understand : Yes , she spoke out when others would not . But no , Uber is n't the only problem child in Silicon Valley . They just happened to get caught . This week she and her husband issued a statement to that effect , saying " the company deserves some room " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HOST : <p> With Uber in upheaval , investors are hoping the company will pull it together and continue to make them money .

The only color we care about is green . <p> SHAHANI : But if all Kapor Klein did was critique she 'd be irrelevant here . This place values people who build things . And that is what she 's doing .

Downstairs , Gabriel Chaparro , who 's running a science and tech program for students of color at Stanford , shares a lesson he 's drilling into the young minds . <p> GABRIEL CHAPARRO : You 're going to step into places where there 's a line of people and none of them look like you . But you have to take your space . You ca n't just look at that line and say , I do n't fit in there .

I did approach leading investors , as Kapor Klein suggested , to get their take on Uber , her letter and what 's the real problem . One was willing to go on the record . <p> JASON CALACANIS : To kind of blindside a company with a post like that means now the company not only has to solve the problem , they have to react to that position publicly . <p> CALACANIS : After you 've won or , you know , won a decent amount of market share or won the early fights , I think you have to shift gears a bit . And I think that 's what Uber 's going through . <p> SHAHANI : Kapor Klein disagrees , and Uber 's monumental breakdown is arguably proof she was right . But when I sit down with her in April as the drama continues to unfold , I notice she 's hesitant . Uber reached out to her for help after the letter . Now she 's being tightlipped . I ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my goal now is to help Uber and any other company that really , genuinely wants to change . <p> SHAHANI : Kapor Klein wants the world to understand , yes , she spoke out when others would not , but , no , Uber is n't the only problem child in Silicon Valley . They just happened to get caught . This week she and her husband issued a statement to that effect , saying the company deserves some room to work on itself . Aarti Shahani , NPR News , Oakland .

At that point if you want to listen to those additional channels you would have to buy an HD radio . Even then , though , you will still be able to receive our regular NHPR FM signal just like you do now . <p> I keep hearing drop-outs or other interruptions in your programming . What 's the cause ? <p> NHPR works hard to maintain its network of transmitters , translators and satellite downlinks . Occasionally , problems pop up and we do our best to address them as quickly as possible . <p> Common problems include transmitter outages , when no signal is received and you only receive static when you tune to NHPR . Another common problem is loss of programming , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent problem is interference . With the onslaught of wireless communication devices , such as cellular phones , pagers , wi-fi networks and two-way radios , we have experienced an increase in interference-related problems . This manifests itself by brief chirps , whistles or drop-outs . The problem can last from a few seconds to several minutes . <p> When I tune in to NHPR , I can hear another radio station instead . What 's causing this ? <p> This is usually caused by a temperature inversion in the atmosphere . It occurs when there is an odd collision of weather and atmospheric conditions , causing radio waves to act strangely . It is temporary , lasting from a few minutes to an hour . The problem should correct itself soon , so please stay tuned . <p> I can receive another public radio station , but not NHPR . Why ? <p> Because radio waves do not stop at state lines , you might be able to hear another public radio station more clearly than you will NHPR . If you are located closer to another station 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive their signal better . <p> I can hear NHPR in my car , but not on the clock radio next to my bed . Why ? <p> Generally speaking , radios in your automobile are better receivers of radio signals than those in your house . Typically , clock radios use the power cord as an antenna . They might also have a flexible , whip antenna built into the radio . The location of the power cord , or whip antenna , will affect your reception . If you 've recently moved your radio , this can affect reception . Try repositioning the radio and/or power cord . <p> Why is the signal so weak in my city or town ? <p> While NHPR would love to add a full-powered station everywhere its signal is weak , the decision of where and when we add a station is not entirely within our control . The FCC strictly regulates where a radio station can be built , how powerfully it can broadcast , and where it will be located on the dial . Additionally , the span of radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the radio dial . <p> Because we are located in a very crowded corner of the country , it is difficult to find available non-commercial frequencies , and commercial frequencies are very expensive to acquire . NHPR has searched continuously for available frequencies throughout New Hampshire , as well as in Vermont , Maine and Massachusetts . However , we 've always run the risk of interfering with other non-commercial broadcasters already broadcasting . The FCC wo n't allow us to cause interference with another station . Additionally , international treaties prevent us from interfering with Canadian stations . <p> How can I listen to NHPR ? <p> There are full-power radio stations and lower-power translator stations across New Hampshire that deliver NHPR 's programming to your radio .

Both of them are period pieces , one set in the 1970s , the other in the 1980s . And both are created by and starring women . But past that , the two new shows have little in common except that David likes them both . <p> DAVID BIANCULLI , BYLINE : One new show premiering this week on Sunday on the PBS Masterpiece series actually is a miniseries and a prequel . It 's also the starting point for a possible series of mystery stories featuring the same character . Beginning in 1991 , Helen Mirren starred as police detective Jane Tennison in a series of British mysteries called " Prime Suspect " based on novels written by Lynda La Plante and imported by PBS . Mirren was wonderful . These were the performances more than anything else that made her Helen Mirren . And so were the mysteries , which were about much more than the crime she solved and the suspects she so skillfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about the chauvinistic treatment her Jane Tennison had to overcome in the station house and on the case and about her own personal demons as well . " Prime Suspect : Tennison , " this new series , also is based on a novel by Lynda La Plante , so it knows what it 's doing and where it 's going . <p> This TV show throws us back to the character 's first days on the force . In England , It was titled " Prime Suspect 1973 . " Jane was 22 then and is played by Stefanie Martini , a young actress given the almost impossible task of trying to act as magnetically as Helen Mirren . Imagine a young actor given the job of approximating Peter Falk in young " Columbo . " But she does a good job here being buffeted around by colleagues while enduring slights and fighting for slow but steady chances for advancement . She 's always observing , questioning and learning . And sometimes , as when being driven by a superior officer to the home of a young murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally . Sam Reid plays her boss , Detective Inspector Bradfield . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW , " PRIME SUSPECT : TENNISON " ) <p> STEFANIE MARTINI : ( As Jane Tennison ) Can I ask , sir - when we get there , I know what your role is but once we 're inside , if the mother cries , do I comfort her ? How would I do that ? Sorry if I 'm asking too many questions . <p> BIANCULLI : In this first of what is bound to be a series of Tennison sequels , one murder leads to another , then to a bank robbery as well as to plot details that explain , for example , why Tennison has issues trusting men and when and how she developed her taste for alcohol . The leading performance by Martini is effective , but it 's the back story of the character that makes this prequel most compelling of all . <p> And then there 's " GLOW , " the 10-episode first season of which premieres Friday on Netflix . It stars Alison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife Trudy on AMCs " Mad Men " and sweet Annie on NBC 's " Community .

" Mensch also wrote and produced for Jenji Kohan 's Netflix series " Orange Is The New Black . " And Kohan is an executive producer here as well . And while " GLOW " starts as an all-out comedy , it sneaks up on you . Before the 10 episodes are over , you 'll be taking the characters and their relationships and problems very seriously . <p> And there are other acting standouts , including Betty Gilpin from both " Nurse Jackie " and " Masters Of Sex " as a former soap opera star desperate enough to try to become a wrestling star instead . In " GLOW , " as in " Prime Suspect : Tennison , " women have it tough and have to make some tough choices to fight and survive and advance , whether they 're wrestling with their demons or just wrestling .

Best known for his work on the HBO comedy series " Silicon Valley , " the Pakistani-American comedian Kumail Nanjiani steps into his first leading role in a feature film in " The Big Sick . " It 's a semi-autobiographical love story that he co-wrote with his wife , Emily V. Gordon . The film was directed by Michael Showalter and premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival , where critic Justin Chang first saw it . <p> JUSTIN CHANG , BYLINE : " The Big Sick " sounds on paper like a fairly conventional romantic dramedy . It begins with a meet cute , proceeds confidently through flirtation , sex and full-fledged romance , then skids to a halt with a nasty breakup followed by a dire medical emergency that seems fated to end in reconciliation or grief . Judd Apatow is one of the producers , and you can sense his influence in the movie 's emotional density as well as its precision-tooled stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . The lovers in the story are a Pakistani-American man and a white woman , and that complication is enough to make a conventional narrative seem positively radical . It 's a case of art imitating life . <p> " The Big Sick " was written by the actor Kumail Nanjiani and his wife , the writer-producer Emily V. Gordon . Together they have spun a key chapter of their lives into a wonderfully funny and affecting romance as well as a thorny consideration of interracial dating and the challenges of being a Muslim immigrant in present-day America . While Emily is played with winning spirit by Zoe Kazan , Nanjiani , who is best known for his performance on HBO 's " Silicon Valley , " does a terrific job of playing a younger version of himself , a trickier feat than it sounds . <p> In the movie , Kumail , who was born in Pakistan and moved to Chicago with his family as a teenager , makes a living as an Uber driver but aspires to a career in stand-up comedy . He 's increasingly torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of obligation to his traditionalist parents , played by Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff . They 'd like him to ditch the comedy , become a lawyer and marry one of the many nice Pakistani-American girls they keep inviting over to dinner . <p> What his parents do n't know is that Kumail has already become smitten with Emily after meeting her at one of his comedy shows . She let 's out a friendly woo-hoo during his set . He ribs her for heckling him . Before long , they 're inseparable . And while Emily may not be a professional comedian , to the movie 's good fortune , she does n't let Kumail monopolize the jokes . It 's clear enough from their first date , amid some delightful postcoital banter , that she 's on the same goofy anything-for-a-punchline wavelength that he is . <p> KAZAN : ( As Emily ) Yeah , I 'm just not that kind of girl . I only have sex once on the first date . <p> NANJIANI : ( As Kumail ) What is happening ? What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm changing under this blanket . <p> NANJIANI : ( As Kumail ) I 've seen everything . Do you remember we were just having sex ? <p> KAZAN : ( As Emily ) Yeah , but you were , like , in the throes of passion then . Listen . I had a really nice time . Thank you very much .

She begins to realize just how beholden he is to his family 's culture with its strict Muslim beliefs and arranged marriages and angrily breaks things off . A different movie might have engineered an awkward but ultimately cathartic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had precisely the opposite outcome in store . <p> When Emily suddenly develops a serious infection and is placed in a medically induced coma , Kumail finds himself spending several days in the hospital waiting room with her out-of-town parents , Beth and Terry . They 're played by Holly Hunter and Ray Romano , and their marvelously full-bodied performances are the movie 's secret weapon . Romano is wonderful here as a goofy sad sack with a lot of lame jokes and a variation on the slow drawl he perfected on " Everybody Loves Raymond . " And there are almost no words to do Hunter justice . Beth is hard on Kumail at first for messing things up with her daughter . But in time , her spitfire veneer cracks open , revealing a heart of enormous tenderness and grace . When Hunter smiles , you could almost warm your hands over the screen . <p> Smoothly directed by Michael Showalter , " The Big Sick " is both a crowd-pleaser and an eye-opener , and it 's quietly groundbreaking in the way it puts Kumail 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his profound sense of being caught between two worlds . Still , at times , you have to wonder if these comic insights , sharp as they are , have been specifically tailored to flatter a Western audience . <p> Kher and Shroff are excellent as Kumail 's parents , but I wanted more from their characters than comic uptightness and dramatic outrage . Ironically , their troubles communicating with their son are precisely the reason they do n't register as fully dimensional figures the way Beth and Terry do - all of which is to say that " The Big Sick " is both a wonderful movie and an imperfect milestone . With any luck , we 'll look back on it someday , and it wo n't feel like a milestone at all . <p> GROSS : Justin Chang is a film critic for the Los Angeles Times .

We 'll look at this , and at why there 's cause for optimism , particularly when it comes to prevention and a promising treatment , immunotherapy . <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> 57:43 <p> Listen to the conversation . <p> This show originally aired on June 1 , 2017. - <p> GUESTS : <p> Peter Ames -- Senior Director of State Health Systems at the New England Division of the American Cancer Society . <p> Nancy Calder -- Diagnosed with melanoma about eight years ago , she was given a six percent chance of survival . She underwent- immunotherapy treatment , which was used to shrink her tumors , and she is now considered cancer free. - <p> Dr. Steve Del Guidice -- Dermatologist who has practiced in Concord for thirty years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. - <p> Peter Aimes , with the New England Division of the American Cancer Society , says : <p> The highest risks are white males over fifty . And so that population is increasing in New Hampshire . But another large part of the story is actually young white women , and there was a significant increase in the late nineties early two-thousands , in young white women 's melanoma rate in New Hampshire . We were actually the second highest rate in melanoma in the country . <p> How worried should we be on cloudy days ? <p> Dr. Steve Del Guidice , a dermatologist , says that ultraviolet rays , which are harmful to skin , still penetrate through clouds . <p> You ca n't see ultraviolet rays .

So in other words , they were low level SPF factors that helped prevent a burn , and incur a tan ... and people did n't really understand the dangers until the late seventies , early eighties . <p> Sun damage during childhood and young adulthood , the physicians say , leads to skin cancer later in life , which explains why the older population has seen an increase in skin cancer from damage that occurred decades before. - <p> Why is melanoma , one form of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that melanoma is more likely than other skin cancers , like basal cell carcinoma ( the most common skin cancer ) , to be metastatic : - <p> So it spreads . It spreads to other organs in later stages . It grows initially in the skin and then can become deeper in the skin , and then can spread to the lymph nodes and other organs . And that 's the most deadly part of the disease , whereas these other cancers do n't metastasize or spread as frequently as melanoma does. - <p> What should we look for when buying a sunscreen ? <p> Dr. Del Guidice- has three guidelines for purchasing sunscreen : <p> Get one that is an SPF sun protection 30 or higher . Get one that says ' broad spectrum , ' which blocks UVA and UVB ... and get one that 's water resistant. - <p> Dr. Del Guidice says that the type of sunscreen , such as a spray , gel , or lotion , is preferential . For example : <p> It might just be easier to spray a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sprays on the face . <p> What about those with allergies or sensitive skin ? <p> Dr. Del Guidice recommends Vanicream , which is manufactured for people with skin sensitivity . It is free of most chemicals and fragrances that may cause irritation . <p> People who have survived melanoma were more likely to protect themselves from sun exposure than those who had n't experienced the disease , but a significant portion of them still reported getting a sunburn in the past year , among other behaviors that might increase the risk of a new cancer . 
@@37206203 @6206203/ <p> The Civic Museum of Natural History in Milan , which I visited last month , contains a magnificent collection of dioramas . <p> The museum was badly damaged during WWII , so the oldest of them dates back no earlier than the 1950s . But the diorama form is very much alive and well in this museum as , indeed , it is in some other natural history museums around the world . There are more than 100 dioramas in the Milan collection " and three new ones are coming soon . <p> This is somehow surprising . Diorama seems so old-fashioned . It dates back to the era before widespread access to color photography , not to mention to a time when free digital access to information and graphical media would have been considered science-fiction . Indeed , everything you see in a diorama is a collaboration of science and craft or science and art . Every leaf , for example , in the diorama jungle will be hand-cut and hand-painted . And even the animals , which are usually genuine , have been subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the animals in a diorama are stiff " and not only because they are stuffed . They are stiff also because there is something theatrical about the way they are staged or posed . <p> And this , in turn , I think , has everything to do with the fact that there is a pane of glass separating us and them . <p> Ask yourself : Why the glass ? <p> This is no zoo and there 's no danger of anything breaking out . Nor is there any reason to think that people are going to invade diorama exhibits . <p> No , the glass has a different sort of function . It provides a frame . It works like the curtains bunched in a cord at either end of a theatrical stage . It is the pane separating us from the world of the diorama . Without the glass , you 're just looking at a display in front of you . With the glass , you are are peering , as if by magic , into a world remote in space and time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look at a diorama , we only pretend to see what it shows us . <p> In Milan , there is one diorama where a tree casts shadows on the sky . Very few of the people in my tour group noticed this . ( I did n't . ) I think this is not because we did n't see the sky , or because the painted backdrop created a perfect sky illusion . It 's that we were only pretending it was the sky anyway . <p> I go into this because it may be that the quaintness and old-wordiness of dioramas have something to do with the way they invite pretend " and , so , play " to happen . And this may also explain the remarkable fact that , despite the quaintness , diorama thrives as an exhibition mode in today 's high-tech culture . <p> My tour guide in Milan bemoaned the fact that the public tends to think of natural history museums , in general , as places for kids . This is not accurate , he insisted . Natural history museums are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's true . But they are also places , as we have just been considering , for magic , pretend and play . Maybe grown ups do n't do that so well . In fact , maybe we ca n't do it the way we used to do it as children . <p> You can organize all the evening cocktail parties you like at the museum , but that wo n't get the grown-ups to use the pane-glass portal the way kids can . <p> Alva No+ is a philosopher at the University of California , Berkeley , where he writes and teaches about perception , consciousness and art .

The court will have to decide that in coming months . <p> On Monday , White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the new state-backed lawsuit . He replied that Trump 's business interests " do not violate the Emoluments Clause , " for reasons spelled out by the Justice Department 's filing on Friday . <p> This new suit was brought by attorneys general who are both Democrats , Spicer noted .

" <p> The attorneys general accused the president of violating the Constitution 's clause that blocks federal officials from accepting gifts , or emoluments , from foreign governments . The Constitution also bars a president from accepting economic benefits from federal or state governments , other than a basic salary . <p> Since Trump continues to own and profit from the Trump Organization , the lawsuit claims citizens can not know whether their president is making decisions in the best interests of the nation or rather out of " self-interested motivations grounded in the international and domestic business dealings in which President Trump 's personal fortune is at stake .

The director Miguel Arteta and the screenwriter Mike White have collaborated several times in the past on the movies " Chuck &amp; Buck " and " The Good Girl " as well as the HBO series " Enlightened .

She 's a soulful-nurturing type with a winsome Earth Mother demeanor that inevitably leads some to dismiss her as meek and unsophisticated . <p> But the writer , Mike White , and the director , Miguel Arteta , deftly turn that assumption on its head .

They 're nonplussed but polite . The star of the evening is Doug Strutt , a billionaire real-estate mogul played by a marvelous John Lithgow , arriving with his wife played by Amy Landecker . Doug is an arrogant blowhard and an unapologetically monstrous human being with a chain of luxury hotels that have wreaked social and environmental havoc in developing countries worldwide . <p> Laughing it up with the boys on the patio , Doug takes one look at Beatriz and , mistaking her for the help , asks her to refresh his drink . From there , the evening gets steadily worse . But the movie just keeps getting better as Arteta and White raise the emotional temperature by delicious incremental degrees .

But to its credit , this queasily funny and suspenseful movie is more than just a self-satisfied exercise in ideological deck stacking . <p> There 's a mischievous vibe here that recalls the great bourgeois skewering of Louis Sponwell ( ph ) particularly the way the story keeps building and releasing tension until a violent end seems inevitable .

She 's leaning in , trying to figure out what brought her to this dinner table and why her destiny and Doug 's have become so improbably entwined . <p> Why are we here ? What difference can we make ? These are questions that Beatriz takes incredibly seriously . And they will resonate with anyone who has ever considered the perpetually troubled state of humanity and felt a deep inconsolable despair .

That it would be okay , and that I was n't someone who would ever really fall in love . So I could just have a friendship . And I realized very soon after that it was just not good for him and not good for me . So I was really only married functionally for about six months , and I left after nine , and got divorced after a couple of years . So it was traumatic because I 'd made a commitment , but it was also very , very expansive once I started to break loose of trying to fit in and just try to go off and discover who I was and how I was going to craft my path in the world .

According to the U.N . Refugee agency , at least 20 people with albinism have been killed in Malawi since 2014 for their body parts .

The songs are meant to be pure vehicles for the writers ' self-expression " producer Brennan 's ultimate goal for the project . <p> White African Power is the newest in a string of projects produced by Brennan that seek to give voice to people who are normally voiceless . " The whole intention , " says Brennan , " is to hear from individuals , the invisible , and learn from them . So our only directive was ' What do you want the world to know ?

@@37206258 @6206258/ <p> Noses are the unsung feature of the face , sunscreened or surgically fixed , but rarely exalted . And the sense they enable , smelling , is likewise uncelebrated . Regularly voted the " sense I 'd be most willing to lose " , olfaction is largely ignored " unless it brings word of something savory or foul nearby . <p> But we are born smellers . After being enveloped while in the womb in the smell of our mother and the foods she ingested , babies emerge macrosmatic , keen-smelling . They find the mother 's nipple and recognize their parents by scent . Children can identify their siblings and friends by smell . In those earliest sniffings , smelling is all about discovery and navigation . <p> Gradually , though , we forsake our noses . What have you smelled today ? Perhaps a half-dozen odors , mostly likely food or manufactured fragrance , or maybe one . Or none . Over the same period , your dog has sniffed his way out of sleep , come to examine your smell in the morning , busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk outside , and may have found his way to his fellow canines by scent . <p> We admire the dog 's olfactory acuity , and we should : dogs have hundreds of millions more olfactory receptors , the cells at the back of the nose that grab odors out of the air , than we do . They have two dedicated , separate routes in their snouts for sniffing and breathing ; they have elaborate bones in their nose that hold yet more olfactory tissue ; they even exhale out the side slits of their nostrils in order not to disturb the odors coming in . And as the performance of dogs that do tracking , search-and-rescue , and other detection tasks , they can use their highly sensitive olfactory instruments to locate substances that we never even thought had an odor : cancerous cells ; minute quantities of TNT ; the day-old footprint left by a missing person . <p> All is not lost for us humans , though . We have the equipment , and , while not as varied or extensive as the dogs ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Associate Professor at Rutgers , published a review in Science last month reminding us that humans do , after all , have an olfactory bulb , and Swedish professor Matthias Laska has extensively demonstrated that in detecting some odors , such as amyl acetate ( which smells like banana ) , we are plenty sensitive . Our experience of the flavor of food is mostly due to smell , experienced through the back of the mouth " retronasal olfaction " instead of through the nostrils . <p> Knowing all this , I recently embarked on a project culminating in my book Being a Dog : Following the Dog into a World of Smell , in which I tried to improve my sense of smell by following the dog 's lead , as well as that of some olfactory experts , among them a perfumer , a sommelier , and a pair of animal trackers . Dogs excepted , few of these experts were born noses . I learned that a few simple steps can change your nose from neglected to noticed , as it had for them : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contrast it with the frequency with which you see a person with nose smashed against a surface , inhaling calmly and confidently . Simply getting closer to a source and bravely sniffing will bring more odor molecules into our noses . <p> Get over it . In the U.S. , at least , our culture is a discourager of smells . The baby who notices an interesting smell ? Her parents ignore her . Eventually , she will think of smells in a mostly binary way , as lovely or horrible . By contrast , experts in smelling view odors merely as information , not intrinsically good or bad , just as the images that we see tell us about our world . Treat scents like sights and it becomes easier to smell . <p> Name the source . Once you start bringing your attention to what you smell , you may be at a loss for words : English does n't have much of a vocabulary for smells . So olfactory experts create their own jargon . You can adopt theirs , but consider , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco that floods me with memories of my father 's desk ; a whiff of pencil shavings , zipping me back to learning cursive in my third grade classroom . Find your own language , images or memories to represent the smell , and in so doing it will be easier to invoke the next time you sniff it . <p> Even after spending months learning how to smell like a dog , observing detection dog training , following truffle dogs , and accompanying my own dog train in the sport of " nose work " , I feel certain : I do n't experience the world my dog does . But my own world is changed : It smells . And by smelling intentionally instead of just letting smells happen to me , odors have lost their simplicity . <p> I 'm glad to smell my family and friends . I know the smell of the afternoon in my office , warmed by sun , as well as the smell of the advent of spring . Before opening my eyes on awakening this morning , I could smell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my husband was up .

It is also " reactive " with ammonia and acids , forming more harmful fumes . <p> " One of the most common home accidents is the mixing of products containing chlorine bleach with those containing ammonia , " says WTC . The combination creates chloramine gas , which is highly irritating to the lungs . Since many cleaning products contain ammonia , the inadvertent mixing must be avoided .

A dilution of bleach in water is effective as a disinfectant , and can be scrubbed onto non-porous food-contact surfaces like plastic cutting boards or refrigerator shelves and left to air dry . The Clorox Company recommends a solution of one tablespoon bleach per gallon of water for sanitizing . <p> So , what are the better ways to keep drains clear ? Home drains in the kitchen and bath generally get clogged by grease , food waste and hair , none of which will be effectively dispersed by bleach .

So here are some of the best " and our best answers . <p> The questions have been edited for length and clarity . <p> What 's the difference between hunger and famine ? And why should we care about famines ? -- Anjala Illemassene <p> " Hunger is a physiological sensation , " explains Tufts professor Daniel Maxwell , acting director of the university 's Feinstein International Center , based at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy . It 's brought on by what is formally called " food insecurity , " which is just another way of saying a lack of nutritious food on a regular basis . <p> " Famine is an extreme event leading to widespread death , " he says , and it 's typically about politics and violence , as much as it is about the overall availability of food . <p> Hunger exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high levels of poverty . For a situation to be officially declared a famine by the United Nations , hunger needs to be concentrated and catastrophic . As we explained in February , there 's a five-stage scale used to rate food insecurity emergencies . To hit No. 5 , which is " famine , " here are the criteria : <p> " At least 1 in 5 households now faces an extreme lack of food , more than 30 percent of the population is suffering from acute malnutrition , and at least two people out of every 10,000 are dying each day . " <p> In the 20th century , Maxwell notes , famines killed nearly 75 million people " although outright starvation was often not the direct cause . Instead , people in famines die from cholera , measles or other nasty diseases because severe malnutrition leads to compromised immune systems , he says . <p> Even people who manage to survive a famine are gravely affected , adds Stephen Were Omamo , deputy director of the World Food Programme . Severe malnutrition " which according to UNICEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 worldwide " has health implications for life , particularly among kids affected during their first 1,000 days . <p> When does food aid work well , and when does n't it work ? -- Anna <p> It works best when people actually get it , and that 's not always so easy to pull off , says Tufts ' Maxwell , who 's co-author of the book , Food Aid After Fifty Years : Recasting Its Role . <p> Beans , lentils and other staples are great , he says , unless they 're sitting in a warehouse , waiting to get boxed , shipped , trucked and who knows what else . The clunky transportation process can take months to coordinate . <p> Now , though , food is often purchased and stored closer to where it 's needed , Maxwell says . But this approach can still be problematic , he says , if its distribution interferes with local markets . <p> That 's why the new form of food aid that 's really taken off is money . Cash can be transmitted digitally rather than airdropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly with a tailored response , " WFP 's Omamo says . Plus , buying power gives people the chance to pick and choose what they need , while generating economic activity . <p> Omamo says cash-based transfers " a term that includes all cash transfers and vouchers , both physical and digital " accounted for less than 1 percent of the food assistance WFP delivered in 2009 . Now it 's close to 20 percent ( with a value of about $1 billion a year ) . <p> Can you address population growth in relation to hunger and famine ? --- Nadia G. <p> To do that , we need to discuss Thomas Robert Malthus , an English economist and scholar born in 1766 . One idea Malthus laid out in his most influential paper , " An Essay on the Principle of Population , " was that the world population continues to grow exponentially , and the food supply ca n't possibly keep up . If that 's true , any day now , we should have too little food for too many people . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although the theory has continued to circulate , it 's been disproved , Omamo of WFP says . Agricultural innovation has helped produce much more food than Malthus ever expected , and population growth is actually showing signs of slowing . <p> Consider the current state of the world : There are plenty of calories to sustain all 7.5 billion of us , but they'r not distributed evenly . Hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry each night . That 's not to say Omamo is n't worried about the future , and particularly the effects of climate change . If we do n't change how we use energy , Omamo says , hunger will become an even bigger challenge . <p> There are some regions that can not support the population that lives there . What 's the point in providing food aid to an unsustainable population ? " Anonymous <p> We 're going to assume you meant drylands , or places without much water . There 's a major problem with writing them off , says Bilal Butt , an assistant professor at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arbor . " They 're almost half of the world 's surface area , " he says . They 're home to hundreds of millions of people , and have supported livestock and people for thousands of years . <p> What 's more , Butt adds , drylands have generally been quite sustainable , especially for nomadic herders . That they move from place to place " has been looked at as outdated and irrational , " Butt says . " But it could not be further from the truth . " They must stay mobile to find forage and water because resources are distributed unevenly in drylands . Because of this strategy , they 're not continually degrading one patch of land by grazing on it . <p> Over the years , nomadic groups have developed various strategies for survival in tough conditions , Butt says . One example he offers is from Kenya , where groups often keep a diverse group of livestock , each with separate feeding strategies . Cows eat differently than sheep , goats and camels , Butt says , so to have a mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some of your animals will find enough grub to survive . ( Here is a fascinating story fromBeef Magazine extolling the virtues of multispecies grazing . ) <p> This technique relies on widespread mobility , and being able to seek out new places to live . So as more land has been developed and taken away from grazing , and conservation areas have banned livestock , that 's limited options . That 's why , Butt says , it 's common to see livestock nibbling on grass in downtown Nairobi . The animals have been there much longer than the cars and buildings . The name of that city comes from the Maasai " cold water , " he explains , because it 's historically been a place that the Maasai would water their livestock . <p> The big problems arrive when a drought strikes , Butt says , and that 's when you 're likely to see images of crowded displaced persons or refugee camps , where people flee not only to escape conflict but also to find food and water during a drought . What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , is that they 've often traveled from hundreds of miles away . " It 's all too easy to dehumanize people in this process , " he adds . " But they 're not careless , and unsustainably using the land . " <p> Instead , they 're dealing with droughts that in recent years have increased in frequency and intensity .

@@37206308 @6206308/ <p> This is not a book on the philosophy of sport as much as it is a collection of meditations by a philosopher who happens to be a sports nut . <p> Papineau explores questions like : What is choking ? How does it differ from other ways in which the performance of the most accomplished athletes can break down ( such as the yips ) ? How do players make decisions , and how do teams " groups of individuals that are more than the sum of their parts " force us to rethink decision theory and game theory ? He even ventures into terrain that has almost nothing to do with sport , such as the status of race as a category and whether the fact that race does n't correspond to anything biologically real gives us a reason to stop using racial categories . <p> The book is not a treatise ; it is more like a recording of conversations the author might be imagined to have had with his buddies after a good game of tennis on a Saturday morning . Philosophy is surely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's . In my view , it is more like an art . But it must be admitted that many philosophers practice it as if it were something sport-like : an activity aiming at the cultivation and exercise not of physical but , rather , of distinctively intellectual skills , as it were , for their own sake . But this is not true of Papineau . His book is motivated by love of sport and by real curiosity about it . <p> But there is an argument that unfolds here , nonetheless , something like a defense of Shankly 's quote . According to Papineau , sports are n't really good for anything : They are n't useful . They are n't a diversion from life that can be praised or , as Papineau considers , criticized , for just this fact . Sports belong to life and are about as intrinsically meaningful , or meaningless , as just about anything else we do , which is to say either not at all , in an ultimate sense , or a whole heck of a lot . Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our skillfulness and because it is joyous and daunting and thrilling and hard to cultivate and exercise our physical capacities . <p> I 'm not quite convinced by this . Not because I 'm not persuaded the sporting life is valuable , nor because I think the value of sports consists in some further good ( health ? perfection ? enlightenment ? ) that it might be thought to enable . My doubts have to do with whether the value of sports can come down to the individual player 's particular experience of sporting activity . Sports are social , and a big part of playing a sport is not only the act of playing with others , but also talking with others about the sport . <p> This is especially true when it comes to the whole business of being a fan or a spectator . Sports fans " and , like Papineau , I am not only a philosopher but also a sports fan " can be know-it-alls . They study the games ; they acquire expertise , and they argue endlessly about teams and plays and tournaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest , and so on . <p> Is n't that true of players as well ? To love sports is n't just to love running all those miles alone on a weekend morning , or even the thrill of trying , finally , to manage a new trick in real play with friends . The sporting life is also a life of reflection on sports " and these reflections are social , collective and communicative . <p> These things are evident in Papineau 's book . He 's player and a fan and a know-it-all and he flaunts his knowledge the way any hyper-enthusiast would . This is not a personal criticism . He 's charming . The book is engaging . And his knowledge of sports is genuine and impressive . <p> But it is meant to be a friendly critique , or the start of one , of his argument . The fact is , sports are n't just activities bent on cultivation of physical skills for their own sake , they are little social worlds in which doing is one thing and reflection on what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And this , in turn , opens up the possibility that sports are not just physical . <p> Papineau knows this . In fact , one of the best bits of his book is his exploration of the ways in which successful sporting performance is a mental " as well as a physical " achievement . Or rather , he rejects the idea that physical accomplishment can be divorced from the possession and exercise of powers of concentration and appreciation . A baseball player , a tennis player , a cricket player , need to use their minds to govern the more distinctively physical aspects of their performances . Papineau rejects , and I agree with him , what he calls the yoga conception " according to which success at sports requires the achievement of a kind of Zen state of mindless flow and automaticity . No , being good at a sport may mean that you do n't need , indeed , that you should n't , focus on the low-level mechanics of what you 're doing . But it does n't mean that you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use your head in the right kind of way . <p> I do n't mean to suggest that sports are not physical . When it comes to sports , it is the physical performance that matters . <p> But there is another way in which the mind gets into the act . Sports is social and is always embedded in a setting of talk and reflection . To be a player who did n't participate in any of that would be like being a speaker who had no second-order views on language and how to talk . That 's an unrealistic conception of what it is to be engaged with sports . <p> Alva No+ is a philosopher at the University of California , Berkeley , where he writes and teaches about perception , consciousness and art .

" <p> The question was posed by Washington Democrat Denny Heck , and it provoked a high-minded response . <p> Here 's what Brennan said in full : <p> " Well , for the last 241 years , the nation and the citizens have cherished the freedom and liberty upon which this country was founded upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freedom and liberty and lost their lives to protect the freedom and liberties of other peoples around the world .

Others , including Trump 's former campaign manager for a time , Paul Manafort ; Carter Page , a former foreign policy adviser ; and , the Washington Postreported , a senior adviser currently in the Trump White House , also are being investigated for their ties . <p> James Comey was fired as FBI director after testifying twice in the past few months on the FBI 's investigation .

Mike Rogers , the director of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command , the very same question at a hearing back in March . <p> Rogers ' answer : <p> " I do n't think it 's in the best interest of our nation for any external entity to attempt to manipulate outcomes , to shape choices . That should be the inherent role of a democracy . The investigation we 're going through , I think , is a positive in the sense it 'll help illuminate to all of us , regardless of party , what are the implications here and what does it mean for us , because I think our conclusion , and that of the intelligence community broadly here , is this " absent some change , this behavior is not likely to stop .

His elderly wife , who suffered from advanced dementia , had just had a breathing tube stuck down her throat . He knew she never would have wanted that . Now he had to decide whether to reverse the life-sustaining treatment that medics had begun . <p> When Dr. Kei Ouchi faced this family as a young resident at Long Island Jewish Medical Center , he had no idea what to say . The husband , who had cared for his wife for the past 10 years , knew her condition had declined so much that she would n't want to be rescued . But when Ouchi offered to take out the tube , the man cried more : " She 's breathing . How can we stop that ? " <p> Ouchi had pursued emergency medicine to rescue victims of gunshot wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for what he encountered : a stream of older patients with serious illnesses like dementia , cancer and heart disease " patients for whom the life-saving techniques he was trained to perform often only prolonged the suffering . <p> As baby boomers age , more of them are visiting the emergency room , which can be an overcrowded , disorienting and even traumatic place . Adults 65 and older made 20.8 million emergency room visits in 2013 , up from 16.2 million in 2000 , according to the most recent hospital survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The survey found 1 in 6 visits to the ER were made by an older patient , a proportion that 's expected to rise . <p> Half of adults in this age group visit the ER in their last month of life , according to a study in the journal Health Affairs . Of those , half die in the hospital , even though most people say they 'd prefer to die at home . <p> Some states on board <p> The influx is prompting more clinicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the default is to do everything possible to extend life . Hospitals across the country " including in Ohio , Texas , Virginia and New Jersey " are bringing palliative care , which focuses on improving quality of life for patients with advanced illness , into the emergency department . <p> Interest is growing among doctors : 149 emergency physicians have become certified in palliative care since that option became available just over a decade ago , and others are working closely with palliative care teams . But efforts to transform the ER face significant challenges , including a lack of time , staffing and expertise , not to mention a culture clash . <p> Researchers who interviewed emergency room staff at two Boston hospitals , for instance , found resistance to palliative care . ER doctors questioned how they could handle delicate end-of-life conversations for patients they barely knew . Others argued that the ER , with its " cold , simple rooms " and drunken patients screaming , is not an appropriate place to provide palliative care , which tends to physical , psychological and spiritual needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , when he visited the homes of older patients who frequently visited the emergency room . He saw how obstacles like transportation , frailty and poor vision made it difficult for them to leave the house to see a doctor . <p> " So what do they do ? " Ouchi asks . " They call 911 . " <p> When these patients arrive at the emergency room , doctors treat their acute symptoms , but not their underlying needs , Ouchi says . In more severe cases , when the patient ca n't talk and does n't have an advanced directive or a medical decision-maker available , doctors pursue the most aggressive care possible to keep them alive : CPR , intravenous fluids , breathing tubes . <p> " Our default in the ER is pedal to the metal , " says Dr. Corita Grudzen , an emergency physician at NYU Langone Medical Center who studies palliative care in the ER . But when doctors learn after the fact that the patient would not have wanted that , the emergency rescue forces families to choose whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very i 'll " if they need an IV drip to maintain blood pressure , a ventilator to breathe , or medication to restart the heart " they are most likely to end up in an intensive care unit , where the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections and delirium is increased , Grudzen says . Meanwhile , it 's not clear whether these aggressive interventions really extend their lives , she adds . <p> Some have sought to address these problems by creating separate , quieter emergency rooms for older patients . Others say bringing palliative care consultations into regular emergency rooms could reduce hospitalization , drive down costs and even extend life . <p> There 's no hard evidence that this approach will live up to its promise . The only major randomized controlled trial , which Grudzen led at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City , found that palliative care consultations in the emergency room improved quality of life for cancer patients . It did not find statistically significant evidence that the consultations improved rates of survival , depression , ICU admission or discharge to hospice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're seeing how palliative care in the ER can avert suffering . For instance , Ouchi recalls one patient " a man , in his late 60s " who showed up at the emergency room for the fifth time in six months with fever and back pain . Previous visits had n't addressed the underlying problem : The man was dying of cancer . <p> This time , a nurse and social worker called in a palliative care team , who talked to the patient about his goals . <p> " All he wanted was to be comfortable at home , " Ouchi says . The man enrolled in hospice , a form of palliative care for terminally i 'll patients . He died about six months later , at home . <p> Now Ouchi and others are trying to come up with systematic ways to identify which patients could benefit from palliative care . <p> One such screening tool , dubbed P-CaRES , developed at Brown University in Providence , R.I. , gives ER doctors a list of questions . Does the patient have life-limiting conditions such as advanced dementia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ER ? Would the doctor be surprised if the patient died within 12 months ? <p> Doctors are using the tool to refer patients at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center at Parnassus to palliative care doctors , says Dr. Kalie Dove-Maguire , a clinical instructor there . The questions pop up automatically on the electronic medical record for every ER patient who is about to be admitted to the hospital . <p> Dove-Maguire says UCSF has n't published results , but the tool has helped individual patients , including a middle-aged man with widespread cancer who showed up at the ER with low blood pressure . The man " would have been admitted to the ICU with lines and tubes and invasive procedures , " she says , but staff talked to his family , learned his wishes and sent him to home hospice . <p> " Having that conversation in the ER , which is the entry point to the hospital , is vital , " Dove-Maguire says . <p> Measured in minutes <p> But time is scarce in ERs . Doctors ' performance is measured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make calls to refer one patient to hospice , the more patients line up waiting for a bed . <p> Finding someone to have conversations about a patient 's goals of care can be difficult , too . Ouchi enlisted ER doctors to use the screening tool for 207 older ER patients at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , where he now works as an emergency physician . They found a third of the patients would have benefited from a palliative care consultation . But there are n't nearly enough palliative care doctors to provide that level of care , Ouchi says . <p> " The workforce for specialty palliative care is tiny , and the need is growing , " says Grudzen . <p> Palliative care is a relatively new specialty , and there 's a national shortfall of as many as 18,000 palliative care doctors , according to one estimate . <p> " We 've got to teach cardiologists , intensivists , emergency physicians , how to do palliative care , " she said . " We really have to teach ourselves the skills . "

@@37206326 @6206326/ <h> Mind , Matter And Materialism <p> Both are human endeavors aimed at articulating the nature of the world . But where the line between them lies depends a lot on perspective and history . Questions that once lay firmly in philosophy 's domain have now fully entered the realm of science . Other issues which might seem fully covered by science retain open philosophical questions that either haunt or inform ongoing research ( depending on one 's viewpoint ) . <p> One of the persistent fields where philosophy retains its purchase on science is the question of consciousness . What is it ? What does it depend on ? What , if anything , is it reducible to ? These are long-standing questions that often elicit fierce partisan responses . That partisanship was , in part , why I recently wrote an essay concerning the question of mind , matter and the perspective known as materialism . The piece appeared two weeks ago in Aeon . I 'm following up , now , on some responses that essay engendered . <p> Materialism is the idea that all phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . In popular discussions of consciousness , materialists often take what I call the " attitude of the sober . " Mind is just computing with meat , they claim , and arguing otherwise means sliding into the domains of the wooly-headed mystic , drunk on supernatural " woo . " <p> The point of my essay is straightforward . If one wants to claim that mind rests on matter , this must include admitting just how murky our understanding of matter is at the deepest levels . The murk at those deepest levels is the multiple interpretations of quantum physics . We do not yet have an agreed upon interpretation of quantum physics . That means we do not yet have an agreed upon understanding of what is matter and our relation to it . <p> Just as important , pretty much all those interpretations come with some strange ontological and epistemological baggage . Thus , each interpretation comes with its weirdness , its own departure from simple common sense ideas about reality . <p> Materialism 's claim that it alone is the obvious , the straightforward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wind from this standpoint . Why is a non-reductionist , non-materialist account for consciousness considered " crazy " but an infinite number of infinitely splitting parallel universes ( part of the materialist-favored Many Worlds interpretation ) considered sober , hard-nosed science ? If you want to see the argument laid out explicitly I refer you back to the original article in Aeon . <p> As you might imagine , there have been swift and strong reactions on all sides of the debate . And , as always , I want to say that I am really thankful for good criticism when I write a piece like this since it helps me refine my own thinking . <p> For example , some people countered it might be possible to explain mind in terms of matter without ever invoking the weirdness of quantum mechanics . In other words , perhaps one only needs classical Newtonian physics to explain how consciousness arises via complex information processing systems . This seems to be a point the very capable philosopher of science Massimo Pigliuccimade when he said mind is a biological phenomena . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this possibility . That 's because I remain agnostic as to the true nature of consciousness . It is , in fact , possible that only the " higher level " classical behavior of matter is needed to explain consciousness . On the other hand , this point has yet to be demonstrated scientifically . The trouble comes when materialists claim the reduction of consciousness to matter is " what science says . " Nobody needs me to point out that the relationship between mind and matter ( i.e. mind and brain ) remains a cutting edge and contentious topic in philosophy and science . That means you ca n't just state that mind is purely a biological phenomena as if it were a scientific fact . In fact , that statement is a really a metaphysical stance . It 's an assumption . It 's the beginning of the argument , not the end . That 's why I raised the now super-famous " Hard Problem " of consciousness . People have been arguing about it first since David Chalmers introduced it a couple of decades ago and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logical link I draw between theories of mind and theories of matter does not rely on quantum physics as an explanation for consciousness . Some folks like Rodger Penrose have argued that quantum phenomena occurring in the brain are the root of conscious experience . I am not particularly taken by these arguments ( but see this for new ideas along these lines ) . Instead , I point out that the irreducible democracy of quantum interpretations leaves the role of agency ( i.e. the observing subject ) as an open issue of contention . <p> Any explanation of mind is an account of " being a subject . " That means quantum interpretations where the epistemological aspect of quantum physics comes to the fore make simple materialist views of consciousness a whole lot less simple . Why ? Well , it 's simple . If your theory of being-a-subject ( i.e. consciousness ) relies solely on matter , but your theory of matter ca n't get rid of the subject 's being , then you 're walking on swampy ground . <p> The point here is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously . In fact , the most potent developments in quantum mechanics over the last few years come in the form of Quantum Information Theory where knowledge and knowing matter . Some of the most remarkable advances in this field like the process of weak measurement , which brings the role of the agent ( the experimenter ) front and center . <p> This does n't mean that the Copenhagen or QBist or any other " epistemological " interpretation is correct and the Many Worlds interpretation is wrong . What it does mean , however , is anyone who grounds their metaphysics on matter needs to be honest about how swampy that ground really is . <p> Of course , some folks claim I am straying into religious sentiment by merely raising the point . As University of Chicago professor Jerry Coyne put it in a blog post : " What Frank is making here is simply a sophisticated God of the Gaps argument , except that he uses the word ' something more than materialism ' rather than ' God . ' <p> The irony is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naturalist believing that no aspect of the world requires supernatural intervention . But Coyne 's reaction demonstrates the approach I was articulating and pushing back against : <p> " As I said , I 'm not a physicist , so some of Frank 's musings are beyond my ability to judge . But I 've heard plenty of respected physicists " most recently Lawrence Krauss in his new book " argue that the so-called ' observer effect ' is n't what we think it is , and is n't itself part of the laws of physics . " <p> Lawrence Krauss is a excellent cosmologist who has done really good work . But Coyne mistakes an opinion for a scientific fact " he cites someone with his same metaphysical biases . None of us know which quantum interpretation is the correct , scientifically valid one . It 's been that way for 100 years now " and that 's my whole point . <p> It 's important to realize that even the interpretations you do n't like are interesting in their own right . I am not a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fascinating and elegant in its way . And , at some point , someone might find experimental proof that it 's true ( which might happened for any of the interpretations ) . <p> So , in the end , it 's all about being upfront about our metaphysical biases and their limits . As philosopher Roberto Unger and physicist Lee Smolin put it , our job in thinking about the world is to " distinguish what science has actually found out about the world from the metaphysical commitments for which the findings of science are often mistaken . " <p> Metaphysical commitments are fine . We all have them . But when it comes to quantum physics and what it tell us about matter and materialism , we must work hard to distinguish what 's solid ground and what is swamp . <p> Adam Frank is a co-founder of the 13.7 blog , an astrophysics professor at the University of Rochester , a book author and a self-described " evangelist of science .

But instead they say they entered a racial nightmare . <p> Jackie O / Flickr/Creative Commons <p> Originally published on May 24 , 2017 1:34 pm <p> African-American students say they matriculated to Duke Divinity School expecting to enhance their calling with top-notch theological training at a prestigious program . But instead they say they entered a racial nightmare seemingly from another era , with students being called the n-word and other slurs in class , consistently receiving lower grades than their white colleagues and being fed a curriculum with no inclusion of black religious traditions . <p> The racial animus and suspicions of unequal treatment have led to numerous protests on the Durham , NC campus over the past year and created a tense school environment , where students of color feel they are targeted by other students and faculty for speaking out , according to interviews with current and former students . <p> " One of my classmates was sitting in a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her class because a student was in her class saying , ' N*ggers like you come here and think that you can just change everything . Why do n't you just learn what Jesus is really about ? ' " said Amber Burgin , president of the Black Seminarians Union who is in her third year at Duke Divinity . " We are in classes trying to pull each other out of class to hear people making inappropriate slurs , like a white student calling someone a jigaboo and then claiming they did n't know what that means . Or a white classmate calling a black classmate ' ghetto . ' ... I 've had classmates who have had to take leave ; I 've had classmates who have left the program because they were tired of being treated in such a way . " <p> Burgin stressed that the intolerant atmosphere also targets Latino and LGBTQ students . <p> " People are blatantly allowed to question the humanity of LGBTQ students and no one does anything about it , " said Burgin , 34 , who received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she matriculated at Duke Divinity . " This is a reflection of the church and the people of God 's church . Why are we teaching in a space where we are not edifying all of God 's people " or at least we say we are but then we 're treating each other like this ? " <p> Carl Kenny , a prominent African-American minister and journalist who graduated from Duke Divinity School in 1993 , said the tense racial atmosphere at the school is a byproduct of changes that have occurred in recent years as the school has increasingly come under the influence of the conservative white evangelical community inside the United Methodist Church . <p> Though it was founded in 1926 by UMC , Duke Divinity claims to have an ecumenical approach to theology and boasts on its website about the school 's commitment to diversity to " foster more faithful , hopeful , and loving forms of common life . " <p> " As a local pastor here in Durham , I witnessed the development of students coming through the divinity school over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy about the divinity school , " Kenny said . " What I witnessed over the past couple of years has been the steady decline of that type of presence . " <p> Kenny said the evangelical community has gained more influence on seminaries across the country . <p> " We have a shift in the way theological education is being taught nationwide that reflects the impact of evangelical teaching , primarily white evangelical ideas , and how they 're being pushed upon the black church , " he said . " To me it 's bigger than just racism on the campus ; it 's how it impacts the black church . When you look at seminaries across the country , the funding of those seminaries is coming from evangelical entities who are very conservative . When I arrived at Duke , there was a place for dialogue around issues of race and homosexuality . But the evangelical thrust has pushed Duke in a different direction . " <p> Kenny said he is worried that black people of faith now have such a limited presence in seminaries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . <p> " That 's my primary concern , that the future of the black church is at risk , " he said . " In the future , you no longer will have people like Jeremiah Wright and Johnny Ray Youngblood who are really centered around black liberation theology and giving a message to people about social justice . You will see the kind of conservative black pastors who support the Trump administration , with an emphasis on reconciliation without any dialogue . That 's a very dangerous place for those who are committed to the black tradition . " <p> Annette Rodriguez , who graduated from Duke Divinity earlier this month , said students of color have suffered because of the instability in the leadership of the school , which has had three deans in the past three years . <p> " That has led to a lot of disarray , " said Rodriguez , 30 , a Puerto Rican from the Bronx who got an MBA and worked in the New York business world before she answered her religious calling and went to Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming class that is black or Latino students , but there are n't faculty and staff anymore to reflect the population of minority students in the school .

The first year I was here , three years ago , the dean made a point to say there were no qualified Latino scholars to teach at Duke , that we had the only one . That was an immense falsehood . " <p> Of the school 's 42 full-time faculty members , 6 are African American , 2 are Asian , 1 is Latino and the remaining 33 are white . <p> Rodriguez said she grew weary of having to represent the non-white point of view in every class . For instance , in a class she had called American Christianity , she said she felt extremely offended when a white student announced that his ancestors had fought for the Confederacy and they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class had a teacher 's assistant who was not well-versed in talking about racism , " Rodriguez said . " As we were reading the narrative of a slave owner , I voiced disagreement with the fact that they were giving it an agreeable read , saying this woman was between a rock and a hard place in deciding whether she had to abuse her slaves . The student said even if we did n't like it , it was our job to honor his ancestors because they did n't know any better . And the teacher came to the student 's defense . We 're constantly put in these positions where it looks like we 're difficult as students because the overwhelming majority of voices are white . " <p> Burgin said with the turnover at the top , there has n't been enough attention paid to the limitations of the teacher 's assistants . <p> " A lot of TAs are not trained in classroom management , not trained in institutional bias , " she said . " For us , that was a serious issue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began comparing grades and discovered that , as a group , they were consistently receiving lower grades than their white classmates . <p> " I 've had professors question my writing skills , " Burgin said . " I got a master 's in psychology before I came to the divinity school ; I came here knowing that I know how to write . So when I got a paper back that said , ' We do n't know that your interpretation is appropriate . Did you actually read the scripture assigned ? ' My response was , ' Did you read the scripture ? ' " <p> Elaine Heath , who took over as Dean of the Duke Divinity School last fall , said she has made the concerns of students of color a priority in her first year . In an interview , Heath read from a list of relevant measures she has instituted : inviting the staff to participate in racial equity training at the school ( she said six of the school 's 52 TA 's participated " many more volunteered but there was n't space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fall to attend a training session that included training on implicit bias led by Dr. Ben Reese , Vice President in the Office for Institutional Equity at Duke ; forming a diversity and inclusion committee to work on issues of equity ; encouraging more faculty members to use anonymous grading in response to student concerns about unequal grading ( thus far two of the school 's 42 professors have agreed to use it , though Heath expects more to come on board ) ; beginning a nationwide search for two tenured faculty positions she anticipates will be filled by African Americans ( for a professor of theology and ethics and a director of the Office of Black Church Studies ) ; holding regularly " brown bag lunches " with students from the Black Seminarians Union to hear their concerns . " I 've been working on these issues all year , " Heath said . <p> Regarding the racial slurs in class , Heath said , " Of course that 's deeply offensive if these names are being used . Racial slurs are against what we stand for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure those things do n't happen in the future . " <p> Burgin said she does n't blame the new dean for the school 's problems . " With all due respect to the dean , I do n't think she is doing a bad job , " Burgin said . " I think the dean came in with one understanding of the institution she was taking over and got a completely different look when she got here . And it 's a lot to take in , to see all the levels of problems going on with the seminary . I want her to succeed because as a woman I think it 's important for us to have women in leadership at the divinity school . " <p> Fourteen of the divinity school 's 42 full-time professors are women . <p> Burgin said the school leadership must take seriously the needs of students of color . <p> " It ca n't just be when people stand up and protest ; it should be the standard , " she said . " They have to create a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the right thing to do . As they keep telling us in classes , heaven is not segregated . How are we going to teach people in the community about the love of Jesus Christ if we can not show that in the divinity school ? " <p> But a story that recently hit the national media provides a glimpse into the challenges inherent in changing the atmosphere at Duke . A Duke professor , Anathea Portier-Young , who is white , sent out an email in February encouraging her colleagues to attend a racial equity training session being sponsored by Duke Divinity " to ensure that DDS is an institution that is both equitable and anti-racist in its practices and culture , " Portier-Young wrote . But longtime professor Paul Griffiths , who is also white , sent out an email to facultyattacking the idea of the training session , saying it would be a waste of time and encouraging his colleagues not to attend . Dean Heath entered the fray , saying in a mass email that she was " proud " the school was hosting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portier-Young initiated disciplinary proceedings against Griffiths , he ultimately resigned . In a headline , the New York Times called the conflict " a battleground over political correctness . " Many students of color indicated that the episode highlighted the difficulties they faced in getting the college community to take their concerns seriously . <p> Heath said while she could n't discuss the Griffiths controversy because it 's a personnel matter , she did say that " most of our faculty seem committed to me to learning , increasing our knowledge of the history and causes of racism and what we can do to dismantle structural racism . It seems to me that most of our faculty are in favor of that . " <p> Heath , who is an elder in the United Methodist Church , said that when she was being interviewed for the dean position , the search committee made it clear that pushing the school to be a more diverse and inclusive environment was perhaps the top priority for the next dean . <p> " Not only diverse in terms of race and gender but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas before taking the Duke job . " So increasing diversity here at the school is also a priority for the university . We see it as contributing to our intellectual rigor and academic excellence . From my perspective , our school already has a diverse array of faculty across the spectrum in terms of people who consider themselves evangelical and people who certainly do n't . My own perspective is we need a variety of voices around the table in order to do our best work . We prepare people for leadership in a wide array of churches and Christian institutions . " <p> One of the most far-reaching complaints students of color have lodged involves what the school calls " field " placements . In order to learn how to serve a community , divinity school students spend time working in church communities around the country . But Burgin said black students rarely get a chance to work in black churches . <p> " There are never enough placements for black students , " she said . " Though I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going to be hired and work in institutions with people who look like us but you do n't offer opportunities for us to learn in those contexts is a problem . So they wind up sending us to spaces that are n't always safe for us . A lot of my classmates end up in rural white churches who have never seen a black person in their congregation and come back with these horrific stories , like people calling them names . " <p> Kenny said he is most concerned about the inadequacies of the field placements because it means the school is not properly preparing students of color for the communities they will be serving . <p> " It is important they have access to black churches that are committed to the black faith tradition , " he said . " I think that can be a problem , especially when right now black churches are at the crossroads when it comes to this conversation . There 's an internal discussion about whether social justice is the work of the black church . We are grappling right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important that black students who come to Duke be introduced to traditional black faith practice within those churches so they can serve black communities in a way that makes a difference . I 'm concerned in the future that 's going to be something that 's harder to find . " <p> But Dean Heath countered that for the summer of 2017 , more than 90 percent of the African-American students were granted their first or second preference for field education placements . Heath said the school just received a $80,000 grant from the United Methodist Church to give African-American students even more mentoring opportunities in African-American churches with African-American pastors . <p> " Only a very few African-American students requested but did not receive placement in African-American-led congregations due to specific student-named requirements that could not be met by the Field Education Office , " Heath said . " In fact , last summer , we had more field education placements in African-American congregations led by African American pastors than we had African-American students requesting such placements .

Here 's how it works : If you feel bad about something you did , that 's guilt . And that can be good . If you feel bad about who you are as a person , that 's shame .

You know , I just - I have no memory of my father not grabbing my mother , hugging my mother , kissing my mother , groping my mother , just telling her he loved her constantly .

It 's been the Nashville Predators . Heading into last night 's game against the Anaheim Ducks , the Predators had won 10 consecutive playoff games at home . The Ducks managed to break their streak , winning 3-2 , but a lot of credit for the Predators ' amazing run is going to the team 's fans and the electric atmosphere on the team 's home ice . Here 's Chas Sisk with member station WPLN . <p> CHAS SISK , BYLINE : Two hours before a playoff game against the Anaheim Ducks , and the party is already underway on the plaza outside Nashville 's Bridgestone Arena . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF BANGING , CHEERING ) <p> SISK : This is Smashville , and Predators fans are kicking things off by taking a sledgehammer to a junk automobile , painted over with the Ducks logo and color scheme . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF BANGING , CHEERING ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his aggression . He lives two hours away in Chattanooga and says he 's been a Preds fan since the team 's inception in the late 1990s . <p> JAY MAYFIELD : When I tell friends who are from up north that I 'm a big hockey fan and I live in Tennessee , none of them really believe me or process that it 's true . <p> SISK : They have good reason . In Tennessee , winter ice is considered a crisis , and playing the game - well , let 's just say that 's not required . <p> Can you skate ? <p> MAYFIELD : I ca n't skate to save my life . <p> SISK : But this is hockey with Nashville flair , and Mayfield loves it , the fans spewing out of the country music bars just across the street , Grammy winners like Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood singing the national anthem , pro wrestlers leading the cheers . <p> MAYFIELD : The entire experience is very distinctly Tennessee . It 's not something you 're going to see , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in D.C. or Pittsburgh or Cleveland or anywhere else . <p> SISK : This spectacle is a major reason why the Predators sold out all 41 of their home games this season , which is a big deal . A decade ago , attendance here was so poor , the team stood on the verge of relocating , either to Canada or Kansas City . Now , some experts say the Preds are the best show in the NHL . Its fans are among the loudest . And at home , the team is practically unbeatable . <p> TERRY CRISP : They thoroughly believe that when they make that noise and that chant and what they do , it boosts them , and they 're dead on right . <p> SISK : Terry Crisp is a former NHL player and coach . He 's been a broadcaster for the Predators since their inaugural season in 1998 . Back then , Crisp had to tutor fans on the rules of hockey . Now , he says , they 're as engaged as followers up north . <p> CRISP : But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift or you 're just going to go on for a shift and they start that uproar and they start that noise coming , the hair in the back of your neck rises . You get goosebumps everywhere . And they definitely pick you up . <p> SISK : Like other Sun Belt teams , the Predators have worked to spread the game through youth hockey teams and building rinks . Team officials say they now have a generation of fans who grew up on the team . But the Preds ' real age is location . The team plays in the heart of Nashville 's honky-tonk district , a place where people have come for decades to cut loose . Danny Shaklan is the Predators ' VP of marketing . <p> DANNY SHAKLAN : The party does n't start when the puck drops . The party starts , like , three hours earlier . <p> SISK : For Game 3 against the Ducks , the Predators brought in players from the city 's pro football team , the Tennessee Titans , to get the crowd riled up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped his shirt and shotgunned a beer . The game itself was tight , with the score tied late in the third period . Then the Predators amped up the pressure .

@@37206345 @6206345/ <h> Can You Copyright Your Dumb Joke ? And How Can You Prove It 's Yours ? <p> Conan O'Brien in 2016 . He is being sued by a writer who accuses him of stealing jokes . O'Brien says the idea of stealing someone else 's comedy makes him physically i 'll . <p> Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images <p> Originally published on May 24 , 2017 4:41 pm <p> " Joke theft " sounds funny . <p> Unless you 're a comedy writer and you see a late-night TV host telling a joke you wrote . Five times . <p> That 's what the writer Alex Kaseberg says happened to him in late 2014 and early 2015 , a charge disputed by Conan O'Brien and his lawyers . <p> Kaseberg is a comedy writer who has written over a thousand jokes used by Jay Leno over the last 20 years , according to court documents . On his blog , Kaseberg regularly writes posts with a dozen or more jokes " topical humor styled in two-beat form used by late-night hosts in their monologues . <p> At the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 2 , 2014 , Kaseberg posted this to his blog : " The University of Alabama-Birmingham is shutting down its football program . To which the Oakland Raiders said ; ' Wait , so you can do that ? ' " <p> In his monologue on Conan the following day , O'Brien said , " Big news in sports . University of Alabama-Birmingham has decided to discontinue its football team . Yeah . When they heard the news , New York Jets fans said , ' Wait can you do that ? It 's something you can do ? ' " <p> A month later , in January 2015 , a similar thing happened . Kaseberg posted a joke about passengers on a Delta flight fighting over the armrest ; a few hours later , O'Brien delivered a very similar joke on his show . Kaseberg tweeted a couple days later at Mike Sweeney , the head writer for Conan , saying he was " 95% sure " that he had a joke from his blog used on the show : " I 'm not upset , but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next month , Kaseberg saw O'Brien deliver two jokes very similar to ones he had posted on his site . <p> Kaseberg then said he reached Sweeney on the phone , where they had what Kaseberg called an " agonizing " conversation , in which Sweeney " angrily and loudly denied those were my jokes . He was furious that I was accusing them of stealing jokes , but most of all he was incensed that I would suggest his writers would have anything to do with my pathetic blog and its author , me , a no-name failure . " <p> In June 2015 , Kaseberg and O'Brien made very similar jokes about Caitlyn Jenner ; a month later , Kaseberg filed a lawsuit against O'Brien , his writers , executive producer , production company , TBS and Time Warner . <p> Which brings us to last week , when a U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino ruled that the case will head to court . And that means close scrutiny of late-night monologues " which are n't really designed for close scrutiny . <p> How many ways can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting one : not only because the judge evaluated the originality of a " shrinkage " joke about the Washington Monument , but because lawsuits of its kind are rare . <p> " The most surprising thing to me about this lawsuit is that it was filed in the first place , " says Aaron Perzanowski , a professor on intellectual property law at Case Western Reserve University . " When you 're talking about accusations of infringement dealing with fairly low-dollar-value creative work , we do n't see a lot of litigation . " <p> Judge Sammartino threw out the jokes about UAB football and the Delta flight ( finding in the latter case that one of O'Brien 's writers had already pitched a similar joke before the one on the blog appeared ) . That left Kaseberg with the Tom Brady Joke , the Washington Monument Joke , and the Jenner Joke , as the judge labels them . <p> The jokes written by Kaseberg and O'Brien 's staff , the judge ruled , are " sufficiently objectively virtually identical " in those three instances . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants " willfully infringed Plaintiff 's copyrights . " <p> So how much copyright protection do jokes get ? <p> In this case , the judge ruled that the jokes get a " thin " protection . That 's because , the judge writes , the copyrighted work ( Kaseberg 's jokes ) " is composed largely of ' unprotectable ' elements . ... Similarities derived from the use of common ideas can not be protected ; otherwise , the first to come up with an idea will corner the market . " <p> Let 's take a look at the Jenner Joke . <p> This was Kaseberg 's : " Three towns , two in Texas , one in Tennessee , have streets named after Bruce Jenner and now they have to consider changing them to Caitlyn . And one will have to change from a Cul-De-Sac to a Cul-De-Sackless . " <p> And O'Brien 's : " Some cities that have streets named after Bruce Jenner are trying to change the streets ' names to Caitlyn Jenner . If you live on Bruce Jenner cul-de-sac it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kind of a groaner ? Also yes . <p> But just because two things are similar does n't mean that one is a copy of the other . <p> " If you put a copy of the day 's newspaper in a room with 100 different comedy writers , you 're going to see lots of the same jokes where lots of people are circling the same formulation and often the same punchline independently , " says Perzanowski , the law professor . " That does n't mean they 're copying from each other . But people do have a tendency , when they see those similarities , to attribute that to copying rather than independent creation . " <p> " There 's a finite number of formulations of that Caitlyn Jenner cul-de-sac joke , " he adds . " You can tell it three or four different ways but they 're not very different from each other . <p> Is a lawsuit the best way to resolve joke theft ? <p> In its way , this line from the judge 's opinion is much funnier than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the jokes are merely the ideas that ( 1 ) the Washington Monument looks like a phallus and ( 2 ) the Monument may therefore respond to cold weather by shrinking . " <p> But the cognitive dissonance of a district court judge writing in legalese about this dumb joke evinces a not-dumb point : Maybe judges are n't the best judges of humor , or courts the best place to resolve ethics of comedy . <p> In 2008 , law professors Dotan Oliar and Christopher Sprigman published a paper that explored the norms comics had established to protect their intellectual property : their jokes . <p> In stand-up comedy , they write , " social norms substitute for intellectual property law . These norms track copyright law at times : for example , the major norm at work is one against publicly performing another stand-up 's joke or bit . More often than not , however , the norms deviate from copyright law 's defaults : for example , whereas copyright protects expression but not ideas , comedians ' norms protect expression as well as ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they write . " They are enforced with sanctions that start with simple badmouthing and may escalate from refusals to work with an offending comedian up to threats of , and even actual , physical violence . " <p> But even that system does n't keep everyone in line . Many extremely successful comedians are regularly accused of stealing jokes . Bob Hope used to joke that Milton Berle " never heard a joke he did n't steal . " And according to a 2007 story in Radar , comics at the Hollywood Improv in the ' 80s would use a light to signal the presence of Robin Williams , " comedy 's most notorious joke rustler " ; the comics would wrap up their sets quickly fearing that Williams would make off with their material . <p> Even if the informal system does n't nab every thief , it does offer one distinct advantage : a jury of one 's peers . <p> " In the particular instance of standup comedy , courts do not have a great wealth of prior case law or precedent to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason that I think these informal systems tend to have an advantage over the formal judicial process , " he says . " Because no one is in a better position to understand what makes a joke funny , what makes a joke original , what makes a joke commonplace , than a group of comedy writers themselves . " <p> And O'Brien is n't laughing about being called a joke-stealer . " Accusing a comedian of stealing a joke is the worst thing you can accuse them of , in my opinion , short of murder , " he said in a deposition . " I think it 's absolutely terrible . " <p> Kaseberg v. Conaco may be in court because it does n't spring from the world of standup comedy , but from the deeper pockets of television comedy .

African-American babies also face a higher risk , a study finds . <p> American Indians and Alaska Natives had a rate of 177.6 sudden unexplained infant deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013 ( down from 237.5 per 100,000 in 1995 ) compared with 172.4 for non-Hispanic blacks ( down from 203 ) , 84.5 for non-Hispanic whites ( down from 93 ) , 49.3 for Hispanics ( down from 62.7 ) and 28.3 for Asians and Pacific Islanders ( down from 59.3 ) .

Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wanted to know whether those changes were uniform across racial and ethnic groups . <p> " We had the overall picture , but no one had really taken a close look at what was happening within that , " says Sharyn Parks , an epidemiologist at the CDC and an author of the study , published Monday in Pediatrics . <p> The reasons behind those changes and why rates among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and African-Americans remain so much higher than those of non-Hispanic whites , Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders are n't known . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socioeconomic or other factors , such as prenatal or postnatal exposure to alcohol or tobacco and breast-feeding patterns .

( Quite a lot . ) <p> There 's a broad range across schools in the prevalence of suicide risk .

" It 's not just that any random kid would see it and do it , " he says . Instead , for young people who already have suicidal ideation , " if they already have those beliefs , " that could push them over the top . <p> He notes that , contrary to the stereotype , teens who are depressed and thinking about harming themselves are n't necessarily totally isolated .

That 's a neighborhood here in LA , just east of downtown . And she reports the exhibition by artist Simon Birch is unusual . <p> MANDALIT DEL BARCO , BYLINE : The 14th Factory fills an enormous building the size of a Costco warehouse . It was once the site of a Chinese import-export business . The first of many gallery spaces you enter is almost pitch black . When your eyes adjust , you see giant metal shards that look like an asteroid has imploded . At the center , you step inside a bright , almost blinding white room . It 's that bedroom from the final scene of the Stanley Kubrick classic film " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . " <p> Light floods in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . And there 's the bed where , in the movie , astronaut David Bowman lies down as an old man and transforms into a star baby . <p> SIMON BIRCH : It 's such a perfect symbol . And it 's a metaphor for the entire project . <p> DEL BARCO : Artist Simon Birch is a tall , lanky Brit . He 's a big sci-fi fan . And he says he always wanted to recreate that set piece . It took a stroke of luck to make that happen . All the models and props from 2001 had been destroyed under Kubrick 's orders , so Birch asked his architect friend Paul Kember to rebuild the set . <p> BIRCH : Paul got up from the table with a smile on his face . He says , I do n't need to watch the movie , " 2001 : A Space Odyssey , " to work out the dimensions of that room . I just need to call my uncle Tony . He said , well , my uncle Tony just happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that original room . <p> DEL BARCO : The " 2001 " room and other 14th Factory installations captivated visitors John and Susan Di Maina , Scott Meisse and his daughter Scarlett . <p> JOHN DI MAINA : Wild . <p> SUSAN DI MAINA : The white room was sort of disorienting . <p> SCOTT MEISSE : It 's otherworldly . <p> SCARLETT : It felt like it came out of a dream , like , I felt like I was in . It was very surreal . <p> DEL BARCO : Here are some of the other installations by Birch and his collaborators - architects , filmmakers and multimedia artists . A room of pitchforks hanging down overhead , giant screens with slow motion images of acrobats and a horde of Chinese men punching each other . In one room , you 're surrounded by videos of Hong Kong apartments . The camera tracks up and down the towers , making you feel as though you are floating . <p> MEISSE : It 's not like a traditional museum , that 's for sure . It 's the exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Each room it 's a distinct , immersive experience . At the center of the factory is a green lawn with a crater and swings hanging from the ceiling . Another video space projects multiple angles of a car crash , Birch 's own red Ferrari , with parts of the car 's wreckage on display . Outside , 40 salvaged airplane tails are planted in a pool like an aircraft boneyard . Birch says he came out of obscurity to create all of this . <p> BIRCH : Nobody 's ever heard of me or the projects , so it 's a weird paradigm from the ground up . And I suppose I 'm a weird artist . I 'm not trained . I did n't go to art school . I actually come from a very rough background . <p> DEL BARCO : Simon Birch grew up in the English midlands , where he was a club DJ known for throwing raves . From his violent neighborhood of hooligans , Birch made his way to Hong Kong to work in construction . In his spare time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to paint my mates that I worked with , who were Chinese gangsters covered in tattoos , and so quite realist , figurative work .

@@37206397 @6206397/ <p> Close-up of tzoallis being made during a summer nutrition workshop held by Puente a la Salud , a group based in Oaxaca , Mexico , that is helping to push an amaranth comeback . An ancient Aztec staple , tzoallis are made of amaranth and corn flour , agave honey and amaranth cereal . <p> Farmers participate in a trust-building exercise at an organic fertilizer workshop in the Mixteca region of Oaxaca , Mexico . Most of Puente 's farmer partners practice what 's known as agroecological farming " which prizes maintaining biodiversity " or are " in transition " to these methods . <p> In 2016 Puente staffers and volunteers made a 12-meter-square tlayuda , incorporating amaranth flour , cereal , seeds or leaves in every layer " the biggest ever of its kind , according to the National Group for Amaranth Promotion in Mexico . <p> Courtesy of Puente a la Salud Comunitaria <p> On a sunny Friday morning in San Pablo Huitzo , a town in the Valles Centrales region of Oaxaca , Mexico , a half-dozen women are gathered for a workshop on making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped amaranth seeds . Their ingredient list is short : water , honey , raisins , a form of raw cane sugar known as piloncillo , and lime juice . <p> " The trick , " explains the event 's gracious host , Maria Lopez , " is to get the syrup to the right temperature " before adding the tiny orbs of amaranth , each barely bigger than a grain of coarse sand . <p> This could be any chatty gathering of neighborhood cooks in any kitchen in the world , except that in Oaxaca , amaranth is not just a fad ingredient . The ancient indigenous plant is part of a movement to revive native crops and cuisines , and a means of restoring the physical health and economy of their state , one of the poorest in Mexico . <p> The alegr+a gathering is one of six weekly microenterprise workshops that the nonprofit Puente a la Salud Comunitaria ( Bridge to Community Health ) holds with 25 different groups in Oaxaca . Founded in 2003 by two American volunteers in Oaxaca seeking a solution to the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Puente quickly hit on the idea of reintroducing amaranth into the local diet , explains Pete Noll , the organization 's executive director . <p> High in protein and other nutrients , amaranth is also drought-resistant and profitable , netting local farmers three to five times the profit of other locally grown grain crops . <p> Puente soon began working with small farmers to strengthen local economies through the sustainable cultivation of amaranth , known as amaranto in Spanish . As national obesity rates rose precipitously " Mexico has surpassed the U.S. in the number of overweight adults " Puente took on fighting both malnutrition and obesity . To date , the organization has worked with 6,000 families in over 80 communities to help incorporate amaranth and other healthy foods into their diet . <p> In ancient Mesoamerica amaranth was known as huautli , meaning " the smallest giver of life , " and was grown in large quantities similar to that of maize . When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century , amaranth all but disappeared from the native diet . No one knows for sure why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deities made of amaranth , corn and honey " and perhaps laced with human blood " were a pagan threat to Spanish Catholicism . <p> Back at the Lopez household , after the alegr+a ingredientshave been mixed , the women spread the mixture on a sheet of buttered paper held in a wooden frame , cut it into squares and taste the final product . The verdict : universal thumbs up . The next steps , explains Hope Bigda-Peyton , Puente 's director of development and sustainability , will be for the group to figure out costs , pricing and profit margins . Once they 've developed their packaging and logo , they can sell their alegr+as at local markets and restaurants , or at the two amaranth specialty shops that Puente operates . <p> Not far from where Lopez lives , in the town of Suchilquitongo , tender young amaranth leaves sprout between rows of corn on Minerva Cruz 's farm . One of close to 250 farmers that Puente works with , Cruz is in her third year of cultivating amaranth . " It 's a very noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what caught my attention , " she explains . <p> Cruz has lent her farm to Puente for five years to serve as an amaranth processing center . Thanks to a federal grant , the farm recently got prototype machines that thresh and clean the plant 's seeds , which has vastly increased efficiency . It " is a really big step forward for Puente , " Noll says . <p> In the brick warehouse adjacent to the machines , Gerardo Lopez , head of Puente 's agricultural extension program , shows how each bag of amaranth seeds is carefully labeled to indicate the varietal it contains and how it was grown . Most of Puente 's farmer partners practice what 's known as agroecological farming " which prizes maintaining biodiversity " or are " in transition " to these methods . <p> Farmers like Cruz who grow amaranth have also developed a repertoire of recipes for the plant . Although the seed , flour and leaves of the bushy plant can all be consumed , cereal ( the popped seeds ) is the most commonly used form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves to water and blend them with lime peel to make an agua fresca . <p> Last summer , to promote the use of amaranth in cooking , Puente partnered with well-known Oaxaca City chefs to create new dishes featuring amaranth . Pilar Cabrera of La Olla created an amaranth leaf and grain salad , amaranth sweet bread , breaded amaranth chicken and an amaranth smoothie . Rodolfo Castellanos of Origen created a hamburger on an amaranth bun and a chocolate cake topped with amaranth cereal and red plum ice cream . <p> Puente 's farmer network has so far exported to only one source outside the country , Toronto 's ChocoSol Traders . There , founder Michael Sacco and chef Chrystal Porter are perfecting a recipe for a " complete-protein tortilla , " made with amaranth , chia seeds and maize . <p> At Las Quinces Letras in Oaxaca City , chef/owner Celia Flori+n has hosted amaranth cooking demonstrations by women farmers . She also likes to highlight amaranth and other traditional ingredients prepared in healthy and delicious ways , like her sublimely refreshing agua fresca , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bits of lime peel and popped amaranth seeds . Another favorite dish involves blanching amaranth leaves in hot water , squeezing them dry , coating them with beaten egg , breading and frying them . The dish is served with a salsa of pumpkin seeds , or in soup . <p> " We encourage water over soda at the restaurant , " says Flori+n . " Gradually people 's mindsets are changing " to healthier behaviors . <p> Susana Trilling runs a cooking school in Oaxaca . " I work with a lot of women from the mountains , and they use amaranth to make fritters and soups , " she says . " They boil the leaves in a clay pot with onion and garlic , and it 's always served with hard-boiled egg and Mexican rice . " <p> Trilling has taught some of these recipes at her school , and incorporates fresh amaranth in the summer months as part of her staff breakfast with hard-boiled eggs . " Especially during the amaranth appreciation campaign , " she adds , " people got excited " about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crepes , and in wafers Trilling makes with her students with amaranth flour and coconut . <p> If all these delicious uses are not enough to convince Oaxacans to consume more amaranth , Puente has another enticement up its sleeve . <p> Every October , on " Amaranth Day , " it sponsors the making of a giant tlayuda , a popular street food made by topping a corn tortilla with beans , cheese and chopped cabbage . In 2016 Puente made a 12-meter-square tlayuda , incorporating amaranth flour , cereal , seeds or leaves in every layer " from the tortilla dough to the topping of toasted grasshopper , avocado , radish and salsa . <p> " We thought it would last longer than it did !

NPR has done anniversary retrospectives before , including a huge look-back on the 20th . But in the past five years , the issue of policing " how it 's done , whether it 's equitable , what happens when deadly confrontations occur " has become more urgent than ever . And what happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical part of the current national conversation on policing and race . For the LAPD , there have been huge changes . <p> " I can honestly say the LAPD of 2017 is not your grandfather 's LAPD , and it 's not the LAPD of Daryl Gates , that 25 years ago , plunged this city into the biggest riot in ( modern ) American history , " says civil rights lawyer Connie Rice . Rice spent a lot of time from the late 1980s through the mid-90s challenging police aggression in the city 's communities of color , especially people in poor parts of the city where policing was designed less to protect and serve , more to contain and suppress . <p> Like Parker 's LAPD , the organization under Daryl Gates was especially hard on communities of color . <p> For years before the ' 92 riots , Rice says , cops felt comfortable denigrating black and brown people over their radios . When the transcripts of those conversations were introduced in court cases , Rice says , " they raised the veil on the subterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Latino community and any community that they decided was n't on the right side of the thin blue line . " <p> Being brown or black automatically made one suspect to beat officers , says writer Joe Domanick , who has spent much of his career reporting on the LAPD , as well as chronicling its evolution in his book Blue . " The LAPD was doing stop and frisk long before it was ever labeled stop and frisk , " Domanick insists . This meant the department 's infamous arbitrary stops " where police would roll up on a subject , jump out and make him " assume the position " ( on their knees , hands behind the head , or " proned out " on the ground , face down ) " often targeted law-abiding black and brown citizens . Workers . Teachers . Ministers . Anyone they felt merited a closer look . Several decades of these stops , and the brutality that often accompanied them if the person stopped asked why he was being stopped , contributed to a deep well of resentment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So when the verdict from a mostly white jury came back , the fury was n't just at the apparent miscarriage of justice . There was plenty of that " the videotape of King 's beating had circulated globally ; many felt a conviction was a slam-dunk . The rage was in opposition to decades of police mistreatment suffered by people who were n't named Rodney King . <p> In June , after the ashes cooled and Gates was forced to resign , the city got a new chief . An African-American one . Willie Williams arrived from Philadelphia and served one term . Most of the rank and file did n't want a black chief , and were offended that an outsider had been chosen to lead them . Williams did get some of his cops out of their cars and on the streets , and introduced the idea of community policing . But it was n't enough . He was seen as a weak , ineffective leader and was gone in one term . <p> The next chief was harder to dismiss . Bernard Parks was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was also African-American . Unlike Williams , Parks was tall and trim and looked every inch the LAPD cop . ( He was even named one of People Magazine 's 50 Most Beautiful in 1998 . ) And like Gates , Parks was an authoritarian . His handling of the worst police scandal in modern LAPD history eventually cost him his job . <p> Jody David Armour , who teaches and writes about the nexus of race and the criminal justice system at the University of Southern California 's Gould School of Law , says it 's hard to conceive exactly how devastating the Rampart scandal was to the LAPD . " Try to imagine taking LA Confidential , Serpico and Training Day and rolling them all into one , " Armour says , " and you still do n't have the magnitude of the Rampart scandal . " <p> In the Rampart scandal , several cops from an elite , anti-gang unit were supposed to infiltrate the criminal element that was preying on the mostly-immigrant communities Rampart served . Instead of tracking the bad guys though , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured suspects and sold cocaine they 'd stolen from police evidence rooms . Parks oversaw an investigation into the scandal , and some police were prosecuted . But despite those convictions , many felt the investigation did n't go far enough . The LAPD was forced to accept federal oversight while it overhauled itself and Parks was denied a second term . It was time for another outsider . <p> Enter Chief William Bratton , who 'd policed New York City until his good press got under the thin skin of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani . " Broadway Bill " " a cheeky reference to the chief 's love of publicity " had lowered crime using data-based policing , which analyzed information about where crimes occurred , and then dispatched adequate numbers of police to those areas to suppress it . Quality of life issues improved : a lot of homeless were hustled off the streets , the " squeegee men " who accosted drivers near tunnels and bridges demanding to clean their windshields , disappeared , the subways were safer . But vast numbers of minority New Yorkers , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop-and-frisk tactics . Bratton brought his data-based policing to Los Angeles , but LA was n't New York " for one thing , there was way more real estate to cover by a relatively small police force . <p> Armour says Bratton had to adjust his methods to his new city : " He had to develop a more community-oriented policing model , and found that actually improving those community-police relationships was consistent with good law enforcement practices , cause crime went down . " Bratton also engaged the LAPD 's nemesis , Connie Rice , to help him change the department 's culture . At Bratton 's behest , Rice got carte blanche to interview hundreds of working police officers , who told her what the challenges and potential rewards could be to changing how the LAPD operates . <p> There was an active effort to recruit beyond the previous white male standard . " And as more cops of color came in , you had more progressive ideas , " Rice believes . " They also stopped simply taking military people . They looked for teachers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it was a different mix of recruitment . " <p> Bratton stayed for seven years , and left , having pointed to a hand-picked successor , Charlie Beck . <p> Beck is the son of an LAPD officer and husband of another . Two of his children and a son-in-law are also LAPD . Beck , who oversaw and rebuilt Rampart post-scandal , wanted his officers to have the flexibility to handle things out in the field as each situation demanded . No more calling back to HQ for permission to deviate . He wanted them policing in ways that they did n't themselves become the news . ( Sometimes that worked , sometimes it did n't . ) He also approved of several pilot projects in the city 's sprawling housing projects , engaging lead residents with police officers to form community police partnerships to fight crime and reduce conflict both within and between different projects . " They serve the poor community instead of terrorizing it , " Rice says . <p> Beck does n't do this from Parker Center . No shrine to any past chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plain-wrap name : The Police Administration Building . And because crime is significantly lower than it was in the 90s , Beck says , his people have more latitude to try different ways to police .

So I think that 's why you see us being able to emphasize trust at a greater rate than our predecessors did . " <p> Some of that trust has been dented in the past few years , because of a number of police shootings of unarmed people of color . " There are relatively fewer than there used to be , " says Joe Domanick , " but there are still questionable shootings . " Even after police training and shooting policy were changed . <p> It may not change fully for another few years . If Charlie Beck stays till the end of his second term that , combined with Bill Bratton 's previous tenure will have given LA 17 years of reform . Maybe still not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under Daryl Gates . LA 's black and brown communities , says Rice , " have had a hundred years of abuse .

Rodney King . <p> CORNISH : On April 29 , 1992 , a mostly white jury acquitted four police officers in the beating of Rodney King . For many African-Americans who lived in South LA , the verdict was an outrage . And that outrage turned into violence . The LA riots lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of conversations today about race and policing . <p> Our co-host Kelly McEvers , along with Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team , went to the place where the riots began . <p> KELLY MCEVERS , BYLINE : OK . So we are at the corner of Florence and Normandie . We 're standing next to a place called Tom 's Liquor . And we 've been out here a few times . And earlier when we were here at this intersection talking about the importance of the riots , we met this guy who gave us this really interesting perspective of , like , how the police here in LA have changed . His name was , Jimmy , right , Karen ? <p> KAREN GRIGSBY BATES , BYLINE : It was . And he was concerned about his safety , so he did n't want to give us his last name . He 's close to 50 . He 's been out in the streets for a while . He was from Compton but he has a lot of friends in this neighborhood , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riots . Over the years , he 's had a lot of run-ins with the police , including about seven months ago . He said they 're different now than they were 25 years ago . <p> JIMMY : The police , they respect you now because they 're fearing their job . <p> BATES : Are you afraid of the police because ... <p> JIMMY : No . <p> BATES : Were you afraid in ' 92 ? <p> JIMMY : I used to be . I 'm not anymore . <p> MCEVERS : And one reason Jimmy said he 's not as afraid anymore is his age . I mean , he 's not out in the streets as much as he was when he was younger . And the other reason is this . <p> JIMMY : You remember the feds went in , they had ... <p> MCEVERS : You think the feds having oversight over the police is a good thing ? <p> JIMMY : Yes . Yes . <p> BATES : Yeah . Jimmy 's talking about the federal consent decree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had a lot to do with changing the way the LAPD interacted with all of its citizens . It was integral to the reform of the police department . <p> The riots and federal oversight were two watershed moments for the LAPD . But to understand how the LAPD changed , we have to start with what happened at this intersection 25 years ago . <p> MCEVERS : Right . So what happened ? <p> BATES : So the jury acquits the four policemen charged with beating Rodney King . <p> MCEVERS : Right . <p> BATES : Black LA was furious . People got angrier and angrier . More and more people came out into the street . And eventually , some young guys broke into a bunch of the liquor stores that are in this neighborhood , including this one that we 're leaning up against . <p> MCEVERS : Yeah . <p> BATES : And things escalated quickly from there . They started throwing cans and bottles . Some pulled panicked passing drivers out of their cars and assaulted them . <p> MCEVERS : One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , especially at the beginning . You actually talked to somebody who was there at the time . He 's a reporter named Joe Domanick . Let 's take a listen to that . <p> JOE DOMANICK : One of the most astounding things about the 1992 Los Angeles riots was the response of the LAPD , which is to say no response at all . <p> BATES : Part of the reason there was n't a response was because there was n't a plan . Police brass , divorced from what was happening at street level , did n't anticipate social unrest on a major scale . No orders were coming from police headquarters at Parker Center to tell cops what to do . It was a mistake that led to the riots spreading well beyond Florence and Normandie . <p> DOMANICK : They were watching it all but they were not stopping it . <p> BATES : Joe Domanick says that 's how the LAPD worked back then . It was a legacy of Chief William Parker , who ran the department from 1950 to 1966 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV shows . In 1992 , his protege , Darryl Gates , was in charge . <p> Like Parker , Gates was an absolute authoritarian . He ran the department like an Eastern European dictator . Joe Domanick says Daryl Gates 's LAPD , like Parker 's , was especially hard on communities of color . <p> DOMANICK : The Los Angeles Police Department was doing stop-and-frisk long before it was ever labeled stop-and-frisk . <p> BATES : The stops were abrupt , humiliating and often done in full view of a spouse or child or neighbors . Each stop added to a deep well of community resentment . When the Rodney King verdict came down , it was on . <p> DOMANICK : It was bad for the city . It was bad for business . You ca n't have a city going up in flames twice in 30 years because of their police department . <p> BATES : Gates 's LAPD , Domanick says , did n't fit with the powerbrokers ' vision of a 21st century metropolis that could draw visitors and businesses from around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of race and criminal justice at the University of Southern California 's law school . <p> Armour says the ' 92 riots were a wake-up call but the bigger changes happened in 1998 , when a huge LAPD scandal made national news . <p> JODY DAVID ARMOUR : Try to imagine taking " L.A. Confidential , " " Serpico " and " Training Day , " rolling them all into one and you still do n't have the magnitude of the Rampart scandal . <p> BATES : The Rampart Division of the LAPD oversaw one of the most densely populated parts of the city . The residents had been victimized by gangs and violent crime for years , so an elite anti-gang unit was tasked with covertly gathering intelligence on the bad guys . <p> But when it was revealed that several cops at Rampart had actually become bad guys - assaulting suspects and selling confiscated drugs - a civilian commission recommended a consent decree for federal oversight . Jody Armour . <p> ARMOUR : Crime actually fell while the LAPD was under the consent decree , showing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more zero-tolerance approach to have effective law enforcement that reduced crime . <p> BATES : Ironically , this scandal happened on the watch of Bernard Parks , the city 's second black police chief . Lawyer and activist Connie Rice worked with Parks 's replacement , New Yorker Bill Bratton , to change police culture . She knew there was too much to lose if things did n't change . <p> CONNIE RICE : Every single riot in this city was triggered by law enforcement . <p> BATES : Rice 's sunny patio is a far cry from the bleak public housing projects where she spent a lot of her time . In her work with both Bratton and the current LAPD chief , Rice says she 's found a willingness to engage poor neighborhoods and police-community partnerships . These have kept the peace and built trust with many residents . <p> RICE : They serve the poor community instead of terrorizing and tormenting and arresting a third of the men in a community , which is what LAPD and the sheriffs did . <p> BATES : That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chief says crime rates today are lower than they were in the ' 90s and this gives his people more latitude . <p> CHARLIE BECK : Rather than just chase the symptoms that are crime all day long , we can work on the root causes . And so I think that that 's why you see us emphasize trust at a greater rate than our predecessors did . <p> MCEVERS : That was Karen Grigsby Bates of our Code Switch team . I 'm Kelly McEvers . We 're still standing at the intersection of Florence and Normandie . Karen , it sounds like the police have thought about how to be better and there has been some progress in the LAPD since the riots , yeah ? <p> BATES : Yes , there has been but there are - also been questionable police shootings in the past few years , as in other places . So last week , Kelly , LA 's civilian police commission voted to require LAPD officers to try deescalating situations before firing their guns whenever possible . <p> MCEVERS : Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , we 're going to hear about another part of the LA riots that we do n't always hear a lot about and that is what happened to some of the Latinos who were arrested . 
@@37206400 @6206400/ <h> Earth Day And The March For Science <p> This Saturday , April 22 , people from around the country will gather in Washington , D.C. , to join the March for Science ( there will also be satellite marches in many cities ) . <p> After the march was first announced , I wrote on some of the issues it raised about politics and science " and why I was planning to attend . ( I will be attending the march and will be giving a " teach-in " with planetary scientists David Grinspoon and Ellen Stofan titled Climate Change and the Cosmic Perspective . ) The piece generated a lot of conversations online and in person . <p> One of the people I spoke with was Kathleen Rogers , the president of Earth Day Network , an organization taking a lead role in staging the march . ( Earth Day is also April 22 this year . ) Rogers is an attorney who has spent 20 years focusing on environmental public policy and law . <p> I thought it would be good to ask Rogers " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Environmental Law Institute , and two U.S. Olympic organizing committees " about the links between Saturday 's event and Earth Day in general , as well as economics and the angry state of U.S. scientists . <p> What follows is an edited version of our conversation . <p> So how is the Science March different from the yearly Earth Day activities ? <p> Well , let 's face it . There is no Earth Day without science . But we should really go back to before 1970 and that first Earth Day . If it were n't for the deep science that was giving us the warnings about our air and our water back then , there would n't have been an Earth Day . <p> I 'm a student of the Industrial Revolution . By 1970 , 100-plus years of industrial society had left a long trail . It was in the decade or so before 1970 that people recognized the links between asthma and air pollution and water quality and disease . So the science started piling on until people could n't ignore it . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in Congress . The people in charge of making laws <p> There was n't a big environmental community back then . Before Earth Day there were basically just movements for conservation , which was about preserving species either for hunting or for using as some kind of natural resource . Earth Day marked the beginning of the modern environmental movement , which also had a big focus on public health , and all of it was driven by science . <p> So what does your organization , Earth Day Network , do ? <p> Earth Day Network was born out of the first Earth Day . We mainly focus on year-round programs . One of the centerpieces of our work is environmental education . We 're now in 192 countries and have , for example , three offices in India . We work all year long on things like the green economy , renewable energy and other issues depending on local needs . <p> Where does your funding come from ? <p> The usual suspects : individuals ; foundations ; sometimes the federal government ; sometimes corporations give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also worked with cities to create environmental curricula . <p> So how is it connected to the March for Science ? <p> We 'll , we 're heading toward the 50th anniversary of Earth Day " and last year we came up with five themes we wanted to work on as we head to that milestone . One of these was reforestation . We 'll be working with governments around the world to plant 7.8 billion trees , one for each person on the planet in 2020 . <p> But another theme we 're working on is global climate and science literacy . The reason we 're doing this is threefold . There 's information you want people to have about what 's really happening with climate . Then there 's the value people get from understanding this is happening . And finally " and I 'm a huge fan of this " it 's about jobs . So when the idea of the March for Science came up , it just seemed to fit in with our own priorities . The march organizers and we ended up in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Environmentalism often gets tagged as being anti-business . <p> Oh my God . We 're not that at all . This harkens back to my obsession with the Industrial Revolution . I had a great-grandfather who was an inventor . He was a good friend of Alexander Graham Bell . <p> Really ? That 's cool . What did he invent ? <p> He had a bunch of patents . He invented carbon paper , underground cabling and other things . His name was Lebbeus H. Rogers ; look him up . <p> Anyway , because of that history in my family , we 're all students of the Industrial Revolution . And you know what happened back then . There were a bunch of people inventing things in their garages " just like now . The U.S. ended up owning a lot of the technology back then because we were the ones inventing it . We became a superpower in part because of those inventions . But because I work all over the world , I 'm now seeing countries move ahead of us with technology . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march is political , it sounds like you 're saying no " but it is economic . <p> It 's like we 're giving up the Industrial Revolution to China or some other country . The people who own this green technology will end up owning the world just like in the Industrial Revolution . And whether anyone likes it or not , the world is heading in that renewables direction . So it makes no sense from a business perspective . For solar and wind the market numbers are stunning . So why are n't we owning it ? <p> Earth Day is about that , too . <p> India , Oman , Italy , Morocco and all these other countries that are moving in the direction of renewable energy systems are interested in promoting environmental , climate and technology education . Why are they doing this ? Because they want investments . They see all of it in terms of jobs for the future . <p> So whether you 're talking about health or jobs or landscape values , mining coal and burning oil is just so 1800s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buggy for the car . If you want to create the next generation of Carnegies , Rockefellers and Edisons you have to go this way " or you are going to lose . <p> Some people fear the march will politicize science . What do you see going on out there in people 's motivation for the march ? <p> Well , for years scientists have worked both behind and in front of the scenes when it comes to policy . What 's happening now is unique and different . Hell has no fury like a scientist whose integrity is questioned . These folks are n't making hundreds of millions of dollars . They 're not billionaires . They 're working at government rates so to speak . They are giving their lives to their work and have one thing to hang on to " the truth and their integrity . And it 's the backbone of American science and technology we 're talking about here . It 's not just lab people , but everyone from computer programmers to people working on cancer . All these people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not my constituency . I mean we have lots of scientists involved in our work , but what 's motivating this march goes way beyond us . The people who are talking about the march go way beyond the usual environmental crowd . So what I see is it 's more than just about shutting down climate satellites . We need to take care of the science in this country " or the scientists , especially the young ones , will just go somewhere else to do their work . <p> Adam Frank is a co-founder of the 13.7 blog , an astrophysics professor at the University of Rochester , a book author and a self-described " evangelist of science .

@@37206413 @6206413/ <h> Autism And The Drive To Explain And Explore <p> Young kids are known for exploration and explanation ; they poke and they prod , they open and push , they ask : " Why ? Why ? Why ? " <p> Some people describe these drives to explore andexplain as a key characteristic of our species ; others highlight their intimate role in learning . It 's of particular interest , then , to understand the basis for exploration and explanation-seeking , and to investigate how they affect the way we interact with the world . <p> A paper by researchers M.D. Rutherford and Francys Subiaul , recently published in the journal Autism , offers a fresh approach to investigating our exploratory and explanatory drives by testing whether two populations of children " those diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) and those without known developmental delays " differ in how they explore and seek explanations in physical and social domains . The results suggest that children with ASD have a heightened drive to explain " but only in the physical domain . <p> To address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of children responded to a surprising situation that arose in the course of a physical task ( balancing blocks ) versus a social task ( requesting stickers from an adult ) . In each case , one group of children ( ages 3-10 ) had a confirmed diagnosis of ASD , and a control group ( age 4 ) had no history of developmental delays . While children in the two groups differed in chronological age , they were matched in terms of " mental age , " as determined by a battery of standard verbal and nonverbal tests . <p> In the first experiment , the 18 children in the ASD group and the 21 children in the control group learned to balance wooden blocks that were decorated to look like dogs , with the children told to " stand them up on their feet . " After several successful attempts , the experimenter provided a block that looked just like those that had previously balanced , but that contained a surreptitious weight . The weighted block would n't balance , presenting children with an unexpected event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experimenters recorded what the children did . Did they explore the block manually ? Did they touch the table ? Did they ask an adult for help , or request an explanation for why it would n't balance ? <p> The researchers found that overall , the children from the ASD group engaged in more exploratory and explanatory behaviors than children in the control group . For example , they were significantly more likely to touch the table , to ask a why-question and to offer a physical explanation for the problem . <p> These findings are consistent with one hypothesis about autistic cognition , according to which people with ASD tend to approach the world by " systematizing " " trying to figure out how systems work . But this system-deciphering tendency goes hand-in-hand with a tendency to engage in less " mental " reasoning : ASD is associated with less social engagement , including less eye contact and less facility in reasoning about other people 's mental states . This suggests that a heightened explanatory drive might be restricted to physical systems , such that a comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavior . <p> A second experiment tested this prediction by presenting 17 children with ASD and 15 children in a control group with a social analogue to the physical task . Rather than balancing wooden blocks , children requested stickers from an adult by putting out their hand . After a few successful attempts , the adult with stickers ignored the request , pretending to be totally preoccupied with the stickers themselves . Again , the researchers recorded how the children responded to this unexpected event . Would they try to request a sticker once again ? Ask another adult for help ? Look at the stickers or the faces of the adults involved ? <p> For this social version of the task , there was no evidence that the children with ASD had a heightened drive to explore or explain . They were no more likely than the control kids to engage in any of the recorded behaviors , and in fact significantly less likely to repeat the hand gesture to request a sticker , to attempt to get the adults ' attention in another way , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . One interpretation , then , is that children with ASD may have a heightened drive to explain in some domains , but not when it comes to the social world . <p> These studies are among the first to investigate how children with ASD seek explanations , so it 's worth being cautious about drawing strong conclusions . For example , it 's hard to know whether children with ASD were less motivated to explore and explain in the social domain , or equally motivated but less able to effectively do so . It 's also difficult to interpret differences between small groups of children who differ in a number of ways , including their chronological age , or to interpret differences across the physical and social tasks , which varied in more than domain . <p> That said , these findings raise a number of intriguing possibilities that merit further study . To what extent is our drive to explain domain-general , versus bound to particular domains ? To what extent is explanation-seeking a universal human characteristic , versus one associated more or less with particular populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do differences in exploration and explanation affect our experience of the world and what we learn from it ? <p> We do n't yet know the answers to these questions , but as an exploration and explanation-driven species , we 're on our way to finding out . <p> Tania Lombrozo is a psychology professor at the University of California , Berkeley .

@@37206416 @6206416/ <h> A Conversation About Who Needs College And Why <p> So Michel is away today because she spent this week in Madison , Wisc. , home of the University of Wisconsin 's flagship campus . Michel was doing a live event in collaboration with member station WPR for our series Going There with Michel Martin . In this installation , the questions being asked were why college and who needs college ? <p> In front of a live audience , Michel and her guests debated the value , the costs and purpose of higher education in today 's world . She was onstage with a panel of students from the University of Wisconsin at Madison as well as alumni and key players in the University of Wisconsin system . The students were up first . <p> You 're going to hear from Brooke Evans . She 's been homeless for much of her college career and has become an activist for low-income students . She even helped bring a food pantry to the Madison campus . Also junior Sam Park - he 's a neurobiology and sociology major and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaitlynne Roling was also there . She 's a sophomore from the Madison area , and , finally , you 'll hear from senior Deshawn McKinney . He is the president of the Wisconsin Student Union . Michel starts by asking Brooke Evans why she wanted to attend college in the first place . <p> BROOKE EVANS : So why did I want to come to college ? I know - I can tell you for a fact that I did n't think people like me went to college , and I grew up with that narrative . Brooke , you 're supposed to go work in a foundry because my mother worked in a foundry and her mother worked in a foundry . They were all single - single mothers . And I absolutely thought that that was going to be my future . <p> And , yeah , I watched my mom - I think - spent a decade going back to college starting at a tech school and then doing UW-Stout online . And I do n't know if anyone knows what it sounds like when - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she used to wear steel-toed boots when she worked in the foundry . And she would leave real early in the morning - right ? - she 'd leave at like 4 in the morning . And so I listened to those footsteps , and then as she went through college , her footsteps became high heels . <p> And so the sounds of my mother felt like listening to what freedom must sound like . And I realized I wanted to have footsteps like that . I wanted to have something with purpose , and I knew I could leave college at any moment and go be someone 's something . I could be someone 's wife , be someone 's mother , be someone 's thing - right ? - be an instrument for someone else 's life and someone else 's plan because it 's just too damn hard to have my own . And I 'm so grateful that for some gosh darn reason I 'm back here again . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> MICHEL MARTIN , BYLINE : Sam , why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to college ? When you were telling me earlier - and those - I know everybody here listens to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED every day , so I do n't even need to say this . But , Sam , you were nice enough to take time out of your schedule to come over and talk to us for a little bit to just kind of get us - get our conversation started . <p> And one of the things you were telling us is you grew up three blocks from here , but most of the kids from your neighborhood do n't go to college . Why is that ? <p> SAM PARK : Well , I think there 's a lot of reasons . Even before college starting in elementary school , K through five , you see that , oh , we 're the kids that , you know , we had not enough clothes at home , not enough food at home , not enough warmth at home if we did have a home . And those are things that sometimes outweigh the , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have these other factors in play in your life , oftentimes faculty , teachers , advisers do n't understand that , do n't see that , and they see you as a waste of their time . <p> MARTIN : OK . Well , we 'll talk more about that in a couple minutes . Deshawn , what about you ? You 're about to go out into - I was going to see the real world , but you 're going to grad school , so ... <p> DESHAWN MCKINNEY : Yeah . Not quite . <p> MARTIN : Not really . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> MARTIN : Sorry . But you 're about to go Forth - Sally Forth . Do you feel you 've got what you came for ? <p> MCKINNEY : Absolutely . Well , I think yes and no . I did n't know what I came for . Right ? So in some ways , I ca n't really say yes because I think I do n't know what I 'm doing yet . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> MCKINNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and I think that I 've had a very unique one , particularly for like a student of color on a predominately white institution like Madison , right ? Forty-three thousand students - only 2 percent of those are black , right ? So like most of the black students on campus are sitting onstage right now , right ? <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> MCKINNEY : So like I say that in jest , but it is like an actual thing . Like , there 's 2 percent out of 43,000 . That 's a problem . So - but I look at my experience , I think I 've had a very unique one , right ? Like , I 've taken advantage of every opportunity possible . I know that I 've given as much to the university as I 've taken from the university . <p> And , like , I 'm really focused on , like , making sure other people get those experiences . I know I 'm graduating in May having no regrets . And I think that 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color , somebody coming from a low-income background , somebody coming from the inner city of Milwaukee , you know , from the North side . So , like , I feel very satisfied . I 've had a beautiful college experience in many ways . <p> MARTIN : Are we friends now ? <p> MCKINNEY : We 're good . <p> MARTIN : Are we all friends ? No . I 'll tell you why because I 'm going to ask a hard question now . You 're going to be mad . <p> MCKINNEY : Oh . <p> MARTIN : All right . Are we friends ? OK . Let me talk about this whole political correctness thing , OK ? Because we need to chew on this . The argument is that this is the special snowflake generation that spends a very great deal of time parsing issues around identity . And I 'm sure - I know that a lot of people feel this way because we see this in comment boards . We see this in letters to the editor . They feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a luxury that this country can not afford . <p> And I 'm guessing you all have thoughts about this . So Kaitlynne , I 'm going to go to you first on this because you 're taking a class that made it into the news called the problems of whiteness . One of the state lawmakers called the class garbage . And tell me why you think that it 's not . <p> KAITLYNNE ROLING : So , like , I 'm mixed so , like , even though , like , he 's in the 2 percent , I 'm in like a 3 percent . So there 's a couple more of us on campus . So I 'm part white and part black , so it was interesting growing up learning just one side of history , and then you - because , like , when you look back at history , there 's different lenses , you know ? They 're like - OK so if I want to learn about civil rights movement - all right . Let me put on some black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some women lenses , you know , just like how you look at history . <p> And so , like , growing up , like , K through 12 , you only know one lens . And that frankly is predominately white , male-type of lens . And - but that 's , like , their perspective , so , like , kind of taking this whiteness class , like , learning more in depth about that and , like , the side that they did n't want you to know , you know ? <p> Like , you do n't learn about how capitalism ties in with racism . You do n't learn the - all these intersections of race , class , gender and all that stuff like that . So when people say , like , this is , like , not why we should be on campus , I think , well , we all come from different backgrounds , you know ? You can come from Milwaukee . You can come from , you know , the East Coast . You can come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn those experiences from each other . Taking these classes has really helped me find myself . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> SINGH : That was Michel Martin with UW , Madison students Kaitlynne Roling , Deshawn McKinney , Sam Park and Brooke Evans . In the second half of the event , Michel spoke with some noted alumni from the UW system including writers , professors , political thinkers and business leaders . <p> One of those panelists was Robin Vos . He is the speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly , and he 's well known for his conservative ideas , including those on education . And Speaker Vos had this to say about the necessity of getting a four-year college degree . <p> ROBIN VOS : I think all of us who 've gone to college and those of us who were in college realize that it 's more than just being in the classroom . It is about the experience of learning who you are , making sure that you understand your place in the world and that you find the appropriate way to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that should be the primary reason why folks go to college . It should be one of many , but I think that for students that I talked to for - unfortunately , many times that 's their primary reason to be here is to find out who they are and discover , perhaps , their heritage , perhaps , you know , some kind of background that they were not given an opportunity to learn when they were younger . <p> And they have every right to do that . But as somebody who has to be a good steward of the taxpayers , I mean , we have looked at things in the UW system . Number one - on most of the college campuses in our UW system - most college professors are full-time and most of those professors do teach 12 credits . But at UW , Madison , the number is significantly less . That 's something I think we really need to think about . As taxpayers look for an investment , how are we getting the best bang for our buck ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to encourage , but I also think that in society , if you look at the numbers just on the basic facts of today , about one-third of the new jobs that are going to be created between now and the year 2020 require a college degree . <p> About 30 percent requires some kind of additional training be out of high school and about a third require only a high school degree . So for us to create the stigma which society has really been doing that if you do n't go to college and get a four-year degree , you are somehow less of a person , you are somehow not as articulate or able to contribute to society , well in our state , we have huge needs that are in all kinds of genre , not just in a four-year institution . <p> Now , we will obviously need more people to graduate from college and help to succeed , but we need more plumbers . We need more electricians . We need people who are going to do all of the jobs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to increase the value of every profession in our society and not do it by just saying everybody needs to go to UW , Madison . <p> SINGH : That was Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos onstage with Michel Martin and several other panelists earlier this week in Madison , Wisc .

@@37206426 @6206426/ <p> On Thursday , a nationwide campaign called A Day Without Immigrants encouraged immigrant employees to stay home from work or to close their businesses for the day to make the contributions of immigrants more visible by their absence . Nowhere did this message come across more clearly than in the restaurant world . In cities across the country , restaurants either closed or operated with minimal staff . <p> But in an essay for NPR 's The Salt blog , restaurant owner Diep Tran offered another side to this story . She wrote about how immigrants are part of a food service economy that keeps prices low for customers but keeps employees in a state of perpetual poverty . And she wants diners to think about how their addiction to cheap eats affects the people who make and serve that food . <p> Diep Tran is with us now from KPCC in Pasadena , Calif . Thanks so much for speaking with us . <p> DIEP TRAN , BYLINE : Thanks so much for having me on . <p> MARTIN : Now , you specifically call out those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local papers and , you know , magazines and on websites like Eater . So what 's wrong with these lists ? <p> TRAN : The harm I see in these lists is that they perpetuate a consumer demand for cheap food , which in turn suppresses wages of immigrant workers in the restaurant industry . And I think what 's most insidious about these cheap eats is that they 're kind of marketed as a celebration of immigrant food . <p> MARTIN : You grew up around restaurants . You said you spent your childhood in relatives ' restaurants . You say in the piece , like , ( reading ) I watched my aunts and uncles work 16-hour days only to charge cut-rate prices for their food . And I also witnessed the grueling hours that their employees put in , also at cut-rate wages . It 's a cruel reality that immigrant enterprise is powered by the cheap labor of fellow immigrants . <p> But you also point out that this is a way that a lot of people can get a foothold who do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , right ? <p> TRAN : What ends up happening is that immigrants exploit themselves , exploit their children . Like , I was 10 years old when my relatives ' first restaurant opened , and we just helped in every single way . And I do n't want to demonize immigrant restaurants . I mean , they are just trying to make it , right ? But it 's the consumer demand for cheap food that drives the cheap prices . <p> MARTIN : But why is n't that a choice that you can make and then customers can eat or not eat there ? I mean , it does seem as though you 're putting it on consumers to voluntarily stop taking advantage of low prices . Why should they ? <p> TRAN : I think that restaurants charge a price that they think the market will bear . So when they 're hearing complaints from customers like this is too expensive for Vietnamese food , this is too expensive for a bowl of pho , they take that in . And it creates pressure for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in and eats my $10 pho and they complain about how expensive it is , I take it as a win . Like good , so I 'm doing a service so that it helps recalibrate - like , this is what a bowl of pho should cost if you care about workers . <p> MARTIN : You know , the argument is that people who offer lower prices is to the benefit of people who make lower wages because the people with more money can shop wherever . What do you say to that ? <p> TRAN : I actually do n't know what to say to that , I have to say , because if workers got paid more , they could afford more . <p> MARTIN : You suggest that these lists , instead of being called cheap eats , they would be called affordable eats . Why is that better ? <p> TRAN : I think cheap has a value . You know , it 's like the race to the bottom . And because that 's only the time in publications where you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Hey there , Geoff . <p> GEOFF BENNETT , BYLINE : Hey , Kelly . <p> MCEVERS : What are Democrats doing exactly ? <p> BENNETT : Well , they 're using parliamentary maneuvers to slow down the business of the Senate , and I 'm told Democrats are planning to hold the Senate floor until at least midnight by delivering a series of floor speeches .

And since Democrats are the minority party , they do n't have the power to stop Republicans altogether . But they can be disruptive . <p> And I think what this is , Kelly , is Democrats responding to the pressure they 're getting from progressive activists who frankly wanted them to be more aggressive all along and that they 've worried that while Republicans have been moving forward with their health care bill , everyone 's attention has been focused elsewhere , namely the Russia investigations .

And the majority leader - the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , makes the point that Congress has spent the last seven years learning about the Affordable Care Act and coming up with solutions . So he says there should n't be any surprises . <p> But you know , even as we speak , there are a number of Republican senators who 've seen nothing more than an outline or a PowerPoint summary of the legislation .

He said the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , knows people ca n't attack what they ca n't see , and drafting the Senate health care bill behind closed doors is the most expedient way for Republicans to arrive at the minimum votes they need to pass it . And so the secrecy gives Republican senators cover to hash out their significant and serious differences on this bill , a bill , by the way - at least the House version - which is not at all popular . <p> MCEVERS : And McConnell says he wants a vote on this bill before the July 4 congressional recess .

And in order to move on to tax overhaul or drafting a budget for the next fiscal year , they 've got to clear this first . And so the rules are crystal clear on that .

This year , the ceremony was scaled back , with the queen arriving by car rather than carriage and not wearing the crown or robes of state . <p> Protesters in London on Wednesday call for justice for the victims of the Grenfell Tower blaze . They joined other demonstrators in what they called a " day of rage " to protest perceived government inaction and neglect . <p> Carl Court / Getty Images <p> Originally published on June 21 , 2017 4:17 pm <p> When Elizabeth II rolled up to the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday , she did so without many of the trappings that typically attend the Queen 's Speech . Declining her traditional horse-drawn carriage , keeping the imperial crown beside her rather than atop her head and swapping the royal robes for a blue dress , the queen pointedly toned down the pomp this year . <p> The circumstance , however " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary session " remained as crucial and revealing as ever . In a U.K. roiled by surprising election results , terrorist attacks and the fallout from a deadly tower blaze , the Queen 's Speech offered a concrete road map of the next two years under diminished Conservative leadership . <p> And that road map includes a whole lot of Brexit . <p> Of the 27 proposed bills put forth in the speech , nearly a third pertain to the U.K. 's departure from the European Union . That includes a measure to transpose current EU laws into British laws , so as not to lose them when the country leaves the international organization , as well as bills that give the U.K. autonomy in crafting new policies in immigration , trade and agriculture . <p> " My Government will seek to maintain a deep and special partnership with European allies and to forge new trading relationships across the globe , " the queen said in prepared remarks . <p> For now , details on how exactly the British government will do so remain sparse , but the speech does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU . <p> In other respects , her speech " which is shaped by the governing party 's priorities " was notable for what it left out entirely . Gone was any mention of a few controversial points in the manifesto released by Conservatives before their anemic showing at the polls earlier this month " pledges such as an expansion of grammar schools and a re-examination of a ban on fox hunting . <p> Another detail earned notice for its absence : In a speech that traditionally notes important state visits " this time around , it was an upcoming visit from the king and queen of Spain " there was no mention of President Trump . Upon her own visit to the White House in January , Prime Minster Theresa May had agreed with Trump that he would pay a visit to the U.K. " later this year , " though that visit has received its fair share of protest among Brits . <p> Still , one outstanding issue did receive attention in the Palace of Westminster : Grenfell Tower . The high-rise complex suffered a deadly blaze last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were stripped of their homes . <p> As protesters marched on the prime minister 's residence in what they called a " day of rage " " a demonstration against perceived malfeasance and government inaction " the queen announced a Conservative plan to launch a " full public inquiry into the tragic fire " in order to " ascertain the causes , and ensure that the appropriate lessons are learnt . " <p> In a speech following the queen 's , May apologized for how her government handled the aftermath of the tragedy . <p> " That was a failure of the state , local , and national , to help people when they needed it most , " she said , according to The Guardian . " As prime minister I apologise for that failure , and as prime minister I 've taken responsibility for doing what we can to put things right .

It was widely seen as an early indicator of the party 's chances to gain control of the House of Representatives in 2018 . We 're going to talk about what the results might mean and what they might not mean with NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro . Hey there . <p> DOMENICO MONTANARO , BYLINE : Hi , Kelly . <p> MCEVERS : So this race , of course , got tons of attention nationally . More money was spent on this election than any other for Congress ever . Republicans are relieved with their win . For Democrats it seems like there 's been a lot of finger pointing today . <p> MONTANARO : Undoubtedly . I mean , it 's best summed up by two responses from two different wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have Jim Dean , who runs the progressive activist group Democracy for America . He said defeating Republicans requires running on a bold , progressive vision rather than what he says are establishment Democrats and what they - their sort of playbook has been and what they 've done before . <p> On the other hand , you have this congressman , Seth Moulton , from Massachusetts who backed a challenger to Nancy Pelosi when she was up for House minority leader again . And Pelosi factored heavily into this race . Republicans ran ad after ad after ad using Pelosi 's image , trying to tie Ossoff to her and make him a Pelosi puppet . And Moulton says that the result really should be , quote , " a wakeup call " for Democrats and that they need to focus on the future , have a , quote , " bigger tent " and stop rehashing the 2016 presidential campaign . <p> MCEVERS : Let 's talk about President Trump a little bit . His approval rating is pretty low . Did that affect how Republican Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . I mean , you know , part of what happened here , you know , is that Karen Handel really tried to walk the line when it came to Donald Trump . She did n't want to have to embrace Donald Trump . She did n't talk about him very much during the campaign . But at the same time , she understood he 's the president . <p> She came out the day after the first round of voting and said , look , he 's the leader of our party . And he 's welcome to come to Georgia 6 to campaign for me if that 's what he wants to do . So it may be a roadmap for Republicans in the future as they have to deal with a president who might not have such great approval ratings . <p> MCEVERS : President Trump on Twitter then called for Democrats to stop their obstruction and work with Republicans . Does this win help that agenda along ? <p> MONTANARO : In the short run , yes . I mean , Republicans really feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen Handel had lost , the Democrats were - and Democrats were able to pick up what has really been a reliable Republican seat , there might have been some second thoughts in the Senate about that health care bill , for example , that 's likely to drop any day now . It 's been written in private . And I had one former top aide say that he thought it was possible the Senate would have shelved the bill and the House come up with something driven by Republican moderates but not now . Now Republicans are full steam ahead . <p> MCEVERS : Wow . I mean , it sounds like this race was pretty important . But what does that - what does it mean for the midterms , for next year ? Does this mean that Democrats will not be able to take back the House - the million-dollar question . <p> MONTANARO : I know . And it - you know , I never like to overinterpret special elections because that can be a real problem . You know , it 's always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House because of how the districts have been drawn . <p> Just to give you an example of this and to tell you how much things have changed since redistricting after the last census , in 2006 , the last time Democrats won the House , almost 30 percent of the House was seen as potentially competitive . Now that number is below 10 percent - 10 percent . That means fewer than 40 seats or so , you know , or maybe , you know , less than that . Democrats need to pick up 24 seats overall . <p> So it 's possible . It 's possible Democrats could take back the House . But this was the type of seat Democrats needed to win and just were n't able to do it . You know , this was educated , suburban , moderate Republicans . They lost them . And their margin for error next year was always narrow , and now it just got narrower . <p> MCEVERS : Does that mean they just do n't have a winning strategy yet ? <p> MONTANARO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that appeals to red state voters in the South , in these red state districts or , frankly , to young voters . And you 're seeing that Obama coalition that had been glued together really kind of crumble , fall apart , and Democrats needing to piece it back together and still have n't figured out how .

It 's the taste of the Festa della Donna , an Italian holiday when women of all ages leave the menfolk behind to celebrate each other . <p> Today , for American women who are participating in A Day Without A Woman protest , the idea of taking a day off to celebrate their womanhood may be a new experience , despite the fact that International Women 's Day has been observed worldwide for over a century .

Women in other Communist societies around the world observed it as a non-working holiday for decades before Soviet women finally got the day off starting in 1965 . <p> The Italian holiday became more popular in 1946 , on the first March 8th following the end of World War II , when Italian feminists chose the mimosa flower as a symbol of sensitivity , strength and sensibility .

Of the current heroes of the sport , the 29-year-old Spaniard K+lian Jornet is absolutely superhuman . Some consider him to be the greatest mountain runner and alpine climber ever .

What kinds of trends have you seen ? <p> Some of the more interesting trends that we 've seen have been increases in species that we used to think of as southern species . Most people know cardinals , northern cardinals . They 're beautiful red birds . They never used to be in New Hampshire . And in fact , New Hampshire Audubon started a really early survey in 1967 for northern cardinals , tufted titmice , and northern mockingbirds .

Shaw plays someone nervous to go to a new school . <p> SHAW : I think it 's going to be scary . <p> UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #6 : Take deep breaths and you 'll not be scared . <p> BALONON-ROSEN : The idea is pretty straightforward - get children to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be better at doing it when they need to because they can draw on improv . <p> JIM ANSALDO : It 's being recognized as kind of a technology for human connection and communication . <p> BALONON-ROSEN : An hour and a half down the road , Jim Ansaldo is a disability education research scholar at Indiana University . He runs an improv summer camp for teens with autism and says programs are rare but growing . <p> ANSALDO : What improv really does is create a safe and fun and authentic environment in which to practice , where mistakes really do n't matter . <p> BALONON-ROSEN : Janna Graf , the mom of Shaw from earlier , says the change is real . She saw that when the 8-year-old , who she says can ramble , introduced himself at a church group . <p> JANNA GRAF : When he learned about how to stop and pause and take a moment , he said , my name 's Shaw , I 'm 8 years old , and he actually took his hands and waved it to the next person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ? <p> GRAF : Wonderful because now he 's learning how to wait . <p> BALONON-ROSEN : And it 's this kind of feedback that the researchers are using to see how improv classes transfer to real social skills .

He 's shown here in 1956 with his wife , Ruth , and two of their children . <p> Associated Press <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> A young woman meets a prince and falls in love . That sounds like the start of an old fashioned fairy tale , but in the movie A United Kingdom it 's the start of a diplomatic firestorm . The film tells the story of Ruth Williams and Seretse Khama , who married in 1948 . Williams was a typist in London ; Khama was heir to the throne of Bechuanaland , or modern-day Botswana . <p> Their marriage angered nearby countries that were part of the British empire , including South Africa , which had just banned mixed marriage and was establishing apartheid .

And , yes , I will marry you ( crying ) . <p> CORNISH : " A United Kingdom " tells the story of Ruth Williams and Seretse Khama beginning in the late 1940s . Williams is a London typist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Botswana . Now , their marriage angered nearby countries that were part of the British Empire , including South Africa . David Oyelowo , best known for playing another freedom fighter , Dr. Martin Luther King in 2014 's " Selma , " sat down with us to talk about playing Khama and how a marriage could upset the British Empire . <p> DAVID OYELOWO : They fell in love with each other 's soul . They fell in love with each other 's intellect . They fell in with each other 's love of jazz . And it was almost as if once they had fallen in love and were re-emerging from that haze , that suddenly the reality made itself known in the shape not only of familial opposition . <p> But governmentally , Bechuanaland , as Botswana was called back then , was a protectorate of the United Kingdom . And so , therefore , Great Britain had a say in what was happening in Bechuanaland . But South Africa was in the midst of instituting apartheid , and South Africa had a lot of leverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORNISH : Right , in this moment , they are literally codifying this way of life . And so right over the border , they ca n't have a white African Queen . <p> OYELOWO : Absolutely not . And that was the point . It was how high-profile of a marriage it was going to be . But putting that aside for one second , I mean , you know , let 's pay a moment 's thought for the people of Bechuanaland who had been subjected to apartheid-like behavior in their country not least because South Africa was over the border . And here was their prince who had been sent away to be educated coming back with a white person who in people in Bechuanaland 's mind was synonymous with intolerance and prejudice . And now you 're proposing that this person 's going to be our queen . <p> So you know , some of the opposition was very understandable .

That is where we should be focusing our minds , not on the wife I have chosen who means you no harm , whose only apparent crime has been to fall in love with me and mine to fall in love with her . <p> CORNISH : This scene also reminds me of scenes from the movie " Selma " where you played Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . I 've read that you stayed in character during that . You did a lot of research for that film in embodying that person .

And , you know , that 's a real point of overlap that I could feel in my body playing both characters . <p> CORNISH : You know , your portrayal of King back in 2014 was a performance that people thought should have been recognized by the Academy Awards . And that year , of course , like , no people of color ( laughter ) were recognize , really , for very much by the Academy .

And the big shift I have seen is not necessarily that infrastructurally things have changed enough to - for us to really pat ourselves on the back about change , but I feel like there is a holding to account of my industry and the captains of my industry in a way that there was n't before .

Yeah ... <p> CORNISH : Aw . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> OYELOWO : You know , as much as I love doing them and as much as I love playing those kind of roles , I ... <p> CORNISH : You 're , like , giving them to your kids at this point , right ? <p> OYELOWO : ( Laughter ) . <p> CORNISH : You 're just like , go to bed - yeah . <p> OYELOWO : ( Laughter ) Exactly , exactly .

@@37206466 @6206466/ <p> Republican candidate Karen Handel greets people during a campaign stop as she runs for Georgia 's 6th Congressional District on June 19 , 2017 in Alpharetta , Georgia . <p> Joe Raedle / Getty Images <p> Originally published on June 20 , 2017 3:09 pm <p> The long-awaited special election in Georgia is finally happening . <p> On Tuesday , people will head to the polls to cast their votes for either Democrat Jon Ossoff or Republican Karen Handel in the sixth congressional district special election in the Atlanta suburbs to replace Republican Tom Price . Price left his seat to become President Trump 's health and human services secretary . <p> That " long-awaited , " though , has been pretty long . As FiveThirtyEight 's Nate Silver pointed out recently , between the runoff for Tuesday 's race and the race itself , the U.K. has already gone through an entire election process . <p> " The UK *literally initiated and completed an entire parliamentary election* in the time in between the GA-6 primary and runoff , " he wrote . <p> Only 51 days passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections ( April 18 ) to Election Day ( June 8 ) . Meanwhile , April 18 was the day of Georgia 's runoff , and June 20 will be the general election for that House seat . <p> And that 's just counting from the runoff . Georgia Gov . Nathan Deal declared the election date on Feb. 10 ( 130 days before the general election ) , when Price was confirmed as HHS secretary . <p> That 's not even the longest special election campaign happening this year . On Dec. 12 ( Dec. 12 ! ) , Alabama will elect someone to fill the Senate seat Jeff Sessions vacated when he became Attorney General . The governor called that election on April 18 , 238 days before the vote will take place . <p> So here 's how those long stretches of campaigning stack up to the lengths of elections in a few other countries , as well as the 2016 presidential election : <p> And this even undershoots , to a degree , the length of the campaigns in those U.S. special elections , because candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate entered the Georgia special election on Nov. 30 , 2016 ( 202 days before Tuesday 's vote ) . <p> Likewise , the first candidate in the Alabama Senate race , state Attorney General Luther Strange , declared he would run back in December " 385 full days before the election . ( That election took some time to be announced , however , as the last governor , Robert Bentley , appointed Strange to replace Sessions instead of calling for an election , as the law requires . ) <p> Counted from when the first person declared he was running , and this year 's Alabama Senate race is even longer than the span between last year 's Iowa caucuses and Election Day 2016 . Here 's how those numbers stack up : <p> Of course , this kind of comparison obscures some important details about foreign countries ' elections . For one , even with restrictions on campaign lengths in place , candidates in some foreign nations can start making noise about running well before " campaigning " officially begins . A " faux-campaign " had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as London 's Guardian reported last year . <p> And while Mexico imposes a 90-day campaign period " that marks when candidates can spend their public campaign funds and thereby start campaigning in earnest " candidates can still declare they 're interested in running well ahead of time . Already in June 2015 , the first candidate for that country 's 2018 presidential election declared she was in . <p> So while they may not be able to fill the airwaves with ads , they can still make their way into news coverage for quite a while before the vote happens . ( Of course , that happens here , too , before the first candidate declares . ) <p> In addition , parliamentary systems are by nature going to have starkly different elections than the U.S. , as Bill Scher pointed out at RealClearPolitics last year . <p> " ... It 's completely disingenuous to compare America 's presidential election season to states with parliamentary systems . The political parties in those countries typically select their leaders years before elections are called " and not in small-d democratic primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to decide on their choices . The party leaders then square off inside their respective parliaments day after day . " <p> And one final addendum : shorter does n't necessarily mean better . In Japan , tight rules like limiting campaigning to 12 days keeps opposition parties out of power , the Sunlight Foundation argued in 2014 . <p> So there 's some reason not to want the shortest campaign period possible . <p> Still , after months of phone calls and door knocking , the residents of Georgia 's sixth district may want more of a happy medium .

Now to Donald Trump 's first full day as president . He attended an interfaith prayer service at the National Cathedral . That 's something of a tradition for newly sworn in presidents . What Donald Trump did next is not so traditional . He visited CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . That 's being seen as an olive branch to the U.S. intelligence community because in the past , President Trump has criticized them . <p> But Trump 's message was eclipsed by his campaign-style rhetoric and exaggerations about the crowd at yesterday 's inauguration . NPR 's Scott Horsley joins us now to tell us more . Scott , thank you for joining us . Scott , are you with us ? Scott Horsley ? <p> SCOTT HORSLEY , BYLINE : Yes . Hi , Michel .

The president insists he is not feuding with the intelligence community , but is he ? <p> HORSLEY : Well , he certainly was , and this dates back to at least October when the director of national intelligence along with the secretary of Homeland Security went public with their findings that the highest levels of the Russian government were trying to interfere with the U.S. election . Trump disputed that argument and his protest got even louder after the election when the CIA and others said publicly Russia was n't just trying to muddy the waters . It was actively trying to help Trump . <p> Now , the new president and his team repeatedly challenged that finding as an attempt to de-legitimize his election . There was also fallout with the dossier of unsubstantiated claims about Trump , which both he and former President Obama were briefed on and which Trump then suggested had been leaked to the media by the intelligence community .

They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth . <p> MARTIN : OK . So the president - and I should also mention the vice president - made this trip out to Langley . They met with hundreds of CIA employees , sounds like they were warmly greeted . But could you tell us a little bit more about the setting ? <p> HORSLEY : Yeah . Vice President Pence and the president spoke to CIA employees while they were standing in front of a memorial wall that honors CIA agents who 've given their lives in the line of duty . And Pence took the opportunity to stress that he and Trump really recognize the sacrifices that the men and women of the intelligence community make for their country . Now , Trump gave a nod to that , and he spoke briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompeo , who could be confirmed on Monday . <p> But then , as he so often does , Trump turned the conversation around to his own successful presidential campaign . He said probably everybody in this room voted for me , and then he took another dig at the news media saying reporters had been understating the size of the crowd that watched his inauguration yesterday . 190095 @qwx390095 <p> TRUMP : But we had a massive field of people . You saw that - packed . I get up this morning . I turn on one of the networks , and they show an empty field . I said , wait a minute . I made a speech . I looked out . The field was - it looked like a million , a million and a half people . <p> MARTIN : Now , Scott , it is always difficult and politically fraught to estimate crowd sizes for large , public events .

And it appears to be well below the million to million and a half people that Donald Trump himself was citing here . <p> And I point this out because this is something Trump did throughout the campaign - exaggerating the size of his rally crowds which were large crowds anyway .

The benefit to the anemone is less clear " the crab controls how much food its sea anemones get , maintaining them as small " bonsai " versions . <p> " For the crab , we can say with almost certainty that the crab is dependent on the anemone , " explains lead author Yisrael Schnytzer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hole , Mass .

He joined NHPR 's Morning Edition . <p> This is the second year the city has run this program , and it 's expanding this summer with up to 120 students enrolled , up from 51 last year . How big of a need is there in Manchester for something like this ? <p> There 's a large need everywhere for something like this . It 's not just Manchester or relegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that students lose a certain amount of progress over the course of any break , and certainly the two-month summer break is the longest one students deal with . In Manchester , we have a greater proportion of kids who do not have the options available to them to continue their summer learning or the ability to maintain their learning through different experiences , so this becomes very important in our community for kids . <p> Can you tell me about the academy ? What will students be doing over those six weeks ? <p> The program is run by the YMCA and the Boys &amp; Girls Club here in Manchester . The school district is partnering with them to host as a location as the program grew this year . So the kudos and the congratulations really do need to go to the teen center staff at the Y and the staff at the Boys &amp; Girls Club for getting this program off the ground . We 're just happy to be a partner with them and to be able to help expand that program . <p> Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a combination of academics and camp activities . So there 's an hour and a half each day of literacy instruction and an hour and a half a day of math instruction . The remainder of the day is made up of summer camp and recreational activities , which are also something many of our students do n't have access to in the normal process of their lives . The Friday part of the program is a field trip to different venues and areas around the state and the region . That is for the students who have made their progress during the week . So again , these are experiences many of our students would not have the ability to access . <p> Do you specifically target low-income students to take part ? <p> We do not specifically target low-income students . It happens that Manchester has an identifiable population of low-income students , but we target students who would benefit from summer engagement or families who wish their kids to be engaged in the summer . There 's no academic threshold for entry , although schools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cohort . <p> What kind of results did you see for students who took part last summer ? <p> Last summer , over the six weeks students were making two to three months of gains in their learning . So they were not just maintaining their progress from the school year , they were actually beginning to close gaps if they exist and progress beyond their status when they entered the program . <p> Are there other ways the school tries to keep students engaged over the summer break ? <p> There are . This year in Manchester , the district undertook a Booked For Summer ' program , where at all three levels students were engaged with opportunities and activities , things they could do here in the city and the region , all tied into literacy and the importance of reading as a pastime and activity . <p> More districts seem to be looking at year-round options , to break up that long summer break .

That includes enforcing the individual mandate , which penalizes people who do n't buy insurance , and promising to make cost-sharing payments required under the ACA that reimburse insurers for giving extra discounts to the lowest-income customers . <p> If they do n't , " it would kill the market overnight . " Schlosser said . <p> " That would be terrible for society , it would be terrible for the whole health care system , and everybody would be worse off , " he said . <p> I pointed out to Schlosser that his company has a direct line to the White House .

His company sells ACA health plans in the Philadelphia area and southern New Jersey . <p> " I 'm here in DC because of what 's happening in health care , " he said . But acknowledged he does n't know what 's in the Senate bill , even though the Blue plans he represents as chairman of the association insure one-third of all Americans . <p> Hilferty said the ACA has problems , but it did manage to bring insurance coverage to about 20 million people who did n't have it before .

His company has filed to sell ACA plans in the Philadelphia area . But if the Trump administration does n't commit to making cost-sharing payments or to enforcing the individual mandate that requires people to have insurance , his rates could go up a lot . <p> Either way , both companies are operating as if the ACA markets will be alive and functioning in 2018 . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion will prevail in DC , " Schlosser said .

@@37206487 @6206487/ <p> When Ali Andrew Li was born on Jan. 7 , he was gently placed on his mother 's chest , where doctors cleaned and examined him and covered him with a warm blanket . <p> " I just loved it , " his mother , Salma Shabaik , a family physician who lives in Los Angeles , says . " It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him , touch him , kiss him . " <p> That was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago ; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined . And unlike Elias , who cried a lot after delivery , Shabaik says Ali stopped crying " within seconds " after being placed on her chest . <p> Kangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies , and it 's gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well . It is as it sounds : Like a kangaroo 's pouch , mothers hold their naked newborns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born , the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns . The baby gets to know their mother immediately , says Dr. Larry Gray , behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children 's Hospital , University of Chicago Medicine . " The baby gets landed in a trusting environment , " he says , reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be " soft , comfortable and warm . " <p> The benefits are many , according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee , an ob-gyn at UCLA . Not only is the baby happier , she says , but his or her vitals are more stable . Body temperature , heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly . The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother , which can protect against allergies and infection in the future . Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily , Lee says , and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer less pain . Almost 20 years ago , Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood , a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders . He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care , there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain , compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets , " sort of alone . " <p> One of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s . There , hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live . But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close , skin to skin , not only survived but thrived . <p> This was a " serendipitous magical finding , " says Gray , suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a " natural incubator . " <p> Gray also points to the work of Myron Hofer , a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pass between mother and baby . It 's not just that mother and baby are together , Gray says , but also that the mother is in some way " programming the baby , the breathing , temperature and heart rate . " <p> That " magic " can also happen between baby and father , too , says Gray , if there 's skin-to-skin contact . And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated , Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin . Even a little bit of kangaroo contact , he says , can be beneficial . 190096 @qwx390096 <p> RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : <p> Kangaroo mother care , it 's a technique for mothers to bond with their newborns immediately after delivery . And the name kind of gives away what this is all about . Naked newborns are placed on their mother 's bare chest , a little like a baby kangaroo in its mother pouch . <p> STEVE INSKEEP , HOST : <p> Aw , that sounds kind of sweet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as a new mom ? <p> MARTIN : I did . <p> INSKEEP : Of course . <p> MARTIN : In fact , I should note though , my husband did it , too . <p> INSKEEP : Oh , very nice - and people do encourage fathers to kind of bond with the child that way . This is common practice , especially for children who were born prematurely . And it 's growing popular for healthy full-term babies , too . Here 's NPR 's Patti Neighmond . <p> SHABAIK : Hello ? I think you want to tell us that you just want to sleep ( laughter ) . <p> NEIGHMOND : Ali was born just two weeks ago - 8 pounds , 3 ounces , 20 inches long - with a full head of shiny black hair . He was delivered at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , where kangaroo mother care is routinely practiced . <p> SHABAIK : After he delivered . Immediately after , he was on my chest . Cleaning him off , like , rubbing him , all that happening while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was a pediatrician or a nurse practitioner , but whoever was examining the baby examined him also while he was on my chest - so listening with the stethoscope and looking at him and whatnot , everything happening while he was laying on my chest . <p> NEIGHMOND : Which was different than her firstborn son , who was whisked away to a warming crib and weighed , measured and examined there . He cried a lot , she says . But within seconds of being placed on her chest , Ali stopped crying . <p> SHABAIK : I loved it . It was really nice to kind of have baby right there with you , rather than watching , trying to see what they 're doing , you know , from the bed . When he 's right there and I could feel him and touch him and kiss him and all of that - so I think it just added more depth to the delivery . <p> LYDIA LEE : It improves body temperature , so the baby does n't cool off . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . They seem to cry less and not grimace as much . <p> NEIGHMOND : When babies receive kangaroo mother care , they 're better able to breast-feed . And mothers tend to breast-feed for a longer period of time . All good , says Lee , because breast-feeding is well known to keep babies healthy and avoid illness . <p> At UCLA and at hospitals nationwide , Lee says there 's another growing practice aimed at naturalizing the birth experience - delaying cutting the umbilical cord . After the baby is put on the mother 's chest , the cord is left attached for about one minute . <p> LEE : And that allows some of the blood from the placenta to continue going to the baby . And that increases the iron store in the baby . <p> NEIGHMOND : Allowing not only iron but also other nutrients to continue flowing from mother to baby even after delivery . Pediatrician and researcher Dr. Larry Gray with the Comer Children 's Hospital at University of Chicago Medicine did a study that shows kangaroo mother care also seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a heel prick to draw blood - a procedure to screen newborns for diseases that can be identified in the first day of life . Gray found babies cuddled with their mom in kangaroo care seemed to feel less pain . <p> LARRY GRAY : There was essentially no evidence of the rise in heartrate to suggest that the baby felt pain , compared to the babies who had been swaddled and had that blood procedure in their bassinets sort of alone . <p> NEIGHMOND : The first place to document how this technique works with premature babies was in Bogota , Colombia . In poor areas where there was no access to incubators and other high-tech equipment , preemies were often sent home with no expectation they would live . But doctors were surprised to see babies whose mothers carried them close , skin to skin , not only survived but thrived . Gray says one likely reason , so-called hidden regulators , which cement the attachment between mom and newborn . <p> GRAY : It 's not just that the mother and the baby are being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby - programming the baby 's breathing , programming the baby 's temperature , learning the baby 's cues . And so there 's some magic that happens . <p> NEIGHMOND : That magic can happen between a baby and a father too , he says , if there 's skin-to-skin contact . Now , if mothers or babies are sick and need to be isolated , Gray says just take any opportunity you can to hold your infant skin to skin .

I think it 's important to call them out and to - you know , to stick up to them , but just being insulting - that 's something completely different . <p> SHAPIRO : It sounds like the very same thing that , Alex , worries you is , Ryan , what appeals to you . <p> LEAVIS : I would say that , you know , you 're probably right about that . <p> MILLER : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEAVIS : That 's probably - sounds pretty spot-on .

Your lives are on the line . <p> LEAVIS : Well , even though - sorry , this is Ryan . But even though Donald Trump will become the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , it is not entirely on his shoulders .

I think Mattis is , you know , going to be a great - is a great pick for secretary of defense . And , you know , it 's not entirely on Donald Trump , but at the end of the day , he 's the commander-in-chief . He 's given the final say . <p> SHAPIRO : I think today in America , so many Trump voters are surrounded by only Trump voters and so many Clinton voters are surrounded by only Clinton voters ... <p> MILLER : Yeah . <p> SHAPIRO : ... And are in these sort of Facebook bubbles and where we live determines who we vote for . You guys are friends in a fraternity together .

We 're friends during the election . We 're going to be friends after the election . Just because someone has a different opinion than you does n't mean they 're an awful person , does n't mean they 're a bad guy . <p> LEAVIS : Tough love . But , no , I definitely - I think that if a lot of people sat down and actually had , you know , conversations with each other , I think that we 'd find that we can find common ground and we can work together to make a Donald Trump presidency , hopefully ... <p> SHAPIRO : I was sure you were going to say make America great again . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> MILLER : In a way . <p> LEAVIS : In a way - in a way .

@@37206501 @6206501/ <h> Forget Freud : Dreams Replay Our Everyday Lives <p> Thanks to Sigmund Freud , we all know what it means to dream about swords , sticks and umbrellas . Or maybe we do n't . <p> " For 100 years , we got stuck into that Freudian perspective on dreams , which turned out to be not scientifically very accurate , " says Robert Stickgold , a sleep researcher and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School . " So it 's only been in the last 15 to 20 years that we 've really started making progress . " <p> Today , most brain scientists reject Freud 's idea that dreams are highly symbolic representations of unconscious ( and usually sexual ) desire . That dream umbrella , they say , is probably just an umbrella . <p> But researchers are still trying to figure out what dreams do represent , and what their purpose is . <p> " There 's not really a solid theory about why dreaming is there , " says Benjamin Baird , a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Sleep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a big mystery . " <p> But it 's not surprising that we do dream , Baird says . One of the main functions of our brain is to constantly create a model of the world around us , a sort of virtual reality that helps us interact with our environment . <p> When we 're awake , that model is heavily influenced by what we are seeing and hearing and feeling . But during sleep , when there 's not much input from our senses , the brain 's model of the world is more likely to rely on internal information , like memories or expectations . <p> " So something like dreaming is to be expected , " Baird says . <p> And by studying people as they sleep , scientists have learned a lot about dreams . <p> Dreaming All Night Long <p> One observation from sleep labs is that we dream a lot , even though we rarely remember these dreams . <p> Medical textbooks often say that people average about five dreams each night . But sleep researchers say that 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is ever a time when we 're asleep that we do n't have some form of consciousness going on , " Stickgold says . <p> Some of the evidence for this comes from sleep studies showing many periods during the night when signals from the brain suggest a person is thinking . More evidence comes from sleep studies in which people are repeatedly awakened , which greatly increases the chance they will remember a dream or thought . <p> When a person is woken up , they report some sort of mental activity about 80 percent of the time , Stickgold says . He says many of these " mentation reports " are more fragmented and less likely to contain narrative elements than what most people consider a dream . <p> And scientists have revised an old assumption that dreams occur only during rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep . There 's growing evidence that dreams also can occur during non-REM sleep , though these dreams tend to be less vivid . <p> A Hot Zone For Dreams <p> Sleep studies also have led researchers to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams . <p> This region at the back of the brain becomes very active when people are dreaming , a team reported earlier this year in Nature Neuroscience . The team studied the electrical patterns in the brains of 32 people as they slept , and woke them up repeatedly to ask about dreams . <p> The researchers also found that brain activity could reveal some details of a dream , like whether it included a face or movement . These experiences activated the same brain circuits that become active when an awake person sees a face or experiences movement . <p> The finding supports other research finding that " we are using our brains the same when we 're dreaming as when we 're awake , " Stickgold says . <p> Dreams and Memory <p> Many researchers believe dreams have a close relationship to the way our brains process memories . <p> " When we sleep , the brain does a lot of work , taking what we 've learned , what we 've encoded as new memories in the last day , and trying to figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a way for the brain to " take new information , combine it with old information in these totally strange ways , and see if it can get any insights into the usefulness of that information , " he says . <p> This sort of thinking grew out of studies showing that REM sleep can help people remember something they 've learned . There is also evidence that during REM sleep , the brain relives certain recent experiences , burning them into long-term memory " a process known as memory consolidation . <p> But scientists are still debating whether dreaming is an essential part of this sort of memory processing , or just a novel byproduct of the brain 's nighttime activity . <p> Dreams And The Developing Brain <p> Even before birth , a baby 's brain begins experiencing intense periods of REM sleep , the sleep state usually associated with dreaming . <p> " REM sleep is clearly playing a developmental role because it is occurring in huge proportions just before and after birth , " Baird says . One hypothesis is that by dreaming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protoconsciousness that will help it become fully conscious later on . <p> But there 's no way of knowing whether a fetal brain is actually dreaming , or what it would dream about . And children do n't begin having dreams with story lines until about age 5 , when their waking brains have learned to tell stories . <p> Dreams We All Dream <p> A number of Freud 's observations about dreams are still relevant , even if his interpretations of them are less than scientific . <p> For example , he observed that certain dream elements are common , if not universal . Teeth , for example . <p> " A particularly remarkable dream symbol is that of having one 's teeth fall out , or having them pulled , " Freud wrote in A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis . He goes on to say that 's usually a symbol for castration " as a punishment for onanism . " The castration explanation may be off base , Baird says . But problems with teeth are , indeed , something many people report in their dreams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that got to do with anything ? " Baird suspects we share many dreams like this because we share the same nervous system design , and many of the same anxieties . <p> Lucid Dreaming And Consciousness <p> Dreams may be so hard to pin down scientifically because they are so closely related to consciousness , a concept that has bedeviled scientists and philosophers for centuries . <p> We all somehow know we are conscious . But it 's been difficult to define precisely what consciousness is , let alone determine how it is generated by the brain . <p> And dreams are " a nasty little side part of the problem of consciousness , " Stickgold says . When you are dreaming , " you are in an altered state of consciousness , " Stickgold says . " It 's just not the same exact kind of consciousness as we have when we 're awake . " <p> In some dreams , " consciousness " may be as simple as feeling an emotion or seeing a face . In others , though , it can involve complex narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's astounding , really , that completely on its own the brain is taking some random activation and structuring it into these fantastic narratives , " Baird says . <p> Both Baird and Stickgold think dreams may offer a way to study consciousness . One reason is that when someone begins dreaming , it 's possible to watch their brain enter a certain state of consciousness . That is allowing scientists to look at the brain circuits that are involved in producing this state . <p> And Baird is particularly interested in dreams known as lucid dreams . They are unusual because the dreamer is actually conscious that they are dreaming , Baird says . <p> He and other researchers say lucid dreaming may be a state in which the brain is simultaneously awake and dreaming . So it may be possible to have dreamers themselves ask what their dreams mean . <p> The dreams illustrated were compiled by researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz . Illustrations are by Jennifer Qian . Kerin Higa , Katie Park and Meredith Rizzo contributed to this report .

It was the second one , that Smith was then lying on the ground unarmed and wounded and defenseless when the officer fired the second shot . And Chisholm said the officer should have known that Smith was no longer a threat . <p> Now , the defense claimed - and it just put one witness on the stand .

" <p> But in response to a question from the committee 's ranking member , Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , Johnson said he was concerned he would be criticized " for perhaps taking sides " in an ongoing election if he publicly spoke out about the Russian meddling that he knew was going on . <p> One of the candidates , Johnson said , not naming but clearly referring to Donald Trump , " was predicting that the election was going to be rigged , " Johnson said , and so we were concerned that by making the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of the election process . " <p> Johnson said that on October 7 , he and then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement accusing the Russian government of interfering with the U.S. election process " a claim Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied . But that statement he said " did not get the attention it should have , " because of the release of the Access Hollywood tape that day " in which then-candidate Trump boasted of groping and kissing women . <p> In retrospect , Johnson said he wished " he had camped out with a sleeping bag " in front of the Democratic National Committee to get them to take seriously warnings that their email server had been hacked . <p> Johnson said he was disappointed the DNC would not accept Homeland Security 's help in finding its cyber-vulnerabilities . He said he had asked on a number of occasions if the DNC had taken up the Department of Homeland Security 's help . " I recall very clearly that I was not pleased we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have the authority to go into a private company with a warrant to fix its IT problems . <p> Johnson also testified he feared designating states ' election systems as " critical infrastructure " earlier than he did would have driven away states that were suspicious of federal involvement in their elections . He said he first raised the issue with states in a conference call in mid-August , after seeing " troubling reports " of scanning and probing activities around various state voter registration databases . Johnson said initial reaction from state officials to the designation " ranged from neutral to negative . " It was n't until after the election , that Johnson formally made the designation . <p> But Johnson told lawmakers that there was no evidence that votes were altered as the result of Russian efforts to breach state election systems . <p> " Based on everything I know , that is correct , " Johnson told Rep. Mike Conaway , R-Texas , " I know of no evidence that , through cyber-intrusions , votes were altered or suppressed in some way .

Now , the key question for the President and Congress is : What are we going to do to protect the American people and their democracy from this kind of thing in the future ? " <p> While Johnson testified on the House side , the Senate Intelligence Committee held its own hearing focused on state election systems . Senators heard from cybersecurity experts from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security as well as from representatives of state election systems and state secretaries of state across the country . <p> In the Senate hearing , Department of Homeland Security and FBI witnesses told lawmakers they expect the Russian cyber-threat against the U.S. to " evolve " " and that governments across the country must try to keep up as well . <p> " I believe the Russians absolutely will continue to try to conduct influence operations in the U.S. , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the FBI 's Counterintelligence Division . <p> Democrats on the Senate panel , however , are frustrated by DHS Secretary John Kelly 's unwillingness to disclose more detail about the states that were targeted or compromised last year .

Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , also said he hoped the Intelligence Committee could reveal as much as possible because of how corrosive Russia 's influence efforts have already proven . <p> " I think you could argue they 've achieved quite a bit because if you look at the amount of time we 've spent in this country on what happened and if you look at the political fissures that formed . " <p> Rubio told a story about seeing a fake story that said President Obama had " banned " the Pledge of Allegiance " and getting text messages asking him about it . <p> " I knew it was n't true , " he said , " but people thought it was . " <p> The testimony was grim from the Senate Intelligence Committee 's second panel , which included state elections officials and a computer science expert who described the vulnerability from which he said electronic voting systems suffer . <p> Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , described the work he and colleagues had done exploring state computer systems with a view toward helping improve their security . <p> " My conclusion from that work is that our highly computerized election infrastructure is vulnerable to sabotage , and even to cyberattacks that could change votes , " he warned . " These realities risk making our election results more difficult for the American people to trust . I know America 's voting machines are vulnerable because my colleagues and I have hacked them . " <p> Federal and state officials insist that no votes were changed by Russian cyberattacks in 2016 , but Halderman said that would remain a real possibility unless the nation took a series of steps to update its security . <p> States must replace what he called " obsolete " paperless machines with optical-scan machines that count paper ballots , Halderman said . States must audit election results by examining paper ballots to " provide high assurance " that the election results were correct . And state officials must apply tougher cybersecurity safeguards to voting equipment and elections management . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but state officials complained to the Senate Intelligence Committee that they 're waiting to see any benefit from the designation by DHS of elections systems as " critical infrastructure .

" he told the crowd gathered in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , on Wednesday night . It was classic campaign Trump throughout his hour-plus stemwinder , decrying the " phony witch hunts going against me , " hitting the " dishonest media , " doubling down on his pledge to build a border wall and reliving his November victory . <p> At the outset , Trump boasted about how Republicans had been counted out in the Tuesday contest in Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his agenda . But in the end , GOP nominee Karen Handel ended up topping Democrat Jon Ossoff , and in South Carolina , Republican Ralph Norman rolled to a closer-than-expected finish in another special election . <p> " The truth is people love us , all of us . They love us . Democrats have n't figured it out yet , " Trump said . <p> It was the president 's fifth campaign rally since he was inaugurated in January . The frequent returns to the campaign trail are a huge deviation from past presidents , but they give Trump a chance to recharge and connect with his supporters . All of his rallies have been sponsored by his re-election committee . <p> Trump 's speech began remarkably on-message and upbeat , without some of the dark imagery painting a sullen country he is known to use . <p> " History is written by the dreamers , not the doubters , " he told the crowd , urging them to " set aside the cynics and the critics . " Their presence there tonight , Trump said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " <p> " All you want is a government that shows you the same respect and loyalty in return , " the president said . " You believe that America must protect and defend its own citizens . With that conviction , deep in your hearts , you showed up on Election Day and voted to put America first . " <p> On the health care bill that Senate Republicans are set to unveil on Thursday , Trump said he hoped they " surprise you with a good plan , " but one with " heart . " And , he laughed , " add some money to it ! " <p> He began to acknowledge he would like Democratic support in the effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama 's signature achievement . " If we had even a little Democratic support , just a little , like a couple of votes , you 'd have everything , " Trump said . <p> But then he began bashing the opposing party , quipping that " I am making it a little bit hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from then on , it was freewheeling Trump as he jumped from topic to topic , strayed off message , made some head-scratching remarks and revisited some old campaign trail favorites . <p> In talking about his cadre of advisers , he boasted about their financial pedigrees " even though he had slammed Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail for being too close to those same interests . <p> " We have Gary Cohn , who is the president of Goldman Sachs . He 's the president of Goldman Sachs . He had to pay $200 million in taxes to take the job , right ? So , somebody said , ' Why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy ? ' I said , ' Because that 's the kind of thinking we want , ' " Trump said , adding that Cohn and other multimillionaires in his Cabinet had to " give up a lot " in taking administration jobs , going from " massive paydays to peanuts . " <p> " And I love all people , rich or poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular positions , I just do n't want a poor person , does that make sense ? " <p> He also slighted wind power as a reliable energy source " " I do n't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes " " even though Iowa is the highest producer of wind energy in the U.S. , accounting for almost a third of its energy production . <p> Trump also said he will soon propose a new immigration rule that anyone seeking to come to the U.S. has to be able to financially support themselves and not use welfare resources for five years . However , as The Hill noted , that law already exists . It was passed in 1996 under President Bill Clinton .

She said the tragedy should be a call for more civility in politics on both sides . <p> " We also need to lift up this nation so that we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements , " Handel said . " Because in these United States of America , no one " no one " should ever feel their life threatened over their political beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling short in a handful of other special elections " including another one on Tuesday in South Carolina 's 5th District that was much closer than expected . In that contest , Republican Ralph Norman beat Democrat Archie Parnell by just about 3 points to succeed Trump 's Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney . <p> That race received little national attention or money compared with the one in Georgia or other special elections . But the narrow win , compared with the 19 points Trump won the district by in November , is a major swing . Similarly , there was a 20-point swing in a Kansas special election and 15-point shift in Montana last month . <p> As anger with Trump rose across the country , Ossoff became a somewhat unlikely vehicle for the resistance to the president and the GOP agenda , attracting support from many people who said they were shell-shocked by Clinton 's loss in November and who wanted to engage in politics . The first-time candidate raised more than $23 million for his campaign , but most of that came from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Volunteers from across the country flocked to help him on the ground , too , and with that money , he was able to build an impressive ground game . <p> In the end , though , it was n't enough , and the longtime GOP lean of the district was too much for Ossoff to overcome . This is a seat Republicans have held for decades " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had represented areas in the current 6th District . <p> Still even though this seat has been in GOP hands for decades and Price routinely won re-election easily , this was n't Trump country in 2016 . The president only narrowly carried the district by just over 1 point ; in 2012 , GOP nominee Mitt Romney won it by 23 points . <p> It is the type of district Democrats have to do well in come 2018 to flip the 24 seats they need to win back the House . There are 23 districts currently held by Republicans that Clinton carried in November , and some of them share similar characteristics to Georgia 's 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While special elections are n't a perfect predictor of future success in regular elections , Handel 's win is still a disappointment for Democrats . However , as strategists point out , there are plenty of opportunities on the board for them in 2018 ; a president 's party typically loses seats in the first-term midterms . And it 's futile to project what the environment may look like 17 months from now . <p> " There are more than 70 districts more favorable to Democrats than this deep-red district , and Ossoff 's close margin demonstrates the potential for us to compete deep into the battlefield , " Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj+n , D-N.M. , said in a statement . " The strong headwinds facing Republicans , incredible grassroots enthusiasm behind Democrats , and a damaged and exposed House Republican Caucus all clarify that we have the momentum heading into 2018 .

But later spots focused on cutting government waste and working to attract more tech jobs to the area . Those are n't typically the top Democratic talking points , and often , he did n't even mention his party I 'd . <p> In his concession speech , Ossoff argued that the enthusiasm his campaign was able to generate was still a good sign for the party in a race that was n't expected to be close at the outset . <p> " We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight , we could fight , " Ossoff told a gathering of disappointed supporters . <p> The outside money in the race became one of the most potent attacks by Handel , who was previously the Fulton County Commission chairwoman , the most populous area of the district that ultimately delivered decisive margins to help her finish off Ossoff . Handel emphasized her experience and decades of public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't even live in the district . Ossoff grew up in the district but now lives just outside the border near Emory University , while his fiancee finishes medical school . <p> Handel also never fully embraced or distanced herself from Trump . The president held a fundraiser for her early on and sent out tweets on her behalf in the final days of the race , including on Tuesday night . But other surrogates like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Vice President Pence were the ones who provided on-the-ground support . She thanked the president in her victory remarks on Tuesday night , getting loud cheers from her supporters . <p> The argument made by even Trump allies , such as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue , the state 's former governor , was that even if you do n't like Trump , do n't hold that against Handel . <p> " Some Republicans may even be turned off by our president , " Perdue acknowledged at a rally Saturday . <p> And , he seemed to admit , a loss could have be damaging for the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national politics . And the world is looking ; the nation is looking . " <p> Ultimately , the win could be a good sign for the GOP going forward and may provide a boost for its efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , with Senate Republicans expected to unveil their health care bill on Thursday . Handel supported the GOP House version , the American Health Care Act , while Ossoff opposed it . But neither made it a major issue in the contest .

And sure , we 've seen amazing technical achievements and advances on television . But would n't it be funny to just draw a cartoon on top of a sitcom ? <p> That 's the conceit behind Fox 's Son Of Zorn , which you can basically think of as a family sitcom where the dad is He-Man . Everything in the show is live-action , except that the noncustodial parent of the sweet but sullen teenager is Zorn ( voiced by Jason Sudeikis ) , a shirtless cartoon hero who carries a sword and is n't afraid to use it . But that does n't mean he 's not a loving , if bumbling , dad . <p> That , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea : in most ways , it 's a pretty conventional show about a dad trying to connect with his adolescent son ( Johnny Pemberton ) in spite of the misgivings of his ex-wife Edie ( Cheryl Hines ) . It 's just that this dad happens to be a cartoon character accustomed to pillaging . In the pilot , how exactly Edie managed to conceive a child with a giant cartoon character is not explained . It just is . <p> In that way , Son Of Zorn resembles the way Fox 's comedy TheLast Man On Earth began . Starring Will Forte as the titular last man on Earth ( who turns out not to be , actually ) , that show has lasted a couple of seasons spinning out a world that it launched without explaining it all that much . We did n't know details about the virus that killed most of the world or much about the logistics of the death wave that spared Phil ( Forte ) and some others . But like cartoon Dad , the idea of an isolated Phil is established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about both of these concepts . Zorn , for instance , is n't an elegant animated character , unique and special . He 's a relic of what a lot of us recall as the lowbrow , workaday cartoons that used to pack Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons . Why a knockoff of He-Man ? Well , why not ? A huge shirtless dude trying to get a job interview is funny . A bumbling warrior giving his kid a fantasy creature as a gift and delivering it in the driveway of a suburban house is funny . Is it brilliant ? Naw . But this is what television is now ; it 's more specific attempts to throw a lot of things at the wall and hope the the very oddity of them sticks for just enough people . <p> Son Of Zorn was created by Reed Agnew and Eli Jorne , but it counts among its executive producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , who have credits from Clone High and Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs to The Lego Movie and , in fact , The Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forte .

On some shows , everyone was supposed to be perfecty average , perfectly regular , perfectly unobjectionable . That 's how we got The Brady Bunch and lots of other stories that wrapped up in a half-hour without bothering anybody . It 's not that there were no strange ideas , like Gilligan 's Island and My Favorite Martian and so forth .

@@37206570 @6206570/ <p> Pemiscot Memorial had plans for expansion and improvements that the county hospital was ready to make " and pay for " in 2005 , before the state legislature slashed Medicaid rolls . <p> Bram Sable-Smith/Side Effects Public Media <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> Originally published on June 22 , 2017 11:07 am <p> For the hundreds of rural U.S. hospitals struggling to stay in business , health policy decisions made in Washington , D.C. , this summer could make survival a lot tougher . <p> Since 2010 , at least 79 rural hospitals have closed across the country , and nearly 700 more are at risk of closing . These hospitals serve a largely older , poorer and sicker population than most hospitals , making them particularly vulnerable to changes made to Medicaid funding . <p> " A lot of hospitals like ours could get hurt , " says Kerry Noble , CEO of Pemiscot Memorial Health Systems , which runs the public hospital in Pemiscot County , one of the poorest in Missouri . <p> The GOP 's American Health Care Act would cut Medicaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and elderly Americans , as well as people with disabilities " by as much as $834 billion . The Congressional Budget Office has said that would result in 23 million more people being uninsured in the next 10 years . Even more could lose coverage under the budget proposed by President Trump , which suggests an additional $610 billion in cuts to the program . <p> That is a problem for small rural hospitals like Pemiscot Memorial , which depend on Medicaid . The hospital serves an agricultural county that ranks worst in Missouri for most health indicators , including premature deaths , quality of life and even adult smoking rates . Closing the county 's hospital could make those much worse . <p> And a rural hospital closure goes beyond people losing health care . Jobs , property values and even schools can suffer . Pemiscot County already has the state 's highest unemployment rate . Losing the hospital would mean losing the county 's largest employer . <p> " It would be devastating economically , " Noble says . " Our annual payrolls are around $20 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble 's mind when he ponders the hospital 's future . Pemiscot 's story is a lesson in how decisions made by state and federal lawmakers have put these small hospitals on the edge of collapse . <p> Back in 2005 , things were very different . The hospital was doing well , and Noble commissioned a $16 million plan to completely overhaul the facility , which was built in 1951 . <p> " We were going to pay for the first phase of that in cash . We did n't even need to borrow any money for it , " Noble says while thumbing through the old blueprints in his office at the hospital . <p> But those renovations never happened . In 2005 , the Missouri legislature passed sweeping cuts to Medicaid . More than 100,000 Missourians lost their health coverage , and this had an immediate impact on Pemiscot Memorial 's bottom line . About 40 percent of their patients were enrolled in Medicaid at the time , and nearly half of them lost their insurance in the cuts . <p> Those now-uninsured patients still needed care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial had to take them in . <p> " So we 're still providing care , but we 're no longer being compensated , " Noble says . <p> And as the cost of treating the uninsured went up , the hospital 's already slim margins shrunk . The hospital went into survival mode . <p> The Affordable Care Act was supposed to help with the problem of uncompensated care . It offered rural hospitals a potential lifeline by giving states the option to expand Medicaid to a larger segment of their populations . In Missouri , that would have covered about 300,000 people . <p> " It was the fundamental building block of the ACA that was supposed to cover low-income Americans , " says Sidney Watson , a St. Louis University health law professor . <p> In Missouri , Kerry Noble and Pemiscot Memorial became the poster children for Medicaid expansion . In 2013 , Noble went to the state capital to make the case for expansion on behalf of the hospital . <p> " Our facility will no longer be in existence if this expansion does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference . <p> " Medicaid cuts are always hard to rural hospitals , " Watson says . " People have less employer-sponsored coverage in rural areas and people are relying more on Medicaid and on Medicare . " <p> But the Missouri legislature voted against expansion . <p> For now , the doors of Pemiscot Memorial are still open . The hospital has cut some costly programs " like obstetrics " outsourced its ambulance service and has skipped upgrades . <p> " People might look at us and say , ' See , you did n't need Medicaid expansion . You 're still there , ' " Noble says . " But how long are we going to be here if we do n't get some relief ? " <p> Relief for rural hospitals is not what is being debated in Washington right now . Under the GOP House plan , even states like Missouri that did not expand Medicaid could see tens of thousands of residents losing their Medicaid coverage . <p> This story is part of NPR 's reporting partnership with KBIA , Side Effects Public Media and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Association of Health Care Journalists and The Commonwealth Fund . <p> There are new mammogram guidelines out today . They say women between the ages of 40 and 50 who are considered to be at average risk for breast cancer may opt to hold off on routine screenings . The guidance comes from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Barbara Levy is the group 's vice president of health policy . She joined us to explain the change . <p> BARBARA LEVY : For women at average risk , we are recommending that there is a conversation and shared decision-making starting at age 40 . And that between ages 40 and 50 women may choose not to be screened , they may choose to be screened every year or every two years based upon her values and how she looks at the literature and the data that we have so far . Beginning at age 50 , we are recommending every one- to two-year mammograms until at least age 75 . <p> CORNISH : So it sounds like the shift is that at age 40 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially saying , please do this . <p> LEVY : That 's exactly right . What we 're saying is that there are more cancers in women as women get older . And so the balance of risks and benefits is clearly in favor of screening beginning at 50 . Beginning at 40 , we have a lot more false positives , a lot more callbacks , a lot more biopsies that do n't turn into anything . And so that value assessment of how likely is the screening to show something that will impact my life is much more problematic between 40 and 50 . <p> CORNISH : So what if you yourself finds a lump and you 're in your 40s , you 're of average risk ? <p> LEVY : If you feel a lump in your breast , you must go see a provider and have that assessed whether you had a normal mammogram a month ago or not . <p> CORNISH : So for a lot of people listening , and I know for me - I feel like I ca n't keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted this update ? <p> LEVY : Yes . I mean , women are confused and doctors are confused . There are so many different things out there . And what we 've tried to do is pull that all together into something that says breast cancer is n't one disease . We used to think of it as cancer is cancer . But now we know that there are very , very slow growing cancers that might never kill somebody and there are very rapidly growing cancers that will come up in between screening . And that 's not something we can screen for . So it 's really time to sit down with our patients and help our patients understand all of that complexity and make choices that are the best for her and her own values . <p> CORNISH : So given that , what 's your response to people who look at the guidelines and will argue that annual mammograms save lives and that cutting back on them could be a problem ? <p> LEVY : So the issue is how many women will we treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How many women will we subject to biopsies , to chemotherapy , to radiation who would never have needed it versus how many women might die ? And those are statistics based on populations . And the reality is that breast cancer 's a very personal thing . It happens to individuals . And so the issue about screening is the guidelines are based on population data , not based on what an individual woman might face . <p> CORNISH : Is this a moment that feels to you like some kind of consensus - right ? - in the medical community about what women should do about mammograms ? <p> LEVY : So I think we 're coming to a consensus that says that the data are messy , studies are not perfect , and the answers are not black and white . But the consensus is here are the information pieces that you can use to make a value judgment for yourself . <p> CORNISH : Dr. Barbara Levy is vice president of health policy for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .

And it does n't look like it 's slowing down anytime soon . <p> Women in South Korea have gained a whopping 8 inches in height , on average , in the past century " the biggest jump of any other population in the world , researchers report Tuesday . <p> For men , Iranians are the big winners , gaining 6.5 inches in the past hundred years . <p> In contrast , Americans are falling behind . Back in 1914 , we had the third tallest men and fourth tallest women in the world . Now we 're in the middle of the pack , ranking around 40th for both men and women . <p> The stats on average national heights come from a giant study published in the journal eLife , which looks at how heights around the world have changed over the past century . <p> The data are chock-full of interesting nuggets of information : <p> American stagnation : In the past century , Americans have n't actually grown very much " only about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both the tallest men and women back in 1914 . But today , the Baltic countries reign supreme .

They retain that title today , but have grown about five inches . <p> The gender gap : Men are taller than women in every country by about 5 inches , on average . A century ago , that difference was slightly lower , at 4 inches . <p> Here in the U.S. , heights have plateaued " or even started to declined slightly . They peaked in 1988 for women and 1996 for men . <p> " There was a time when the U.S. was the land of plenty , " says Majid Ezzati , of Imperial College London , who helped to lead the study . " But increasingly over time , the quality of nutrition has worsened . " <p> Income inequality has increased in the U.S. since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In some sense , you have a large part of the population who are not getting quality food , " Ezzati says . " That drags down the whole place . " <p> The decline here may also be due , in part , to immigration from Central America and South Asia , where people tend to be shorter , Ezzati says . <p> For the study , Ezzati and nearly 800 scientists combed through about 1,500 surveys to come up with the measured heights for about 18.6 million people in 200 countries . <p> East Asians stood out for their exceptional growth . Eighteen-year-olds in Japan , China and South Korea are much taller today than a century ago . While growth in Japan has started to decline a bit , like the countries in the West , China and South Korea continue to climb the height ladder . <p> Africa may be rising economically , but its people are shrinking . In many countries , 18-year-old men have gotten shorter since the 1970s and 1960s , after the end of the colonial era . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets and agricultural budgets by large amounts , " Ezzati says . " Those who were affected the most were the poorest . " <p> Although genes play a big role in determining how many inches we sprout up during childhood , average height is a great litmus test for the overall health of a population . <p> Nutrition and the number of childhood infections help determine how tall you grow . " And there 's increasingly good evidence that people who are taller on average tend to live longer , " Ezzati says . <p> In contrast , shorter people have a lower risk for some cancers , such as colon cancer , Ezzati says . " But on the balance , it 's better to be taller , healthwise . " <p> And having extra inches as a kid is also connected to success later in life . " Being taller is actually a good marker of better educational attainment and higher income , " he adds . " Those are big changes with big benefits to society . "

Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his condition as a state of unresponsive wakefulness .

North Koreans never responded . They never said yes or no . They never agreed to have me visit as I have in the past - a total mystery but obviously a real cover-up . <p> MCEVERS : What do you think happened ? <p> RICHARDSON : What I think happened is that the North Koreans engaged in some kind of interrogation , and the interrogation went wrong , that it affected his brain , that he then went into a coma . I do n't think they 're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner . Yeah , he 's a bargaining chip , but there 's no reason why he might have been tortured . <p> But with the North Koreans in the past , you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits , humanitarian assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea now , we could make a deal with his father on prisoners , and we 've been able to but not with this man .

What do we know about them ? What does this mean for the efforts to get them released ? <p> RICHARDSON : Well , if the North Koreans are smart , they 'll let them go as a gesture of contrition and goodwill after this disaster . They were visited by the American diplomat in North Korea when he went to get Otto . I suspect they 're in - I wo n't say good condition , but at least they 're there .

Secondly , we need to make sure that there 's transparency on their part , maybe a human rights investigation by the U.N . But I would n't be opposed to putting more sanctions on North Korea . I do n't think the military option makes any sense . I think eventually diplomacy must rule but not for now .

@@37206593 @6206593/ <p> Bernie Sanders greets supporters at an election-night rally on June 7 in Santa Monica , Calif . <p> Scott Olson / Getty Images <p> Originally published on June 22 , 2016 9:54 am <p> In the runup to this election season , The Party Decides seemed to be on every political science nerd 's reading list . The 2008 book by political scientists Marty Cohen , David Karol , Hans Noel and John Zaller laid out how the invisible primary " party elites ' behind-the-scenes machinations before primary season " plays a heavy role in shaping nominations . One big idea : When party members line up definitively behind one candidate ( in the form of endorsements ) during that invisible primary , that candidate wins . <p> But the parties found themselves threatened this year . The GOP did n't decisively pick one person , but it quite clearly did not decide on Donald Trump . He received zero major GOP endorsements until well after the first primaries , and yet here he is , at the top of the GOP 's November ticket . Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the number of endorsements , yet he gave her a tougher fight than almost anyone expected . <p> We talked to Cohen about how he views the 2016 election " if it 's changed how he thinks , as well as how parties could again strengthen their grips on nominations . Our Q&amp;A is below ( edited for length and clarity ) . <p> Danielle Kurtzleben : As a political scientist , what about the 2016 election has changed how you think or challenged what you considered conventional wisdom ? <p> Marty Cohen : I think the extent to which politics has become celebrity-driven has just been epitomized and reached its logical conclusion in this election cycle . I remember 20-some years ago having some friends in D.C. , and they either worked on campaigns or they were just going to school , and they were starting to take pictures with politicians . <p> Politicians started to feel to me like celebrities . That was like 20 years ago , and I think we 've just steadily continued that trend . And it 's obviously epitomized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which celebrity is prized in our society and has infiltrated politics is shocking to me . And the extent to which the mistruths and the falsehoods of the Internet have been mainstreamed into American politics , mostly through Donald Trump , but also through Carly Fiorina and her assertions regarding that Planned Parenthood video that never existed . <p> Things that are very easy to debunk are gaining currency in politics , and we 've lost the gatekeeper . We 've lost the ability to have rational conversations based on facts , and falsehoods are just not checked . And so I guess that has surprised me that we 've gotten to this point . And I think it 's not new ; I think it 's been building . It 's just kind of exploded this year . <p> OK , so the logical follow-up to that is : How do we get out of it ? <p> The way you get out of it is if it results in disaster , and people are shocked into , " This is not what we want for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need like a shock to the system . <p> And if Donald Trump were to be elected president , I think that could be a sufficient shock to sort of move us back toward " not necessarily to what was a noble past in politics , but clearly a time when there was some more collegiality , there was some more bipartisanship , there was some more realization that there were common problems that needed to be solved . And that you could trust that people were basing their views on facts . <p> How to get out of it , I do n't know . I mean , a lot of things have gone into this trend : polarization and ultrapartisanship . Some of it , we 're not going to be able to put the toothpaste back in the tube . <p> You ca n't get rid of the Facebook echo chamber , I guess . <p> Yeah . And the proliferation of outlets , and that sort of thing . Gerrymandering is something , campaign finance , the fact that all these safe districts represent people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center . That can be changed . And it certainly could change in some states . <p> But I do n't know if it would have the desired effect . So that 's not clear what that sort of reform would be . <p> So let 's talk about your book . For the people who have n't read it , give us a quick summation . What do you mean by " The Party Decides " ? <p> We believe that the party consists of a group of what we call " intense policy demanders " : people who want something out of politics and want policies . They pay attention to politics . They put a lot of effort into it . And they 're looking for a return on their investment of time , effort and often money . One of the things that they do in order to try to assure themselves of getting favorable policy is to try to control their nomination . It 's much easier to get a friendly candidate into office than to try to negotiate with someone who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried " through negotiations and compromises and conversations " to figure out which presidential candidate is most acceptable to the broadest range of the party factions . And once they 've figured that out , they try to put their resources behind that person so that they can become the nominee and present a united front in the general election . <p> You focus on the importance of endorsements . I 'm wondering " Jeb Bush started out with a big endorsement lead , and Clinton did , too , but then she got a run for her money " does this year 's election change how you think ? <p> First of all , on the Republican side , we collected the data now , and as far as endorsements are concerned , no one had a mass of endorsements . There was a very , very wide spread of endorsements between six or seven candidates . No one was at all close to being the runaway leader in endorsements . <p> And compared with years past , very few people relatively were endorsing before Iowa . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There 's a number of reasons we think that occurred . But one thing for sure is that Donald Trump , the eventual nominee , did n't have any endorsements . <p> So it was n't that someone was the leader in endorsements and was overtaken and blown away by Donald Trump . There was no real party consensus at all this time around on the Republican side , in complete contrast to the Democratic side , where everybody was endorsing , and they were all endorsing Hillary . <p> So that 's the facts on the ground in terms of the endorsement derby . <p> What this election cycle tells us is that parties try to unify behind a broadly acceptable candidate , but there 's also the appeal of factional candidates . <p> Donald Trump we do n't think of necessarily as a factional candidate because he does n't really represent a faction of the Republican Party , but he attracted a certain type of voter that is well-represented within the Republican Party . <p> So maybe the GOP did n't line up behind one candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up against another candidate , in the sense that people were n't endorsing Trump . Why did n't that stop him ? <p> I think you found that for the longest time , they did n't do anything really about it . They did n't start running ads against him until after Iowa . They did n't start coalescing behind other candidates until after Iowa . And while they did n't necessarily want Trump , they did n't make a concerted effort to stop him until it was too late . <p> So is this year , with all of its outsider candidates , a one-off , or is it part of a pattern ? We 've had a few of these outsider or anti-establishent candidates in the past few years , aided by technology , like with Howard Dean and then Barack Obama , to a lesser degree . <p> There 's a real possibility that we 're already into a different era ... that probably began in 2004 . And like you said , Trump may be a little bit of a fluke of a candidacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online fundraising , online advertising , the ability to mount an insurgent campaign without party support . <p> Obama was much less an outsider even than Sanders , in terms of insider support . <p> Right . Obama spoke at the 2004 convention . <p> But still , you 're right . It 's certainly about challenging the establishment favorite . The most recent cycles since 2000 , which seemed to be the epitome of the , if you want to call it now , the old system , where George W. Bush and Al Gore racked up the endorsements and really sort of coasted to the nomination . <p> Since then , you look at the Internet , you look at Fox News and the 24-hour news channels , and on the Republican side more recently , just the general fracturing , the inability to create consensus . The Democrats are much more of a consensus-based party right now than Republicans . Republicans have a lot of factions to them that are difficult " especially , the people that Trump appealed to already had splintered off as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And sometimes it 's harder for parties to unify than it is in other periods . <p> So if things are changing , and there is that growing ability to , as you put it , mount an insurgent campaign , does that weaken your theory at all ? <p> We still think we described that period of time pretty well . I do n't think that it 's unthinkable that we could return to another period of relative party insider control . <p> The Republicans are going to , I think , make a big effort to not let something like this happen again . So you can forgive them for maybe not remembering what can happen if you let the voters decide , and they let the voters decide by being passive in the invisible primary , and they got what they got . <p> There 's calls on the Democratic side to make the process more open , and even on the Republican side , too . But there 's going to be a lot of people looking at Donald Trump 's nomination as a cautionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act together as a political party and try to control your nomination . <p> So there could be a backlash to that . And you could see tighter insider control return , quite possibly . <p> My inclination during this campaign has been to think , " Man , parties are getting weaker . " Do you think that 's true ? <p> Parties definitely have gone through spells where they 've been weaker and strong . You have progressive reforms in the 19th and 20th century that were designed specifically to weaken parties . <p> But parties rebounded . And then the McGovern-Fraser Commission reforms of the late ' 60s and early ' 70s tried to take control of the nomination process and give it to the people . And for a couple of cycles , it was wild and crazy , and the voters were clearly deciding , and then the party readjusted . <p> So I think you 're right that the pendulum does swing . But that 's what parties do , is control the nominations . That 's kind of their reason for being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform , " and that 's kind of what we had in mind is that parties had beat reform in the 1960s and then kind of reasserted themselves . So are they going to be able to beat back technology and beat back media ? Maybe they 'll figure out a way to do that . <p> It seems like the relationship between candidate and party used to be more symbiotic , whereas now , if I 'm Donald Trump , maybe I can say , " I do n't need the Republican Party as much as I might have in , say , 1996 . " Or is it just that the Republican brand is that important ? <p> He might think he does n't need the Republican Party , but all the criticism from the Republican Party is going to take its toll . The Republican Party at some point can cut bait , essentially , and let him go and focus on as best they can the House and Senate . In which case it would be very difficult for him to win " even more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you do need the party apparatus . You need the party brand . And parties again are uniquely qualified to do certain things , and that is to win elections and mobilize voters and to set the agenda . So for him to go it alone essentially , I do n't think that 's a winning strategy . <p> The way we 're trying to think about it " we 're working on a piece that we 're going to be publishing in the fall " is there are incentives for parties to unify , and there 's also a goal , an important reason to unify " to create party unity " but there are also incentives and pushes toward factionalism . And factionalism won on the Republican side this time . <p> So maybe since 2004 , it 's harder for parties to unify around one particular candidate and shepherd them to the nomination . <p> We check in on - the races for seats in both the U.S. Senate and House , taking - stock of who the candidates are in each race , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what issues might define the upcoming months of campaigning here in New Hampshire , including the- opioid- crisis and gun control .

My experiences show that we have one really significant challenge in New Hampshire . We have to get younger , and it will not be enough for New Hampshire to simply keep more of the kids that are being raised in New Hampshire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history - the mills in Manchester , if you look at tech more recently , if you look at Portsmouth today - we 've had times where we 've done a really good job of getting what we 'll call the sub-45 set to come to New Hampshire . <p> The mission has to be , we have to be an amazing place for people , especially 45 and under , to come to New Hampshire to live , to work , to start a family and to start a business . What I see are four policy areas that , if we do them right , we can be where New Hampshire has to be for the next twenty years . <p> At the top of that list is school building construction , which has been frozen at the state level for a number of years . If that is , as you say , the biggest infrastructure investment the state can make , how do you get that back into the state budget and convince people we need to do it ? <p> First , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a governor to instill confidence that when you say something , that you need that math , that you need those dollars , and you prioritize it very high , that people will see it 's the result of a process that they can trust . This is a guy - me - who 's a lifelong Democrat but has been praised by editorial boards from the Portsmouth Herald to the New Hampshire Union Leader for being fiscally responsible and being really smart with how we raise and how we spend money . And yet I 'm also somebody who 's proudly pro-choice , pro same-sex marriage , transgender rights , a strong environmentalist , anti-casino gambling . You can do that and you can be fiscally responsible . <p> The number one thing businesses told me was , if the school district around where they 're thinking of putting a business or expanding a business , if it is seen as outstanding , they will win time after time the tiebreakers for the kind of talent , particularly from out of state , that we have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in the next twenty years . <p> Let 's talk about some of the policy in the news lately . What , if anything , would you change about the state 's response to the opioid crisis ? <p> The good news on the opioid and heroin crisis is that , in a quite bipartisan way , in many examples , we have begun to turn that corner quickly . I praise Governor Hassan and some leaders , especially in the State Senate , Republicans and Democrats who get it , and they 're working . However , before I decided to run for governor I was the chair of the Government Affairs committee of the Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce . I asked a bunch of businesspeople , what are the priorities for the next few years ? Because I thought that 's what I 'd be doing the next few years . They said things like affordable housing and transportation and parking - and then they put in heroin in the same place . The reason they did , they said , is it 's now at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people who ca n't pass a drug test . They 're not in the position to be able to be a productive part of a diminishing workforce . <p> The good news is that the solution is not a ton of money , necessarily . It is some legislative changes , it is more effective use of the state 's database . Some of it , frankly , is cultural . It requires that we have to be more aggressive in fully funding drug courts , to really get us in a position where we 're not trying to punish and incarcerate , we 're trying to rehabilitate and get towards recovery . And in terms of the wait list , which is where the real problem is - we have 13 health zones in the state . In most of those we have a waiting list . We have people on a weekly basis dying , waiting on the waiting list . So I sat down with a bunch of people trying to start recovery centers around the state , and sat down and did budgets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to price it out . The price tag ? Smaller than you 'd think . <p> So this is where state government is an appropriate place for funding , because the private sector , the philanthropic sector are not able to provide steady streams of dollars to be able to buttress up what is typically about $300,000-$500,000 a year on average , per recovery center , to be able to give them confidence that they can budget for twelve months out . This is an $8-10 million initiative that I 've been looking at . I thought it would be in the context of a Seacoast-based solution . When I started running for governor I realized I could take some of this background and apply it to raising the dialogue at a statewide level . This is a key priority : it 's opioid abuse , it 's getting America 's best pre-K through 12 public education , it 's getting our infrastructure from below average to something we can really brag about , and it 's becoming America 's number one place for an entrepreneur to start a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marijuana , and if so , under what conditions ? <p> I favor the legalization of marijuana . First of all , I do not think it 's a gateway drug to other drugs . Second of all , we have seen lots of studies that we actually reduce use in certain groups . You legalize it , you regulate it , you tax it . We can actually do something here that can help public health by reducing its use under 21 and doing it responsibly for those that , frankly , are probably already doing it over the age of 21 . <p> Governor Hassan recently vetoed a bill essentially to do away with permits for concealed carry of guns . Was that the right decision , or no ? <p> You should have a permit , and I agree with Governor Hassan 's decision . I think if you get a background check and you 're seen as somebody that is not a threat to others in having a gun , I think that it 's totally appropriate to have one . I support the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we generally have not had the same kinds of issues as some larger and , frankly , more urban-based states . I 'm somebody that is not looking to make big changes on that but I would have supported Governor Hassan 's veto of that recently . <p> In looking back through your background , I found an article from 2008 about how the Democratic former mayor of Portsmouth , Steve Marchand , would get into political debates with his wife , Sandi Hennequin , who was a Republican . Are you two still debating here in 2016 , and if so , what have you made of the state of national politics over the past year ? <p> Wow , good Google search . Number one , it took running for governor to get my wife to register undeclared . If I 'd known that I would have run for governor a long time ago , right ? All jokes aside , we agree on some issues - we both , for example , would repeal the death penalty .

I will speak fondly of Rudman and consider him a mentor , but we need to look forward . I 'm definitely a creature of today as well ; things do need to be done differently . But what has n't changed - and I hear it everywhere - people do tell me , and I 'm talking about the conservative Republican voters , those are the people that I 'm talking to right now : they want something done on the gridlock .

The voters of the 1st District want representation , they want trust in their representative , and they want someone who knows how to solve problems , and I 'm going to be those things . <p> On the issues you mentioned : you had a piece in the Union Leader this week talking about federal fiscal policy .

The other thing I think that concerned me about Mrs. Kuster is - I hate to say partisan , but if you look at my record in Concord , for example , I get along great with Democrats . We do n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approachable , I 've co-sponsored a number of bills - the prescription drug monitoring program , it was either going to be me or Rep. Peter Schmidt out of Dover , I think , and Peter put his name on first but I was more than happy to put my name on it second . <p> I think we can get things done a little bit easier than , say , Mrs. Kuster . Here 's another example : the gas pipeline . I 've been against the Kinder Morgan pipeline since February of 2015 . She was sort of late to the party ; she came in December and now all of a sudden she 's putting legislation through to have an ombudsman to help the citizens . That 's great , but even if you have somebody advocating for us , all the federal government has to do is say there 's a need - and , by the way , there 's no definition of what " need " is . <p> This is what I mean by effectiveness . I 'm well-respected , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Majority Leader . I think we got a lot of things done statewide - we went from an $8 million Rainy Day Fund to $80 million . We balanced our budget . We made it easier for companies to stay in the state . We made some changes to Common Core testing . We cut down the number of tests , and at the secondary level , 11th grade , we enacted the SATs instead of the Smarter Balanced Assessment , which President Obama a month and a half later said , if you wanted to do it this way , you could - but we had already done it earlier in the year . I think we did a lot of good things . <p> There are a significant number of Republicans saying it 's better to stand on principle than to potentially compromise or water down those principles through legislative deals . What do you make of that argument ? <p> We do have core principles - smaller government , more efficient government , less regulations , more local control , meaning the state . But sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loaf before you get the whole loaf . You do n't always get everything you want . When the House freshmen come in , I tell them , " Do you want to be right or do you want to be effective ? " <p> You 've proposed changes to the tax code to help close the budget deficit - what about spending , any changes there ? <p> It 's funny you bring that up , because even in Concord , I had an incentive for employees to find cost savings in our budget . Someone said to me , Jack , you worry about the pennies and the nickels , and I said , yeah , but if you worry about the pennies and the nickels the dimes and dollars take care of themselves . <p> I 'm not a big wasteful spender ; I 'm not a big spender . If we need to spend something , then we do it . That 's what government is about , providing services for the public good . My legislative philosophy is , does it make sense ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it constitutional ? Not necessarily in that order , but that 's the way I look at legislation , that 's the way I look at spending . <p> Talk about waste , too - there are a lot of regulations that each one of these agencies is putting out . In Concord , we have what 's called JLCAR , Joint Legislative Committee on Agency Rules . The agency has to come in front of this joint legislative - Senators and Representatives - and say why they want to change these rules . They do n't have that in Washington , DC , but I would advocate for that at that level , because regulations are another thing that are hurting our businesses . There 's a record low number of small businesses - I think we 're like 46th in the world . A country like the United States , who pride themselves on entrepreneurship ? We 're not creating businesses anymore . Part of it is the regulatory environment . <p> On foreign policy , you 've said the US needs to have a presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Syria , and perhaps a military presence . Obviously conditions change , but right now , what would you envision that presence looking like - and to what end ? <p> Syrians do n't really want to leave Syria , they just want a safe place in their country , and I think it would behoove us , instead of bringing all these people into our country where we ca n't vet them , send in the Marines into Syria and say , this is the line . Then we send the Army Corps of Engineers and build buildings , places for them to stay and sleep and establish their own territory . It might be better off for everyone . <p> We do have allies in the Middle East - Jordan is one , Saudi Arabia 's another , obviously Israel , so having a presence there , being able to scramble jets and things like that , would n't necessarily be a bad thing . <p> What about social issues like abortion or same-sex marriage ? How would you describe yourself ? <p> On the abortion issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have taken positions like , for example , late-term abortion other than the life of the mother , rape and incest . And I believe there was another bill that passed that I supported that said a minor could not get an abortion without parental consent or going in front of a judge , and the judge actually had to give a recommendation , I believe , within two days , to proceed . With limitations , I would say I 'm pro-choice . <p> I 'm a traditional marriage person - I think it 's 3,000 years and ticking . However , I do n't think someone just wakes up in the morning and says , " I think I 'll be gay today . " <p> Among your hobbies : motorcycles . What do you ride ? <p> I started in 1973 - shows you how old I was - I still do it , but not very often because I do n't have much time . I race motocross , dirt bikes . Last year I had a little accident , breaking five ribs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it 's a form of exercise , it 's a distraction .

Why was this the right time to launch a bid for the corner office ? <p> For the last several years I 've been out talking about some of my experiences in state government - I , in fact , wrote a book about that - and a lot of what I was talking about goes on in Washington as well as Concord .

I think that 's who I am . We rank 40th in the country in outward migration of young people , per capita . We are now the second-oldest state in the country . Yes , we have a 2.6 percent unemployment rate , but that really belies the fact that we do n't have enough educated workers . Some 50 percent of our population has some degree of higher education . It 's been shown that by 2025 we need to have almost 70 percent of our population have some degree of higher education or certificate learning . If we do n't do that , we will not maintain the same standard of living we have today . <p> If I 'm elected , that will be my point . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what we need to do - we 're doing it somewhat in terms of education . It includes how we fund it , how we prioritize education , how we get kids thinking - the 58,000 kids in high school today - how we tell them this is where they want to be to start a family , this is the opportunity here , instead of them just leaving and not coming back . If we do n't address this challenge in the next couple of years , we could lose a generation . That 's what we need to focus on in the state . <p> Let 's take a look at some of the other issues that have been in the news lately . What , if anything , would you do differently about the state 's response to opioid abuse . <p> I do n't think I 'd do anything differently - this is an issue that we did n't even understand two years ago or even a year ago . The legislature and the governor - particularly the governor - has shown leadership here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal crisis ; drug courts , getting those in place in all our counties ; prescription monitoring program and strengthening that . The people who deal in this , we need to put away ; the people who are victimized we need to help . I was with some firefighters about a month ago in Manchester . They took me around - they go out and treat somebody , and they put them in an ambulance and bring them to the hospital and then these people check out right away . And they 're telling me , the same day or the very next day , they 're seeing the same people again . <p> When we bring them into the hospital , we should have interdiction right then and there , to say , you just almost killed yourself . Let 's get you treatment . And we 're starting to do that .

The governor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for addressing this , but we can do more . <p> You support passenger rail . How would you try to move rail forward at a time when lawmakers have repeatedly removed rail funding from the state 's transportation plan ? <p> This , to me , is about innovation in our economy . This is what my theme is - I want us to be the Live Free or Die state , obviously that 's who we are , but I also want us to be the innovation and education state . Innovation to me means you can not just have an economy based on automobiles . <p> The actual capital and operating expense to do this is somewhere around $5-6 million in my opinion . Just look at the amount of economic development that will come off of that . We 'll have increased taxes for business profits tax , rooms and meals tax , more parking revenue - I 'll say this . If you look at the gas tax that we put up 4.1 cents about two years ago - it was the first time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the legislature . It happened because of the business community .

Now they 're saying , we really need passenger rail . <p> If you look at New England and you look at Boston and you look at GE that 's moved from Connecticut to Boston , and you look at the hospitals and universities , we need to tie ourselves as closely as possible to Boston and that community . Linking Boston to Nashua , Manchester , to the Manchester Millyard , that 's a home run . It takes the right kind of leadership , someone who understands finance , someone who understands what it takes to get things done . I think my record in terms of what I 've done for the state and my business background - I will get it done . <p> Would you support a bill to decriminalize possession of marijuana , and if so , under what conditions ? <p> Yes , I would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , and see some of these people who almost bankrupted our economy , and none of these people who went to jail .

I 'm not saying marijuana should be something we should promote , but we have to be realistic in terms of what 's happening in our society . I think it 's time for us to do that . <p> There 's a bill moving through the legislature now which its proponents call constitutional carry , which would essentially remove the need for concealed weapons permits for firearms .

@@37206611 @6206611/ <p> That 's not quite as heretical as it sounds . Austen wrote the book early in her career , before Pride and Prejudice . It was n't published in her lifetime . The title is n't even hers " it did n't have one . <p> It 's an epistolary work , told via letters , and , as such , missing Austen 's all-important voice as narrator . Her protagonist , Lady Susan Vernon , is an impoverished widow with designs on a married lord and a malign indifference to her own teenage daughter . She seems a pale copy of the villainess of another epistolary novel that was widely-read at the time , Les Liaisons Dangereuse . <p> Early in Love &amp; Friendship you realize that Stillman does n't hate Lady Susan nearly as much as Austen seems to . The woman 's will must be thwarted , of course , for the sake of her spirited daughter . But as played by Kate Beckinsale , she cuts an impressive figure . She 's attractive , she 's indefatigable , and she 's poetically eloquent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left the estate of one Lord Manwaring after enchanting the host and driving the hostess , Lady Manwaring , to despair .

She charms him , but unnerves his wife , Lady Catherine DeCourcy Vernon , an unusually empathetic woman played by the delightful Emma Greenwell . <p> Just as alarming to Lady Catherine is the behavior of her younger brother , Reginald DeCourcy , played by Xavier Samuel with a bit of Hugh Grant 's adorable lockjaw . Reginald claims to want to study Lady Susan 's wiles from an anthropological perspective , but he seems more and more seduced by them . <p> You might be thinking , " That 's a lot of names to keep track of " " and I 've cited only a few . Stillman helps by presenting the characters one or two at a time , with accompanying title cards and descriptions . It 's still hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection for the milieu that makes you want to use words like " bespeaks .

Sir James is pomp-and-gloriously played by Tom Bennett , who reminded me of Peter Cook as one of his impervious-to-reality titled Englishmen . But Lady Susan insists that Frederica acquiesce to this idiot 's affections . <p> Beckinsale 's attack is driving and precise , her diction so sharp it can draw blood . And Stillman has given her amazing lines , some " but not all " culled from the novella 's letters .

The performance , though , makes you realize why Sevigny is so wonderful in other roles : Her dreamy rhythms are uniquely her own . And I do n't care for Stillman 's dullish title , Love &amp; Friendship .

McConnell tapped a 13-member working group last month to hash out senators ' differences over the House-passed American Health Care Act . McConnell 's office has since taken the lead drafting the Senate version of the party 's long-promised legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act . <p> Senate Republicans have been coy " or simply out of the loop " on the specifics in the Senate plan , but here is what we know about what might be in the bill and where it could be headed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the House passed AHCA in early May , leading senators asserted that the Senate would go their own way . " We 're writing a Senate bill and not passing the House bill , " Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , said then . " We 'll take whatever good ideas we find there that meet our goals . " <p> In the end , those goals appear to be aligned . <p> The structure of the Senate bill , as described by GOP senators and aides , appears fundamentally the same as the House-passed plan . <p> The Senate bill is also expected to repeal the individual mandate and all or most of the ACA 's taxes , phase out the Medicaid expansion as well as change how the Medicaid program is funded , establish a system of tax credits to help people buy insurance if they choose , and make it easier for states to opt-out of the ACA 's mandates for preexisting conditions and minimum insurance coverage mandates . <p> There will be changes . For instance , the Senate version is expected to include more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get hit with higher costs . Republicans are also battling over how best to remake the Medicaid program , with key vote senators like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia sounding skittish about Medicaid reductions . <p> Other Republicans are excited by the bill . Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyo. , has been one of the most vocal advocates for Obamacare repeal . " People did n't want to have to buy this product . This is a sinking ship , people are ready to jump off , " he said Tuesday . Republicans like Barrasso see the bill as a win for the GOP and for the promises they made on the campaign trail . <p> " We eliminate the individual mandate . You 'll see more people as free citizens making a decision to not have Obamacare insurance , but certainly have more freedom , " Barrasso said . <p> The Process Stinks <p> " Can you say it was done openly ? With transparency and accountability ? Without backroom deals and struck behind closed doors ? Hidden from the people ? Hell no you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the reconciliation bill ? Have you read the manager 's amendment ? Hell no you have n't ! " <p> The Senate has not held any public hearings on their health care bill ( the House did ) , senators involved in the talks have been tight-lipped on the substance , and the public will only have a few days to see it before it gets a vote . <p> McConnell brushed off questions about transparency . " They 'll have plenty of time , " he told reporters Tuesday . " We 've been discussing all the elements of this endlessly for seven years . Everybody pretty well understands it . Everybody will have adequate time to take a look at it . " <p> That argument rings hollow with some of his fellow Republicans . " We used to complain like hell when the Democrats ran the Affordable Care Act . Now , we 're doing the same thing , " Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , told CNN . <p> " If you 're frustrated in the lack of transparency in this process , I share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a Facebook video for his constituents .

" I just have n't been able to see it yet and as far as I know the overwhelming majority of my colleagues have n't been able to see it either . " <p> Failure Is An Option <p> McConnell has been quietly leading Republicans ' to a vote next week but that does n't mean it 's going to pass . <p> " We 're going to make every effort to pass a bill that dramatically changes the current health care law , " McConnell said when asked if he has the votes . <p> " I think the leader has made it pretty clear we 're going to vote , one way or another , and hopefully we 'll have 50 votes when that time comes , " Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune said when asked if he believed McConnell would bring a bill to the floor that did n't have the votes to pass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , McConnell has only a two-vote margin of error with many senators voicing problems with the legislation . <p> " If our bill comes in with greater subsidies than Obamacare , it makes it hard for conservatives to support a bill that actually has greater subsidies than Obamacare , " Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , told reporters in regards to the tax credits in the GOP plan . " That for me is a nonstarter . " <p> Conservatives like Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee have Utah have been skeptical about the bill 's ability to ultimately lower premium costs for Americans . Both are seen as potential ' no ' votes on the bill . <p> More moderate senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are also seen as potential ' no ' votes on the other end of the spectrum . <p> Defeat of the House-passed bill would n't necessarily end the health care debate in Congress , but it would redefine it . <p> Wisconsin GOP Sen.

Let 's stabilize the markets and then , long-term , work with the Democrats colleagues to actually fix the healthcare system , " Johnson said . <p> The White House Does n't Love It " Yet <p> The White House has maintained a light tough when it comes to shaping the policies in the health care bill , but President Trump reportedly told a group of senators last week that the bill passed in the House was " mean " and he wanted the final bill to do more to help needier Americans . <p> On Tuesday , White House Spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president " wants a bill that has heart in it " but did not offer any specific policies Trump wants in the bill .

The House either needs to pass the Senate bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House and Senate have to go into a third round of negotiations in which both chambers would have to vote again on a final , compromise bill . <p> Either way , the health care debate is likely to continue into July if the Senate can pass a bill next week . <p> Democrats Debate How Far To Take Their Fight <p> Senate Democrats ca n't filibuster the bill because it 's protected under special budget rules and only requires a majority vote . They 're all going to oppose it , but they ca n't ultimately stop it from eventually getting an up-or-down vote . <p> Democrats have started a series of protests this week that could intensify as the Senate approaches that vote . They held the floor Monday evening for a series of speeches in opposition to the bill .

That 's when a very unfortunate whaling vessel arrives and harpoons a whale , setting the thing on a rampage . It wo n't take long for readers put the pieces together : The creature is the Monster " as in Frankenstein 's monster " and his encounter with the whaling ship sets him on a mission to destroy , pitting him against the humanity that rejected him centuries ago . <p> That 's the premise of Destroyer , a new six-issue , limited-series comic by the author Victor LaValle , which hit comic book stands earlier this month . ( He also has a new novel out this month , called The Changeling . ) <p> LaValle has long married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true here in Destroyer : The last living member of the Frankenstein line in the modern day happens to be a woman named Josephine Baker , a brilliant African-American scientist overwrought with grief after her 12-year-old son is killed by a police officer . But Baker , like her notorious forebear , has the means to bring the dead back to life , and she unknowingly puts her family 's legacies " her resurrected son and her ancestor 's rage-filled abomination " on a collision course . <p> I talked with Victor LaValle to talk about why he thought the Frankenstein myth lends itself to an exploration of the fallout of modern police violence . Here 's our conversation , edited for length and clarity : <p> So much really effective horror literalizes the specific cultural anxieties of the moment , and this comic is very much about the desire for a parent whose child has been killed by the police to overcome death . Why 'd you choose Frankenstein as the way into that idea ? <p> It 's one of the first science fiction novels , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of it in Mary Shelley 's emotional life . She 's the daughter of a woman who died giving birth to her , and she held on to this grief all her life : that she did n't know herself . Her mother , Mary Wollstonecraft , was a pretty famous woman herself . A suffragette , a vegan " <p> A vegan ? <p> Frankenstein 's monster is actually a vegan in her novel ! It 's a very minor thing , but he talks very proudly about how he lives entirely off berries and grass " which is impressive because he 's eight feet tall , so he 's got to eat a lot of berries ! But Shelley lost her mother at birth ... and then she runs off with Percy Shelley . Their first kid together was born premature , and a couple months into the baby 's life , Mary Shelley walks into the nursery room and finds the baby dead in its crib . She writes in her journal : " Found baby dead . Very bad day . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long after that , Lord Byron and Percy and she all go off on their famous trip where they all say , " Let 's come up with ghost stories . Let 's come up with something really spooky . " It 's in that context that she comes up with this story about a man who tries to bring the dead back to life . <p> I wanted to explore that kind of grief , that desire " forget Victor Frankenstein 's desire but what I read as Mary Shelley 's desire " to bring back who you love and to wish for that power not simply out of hubris , but to see the one you love back again . <p> There 's no way I could n't think of in 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , all these black parents , and particularly black mothers " black mothers on the news that I see wrecked by the murders of their children . And it occurred to me that this is on some level the same urge . If I were to say to any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring back your child ? " <p> I felt pretty sure the answer would be " Yes , I 'd do anything . " And so I thought of Frankenstein 's monster , and this is how I would make it relevant to today and not this old rehash but a continuation of these really essential ideas and a way to talk about issues that are up to the moment , unfortunately . <p> In the first issue , you synopsize the circumstances under which the young boy , whose name we do n't learn , is shot by the police , although we do n't initially see his killing . <p> His name is Akai . <p> GD : Like Akai Gurley ? Gurley was an unarmed Brooklyn man who was shot by a police officer while walking down a pitch-black stairwell in a public housing complex in 2014 . The officer in that shooting was fired by the police department and later convicted of manslaughter . <p> I did n't want to call him " Tamir " like Tamir Rice because it seemed too ghoulish . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people knew , it would be hard to see this character as a character , and there were ways that readers might demand a more literal version of him . But Akai Gurley did n't become a national story , even though his story was just as horrible . And I thought , here 's a tiny way I can keep his name alive . <p> It 's clear that Akai and the Monster are going to cross paths , and Josephine Baker is going to have to deal with her family 's legacy . So she 's the great-great-great " a descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein ? <p> The only Frankenstein who lives in Mary Shelley 's novel is Edward Frankenstein , one of Victor 's younger brothers . When Victor Frankenstein destroys the mate he was making for the Monster , the Monster says " I will be with you on your wedding night . " And then the Monster shows up and kills Victor 's seven-year-old brother then he kills the woman Victor was going to marry then he kills Victor 's father . He basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only one who survives and because of what happened in Europe , he comes to America . Eventually , as these things happen , the last living descendant of the Frankenstein line is Josephine Baker . <p> A black woman . <p> A black woman . In the later issues , there 's the suggestion of , " Well , why could n't she be a Frankenstein ? " Why would you assume she was n't ? Especially if you know how the world works " particularly how America works . <p> Were people skeptical about the plausibility of that ? <p> No , but I was anticipating skepticism . Like sometimes , being used to degrees of ignorance or prejudice , I start coming up with explanations or retorts to things that do n't even come up . I just said , she 's the last Frankenstein , and my editors were like , " OK , sounds good . " <p> You say in the afterword that you never read the novel until you started working on this project . And full disclosure , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those touchstones that 's so iconic that most people probably think they know the rough outline . <p> Yeah , as I wrote in the afterword , the novel is so much weirder than its offspring . I departed from the Boris Karloff Frankenstein depiction ... <p> With the bolts in the neck . <p> Right , and the flat head and also ' the innocent monster . ' That 's a real change from the book . The sweet Monster who just wants to be loved , that 's in the book . But when Victor Frankenstein rejects him , he basically is like , " OK , well I 'm going to become a serial killer ! " And that part magically stays out of the later Frankenstein stuff . Because I think it makes the Monster " in a good way " complicated , but for popular entertainment , makes him less simple and sympathetic . <p> Your characterization of the Monster in Destroyer is that he 's a rampaging , unstoppable force . <p> At the end of the novel , the Monster sees Victor Frankenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So my thing is he 's got several hundred years apart from humanity . I do n't see what humanity has done over those 200 years that would make anyone have a softer view of humanity . <p> There are lots of people who would argue on the other end , that there 's a lot of good . But this version of the Monster , will be like , " All your good intentions , they do n't mean anything . All I look at is the ways in which you have wrecked this world . I 'm at war with you . " Toward the end of Mary Shelley 's novel , the Monster says that he is at war with humanity . And I liked the idea of this Monster who is just a being of rage . It 's going to be a very grim depiction of the Monster . <p> But that 's going to be juxtaposed by this other character who is brought back from the dead , in Akai . He 's a 12-year-old , and he 's not going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 12-year-old , and he 's a sweet 12-year-old . So one , I wanted to show just a sweet black boy , just to have that as something you see in the comic , because I feel like you do n't see that anywhere . And then two , the overarching battle on the spiritual level is Josephine , who is teetering between madness and sanity because of her grief at the loss of her son . And then you have these two literal embodiments of those choices : the Monster , on one end , is just the impulse to give in to grief and rage , and to just say " I 'm sick of humanity , let 's just kill everyone . " And on the other end is Akai , who is , despite even what happened to him , still imbued with the spirit of hope . And to say , " look how amazing it is , Mom , through your brilliance and technology , there 's still a chance for good in the world to still exist . " <p> But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even if Josephine brought back this sweet kid from the dead , she 's still doing something that is ethically ... let 's , say , murky . <p> The return of her son and the return of the Monster will force her into a larger consideration of many of the ethical choices she has made up to this point , and to make her have to stop having blinders on about her responsibility and her culpability in some of the harsh thing that her brilliance has brought into the world . The two guys who come looking for Josephine in the first issue work for a woman who is the director of this thing called the Lab . And they have been doing , as they must always do , " secret government experiments . " Laughs . And Josephine was always the brilliant scientist at the heart of those experiments , but those experiments came with a cost as well . <p> Did she stop working at the Lab after Akai was killed by the police ? <p> It was because of the birth of Akai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . But I do really want to wrestle with some real-world things , and as women talk about quite a bit , you get pregnant at a high-powered job and they push you out . Even the people who are higher up , they lose confidence in you as a serious professional . So outside of the superpowers and the bringing-back-the-dead stuff , I wanted to deal with how hard it is to be an ambitious woman within an organization . It 's harder than it is to be an ambitious man . <p> In the first issue , we see an allusion to the police dispatch call that leads to the police encounter in which Akai is killed . Did you model the way his killing happened on any of the specific stories of black people being killed by the police in the last few years ? <p> That call is literally the call that is the beginning of Tamir Rice 's murder . I went and found the transcripts between the dispatcher and the police who eventually showed up . The part we hear is the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come to the scene . <p> Whenever one of these stories happen , there 's always this impulse to decontextualize it . This person made that choice and that person made that choice and those choices seem to exist inside this sphere that only involve the people immediately involved . We do n't appreciate the forces that bring a random black kid and a random police officer into contact , even though those things happen literally thousands of times a day . Not necessarily shootings like Tamir Rice 's , but there 's nothing aberrant about those encounters with the police . And there 's a whole bunch of reasons , you know , why Akai Gurley was in a place where he had this encounter while he was just walking down a stairwell ... <p> Even down to how or why it was commonplace thing for the lights to be out in that building 's stairwell , so that that cop walks in extra nervous and wo n't even walk in the stairway . <p> What I was even more interested in setting up was this other thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was their courtship like ? When we finally get to the moment when we sort of replay the moment in which he is killed , I want it to feel like , I 've known this family since his parents met , since Josephine and his dad met at the lab . That all this life was ended there , and that all these lines of human existence that came to a close at that moment .

 deaths of the alpha female and the brother of alpha male " 755 , " two prime males find the family 's maturing females to their liking . After two jealous sisters eject another sister from the pack " seen here " she wanders out of the park and is also shot . <p> Alva 's take on the book differs from mine . I was enthralled with Safina 's blend of stories from his time in the field with elephants , wolves and orcas ( killer whales ) and the people who study them , especially with the way he blended those stories with the latest science of animal minds . <p> Over the weekend , I interviewed Safina by email . What follows is our conversation , edited for length . <p> The segment of the book about Yellowstone wolves was a huge favorite of mine . Could you choose one wolf whom you observed and whose behavior made a big impact on you , and say why " and why this type of knowledge matters ? <p> Wolf packs are nuclear families , much like ours , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the offspring mature , they leave to seek their own lives and take their own chances , as do our kids . Yellowstone 's Lamar Valley pack was unusual in having three adults : the breeders and the brother of the breeding male . This non-breeding brother had an avuncular role and liked to watch the pups more than he liked to hunt . In 2012 , when the pack wandered past our imaginary " park " border , they had no way of knowing that wolves had just been removed from the endangered species list and Wyoming had declared open season . The breeding female " a famous and much-watched , much loved wolf " and the avuncular male were soon shot despite their prominent research collars . <p> The remaining adult male ( the " alpha , " known as male 755 ) began wandering , probably first looking for his mate and brother , then looking for a new mate . Into the power vacuum wandered two prime males who found his family 's maturing females to their liking ; and their feeling was mutual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Further , two of 755 's female offspring appeared jealous of the attention being paid to a precocious sister . They ganged up to eject her from the pack ; an event I witnessed over several days . That female tried to re-enter but her sisters would not allow it . Alone , hungry , she wandered out , found a chicken coop , and was shot there . <p> So , for one thing , I saw how the killing of part of the family completely destabilized the lives of the survivors and resulted in an additional death . The father , 755 , who had been alpha male in the most-watched pack in Yellowstone , lost everything . Coming into winter , he had no company , no hunting partners , no safe territory , no support . I was certain he would soon die . But by skill and persistence he survived that winter . And the next . And two years later as a graying , aging wolf he is again in possession of a territory , a mate and , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family dynamics , the individuality , and the surprising survival power of one wolf with the worst odds was really amazing to me . <p> You write , " Humans are not the only animals who love one another . " I so completely agree ! You make the point that some animals recognize our ( human ) minds and hearts more readily than some of us may recognize theirs . Can you give an example ? How could this strange happenstance come to be ? <p> Injured animals from dolphins to manta rays sometimes seek and accept help from humans . Almost no one would have suspected that a manta ray would seek help , much less from us , yet various creatures seem to understand that we can understand . This is far more than most humans are willing to grant them , which means it 's far more than most humans are able to see . Killer whales have returned to researchers lost in fog , and guided them out . ' How can this be ? ' you ask . Well , I 'm not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing the same air we breathe . It means that other minds have evolved , but have not created stories of their own categorical superiority . The story of human exclusive superiority is mainly a Western one ; tribal peoples long respected , recognized and emulated the minds and abilities of other animals around them . <p> For such a compassionate person , you are awfully hard in your book on some scientists who do n't study wild animals , and on academic philosophers , too . This being the case , I have to ask : What did you think of Alva 's 13.7 post last week ? <p> Oh , geez . Well , only a professional academic philosopher could write something as consummately circular as , " The glowing smile is not evidence that she has positive emotions ; it is the veritable face of those emotions " " and actually think he has said anything . He misrepresented much of the book and simply missed the rest . He entirely skipped , for instance , everything I included about evolution and neurology as sources of insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book ! <p> You 're doing book tours now , but you 're also carving out time to spend in the field with animals , which I imagine is restorative , as is time at home with your family , which includes nonhumans . Can you tell us about any recent favorite animal experiences ? <p> Being near and around other animals is like my meditation . I get to be quiet and observe , alert to what 's around .

@@37206690 @6206690/ <p> For our ongoing series on the opioid crisis in New Hampshire , called Dangerous Ends , Weekend Edition talked with Dr. Sarah Akerman , director of addiction services at Dartmouth-Hitchcock and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Dartmouth 's Geisel School of Medicine . <p> - - What prompted Dartmouth-Hitchcock to first establish this program ? <p> We were noticing a trend beginning about two years ago . We , with our OB-GYN colleagues , began to think of ways to address the growing problem of opioid use , particularly heroin use , in pregnant women . We were finding that pregnant women did not really fit well into the traditional treatment model . They needed additional services , and we formed this multidisciplinary collaboration , and that 's really the foundation of our program , this close partnership with our OB-GYN and addiction psychiatry team , to develop a comprehensive model of treatment to really address the unique needs of this population . <p> Opioid use or abuse is not something a person is necessarily going to want to share with her OB-GYN . How do doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treated ? <p> That 's a great question . Women are , as you can imagine , often very reluctant to disclose their substance use , because they have fear there are going to be repercussions , or their babies may be taken away . What we 've done is implemented this evidence-based screening and intervention process , which , through a systematic way , is able to identify women that have problems through the use of various specific questions in a nonthreatening and nonjudgmental way , so that women feel comfortable and realize that treatment is there . Help is there . <p> That 's key , first identifying who needs the treatment . Then , having the treatment program in place - one of the things that 's unique about our program is that we try to bring as many programs on-site as possible , so women who come to our program come to a one-stop shop , where they get their addiction treatment , their counseling , medication treatment if that 's appropriate , they get their OB-GYN services on-site , and this is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about neonatal abstinence syndrome and various other things . <p> Not every substance has the same effect on infants and fetuses . What do we know about the effects of exposure to opioids in newborns ? <p> There 's the effect of the substance itself during the pregnancy ; then there 's also the effect of the drug-using lifestyle . Women who are using any substances are often not taking good care of themselves - not going to prenatal visits as much as they should , not eating well , not sleeping well . That can certainly have an effect on the pregnancy . <p> Then there 's the effect of the substances themselves . With certain substances like alcohol , we know there 's a specific fetal alcohol spectrum disorder we can see in babies . In babies exposed to opioids , what we see most commonly would be neonatal abstinence syndrome , and that 's true for babies exposed to illicit opioids and that 's actually true for babies exposed to prescribed opioids as well , including medications like Suboxone or Subutex . Babies experience neonatal abstinence syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the illicit opiate . <p> How well do these identification and treatment approaches work ? <p> Our program has been active for about the past two years - we started small and are growing . We have some preliminary outcome data available , and what we 're seeing is that we have very good treatment retention rates . More than 90 percent of pregnant women are staying in treatment for the course of their pregnancy , which is great , and they 're attending more prenatal care visits . They tend to be healthier overall - one piece of evidence being that they 're gaining weight well with the pregnancy . There 's decreased substance use across the board as women proceed through the program . <p> Some of the outcomes we 're seeing in babies are very encouraging as well . For babies born to moms in the program , there 's a lower percent of them requiring treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome . We 're seeing decreased length of stay for babies born to moms in our program , which translates into lower hospital costs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more , we 've seen a difference in how people talk about it and the policies they propose to deal with it - for example , chiefs of police now say we ca n't arrest our way out of the problem , we have to deal with treatment as well . Has there been a similar change in how health care providers talk about women who have opioid abuse issues during pregnancy ? <p> Yeah . I think , as we are all hearing , this is really an epidemic . We 're seeing more and more young women - there was some CDC data recently that demonstrated that one of the sharpest increases in heroin use was in young women ages 18 to 25 . When we consider the fact that close to 90 percent of pregnancies in young women abusing opioids such as heroin are unplanned , the result is we have an epidemic of heroin use in pregnant women . I think a lot of providers are realizing that and understanding that , and we hope that as the stories get out there 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they come into light . <p> As you look ahead over the next few years , what is it going to take to deal with this piece of the opioid crisis in New Hampshire ? <p> The fact that more providers and more facilities in the region are open to the possibility of devoting resources to the pregnant population is wonderful . I think the more people that can be involved in treatment , bringing these resources to women , both identifying them and referring them to treatment , actually bringing them to treatment , that in part is going to help the epidemic . 190094 @qwx390094 <p> Since appointed by Governor Hassan to lead the fight against an epidemic of heroin and opioid abuse , Wozmak has faced some political pushback and a budget impasse .

@@37206702 @6206702/ <p> This piece assumes you 've seen the first five seasons of Archer , which contain quite the pileup of plot developments , so : beware . <p> Every character on Archer is a creep . The animated FX comedy , which begins its sixth season Thursday night , features a rogues ' gallery of spies , bureaucrats , masterminds , hangers-on and double-dealers , and not one can be fully called sympathetic . Even agent Lana Kane ( Aisha Tyler ) , the closest Archer comes to having a moral center , has at some point violently assaulted ( and had sex with ) virtually every other major character . <p> The rest are , for the most part , even worse . Sterling Archer himself " played by H. Jon Benjamin , who also voices Bob on Bob 's Burgers " is utterly amoral , with the looks , means , firepower and reckless disregard for personal safety to act on his i 'd 's every whim . His mother , Malory Archer , is essentially Arrested Development 's Lucille Bluth if she were the money-hungry head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're both voiced by the great Jessica Walter . Many Arrested Development alums have turned up at some point here , including series regular Judy Greer . ) It 's hard to imagine describing any of Archer 's supporting players without touching on a fatal flaw " starting with addictions to sex , cocaine , heroin or glue , to say nothing of the likelihood that one is a clone of Adolf Hitler himself " and I have n't even gotten into how often the dialogue is yelled in various stages of distress . <p> And yet , when called upon to name my favorite pop-culture comfort food " the stuff I turn to when I want to relax , unwind and turn off the world outside " Archer has been among my top answers for years now . If the kids are n't within earshot ( the language and subject matter are strictly TV-MA ) and I 'm free to lounge around in my footie pajamas and shut out the world , it 's often Archer that gets deployed for funny background noise . <p> There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out exactly what it is : that , for all its bombast , explosions , smuttiness , endless barrage of funny shouted insults and occasional gore , this is a show with a clear , noisy , strangely comforting rhythm to it . It helps , of course , that nothing here really threatens to conjure images of everyday life " certainly not mine . <p> Really , nothing sounds like Archer , yet its pacing and patterns soon become perfectly familiar . Scenes are stitched together quickly via overlapping banter " one ends with a line that also applies to the beginning of the next " which keeps each half-hour episode hurtling along in a manner that 's seamless , almost agreeable . <p> Still , unlike The Simpsons and other animated shows that end each episode where it started , Archer 's story develops chronologically and decisively . The wonderful Pam Poovey ( Amber Nash ) begins the series as a hapless HR rep , but has since revealed a grim backstory , gone toe-to-toe with the dreaded Yakuza and picked up a raging cocaine habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . Gay field agent Ray Gillette , voiced by showrunner and series creator Adam Reed ( Frisky Dingo , Sealab 2021 ) , has been paralyzed , outfitted with bionic legs , re-paralyzed and reconstructed . After four seasons as a magnet for stray bullets , poor Brett Bunsen ( Neal Holman ) finally died at the top of season five , though he gets a brief but bloody callback tonight . <p> Elsewhere , the story hurtles on . After abandoning the spy trade for the drug trade last year , Archer 's characters resume espionage in the season-six premiere " albeit without the name ISIS , for reasons you might already have discerned . While Sterling Archer is sent off on a CIA-backed mission , others in the gang converge on their new/old headquarters " and , as is so often the case with this show , the workplace material hits harder and generates more laughs than the events in the field . Which , in turn , makes a good deal of sense : This is a show built on rhythms , the louder and more familiar the better .

It 's called PANDAS " Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections.A ' Mind-Boggling ' Connection <p> So , how could strep do this ? <p> Strep is an ancient bacteria , and one of the reasons it have been around so long is it 's good at hiding : strep camouflages against the throat by creating proteins that look like the body 's own tissue . So it takes the immune system time to find the infection " and when it does , the body kills the strep with antibodies . <p> But in PANDAS , the antibodies then keep fishing for strep " and they attack the body 's own proteins that look like the ones the strep had mimicked . <p> If the antibodies find those proteins in the heart valves , that leads to rheumatic fever . If they attack a part of the brain called the basal ganglia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The thought that you could actually present with symptoms of anxiety , obsessive compulsive disorder and movement abnormalities was a little bit mind boggling , frankly , " says Swedo . <p> One study found as many as 10 percent of children with OCD and tic disorders may have it because of strep antibodies : but even the science behind that is speculative . <p> One of Dr. Swedo 's studies documents the regression of fine motor skills in children with PANDAS through a series of drawings , pre- and post-onset of symptoms . <p> A Medical Mystery - Or Controversy ? <p> Swedo 's case is a tough sell to some in the medical community . After all : most kids get strep every year . <p> And here 's what makes it harder to believe : PANDAS is a medical condition , but the diagnosis is through clinical observations . <p> " You know you reach a point where you 're willing to believe things that may not be scientifically correct , " says Dr. Harvey Singer , a pediatric neurologist at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strep-PANDAS connection , he now says there is no definitive link . <p> " The thought that you could actually present with symptoms of anxiety , obsessive compulsive disorder and movement abnormalities was a little bit mind boggling , frankly . " <p> " And all we 're charging the physicians with is , look , you guys have a responsibility to prove what you 're doing , " says . Dr. Singer . <p> PANDAS has become Swedo 's professional - and personal - mission . She admires Dr. Barry Marshall , the Australian doctor who proved Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers . Other doctors did n't believe him . So Dr. Marshall drank the bacteria in a broth , and gave himself a nasty ulcer - definitively proving his point to the medical community . <p> Dr. Swedo says " it would be just absolutely fabulous " if she could give herself PANDAS . <p> " But I ca n't so I 've done the next best thing . I 've studied hundreds and hundreds of children and now have colleagues at 12 sites across the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed children with dormant PANDAS and found their symptoms spike when the child is exposed to a strep infection . <p> Families Lost In The Middle <p> Many in the medical community remain split on whether or not PANDAS actually exists . Other doctors have never even heard of it . <p> Meanwhile , families get lost in the middle , searching for a treatment for their kids . <p> The Nichols family , from left to right : Garret , Taylor , Jason , Emily , Kirsten and Ava . <p> The Nichols family lives in Keene . They have twin daughters who both got sick with PANDAS in the summer after finishing the eighth grade with high honors . They have both been hospitalized dozens of times - sometimes in two different states at the same time - for paralyzing anxiety and anorexia . <p> The Nichols girls at times have gone days without drinking water - for fear of calories . <p> " We have done everything in traditional medicine for the last two years , " says Emily Nichols , the twins ' mother .

" And because she 's got psych issues , the eating disorder units wo n't take her . " <p> Like Isak 's family , the Nichols learned about PANDAS from their own research ; then they sought out a doctor who treats it . But the Nichols twins got much sicker than Isak ever did .

In response to an NHPR inquiry , BCBS of Illinois did not say why the request was denied . <p> Dr. Richard Morse , a pediatric neurologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center , says about 70 percent of the kids he treats for PANDAS respond with antibiotics or steroids . Many of the others respond to IVIG and other more invasive treatments . <p> As further proof in the case of PANDAS , Morse points to the widening body of literature on autoimmune diseases impacting the brain . <p> Still , Morse says he respects the skepticism . In fact , he says , his colleagues at Dartmouth are split on the disorder . But he also says PANDAS is only now stepping out of the fringes of scientific understanding - and that is always a messy process . <p> " As science advances and as our knowledge increases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dr. Morse . " It usually lurches forward by vigorous debate and people taking strong positions of belief that they 're right . And ultimately time will tell . I think in the case of PANDAS time is telling . " <p> Although big questions are unanswered . It seems children can outgrow PANDAS , but we do n't know why . There are no FDA-approved treatments , yet Swedo 's team is researching drugs like IVIG . <p> Antibiotics worked for Isak . <p> Lost And Found <p> After three years , the McCunes found a doctor in Boston who diagnosed Isak with PANDAS .

It crosses land owned by many different people and organizations and they might object to goats . Goats might disrupt the ecology by eating endangered native plants or by introducing foreign plants to the trail in their droppings . Remaley also said the park service must protect other hikers .

Goats are considered pack animals under federal law . Forbidding pack animals is one of the few rules on the Trail and I 'm glad to see that they are enforced .

The only people that would even have knowledge of this story would be those that were positive and intrigued enough for me to get their e-mail address .

The thought of permitting them on the trail makes me shudder . The destructive capability ( and speed ) of even a single goat has to be witnessed in action to be believed , and a goat left permitted to forage around a campsite for a couple of hours would very efficiently defoliate a sizable area . <p> I hiked the pacific crest trail in 2005 . I started hiking with my goat but despite having a stock permit for the goat we were kicked out of Kings Canyon NP . Goats are much less damaging than the horses and mules that are legally allowed to hike on the PCT . I find it likewise ridiculous that with all the damage a dog can cause on the AT , a goat is not allowed .

@@37206751 @6206751/ <h> The Courtroom Challenge To Mary Baker Eddy And Christian Science <p> A new book is shining a light on an unusual chapter in the life of the founder of Christian Science , Mary Baker Eddy . <p> In the second half of the 19th Century , the New Hampshire native was a wealthy and prominent public figure . But toward the end of her life , Eddy faced a legal challenge to her wealth and her fitness to manage her own affairs " and it came in part from inside her own family . <p> Historian Peter Wallner is the author of the book Faith on Trial : Mary Baker Eddy , Christian Science and the First Amendment . He previously wrote an acclaimed two-volume biography of New Hampshire 's only US president , Franklin Pierce . Wallner will speak about the book Wednesday afternoon at the New Hampshire Historical Society in Concord . <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> 6:49 <p> Historian Peter Wallner talks with NHPR 's Brady Carlson . <p> Mary Baker Eddy is in her mid-eighties when this suit begins . How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the public attitudes toward her and toward Christian Science ? <p> She was considered by Mark Twain and others to be the most famous woman in America at this time . She had moved to Concord in 1889 from Boston , and at that time , people thought she was moving into semi-retirement . She was very much in charge of her life and her church , but nevertheless because she was so difficult to get in contact with , especially for the media or even for her adopted son and her biological son , there was some sense that maybe she was not competent and that maybe she was being held under control by Christian Science church officials , who were somehow misappropriating her wealth and controlling what they thought might be an incompetent old woman . She was far from that . <p> Eddy 's sons play roles in this lawsuit . What are they looking to do ? <p> That 's an interesting point . I think they had different motives . Her biological son had been estranged from her for many years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raised by people in Minnesota , and he had become an illiterate prospector . He needed her money ; he wanted her wealth . <p> Her adopted son was out for revenge , because he felt his relationship with his stepmother had been undermined by Christian Science officials , and so he 'd been sort of drummed out of the Christian Science church and out of Mary Baker Eddy 's affections . So he joined the plaintiffs in the case , I think largely to get revenge on Christian Science officials . <p> That , then , becomes the crux of the case - it 's not so much about whether Mary Baker Eddy can handle her own affairs , but Christian Science itself . <p> Yes . And that was n't even the motives of the son or adopted son , that was the motives of the press and the lawyers in the case . They were out to discredit Christian Science ; they thought the religion itself was dangerous , that it was against science , that it believed in health care by mental reasons rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dangerous . So they used , in many cases , the son and adopted son for their own purposes , which was to get at Christian Science . <p> How does that play out in the courtroom ? How do lawyers essentially try to put this school of religious thought to the test ? <p> What Eddy did was very smart . Over a time , she and her lawyer , Frank Streeter , from Concord , had a media campaign in which they brought in reporters and psychiatrists to study her and to interview her . Reporters and photographers came out in the press with stories that said she was quite sane and quite in charge of her life . So by the time the case went to court in August of 1907 , it was pretty obvious to the plaintiffs that she was at least going to make a decent showing if she was interviewed by the court . Therefore they turned their attention entirely to her views on religion , claiming that they showed her delusions and showed her to be insane or suffering from senile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to listen to a lot of talk about her religion . They simply did not believe you could connect a religion to the fact that she was incompetent . So they ruled out all evidence prior to 1890 - and most of the witnesses that the plaintiffs had gathered were people who knew her in her early days of Christian Science , when her religion did seem to be somewhat superstitious in many ways . She had changed her views quite a bit by 1906 , 1907 . Nevertheless , the court had ruled out all of the testimony prior to 1890 , and in doing so the plaintiffs were left without much of a case . So they asked the court to dismiss the case , they dropped the charges . And they did this partly because they felt it would be easier to prove that she was incompetent and insane after she died . Therefore , they would challenge her will . <p> And she did live for several more years . <p> She lived until December 1910 ; she died at 89 1/2 .

And she gave her adopted son $45,000 - it does n't sound like a lot today , but of course in 1907 it was quite a bit of money . <p> Nevertheless , when she died , they still challenged her will . In both cases , of course , they failed again to challenge her will and they had to accept the $245,000 and $45,000 settlements that she had given . <p> Does this case set any precedents or have any lasting effect in our legal system about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I think it does in the sense that basically the courts , in 1907 , decided that anything regarding someone 's religious beliefs was simply not subject to legal court action . It was basically decided that there was nothing about her religion that was relevant to whether or not she was a competent person or whether or not she was in charge of her religion . The court simply refused to deal with that ; they simply- accepted the idea that people could believe whatever they wanted . It did n't necessarily affect their competency to handle their financial affairs- or their daily lives . <p> What do you think you 've learned- about Mary Baker Eddy- from studying this episode in- her life ? <p> I did n't come away- believing in Christian Science , - particularly , but I thought she was at least a very honest person in what she believed in .

The presidency today , the post-Cold War presidency , is actually this entity of several hundred individuals where you have the people who are in the line of succession as outlined by the 25th Amendment : the president , the vice president , the speaker of the house , the president pro tempore of the Senate , and then all of the cabinet officials . <p> But then each of those cabinet officials also has their own line of succession , which can be 15 or 20 people long . In most cases it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something happens to the Capitol you have a set of people and a set of leaders who could reassemble government from outside of Washington . But you end up with this very obscure set of people that would really surprise most of us who were left standing after an attack . <p> On misconceptions about the nuclear football <p> The nuclear football is the briefcase that follows the president wherever he goes , and it 's carried by a military aide . Contrary to pop culture or public perception , there is no such thing as the red phone or the nuclear button . What the nuclear football entails is basically a bunch of binders with different plans . One military aide compared it to a Denny 's menu . You can go through and point at different pictures and that 's the type of nuclear war you would order . ... <p> The military aide would come up and hand these binders to the president . The president carries with him a little sealed index card that he would break open that 's designed by the NSA , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify him to the military command structure as the president . And then , from there , he would be able to launch nuclear war whenever he was . <p> On protocol around a presidential launch order <p> The way that these procedures have evolved over the years is to remove any middlemen that could slow the process down , because the decision-making window would be so short as it is . The president might only have 8 to 10 to 12 minutes to make a decision about launching a nuclear weapon . There would n't be any time to double check with someone else , so we have very carefully crafted a system that ensures that there 's nothing that slows down a presidential launch order . Those plans were always predicated upon the idea that the person giving the launch order is the most thoughtful , most intelligent , most sober-minded individual that you could possibly imagine atop the nuclear command and control system . <p> On the subtitle of the book : " The Story of the U.S. Government 's Secret Plan to Save Itself--While the Rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1940s and 1950s with the grandest of hopes and ambitions " the idea that we 'll be able to evacuate all of our urban centers , that nuclear war could be survivable with a little bit of warning . Then we watch over the course of the Cold War as the weapons get faster , we go from bombers to missiles , and then they get stronger . We go from nuclear bombs , atomic bombs , to thermonuclear bombs , to hydrogen bombs . <p> And then we also see the arsenals expand . They go from a few dozen or a few score bombs to the tens of thousands of weapons that we had by the end of the Cold War , and that combination of stronger , faster , more numerous weapons means that the government 's ambitions shrunk over the course of the Cold War , until they effectively are what they are today , which is : The civilian population will be left to itself for weeks or months at a time , and a small number of senior government officials will be spirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a few years they 're able to reconstitute something that resembles the United States again . <p> This is FRESH AIR . I 'm Terry Gross . There 's a mix of the terrifying , the absurd and the bureaucratic in my guest Garrett Graff 's new book about the government 's secret plans for continuity of government in case we 're attacked by nuclear or chemical or biological weapons . Based in part on recently declassified documents , it describes the secret bunkers to protect government leaders , what the nuclear football is designed to do , who 's designated to succeed the president and other leaders in case they 're killed , which agency lists the dead , et cetera . <p> Garrett Graff 's book is called " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself - While The Rest Of Us Die . " Graff is a former editor of Washingtonian magazine and Politico Magazine . He 's also a contributing writer to Wired magazine . Garrett Graff , welcome to FRESH AIR . Why did you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the government going ? <p> GARRETT GRAFF : I 've covered national security for , you know , better part of a decade in Washington , and you bump up against these programs in - when you 're writing about other related subjects . I mean I 've talked to people who had been evacuated on 9/11 to some of these facilities . I 've talked to people who had been involved in these plans during the Obama years or the Bush years . But my interest was really peaked actually when one of my colleagues at Washingtonian magazine , when I was working there , came in one day with a government I 'd that he had found on the floor of one of the Metro parking garages , the subway parking garages in D.C. And it was a government I 'd for someone from the intelligence community . And he gave it to me since I write about that subject . And he 's , like , I figure you can get this back to the guy . <p> And so I look at the I 'd , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions on the back of the I 'd . And I am curious where these lead , and so I get on Google Maps and Google satellite , and I follow this road out through Virginia out into West Virginia and figure out on the satellite that the road dead ends into the side of a mountain . <p> GROSS : ( Laughter ) . <p> GRAFF : And you can sort of see very clearly these big concrete bunker doors , this little guard shack , you know , chain-link fence and then this set of concrete bunker doors beyond . And it was a facility that I had never heard of , that was n't on any map . And I was like , wow , like , this is one of these facilities that I 've heard about . But this is one of the new ones . Like , this is something that has been built and added since 9/11 as part of the modern incarnation of these plans . And it just made me so curious to go back and understand what the history of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as well . <p> GROSS : Another thing I 'd say about that is it means your I 'd is a constant reminder that nuclear apocalypse might be imminent , and you have to go to an assigned place if it happens . <p> GRAFF : Yeah . And that 's really in my mind one of the most interesting aspects of these plans - is this strange mix of these very concrete , you know , black-and-white plans written down and very neatly organized into , you know , documents and binders and maps and then the way that they interact with human psychology over the course of them and the way that the people who are supposed to be evacuated to these mountain bunkers or up into these airborne command posts or out to these special ships at sea struggle with the psychological weight of realizing that they are chosen to be the ones who will survive an apocalypse even when their colleagues and their families may not . <p> There 's a story I tell in the book about George Stephanopoulos when he was at the Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the research for what became " The West Wing " and " The American President , " was meeting with Stephanopoulos . Stephanopoulos pulls out this little evacuation card that Aaron Sorkin originally thinks is a bus pass only to realize that it 's actually , you know , George Stephanopoulos ' **27;91;TOOLONG card . <p> And then when Aaron Sorkin incorporates this into a " West Wing " episode where the deputy chief of staff , Josh Lyman , gets one of these cards from the National Security Council , Dee Dee Myers , who was the press secretary at the time - the White House press secretary at the time - pulls Aaron Sorkin aside on the set and says , you know , Aaron , I think that this is crazy that you 're doing this because these cards do n't actually exist . And Aaron Sorkin realizes in that moment that Dee Dee Myers , who worked alongside George Stephanopoulos in the White House , never realized that she was not going to be saved in an evacuation but that George Stephanopoulos was . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunker . Would you describe where that bunker is and what you know about it ? <p> GRAFF : The Raven Rock bunker is in Waynesboro , Pa. , or just outside Waynesboro , Pa. , not far from Camp David , just over the Pennsylvania side of the Maryland line . And it 's a bunker that dates back to the late 1940s , right at the beginning of the Atomic Age as the government began to think about what it was going to mean to build evacuation facilities in case something happened to Washington . <p> And Raven Rock is this massive , hollowed-out mountain . I mean it 's a free-standing city inside , you know , with individual buildings - three-story buildings built inside of this mountain . And it has everything that a small city would . I mean there 's a fire department there . There 's a police department , medical facilities , dining halls . The dining facility serves four meals a day . It 's a 24-hour facility . And it has been - it was sort of mothballed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then was restarted in a hurry after 9/11 and has been pretty dramatically expanded over the last 15 years and , you know , today could hold as many as 5,000 people in the event of an emergency . <p> GROSS : So you have these underground bunkers the size of cities in case of nuclear attack to protect members of government and keep the government going . You say that these places are staffed 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . <p> GRAFF : Yes . They are staffed 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . And it 's not just the bunkers . Right as we are sitting here talking today , there is a presidential doomsday plane , these converted 747s that are known as the Nightwatch planes . There are four of them . They 've been in existence for the last quarter century . And one of them is sitting on a runway in Omaha , Neb. , at Offutt Air Force Base right now . Its engines are on . It 's fully staffed with everyone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's ready to launch in a 15-minute alert in the event of an emergency and rendezvous with the president wherever he may end up being and evacuate him . And then the president would be able to lead a nuclear war from the air aboard one of these 747 Nightwatch planes for three days before he would have to land and survey what had become of the United States . <p> GROSS : One of the plans , called Plan C , is a secret plan to suspend peacetime civil liberties and arrest thousands of potential , quote , " subversives , " and force foreigners to register . When is that plan from , and is it still active ? <p> GRAFF : So this plan dates back to the 1950s and 1960s . You know , a lot of people today are familiar with the president 's nuclear football , the black briefcase that follows the president wherever he goes . Well , for much of the Cold War , the attorney general was also followed around by basically the attorney general 's football . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for martial law and suspending civil liberties , these pre-written lists that J. Edgar Hoover maintained when he was director of the FBI of known and suspected subversives and foreign aliens around the country . <p> I mean , tens of thousands of people who would be arrested and rounded up in the opening moments of an emergency like nuclear war or some type of major international crisis . These plans existed in forms that we now understand during the 1950s and 1960s . And while those specific drafts of those plans have been retired and are even some of them declassified today , which is how we know about them , there 's every reason to believe that there are modern analogs to these plans as well . <p> I mean , sort of draft legislation and draft executive orders sitting in safes , in bunkers and in emergency binders around Washington that could be unveiled in the moment of national emergency today and filled in almost " Mad Lib " style with , you know , a few dates , a few targets or names of what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation or an executive order ready to go . <p> GROSS : But you do n't know what that document is or where it might be , but you 're speculating that it probably exists . <p> GRAFF : Yeah . And we know that there are drafts of many of these plans that exist in modern times because we get sort of brief windows here and there into secret law and secret executive orders that presidents sign . And we may not know anything more than the title of the document or we may even just know that because all of the number - all of these executive orders are numbered . <p> When you realize that the government is skipping a number or two in an executive order , that means that there has been a secret executive order that we do n't know what that means yet . You know , almost half of President Obama 's national security decision memos , as they were called , were classified at the time . <p> And we may not know anything really about what they entail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans in the modern times . <p> GROSS : There was a plan in the 1950s during the Eisenhower era for business leaders to take control of government if government leaders were all killed . Is that - do I have that right ? <p> GRAFF : Yeah , so this was a plan that Eisenhower put together in the latter half of his administration where he sort of pre-deputized private sector business leaders - CEOs , even his personal accountant at one point - who would step in and be wartime czars . I mean , they would really seize national assets . <p> I mean , there would be sort of someone in charge of , let 's say , manufacturing , someone else in charge of housing . And they would have these , you know , czar , you know , almost dictatorial powers to seize assets and nationalize industries and set wages and prices . And almost any aspect of the national economy would be run by one of these eight men in the event of a national emergency . <p> And they had these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would step into these roles and had even sort of pre-deputized some of their own deputies and staff so that they would have a staff ready to seize control with them in the event of an emergency . <p> GROSS : Let me reintroduce you here . If you 're just joining us , my guest is Garrett Graff . And his new book is called " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself -- While The Rest Of Us Die . " We 'll be right back . This is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF MATT ULERY 'S " GAVE PROOF " ) <p> GROSS : This is FRESH AIR , and if you 're just joining us , my guest is journalist Garrett Graff . His new book is called " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself -- While The Rest Of Us Die . " It 's about the plans for continuity of government in case of nuclear attack or a similar catastrophe . <p> There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assume there still is a plan , for what to do if the president is killed or the vice president or members of Congress . It 's called the continuity of government plan . What can you tell us about that ? <p> GRAFF : So the continuity of government plan is sort of the umbrella term for all of these plans , both what would happen during a nuclear attack , sort of who would be in charge at any given moment , how that power would devolve through the line of succession . But then also , you know , what would happen after . And that 's where you have sort of some of the most interesting sets of these plans , I think , is the way that the U.S. government re-imagined its services and the way that it would help people after a nuclear attack . <p> But to the question of presidential succession , I mean , this , to me , is one of the most interesting aspects of these plans is the way that while we think of the presidency as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November , the presidency today , the post-Cold War presidency , is actually this entity of several hundred individuals . <p> You have the people who are in the line of succession , as outlined by the 25th Amendment - the president , the vice president , the speaker of the House , the president pro tem of the Senate and then all of the Cabinet officials . But then each of those Cabinet officials also has their own line of succession , which can be 15 or 20 people long and in most cases includes people and includes officials who are outside of Washington so that if something happens to the Capitol , you have a set of people and a set of leaders who could reassemble government from outside of Washington . <p> But you end up with sort of this very obscure set of people that would really surprise , you know , most of us who were left standing after an attack . The U.N . ambassador , the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Energy 's Savannah River Operations Center outside Savannah sort of all pop up and declare themselves the people who are in charge of our country after some sort of catastrophe in Washington . <p> GROSS : So you mentioned that the continuity of government plan re-imagines what some agencies ' services would be after a nuclear attack . And for the post office , in one of the plans , it would have been responsible for registering the nation 's dead , for keeping a list of everybody who died , which is - I 'm not sure why that would have been assigned to the post office . <p> But what a grave task to take on . Somebody 's got to do it . <p> GRAFF : Yeah , I mean , each government agency had , during the Cold War , sort of its post-apocalypse analog . The post office was the agency that would have been in charge of registering the dead and figuring out who was still alive in part because the post office knows where people live . <p> GROSS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would sort of understand , you know , who was left . And so you would arrive in the refugee camps after your cities had been destroyed . And you would have been handed form 810 from the post office , which were preprinted in millions and millions of quantities and , you know , located in post offices around the country through the Cold War in the event of an emergency . <p> And you would have filled it out with your name and family members that survived with you at the camp . And then the post office would have sort of sorted through these cards and figured out who was still alive and where everyone was to begin the process of reuniting families . Now , the Park Service , for instance , would have been the agency that would have actually been running , in many cases , the refugee camps because the thinking was that Park Service land would be largely untouched by nuclear war . <p> And you had , you know , even agencies like the IRS , of course . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so the IRS had all of their plans for how they would levy taxes on nuclear-damaged property and how they would raise revenue to keep the government going . The Federal Reserve built this bunker in Mount Pony , Va . where they kept $2 billion cash , which would have been the money that we would have needed to keep the economy going for 18 months , which was the length of time that they expected it would take us to begin printing currency again after a nuclear attack . <p> You know , the U.S. Department of Agriculture was the agency that would have been in charge of feeding the nation and , you know , sending out the rations and planning the rations for people in fallout shelters and then in refugee camps . And they , you know , worked for years with Nabisco to come up with this special survival biscuit that they premade about 160 million tons of this Nabisco survival wafer that were , you know , manufactured and boxed up in tins and then hidden away in government fallout shelters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a whole strange shadow post-apocalypse government that existed just out of sight through the Cold War . <p> GROSS : I wonder what happened to those Nabisco survival biscuits . <p> GRAFF : Well , so it 's sort of a funny story . They - many of them ended up ... <p> GROSS : You actually know what happened to them ( laughter ) ? <p> GRAFF : Well , so many of them ended up getting scrapped . But then every so often , people still stumble across , you know , a forgotten fallout shelter or something and come across , you know , stacks and stacks of these biscuits . New York City actually found one of these fallout shelters inside the Brooklyn Bridge a couple of years ago that was stocked full of , you know , several hundred tons - or several hundred pounds of these biscuits . <p> And so there 's this whole weird genre of these videos on YouTube of people opening up these 50 , 60-year-old tins of biscuits and , you know , taste testing the biscuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not particularly tasty when they were originally manufactured . And the consensus of all of the videos today is that they 're even less tasty today . <p> GROSS : Not a surprise . <p> GRAFF : No , not at all . <p> GROSS : My guest is Garrett Graff , author of the new book " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself -- While The Rest Of Us Die . " After a break , we 'll talk about what the nuclear football really is and what documents and American totems have been designated to be saved in doomsday scenarios . I 'm Terry Gross , and this is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF JOHN BUNCH TRIO 'S " WE 'LL MEET AGAIN " ) <p> GROSS : This is FRESH AIR . I 'm Terry Gross back with journalist Garrett Graff , who covers national security . His new book is about the government 's secret plans , starting with the Cold War , for continuity of government in case of nuclear attack . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself -- While The Rest Of Us Die . " Graff 's previous book was about the FBI under Robert Mueller , who is now the special counsel overseeing the Trump-Russia investigation . Graff is now a contributing writer for WIRED Magazine . <p> One of the most-visible , commonly known aspects of the nuclear plan is the nuclear football . And the nuclear football , you describe what it is . <p> GRAFF : The nuclear football is the briefcase that is - follows the president wherever he goes . And it 's carried by military aide . And contrary to sort of pop culture or public perception , there is no such thing as sort of the red phone or the nuclear button . What the the nuclear football entails is basically a bunch of binders with different plans . You know , one military aide compared it to a Denny 's menu . You know , you could sort of go through and point out different pictures , and that 's the type of nuclear war that you would order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide with the nuclear football . And we sort of often forget about it except for , you know , sort of weird moments like we had earlier this winter where there was a guest at Mar-a-Lago who snapped a selfie with the military aide carrying the football during a party that the president was attending and posted it on the Internet . <p> But the military aide would come up and hand these binders to the president . The president carries with him a little sealed index card that he would break open that 's designed by the NSA . And that card and the codes that are in it would identify him to the military command structure as the president , and then from there , he would be able to launch nuclear war wherever he was . <p> GROSS : When did this nuclear football originate ? <p> GRAFF : So the popular mythology is that it originated sort of soon after the Cuban missile crisis . And that 's where it sort of first came into the public imagination - was the idea that you needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to be ready with these plans wherever the president might be . The code name - so the nickname , the football , comes from the war plans that were in place at that point which were code named dropkick - and so dropkick being a football pun . And now the briefcase is called the football . <p> GROSS : Thank you for explaining that . It never made any sense to me . <p> GRAFF : ( Laughter ) . <p> GROSS : OK , so the nuclear football is n't a button that the president can push to launch nuclear war . It 's a set of plans that the president can put into effect . But the president can still put one of those effects - one of those plans into effect very quickly , almost as quickly as pressing a button . <p> GRAFF : Yes , and in fact that 's one of the things that is strange to think about in the context of these plans - is that everyone thinks that these plans , you know , have all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign off on them . But the truth of the matter is , we 've spent the last 70 years effectively stripping away every check and balance from the president 's ability to launch nuclear war in order to ensure that whenever or wherever he may give the launch order , it is carried out as efficiently and as effectively as it possibly can be . <p> And so there is no one else who has to OK a nuclear launch order . It 's just the president and then , you know , launch . And this has sort of caused some consternation during certain moments and crises in the past . I tell the story in the book about the final days of Nixon 's presidency where James Schlesinger , who was the defense secretary at the time , actually , according to him , gave the order to the Pentagon to disregard a presidential launch order because he was afraid that Richard Nixon would actually launch nuclear war . You know , in those final days , Nixon was deeply depressed . He was drinking heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , you know , truly rash and had , in fact , even threatened a group of congressmen that he might just launch nuclear war . <p> And so Schlesinger left this standing order with the Pentagon to disregard a presidential launch order unless it was verified by the secretary of defense or the secretary of state . But that 's not the way the system is supposed to work , and there 's no system like that in place today . You know , if the president gives the launch order , the missiles launch . <p> GROSS : That is very sobering . <p> GRAFF : It is , and this is a challenge that we sort of struggled with through the Cold War . And presidents , as they learned about these plans - I mean one of the first things that a president does actually even before he becomes president is he gets sat down and briefed on these nuclear war plans . And then presidents through the Cold War would participate in these wartime exercises aboard these presidential doomsday planes , or they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Weather and participate in nuclear launch drills and exercises . And it was a very deeply sobering experience for them . <p> And there 's fascinating documentation from Eisenhower and Kennedy and Carter and Johnson and Nixon , even Reagan of sort of the way that going through these exercises made them realize just how terrible nuclear war would actually be . One of the things that really I found just so striking and so poignant in looking back at these exercises is , when you have these nuclear war exercises , the president never actually participates because you do n't want the president to ever tip his hand of how he would respond to an exercise . <p> So there 's always some other government official who is playing the role of the president during these exercises . And what the people who ran the exercises realized was that these people who were playing the president would never actually give the launch order . Even though they knew it was an exercise , even though they knew that they did n't have the actual authority , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got launched , they as humans could n't bring themselves to actually give a nuclear launch order . <p> GROSS : If you 're just joining us , my guest is Garrett Graff . He 's the author of the new book " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself - While The Rest Of Us Die . " We 'll be right back . This is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC ) <p> GROSS : This is FRESH AIR . And if you 're just joining us , my guest is journalist Garrett Graff . His new book is called " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself - While The Rest Of Us Die . " <p> Fortunately , we 've never had a chance to check how these nuclear catastrophe scenarios would play out in reality . But we did have a catastrophe - that was 9/11 - in which - how much of these orders were actually launched then ? Did people go to their bunkers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our history that these plans were ever activated in an emergency . And you saw them sort of play out across the country . I mean the president - President Bush was put aboard Air Force One in Sarasota , Fla. , and evacuated up into the sky under sort of normal continuity of government procedures . <p> In Washington , you had officials evacuated to Raven Rock and Mount Weather , the two big bunkers around Washington , as well as a host of other smaller relocation facilities . And what we sort of came to realize on 9/11 is exactly what everyone has thought about these plans all along , which is that they would n't have likely worked very well in an emergency and that ... <p> GROSS : Why not ? <p> GRAFF : Well , so one thing is human psychology just makes it - makes these plans challenging in a way that is entirely foreseeable , which is , you have people who - you know , when the Pentagon was struck , Donald Rumsfeld went to that crash site . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounded from the crash site , which was absolutely the right thing for him to do as a leader and as the head of the Defense Department but was exactly the wrong thing for him to do as secretary of defense . You know , he should have been put aboard a helicopter and evacuated to Raven Rock where he would have been safe for continuity of government procedures . <p> And then there 's also this challenge where you can sort of have people safe , or you can have them in communication . And so President Bush , when he was put aboard Air Force One and it was sent up into the sky - well , he was safe , but he was out of touch for the country for that - for most of the key hours of that day . And there was sort of this constant tussle aboard the plane that day between him , who wanted to get back to Washington , wanted to get back to the White House , and the Secret Service and the military who told him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you safe and alive today , and we 're going to keep you in the sky , out of touch . <p> GROSS : People wondered where he was that day . <p> GRAFF : Yeah . And it was a real tension throughout that day . I mean he received a lot of criticism for , you know , not marching right back to the White House , not marching right to Ground Zero . But the - you know , in terms of the presidency , in terms of his role as the commander in chief , he probably made the right decision to listen to the Secret Service , to listen to the military and to ensure his own safety and security that day . <p> GROSS : So how do you know for sure that there 's nothing in between the president 's ability to launch unilaterally a nuclear attack ? Between - there 's nothing between him and doing it . <p> GRAFF : It 's just the way that these procedures have evolved over the years - is to remove any middlemen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so short as it is , you know ? The president might only have eight to 10 to 12 minutes to make a decision about launching a nuclear weapon . There would n't be any time to double-check with someone else . <p> And so we have very carefully crafted a system that ensures that there is nothing that slows down a presidential launch order . But those plans were always predicated upon the idea that the person giving the launch order is the most thoughtful , most intelligent , most sober-minded individual that you could possibly imagine atop the nuclear command and control system . <p> GROSS : How did you manage to write this book without sinking into a complete state of despair ? <p> GRAFF : Well , so some of it is these - there 's a lot of humor in a lot of these plans , you know , sort of unintentional government humor in the way that , you know , sort of strange government decision-making drives some of these plans . You know , sort of one of the silly things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion cash that the Federal Reserve had hidden away in a bunker in Virginia for the nuclear apocalypse . <p> Well , a large portion of that money was actually hidden away in $2 bills because in the 1970s when the government first introduced the $2 bill and discovered that Americans did n't want to use them , well , they did n't want to pulp and waste the money , so they just , you know , shrink-wrapped all the $2 bills and hid them away in a government bunker figuring that after nuclear war , people would n't have that much of a choice about what type of currency they wanted to use anymore . <p> But then it 's also - I think part of what makes these plans so interesting is thinking through how quickly this idea of what you 're going to save for America , what - you know , if you 're trying to preserve and restart the government after an attack , becomes this very existential question about , what is America ? And you know , are you trying to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ? Or are you preserving even the historical totems that have bound us together across generations as Americans ? <p> And so at the National Archives , the National Archives sat down and decided that they would have - in the event of a nuclear attack , they would save the Declaration of Independence before they saved the Constitution .

And then we watch over the course of the Cold War as the weapons get faster . <p> You know , we go from bombers to missiles . And then they get stronger . We go from nuclear bombs , atomic bombs to thermonuclear bombs to hydrogen bombs . And then we also see the arsenals expand . I mean , they go from a few dozen or a few score bombs to the tens of thousands of weapons that we had by the end of the Cold War . <p> And that combination of sort of stronger , faster , more numerous weapons means that the government 's ambitions shrunk over the course of the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is , you know , the civilian population will be left to itself for weeks or months at a time and a small number of senior government officials will be spirited out to these bunkers and with the hope that within months or a few years , they 're able to reconstitute something that resembles the United States again . <p> GROSS : Garrett Graff , thank you so much for talking with us . <p> GRAFF : Oh , it 's been my pleasure . <p> GROSS : Garrett Graff is the author of the new book " Raven Rock : The Story Of The U.S. Government 's Secret Plan To Save Itself -- While The Rest Of Us Die .

@@37206774 @6206774/ <p> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , joined by other Republican senators , meets with reporters following a closed-door strategy session at the Capitol on Tuesday . <p> J. Scott Applewhite / AP <p> Originally published on June 22 , 2017 4:45 pm <p> Updated at 2:32 p.m . ET <p> Senate Republicans unveiled their long-awaited health care overhaul proposal on Thursday . The Senate bill , called the " Better Care Reconciliation Act , " would repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare . The broad outlines of it look a lot like the House bill , the American Health Care Act , which was passed in May . <p> It rolls back the ACA 's Medicaid expansion " making for deep spending cuts to that program , compared with current law . The Senate bill also proposes eliminating many ACA taxes , and the employer penalties associated with the employer and individual mandates would be repealed retroactively , dating to the start of 2016 . And as in the House bill , young adults up to the age of 26 could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Levitt , a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation , summed up his thoughts on the bill Thursday on Twitter : " In broad strokes , the Senate bill is just like the House : Big tax cuts , big cut in federal heath spending , big increase in the uninsured . " <p> As with the House bill , the Senate proposal also allows insurance companies to charge older people five times more than younger people " under the ACA , that ratio is 3 to 1 . That 's just one provision that could hit older Americans hard . <p> A small group of Republican senators has written the bill in secret in recent weeks , with many Americans and even some fellow Republicans eagerly awaiting details about what 's in it . After the bill was released on Thursday , protesters gathered outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 's office . Video from NBC showed police removing some of those protesters from the hallway . <p> Big changes to Medicaid <p> Some of the biggest changes this bill makes are to Medicaid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that sense , it looks like the House bill , which the CBO said would cut Medicaid by $834 billion over a decade ( relative to current law ) , with a loss of 14 million beneficiaries . <p> Both bills roll back a Medicaid expansion undertaken under the Affordable Care Act . That law extended the program to some low-income Americans above the poverty level . The Senate proposal would roll back that expansion , though it would do so more slowly than the House bill proposes . <p> As did the House , the Senate also proposes giving states either a per capita cap on Medicaid spending or a block grant of funds . That 's a fundamental change ; currently the program is " open-ended , " meaning funding increases as need increases . <p> But there 's another change on top of that . Those caps would vary based on the rate of inflation , and the inflation rate the Senate would attach to those caps is one that is lower than the inflation rate the House attached . <p> That might sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one former Medicaid administrator . <p> " That 's a big deal . It 's a big shift , " said John Corlett , president of the Center for Community Solutions , who also served as a director of Ohio 's Medicaid program . " It means billions of dollars less in federal aid to states for their Medicaid programs . " <p> Tax cuts for richer Americans <p> The Senate bill is also much like the House bill in that it would repeal most of the taxes associated with Obamacare ( it would bump out the implementation of the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive , employer-sponsored health care plans , from 2025 to 2026 ) . <p> Repealing those taxes , as the Tax Policy Center reported in May ( regarding the AHCA ) , would overwhelmingly benefit higher-income Americans . The taxes in the Affordable Care Act were largely progressive , as Kyle Pomerleau of the right-leaning Tax Foundation told NPR . <p> To one health policy expert , those tax cuts , combined with the cuts to Medicaid , mean the bill is n't a health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had to find a way to finance it , and Medicaid beneficiaries are going to be the ones who hurt , " said Nicholas Bagley , a University of Michigan Law School professor who specializes in health law . <p> A different tax credit system <p> One other big change this bill could make is creating a new system for who gets premium tax credits , and how big those premiums are . <p> For example , it cuts the upper-income limit that determines who gets premium tax credits . Currently , that upper limit is at 400 percent of the poverty level . This bill would limit that to 350 percent . <p> It also would determine those credits based on age and income " that 's a change from the House bill , which based credits mostly around age . <p> And it would change what people could buy with their tax credits on the health care exchanges . The way the size of those credits is determined would also change , and according to Bagley , it would change in such a way that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The GOP health care plan says , ' Yes , we 're going to make sure you can purchase a plan , but the plans we 're going to make sure you can purchase are going to be very high deductible plans , ' " he said . <p> More similarities with the House plan <p> There are a few other ways the Senate bill mirrors the House bill . It bans the use of any federal funds for any health care plan that covers abortion , except in the cases of rape , incest or where the pregnancy puts the mother 's life in danger . And it also would defund Planned Parenthood for one year . <p> As of 2020 , the bill also eliminates cost-sharing subsidies that help low-income Americans pay for their insurance . <p> And the Senate 's proposal allows states substantial freedom in determining their own health care programs " but it 's even more freedom than the House bill allows for . Under the Affordable Care Act , states can apply for " innovation waivers " exempting them from parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , to an extent . <p> However , there are strict rules in place " what health policy experts call " guardrails " " stating that states getting those waivers must provide coverage that is " at least as comprehensive " as they would otherwise provide , as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explains . <p> The Senate proposal changes those guardrails , saying that states can get those waivers , as long as their alternative plans simply do n't increase the deficit . That allows states to make some big changes if they 'd like " for example , changing the " essential health benefits " that insurers are required to provide under Obamacare.

King Says <p> It is hard to tell if this is two superpowers who are just asserting themselves or if there 's real growing tension between the United States and Russia . This week , Russia said it would not hesitate to target U.S. warplanes over Syria . And we 're trying to figure out what happened this morning . Reports from Russia say NATO fighter jets buzzed a plane that was carrying Russia 's defense minister over the Baltic Sea . All this is happening as the U.S. slapped new sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine . <p> And , oh , yeah , there was that election . Russia 's accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential race . How did they do that ? And will they keep doing it ? Well , those are questions that will be asked today in a Senate intelligence committee hearing . And one person asking the questions will be Senator Angus King , an Independent from Maine , who is with us . And , Senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoey spot in your Senate office building . Is that right ? <p> ANGUS KING : Well , we 're in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building , which is a little bit echoey . But it gives you that kind of feeling of action around here . <p> GREENE : That 's ( laughter ) we like that for radio , as opposed to you just sitting behind your desk I guess . You know , I want to ask you . You used some bold words recently . You said that this attack on the United States election was the most serious in our country since 9/11 . <p> KING : Absolutely , and I think that 's true . I mean , nobody died , but this was a direct attack on our democracy . The intention was to destabilize our democratic system , to cast doubt on it , to undermine it . And ultimately , it looks like their intention was to tip the election one way or the other . And this is the - this is sort of who we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're the most open , free democratic country in the world . The bad news is we 're disproportionately vulnerable to the kind of attack the Russians were pushing in that election . <p> And today 's hearing , David , is particularly important because it 's an aspect of this thing that really has n't gotten much attention . All the drama is about Comey and Trump and who said what and whether there were relationships with - between the Trump campaign and the Russians . But I 'm interested in what the problem is going forward . And today we 're talking about Russian attempts to get into state election systems . And ... <p> GREENE : Well , and I want to ask you , Senator , if I can , before we move on to what , you know ... <p> KING : Sure . <p> GREENE : ... The government might be able to do about this , I was just in Russia and had so many people tell us that this just did n't happen . It is a fabrication from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence community that Russia hacked into the presidential election . But can you tell me here this morning , like , I mean , give me an example of a smoking gun that just makes it abundantly clear of what happened ? <p> KING : Well , I think one of the smoking guns is that this is what the Russians have been doing in Eastern Europe for years . I was over - I was in Poland and the Ukraine last spring . And the first thing their politicians wanted to talk about was , look out for the Russians . They mess around in your elections , and they 're going to try to undermine any Western democracy . They 've tried to - they were involved in the French elections that just took place . So there 's no - number one , it 's what they do . Number two - and I ca n't reveal the intelligence - but there is very good what they call forensic intelligence as to where this attack came from . <p> GREENE : You 've seen smoking guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have seen what you would call a smoking gun . <p> KING : That 's correct . Let me just say , I have no doubt whatsoever that the Russians were behind this . It was sophisticated . It was long-term . And they knew exactly what they were doing - and that they intend to keep doing it . <p> GREENE : Well , you mentioned state election systems . Are we going to begin to get a glimpse of a so-called smoking gun or smoking guns in this hearing today ? I mean , what happened ? How were these state election systems in our country vulnerable ? <p> KING : Well , let me first back up and say why we ca n't talk about some of the smoking guns . And that is the term you use - you hear in the intelligence community is sources and methods . We - if we reveal how we know things , that tips the other side off to shore it up or close it down . Or it might even talk - you know , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . <p> KING : ... That 's why you have to be careful about what you reveal about how you know things . But we do - we - there 's ample evidence of the Russians trying to get into state election systems . And this is one of the aspects that really worries me . I mean , imagine for a moment - and by the way , all the intelligence is that no votes were changed . No tallies were changed . So that should give us a - you know , a sigh of relief . <p> But imagine for a moment if two days after the election , we started to find irregularities around the country , a couple of hundred thousand votes were changed . And - it would have been a true constitutional crisis as to how we decide this kind of thing . So they were trying to do that . And the point I keep making is they were n't doing this for fun . They were practicing . They were getting ready to try to do it again . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , they will be back . <p> GREENE : Well , if that 's true , if they will be back , if you have seen evidence that they were meddling in state election systems , if you believe they might have the capability to actually change vote counts , what is the U.S. government going to do about it ? <p> KING : Well , I think there are three things . One is to do just what we 're doing today and have an open hearing . And by the way , I 'm urging the intelligence community to declassify absolutely as much as they possibly can so the public , and particularly state and local election officials , understand that this is for real . <p> So number one is information - you 're at risk . Number two is to provide guidance , not control - we 're not talking about federal taking over elections but guidance as to how to avoid this . For example , always have a paper backup . Do n't have a voting system that is ever connected online , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the federal government can supply some funds to state and local election systems to change their systems in order to make them more resilient . <p> GREENE : Independent Senator Angus King from the state of Maine , who is going to be taking part in a hearing today specifically focused on Russian meddling in U.S. elections in the past and also potentially in the future . Senator , thanks so much for your time , as always .

Republican leaders have been drafting it in secret . Now they 've released it , and they hope to vote as soon as possible . They 're moving this way because every vote counts . They have none to spare - do n't want debate that would drive votes away . But the secrecy made at least one Republican , Ron Johnson , tell CNN he can not support it without time to read . 190095 @qwx390095 <p> RON JOHNSON : What I 've told leadership , very clearly , is I 'm going to need time and my constituents are going to need time to evaluate exactly how this is going to affect them . So I personally think that holding a vote on this next week would definitely be rushed . I ca n't imagine , quite honestly , that I 'd have the information to evaluate and justify a yes vote within just a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . And we 'll have analysis later this hour and in days to come . A little bit earlier this morning , we spoke with a congressman who voted for the House version of the health care bill , Georgia Republican Congressman Buddy Carter . Welcome back to the program , sir . <p> BUDDY CARTER : Well , thank you . <p> INSKEEP : So we do n't know what the Senate 's going to do . We do know what President Trump has said he wants . He urged a more generous bill than the one you voted for , one with heart , according to the president , and presumably bigger subsidies for people who would have smaller subsidies under your bill . Can you support that ? <p> CARTER : Well , certainly , I will consider it . And certainly , I - we knew all along that there were going to be changes made to it when it went over to the Senate . That 's part of the process . So you know , it really depends on the changes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , it 's not finalized yet . It 's not over here , but I will tell you that I will be looking at it with an open mind . And there is some urgency to this matter . We know that we 've got to do something . I go home so often , and people ask me , are you going to do something ? Are you going to do something ? Well , we 've got to do something . Just look at what happened yesterday in Indiana and Wisconsin when Anthem announced that they were pulling out of the exchange . I mean , this forces us - it forces our hand even more . <p> INSKEEP : You know , I 'm glad you bring this up , Congressman , because there 's been a lot of discussion on our air about the fact that a lot of health insurance companies have pulled out of these state exchanges . Many places have only one insurer to choose from . There 's fear of zero insurers in some places . But as has also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen , for example , a provision sponsored by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that targeted financing to help steady the insurance markets . If it 's a problem that the markets are getting worse , why did you do that ? <p> CARTER : Well , I ca n't speak on behalf of Senator Rubio . I do n't know why he did that . But ... <p> INSKEEP : But it passed both houses of Congress , right ? <p> CARTER : Well , I suspect you 're correct . But the point remains that Obamacare is imploding . Obamacare is failing under its own weight . We know we 've got to do something . The Affordable Care Act has been a failure , and we 've got to get health care back on track here . We 've got to get insurance coverage for these people . Otherwise , we 're going to really be in a mess in this country . <p> INSKEEP : Is it bad enough that a bill has to pass the Senate in the next week , do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that imminent . But at the same time , we need to get our work done . I 'm not sure that , you know , debating this further - and look , we 've been talking about this for the six months that we 've been in session here . And yes , the Senate is just now getting to it . But at the same time , they 've had six months to prepare for this . There 's no excuse for us to beleaguer this and to carry it on even further . <p> INSKEEP : You know , you raised one other thing I want to follow up on , Congressman Carter . You say you want to see what the Senate bill is . You want to see what it looks like . You 're reserving judgment , which is totally fair and also raises a very real point . President Trump says , I want a more generous bill with more generous subsidies . You 're in a position of not wanting to spend too much on health insurance . Could the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak ? <p> CARTER : Well , it certainly could . To me , one of the most important aspects of this is Medicaid reform . We need to make Medicaid better . Medicaid is a safety-net program . It was intended for the aged , the blind , the disabled , for mothers and children . It was not intended for able-bodied adults , and that 's going to be very important to me . <p> INSKEEP : Making sure that the Medicaid expansion is rolled back or that Medicaid is reshaped - that 's important to you ? <p> CARTER : Exactly - and to make it even better because when we roll it back and we make it truly for those who do need it , then it 'll be a much better program .

Who is covered by the executive order ? <p> The order suspended new refugee admissions for 120 days . It capped the total number of refugees allowed into the country this year at 50,000 , far lower than the Obama administration had allotted . And travelers from seven countries " Iraq , Iran , Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred for 90 days . Border Patrol agents and lawyers said the order and statements by top White House officials have not made clear how Green Card holders , or lawful permanent residents , are to be treated . <h> 2 . What have the federal courts ruled so far ? <p> The American Civil Liberties Union sued in Brooklyn over the detention of two Iraqi clients at John F. Kennedy International Airport . Late Saturday , Judge Ann Donnelly issued a temporary restraining order barring the deportation of as many as 200 people . Judge Donnelly cited " irreparable harm " they would face , and she demanded that the Trump administration provide a list of all affected refugees and travelers . Later , a federal judge in suburban Virginia ordered that travelers be allowed to consult with volunteer attorneys . And another judge in Massachusetts ruled the travelers not only were free from deportation , but that those being held must be released from federal detention . There are reports from pro bono lawyers that border agents may not be complying with some of those directives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration saying about this ? <p> White House officials said the policy is designed to protect U.S. borders and to restrict the entry of terrorism suspects . The Department of Homeland Security said fewer than 1 percent of the average 325,000 people who journeyed to the U.S. on Saturday were " inconvenienced . " DHS said the president 's order security or public safety . " <p> On NBC 's Meet The Press on Sunday , White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Green Card holders would not be affected " moving forward , " but he went on to say that they would " be subjected to further screening " at the border . <h> 4 . Where do the legal challenges go from here ? <p> The president has sweeping authority on matters of immigration . Federal law allows the president to suspend people or classes of people if he determines their entry is " detrimental " to the nation . But a 1965 update to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people should not experience preferences or discrimination on account of their " race , sex , nationality , place of birth or place of residence . " <p> Trump 's order appears to grant some religious preference to Christians and to target seven majority-Muslim countries , though his order points out that people from those countries had already been singled out for extra vetting during the Obama years . <p> Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union , immigrants rights groups and other advocates are likely to file more lawsuits in the coming days on the grounds that the order violates the 1965 immigration law , the right to due process , and the First Amendment clause that bars Congress from establishing a religion , among other things . <p> White House officials insisted they did not set out to create a " Muslim ban . " But Trump associate Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump had reached out to him and others about how to make such a ban , which Trump proposed on the campaign trail in December 2015 , legal . And the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban , " as well . Those statements could be used by refugee advocates to demonstrate the administration 's intent . <h> 5 . What happens with Trump 's nominees for key Cabinet posts ? <p> Democrats argue that key offices within the State Department and the Justice Department were in the dark about the immigration order before it was made public . They want to know if Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions , the nominee to be attorney general , advised Trump on the order " and whether Sessions will commit to making sure Justice Department lawyers are consulted in the future . The Senate Judiciary Committee is supposed to vote on Sessions ' nomination on Tuesday . If he passes that vote , Sessions could be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week . 190096 @qwx390096 <p> RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : <p> We are in the midst of an epic few days of the American story .

But that 's just people who were in transit or already in the United States , right ? The president has the right to keep out other people if he chooses to do that . <p> JOHNSON : He does . The president has broad legal authority in this regard . Two other judges , though , did something slightly different . A judge in Virginia ordered travelers a green card holders be allowed to consult with attorneys . Another in Massachusetts ruled that folks were not only free from deportation who had been stuck in the airport but they need to be released . <p> Steve , there are reports from pro-bono lawyers all weekend that border agents may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , which is a problem . <p> INSKEEP : Is that clear that they are or are n't ? And is the administration openly defying the courts ? <p> JOHNSON : We do n't know for sure . We 've heard from ACLU lawyers , other advocates for immigrants that there 's evidence . They 're being kept from talking with attorneys about the situation . It is mysterious at this point , and some Democrats in Congress are demanding a meeting with DHS . <p> INSKEEP : OK . So we 'll keep looking for answers as we can get them . <p> What is the president saying about all this , Carrie ? <p> JOHNSON : Well , after a torrent of criticism all weekend , President Trump finally weighed in with a statement . He says it 's all about protecting American borders and keeping the country safe . Homeland Security says only a small percentage of the average number of people who journeyed to the U.S. this weekend were - in its words - inconvenienced . And the DHS says no matter what these judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and the U.S. government can revoke visas at any time . <p> INSKEEP : What happens to all the legal challenges now , given that the order , broadly - with some exceptions - is in place ? <p> JOHNSON : Well , Steve , the White House says the president has sweeping authority on immigration and at the border . There is a federal law that allows the president to suspend people if he determined their entry is detrimental to the nation . But there are also laws that conflict a little bit . There 's a 1965 law on the books that says people should not experience preferences or discrimination on the basis of race , sex , nationality when it comes to immigration . And Trump 's order appears to grant some religious preference to Christians , which could be a target of lawsuits moving forward , including one , I 'm hearing , by the Council on American-Islamic Relations , which could be coming very soon . <p> INSKEEP : Are you referring to the provision that says persecuted religious minorities can still get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day - yeah , I meant Christians by that - maybe not exclusively , but that 's what he was talking about . <p> JOHNSON : Yeah . And , you know , opponents of this order seem to suggest that this is a disguised way , a clever way by the administration to impose what they call a Muslim ban . Now , Donald Trump says this is not a Muslim ban . But Trump 's close associate Rudy Giuliani told Fox News over the weekend that Donald Trump reached out to him and others about how to make such a ban legal and give it legal cover . <p> Steve , those statements could be used by refugee advocates to demonstrate some discriminatory intent by the administration in lawsuits going forward . 
@@37206779 @6206779/ <h> Spillover Beasts : Which Animals Pose The Biggest Viral Risk ? <p> Bats are among the animals carrying viruses that have not yet infected humans but have potential for spillover " particularly in South and Central American and parts of Asia . On the color scale on this map and the two maps below , the warmer colors represent a greater risk of viruses jumping into people and green shades show a lower risk . <p> Hotspots for primates are in the tropics , including large parts of Central Africa and Southeast Asia . <p> Courtesy of EcoHealth Alliance <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> Originally published on June 22 , 2017 10:18 am <p> Eye-popping . That 's the word that comes to mind when you hear how many viruses are likely hiding out around the world in animals . <p> " We expect there are hundreds of thousands of mammalian viruses out there , " says Kevin Olival , a disease ecologist at EcoHealth Alliance , who led the study . <p> Really ? Hundreds of thousands ? <p> " Yes , it 's likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to have 20 , 30 or even 100 viruses . When you add that up around the planet , you get a big number . " <p> A really big number . <p> The good news is that not all those viruses can infect humans . We have only detected a fraction of them . And only a tiny , tiny fraction are likely ever to be a public health problem . <p> So how do you know which ones are harmless and which ones we should be concerned about ? <p> Olival and his colleagues have taken a few steps to start answering that question . <p> In the journal Nature , the team offers the most comprehensive view to date of where viruses are hiding around the globe and which species are most likely harbor risky ones . <p> The study , published Wednesday , also estimates how many " missing " viruses are out there in the world " viruses that we know are in animals and can possibly jump into people , only we have n't detected them yet . <p> To do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a list of all known viruses in mammals on Earth . They ended up with nearly 600 unique viruses found in about 750 species . <p> About a third of the viruses had the ability to jump from mammals into people . These are called zoonotic viruses . Bats , primates and rodents carry the largest proportions of zoonotic viruses , the study found , with bats edging out primates for the No. 1 slot . <p> The researchers found two factors that likely boost the chance an animal transmits a virus to people : how closely related the animal is to humans and how much time that animal spends in urban areas . <p> " So we think our closest relatives , such as chimpanzees , are going to be higher risks , " Olival says , " And so will animals that come into contact with people often . " <p> They also found that the more promiscuous the virus " that is , the more species it can infect " the more likely it is to end up in people . <p> Olival and his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoonotic viruses are likely hiding . <p> " Most of them are in the tropics , " Olival says . For instance , bat viruses are concentrated primarily in South America , where there 's a high diversity of bat species . Primate viruses are mostly in central Africa and patches of Southeast Asia . <p> And here in the U.S. , it 's all about the rodents . " North America is not exempt from zoonotic viruses , " Olival says , " although sometimes we like to think so . " <p> Specifically the researchers predict there 's a high-risk zone of rodent viruses on around the Rocky Mountains . And this finding actually matches up with results from a study back in 2015 , which predicted a hot spot for rodent viruses in Nebraska and Kansas . <p> So what does this mean for people living in the middle of the country ? Should they stay away from rodents ? <p> " I would n't go snuggle up with a rodent . But I would n't be afraid , " says Barbara Han , a disease ecologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rodent viruses . <p> Because , she says , we 're still far from predicting whether a particular animal virus is dangerous for people . <p> Most of these " missing " viruses have likely been circulating in the animals for centuries , even thousands of years , and not causing any problem . <p> But communities should keep these virus hot spots in mind when they make plans to expand , Han says . <p> " For example , if we 're interested in tearing up a bunch of pristine habitat in the Midwest , we should just know that there are a lot of rodent species there , " she says . " If you put a bunch of humans into that habit , then , of course , you 're going to get disease spillover . " <p> Even when the risk of an outbreak is low , the consequences can be huge if it does happen " just as we learned with Ebola in 2014. 190096 @qwx390096 <p> KELLY MCEVERS , HOST : <p> This next story is about where certain viruses are hiding around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about how many might be out there . NPR 's Michaeleen Doucleff says the number is surprising . <p> MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF , BYLINE : Here 's a question for you . Where do new human viruses come from like Ebola and Zika ? Kevin Olival at EcoHealth Alliance says the answer is surprisingly simple . <p> KEVIN OLIVAL : Most of these come from wild mammals . <p> DOUCLEFF : Wild mammals - that includes exotic creatures like chimpanzees in Cameroon but also just your run-of-the-mill rodents in the Midwest . Olival and his colleagues studied the ecology of diseases , and for the past decade , they have been trying to figure out how many viruses are hiding in animals worldwide . They 've scoured studies and analyzed databases and then added them all up . <p> OLIVAL : We 're talking about almost 600 viruses . So 586 unique viruses are in the dataset and about under 800 mammal species roughly . <p> DOUCLEFF : Six-hundred viruses sounds like a lot , but here 's the thing . That 's just the viruses that we know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further . <p> OLIVAL : We predict how many more viruses are out there on the planet and where should we go to look for those . <p> DOUCLEFF : Olival and his team published the results in the journal Nature . They estimate that most of these viruses are in the tropics . For instance , bat viruses are concentrated in the Amazon , and monkey viruses are primarily in Central Africa and Southeast Asia . But the U.S. is n't exempt . <p> OLIVAL : For rodent viruses , there 's actually some sort of hotspots within the U.S. <p> DOUCLEFF : Specifically , the researchers predict there 's a bunch of rodent viruses on the western side of the Rocky Mountains . And this finding actually matches up with results from another study which found a hotspot for rodent viruses in the Midwest in Nebraska and Kansas . <p> OK , before you hop up and buy a bunch of hand sanitizer or get angry at that squirrel outside your window , Barbara Han , a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute , says there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I mean I would n't go snuggle up with a rodent ( laughter ) , but I would n't be afraid . <p> DOUCLEFF : Because , she says , these viruses have likely been hanging out in Midwestern mice and voles for many , many years , causing no problems at all . How many of these viruses do we really need to worry about ? <p> HAN : So that is the golden question , right ? I mean we want to know not just how many were missing and we do n't know about , but we want to know the ones that are going to be a problem , the ones that are posing the risk to humans . <p> DOUCLEFF : To do that , we have to do more than just map out where viruses are . We have to actually figure out what makes that Ebola virus decide one day it 's going to jump from a gorilla into a person . Michaeleen Doucleff , NPR News .

@@37206781 @6206781/ <h> Psychiatrist Recalls ' Heartbreak And Hope ' On Bellevue 's Prison Ward <p> The inmates in Bellevue are awaiting trial for a variety of offenses , ranging from sleeping on the subway to murder . <p> Spencer Platt / Getty Images <p> Listen 190097 @qwx390097 <p> / <p> Originally published on April 28 , 2017 4:30 pm <p> When mentally i 'll inmates in New York City 's Rikers Island jail become too sick , violent , delusional or suicidal for the jail to handle , they 're sent to Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward for treatment . <p> The inmates in Bellevue are awaiting trial for a variety of offenses , ranging from sleeping on the subway to murder . But for Dr. Elizabeth Ford , a psychiatrist who treats them , the charges against her patients are secondary . <p> " My job is to try to look past that and ... to care for them , to be curious about them and to be non-judgmental , " she says . " It is ... a daily struggle , but one that I have found over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates at Bellevue in 2000 during an internship and eventually worked her way up to become director of the hospital 's forensic psychiatric service . She revisits her experiences treating Rikers ' inmates in her new memoir , Sometimes Amazing Things Happen . <p> " The type of symptoms and pathology that I saw and took care of during my time at Bellevue really shocked me , " Ford says . " Of the patients I took care of , it was almost a universal experience that they have suffered abuse or significant neglect as children . I literally ca n't remember a patient for whom that did n't apply . " <p> Interview Highlights <p> On hearing difficult and disturbing stories from patients <p> A patient talked in a group , for the first time really , about how his drinking behavior started when he was 8 years old , because he accidentally learned that if he drank when his father whipped him it did n't hurt as much . And that 's where his alcohol problem started . So stories like that are really heartbreaking and gut-wrenching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come to almost expect that every patient I take care of has some real abuse history . ... <p> I took care of many patients who had been accused of killing somebody . The most difficult ones for me were those who had been accused of killing a child , and that became particularly hard for me after I became pregnant and had my two children . But to listen to them talk " not necessarily about the crime , but about the feelings behind what led up to that , how they felt afterwards , and then the whole developmental trajectory that ... made it seem like it was inevitable it was going to happen " was very difficult . <p> On how many of her patients are neurodevelopmentally delayed <p> Increasingly I am noticing , in ways that I think I did n't appreciate early in my career , the numbers of people who are incarcerated who are neurodevelopmentally delayed and who do n't have the education , or do n't have the cognitive ability , to really navigate through this system . <p> The first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every patient , regardless of what 's going on with them " is to sit , and be with them , and listen . And sometimes for patients , particularly who are neurodevelopmentally delayed , literally just being there for them , not running away , is the best thing that I can do . And then , when they settle , we can talk about how best to move forward . <p> On how to handle violent patients <p> Much of the violence was a result of patients feeling like they were n't having their needs met ; they were n't being heard . Occasionally it had to do with their criminal-justice case , but there was a wide range of managing it , and we tried as best we could to start with the least forceful intervention . So talking to a patient , trying to understand " and if that did n't work , offering them medication , if that was appropriate . ... <p> Sometimes patients had to be locked in rooms " it 's called seclusion " to keep themselves and others safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were so extraordinarily violent that there was nothing else we could do , they did have to be restrained , which is not something any of us ever wanted to do , but sometimes happened . Over the course of my career I have definitely found that the first approach " listening to patients and really having patience with them " is by far the best approach . When patients are scared , they become violent . And if you can listen to them , the fear goes away . <p> On group therapy <p> One of the amazing things ... is that patients would come in and expect ' show any weakness and you 'll be taken advantage of , ' or ' share anything about your life and something bad will happen , ' and I think what patients found , certainly what I found over the years , is that that was not always the case . In some instances you could find support where you did n't really expect it . ... <p> One of the biggest stressors of being in jail is that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with . You have officers telling you things that you need to be doing that you may not agree with , and you have health staff who sometimes are asking you to do things you do n't want to do . But you 're in an absolutely new community , and group therapy is a perfect petri dish to practice interacting and communicating with people that you do n't know , some of whom you might be afraid of , some of whom you do n't respect . ... I have found group therapy to be some of the best treatment in this kind of setting . <p> On her new job as chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City <p> We 've developed a model where patients are much safer . They take their medication much more frequently . Injury rates are down . And the officers and the health staff work very closely together . There 's a very team-based approach to these units , and patients do well " as well as one can do in a jail setting . But patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for hospitalization , and I think those things are a testament to what can be done , even in a setting that , I think , many people feel is hopeless . I do n't see it that way . ... <p> There are ways for jails and prisons to be more rehabilitative and I think we can be all starting a conversation about that . The issue of punishment certainly comes up . From my perspective as a doctor I have found that positive reinforcement " that means praising someone or helping someone when they do good things , rather than punishing when they do bad things " is the best way to change behavior . So , I think the more that we can try to incorporate that into the mission of the work we do in the jails , the better . <p> This is FRESH AIR . I 'm Terry Gross . When mentally i 'll inmates in New York City 's Rikers Island jail become too sick , too violent , delusional or suicidal for the jail to handle , they 're sent for treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist Elizabeth Ford , treated them . She started working with inmates in 2000 during her internship at Bellevue and continued to treat them as a psychiatrist , eventually becoming director of Bellevue 's forensic psychiatric service . <p> In her new memoir , " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen , " she writes about her experiences treating Rikers inmates and how it 's affected her to hear their stories of horrible things they 've done and the horrible things that have been done to them . She 's now trying to improve mental health conditions at Rikers in her position as chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . <p> Rikers encompasses 14 separate jails spread across New York 's five boroughs but the hub - nine of those jails - are on a 415-acre island in Flushing Bay , a hundred yards west of LaGuardia Airport . Rikers is a jail , not a prison . Most of the inmates are serving short sentences or waiting to be arraigned . But the court system is so overwhelmed that the wait can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Ford , welcome to FRESH AIR . So let 's talk about some of the typical problems , if there is such a thing as typical problems , that you 've seen in the mentally i 'll inmates at Rikers . I mean , obviously some people there have paranoia and are delusional . I mean , you write about one person who heard voices telling them to amputate a limb to save their souls . Did they succeed in doing that ? <p> ELIZABETH FORD : Thankfully , no . The focus of the book really are on those patients who are so sick that they need to be hospitalized . And so the bulk of the time that I spend with them , at least throughout this time period , is when they 're in the hospital at Bellevue . And they are in that hospital because they are the most sick of the men who are incarcerated in this system . And the type of symptoms and pathology that that I saw and took care of during my time there really shocked me . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these patients , they had never received treatment before . They had never talked to anybody about the things that they were experiencing in their head . And I would say that the jail setting in and of itself can really drive the exacerbation of symptoms . <p> So people can become quite desperate , whether they 're mentally i 'll or not , in this kind of setting . And I - you mentioned the wanting to cut off a limb . There 's a huge range of self-injury , so trying to hurt oneself in various ways that we would not consider - swallowing detergent packets or slicing into your abdomen with a shank . I mean , these are things that are horribly disturbing and certainly to hear about but for the patients enormously disturbing . <p> GROSS : Some of the inmates who you treated had developmental problems . And so you write about a patient with an IQ of 58 who banged his head against the wall because he did n't know a better way to calm himself . <p> FORD : Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as the psychiatrist ? <p> FORD : Yeah . So increasingly I am noticing in ways that I think I did n't appreciate early in my career the numbers of people who are incarcerated who are neurodevelopmentally delayed and who do n't have the education or do n't have the cognitive ability to really navigate through this system . <p> And you 're absolutely right , I do write about that particular patient , although he was an amalgam of many patients who will self-soothe in ways that are very harmful , so banging one 's head or cutting oneself or punching a wall or sometimes screaming , behaviors that will - if you do n't know what 's going on can scare the staff members and can scare other patients . <p> So I - so what do you do about that as a psychiatrist ? I mean , I - the first thing I do , which is what I try to do for every patient regardless of what 's going on with them , is to sit and be with them and listen . And sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being there for them . Not running away is the best thing that I can do . And then when they settle , we can talk about how best to move forward . <p> GROSS : Now , some of the patients who you treated were also violent , so they posed difficulties for the guards , for fellow inmates , possibly for you . Was there a separate way of dealing with violent patients ? <p> FORD : Well , I think that that 's a good question . There were different approaches to dealing with the violence that happened on those units . Much of the violence was a result of patients feeling like they were n't having their needs met or they were n't being heard . And occasionally , it had to do with their criminal justice case . But there was a wide range of managing it . And we tried as best we could to start with the least forceful intervention , so talking to a patient , trying to understand . <p> And if that did n't work , offering them medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there was a psychiatric reason there . Sometimes patients had to be locked in rooms - it 's called seclusion - to keep themselves and others safe . And just like any other psychiatric hospital , for patients who were so extraordinarily violent that there was nothing else we could do , they did have to be restrained , which is not something that any of us ever wanted to do but sometimes happened . <p> I think over the course of my career , I have definitely found that the first approach , listening to patients and really having patience with them is by far the best approach . They - when patients are scared , they become violent . And if you can listen to them , the fear goes away . <p> GROSS : Well , I imagine people trusted you with some really awful stories about what they did and what had been done to them . Would you share one of those stories with us that you were told that you found very upsetting about what the person you were trying to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That - and that has been for me , I think , the most difficult challenge of this work is to be able to hear stories about my patients , not just about what they may or may not have done but what happened to them and to hold that for them and to be as objective and non-judgmental as I can as a doctor for them . <p> But so I had - many of the patients I took care of who were accused of sort of high-profile crimes I actually did not include in the book because I wanted to respect their confidentiality . But , I mean , I took care of many patients who had been accused of killing somebody . The most difficult ones for me were those who had been accused of killing a child . And that became particularly hard for me after I became pregnant and had my two children . <p> But to listen to them talk not necessarily about the crime but about sort of the feelings behind what led up to that , how they felt afterwards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made it seem like it was inevitable what was going to happen . It was very difficult but I think the - so the hardest for me have been accused or charges that relate to child abuse and child murder . <p> GROSS : Well , you write about one person who is a child pornographer . And you describe how you had to basically count in your mind and , like , disassociate yourself from what you were hearing because it was just , like , too upsetting to listen to . So how do you go about treating somebody whose confession to you was so upsetting , you know , that you had to dissociate ? Yeah . <p> FORD : Yeah . So - it 's - and that 's - that story that you recount was right in the middle of my own personal development as a psychiatrist in trying to learn how to hear this kind of information and not over empathize and not be disgusted . So I - the story that you describe , the counting and the dissociation , certainly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to work through in my own therapy and , frankly , also take a break from the work and try to figure out what it was about the - what the patients were telling me and confiding in me that bothered me so much . <p> And I think the best answer I can tell you is that I got great treatment . And I found some ways to help myself pull back and distance from some of this very intimate and disturbing information and move on . It has also been very helpful for me to always think in the back of my mind , what is going on with this individual that this is the kind of behavior they feel compelled to do or they ca n't control ? <p> GROSS : Well , you know , there 's that conflict that you write about in the book of somebody being in Rikers to be punished , although really mostly they 're awaiting trial . So it 's like punishment versus treatment . It 's like your job is to treat them but they 're there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FORD : It is true , I have chosen a profession as a doctor in a place where my patients are being punished . Now , many of them ... <p> GROSS : Many of them are being punished because they had a joint or something . And , you know , especially in your earlier years there before the drug laws were liberalized , a lot of people were there - minor possession charges . <p> FORD : Yes , that 's true . And thankfully , those have shifted over time . But yeah , many were in on what I call - well , some minor drug charges but also quality of life charges like sleeping on the subway or sleeping in a - sort of a park that was private . And some of them had a dollar bail , so $1 was keeping them in this - in the jail system . <p> And I have - I mean , my job is to try to look past that and see these patients as my patients , to care for them , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I will say , it is a daily struggle but one I 've found over the years , like , incredibly rewarding . I do think though that 's the challenge for being a correctional psychiatrist . <p> GROSS : So you never feel like you are so - what you 've done is so horrible . I do n't even want to treat you . I do n't want to know you . You should just be , like , locked up behind a closed door and never let out . Do you know what I 'm saying ? <p> FORD : I know - of course , I know exactly what you 're saying because I 've actually felt that about a patient . There was one patient I do - I write about him a little bit in the book for whom I had no empathy , at least I thought I had no empathy . And he had taxed the staff . He was not - he was not stable in either the jail or the hospital . He was very provocative and aggressive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable and sick . <p> And there was a point where I just thought , I actually do n't really care what happens to you . And it was at that moment , literally that night , I was in tears talking to my husband about sort of what had shifted in me ? How could I be feeling this way about someone ? And that did end up sending me down a path where I took a break from the work to try to get a sense of it . But yeah , I can understand that feeling . <p> GROSS : What had that person done ? <p> FORD : He had killed a stranger - allegedly . So he was - he was also not convicted . <p> GROSS : Well , I wanted to talk to you more about your work . I want to talk to you more about being pregnant while you were working . But first , we have to take a short break . If you 're just joining us , my guest is Dr. Elizabeth Ford , a psychiatrist who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rikers Island . <p> Since 2014 , she has been the chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . Her new memoir about her work at Bellevue is called " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen . This is FRESH AIR . Let 's get back to my interview with psychiatrist Elizabeth Ford . Her memoir , " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen , " is about her work at Bellevue 's prison ward treating inmates from Rikers Island . She 's now chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . <p> So you talk about being horrified by some of the actions your patients committed but you also write about being horrified at what was done to your patients when they were children . And it seems that most of the time when somebody was mentally i 'll and had done horrible things , you could pretty well bet that they had been punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> FORD : So of the patients that I took care of , it was almost a universal experience that they had suffered abuse or significant neglect as children . I literally ca n't remember a patient for whom that did n't apply . And sometimes , yes , they were absolutely awful stories . <p> A patient talked in a group for the first time , really , about his drinking behavior that started when he was 8 years old because he accidentally learned that if he drank when his father whipped him , it did n't hurt as much . And that 's where his alcohol problem started . So stories like that are really heartbreaking and gut-wrenching . And so I - you know , I really - I struggle with hearing those but I have come to almost expect that every patient I take care of has some real abuse history . <p> GROSS : So that story you just told about the patient who drank when he was their child because the whippings hurt less if he was drinking and he had drunk his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you learn this at a group therapy session . And it 's really hard at that session to get anyone to actually talk . And why would they ? Like , why ? Group therapy just seems , like , so difficult to me in a prison kind of setting . <p> And , you know , Bellevue 's ward where you work was basically an extension of Rikers Island jail . So , like , you 're talking with fellow inmates . Everybody 's , of course , like paranoid in prison . You do n't know who 's going to hurt you when you 're in prison . So how did you get people to speak openly in a group therapy session when they 're going back to Rikers after leaving Bellevue ? Oh , and then you do n't want to look weak . <p> FORD : Right . <p> GROSS : Like , if you confess to any kind of weakness and word gets out , like you 're done . <p> FORD : Well , I think that that 's a little bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amazing things really related to the title is that there - patients would come in and expect just , as you describe , that show any weakness and you 'll be taken advantage of or share anything about your life and something bad will happen . <p> And I think what patients found , certainly what I found over the years , is that that was not always the case . And in some instances you could find support where you did n't really expect it . Related to the group therapy , though - because I think that 's an extraordinarily important topic to focus on - one of the biggest stressors of being in jail is that you are surrounded by people who you have not chosen to live with . You have officers telling you things that you need to be doing that you may not agree with and you have staff - health staff - who sometimes are asking you to do things you do n't want to do . <p> But you 're in a new - an absolutely new community , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communicating with people that you do n't know and some of whom you might be afraid of or some of whom you do n't respect . And so I started that group that you were referring to specifically to address that issue . Like , how can we collectively as a community - that includes the patients and the staff and sometimes even the officers - how can we survive this system and come out the other side hopefully less damaged than when we came in ? I have found group therapy to be some of the best treatment in this kind of setting . <p> GROSS : That 's really interesting . So you were dealing often with patients who were - who posed a threat to themselves or to others . How frequently were you threatened by your patients ? <p> FORD : Actually , not very often . There are a handful of times I can remember where I was scared , and it was not necessarily from a threat - a direct threat from the patient , but where I was afraid that something might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so overwhelming that I was very scared . <p> My response to that is typically to let the patients know that I 'm afraid . And I sometimes wonder if that 's my own style or if that has to do somehow with me being a woman . But when I let the patients know that I am afraid or that their behavior is making me uncomfortable , it almost cuts the scene right at that point . And we reset and start over . And so the handful of times that I have really felt scared , as long as I can stay with the patient and let them know , things have gotten better . <p> GROSS : How do you tell a patient that they 're starting to scare you ? <p> FORD : Very simply . I say I 'm starting to get scared right now . Literally that 's what I say , sometimes depending on the relationship , I will say I wonder if you 're also feeling a little bit scared , but that usually does n't happen until I 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't upset them further . <p> GROSS : My guest is psychiatrist Elizabeth Ford . Her new memoir " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen " is about her work at Bellevue Hospital in New York treating severely mentally i 'll patients who were sent to Bellevue from Rikers Island jail . After a break , we 'll talk about one of the patients who threatened I 'm Terry Gross . Let 's get back to my interview with Elizabeth Ford , a psychiatrist who worked at Bellevue Hospital in New York treating patients who were inmates sent from Rikers Island jail . She became director of Bellevue 's forensic psychiatric service . Now she 's trying to improve mental health conditions at Rikers in her position as chief of Psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . In her new memoir " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen " about her work at Bellevue , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , but she felt threatened by some of them . <p> You tell one story about when you were pregnant and the patient you were talking to said - you were standing , and the patient you were talking to you said you should sit down . Why do n't you tell the story , instead of me telling it ? <p> FORD : ( Laughter ) Yeah . This was a very i 'll patient who had schizophrenia . And I was very pregnant - that 's correct - and was interviewing him to see if we needed to go to the judge to ask him to force medication on this patient because he was not taking his medicine . And we knew from prior hospitalizations that if he took his medicine , he would get well enough that we could actually start talking about some of the deeper issues . <p> So I was providing what 's called a second opinion to see if I agreed with his doctor who wanted to present the case to the judge . So as - and as we were talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I had these - my ankles were very swollen and I was generally uncomfortable . I sort of sat in the back of this room with an attorney and a social worker . And he did very quickly - without much warning , this patient got up and threw a plastic chair in my direction . <p> It was n't a particularly heavy chair but he threw it with some force , did n't hit anybody . Everyone scurried out of the room . And I was trying to be brave . There 's no question there , I was scared but trying to be the leader , trying to be the person who was going to figure out what to do next and just sort of quietly walked out of the room , went to talk to the patient in his room to find out what was going on . <p> And he initially did n't say much when we got him back into the room to continue the discussion . He said to me no pregnant lady should stand . I was offering you a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be angry at this man who was trying his best to be kind and compassionate to me ? Now , it came out in a way that was violent and potentially quite dangerous , but that was n't the intent . <p> GROSS : So you were able to put that aside , the fact that he threw a chair at you and then continue to treat him ? <p> FORD : I - well , I was n't actually his treating doctor , so I was the second opinion doctor . But yes , I think I was - I do n't think that I saw him in a different light after that . I was much more cautious about my own pregnancy after that situation , though . I did n't quite realize how much a pregnant woman could inspire all sorts of feelings and behaviors in the patients . <p> GROSS : Is there another example of somebody behaving totally inappropriately in respect to your pregnancy ? <p> FORD : Well , inappropriately is a tough word for me to define because I do try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the behaviors . I had a number of patients who would talk to me about the fate of my unborn children . I was - I actually was pregnant twice over the course of a couple years on that unit . <p> And I think probably that would be considered inappropriate if you were talking to a friend and they were describing awful things that might happen to your child when they were born . I think that 's probably inappropriate . As they were describing these to me , though , I was getting a window into some of the feelings that they have - that they potentially had about their own childhood , about their own mothers . <p> There was a lot of discussion about what it meant that I might care for my child more than I care for my patient . What was it going to mean that I was going to be out on maternity leave and abandoning these patients ? So there was - the pregnancy brought up a lot of issues . <p> GROSS : What did they tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , baby ? <p> FORD : One patient told me that - well , actually he told me that he knew what the name of the child was going to be and that the child was going to be cursed . And that while I was a good doctor , I was not going to be a good mother . <p> I had other patients who would tell me you 're going to be a great mom and good luck . But I think there was - the primary message was one more of kind of jealousy , maybe fear that I would leave them . It was hard ( laughter ) . <p> GROSS : A lot of people when they 're pregnant try to , like , have soothing music in the background so that the baby in utero will have this kind of , like , warm environment that they 're kind of sensing and everything . And you are exposing , like , you know , your baby in utero to people telling you that your baby 's going to be cursed . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just giving you the most horrible stories about their lives , about acts that they committed , about things that were done to them as as a child . Did you fear that you were exposing your baby in utero to horrible things ? I mean , was that ever in the back of your mind ? And I 'm not saying that that would necessarily be a problem but , you know , people - you worry about things . <p> FORD : Yeah . Well , I think I can only speak for me as a mother but I suspect that probably most pregnant women worry about what 's happening to their baby as it 's growing inside of them . And they worry about all sorts of environmental concerns and their own mental health , their physical health and how that 's impacting the baby . <p> So sure , I , of course , worried about that . It was n't - my work is so much a part of what I do . And taking care of these patients was sort of in my core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end when that patient threw the chair at me I might be putting my child at risk , so I do n't know . <p> And I - my children now are healthy and happy but I do n't know if I 'll find out the effects of that kind of work until they 're older . And I hope that they can appreciate and understand how passionately their mom feels about the work that she does and how hard she tries to help these patients . And so that 's what I hope they 've gotten out of the experience . <p> GROSS : Well , why do n't we take a short break here and then we 'll talk some more . If you 're just joining us , my guest is Dr. Elizabeth Ford . She 's a psychiatrist who worked at Bellevue 's prison ward where she treated inmates from Rikers Island . <p> Since 2014 , she 's been the chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . She has a new memoir called " Sometimes Amazing @ @ @ This is FRESH AIR . Let 's get back to my interview with psychiatrist Elizabeth Ford . Her new memoir , " Sometimes Amazing Things Happen , " is about her work at Bellevue 's prison ward treating inmates from Rikers Island . She 's now chief of psychiatry for correctional health services for New York City 's public health system . <p> Earlier in your career , you went through at least one period of just being shaken . You write that you asked your husband to clip things out of the newspaper that might upset you so you would n't see them . One night , you woke up screaming in terror . What was happening in that period ? <p> FORD : So as a psychiatrist , looking back on it I think I was developing symptoms of traumatic stress disorder , really . I mean , in the moment , I did n't know what was happening . I was not sleeping . I was so scared for my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I - my appetite was gone . And I was having a harder and harder time hearing the stories about my patients . <p> So I think I was developing symptoms . I was fortunate enough that my husband really stayed on me and insisted that I take it seriously . And I got into - I have - as a psychiatrist , I think it 's important that you are engaged in your own therapy . So I - and I escalated that treatment a little bit . But it - so it was very hard . That 's the darkest period of my career , for sure . <p> I mean , I do tend to be someone who tries to see things - see the bright side of things . And I have - in some ways I am - I - it 's going to sound odd too but maybe grateful for the experience because I have a glimmer into what some of my patients experience now and how they feel . And to know a little bit about that fear and that just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope , of some of the things that they 're going through . <p> GROSS : Did you think of giving up your career working with inmates as you were ... <p> FORD : Oh , definitely . Yeah . <p> GROSS : How come you did n't ? How come you stuck with it ? <p> FORD : So I actually did n't stick with it for - I did leave . I left for about 18 months , although my leaving ended up being working in the emergency room for three days a week , where I still ended up seeing these patients . <p> GROSS : At Bellevue ? <p> FORD : Yeah , at Bellevue . But what I what I found was that in spite of my initial desire to just be gone and not deal with all of these challenges , I was really drawn to these patients . And in the emergency room , I would see patients who had been arrested and were coming in to be evaluated . <p> And I just was so compelled by the stories they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the idea of feeling hopeful about them , God , it was very hard to resist . It was very hard . I missed it . I really missed it . And when I was given - I was very thankful to have been given the opportunity to return to the psychiatric forensic service and be its director in 2009 and ... <p> GROSS : At Bellevue ? <p> FORD : Yeah , at Bellevue . And that also - that helped me to , I think , realize some of the some of the ideas and the vision that I had had earlier in my work that I might not have been able to accomplish had I not been in a leadership role . <p> GROSS : So stepping back , what do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions that people have about jails in the U.S. and what we need to do in terms of how to keep people in there , the extent that - to which they should be punished while they 're in jail , you know , how punitive the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of being a doctor in this system , so I really try very hard to think about how can the health of people who happen to be in the jail system be improved ? I am not responsible for the why people get into the jail system . And I know there are many strong opinions about that and how jails should operate . I try very hard to focus on the patients and how to treat their mental illness the more I get into this work , also just how to treat the mental health of everybody who works in a jail system . <p> I think there are some significant misconceptions , though . I think about people who choose to work in jails and also the people who get incarcerated . Jail is a tough place to work . And it can - the setting can really change the way people interact with each other . And officers , health staff , nurses , whomever can behave in ways that they might not if they were n't under the - some of the same kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings . <p> And so it 's - I think it 's really important to know how difficult a setting it is to work in . At the same time , it 's not hopeless , certainly . And so I think that is also a misconception we have . There are ways for jails and prisons to be more rehabilitative . And I think we can be all starting a conversation about that . <p> The issue of punishment certainly comes up . Again , from my perspective as a doctor , I have found that positive reinforcement - so that means praising someone or helping someone when they do good things , rather than punishing when they do bad things - is the best way to change behavior . So I think the more that we can try to incorporate that into the mission of the work we do in the jails , the better . <p> GROSS : So this gets back to something we were talking about earlier when you were asking your husband to clip out new articles from the newspaper that might upset you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these things . What kind of things did he clip out ? <p> FORD : Well , sometimes it seemed like it was most of the newspaper , but he - anything that - so he - there was a - I remember one particular day he clipped out an article about a 2 year old who had been left in the car and had , I think , had to be rescued by an ambulance , a story about genocide in a different country , a story about a murder that had happened in the Bronx . And there was a fourth article that I ca n't remember now . <p> But I remember thinking - and he told me these things afterwards - and I just remember thinking if I had read those , I do n't know if I would have been able to hold it together enough to get to work . And sometimes he - I asked him to clip things because I did not want to know about people who might be coming to my care at Bellevue . I did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press . But mostly it was because I was so fragile at that point that anything that involved human vulnerability or cruelty or abuse was very tough for me . <p> GROSS : Can you read the newspaper now ? <p> FORD : I can . ( Laughter ) Yes . I feel like that 's a big step for me . But , yes , I can . <p> GROSS : Well , Elizabeth Ford , thank you so much for talking with us . Thank you . <p> FORD : Oh , it was my pleasure . Thank you very much . <p> GROSS : Dr. Elizabeth Ford 's new memoir about treating mentally i 'll patients from Rikers Island jail .

@@37206782 @6206782/ <h> Churches Still Figuring Out How To Protect Immigrants And Themselves <p> We 're going to spend the next few minutes talking about what 's being called the new sanctuary movement . We 're talking about churches , congregations across the country that are committed to supporting undocumented immigrants who are facing possible detainment or deportation . People like Jeanette Vizguerra . She 's currently living in a sanctuary church in Colorado . <p> JEANETTE VIZGUERRA : ( Through interpreter ) Even though it 's been eight long years up to this point , I know that this is not the point to give up , and my fight is going to continue . <p> MARTIN : And that was Jeanette speaking with the help of a translator at a press conference inside the First Unitarian Church in Denver . That was earlier this year . We 'll hear more about her a little later . NPR reporter Adrian Florido spoke with her during his reporting on the new sanctuary movement for the Code Switch podcast , and he 's with us now to tell us more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ADRIAN FLORIDO , BYLINE : Hi , Michel . Thanks for having me . <p> MARTIN : So what exactly are we talking about here ? Are we talking about congregations that are actually offering refuge to people like Jeanette or are we talking about something else ? How many congregations are we talking about ? <p> FLORIDO : So we 're talking about hundreds of churches that have stepped up in the last few months to say that they 're going to provide some kind of protection to immigrants living in the country illegally . In a lot of cases , that 's just supporting them in ways like food or accompanying them to meetings that they have with immigration and customs enforcement where they feel they may be deported . In other instances , it 's actually inviting immigrants to live in the four walls of the congregation as a way to protect them from immigration agents . <p> MARTIN : Can law enforcement officers go into churches to detain these refugees ? Is there some legal impediment to doing that ? <p> FLORIDO : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency adopted a policy that it does n't make deportation arrests inside what it calls sensitive locations . So that 's places like schools , places like churches , and that 's what opens up the possibility for immigrants to come in and say I need to take refuge in this church . The idea is that they will be protected from deportation . <p> MARTIN : The other question I think that many people will be asking is can churches be prosecuted for harboring someone who is technically in violation of the law ? <p> FLORIDO : So that 's one of the big questions sort of looming over all of this work right now . The most recent time that it was a sort of a major movement in the United States was in the ' 80s when churches and other congregations stepped up to protect immigrants from Central America . <p> At that time , clergy members were prosecuted by the government successfully for doing this work . And so as churches and other congregations right now are beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big question that they have is will we be prosecuted ? How do we protect ourselves against that ? <p> MARTIN : So let 's go back to Jeanette Vizguerra who 's currently living in a church in Colorado , as we said . We heard a bit from her earlier . Why did she feel the need to take this step ? I mean , she has three children who are all born in the United States . She 's still kind of trying to raise them even though she 's living in the church and they are n't . Why would she do something so drastic ? <p> FLORIDO : So Jeanette Vizguerra 's story 's very interesting because she has lived in the U.S. illegally since the ' 90s . In 2009 , she was convicted for using fake documents to get a job . That could have resulted in her deportation , and she did get a deportation order as a result . But through the years of the Obama administration , she was never actually deported because the government did n't consider her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as she regularly checked in with immigration agents . <p> Under the Trump administration because of his recent executive order that prioritizes a much larger category of immigrants for deportation , she was afraid that if she showed up for this scheduled ICE check-in , that she would be deported . She did n't want to take that risk , so she took sanctuary in this church . <p> MARTIN : I would imagine that there 's a balancing act within congregations . People might say I do n't want to be put in the position of breaking the law . Who is this person ? Did that come up in your report ? <p> FLORIDO : I mean , this is absolutely an internal balancing act as well . I had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting that the board of a church was having where they were talking about how far are we willing to go to protect someone ? Who are we willing to take in ? If someone has a criminal record , is that OK ? If it is OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things become things that members of the congregation raise concerns about . It 's very clear that as churches are gearing up to do this kind of work , they 're wrestling with all this tricky messy stuff . <p> MARTIN : That 's Code Switch reporter Adrian Florido .

@@37206783 @6206783/ <h> Arkansas Splits Its Holidays For Martin Luther King Jr . And Robert E. Lee <p> A notice marking the dual holiday honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. , as posted at a Senate Education Committee hearing in Little Rock , Ark . Gov . Asa Hutchinson signed a law separating Lee from the King holiday . <p> Andrew DeMillo / AP <p> Originally published on March 21 , 2017 3:22 pm <p> Updated at 2:10 p.m . ET Tuesday <p> With the stroke of a pen on Tuesday , Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson separated a holiday that has for decades celebrated both Martin Luther King Jr . and Gen. Robert E. Lee in the state . <p> Under the bill that Hutchinson signed into law , King now has the third Monday of January entirely to himself , as dictated by federal law ; Lee will now be commemorated in a state holiday on the second Saturday of October . <p> If the civil rights icon and Confederate general would seem to make for rather odd bedfellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KUAR reports that by a 66-11 vote Friday " with 18 members not voting and five voting present " the Arkansas House of Representatives passed a bill to " eliminate the dual status of the joint holiday , " and to " specify the teaching of content related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . in conjunction with the corresponding holiday . " The Senate had already approved the change . <p> In a statement , Hutchinson commended the passage of the bill , which was co-sponsored by state Sen. David Wallace and state Rep. Grant Hodges , both Republicans . According to KUAR , the governor thanked lawmakers for the bipartisan effort : <p> " The support for a separate holiday to recognize Martin Luther King far exceeded my expectations and speaks well of the General Assembly and our state . This bill was one of my priorities , and I was honored to testify for it in both Chambers . I look forward to having a signing ceremony that emphasizes the historic dynamic of this new day . " <p> Arkansas has celebrated Lee 's memory since 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan signed a law enacting a federal holiday for the reverend . Their respective holidays were combined in 1985 under Bill Clinton , who was then governor of the state . <p> As KUAR notes , not every lawmaker was in favor of putting the two asunder . <p> " We are taking Robert E. Lee and we are putting him in the basement and we are acting embarrassed that he ever existed , " Republican Rep. Jana Della Rosa said during debate before the bill 's passage . " It 's no different than if we went out and we took that statue of the Confederate Soldiers and put it down in the basement and said nobody 's going to look at it again . " <p> Still , Friday 's vote brings Arkansas in line with much of the rest of the country . When the bill was signed into law Tuesday " after the originally scheduled signing ceremony was bumped from Monday " Arkansas left the exclusive club of states that celebrate both men on the same day .

@@37206784 @6206784/ <p> Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , explains the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act during his weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday . <p> Win McNamee / Getty Images <p> Originally published on March 10 , 2017 4:43 pm <p> The Affordable Care Act changed women 's health care in some big ways : It stopped insurance companies from charging women extra , forced insurers to cover maternity care and contraceptives and allowed many women to get those contraceptives ( as well as a variety of preventive services , like Pap smears and mammograms ) at zero cost . <p> Now Republicans have the opportunity to repeal that law , also known as Obamacare . But that does n't mean all those things will go away . In fact , many will remain . <p> Confused ? Here 's a rundown of how this bill would change some women-specific areas of health care , what it would n't change , and what we do n't know so far . <p> But the GOP bill tightens this . It says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be spent at all on any health care plan that covers abortion ( aside from the Hyde Amendment 's exceptions ) . <p> So while health care plans can cover abortion , very few people may be able to purchase those sorts of plans , as they would n't be able to use their tax credits on them . That could make it much more expensive and difficult to obtain an abortion under this law than under current law . <p> Planned Parenthood funding <p> This bill partially " defunds " Planned Parenthood , meaning it would cut back on the federal funding that can be used for services at the clinics . Fully 43 percent of Planned Parenthood 's revenue in fiscal year 2015 " more than $550 million " came from government grants and reimbursements . <p> Right now , under Obamacare , federal funds can be spent at Planned Parenthood , but they ca n't be used for abortion " again , a result of the Hyde Amendment and again , with the three Hyde Amendment exceptions . But this bill goes further , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be clear , it 's not that there 's a funding stream going directly from the government to Planned Parenthood that Congress can just turn off . Rather , the program reimburses Planned Parenthood for the care it provides to Medicaid recipients . So this bill would mean that Medicaid recipients who currently receive care at an organization that provides abortions would have to find a new provider ( whom Medicaid would then reimburse ) . <p> Abortion is a small part of what Planned Parenthood does : The organizations says it accounted for 3.4 percent of all services provided in the year ending in September 2014 . ( Of course , some patients receive more than one service ; Planned Parenthood had around 2.5 million patients in that year . Assuming one abortion per patient , that 's roughly 13 percent of all patients receiving abortions . ) <p> Together , providing contraception and the testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases made up three-quarters of the services the organization provided in one year . <p> That means low-income women ( that is , women on Medicaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , as it may force them to find other providers for reproductive health services . <p> Of the other government money that goes to Planned Parenthood , most of it comes from Title X. That federal program , created under President Richard Nixon , provides family planning services to people beyond Medicaid , like low-income women who are not **25;120;TOOLONG this year , Republicans started the process of stripping that funding . <h> What would n't change ( yet ) : <p> Republicans have stressed that this bill was just one of three parts , so it 's hard to say definitively what would n't change at all as a result of their plan . But thus far , here 's what is holding steady : <p> Maternity and contraceptive coverage <p> Because this was a reconciliation bill , it could cover fiscal-related topics only . It could n't get into many of the particulars of what people 's coverage will look like , meaning some things wo n't change . <p> The essential health benefits set out in Obamacare " a list of 10 types of services that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies . Maternity care is included in those benefits , as is contraception , so plans will have to continue to cover those . The GOP bill also does n't change the Obamacare policy that gave women access to free contraception , as Vox 's Emily Crockett reported . <p> In addition , maternity and contraception are still both " mandatory benefits " under Medicaid . That does n't change in the GOP bill . ( Confusingly , the bill does sunset essential health benefits for Medicaid recipients . But because there is overlap and these particular benefits remain " mandatory , " they are n't going away . ) <p> However , all of this wo n't necessarily remain unchanged . In response to a question about defunding Planned Parenthood this week , Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that he did n't want to " violate anybody 's conscience . " When a reporter asked how this relates to birth control , Price did not give a definite answer . <p> " We 're working through all of those issues , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule-making process , and we 're working through that . So that 's not a part of this piece of legislation right here . " <p> So this is something that could easily change in the second " phase " of the health care plan , when rules are changed . <p> " Preventative services the category that includes contraception has n't been touched , but we expect those to be touched probably via regulation , " said Laurie Sobel , associate director for women 's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> The end of gender rating <p> Prior to Obamacare , women were often charged more for the same health plans as men . The rationale was that women tend to use more health care services than men .

It 's been a dizzying change from just a few weeks ago when President Trump had nothing bad to say about Russia . But here he is this past Wednesday at the White House . 190095 @qwx390095 <p> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Right now , we 're not getting along with Russia at all . We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia . <p> MARTIN : And just in case the message was n't loud and clear that the administration is now taking a firm line with Moscow , the CIA director joined the pile on this week as well . Here 's Mike Pompeo taking a shot at Vladimir Putin. 190095 @qwx390095 <p> MIKE POMPEO : For anyone who for a moment thinks that this is a credible man , I 'll remind you what he said about the airplane that was shot down , the Malaysian airplane . Go look at his initial quotes . Go look at what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in Ukraine and the fact that he later actually said himself that , in fact , it was his team . And I think to this day he continues to claim that there are no Russians in eastern Ukraine . This is a man for whom veracity does n't translate into English . <p> MARTIN : But let 's take note the tough talk on Russia comes as the FBI and Congress forge ahead with probes into ties between Trump aides and Russia . NPR 's Mary Louise Kelly has been all over this , so we thought this was a good time to bring her back in to tie all these threads together for us . Mary Louise , thanks so much for joining us once again . <p> MARY LOUISE KELLY , BYLINE : My pleasure . Hey , Michel . <p> MARTIN : So , first of all , tell us about this new tough line on Russia . How big a reversal is this ? <p> KELLY : It is enough to give you whiplash . I was in the room when Mike Pompeo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time he 's spoken publicly as CIA director , and you could see the eyebrows shooting up as he basically called Vladimir Putin a liar . It is striking because we are , as you know , not yet even three months into the Trump presidency , a presidency that opened with the Trump-Putin bromance on full display . And we have seen a striking shift this week . Some of that 's to be expected . Every administration takes a while to hit its stride and figure out where it 's going to chart its path diplomatically . But this week , very striking shift and a shift very much influenced by events in Syria . <p> MARTIN : You 're talking about the missile strikes that President Trump ordered last week . <p> KELLY : Right , correct , and the chemical weapons attack that precipitated those strikes . The White House says that Syria carried out a chemical weapons attack on its own citizens on April 4 . Syria denies that . Russia , Syria 's main ally , also denies that . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the release of a pretty remarkable report in which the White House accuses Russia of helping to cover up a chemical weapons attack in Syria the same day that President Trump came out and made that remark we just heard about relations being at an all-time low . Now , that ignores some pretty key moments in history . You know , all-time low - you compare it to the Cuban missile crisis . I do n't think we 're quite there , but it does underscore just how dramatic a turn things have taken in the last several days . <p> MARTIN : OK . So let me ask you to turn to the latest twists and turns in the investigations into Russia and the 2016 election . There were some major developments this week , and it would have been easy to miss among all the other news , so would you tell us about that ? <p> KELLY : The drip , drip of leaks continues . The biggest development arguably this week involved Carter Page , who people may recall was a campaign adviser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we learned is that the FBI obtained a secret court order to monitor his communications . They got this last summer . Now , to get that secret court order , the FBI would have had to convince a judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was working as a foreign agent on Russia 's behalf , which sounds like a huge development , a huge twist . And on the one hand , Page was at best a bit player in Trump 's orbit . He never joined the administration . <p> The White House has distanced himself . He 's not been charged with any crime . In that sense , this is a little incremental . On the other hand , as The Washington Post - which broke this story - has reported , this is the clearest evidence we have seen so far that the FBI had reason to believe a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents . That 's kind of a big deal . <p> MARTIN : Paul Manafort , who was decidedly not a bit player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step down last August because of questions about his ties to Ukraine and Russia . There was a development involving him this week . What did we learn ? <p> KELLY : There were yet more questions about those ties to Ukraine and to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine . And what we learned this week Manafort revealed that he would register as a foreign agent for lobbying work , work that was done years before he joined camp Trump we should note . He 's registering retroactively , which is an admission that he should have registered as a foreign agent before and he did n't . As a consequence of registering , he 's going to have to lay out who was he lobbying in the U.S. government , what did he get paid , what are the details of his contract . That could all be really interesting to watch unfold in the context of these investigations . Again , though , this is for work years before he was working with Trump , so how much it may come to haunt this White House is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go , I 'm going to ask you to step back and kind of give us the big picture . <p> KELLY : I think the takeaway this week is we continue to learn of connections between people close to Trump and Russia . I mean , there 's the people we 've been talking about . There 's the former national security adviser , Michael Flynn . There 's the current attorney general , Jeff Sessions . There 's Jared Kushner , Trump 's son-in-law and adviser , who , by the way , is number one on the list of people who the Senate Intelligence Committee , which is investigating , say they want to talk to . None of these people are accused of criminal wrongdoing . On the other hand , none of them have been especially forthcoming about contacts that they have had with Russian officials . So you have this drip , drip , drip that continues to cloud these early months of the Trump presidency and continues to raise questions about whether this White House might be vulnerable to foreign influence .

This week they have increased air strikes around the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . American special operations troops have rappelled out of helicopters along with local troops to begin an attack on a strategic dam held by ISIS . The Pentagon says a push to take the city of Raqqa is coming soon and the U.S. will play a key role . To talk more about that , we 're joined by NPR 's Pentagon correspondent , Tom Bowman .

Hi there . <p> ALICE FORDHAM , BYLINE : Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's start with you . We are going to see more big U.S. operations in Syria . What is the plan ? <p> BOWMAN : OK , what we 're seeing is a more aggressive version , Kelly , of the Obama strategy . It 's not really a new Trump plan . And it 's worked with , trained , in some cases accompanied local rebels and had the U.S. serve as its air force . And along these more aggressive lines you 're going to see two things pretty soon , I think . The U.S. plans to send in hundreds more trainers in special operations forces . Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has n't really signed off on that yet . And also , the U.S. will send weapons - small arms , heavy machine guns , tank rounds - to U.S.-backed Arab and Kurdish forces for this final assault on Raqqa . And Kelly , that last part , supporting Kurdish forces , is a problem for America 's ally Turkey . They see all these Kurds as terrorists . So a big question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've spoken to a few people in Turkey and who analyze Turkey , and no one 's exactly sure what the response would be .

A less what you might call nuclear option and something they have done before is to use their own forces and their proxies inside Syria , some of which are themselves supported by the U.S. , to attack these Kurdish-led factions . <p> That has already happened near a town called Manbij after it was retaken from ISIS . And when that happened , American forces actually intervened in support of the Kurdish ones .

I mean , Tom , there are a number of factions involved in Syria - right ? - the Syrian government , also Russia , Turkey and Iranian-backed militias . I mean , many of these are not allied with the U.S. or with each other . How is the United States going to handle operating in such a complicated environment as it goes after Raqqa ? <p> BOWMAN : You know , Kelly , that 's a key question that people are looking at right now . Now , officials , of course , have talked about possible safe zones for civilians .

But there are also discussions about how do you separate these warring parties that you just mentioned ?

Now , they could be on the outskirts of the city and you could see local forces actually patrol inside the city and , of course , police . But yeah , you 're looking at what will likely be a U.S. presence in Syria for some time . And clearly next door in Iraq we 're going to see thousands of U.S. troops . They 've already talked about a more permanent presence in Iraq . <p> MCEVERS : Alice , do we have any sense of how this ramping up of military action around Raqqa is impacting the people there ? <p> FORDHAM : Sure .

@@37206792 @6206792/ <p> An international team of biologists and ecologists used GPS and body-acceleration data on juvenile white storks to report on shifts in the birds ' migratory behaviors . They concluded that " wintering in Europe instead of Africa enhances juvenile survival in a long-distance migrant , " which is also the title of their paper . <p> The research team lead by Shay Rotics of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem starts by noting that bird migration patterns are known to be marked by plasticity : <p> " In many Holarctic bird species , migration phenology is adjusting towards an earlier arrival to breeding grounds to accommodate the earlier onset of spring brought about by global warming . In addition , an increasing number of studies have also reported that Holarctic migrants are shortening their migration and overwinter at higher latitudes closer to their breeding grounds . " <p> Their study birds , 54 white storks from a population located in Germany , illustrates this in-progress shift in overwintering . Traditionally , these birds use a flyway corridor to migrate to Africa " but now a minority of them migrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only compared the survival rates of six Europe-overwintering and 48 Africa-overwintering juvenile white storks , they also fitted the birds with small solar-charged GPS transmitters to monitor specifics of their movement patterns . <p> Of the six Europe-overwintering birds , 100 percent survived through their first year , versus only 38 percent of the Africa-overwintering ones . It 's hard to pinpoint precisely why that survival difference occurred , but thanks to the GPS data , a key probable factor " in addition to the obvious one of the reduced flight distance involved " can be suggested . <p> At the Europe overwintering grounds , the birds displayed reduced movement , and used smaller foraging habitats . They foraged more at anthropogenic sites such as rubbish dumps and agricultural areas , which apparently takes less energy than hunting for prey in the wild . <p> That probably helped all of them to make it , instead of only a fraction . <p> So how come , then , do most of these white storks go all the way to Africa , if they can do well closer to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the migrators to Africa " display suboptimal migratory behavior . " Here 's what they write : <p> " Our findings relate to the first-year period , although , in the long run , overwintering in Europe might not necessarily be the optimal option , possibly due to long-term detrimental effects of feeding on waste or erratic effects of severe winters . Furthermore , survival benefits of overwintering in Europe may be restricted to juveniles and might even be reversed at older ages , as has been found in other birds . " <p> They go on to note that a European Union directive to reduce open landfill areas is likely to significantly decrease the suitability of European wintering grounds for migratory birds , including white storks . <p> It would be entirely wrong to jump from a study showing good survival in a small sample of white storks to a conclusion that anthropogenic global warming is n't so bad after all for migratory birds because they are reducing their flight distance and thriving closer to home . <p> As Rotics et al . explain , we know neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the suitability of those European landscapes for migratory birds will be sustained . <p> Even more importantly , the overall threats of global warming to birds generally are quite clear .

@@37206795 @6206795/ <h> The Power Of Genes , And The Line Between Biology And Destiny <p> This is FRESH AIR . I 'm David Bianculli , editor of the website TV Worth Watching , sitting in for Terry Gross . The way we understand and discuss identity , temperament , gender , sexual orientation and gender dysphoria are being profoundly changed by our new knowledge about the human genome . The study of genetics also is fundamentally changing our understanding of disease , from schizophrenia to cancer . New cancer treatments are being developed that address the genetic mutations that cause cancer . <p> Today 's guest , Siddhartha Mukherjee , has written a best-selling book called " Gene , " which is now out in paperback . It tells the history of genetics and reports on new breakthroughs and ethical questions resulting from gene manipulation . Mukherjee wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book " The Emperor Of All Maladies " about the history of cancer and its treatments . It was adapted into a PBS series of the same name . He 's an oncologist specializing in blood cancers and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body 's immune cells . <p> Mukherjee is an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University and a staff cancer physician at Columbia University Medical Center . He spoke with Terry last year when his book was first published . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST ) <p> TERRY GROSS , HOST : <p> Siddhartha Mukherjee , welcome to FRESH AIR . So how are genetics giving us a new understanding of disease , a new model by which to understand disease and treat it ? <p> SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE : Well , genetics has really overturned the classical or traditional conception of disease . We - you know , we used to think of disease as something that happened to us . Genetics allows us to really begin to think of disease as something that happens as a result of us interacting with the environment . That 's not to say - let 's be very clear up front - that 's not to say that all diseases are genetic . And that 's also not to say that all diseases are environmental . <p> But it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many , many diseases are acutely dependent on the intersection between genes and the environment . And if you leave one part of that equation out , you 'll inevitably miss something important about that disease . You wo n't know how to treat it . You wo n't know how to understand it . And that 's one of the ideas that 's central to this book . <p> GROSS : So let 's talk about cancer , since you 're an oncologist . Cancers have always been treated based on the part of the body or the organ that they 've affected . So it 's like breast , liver , blood , lung cancer . What is genetics showing us about the similarities and differences within each type of tumor in each category , like , the similarities and differences of breast cancer tumors or leukemias or , you know , lung cancers ? <p> MUKHERJEE : There 's a substantial degree of reorganization in the way we fundamentally think about cancer that 's going on right now . Some of it related - or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the mutations in individual cancers , you might find , actually , that a lung cancer carries a mutation that it shares with , let 's say , a breast cancer or it shares a mutation that it shares with leukemia . The question that 's being asked right now in the field , which is an important question , is is there - therefore , should we reorganize this old anatomical classification of cancer - you know , lung cancer , breast cancer - and base it a little bit more on a kind of mixed classification . <p> Yeah , you say breast cancer , which has these following mutations . My overall impression is that the anatomical classification is n't going to go away . I think they 're very important things that the anatomy determines . There are genes that are particular to breast cancer . There are genes that are particular to lung cancer . But it 's going to be vastly refined . And we 're seeing this already with genetics . So we 're going to say lung cancer but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And we might , in fact , treat these two cancers similarly - this leukemia and the lung cancer similarly . But I do n't think that the anatomical classification 's going to go away completely . It 's a very important classification that will remain . <p> GROSS : So I understand the concept that chemotherapy is a toxic substance that kills fast-growing cells . And therefore , it can kill fast-growing cancer cells and kill a lot of healthy cells along the way , too . So I get what works and what 's bad about chemo . I do n't really understand how you target a mutation , like a genetic mutation , with drugs - or with what ? Like , how do you ... <p> MUKHERJEE : Well , the classical ... <p> GROSS : Yeah . <p> MUKHERJEE : ... Example is these genetic mutations make products - make proteins . Genes make proteins . They make RNA , which then is used to build a protein . And these proteins really act as kind of pathological drivers of a cancer cell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it behave abnormally . And the trick is to create a medicine , a drug , a small molecule - it could be other things - but a small molecule that goes and enlarges itself in the cleft of that protein and shuts it off like a little hand shutting off a switch . The key point here is that because the cancer cells have this mutated gene , and therefore make the abnormal protein , normal cells do n't have it . And that 's the ideal scenario . <p> And therefore , you know , your drug will have very little effect , hopefully , on normal cells and have a profound effect on cancer cells . And we have drugs like this already in the armamentarium . There 's a drug called Gleevec . I 've written about it . Others have written - it 's obviously incredibly famous - and it does exactly that . <p> There 's a lovely description of Gleevec that someone once described Gleevec to me . It 's like an arrow that pierces the heart of this abnormal protein that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pierce the heart of normal cells , for the most part . So that 's the ideal scenario . The less ideal scenario is that , you know , the drug does n't work with all that much specificity , it 's not such an arrow that 's fine-tuned to the Achilles ' heel of a cancer cell . But it has some collateral damage . <p> But the ultimate aim is to have a drug that somewhere falls somewhere between the exquisite specificity for a cancer cell and perhaps a slightly more moderated specificity , might kill some normal cells but is nowhere near the indiscriminate killing that chemotherapy used to have . <p> GROSS : So in talking about how new understanding of genetics is creating new cancer therapies , I want to ask you about work that you 're doing now , which is related to a certain form of blood cancer in which you 're genetically modifying T cells . You 're genetically modifying the immune system , basically . Would you explain what you 're doing ? <p> MUKHERJEE : We 're - again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do is trying to refocus the immune system on cancer . <p> A little bit of background here helps . The idea that your own immune system could fight your cancer has a long history . Some of it is detailed in " Emperor Of All Maladies " and led to amazing therapies for some cancers , such as bone marrow transplantation for leukemias , although it does n't work for many other cancers . <p> So the idea that somehow or the other , your immune system could be refocused on your cancer is an old idea . But it 's really come to life again because we now have a host of new medicines that allow us to potentially reactivate the immune system and make it recognize and kill cancer cells again . The idea grew out of something very interesting , and it was worked on in the 1990s and 2000s by a whole bunch of researchers that showed that when a cancer arises in a human being , it might do so - not true for all human beings - but it might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something about the immune response that how , fundamentally , the cancer cells had escaped . <p> And that led to the hypothesis that we would activate the immune system and then thereby could sort of refocus it or make it sort of wake up and recognize the cancer again . We 're trying variants of that in leukemia and MDS . Other people have shown it to be very effective , for instance , in melanoma or even in lung cancers . Those are the diseases that they 've been particularly effective in . And we 're trying some of this in leukemia . <p> GROSS : So you 're testing it on mice now ? <p> MUKHERJEE : We 're testing it on mice . We 're testing it in test tubes . There 's a whole platform that we 're trying to develop to try to figure out how we could bring this to the clinic . <p> GROSS : So what exactly are you interfering with genetically ? <p> MUKHERJEE : We 're interfering with the way that T cells recognize cancer cells . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from the T cells , the kind of cloaks and sheaths that they put up in order to escape from the immune system . So - and all of these ultimately are genetic . They are genes that are activated , repressed , that change their nature , that allow this kind of cloaking phenomenon to occur . <p> And then we 're doing both . We are both activating , waking up the immune system , sort of shaking it awake and we 're changing things in the cancer cells that allow it to cloak itself against the immune system and thereby escape . <p> GROSS : If you 're just joining us , my guest is doctor and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee . And he 's the author of " The Emperor Of All Maladies , " the best-selling book about the history of cancer , the disease and its treatments that was adapted into a public television series . He has a new book called " The Gene : An Intimate History . " Let 's take a short break here , then we 'll talk some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG , " PEACOCKS " ) <p> GROSS : This is FRESH AIR , and if you 're just joining us , my guest is oncologist and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee . He 's the author of the new book " The Gene : An Intimate History . " It 's about genetics and medicine . He 's also the author of " The Emperor Of All Maladies , " which was a history of cancer and cancer treatments . <p> How do you make genetic - I know you ca n't explain this to me . It 's probably way too complicated . But how do you make genetic changes in cancer cells ? <p> MUKHERJEE : You know , making genetic changes in cells used to be very complicated . We used to be able to use viruses and deliver some genes into the cells . We used to make - be able to make mutations by exposing cells to , for instance , X-rays . But if you were to ask me 10 years ago , you know , can you change this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do it , but it 's pretty hard to do . <p> What 's happened in the last five years - and it 's really 5 years old , this technology - this technology has allowed us in an astonishing way to go into a normal cell or a cancer cell , even potentially an embryonic stem cell , and essentially directionally or intentionally make a mutation in a single gene in an intentional manner . <p> So I 've likened this technology to saying - you know , it 's like saying that if you imagine the human genome as a vast encyclopedia - in fact , if you can actually imagine the human genome as a vast encyclopedia , it would contain 66 full sets of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica , " but repeating over and over again A-C-T-G-G-C-T-C-C-G-C-C , so forth . <p> Totally inscrutable to you and me , but of course extremely scrutable to a cell . What this technology allows us to do , essentially , is to go into that 66 entire sets of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave most of the rest of the encyclopedia untouched . I 'm saying most of the rest because there are still some collateral effects . <p> You sometimes get the wrong place . The technology hits the wrong place . But what it allows you to do is you can erase one word and replace it with a slightly different word . And that 's how powerful the technology is . <p> And so , therefore , you could now ask me , which you could n't ask me five years ago , is it easy to make a directional or intentional change in a cell ? And the answer I would say - infinitely easier today , infinitely easier compared to how it was 5 or 10 years ago . <p> GROSS : There 's a lot of ethical issues involved with this kind of technology . What are some of those ethical questions that are being raised ? <p> MUKHERJEE : I mean , the biggest ethical questions are should we be tampering with the human genome when we do n't know very much about it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to the question of , you know , what is disease ? What is a genetic disease ? In " Gene , " I offer a simple formulation that we might be able to think about . I say , you know , what we might think about - one question that you might think about is we 're going to change some genetic material , are we sure that the benefits outweigh the risk ? <p> I mean , is there truly extraordinary suffering associated with that disease ? Now , the word extraordinary suffering - the phrase extraordinary suffering - you know , one person 's extraordinary suffering can be not another person 's extraordinary suffering , but at least we can use the word extraordinary to say that this is not a casual technology . We should n't be using this , obviously , to change the shape of eyes or the color of hair and so forth . So that 's one . <p> The second idea is that we should be only using any of these technologies , any genetic technologies - and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies when we know that the gene really produces that disease in a relatively 1-to-1 manner . I gave you some examples before . I said , you know , some diseases , you know that when you have the genetic mutation , chances that you 'll have that terrifying disease is high . Those are very penetrant . So the idea that , you know , we should n't be using these technologies to even do anything in diseases where we do n't know how genes interact with each other , what the levels of complexity are - we should be really careful about that idea . <p> And the third principle or the third arena is to make sure that there 's choice involved in this - that none of this is done by mandate . It 's not done by - because we want people to do or behave this way but that there 's a phenomenon of justifiable choice . So you can imagine this sort of as a triangle . One side of the triangle has the idea of extraordinary suffering . The other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete penetrance . And the third side of the triangle has the idea of justifiable choice . As long as , I think , those - we stick within that triangle , as it were , at least we 'll know that we 're not just tampering with the human genome in a totally unsafe way . <p> But even that , it really raises a series of ethical and moral questions . How much should we change the human genome ? Should we change it in a way that may lead us into areas that we are totally unsure about ? Should we do it ever in an embryonic stem cell that has the capacity to become a full-fledged embryo ? There are steep barricades in the United States that prevent us from being able to do much of this stuff . <p> GROSS : So once the genes have been altered in some kind of way , can any of those changes be passed on to the next generation ? <p> MUKHERJEE : Again , a very important and complicated question . In simple organisms such as yeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that you can take these sort of environmental reactions and transmit them across generations . Plants seem to be able to do this as well . <p> The question in humans is very complicated . There 's some evidence that when you have a famine , gene regulation occurs , transcription factors change , genes get turned on and off . And then they recruit other marks into the genome , which can potentially be transmitted across one generation , maybe across two generations . <p> Aside from that in humans , there 's very little evidence of environmental information being able to transmit across multiple generations . It 's just very important to be careful with this because , of course , the idea that you can transmit information across multiple generations raises the prospect of Lamarck , you know - giraffes becoming taller by stretching their necks longer or animals being able to run faster because they ran away from animals fast themselves . And somehow , this information gets passed on to their offspring and you can shortcut evolution . That 's very rarely true and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be passed from the environment into the genome is very idiosyncratic . We know very little about it in humans . In simple organisms and in plants , there 's evidence for it , but there 's a word of caution in the book . In fact , the section begins with this idea . It says a note of caution here that these events are idiosyncratic , these are rare , and should not invite fantasies of overturning , you know , Darwinian evolution for Lamarckian evolution , which is - just really is not true . <p> GROSS : There 's an example in your own family of inherited illness . And there 's also an example in your family of identical twins . And everybody knows that identical twins raise so many questions about what is inherited and what is a function of experience and the environment that you live in . So what are we learning about identical twins and their genetic makeup and how the genes affect them and how environment affects them in spite of the genes ? <p> MUKHERJEE : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance that the other twin will become schizophrenic is strikingly high - four , five - some people say a little bit less - but 3 to 5 times the risk of the general population . So we know that if you have identical genomes , the chances that you will develop certain diseases is high even though these diseases , obviously , can have multiple genes . The point is that if you and your twin have exactly the same genome - give or take some changes that occur over time and in utero . But you have essentially the same substrate . <p> And now more and more we 're discovering that this is shared across multiple genes . Again , the important thing to realize is that for most diseases - not for all diseases - but for most chronic human diseases , that number is about 20 percent , 30 percent - that number of - the chances that you and your identical twin will have the same disease . It 's not 100 percent , and therefore , yet again , we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a combination of genes , plus environment , plus triggers , plus chance . As long as we remember that formula , we can generally be accurate about genetics - genes plus environments plus triggers plus form . That allows us to be careful about describing the fact that genes absolutely matter . They matter in diseases like schizophrenia , they matter in diseases like diabetes , in diseases - obviously the way your body is shaped . They matter in diseases like obesity . And yet , it 's not all genes . <p> GROSS : So sometimes you have a genetic predisposition to something , but it does n't guarantee you 're going to get that thing . <p> MUKHERJEE : A classical example of that , of course , is the BRCA1 gene . Not every woman who has the BRCA1 gene will get breast cancer . And yet , the chances that a woman with a BRCA1 gene gets breast cancer are strikingly higher than the general population if you do n't have BRCA1 . <p> BIANCULLI : Author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll continue their conversation .

" <p> I 'm David Bianculli , and this is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF DAVID FELDMAN 'S " CHORA TUA TRISTEZA " ) <p> BIANCULLI : This is FRESH AIR . I 'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross , back with more of Terry 's interview from last year with author Siddhartha Mukherjee . His latest book , titled " Gene , " is now out in paperback . He also wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book " The Emperor Of All Maladies , " a history of cancer and cancer treatments . He 's an oncologist at Columbia University Medical Center and is working on developing a therapy intended to treat certain cancer sells by modifying the body 's immune system . <p> Genetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . He has two uncles and a cousin who were schizophrenic , and his mother has an identical twin sister . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST ) <p> GROSS : Genes are actually teaching scientists a lot about the nature of gender and of gender identity and maybe of sexual orientation . So let me start with sexual orientation . There was talk in the ' 90s about discovering , like , a gay gene . What do scientists think now ? Is there a genetic explanation for homosexuality ? <p> MUKHERJEE : Tremendously important question and a tremendously controversial question , but we know quite a lot of data on it . So let me just present the data , and then we 'll go into this idea in a second . If you take identical twins , male twins , the chances that these male twins will share a sexual orientation is much higher than siblings , for instance . <p> Now , what does that tell us ? That tells us that there may be genetic determinants - because identical twins have exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sexual orientation . That number that - the - how much they share is not 100 percent . So in other words , if one twin is gay , the other twin will not necessarily be gay . It 's not 100 percent exactly the same . <p> So we know that either genes or intrauterine exposures or some other factors , environments , have a powerful effect on this society . Culture has powerful effects on this , but we know also that there must be at least some genes involved . And if you look carefully at the patterns , it 's clear that not one gene is involved . There 's not one single gay gene , that probably multiple genes are involved . In fact , I do n't even like that term gay gene . I think it 's very misleading as an idea . <p> It 's a gene that influences a sexual preference , and , of course , most of this work has been done in males . There 's very , very little evidence in females . So we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved . But when people have gone to look for those genetic determinants , the hunt has come up quite not so clear . So the summary is basically that thus far , we have not found - as I said , I do n't like the word or the phrase - we 've not found a gay gene . And it 's unlikely that we 'll find one . <p> There probably will be - like many phenomena in human identity - there will be multiple genetic determinants interacting with environments . But it 's very important to be clear about these ideas ' cause otherwise we fall into language that 's all incorrect and wrong . And then you just foster nonsensical controversy . <p> GROSS : But by saying that there is likely some kind of genetic predisposition to be straight or to be gay , that makes a significant contribution to discussions about gay-related issues and marriage equality and things like that . <p> MUKHERJEE : You know , in some ways - and I like to think of " Gene " this way - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity . Human variation abounds . We have a huge amount of variation , and we do n't know yet the consequences of this variation . But we also have a huge amount of similarity . We are a young species . We have n't been around for very long . So in fact , there are deep similarities and a few dissimilarities , and the gene is a plea for a kind of radical conception of human equality . <p> GROSS : So let 's talk about gender identity . What are genetic scientists learning about people who have the discrepancy between their gender anatomy and their gender identity ? <p> MUKHERJEE : So for the large part , gender anatomy , whether you 're male or female in terms of the sexual anatomy , is determined really by one master regulator gene . It 's a transcription factor , as you can imagine , one of these master genes . And unsurprisingly , it sits in the Y chromosome . If you have the Y chromosome and therefore inherit the gene , then you will be born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for most people , you will have the gender anatomy of a male . If you do n't have the gene , you will be born female and have the gender anatomy , for the most part , of a female . <p> Now - but once in a while , this pattern is changed . Occasionally , there are people , rare human beings , where you inherit the Y chromosome , but you do n't - you have a mutation in that SRY gene . So essentially , for the - you are born with the Y chromosome . But essentially , your anatomy , and for the most part your identity , is female . That teaches us something very important . <p> That means that as far as gender anatomy is concerned , as far as even gender identity is concerned , there is one master regulator . So it tells us that it 's a single master regulator , and we know what that master regulator is . What it also tells us , and this is where things get most interesting , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recruit downstream things . It 's not - it does n't act on its own . <p> It 's sort of like the commander in the army . But the commander in the army still has to have recruited its deployment of all the other troops , all the other - you know , the hierarchy , as it were . And there are infinite variations along that hierarchy . So you could still have , as it were , the master regulator , a commanding male gender anatomy and a different hierarchical organization flowing down from it , which would lead to slight different variations or radically different variations in gender identity . In other words , you 'll have male anatomy , but you may not have all the same aspects - or people have different aspects of male identity . <p> So the point here being is that genes can sit at peaks or at pentacles of cascades or hierarchies and command things in an on-and-off manner - female , male . But the way that these genes - this genetic information percolates down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual might be very different from one person to another and therefore create the kind of infinite ripples or variations in human identity that we experience in human life . <p> GROSS : If you 're just joining us , my guest is oncologist and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee . His new book is called " The Gene . " He 's also the author of " The Emperor Of All Maladies , " which was a best-selling history of cancer and cancer treatments . We have to take a short break here , but then we 'll be right back . This is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF us , my guest is oncologist and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee . His new book is called " The Gene . " It 's a history of genetics and how what we 're learning about genetics can be applied to the treatment of diseases . And he 's also the author of " The Emperor Of All Maladies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So I would like to think that genetics does n't mean that biology is destiny . In other words , I would like to think that just ' cause you 're born with female sex organs does n't mean that you are genetically confined to being , you know , less strong or less capable than men , which was what , historically , was projected on women . <p> At the same time , I 'd like to think that genetics can help us understand people who identify as trans , who were born with , say , female sex organs but identify as male or vice versa - born with male sex organs but they identify as female . Is that too much to ask ? Do you think that genetics may be able to do both , to say biology is n't destiny when it comes to gender , but also help us understand why some people identify as trans ? <p> MUKHERJEE : Absolutely . The centerpiece of this book is that biology is not destiny . But some aspects of biology and some aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked about one such aspect , at least . The anatomy of gender is strongly determined by genes . But you could - there 's no reason that that can not be reconciled with the idea that there are a thousand variations that might influence some other aspect of your destiny and biology . And that might be the nature of your identity . <p> So the fact that these two are held up as sort of mutually oppositional , biology is n't destiny and biology is destiny , reminds us why we need to understand the details . The truth is in the details . We need to understand genes - what they are , how they act , what they do - in order to be able to make that statement that , you know , biology is n't destiny . And biology is some parts of destiny . These are not mutually opposed . It depends on what you 're talking about . It depends on what question you 're asking and what answer you 're seeking . <p> If you do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the language of genetics or genes , you 'll get misled . And once you 're misled , you now enter a tremendously divisive public discourse in a way that 's incorrect . <p> GROSS : That 's a very helpful answer . Thank you very much for that . I want to ask about your own genes . Have you decided whether to or not to get genetically tested yourself ? And I should mention here that there is a history of schizophrenia in your family . You had two uncles and a cousin with schizophrenia . You know , what scientists are learning about schizophrenia is that there is a genetic component to it , a genetic predisposition . So do you want to get tested for that or other illnesses ? <p> MUKHERJEE : I 've chosen not to be tested . And I will probably choose not to be tested for a long time , until I start getting information back from genetic testing that 's very deterministic . Again , remember that idea of penetrance that we talked about . Some genetic variations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of anatomical traits and so forth . <p> I think that right now , for diseases like schizophrenia , we 're nowhere close to that place . The most that we know is that there are multiple genes in familial schizophrenia , the kind that our family has . Essentially , we do n't know how to map , as it were . There 's no one-to-one correspondence between a genome and the chances of developing schizophrenia . <p> And until we can create that map - and whether we can create that map ever is a question - but until I - we can create that map , I will certainly not be tested because it - that idea - I mean , that 's , again , the center of the book . That confines you . It becomes predictive . You become - it 's a chilling word that I use in the book - you become a previvor ( ph ) . A previvor is someone who 's survived an illness that they have n't even had yet . You live in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very Orwellian idea . And I think we should resist it as much as possible . <p> GROSS : Would you feel that way if you were a woman and there was a history of breast cancer in your family ? <p> MUKHERJEE : Very tough question . If I was a woman and I had a history of breast cancer in my family and if the history was striking enough - and , you know , here 's a - it 's a place where a genetic counselor helps . If the history was striking enough , I would probably sequence at least the genes that have been implicated in breast cancer , no doubt about it . <p> GROSS : OK . <p> MUKHERJEE : I recommend this for my patients . <p> GROSS : OK .

@@37206796 @6206796/ <h> Could ' No Kill ' For Shelter Cats And Dogs Be Policy By 2025 ? <p> A coalition of animal-rescue organizations led by the Best Friends Animal Society based in Kanab , Utah , is aiming to bring the nation to " no kill " status for shelter cats and dogs by the year 2025 . <p> Next week , a new pet adoption center will open in Soho in New York City to intensify no-kill efforts in that city and to bring attention to the national initiative . <p> The term " no kill " means different things to different people . Some shelters can euthanize up to 10 percent of their animals for reasons of health and temperament and still be considered " no-kill . " <p> In a telephone call last week , Best Friends co-founder and CEO Gregory Castle said that in terms of the 2025 goal , the aim is to save 90 percent of dogs and cats in U.S. animal shelters from being killed . Based on a county-by-county survey done by Best Friends , Castle estimates the current save rate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent figure is important to dwell on for a moment , because , judging from what I know of the animal-rescue movement , it 's both an ambitious goal and a realistic one . A 100 percent no-kill rate would be terrible for cats and dogs , because some inevitably arrive to shelters ill enough or badly injured enough to make euthanasia the kindest and most ethical alternative . <p> But euthanasia , meaning " good death , " is n't the right term to apply to most shelter deaths for dogs and cats , which are killed because good homes ca n't be found for them . That 's where the new national push comes in . <p> In our conversation , Castle cited what he called the " cause cooperation model " as key to the new initiative . " A major part of our strategy , " he said , " is to lead coalitions of organizations , so that the effectiveness of the animal welfare community within a particular area is maximized . " <p> Los Angeles is a good example of a city whose no-kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a model . New York City is another , as we 'll see in a moment . <p> I asked Castle , what specifically is going to get the national rate up to 90 percent ? He cited several action areas : <p> -- Reducing the number of cats and dogs going into the shelters in the first place , primarily through spay-neuter programs . <p> -- Intensive caring of kittens born to feral , community cats and brought into shelters by concerned people or animal control officers . These kittens need , in addition to spay-neuter and vaccination services , to be bottle-fed and socialized so that they 're suitable for adoption . <p> -- Working to overturn what Castle calls " the undeserved reputation of pit bull terrier type dogs " for aggression and " showing them as the great pets they can be . " <p> The soon-to-open adoption center in New York City will model all these efforts . Its kitten nursery , for instance , will be viewable through a glass wall to visitors , including potential adopters . <p> Risa Weinstock is president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACC , which across its five facilities takes in about 30,000 cats and dogs annually in its mission to end animal homelessness in New York City . Weinstock is on the front lines of the animal-shelter system , as her 2015 description of ACC 's scope makes clear : <p> " We are the only organization in NYC that accepts every animal brought to it , whether the animal has been abandoned , surrendered , found as a stray , brought in by the public , NYPD , or our field rescue team , and regardless of age , health status , breed , species or condition . " <p> I asked Weinstock by email about the feasibility of the nation going 90 percent no-kill by 2025 for shelter dogs and cats . Her answer ( reported here in part ) highlights both the goal 's importance , and equally , how critical it is to think beyond adoption alone : <p> " The goal of adopting/placing every healthy and treatable dog and cat is widely accepted as a best practice in animal welfare . ACC 's placement rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of February 2017 , but as with all open admissions shelters , that number can swing dramatically depending on animal intake , facility constraints and financial resources . <p> Certainly placement/adoption of dogs and cats is part of our strategy to end animal homelessness and to that end we work with Best Friends along with over 300 adoption partners . However , adoptions alone wo n't solve the problem of animal homelessness . <p> It is not just about reducing euthanasia by increasing adoptions ; the only way to effect real change is to address its root causes and what drives our intake of 35,000 animals annually . ACC has incorporated programs that not only advance adoptions , we have also added programs that help families and their pets stay together ; target low-income areas where many strays are born ; and provide surrender prevention community outreach like food pantries , behavior counseling , low cost medical referrals and vouchers , and vaccine clinics to keep the community healthier and safer . It is our collective progress that should be the ultimate barometer of the work we do on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my conversations with Castle and Weinstock , I realized that two things can be true at once . <p> Reaching for a quantitative goal " the 90 percent national no-kill status in this case " can be exciting and empowering . It gives everyone a target to shoot for and steps to track along the way . It 's important and deserves our full support . <p> Yet the very term " no kill " can be a fraught one , because it brings a laser-beam focus to the question of which animals remain alive . <p> That 's an extremely worthy focus , as I have noted . At the same time , quantity of lives saved without assurance of quality of those lives means very little . <p> Best Friends Animal Society and its organizational partners ' commitment to bothquantity and quality of animal lives are at the heart of this story . The individuals who work hard and creatively to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of cats and dogs at and beyond the point of adoption make all the difference . <p> What good " measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve for its cats and dogs over the next eight years ? <p> We 're about to find out . <p> Barbara J.

@@37206798 @6206798/ <h> Why Reality Is Not A Video Game " And Why It Matters <p> Last week , Adam Gopnik of The New Yorker published a satirical essay , in which he wondered whether the strange reality we live in could be some kind of computer game played by an advanced intelligence ( us in the future or alien ) . <p> His point was that if it is , the " programmers " are messing up , given the absurdity of current events : the incredible faux-pas at the Oscars , where the wrong best picture was announced ; Donald Trump , the most outsider president ever elected in U.S. history ; the strange comeback by the New England Patriots at the Super Bowl . These events , claims Gopnik , are not just weird ; they point to a glitch in the " Matrix , " the program that runs us all . <p> For most people trying to make a living , pay bills or fighting an illness , to spend time considering that our reality is not the " real thing " but actually a highly-sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish smart people would focus on real world problems and not on this nonsense . " I confess that despite being a scientist that uses simulations in my research , I tend to sympathize with this . To blame the current mess on powers beyond us sounds like a major cop out . It 's like the older brother framing the younger one for the broken window . " He threw the ball ! " Not our fault , not our responsibility , " they " are doing this to us . <p> Of course , philosophers consider such questions because they are interesting and raise points about the nature of reality and our perception of it . The Are We Living in a Simulation ? question comes from a 2003 paper by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom , who reasoned , compellingly , that given our own proficiency with computers and virtual reality , one of the following propositions must be true : <p> the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a " posthuman " stage ; <p> any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ( or variations thereof ) ; <p> we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation . <p> In other words , either we disappear , or our successors do or do n't run simulations , including the one we are part of today . Bostrom 's point is that if our species moves on to a new , posthuman phase , our " new us " will have unimaginable computation powers , and running realistic simulations will be a given . If this is the case , we would be like characters in a super-advanced Sims game , believing we have autonomy when , in fact , we are puppets in the hands of the game-players . <p> This sounds like a very Calvinist kind of situation , with God substituted by super-advanced game players . Or maybe we can call them Super Advanced Gaming Entities ( S.A.G.E. ) ? Our fates are in the hands of " posthuman " entities with powers beyond our control . The key difference between God and a simulation ( at least in this narrow context ) is that God is presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitches . <p> The one glitch in the simulation argument is that there is nothing to stop the simulation at one super-advanced posthuman ( alien ) species . It could very well be that our simulators are , for their part , simulated by even more advanced simulators , and those by even more advanced ones , ad infinitum . Who is the first simulator ? This reminds me of the " turtles all the way down " concept of Anavastha in Indian philosophy , where the world rests on an elephant that rests on a turtle that rests on a turtle that ... In the West , it may be interpreted as infinite regression or the problem of the First Cause . ( For a history of the " turtles all the way down " concept and its many occurrences and variations see here . ) <p> This offers at least some sort of comfort , given that we all seem to be enslaved in an endless nested web of simulators . Only the first simulator is truly free . Familiar ? <p> For Bostrom 's argument to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in simulating their ancestors ( in this case , us ) . Why would they , exactly ? Would they expect to gain some new information about their reality by looking at their evolutionary past ? <p> It seems to me that being so advanced they would have collected enough knowledge about their past to have little interest in this kind of simulation . Forward-looking may be much more interesting to them . They may have virtual-reality museums , where they could go and experience the lives and tribulations of their ancestors . But a full-fledged , resource-consuming simulation of an entire universe ? Sounds like a colossal waste of time . <p> The simulation argument messes with our self-esteem , since it assumes that we have no free will , that we are just deluded puppets thinking we are free to make choices . To believe this is to give up our sense of autonomy : after all , if it 's all a big game that we ca n't control , why bother ? This is the danger with this kind of philosophical argument , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that we end up abdicating our right to fight for what we believe in . <p> Let us make sure that we do n't confuse philosophical arguments with our very real socio-political reality , especially not now .

@@37206804 @6206804/ <h> The Good And Goofy ' Great News ' Comes To NBC <p> The first thing you may notice about Great News , a comedy premiering Tuesday night on NBC , is its similarities to 30 Rock . Here , a news producer named Katie ( Briga Heelan ) has her work life disrupted when her boss ( Adam Campbell ) hires her loving but overbearing mom ( the great Andrea Martin , late of SCTV and truckloads of comedy since then ) as an intern at the station . And while the focus is news rather than late night , the frustrated goofball at the center of a constantly careening television production has a familiar tone . A few episodes in , Katie even high-fives herself . <p> From a genetic perspective , the similarities make some sense . Great News was created by Tracey Wigfield , who 's written for 30 Rock and The Mindy Project , and it 's executive produced by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock . That makes it Fey and Carlock 's EP follow-up to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , their follow-up to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mom is her Tracy Jordan " the unstoppable force that suddenly upends an already delicate work environment " then her Jenna Maroney is Portia ( Nicole Richie ) ( ! ) , the brazenly needy and overconfident co-anchor who constantly frustrates Chuck , the puffed-up anchor ( John Michael Higgins ) at the center of the show . Admittedly , the entire cast does n't map that neatly , but when you hear the music from Jeff Richmond and Giancarlo Vulcano " who also scored 30 Rock and Kimmy Schmidt " you 'd be forgiven for thinking you 're back in Liz Lemon World . And that 's not a bad thing at all . <p> A side note : it 's interesting to ponder that NBC originally had Kimmy Schmidt and apparently agreed to let it go , which is how it wound up on Netflix . Perhaps its success encouraged the network to have confidence in Fey and Carlock again . <p> Like 30 Rock , Great News is a joke-based comedy . That might seem self-evident , but it 's not , really .

It 's the kind of comedy with jokes in it . <p> Over the first five episodes , Great News gets more sure-footed and funnier . It was smart of NBC to send out the whole ten-episode run , because comedies take time to settle . ( I 've seen six . ) It can be a little uneven early on , and it would be great for Martin to play more than Carol 's overbearing love and enthusiasm .

He is a co-chair of the Project Rural Practice Task Force in South Dakota . He is former president of the state bar . He joins us by phone from his office in Rapid City . Welcome , Patrick Goetzinger , to the program . <p> PATRICK GOETZINGER : Thank you very much , John , happy to be here . <p> DONVAN : So Patrick , as I just outlined , you 've got a state with a lawyer shortage , and you 've come up with a plan to lure attorneys into the state . Has it worked ? Can you give us an example ? <p> GOETZINGER : Well , let me just give you a little bit of background , John . South Dakota in general does n't have a lawyer shortage . What we have is an allocation of lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Main Street rural towns that are the cross-section of South Dakota . <p> And we 've developed a program called Project Rural Practice to address the need of recruiting lawyers to Main Street in rural South Dakota . And the highlight of that plan is the Rural Lawyer Recruitment Bill that was recently passed by the South Dakota legislature , which provides an economic incentive to lawyers relocating to a rural community and qualifies under this legislation for that subsidy . <p> DONVAN : So Patrick , pick a guy , you do n't have to name him , or you can use initials , first name , however you want to do , but pick a guy or woman who said yes , and profile that person for us and the decision-making process . <p> GOETZINGER : Well , the legislation was just passed this last month . It wo n't be effective until July 1 of 2013 . So we ca n't point to a success with regard to this legislation . But we can point to other successes as a result of what Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eric decided to open up a law practice in small town eastern South Dakota as a result of the things that he learned about what the State Bar of South Dakota , the local community that he relocated to or located to , was able to offer him by way of support in the form of resources through the American Bar Association , through our state bar , through our law school , as well as what incentives , both economic and non-economic , the local community could offer Eric as a result of opening up a shop in Main Street eastern South Dakota . <p> The thought process for Eric was : What barriers do I need to overcome ? <p> DONVAN : What were they ? <p> GOETZINGER : Well , they were finding an office space , creating a budget for his law practice , finding clients and having the support of established lawyers , veteran lawyers , as mentors to assist him in the myriad of decisions , from law office practice management , to how do I deal with my first divorce , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact there 's a shortage of lawyers in those rural areas , and I take your point that the cities have lawyers , we 're talking about non-city areas , how does a new lawyer get mentored if there are no older lawyers around to kind of show him the ropes ? <p> GOETZINGER : Well , we have technology available to us to help bridge that gap . We have a mentorship program through our Young Lawyers Association that will provide mentors on a daily basis and an as-needed basis . They 're just a phone call , an email or just a short ride away in a lot of cases from where that young lawyer has set up shop . <p> So the mentorship side of it does n't require you to be physically present given the technology that we have available , and the Internet is a great equalizer to allow us to provide those resources both online , on the phone , through the email , to that young lawyer . <p> DONVAN : Did you find that in the case of Eric , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it work ? He was a guy who wanted that kind of community setting , and he was looking to get the problems taken out of the way ? Or was he a guy who never would have thought about it , and you kind of needed to show him it can be pretty good ? <p> GOETZINGER : I think Eric falls into the first category , where he wanted to make that rural practice work . He was a small-town individual , came from a small town , and he had a lot of questions and a lot of concern about what it would take to establish a law practice in a small town as a solo practitioner hanging out their shingle . <p> DONVAN : All right , so let me jump to the guy who - or woman who is from the big city and never gave it a thought . Do you have any hope of and interest in bringing that sort of person in ? <p> GOETZINGER : We do , and the hope lies in the fact that we 've received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that live in an urban area that are looking to relocate to the more peaceful , quiet life that they associate with a rural area . And we 've got several folks that have contacted us , that have looked at our website , that have explored the opportunity and are going through the decision-making process of what will it take to get that individual to the rural area . <p> And so we 're providing them the nudges both through the profession , the state bar , the law school , the ABA , and the resources we can provide there , and we 're also working with our local communities , our county , our school district associations , our municipalities , our economic development arms , for the rural community to provide the incentive at the local level to get that individual to that community . <p> DONVAN : All right , Patrick Goetzinger is co-chair of the Project Rural Practice Task Force ; he is former president of the South Dakota State Bar and joined us from the phone by his office in Rapid City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining us on TALK OF THE NATION . <p> We 're looking also to hear your stories . We 're going to have some other experts reflect on your experiences , and I want to go first to a caller with a story to tell . Let 's go to Rod(ph) in St. Francisville , Louisiana . Hi , Rod , you 're on TALK OF THE NATION . <p> ROD : Hey John , thanks for having me on . <p> DONVAN : So what happened ? <p> ROD : Well , I was born and raised in St. Francisville in the ' 70s . I came up here in the ' 80s . And I could n't wait to get out of here . I - a small town was too small for me , to hold me . My sister Ruthie stayed behind and taught in the local school , married her high school sweetheart . I was happy for her , but that was n't my life . <p> I went on to a journalism career on the East Coast , in D.C. , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got cancer at the age of 40 , in 2010 , and she had never smoked a day in her life , but she had terminal lung cancer . And the things I saw from afar when she was suffering completely changed my heart . <p> I saw that the social bonds , the tight community bonds that had held me down and held me back when I was a teenager , were the only things holding my family together through my sister 's suffering . And after she died , my wife and I said , you know what , we need to be part of this community . <p> DONVAN : Really ? <p> ROD : And so we moved from Philadelphia to St. Francisville , and I ... <p> DONVAN : So there was something in that community that was not available in the big city that you valued very highly ? <p> ROD : Yeah , community . And I 'll tell you , we - the things we loved about the big city - New York , Dallas , Philly , everywhere we lived - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bookstores . But what we did n't have was community , not like they do and we do in St. Francisville . And medical care was part of it . <p> My sister 's doctor here in town was a guy named Dr. Tim Lindsay(ph) , and he treated her like a member of the family . We wanted him to be our doctor too . We wanted to have that kind of intimate medical care , which is common in this little town . <p> DONVAN : Rod , let me stop you for just a second because I want to bring in Maria Kefalas , who is a professor of sociology at St. Joseph 's University , and she wrote a book called " Hollowing Out the Middle : The Rural Brain Drain and What It Means for America . " And she 's right now standing by at station WXPN in Philadelphia . Maria , hi , welcome to the program . <p> GOETZINGER : Thank you for having me , John . <p> DONVAN : So just listening to what Rod said , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think maybe as the program launches , that it 's hard to sell small town life because of - exactly as Rod just said , the lack amenities , the sense of maybe you 're in the middle of nowhere . Yet he just put his finger on something really appealing and valuable to him in small town life . So why does n't that weigh more often ? Why is there a brain drain when in fact ... <p> MARIA KEFALAS : Well , because education creates mobility , and so small towns are really good at educating their children , and they really foster a culture of you need to leave here and succeed . And so that 's part of their mission . They 're really good at raising children to be successes other places . That 's something that they accept and really - and celebrate . <p> Unfortunately , it 's been kind of - the result over the last several decades has been community suicide , where they 're basically exporting their most academically strong children , and the kids who stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a high-school-level education . <p> In the town we wrote about in " Hollowing Out the Middle , " not one single kid who had dropped out of high school ever left that county , whereas about 60 percent of the young people who had graduated from the University of Iowa would eventually leave the state . And so - I mean education creates mobility . <p> DONVAN : I wanted , before we go to the break , just take one more drop back in with Rod . What Maria just pointed out , that in a sense you were educated to get out of town , if you 're going to be a success you have to leave town , was that your experience ? <p> ROD : That was my experience . But the thing I did not realize until I got to the middle of my life , I 'm 46 , and saw suffering , I did n't - my sister 's suffering , I never really thought about what would happen to me if I got cancer . Well , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job , but your insurance company is not going to come sit by the bed and pray with you when you 're too sick to get out of bed . <p> Your insurance company is not going to go pick your kids up from school or take them to school when you 're too sick to do that . Only your family and your neighbors will do that , and I found that I needed that in my life . And I ended up writing a book called " The Little Way of Ruthie Leming " about my experience . And I think a lot of people will relate to it . <p> DONVAN : Rod , did your friends back in Philadelphia , your big city friends , think you were crazy to go back to a little town ? <p> ROD : Interestingly enough , John , I thought that they would , but some of them actually got kind of teary about it , saying I wish I had a town like that to go back to , but I do n't because my parents moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots . I 'm really blessed to have this town to come home to , and I 'm blessed that we have the Internet ... <p> DONVAN : Rod , I apologize for interrupting because you were saying something that was very truthful to you , and thank you for sharing that with us . We 're going to continue this conversation . Maria Kefalas is going to stay with us , and we want to hear more of your stories , and particularly people who have gone back , like Rod . What got you to go back ? So stay with us . This is TALK OF THE NATION , from NPR News . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC ) <p> DONVAN : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News . I 'm John Donvan . Maine is the state with the highest percentage of the population living in rural areas , more than 60 percent according to the census numbers . The District of Columbia , of course , has the lowest : zero . California comes next with just about five percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today we 're talking about some of the efforts of rural areas to slow down its brain drain among doctors and lawyers and other professions . So we 're curious to know what works in stopping the brain drain . So if you are somebody who has decided to move to a rural area , we want to know what swayed you to do so . Our number is 800-989-8255 . Our email address is talk@npr.org . <p> Our guest is Maria Kefalas . She wrote the book " Hollowing Out the Middle : The Rural Brain Drain and What It Means for America . " And Maria , before the break you shared with us some of your thinking on why people are leaving these communities . But I 'd like you to take a minute to talk about the impact . <p> You know , we started the conversation this afternoon by talking about South Dakota having problems with lawyers going to rural areas . And I 'll be honest , it struck me as not a huge problem , but now I think I 'm wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers ? <p> KEFALAS : Oh , a community without lawyers can not do divorces , they can not do probate , they can not manage business transactions , and I think even more critically for many decades we 've been seeing the impact of no physicians and no doctors . Right now in Iowa they 've been piloting e-mergency rooms , where they staff , you know , hospitals that no longer have doctors with nurses , who then use Cisco technologies to basically triage these patients who comes into these hospitals , and doctors examine them by looking at them through computer networks . <p> It is really devastating , and towns will die . It 's part of the process of the death of the community . I do n't think the absence of lawyers kills communities , but it 's one of the symptoms , and - yeah . <p> DONVAN : You know , it occurs to me that people may kind of routinely criticize both the medical profession and the legal profession , and they do , but at the same time , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and large , that doctors and lawyers were in some sense pillars of the community , they represented - go ahead . <p> KEFALAS : Oh no , I 'm sorry , absolutely , absolutely , and really we start to see this shift in the mid-20th century , where there 's an equal kind of split between the small population of college-educated people , that they 're as likely to live in a rural area as an urban area . By the mid-20th century , that really shifts , and certainly in the ' 80s we start seeing the rise of the so-called creative class . <p> And Chicago and the Twin Cities boomed because all over the Great Plains and the Dakotas , they were exporting these kids in huge numbers . And so Austin boomed , and the Twin Cities , and Chicago boomed , and Boston boomed . But it was because they were sending talented , educated kids outside the rural regions into urban areas . And it 's a very powerful economic reality that pushes young people to do this . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never seen one work . I 've seen everything from current Secretary Vilsack , when he was governor of Iowa , he went on the walking tour of Iowa , where he tried to host - he went and hosted cocktail parties in D.C. and New York and tried to recruit University of Iowa alums to come back . And I think they enjoyed the free Merlot , but they did n't come back to Iowa . <p> DONVAN : Do you know why ? <p> KEFALAS : Well because it was - the reasons young people come back are mostly emotional , just like the previous guest talked about . They fall in love , or they - they make a decision to give up the big-city incomes , the big-city life , and they make a conscious decision to start a life in their rural communities , maybe where they have connections to , usually . And - yeah , go ahead . <p> DONVAN : Maria , the reason I want to stop at this point is because we 're right now talking about programs not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is program director at the Wisconsin Rural Physician Residency Assistance Program . Byron joins us by phone from his office there . Byron , welcome to the program . <p> BYRON CROUSE : Thank you very much , John , appreciate the opportunity to share some perspectives with you also . <p> DONVAN : Do you have success stories ? I know your focus is on bringing doctors to rural areas . Do you have successes ? <p> CROUSE : We do , and I would have to agree with some of the comments that Maria was making also about the impacts that health and the health system has on a rural community . Often we see our providers in the health system being if not the leading , it 's the second- or third-leading economic engine in these communities . And if you have a community that is paying into the health insurance , but that health care is being delivered elsewhere , those are monies that are leaving that community . <p> If you have physicians in the area , they draw and increase the vibrancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplier effect ( unintelligible ) very vibrant . So what we 've been looking at in Wisconsin is trying to identify and select those students with the greatest propensity to return to the rural communities and continue to nurture that rural interest during their medical education , both in medical school and residency . <p> DONVAN : How do you do that ? <p> CROUSE : We have programs that really have taken - kind of tracks where the students - we identify students from rural communities , with commitment to rural communities , with engagement in rural communities . So there 's an admissions process that brings the right people in , into the education programming . <p> And then we keep them in the rural communities for rotations , developing the strength in the rural communities for educational opportunities so they get back to the rural communities during their education . <p> DONVAN : Byron , one of the thing - again , this may just be my pre-judging the situation , but I 'm assuming when you 're fishing for these students , maybe you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appealing to students to come to rural areas , are you looking for family doctors and internists , you know , doctors who can handle a wide range of medical challenges , or are you actually looking for , you know , the guy who just does knee surgeries or extreme specialists ? <p> CROUSE : Excellent question because , I mean , traditionally when we are looking at rural areas , there is no question the demand , the greatest demand in a rural community in Wisconsin and throughout this country is in primary care and family medicine . But as I talk with our hospitals and clinics throughout the rural regions nationwide , you know , they quickly point out but we also need our general surgeons . We need radiology . We need the support of all specialties . But the greatest demand is in primary care . <p> Another question that I commonly get is : What 's the difference between the general surgeon or the radiologist in rural versus urban areas ? And you hit the right word , you know , the breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they need to be practicing the full scope of that practice and not just a limited , partial , like a component of their various specialty . So we need all areas . <p> But what we 've found is we bring students in that have a commitment and an engagement in the community , keep them in those areas during the training , and they return to those areas . <p> DONVAN : Do you have enough ? <p> CROUSE : We 're still trying to grow that . You know , unfortunately we 're starting in a deficit . You know , as we speak today , we 're dealing with , in Wisconsin alone , probably 150 to 200 physicians in our rural areas that we could place today . If we could bring a busload in , we 'd be able to place those people . And with a projected growth of the elderly population , the expansion with the Accountable Care Organizations , rather the ACA for increased insurance , that demand is going to increase . And so we have an uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be growing . <p> DONVAN : Byron , I want to bring some more of our listeners in . I want to go to Rick(ph) in Brookings , South Dakota . Hi Rick , you 're on TALK OF THE NATION , and tell us about Brookings . Is it rural ? <p> RICK : Hi , thanks for taking my call . The gentleman from Wisconsin is right on the mark . The need is fulfilled when you bring kids from those areas to med school and train them so that they can - they 're going to be the ones to go back . You 're just not going to bring the big-city ever out to De Smet and Arlington and , you know , Chamberlain . <p> DONVAN : You think that 's just a lost cause , that that 's just not going to be your pool of ... <p> RICK : It should n't be because the quality of life here is fabulous , and the opportunity to practice the kind of medicine you want to practice is wonderful here . <p> DONVAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a general internist , yeah , outpatient and hospital general internist . And , you know , I even have an NPR television show . You can do almost anything when you 're from a rural area and make it happen . I 'm on South Dakota Public Broadcasting on Thursday nights . <p> DONVAN : So Rick , you may not have asked me - I just asked you to take a sentence or two before to tell us about Brookings . Are you out in a rural area right now ? <p> RICK : Well , Brookings is an SPSU , the home of the South Dakota Jackrabbits . But it 's less than 20,000 without the college . And it is a - And I 'm from De Smet , a little town on the prairie , home of Laura Ingalls Wilder . This is the area of the country where there 's great pheasant hunting , great fishing , and it 's rural . It 's rural South Dakota . <p> We take care of the farmers and the people of the prairie here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria , we 've been talking for the last few minutes about the medical model , and is the medical profession a little bit ahead of everybody else , certainly ahead of the lawyers in this effort to bring people into rural communities ? <p> KEFALAS : I do n't think so . I think that they just had - they 've been dealing with it for decades , and I think that they are now reaching a real tipping point where I think - I work in communities in Iowa where the existence of the hospital and the threats to the hospital shutting down were absolutely viewed as the end of the community . So people are really trying to figure out a way to deal with this problem as the populations age and as the - as I think we reach a new level of crisis in terms of care . <p> I think the lawyers are new , but they 're probably going to have the same kind of challenges . And my concern about doing this , it 's really hard to do , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really emotional and very private issues . And it 's ... <p> DONVAN : Yeah . I feel like that 's what we 're hearing so far . <p> KEFALAS : Yeah . <p> DONVAN : And people who say they 've gone back , they had a connection . It 's not that some package of incentives made some big city slicker change his mind . I 'm going to go live in a rural - small town . It 's either there - it sounds like it 's either in you , or it 's not . <p> KEFALAS : Yeah . And actually , the - I think that it 's wonderful to do , and I think there 's maybe one way to do it . One way to do it would be to really relieve the debt burdens that students are carrying and use that as , in a way , to incent them in . So these young doctors are graduating from medical school with huge debt , and that would be a way to maybe get - turn their heads . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking - the only source of population that I can point to that definitively transforms communities and deals with these issues are immigrants . So recruiting highly educated immigrants , which is what actually many states have tried to do quietly before - you know , there were huge battles internally over this - was to bring in immigrant professionals . <p> And that may not work with lawyers , who have to go through an American university , but certainly that has been the case with medical personnel . So I think you want to do a multipronged approach of going after your own young people and really courting them , as Wisconsin 's doing , to try to get them back , understanding that it 's going to be an uphill battle a lot of the time . <p> And the second part of that is really looking at immigrants , because I can point to lots of communities in the United States , rural communities that have exploded with the arrival of immigrants . But it takes national policy and federal immigration reform for that to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their secret weapon , but it 's a nuclear option . It 's very unstable . It 's hard to do , too . But it does work . <p> NICOLE : Well , I - I 'm a teacher in a small town in southern Pennsylvania . My husband and I are both teachers , and we 're actually getting ready to move from our small town where I was born and raised and my whole family is located to a more urban area , because there are no jobs in our area right now . <p> We each drive 50 minutes to work a different way , and the pay scale is very low . We do n't get reimbursed for our master 's degrees , which we 're required to get continuing education . So , unfortunately , for us , economically , we just ca n't survive in my town anymore , so we 're leaving our family and packing up our kids and moving . <p> DONVAN : And you 're doing so with regret . <p> NICOLE : With - yes . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my entire family lives in this area . I went to school there . It 's a beautiful area . It 's close to a lot of things . But I will never pay back my student loans if I continued to work in this area , driving 50 minutes to my job . And there 's no way - there 's no upward mobility for me as far as my profession goes . There 's no way for me to develop professionally in my town . <p> DONVAN : All right , Nicole . Thanks very much for sharing your story , which ... <p> NICOLE : Thanks for taking - thank you . <p> DONVAN : Yeah , you really got the sentence for us on what the disincentives are . <p> CROUSE : John , I would like to emphasize , I think the point that our last caller just made , I think , is a real important one , too . We need to differentiate between recruitment and retention into our rural areas . Money will bring people in . It will keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in the health care area , retention is really critical in terms of the continuity of care , the continuity and the engagement with patients over time , particularly when we 're dealing with populations now that have more chronic disease and need that long - longer-term , sustained relationship with their providers . <p> Maria kind of talked about , you know , some of the issues with the international providers , health care providers being used as a source to help with rural areas . And , indeed , a program called the J-1 Visa Waiver Program helped keep international graduates of the training programs in rural and underserved areas . <p> But there 's a lot of national and international pressure kind of talking about we 're just training - addressing our rural brain drain with now a global brain drain , as we are depleting other nations and Third World countries of their workforce needs and providers . <p> Work out of Pennsylvania with Howard Rabinowitz and others have really looked at programs such as we 're doing here in Wisconsin with our WRPRAP program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're doing in Pennsylvania and other areas - even though they take a small percentage of the total medical school class size - make a significant impact on the workforce in rural areas with providers , and have a better retention rate in those areas when they get people that really engage in the community rather than never really quite fit in . <p> And once their obligation - whether it be financial or other visa-driven obligations - end , they then leave that community , and you have this cyclic turnover of providers that also , you know , leads to a deterioration of the confidence and quality in the health care system in a rural area . <p> DONVAN : And , Maria , you title your book " Hollowing Out the Middle . " And is that the trend ? In fact , is the hollowing continuing ? <p> KEFALAS : Oh , yes . And I think that - it 's been interesting , though , in Iowa that has sort of been reclaimed recently as the Silicon Prairie . They have been , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take advantage of their labor force . And Iowa always kind of reminds me of Ireland in the old EU and the Celtic Tiger in the fact that they have an excellent labor force in their educated young people . Their - even their kids with high school diplomas in community college degrees have really great skills , and they 've been really very savvy about connecting community college programs to existing need . And one of the other ways to go about this , as well , is community college students remain . <p> And one of the things I 've often talked about is that when your community college students are your population mostly likely to stay , looking at ways to use those community colleges to train medical professionals - not , obviously , going to be MDs , but physician 's assistants and nurses that can , with training and expanded roles , take on a lot of the responsibilities held by conventional doctors . And we 're seeing that in urban centers like Philadelphia . People go in for very complex procedures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONVAN : Well , there 's ... <p> KEFALAS : So I think that 's also a potential because our - the community college kids do remain . <p> DONVAN : Thanks very , very much .

@@37206806 @6206806/ <p> A prominent Muslim leader in Nigeria is making a point about a common practice in Islam . He says if people are worried about poverty or terrorism , they should consider how those problems can be made worse by polygamy . Here 's NPR 's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton . <p> OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON , BYLINE : Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II , the Emir of Kano , is Nigeria 's second-most influential Islamic leader and a former bow tie-wearing , whistle-blowing governor of the Central Bank . He addressed a gathering on Sunday about proposed wide ranging changes to family law in Kano , Nigeria 's biggest Muslim state and one of nine governed by Islamic law . Islam permits polygamy only if a man can provide for all members of his family . The Emir seems to suggest the state should enforce that . Those of us in the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria , he said , have all seen the economic consequences of men who are not capable of maintaining one wife marrying four . <p> They end up producing 20 children , not educating them , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thugs and terrorists . The Emir 's utterances were taken to mean these youngsters become prime targets ripe for recruitment by Boko Haram . The extremist network has wreaked havoc in northeastern Nigeria these past seven years killing thousands of people , abducting thousands more boys and girls and recruiting often impoverished young men into their ranks . Perhaps sensing a potential backlash , a spokesman for the Emir has since stressed there 's no provision in the proposed bill seeking to ban polygamy among poor men as it appears the Emir 's comments have been interpreted . <p> The Emir said the draft bill would address what Islam says on marriage , outlawing forced marriages and domestic violence and placing conditions that must be fulfilled before a man can marry more than one wife .

The new film " Wonder Woman , " directed by Patty Jenkins , earned over a hundred million dollars in its opening weekend , setting a new opening weekend box office record for films by a woman director . Wonder Woman is the most popular female comic book hero of all time . And she has a secret past that 's revealed in the book , " The Secret History Of Wonder Woman " by our guest , Jill Lepore . It 's now out in paperback . <p> The creator of Wonder Woman , William Moulton Marston , led a secret life with his wife and his mistress . He fathered children with each of them , and they all lived together . His vision for Wonder Woman reflected his interest in the women 's suffrage movement and in Margaret Sanger , the birth control and women 's rights activist who was also his mistress 's aunt . Wonder Woman 's costume was inspired by his intense interest in erotic pinup art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history when she found the Marston-Sanger connection while researching two seemingly unrelated subjects - a legal story involving the lie detector , which was invented by Marston , and a history of Planned Parenthood which focused on its founder , Margaret Sanger .

" Jill Lepore spoke to Terry in 2014 . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST ) <p> TERRY GROSS , HOST : <p> Jill Lepore , welcome back to FRESH AIR . Let me just start with a really obvious question , for people who have never read Wonder Woman and just know her as more as a metaphor ( laughter ) , just describe Wonder Woman the superhero character . <p> JILL LEPORE : Well , yeah , thanks for having me . It 's fun being here . Wonder Woman is an Amazon from an island of women who left ancient Greece to escape the enslavement of men . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane crashes on their island carrying a man . And Wonder Woman 's mother decides he needs to be brought back to where he came from because they can have no man on Paradise Island . <p> So she stitches for Wonder Woman this star-spangled costume , and Wonder Woman flies in her invisible jet with her man captive Steve Trevor - who 's a U.S. military intelligence officer - back to the United States - this is in 1941 - and comes to call herself Wonder Woman because she has superhuman powers that only Amazons have . She has bracelets that can stop bullets . She has a magic lasso , a golden lasso . Anyone she ropes has to tell the truth . And then she 's got the cool jet . <p> GROSS : So it is just amazing to me that this character is inspired in part by Margaret Sanger and the suffragists . And Margaret Sanger being the mother of the birth control movement , the person who came up with the term birth control . So how did the creator William Moulton Marston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEPORE : So it turns out , Marston has all kinds of ties to the early progressive era suffrage and feminist and birth control movements , sort of an uncanny number and complexity of ties . If you think about Wonder Woman as containing within it a great deal about the story of Marston 's own life , his ties really begin when he as a Harvard freshman in 1911 is caught up in a big controversy on campus . <p> In the fall of 1911 , the Harvard Men 's League for Women 's Suffrage invites the incredible Emmeline Pankhurst to campus to speak in Sanders Theatre , which is like the largest lecture hall on campus . And the Harvard Corporation is terrified . Women are not allowed to speak on campus , and they 've made one exception in the past . <p> And they say they 're not going to make an exception for Emmeline Pankhurst , who is scary in the sense that she and her followers in England have been doing things like chaining themselves to the gates outside 10 Downing St. and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so many decades and gotten nowhere , that any means necessary are at this point allowed . <p> So Pankhurst is banned from speaking on campus . And this is a kind of a big fracas across the country ' cause people like to take potshots at Harvard , of course . But also it 's kind of hilarious that Harvard is so terrified of this tiny little woman , Emmeline Pankhurst ( laughter ) . They prevent her from speaking on campus , and so she speaks off-campus in this kind of dancehall on Brattle Street in Harvard Square . <p> And just pay attention even to that alone , there 's so much in there that reappears in Wonder Woman 30 years later when Marston creates Wonder Woman in 1941 . He 's a grown man . He 's a sort of prominent person at that point . But one of the things that 's a defining element of Wonder Woman is that if a man binds her in chains , she loses all of her Amazonian strength . <p> And so in almost every episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - she 's chained up or she 's roped up , it 's usually chains . And then she has to break free of these chains . And that 's - Marston would always say - in order to signify her emancipation from men . But those chains are a really important part of the feminist and suffrage struggles of the 1910s that Marston was - had a kind of front row seat for . <p> GROSS : Because those women were chained up ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah because they would chain themselves - the women chained themselves to the gates outside the White House in protest . There were suffrage parades . Women would march in chains . I mean , they imported that iconography from the abolitionist campaigns of the 19th century that women had been involved in , of course , because the suffrage movement in the United States emerges out of the abolition campaign . And chains become a really important signal . <p> And women , in the wake of emancipation and in the aftermath of the Civil War , really turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about the ways in which they have not yet been fully emancipated , that they are themselves slaves . So Sanger , for instance , you know , she publishes a collection of letters from women called " Motherhood In Bondage , " which is - it 's all over the place , the rhetoric and the language of enslavement . <p> GROSS : However , we should acknowledge - and we 'll get into this in more detail later - there 's a big kind of fetishistic sexual aspect to the bondage and the chains in Wonder Woman . We 'll get to that a little later . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> GROSS : So ... <p> LEPORE : That 's just a little teaser , Terry , right there . <p> GROSS : That 's just a little teaser , yeah . <p> LEPORE : Stay tuned , the bondage is coming up . <p> GROSS : But this next thing is good enough to hold us over for a while . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> GROSS : I mean , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the creator of Wonder Woman , William Moulton Marston , lived in a menage a trois eventually . But earlier in his life , there were two women he was with . There was his wife , Sadie Elizabeth Holloway , and another woman , Olive Byrne . And Olive Byrne was Margaret Sanger 's niece . And so they were in a relationship together . He had four children by those two women , and , of course , they could n't make it public . But describe a little bit this arrangement that he had first with these two women . <p> LEPORE : So Marston married his childhood sweetheart in 1915 when they both graduated from college . He graduated from Harvard that year , and she graduated from Mount Holyoke . This is Sadie Elizabeth Holloway who becomes Betty ( ph ) Marston . And she was quite an interesting and ambitious woman , a really career-oriented woman of that generation . You know , one of the first generations of women to go to college . <p> And Marston then embarks on an academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in something of a scandal , he loses that job . And he ends up teaching at Tufts in 1925 , where he falls in love with one of his students who 's a senior there , Olive Byrne . Olive Byrne 's mother is Ethel Byrne , who is the sister of Margaret Sanger . <p> Ethel Byrne and Margaret Sanger together founded what becomes Planned Parenthood in 1916 , when they opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brooklyn . And they are immediately arrested within days of the clinic opening . An undercover policewoman comes in and asks for contraceptives , and Ethel Byrne explains how to use a pessary or a diaphragm . <p> Ethel Byrne is convicted on obscenity charges and sent to prison for a 30-day sentence . And she goes on a hunger strike . And she says , this is more important than the right to vote because women are dying every day in New York of abortions - of illegal abortions . They ca n't get contraception . And I will gladly give my life for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Margaret Sanger , who makes a deal with the governor of New York that if Ethel Byrne will never again be involved in the birth control movement , she can be pardoned and her life will be saved . And so Ethel Byrne really sort of disappears from the birth control movement at that point , much against her will . <p> Meanwhile , though , she puts a lot of hope in her daughter whom she sends to college , she sends to Tufts with money that Margaret Sanger 's new husband gives to her . So he 's paying for all of Byrne 's education . <p> Olive Byrne falls in love with Marston when he 's teaching at Tufts for a year . And he at that point has developed some pretty unconventional ideas about sex and gender that come from his work as a psychologist and from other kinds of proclivities that I think are unreachable to the historian . <p> GROSS : ( Laughter ) . <p> LEPORE : He - so he says to his wife , you know , I 've met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come live with us and we will live as a threesome , or I will leave you for her . And Holloway , who is this woman with a law degree and a master 's degree and she 's working in Washington at that time , she really wants to have a family . And she goes for this six-hour walk , and she thinks it over . <p> And if you think about the 1920s , and if you go back and read magazines from the 1920s , a lot of the same magazines that we have now , you know , the New Republic , The Nation , they all have these stories in them every other issue . What are women to do ? Can they both work and have a family ? They 're just like magazines today . It 's incredibly depressing to read magazines from the 1920s because the stories basically could be written today . <p> And Holloway 's been wondering this , too . She wants to have a family . She wants to have a career . Her husband now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she is . <p> And she decides OK , this deal will work for me because I will keep my job and this - her sort of deal back to Marston , at least as I can reconstruct it is yeah , that - this arrangement has to work for me . She 's going to raise my children . She can be your mistress , but she will raise my children . And so they decide to live together as a threesome . <p> GROSS : So they had to keep this a secret . I mean , you could n't really get away with that . <p> LEPORE : Yeah , I mean ... <p> GROSS : So what was the back story that they made up to explain Olive Byrne 's presence in the family with her children ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah , yeah . It 's this crazy bohemian thing . But they 're living in the suburbs . They live in Rye , N.Y. , in this big house in the suburbs . Well , they come up with a story , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the arrangement is either . So that 's really important . They say that Olive Byrne married a guy named William Richard in 1928 when she was in Los Angeles - they were all in Hollywood briefly - and had two kids in quick succession . And then he died . He had been gassed during the war . And unfortunately , she has no pictures of him and no stories about him . And no one should really ever ask about him because it 's too painful . <p> GROSS : So here they are , this unconventional family with this huge secret . But Marston is the inventor of the lie detector test and bills himself as somebody who can not be deceived , you know ? <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> GROSS : I guess he can find out the truth through this , you know , machine that he invented . And that 's just so bizarre . <p> LEPORE : Yeah . It 's so bizarre . I think they thought it was very funny like that putting one over on everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have this really triangular family arrangement , right ? But in the ' 30s , Olive Byrne takes a job as a staff writer for Family Circle Magazine ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> LEPORE : ... Writing advice for housewives . Like , Family Circle starts in 1932 . It 's a give-away at the grocery store . And the stories that she writes are sort of how to raise your children in the most conventional possible way . It 's just so funny . But her stories are - they all take the same form . She 's a widow with two children . And she needs advice about , you know , what to decide to do . One of her kids is always lying . And she does n't know what to do . <p> And so she goes to see the famous psychologist William Moulton Marston . And she goes to his house . Takes the train to his house . And then she walks up the hill . And she sits with him in his study . And they tease one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had a blast with - they were just pulling that - I mean , it is hilariously bizarre . <p> GROSS : So if you 're just joining us , my guest is Jill Lepore . And she 's the author of " The Secret History Of Wonder Woman . " And , boy , is that history secret and interesting ( laughter ) . And she 's also a staff writer for The New Yorker and a professor of American history at Harvard . Let 's take a short break here . Then we 'll talk some more . This is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG , us , my guest is Jill Lepore . And she 's the author of " The Secret History Of Wonder Woman . " And the book is filled with interesting things that she revealed that had been secret in the past , including the fact that William Moulton Marston , who created Wonder Woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there was a third woman who sometimes entered the story . So there was his wife Elizabeth Holloway , his mistress Olive Byrne , and another woman named Marjorie Wilkes Huntley , who kind of was in and out of the family . <p> LEPORE : She lived in the attic . I just think that 's important . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> GROSS : So what do you know about the arrangement that they had ? In addition ... <p> LEPORE : Well ... <p> GROSS : ... To like , you know , you said that , you know , Olive took care of the children while Marston 's wife fulfilled her ambition to have a career and left her children in the care of Olive , who , you know , did a lot of the parenting . But let me ask just overtly , like , what do you know about the sexual relationship they had ? <p> LEPORE : That 's a really tricky question . I - you know , three of their children survive and are still around . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow of the fourth child is around . I talked to her , too . And , you know , I do n't know that most children know what their parents do sexually . I do n't think that they knew either . They knew a lot less than most of us do . I spent some time trying to figure out what the house was like because I could n't quite - I could n't quite picture the arrangement . But the deal was , to the degree that I can , like , satisfy everybody 's curiosity . The deal is that there was a bathroom on the second floor that had a bedroom on either side of it , so they were adjoining . And one bedroom was Holloway 's and one bedroom was Olive Byrne 's . And Marston could go from bedroom to bedroom without having to enter the hallway . So he could just go through the bathroom . So the arrangements were largely veiled from the children . <p> That 's why I mention Marjorie Wilkes Huntley is in the attic . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kids - one of the kids once walked in on their dad with Olive Byrne in bed . And they told - he was told that Daddy was sick and Olive was making him feel better . I do n't know ( laughter ) if they believed that . <p> I do n't really know what they believed . I mean , they - a lot of them said up until the 1990s when finally there 's this - kind of a break in the story in the kind of family secrecy , they would say that Olive Byrne was the family housekeeper . And they told kids at school that if they were asked . The only reason they even figured anything out ever was long after Marston was dead , Olive Byrne 's son Donn married Margaret Sanger 's granddaughter , whose name was also Margaret Sanger , in 1961 . <p> And she became Margaret Sanger Marston . And she 's a pip . And she said , OK , this family is nuts . How come no one knows what the deal is with who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been living together for decades . They lived together for the rest of their lives , long after Marston died in 1947 . And she said , look , all right , I 'm going to make a deal with you people . Either you tell me what the family situation really was or you 'll never see your grandchildren again ( laughter ) . <p> Like , she just - she 's just like , I ca n't stand this . The secrecy is nuts . It 's crazy . And so ( laughter ) - and so finally sort of the beans were spilled then . <p> GROSS : Wonder Woman 's backstory has to do with Amazon culture . Marston 's mistress , Elizabeth Holloway , her favorite book in college was a collection of Sappho 's writing . And in popular culture , Sappho and Amazon culture are very , you know , entwined with the idea of lesbian culture . <p> And I 'm wondering if that 's - if you see that as a kind of secret thread in " Wonder Woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife and mistress ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah , that 's a really good question . And here , too , the empiricist in me has to say , I do n't quite know . I mean , certainly if you read the comics , there 's a whole lot of lesbianism in the comic books themselves . It 's just completely clear . And it 's one of the reasons critics opposed " Wonder Woman " and wanted " Wonder Woman " to stop being published . <p> And in 1954 , when Fredric Wertham , the psychiatrist who damns comics in his book " Seduction Of The Innocent , " writes about " Wonder Woman . " And he - his whole point is that Wonder Woman is the lesbian counterpart to Batman . Wertham thinks that Batman and Robin are lovers . And so - and he thinks comic books should be banned . <p> And Wonder Woman 's problems is that Wonder Woman is a lesbian . So there 's a lot of that going on in the comics and in how critics read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , you know , I 've asked their kids . The kids are like , oh , I do n't know . That does n't seem too plausible to me . But who knows ? I really do n't feel like as a historian I know . I mean , people have different ideas about this , right ? <p> Historians have different procedures and methods and ways to think about what we can know and what we ca n't know and what our obligations are . But my general premise is these people lived and died . Their children know them better than I do . Unless I have documentary evidence that tells me one thing or another , I 'm not confident to draw a conclusion . <p> GROSS : Let 's talk about how Marston came to create " Wonder Woman . " You know , he starts off in the entertainment industry by working in Hollywood for a while as a psychologist and consultant . And Marston thinks , what you really need is a woman superhero . Why does he think that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with the comic books , Marston says it 's their bloodcurdling masculinity that 's the problem , that they 're just too violent . It 's really the violence , but it 's also the domination . So the reason Superman looks like a fascist to some literary critics is he 's kind of a demigod but also he overpowers everybody . <p> And this is - you know , in the shadow of what 's going on in Europe , it 's very terrifying to imagine kids sort of worshipping this Ubermensch . And so he says , look , if you had a female superhero , her powers could all be about love and truth and beauty . And you could also sell your comic books better to girls . And that would be really important and great because she could show girls that they could do anything and that there would just be all these additional perks to gain if you would feature a female superhero . <p> GROSS : So he gets the green light . And he suggests that she be visually modeled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're pinups . They 're illustrations of very scantily clad young women in very seductive poses . And you have side-by-side images in your book ( laughter ) of , like , you know , Varga Girl illustrations and Wonder Woman . Can you describe some of the similarities ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah . So it was hard to track those down because I went to the stacks in Widener Library at Harvard and pulled all the issues of Esquire - the Varga Girl centerfolds appeared in Esquire in the 1940s - and paged through every issue , bound volume . And all the Varga Girls have been sliced out . ( Laughter ) You know , they 're very sexy pinup girls . And Harvard boys of the 1940s took advantage of them and brought them to their dorm rooms . So it was hard to get my hands ( laughter ) on the Varga Girls . That 's just - that 's for radio , Terry , to suggest just how hot they really were . <p> The Varga Girls are - they 're really different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think - it 's like the Betty Grable kind of bombshell . Like , these are - you know , fighter pilots are painting Betty Grable on their - sides of their planes . There 's a kind of leggy , sultry , athletic , healthy , high-heeled , perky - they 're wearing the skimpiest possible sort of swimsuit-like costumes . Their shirts are always unbuttoned . And they 're enticing . It 's a really different feel if you think about other contemporary sort of ' 30s - like , they 're not Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn . <p> DAVIES : Jill Lepore 's book " The Secret History Of Wonder Woman " is out in paperback . We 'll hear more from Lepore after a break . Also , John Powers reviews a new documentary about Cary Grant and film critic David Edelstein tells us about " My Cousin Rachel , " based on the Daphne du Maurier novel . I 'm Dave Davies and this is FRESH AIR . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF RUPERT GREGSON-WILLIAMS ' " WONDER WOMAN 'S WRATH " ) <p> DAVIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for Terry Gross . We 're listening to Terry 's interview with Jill Lepore , author of " The Secret History Of Wonder Woman . " It 's now out in paperback . Lepore tells the story of Wonder Woman 's creator , William Moulton Marston . When we left off , Lepore was telling Terry Wonder Woman 's look was inspired by Varga Girl pinups , illustrations of scantily clad young women in seductive poses . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST ) <p> GROSS : So he models Wonder Woman , in part , on the Varga Girls , which is so interesting because his conception is of this , like , empowered woman , but the way she looks is for the sexual arousal of men . <p> LEPORE : Yeah . So there 's no simple story here . There 's actually - there are a lot of people that , I think , get very upset at what Marston was doing and people who got upset at the time for reasons that people would get upset thinking about what he 's doing now - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's supposed to help girls decide to go to college and have careers or is this just , like , soft porn ? You know , it - actually , that was the question in the 1940s , too . <p> GROSS : But her image - Wonder Woman 's image was also influenced by photos and illustrations of suffragists . <p> LEPORE : Yeah . And that 's the piece that 's missing . And that 's the part that I really wanted to pay attention to and try to recover because you can look at Wonder Woman from the 1940s and you can see . It 's immediately apparent to you , the fetishism , right ? You can also immediately see the feminism , that when Wonder Woman is out - in those early stories that Marston wrote , she 's doing things like organizing working women to go on strike for equal pay with men . ( Laughter ) She 's running for president . I mean , they 're really very overtly feminist stories . But then there 's the - where she 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was important for me to think about where that came from . <p> And Harry G. Peter , who is the artist who Marston hired - specifically hired to draw Wonder Woman and really had not been involved in comics and was n't a particularly good comics illustrator , had known this woman Annie Lucasta Rogers . They were together staff artists at Judge magazine in the 19-teens , where they both worked on the suffrage page , where they do cartoons - editorial cartoons featuring suffragists . And one of the things that Lou Rogers always did was draw this sort of allegorical , iconic Amazonian-like woman breaking chains . <p> GROSS : And in terms of the storyline , Marston hired Joy Hummel to help write Wonder Woman . And Marston 's mistress , Olive , gave her one book and told her , read this and you 'll know how to write Wonder Woman . And that book was ... <p> LEPORE : Margaret Sanger 's " Woman And The New Race . " <p> GROSS : So this is just so interesting , that Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinup imagery and a book by Margaret Sanger and images of suffragists . It 's such an interesting collection of , like , thoughts and ideas and images in this one superhero . <p> LEPORE : Yeah . It 's a tangle . And it , too - and it 's - and a little bit kind of that puzzle of that - like Lady Gaga is . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> LEPORE : You know , like , when I look at Lady Gaga - and you 're like , huh , what do I think about her ? You know , that Wonder Woman looks like that to me , too . I mean , she did n't look like that when I started . But now I 'm like , oh , she 's way more complicated and rich . Like , there 's no wonder that she kind of permeates the culture and has lasted so long . There 's a lot going on there . <p> GROSS : So Wonder Woman is this mix , as we 've been saying , of kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you pointed out , in most of her adventures , she 's bound up in chains and has to liberate herself , has to free herself . So that kind of has two associations . <p> One is that , like a lot of the feminists , the suffragists used to chain themselves in protest and use chains as a symbol of their bondage . At the same time , there 's a lot of fetishism in that , too , I think , in the way that Wonder Woman is often bound up . So can you talk about that kind of , like , double level that the bondage is working on ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah . It became really controversial in the 1940s . Wonder Woman was banned partly ' cause she was so scantily dressed . But members of the editorial advisory board that - what became DC Comics - had together resigned in protest over Wonder Woman and the bondage ' cause guys - like , soldiers - there 's this really fascinating letter from a GI stationed maybe - I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like , I just love these Wonder Woman comics . I mean , I just - the chains and the heels , those boots . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> LEPORE : You 're just like , aahh while reading the letter . <p> GROSS : ( Laughter ) . <p> LEPORE : And , you know , Gaines forwards this letter to Marston . Marston says , hey . I think that 's great . I think that 's swell . Look , you know , it 's completely harmless . Like , I 'm a psychologist . I have a Ph.D . from Harvard . I will assure you this is completely harmless . I think all the more power to you . <p> Like , well , unless someone 's hurting someone , anything goes , which has actually been Marston 's big principle . This book that he writes in 1928 , " Emotions Of Normal People , " is all about - you know what ? Do n't think about your sexual behavior as abnormal , no matter what it is . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever you 're doing is normal . And you should just love yourself . <p> And it 's actually this incredibly moving thing to read . I mean , he 's really opposed to prejudice against nonconformists . And it 's a kind of odd place to exert that intellectual leadership - through a comic book . But he is , in fact , exerting it . I mean , you 've got to think carefully about what he 's trying to do there . But he 's the - he thinks all these fantasies are harmless unless anybody 's being actually harmed . ( Laughter ) <p> But DC Comics was really concerned - rightly so . And so they keep trying to find another psychologist or luminary who can tell them - is Marston right ? Like , is this actually OK , or is this not OK ? So they hired this woman Lauretta Bender , who 's a psychiatrist who runs the children 's ward at Bellevue Hospital . And they send all the Wonder Woman comic books to her . And they say , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she say ? <p> LEPORE : ( Laughter ) You see , she says , you know what ? I love Wonder Woman . She thinks it 's kind of great . She 's like , OK . Marston is a kook , and you should n't believe a word he says ( laughter ) ' cause Marston writes these letters that are just like , whoa . But she thinks comic books are like folklore . They 're like the " Grimm 's Fairy Tales . " <p> And we do n't get too concerned about Little Red Riding Hood and Big Bad Wolf . I mean , we understand that that - or , you know , now we might do a literary reading of those stories and what they tell us about famine in early modern Europe or something ( laughter ) . <p> But at the time , people thought , OK . There 's a lot of interesting symbolism in those stories . And it helps kids work out things like their fear of death . And Bender thought that it helped kids work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Marston really believed in women 's rights , and the suffrage movement was kind of formative for him - you know , he put a lot of that into Wonder Woman . But , you know , at home , he has basically two wives , a wife and a mistress . He has children with both of them . And I keep asking myself , was he being very sexist and - you know , at home by having , like , two wives , basically ? Or was this a good arrangement for the two women ? - and that , you know , his wife was able to have a career and have the mistress , you know , raise the children . What did the women think of it ? Did they see it as empowering or as , you know , a man domineering their lives and them not each having a husband to themselves ? I have a feeling you ca n't answer those questions . But just thinking about it is so interesting . I wish we could answer those questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , too . But I have two things to say . One is that when Holloway does write these letters in 1963 saying what it was like ... <p> GROSS : This is the wife . <p> LEPORE : ... She - yeah . She says , look . You know , we both loved him . And he loved us . And there was love-making for all . That 's the phrase she uses . And the kids all say it was actually a delightful way to grow up - that they were deeply loved by everybody in different ways . So I actually think that it 'd be better , really , to turn the camera . Like , we have a telescope , and we 're trying to look through the window of their bedroom , right ? It will be better to take that telescope , zoom back out and look at the larger culture and say , look . Why do people still joke - I 'm sure you have friends - heterosexual couples - who are both working and raising kids who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a wife ( laughter ) , you know , to stay home and take care of the kids . But that is actually - still remains a problem - that the basic , structural problems that are attendant on thinking about women as political actors and women as economic actors on a stage of equality with men have never yet been solved . <p> And they have actually been barely addressed . In fact , they 're put to one side by each generation . And there are all these crazy patches that are patched all on top of these problems . And so I love the family story . <p> I think it 's fascinating ( laughter ) . It 's dramatic and interesting . But I hope that what it causes people to reflect on is the duration and the stubbornness and the lack of advance in this struggle for women 's equality . <p> GROSS : And one more thing - I just think it 's so interesting that the two women , the wife and the mistress , remain living together for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . They lived together for years and years . Holly does n't die until 1993 at the age of 100 . Olive Byrne does a few years before her . But they 're inseparable . The family refers to them as the ladies . And , you know , the ladies went ( laughter ) everywhere together . They were devoted to one another . They were also devoted to the memory of Marston . But they were incredibly close . <p> GROSS : So let 's get back to the connection between Margaret Sanger and Wonder Woman . And , again , you wrote about Sanger in The New Yorker in your history of Planned Parenthood article because she founded Planned Parenthood . She started the birth-control movement . And Sanger 's niece was Marston 's mistress . Sanger 's book was one of the things that was used to create the character of Wonder Woman . <p> So in researching the story of Wonder Woman , what are some of the things you learned about Margaret Sanger that perhaps you did not know before that helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> LEPORE : Yeah . Well , it was actually - I had been working on this piece for The New Yorker about Planned Parenthood , and I was reading Sanger 's papers . And I love to read people 's oral histories ' cause there 's something different about an oral history than when you read people 's old mail . <p> And in Sanger 's papers , there 's an oral history done with Olive Byrne , who is referred to as Olive Richard in the oral history , and with Sanger 's granddaughter , Margaret Sanger Marston . And I - ( laughter ) wait a minute . The people who 've done the oral histories of Margaret Sanger are members of Marston 's family . And it just completely knocked me out . <p> And I was like - to realize that there was this tie between Wonder Woman and Margaret Sanger . So I did come to see Sanger through that lens . You see Sanger as a family member . I guess she was really close to Olive Byrne 's children . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was pretty close to her own grandchildren . <p> Both Sanger and her sister Ethel Byrne had basically abandoned their children when they were young women in order to pursue the cause of birth control . And their children never forgave them for it . But they were both utterly devoted grandmothers , which - something , really , I had never really thought about when you think about the history of the continuing struggle for birth control , right ? <p> This has been over a century since Margaret Sanger started publishing " Woman Rebel " and demanding birth control - that these women gave up their own motherhood , in a sense , to do what they did . And there 's something kind of beautiful about the way they are able to be grandmothers . But it made me think a lot about the ties across generations that are obscured in when we think about the history of women . <p> GROSS : So having deeply immersed yourself in the story of Wonder Woman and in the Wonder Woman comics , what do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a fan of them before ? Are you a fan of them now ? <p> LEPORE : No , I was never a fan . I never read comic books as a kid . I was far too much of a geek to do that . I remember watching the Lynda Carter TV show , which started in ' 75 , ' 76 , and then switching to watch " The Six Million Dollar Man " ' cause I kind of had a crush on him . <p> But I did n't - ( laughter ) you know , like , my brother watched Lynda Carter and " Wonder Woman . " I got fascinated by the story because I 'm a political historian . It seemed to me there was a really important political story that had been missed that is sort of invisible - basically , as invisible as Wonder Woman 's jet , if you just read the comic books . <p> So I do have a different appreciation for them . But I actually had an experience just recently that really carried home to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I meet tell me , oh , my God . I always loved Wonder Woman when I was a kid .

@@37206813 @6206813/ <p> Seventy-five years ago today , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order that forced 120,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans into World War II internment camps . Adrian Florido of NPR 's Code Switch team has the story of a woman , Sande Hashimoto , who recalls what happened to her and what happened to her neighborhood . <p> ADRIAN FLORIDO , BYLINE : Hashimoto and her family lived in LA 's Little Tokyo . She remembers her parents and neighbors rushing to sell off their belongings , and she remembers the day they packed their bags . <p> SANDE HASHIMOTO : And there were soldiers with rifles . And they told us all to , you know , get on the train , so we did . <p> FLORIDO : The train took them 200 miles away to the Manzanar internment camp . They lived there for more than three years . When they were released , the family moved back home , reopened their dry cleaning business . But Little Tokyo had changed . <p> HASHIMOTO : It was all black . You know , all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Japanese restaurants and shops , the businesses were now African-American . The apartments the Japanese families left behind now housed black workers . Little Tokyo even had a new name , Bronzeville . Hashimoto made her first black friend , a little girl who lived nearby . <p> HASHIMOTO : And sometimes I would go over to her place , her mother would be braiding her hair . And then as soon as she finished braiding her hair , then she says , I 'll braid yours , too . So I said , OK . <p> FLORIDO : One day , her friend moved away . And gradually , the other black residents in the neighborhood did too . <p> HASHIMOTO : The black people were there . And then all of a sudden , the Japanese-American - they were all coming out of camp - and one by one , it was Little Tokyo again . I thought maybe I was dreaming these stories where they were there and they were gone . <p> FLORIDO : But it was n't a dream . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West met me in Little Tokyo . He says after the Japanese were interned , building owners had a lot of vacant property to fill . And this coincided with the arrival of many Southern blacks who came to LA for wartime jobs . <p> CHRISTOPHER JIMENEZ Y WEST : You 're coming with very little resources , and so you 're looking for the least expensive place to stay . <p> FLORIDO : But in segregated LA , only about 5 percent of residential areas were open to blacks , including Little Tokyo . So black workers crowded in . <p> JIMENEZ Y WEST : They just got stuffed in like sardines into the community . <p> FLORIDO : The neighborhood 's population nearly quadrupled . This brought problems like overcrowding and communicable disease . Still , the community was vibrant - bars , barbecue joints , jazz clubs opened where you could see Charlie Parker perform . <p> ( SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC ) <p> FLORIDO : But just as quickly as it sprang up , after the war , Bronzeville disappeared . Martha Nakagawa is a local historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white building-owners preferred to have them come back , so sometimes they would not renew the leases of the African-American businesses . Or the Japanese-Americans would come back and buy the leases out . And so that 's how , slowly , the transition happened . <p> FLORIDO : She says this transition created both tension and efforts at solidarity . In a couple of cases , Japanese organizations sued black business owners to get property back . Other Japanese folks worked to help displaced black residents find new places to live . Today , few physical reminders of the Bronzeville era remain . There used to be a mural with Charlie Parker , but it 's been painted over . But if you 're walking in Little Tokyo and you look down , you 'll see a timeline etched into the sidewalk . The words , 1942 - Little Tokyo becomes Bronzeville , are inscribed in gold .

It got 16 nominations , it seemed like ( and was ) a lock to win many of them , and every other Tony story struggled to get a little bit of sunlight . <p> Not so this year . Yes , there are big stories : the revival of Hello , Dolly ! starring Bette Midler did very well , with 10 nominations , including ones for Midler and David Hyde Pierce as well as for Best Revival of a Musical . The new musical Natasha , Pierre And the Great Comet Of 1812 got more nominations than any other single show , with 12 , including one for its big-star lead , Josh Groban . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly . Dear Evan Hansen , a musical that 's felt to me like it has the most pop-culture juice of the season ( a purely subjective evaluation ) , has nine nominations , and the musical adaptation of Groundhog Dayand the based-on-a-true-story Come From Awayboth have seven . <p> As for plays ( which generally do n't rack up the sheer number of nominations that musicals do , because there are n't music-side awards in contention ) , the most-nominated show is A Doll 's House Part 2 , which is , yes , a contemporary follow-up to Ibsen 's A Doll 's House that imagines what Nora might be doing fifteen years after she famously walked out the door and left her husband and children behind.It received eight nominations including ones for all four of the actors in its small cast : Laurie Metcalf , Chris Cooper , Jayne Houdyshell , and Condola Rashad . <p> Nipping at its heels is Oslo , an absorbing drama about the negotiation of the Oslo Accords in 1993 that received seven nominations " my personal favorite being the one for Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces that are rolled , carried , raised and lowered by the cast to shift from scene to scene in a strikingly elegant dance that underscores the care with which the talks have to be arranged and managed . <p> A revival of August Wilson 's Jitney has six nominations , including one for director Ruben Santiago-Hudson , who ( trivia alert ! ) TV viewers may know as Castle 's Captain Roy Montgomery . <p> Oh " and on a personal note , Sweat and Indecent , the plays I wrote about earlier this spring , were both nominated for Best Play , along with Oslo and A Doll 's House Part 2 , which makes me four for four on Best Play nominees for the first time ever , to say the least . <p> It 's a curious moment for theater , from the standpoint of pop culture .

But the key word is might . <p> Look around you at a Broadway show " a play especially " and you will see an audience whose whiteness and , you know , maturity is , on the whole , evident . ( I say that as a mature white lady . No judgment . ) I have n't yet seen The Great Comet , but I 'm not sure , despite its wonderful reviews , it 's likely that the way to remedy an audience that leans older and whiter than you 'd ideally prefer is to lead with Josh Groban . ( Which is n't Josh Groban 's fault ! I 'm actually quite a fan of him as well . And you also would not lead with someone like me . Once again : no judgment . ) <p> But there 's a lot to like in these shows , and the plays , I can tell you , are deeply engaged with many of the profound questions about the state of the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oslo and A Doll 's House all , in different ways , feel as if they are " to use a tricky and squishy term " resonant . They resonate not only with direct questions of history and sociology , but with the more unsettling sensation that to live in the world is often to feel misunderstood and mistreated by people with whom you must nonetheless either find a way to live peacefully " or consign yourself to live other than peacefully . They are all plays about coexistence in various ways , and in that sense , they are all plays about compassion and empathy and the limitations of both . <p> The Tony Awards will be handed out on Sunday , June 11 .

At once the grandchild and heir of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller and a globe-trotting billionaire banker in his own right , Rockefeller also earned a reputation as a prodigious patron of the arts . <p> Rockefeller died of congestive heart failure at his home in Pocantico Hills , N.Y. , family spokesman Fraser P. Seitel confirmed to NPR . <p> In a statement released Monday , former President George W. Bush commended Rockefeller as " one of the most generous philanthropists " and brightest Points of Light " whose caring and commitment to the widest range of worthy causes touched and lifted innumerable lives . " <p> " David 's Bank " <p> At the time of his death , Forbes estimates , Rockefeller 's net worth was $3.3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime executive at Chase Manhattan Bank . For roughly two decades , according to the family 's statement , Rockefeller occupied the lofty heights of the bank 's management " serving as chairman of the board and co-chief executive beginning in 1961 and ultimately taking the reins as sole CEO in 1969 . <p> He would eventually step down from that position in 1980 , retiring entirely about a year later . <p> During that time , Rockefeller 's leadership " and internationally oriented policies " became synonymous with Chase Manhattan , an institution so shaped by his reputation and vision it was occasionally tagged with the moniker " David 's Bank . " <p> " Chase Manhattan grew from a $4.8 billion institution in 1946 when he joined to a bank with $76.2 billion in assets when he stepped down in April 1981 . But it slipped from its standing then as No. 3 in the world and was purchased by Chemical Bank of New York in 1996 . Today it is part of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co . " <p> " From 1974 to 1976 its earnings fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of America , Citibank , Manufacturers Hanover and J.P . Morgan " rose 12 to 31 percent , " the New York Times notes , adding that a scandal in the mid-1970s led the Federal Reserve and the comptroller to term Chase a " problem " bank . <p> Rockefeller took an intensive interest in foreign relations during this time " again , for better and for worse . His frequent meetings with world leaders helped Chase Manhattan " become the first American bank with operations in those countries , " says the Times . As he told NPR 's Scott Simon in 2002 , he even debated Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on the merits of capitalism in the mid-1960s . <p> " It was quite fascinating , " Rockefeller recalled . " We went at one another with strong views each on our own side , yet throughout I think we did respect one another and it was never a hostile debate . " <p> At the same time , he earned his fair share of bad press for meeting with dictators such as Iraq 's Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it was partly on the basis of his and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's urging that President Jimmy Carter allowed the deposed Shah of Iran to enter the U.S. for medical treatment in 1979 " a decision that Bloomberg reports led to " the seizure of American hostages in Tehran from 1979 to 1981 . " <p> Still , Rockefeller retained the respect of politicians from both sides of the U.S. political spectrum . As the Times reports , both Carter and President Richard Nixon asked him to serve as their Treasury secretary . He turned down both offers . <p> He " would like to be thought of as having seen that there was an important role for the private sector in world affairs and cooperating with governments for the benefit of both sides , " Rockefeller told the Times in 1995 . <p> " Other things which ... bring much greater satisfaction " <p> Despite his long tenure at the top of the banking world , Rockefeller crafted a legacy as much from his philanthropy as from his time in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up would be a remarkable understatement . In his 2002 memoir , the first such autobiography to be published by a member of his family , Rockefeller recounted a gilded youth " one in which he delivered food to the poor with the help of a chauffeur , roller-skated along Fifth Avenue tailed by a limousine in case he should grow tired , and attended dinner with a father and mother who ate every night in their formal wear . <p> But he said he also aimed to emulate aspects of his grandfather , the founder of Standard Oil " a man who " along with Andrew Carnegie , was the father of philanthropy in this country , " he told NPR " and his mother , Abby Aldrich Rockefeller , who helped found New York City 's Museum of Modern Art . <p> David Rockefeller gave away nearly $2 billion in his lifetime , Reuters reports , and in 2010 he declared he would donate even more , signing a pledge with 39 other American billionaires to give at least half their wealth to charity during their lifetimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100th birthday in 2015 , the BBC reports , he donated 1,000 acres of land to the state of Maine . <p> And he never forgot the institution his mother had a hand in creating , serving as its chairman for many years and leaving it a $100 million bequest in 2005 , according to the Times . <p> As much as he gave , Rockefeller had nearly the same propensity for collecting . At one point , his private art collection was valued at $500 million , and his famously vast collection of contacts " which the Times says had roughly 150,000 names in it " needed a whole room to house it . <p> Still , his longest-running collection was significantly less ostentatious : his beetle collection . From a young age until his death , the unlikely amateur entomologist avidly collected just about as many beetles as he could find . <p> " It 's nice to live well and eat well and own things , but there comes a time , if you have enough money , when you just ca n't enjoy them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other things which I think can bring much greater satisfaction " and that 's doing things for others .

" She says she was sexually abused for years by two priests and other men at Archbishop Keough High School in the late 1960s . More than 30 people say they were also abused by the same priest who was her main abuser . Jean Wehner believes Sister Cathy was killed for knowing too much about this abuse . <p> I talked to Jean Wehner this week . She told me how she and Sister Cathy first talked about this . And just a warning - the next seven minutes are going to be intense . <p> JEAN WEHNER : That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that was the last day of school .

And then it was found that she had been killed . The case remained unsolved . You graduated from Keough . You eventually got married . You had kids . And you basically buried the memories of your abuse . When did you start to remember ? <p> WEHNER : The pressure of it , I would say probably the beginning of 1992 . <p> MCEVERS : And one of the most intense memories you had is that - the priest who you say abused you is a man named Father Joseph Maskell - that he actually took you to see Sister Cathy 's body . Is it OK to talk about that and what happened that day ? <p> WEHNER : Sure . What I would need to say is that I had been systematically abused , manipulated , raped , conditioned by Joseph Maskell for a good year and a half before any of this with Sister Cathy happened . When you talk about being taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it would play out in a way . <p> I believed when I went into his room that he started talking to me as if she were somebody who was a close friend and he knew that I was concerned and upset that she was missing .

We 're in the car , and the man would speak nonstop like he was giving a sermon . <p> And a lot of what he would be saying is about what happens to people when they say bad things and that you really need to be a good person , and then when you 're not good - just on and on and on .

And the Archdiocese of Baltimore denied that there was any kind of cover-up . But the archdiocese has paid nearly $500,000 in settlements to 16 people who accused him of sexual abuse , and that includes you . Do you think that the killing of Sister Cathy will ever be resolved ? Do you think an answer is out there ? <p> WEHNER : I hope there is . I came to a decision quite some time ago because I was having to do so much of this on my own with the people I felt I could trust that in order to move forward I had to stop looking at who killed Cathy Cesnik ... <p> MCEVERS : Yeah . <p> WEHNER : ...

But I can be hopeful that someone will come to some kind of conclusion with what happened to Cathy Cesnik . <p> MCEVERS : So many of survivors of abuse do not fare as well as you have . Every time I was watching you , I could n't help but wondering , how have you managed to be so strong and to be so clear and to be so focused in what you 're doing , in the work that you 're doing ? <p> WEHNER : One of my coping mechanisms is looking in control and looking like I 'm really very strong . So what you see is what I want you to see . Who I am is who I need you to see me as .

I could have been a professor . I could have been a lawyer . I may have been a doctor . I 'm none of those things . But I will speak out because this is the truth . <p> MCEVERS : Jean Wehner , thank you so much for your time today and just for your bravery . We really appreciate it . <p> WEHNER : Thank you , Kelly . <p> MCEVERS : Jean Wehner now works as a life coach . " The Keepers " is out now on Netflix
