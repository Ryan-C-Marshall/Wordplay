@@90027596 @5527596/ <h> Isagenix IsaLean Shake Review : A Sugary Meal Replacement <p> Isagenix Isalean Shake Reviews are everywhere these days , but there 's only ONE Fit Life Allie Isalean Shake Review . And you 've found it . Because you 're a total rockstar . Because you know how to do good research . Because you have great skin . Because youwait . What ? Where am I going with this . Lol . But seriously . You are smart because you 've found the most informative Isagenix meal replacement shake review on the whole internet . That 's something to be proud of . That 's your crowning achievement for the day , if you 're having a day like I 'm having . AKA a very slow-moving one . But we all have them , right ? In this this review , we 're going to have some real fun . We 're also going to learn a thing or two about the best selling Isagenix product- the Isalean Shake . The first thing we 'll discuss is the taste . What 's more important than taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . So once we conclude talking about the taste , we 'll talk about looks , and then the formulation . I 'll tie all the information together at the very end with a comprehensive review summary , and then we 'll give a final review score to Isagenix Isalean Shake . And begin . <p> I 've only got forty minutes before my computer dies , so we 'll have to make this review a quickie ! Or not . honestly it 'll probably be just as long and thorough as all my protein shake reviews , I 'll just have to type and think faster ! But it 's ok . I just ate a butt-load of carbs so my brain has SO MUCH fuel . It 's so confused . You dieters know what I mean . Nothing like wandering around the office in a fog because you 've been so restricting of food that your brain literally has no gas to run on . Oh , what 's that ? You do n't have an eating disorder ? Oh . Maybe it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . But . Speaking of dieting . I scored a few samples of the Isagenix IsaLean Meal Replacement Shakes from one of the Isagenix Chicks ' in our office ( every office has one or two , you know this ) , so I decided to do a review . I 'm starting to realize that Isagenix is a monstrous company on the level of Herbalife or Advocare or Shakeology . You know . Those really big , soul-less companies that turn your friends into salesmen overnight and annoy you . Yep . But let 's hold judgement until we get a better sense for the Isagenix products . Maybe they 're super good. - <h> Isagenix Isalean Shake Flavor Grade : 8.0 <p> So I had the opportunity to try three different flavors of the Isagenix IsaLean shake- and I 'm like 90% sure that one of these three is the best flavor of Isagenix IsaLean . The three flavors that I had were the Limited Quantity Eggnog , the Creamy French Vanilla , and the Creamy Dutch Chocolate . There is also a black sesame flavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . I 'm hesitant to try either of these flavors because they sound , er , bad ? I mean . Who wants to drink a black sesame ' shake ? ? It sounds gross . But here are my thoughts on the three flavors that I DID try : - <p> Eggnog : Ok , this was not the best flavor for Isalean meal replacement shake . Was it good for the first sip ? Absolutely . Was it REALLY good for the second sip ? Sure . Was it really hard to drink the entire thing ? You bet . This shake was rich , sweet , and did have some eggnog flavor , but like real eggnog , you only need a little bit before it becomes too much ' . I would give it an 8 out of ten. - <p> Creamy French Vanilla : I think the WORST flavor of IsaLean Meal Replacement shake is the french vanilla . It 's surprising , because often times companies will invest heavily in the development of a really strong vanilla flavor- knowing that it will often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isagenix Vanilla shake is bad . French vanilla can be kind of hit or miss . It 's some sort of strange , spiced form of the vanilla that always gets me . It makes it taste almost filmy in your mouth . This flavor of Isalean was also too mild in terms of sweetness . I think they need to scrap the whole thing and start from scratch. - <p> Creamy Dutch Chocolate : NOW we 're talking the Dutch Chocolate tastes the way a protein shake SHOULD taste . I will give it a 9.4 out of ten- a pretty darn good score . This Isagenix Protein Shake is totally rich , totally decadent , and gives you everything you need on your tongue . It gives you a fantastic chocolate , first of all . The bitterness is that of 60% cacao- a nice sort of in-between ' between milk and dark chocolate . I found it to be quite pleasant . The sweetness level is on point , and even the texture is an improvement over the others . I thoroughly enjoyed this protein shake from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 7.8 <p> I know . Usually I do the formula grade after taste , but I need a little change of pace from that routine today . So we 're going to do this from the OUTSIDE in . Just like how you size up a guy in the gym . You do n't know his personality until AFTER you see that he 's 8% bodyfat and has a nice smile . Calm down , Allie . Lol . But yeah . Appearance wise , the Isalean Meal Replacement shakes are NOT 8% bodyfat . They are the equivalent of , like , a 12% bodyfat . Eh . Higher . 18% . Above average . ( What even is a normal person 's bodyfat ? ) . - <p> The container is boring and white . The lids are boring and white . The labels are mostly boring and mostly white . For some brands this works , and for some it does not . Bikinibod is one example of a brand that does well in white . But this is not Bikinibod , this is Isagenix and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They use a boring , faded strip of color as the feature graphic on each shake 's label . The product name IsaLean Shake ' is reversed out from that strip , in white . It 's not big enough . It should be bigger than the Isagenix logo. - <p> The one thing they have done an OK job of , is making the flavor easy to identify . There are large , bold graphical representations of each flavor that , if nothing else , make you more curious and excited to try these meal replacement shakes. - <p> The other thing that I do kind of like about the labeling of these protein shakes is the ittle grid of product callouts . Oddly , some flavors have this and some do not . But they are colorful and make you think that there are some features of the shake that set it apart . In reality it 's just a fun little colored box grid with product statistic on it- but I still enjoy it . Ok . Let 's talk about formulation now. - <h> Isagenix Isalean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isalean shake an 8/10 on the formulation because it 's not the best formula that I 've ever seen , and at the same time it 's not the worst . As you know from the GNC LeanShake review that I literally JUST did , you know that I 'm not the biggest fan of meal replacements . Some meal replacements are better than others , but the fact of the matter is that most meal replacement shakes are just regular protein shakes with added sugar , and sometimes a multi-vitamin component . This product does at least have that multi-vitamin component . But it also does have that added sugar . Here are the macros : - <p> Calories : 240 <p> Total Fat : 5g- <p> Sat . Fat : 1.5h <p> Cholesterol : 45mg <p> Sodium : 240mg <p> Total Carbohydrate : 24g <p> Dietary Fiber : 8g <p> Sugars : 11g <p> Protein : 24g <p> So there 's a few things to like , and a few to not like as much . 24 grams of protein is pretty good by me . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not low-impact vegan protein . Good old dairy . The thing I do n't like about Isalean from a formula perspective is the sugar , and then also the Isomaltooligosaccharide powder . This is the weird , synthetic goop found in Quest bars that make them taste good and also be mystery franken-foods . I try to avoid it because I do n't think it 's very good for your digestive system . Now . the other things to consider here are just the sheer amount of metals and preservatives and other additives that provide all the vitamin content in this Isalean shake formula . I prefer to get my micronutrients from real food- but you might be different . But when the ingredients ' list of your protein shake is like , a LONG paragraph , typically it 's not that great for you. - <h> Isagenix Isalean Shake Review Summary <p> Isagenix Isalean Shake Flavor Grade : 8.0 <p> Isagenix Isalean Shake Packaging Score : 7.8 <p> Isagenix Isalean Shake Formula Grade : 7.5 <p> Isagenix Isalean Shake Value Grade : 7.0 <p> So here 's the scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you get the chocolate . The formula is too artificial and sugary for me but the protein itself is of good quality . The kicker is the price . You have to pay over $3 per serving for these shakes , and they are just not worth that to me , all things considered. - <p> - <h> Isagenix Isalean Shake Final Review Score : 7.7 <p> Hi , my name is Allie and this blog is my hobby : ) I am passionate about being fit and active , so making a blog about my experience with different products that help me stay healthy made sense to me .

@@90027600 @5527600/ <h> It Works Fat Fighter Review : Cheap and Moderately Effective <p> The time has come for my It Works Advanced Formula Fat Fighter Review . If that sounds like a dramatic opening sentence , you are correct , it is a very dramatic sentence for a very dramatic Fat Fighter review that you are about to read . I mean are n't all my reviews kind of dramatic ? I think they are . Because I guess I 'm a bit dramatic . But hey- that means you are going to hear EXACTLY what I thought about this product . I 'm not going to sugarcoat anything or distill down my opinions . My big mouth gets me in plenty of trouble but I think my reviews are one place where my raw opinion is appreciated . So I hope you do appreciate it in this It Works review . The difficult thing with some of these fat burning supplements is that you never know how much of it is the product working and how much is a lifestyle change that you might have made . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control every possible variable so that there is nothing else that could be impacting the results that I got during my two week trial run with Fat Fighter by It Works . Before we dive in- here is what you are about to be told about Fat Fighter . ( Wow that was terrible sentence structure ) . First , we will talk talk about if It Works , well , work ! Second we will discuss the ingredients and formula of It Works . Third we will discuss labeling and packaging . If that all sounds good , keep on reading my It Works Fat Fighter Review . <p> It Works is a total lifestyle brand that makes everything from diet supplements and weight loss products to yoga mats to even , get this , a weight loss wrap that you put around your waste and it apparently has an impact on your waistline ! Now . If you read my Sweet Sweat Reviews you know that I do n't really believe in these seemingly gimmick ' products . I mean . A fat loss wrap ? ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to grab some of It Works Fat Fighter to test it against the likes of Shredz and 1st Phorm . So . Does It Works Work ? How do I compare Shredz versus It Works ? - <h> It Works Fat Figher Performance Grade : 8.0 <p> I have to give It Works an even 8.0 on the performance side of things . When I think back to how I looked two weeks ago before I started It Works , to now , there are a few changes that I 'm pretty sure can be tied back to It Works Advanced Formula Fat Fighter . The most noticeable change in my body have been , well , ok not that noticeable . But I think that It Works has actually worked . A little bit . This is what I 've noticed since I finished my trial run : - <p> The most noticeable effect of It Works is that my overall appetite has seemed to diminish slightly . It 's strange because they actually tell you to take Fat Fighter AFTER you eat . This is different than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've tried that advise that you take the pills before you eat . I think the dosage timing is a key difference for It Works vs . Shredz and it impacts how the product performs . But getting back to the effect I 'm discussing- I do n't really know how the product has made my appetite lessen because it seems like taking it after should n't have any impact . But it does . And even in the morning when I like to have quite a hearty breakfast I have n't had the same appetite . It 's like Fat Fighter is working around the clock instead of just right when you take it . Like 1st Phorm Bliss for me seemed to only work for like a few hours where you could feel it doing stuff . But Fat Fighter has effects 24/7 . <p> The other thing that changed from day 1 to day 14 for me was my skin thickness . I mean this in the visual way , where you can just see more definition . I literally do n't think my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking this is some kind of crazy It Works side effect . In fact I did n't notice any It Works side effects for the entire duration that I took the product . But what I mean by skin thickness was that I had more complete abs . Whereas usually I just have my weird oblique definition you could actually see some cuts in the middle where normal people have abs . I usually only see these in cases of extreme dehydration ( like when I 'm hungover AF ) . But strangely enough I think Fat Fighter and it 's carbohydrate blocking was actually helping . This reminded me of one of the effects I saw with another carb blocking fat burner- VULCAN , although the effects were not QUITE as strong as with that one . <p> A few notes before we move into the formula grade are that you probably wo n't get the same results with Fat Fighter as you will with some of the other caffeinated weight loss products . So that 's another of the key differences between Shredz and Protein World and It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.0 <p> I 'm actually going to give this stimulant free fat burner an A on the formula grade because I found that this fat burner performed really quite nicely for me . It did seem to improve my definition without compromising musculature , which some of these products can do if you are n't careful. - <p> The key purpose of of It Works Fat Fighter is to keep your body from storing your food as fat . There are a few ingredients in here that are going to assist in mobilizing and burning the lipids , but really the focus of this formula is on blood sugar regulation and carbohydrate partitioning ' as they often refer to it. - <p> Here are all of the ingredients in It Works Fat Fighter : - <p> Chromium Dinicotinate Glycinate <p> Cactus Leaf <p> Garcinia Cambogia <p> Hydroxycitric Acid <p> Green Tea Leaf Extract <p> Phaseolamin <p> Bitter Melon Fruit Extract <p> Banaba Leaf Extract <p> Gymnema Sylvestre Leaf Extract <p> Vanadium <p> So after rattling off this list of ingredients- a few things jump out at you . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always found chromium to be an effective sort of ingredient for keeping the fat off in the first place . This mineral is essential to your blood sugar regulation . The other pretty noticeable thing that I 'm seeing here is that there actually IS caffeine in the product , contrary to what I literally just told you about the product being stimulant free . Silly me . How foolish and careless . I apologize . But yeah . There is some caffeine but it 's still not going to knock your socks off like EVL ENGN pre workout or something . Or Mister Hyde . Now that stuff was wild . Speaking of wild , how about this packaging ? LOL . Just kidding this product is really pretty bland . <h> It Works Fat Fighter Packaging Grade : 7.6 <p> It works has tried to go a little bit outside the box with their packaging . The black and green accents actually reminds me quite alot of Shakeology . While Shakeology is much more successful in their execution , It Works is less so . This black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in some ways to me . I think the graphical elements could all be scaled up just a bit to cover more real estate and become more prominent . This Advanced Formula Fat Fighter may very well be a powerful fat loss supplement but honestly when you look at the label you are just sort of deceived into thinking that it is just a jar full of green tea pills or something . I mean . You just do n't get the sense that inside there is a powerful product . I think for as much as I love Slender Blend Capsules , that packaging also suffers just a little bit . Now I 'm not saying it has to be as edgy and extreme looking as Performix SST , but I think there is a ton of middle ground that they could have edged ' into to make the product look more effective . I give It Works Fat Fighter a C plus on this criteria . <h> It Works Fat Fighter Review Summary : - <p> It Works Fat Fighter Performance Grade : 8.0 <p> It Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighter Packaging Grade : 7.6 <p> It Works Fat Fighter Value Grade : 9.0 <p> Here are the facts people : Fat Fighter is well formulated , relatively effective , and ridiculously well-priced at just $23.00 . I 'm not saying this is the most powerful fat burner you can buy , but it is certainly a fair value . I mean . Who does n't love a bargin ? * <p> - <h> It Works Fat Fighter Final Review Score : 8.7 <p> Hi , my name is Allie and this blog is my hobby : ) I am passionate about being fit and active , so making a blog about my experience with different products that help me stay healthy made sense to me .

@@90027603 @5527603/ <h> Detox and WeightLoss Tea Reviews ( 6 ) <h> TeaTox Product Review Section <p> I 've finally decided to add Tea Reviews to my blog ! As you know from reading my blog , teas are NOT usually my specialty . I usually dabble more in pre workout , protein , and fat loss supplements in PILL form . But you know what ? All these detox tea ' brands are just becoming TOO big to ignore for any longer ! Clearly these companies are doing something right . With millions of followers on Instagram , several big-time celebrity endorsements , and rapidly-growing product lines- it seems tea is the new big thing in diet and nutrition . As is such , it is with great pleasure that I announce this brand new category to the BPW- the detox tea reviews ! Over the coming weeks you can expect several in-depth reviews right here on the BPW covering Skinny Mint , Skinny Tea , Boo Tea , Fit Tea , Teami , and more . After I 've reviewed enough of these teas , I will post an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Teami blend tea is yet another detox tea program that seems to be all the rage on Instagram . In this review I 'll give you my professional opinion on Teami Blends Tea Skinny tea . I 'll tell you the good parts , the bad parts , and everything in between . This is , hm , I think the fifth Teatox review that I 've done and I must say , well , you 'll see what I think of it in this Teami review . It is made in the U.S.A so I was more excited about this one than some of the others that I 've reviewed . In this Teami Blends Skinny Tea review I 'll do four key things . I 'll tell you if Teami works for weightloss . That will be my primary focus . I 've been taking it for like three weeks now and I 'm in a good position to describe exactly what happens when you use Teami for an extended period of time . Think of me like your own personal guinea pig . Lol . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about the ingredients and if I think it 's a high quality product beneath it all . The last criteria for judgement will be the labeling . Oh , and of course I 'll talk about the taste too . As a matter of fact why do n't we start with the Teami Blends taste <p> Welcome to my fifth detox tea review ! This will be a Flat Tummy Tea Review . And it will be epic . I will compare it to the handful of other detox ' teas that I 've reviewed , and give you my personal opinion on which teatox ' is right for you . So . I 'm going to try and keep this review as basic as possible . I 'll first tell you if Flat Tummy Tea works . That is- did it give me a flat tummy ? Did it reduce the bloat ? Did it make me feel less ' like I am five months pregnant ? ( That 's the feeling that they are comparing to the bloated , fat feeling . Do n't worry I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs , which is part of the two week pack for $32 . I wanted the FULL Flat Tummy effect . And in this Flat Tummy Tea Review I 'll tell you if it worked . I know . How can you tell if you are cleansed or not ? Well , that 's a great question . I 've tried to touch on the cleanse ' side of things in some of my other Teatox reviews , and I 'll try to do the same in this review . I 'm just going to tell you how I 've FELT- physically , emotionally , etc. , for the two weeks that I was on the Flat Tummy Teatox . I 'm going to spend the majority of the review talking about results , but after that , I 'm also going to talk about ingredients , and also packaging . If that sounds good to you , let 's get this Flat Tummy Tea Review started ! <p> Sigh . I suppose there is just no more procrastinating this BaeTea 14 Day Teatox Review that can be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet . All the furthest corners of my favorite blogs . And it 's time to finally focus in and let you know how BaeTea works . If Baetea Works . Does BaeTea work ? However you want to frame- we 're going to cover it in this review . I structure these Teatox reviews similar to the way I structure my pre workout reviews except the performance ' does n't really apply to a workout , but rather to whether or not the product helped burn through some extra fat . It 's tricky to measure the results of some of these detox tea ' products , but , hey . Someone 's got to do it ! So I 'll go ahead and give this one my best shot . After we talk about **25;0;TOOLONG , we 're going to talk about the ingredients . As you know from my other Teatox Reviews , I 'm still kind of learning the ropes ' about the various types of tea , but I 'm slowly getting to a point where I can tell if a tea is premium or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll talk about the taste , and then finally about the packaging . If that all sounds like a good time to you , let 's jump right into this BaeTea Review ! <p> I 've been taking Fit Tea 's 28 Day Tea Detox for about a week now and I just wanted to set aside some time for a quick FitTea 28 Day Tea Detox Review . I will most likely keep taking this product for a little while longer , but also maybe not . I 'll spend a good chunk of this review talking about some of the pros and cons of taking the 28 Day Detox and will try and provide you with at least a basic understanding of the benefits and side effects . As with my other Tea / Teatox reviews , I 'm going to grade this product across four of the different main aspects that you can possibly grade a tea . And that is the flavor , the formulation , and then even the packaging . A good piece of the review is going to be devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And even how does it compare to some of the others that I 've tried , such as SkinnyMint . Lol . I know . Performance ' sounds like an odd word choice to use in conjunction with a tea product . It 's as if I 'm describing a singer or a dancer or an athlete or something . But anyways . Let 's get this FitTea Review started . <p> My Skinnymint Teatox Review is going to be epic and might just be the highlight of your day today . Hi everyone and Merry Christmas week to all of you . My name is Allie and if you are unfamiliar with my reviews , I am the world 's most fun supplement reviewer . I usually review pre workout , fat loss , and protein supplements , but today I 'm embarking on my second teatox review . My first one was a bit of a departure from the norm , but I 've had several fans complimenting my Matefit review . Now that I 've tried Skinnymint , I 'm really excited to compare and contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a better experience . In this Skinnymint review , I 'll tell you what sort of effects and benefits ( if any ) I noticed . I 'll also talk about all the ingredients in Skinnymint , and what my thoughts are around the formulation . Finally , I 'll do a packaging review , and combine ALL elements of the review into one comprehensive Skinnymint review summary . So if you 're here looking for a totally sarcastic , witty , but informative and helpful look at Skinnymint , you 've found the right review . Let 's get started . <p> MateFit Reviews are pretty easy to find on the Matefit website . But in this day and age , it 's kind of hard for me to trust what the companies put for reviews on their OWN website . So I of course decided to take it on myself to buy some of this stuff and post my own complete review . In this Matefit review , I will grade the product across three different criteria . Er . Four . Sorry . Bear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my detox tea reviews . So the first category will of course be the taste . We 'll talk about the flavors , aromas , and more . You know I am a very poetic person , So I 'm hoping you will enjoy each flavor-journey ' that I bring you on . My mission is to give you the sense that you are right there next to me , sharing my MateFit tea . Kind of a weird visual there . Lol . After we talk about the taste we will get a little technical and discuss the ingredients and types of tea used . In this part of the review the goal is to simply go over the different types of tea in the product so that you know what to expect in terms of results . Speaking of results , that is what we 'll talk about next in the Matefit Review . Does Matefit ACTUALLY WORK ? That 's what we 'll focus much of the review on . I 'll conclude with a packaging and branding grade , before ending the review by assigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my first ever Matefit Tea Review ! 
@@90027606 @5527606/ <h> Nugo Nutrition Strong Bars Review - Lots to Love <h> Nugo Nutrition Stronger Bars <p> I came across Nugo on Twitter . I was discussing my last protein bar that I reviewed - the Larabar - when my twitter friend @nikesoverheels reccommended the Nugo bars . She reccommend them after I had mentioned that the mighty Quest bar was my favorite . @nikesoverheels then brought the Nugo bars , and brought up that Quest bars are pretty expensive . More on that later- but the awesome thing was that Nugo was listening closely enough to take note of our Twitter conversation , and send me a few samples of their Nugo Stronger bars to try ! I appreciate a brand that takes action and really interacts with people on social media , so I knew I had to give them a review . So let 's get into it ! <p> Flavor : 8.7 <p> I 'm going to go into all the delicious details of all three flavors- but i want to open my flavor review with an overall statement of flavor-success . Nu go put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative flavors without sacrificing the integrity and ' natural ' composition of their product is a real challenge- but I think Nugo pulled it off with all three flavors that I tried. - <h> Cookies ' n Cream : 9.3 <p> This was my favorite of the three flavors . It had that nice creamy layer on the top like you get on the Nature valley ' yogurt ' edition bars ( but with like half the sugar of those ) , plus it had really nice chunks of chocolate to give you the balance between creaminess and chocolatey . The million dollar question is - which is better ? This , or Quest bar cookies n cream ? For me personally , it 's a toss-up . The Quest has more creamy , while the Nugo has more chocolatey . In my opinion neither of them really tastes like an Oreo cookie , but that was n't the expectation . I love Nugo 's Cookies ' N Cream flavor and would highly reccommend it. - <h> Carmel Pretzel : 9.1 <p> Carmel Pretzel was a flavor that really took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very optimistic heading into this sampling , because I 've never been too crazy about using pretzel as a mixin . However , Nugo put together a winner with their carmel pretzel flavor . The meat of the bar itself had a really smooth and non-overpowering carmel flavor , while the pretzel chunks on the top layer added a nice contrasting texture and saltiness to offset the sweet of the carmel . I truly enjoyed this flavor and may have to order myself a box. - <h> Peanut Cluster : 8.8 <p> The ' bronze ' medalist of the lot was the peanut cluster . By no means did I dislike the peanut cluster flavored bars , but they just were not my favorite of the lot . If I had one reccommendation to Nugo- it would be to evolove the the peanut cluster flavor into a chocolate peanut butter . Every protein bar in the world offers a choco-PB flavor , but there 's good reason for it- EVERYONE loves that classic choco+PB ! And by everyone I mean especially me , so please Nugo Nutrition , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you : ) - <h> Nutrition Profile : 10 <p> By far the best part of the Nugo Stronger bar has to be the macronutrient profile . As someone who keeps track of her macros and tries to hit very specific goals with them , this was my favorite part of the bars . I must say that these bars are not for everyone . If you are someone who is trying to lose weight rapidly- these bars are almost certainly not for you . And even if you are a casual fitness enthusiast- these STILL might not be for you . Here 's why . These bars contain 300 calories . That 's essentially a meal in a bar . So you want to either A. use it as such , or B. Be someone who follows either a VERY high-intensity workout program OR works out very frequently ( which is me : ) ) . On top of that- I am in a muscle/weight-gain cycle , so these bars help me get just above my caloric expenditure . <p> In addition to be one of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these also come with a decent amount of carbohydrate- weighing in at 37 grams . Of those 37 grams- 12 are from sugar . This is not horrible , considering that many protein bars can include around 20 grams . I do n't really have a problem with the sugar , especiaily considering the alternatives . I mean- at the end of the day the thing has to taste good , and that means it needs some sweetness . So either you put some real sugar in it ( which Nugo did via agave syrup ) , or , you fill it with acesulfame-K and sucrolose , or you fill it with 25 grams of sugar alcohol . I 'm not crazy about EITHER of those alternatives : ace-K and sucralose are the most artificial creation of all-time , while sugar alcohol makes me feel sick in higher quantities ( like they are in some Quest bars ) . - <p> The final touch-point on the nutrition profile is the protein . The amount is 27 grams , which is a solid amount . It 's pretty in-line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the protein level is also higher is a good sign . As for the protein sources- I have mixed opinions . It looks like the protein is derived from a few different sources . The first on the list is whey- which i love . This fast digesting protein makes it a great fit for people who lift and do resistance training . The second source is rice protein- which I 'm not as fond of since it has a less desirious composition of the essential amino acids in comparison to a meat or diary based protein . At this point I would be nit-picking . Plus , the whey is listed first anyways , so it ( should ) be dosed in a higher amount than the rice. - <h> Packaging : 9.0 <p> A final point of scoring has to be on the packaging . If you 've read my reviews before , you know I appreciate a great package . I have to give Nugo an A minus for their packaging . It is really pretty good . I appreciate that they have unique color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have a real product image on the label , as oppose to some phony stock graphics of the flavors that are supposed to be in the product . I also think the designer did a nice job with the font selection . The word ' STRONGER ' really invokes a strong emotion , and is a great fit for the product. - <h> Overall Score : 9.2 <p> In summary , I have nothing but good things to say about Nugo stronger . I will say they are slightly more expensive than others , but you have to keep in mind that they did not cut any corners on this product- it really is of high quality . AND , as you can see from reading the nutrition facts on these- it 's a LOT of bar for the buck . If you want a great tasting bar with solid macros- here 's all the information on where to buy them . Or , Check out Nugo 's site for more information : they make a wide range of bars for different fitness and health goals. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to sample their great products- thanks NUGO - you have made a believer out of me : ) - <p> Hi , my name is Allie and this blog is my hobby : ) I am passionate about being fit and active , so making a blog about my experience with different products that help me stay healthy made sense to me .

@@90027614 @5527614/ <h> Detox and WeightLoss Tea Reviews ( 6 ) <h> TeaTox Product Review Section <p> I 've finally decided to add Tea Reviews to my blog ! As you know from reading my blog , teas are NOT usually my specialty . I usually dabble more in pre workout , protein , and fat loss supplements in PILL form . But you know what ? All these detox tea ' brands are just becoming TOO big to ignore for any longer ! Clearly these companies are doing something right . With millions of followers on Instagram , several big-time celebrity endorsements , and rapidly-growing product lines- it seems tea is the new big thing in diet and nutrition . As is such , it is with great pleasure that I announce this brand new category to the BPW- the detox tea reviews ! Over the coming weeks you can expect several in-depth reviews right here on the BPW covering Skinny Mint , Skinny Tea , Boo Tea , Fit Tea , Teami , and more . After I 've reviewed enough of these teas , I will post an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Teami blend tea is yet another detox tea program that seems to be all the rage on Instagram . In this review I 'll give you my professional opinion on Teami Blends Tea Skinny tea . I 'll tell you the good parts , the bad parts , and everything in between . This is , hm , I think the fifth Teatox review that I 've done and I must say , well , you 'll see what I think of it in this Teami review . It is made in the U.S.A so I was more excited about this one than some of the others that I 've reviewed . In this Teami Blends Skinny Tea review I 'll do four key things . I 'll tell you if Teami works for weightloss . That will be my primary focus . I 've been taking it for like three weeks now and I 'm in a good position to describe exactly what happens when you use Teami for an extended period of time . Think of me like your own personal guinea pig . Lol . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about the ingredients and if I think it 's a high quality product beneath it all . The last criteria for judgement will be the labeling . Oh , and of course I 'll talk about the taste too . As a matter of fact why do n't we start with the Teami Blends taste <p> Welcome to my fifth detox tea review ! This will be a Flat Tummy Tea Review . And it will be epic . I will compare it to the handful of other detox ' teas that I 've reviewed , and give you my personal opinion on which teatox ' is right for you . So . I 'm going to try and keep this review as basic as possible . I 'll first tell you if Flat Tummy Tea works . That is- did it give me a flat tummy ? Did it reduce the bloat ? Did it make me feel less ' like I am five months pregnant ? ( That 's the feeling that they are comparing to the bloated , fat feeling . Do n't worry I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs , which is part of the two week pack for $32 . I wanted the FULL Flat Tummy effect . And in this Flat Tummy Tea Review I 'll tell you if it worked . I know . How can you tell if you are cleansed or not ? Well , that 's a great question . I 've tried to touch on the cleanse ' side of things in some of my other Teatox reviews , and I 'll try to do the same in this review . I 'm just going to tell you how I 've FELT- physically , emotionally , etc. , for the two weeks that I was on the Flat Tummy Teatox . I 'm going to spend the majority of the review talking about results , but after that , I 'm also going to talk about ingredients , and also packaging . If that sounds good to you , let 's get this Flat Tummy Tea Review started ! <p> Sigh . I suppose there is just no more procrastinating this BaeTea 14 Day Teatox Review that can be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet . All the furthest corners of my favorite blogs . And it 's time to finally focus in and let you know how BaeTea works . If Baetea Works . Does BaeTea work ? However you want to frame- we 're going to cover it in this review . I structure these Teatox reviews similar to the way I structure my pre workout reviews except the performance ' does n't really apply to a workout , but rather to whether or not the product helped burn through some extra fat . It 's tricky to measure the results of some of these detox tea ' products , but , hey . Someone 's got to do it ! So I 'll go ahead and give this one my best shot . After we talk about **25;27;TOOLONG , we 're going to talk about the ingredients . As you know from my other Teatox Reviews , I 'm still kind of learning the ropes ' about the various types of tea , but I 'm slowly getting to a point where I can tell if a tea is premium or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll talk about the taste , and then finally about the packaging . If that all sounds like a good time to you , let 's jump right into this BaeTea Review ! <p> I 've been taking Fit Tea 's 28 Day Tea Detox for about a week now and I just wanted to set aside some time for a quick FitTea 28 Day Tea Detox Review . I will most likely keep taking this product for a little while longer , but also maybe not . I 'll spend a good chunk of this review talking about some of the pros and cons of taking the 28 Day Detox and will try and provide you with at least a basic understanding of the benefits and side effects . As with my other Tea / Teatox reviews , I 'm going to grade this product across four of the different main aspects that you can possibly grade a tea . And that is the flavor , the formulation , and then even the packaging . A good piece of the review is going to be devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And even how does it compare to some of the others that I 've tried , such as SkinnyMint . Lol . I know . Performance ' sounds like an odd word choice to use in conjunction with a tea product . It 's as if I 'm describing a singer or a dancer or an athlete or something . But anyways . Let 's get this FitTea Review started . <p> My Skinnymint Teatox Review is going to be epic and might just be the highlight of your day today . Hi everyone and Merry Christmas week to all of you . My name is Allie and if you are unfamiliar with my reviews , I am the world 's most fun supplement reviewer . I usually review pre workout , fat loss , and protein supplements , but today I 'm embarking on my second teatox review . My first one was a bit of a departure from the norm , but I 've had several fans complimenting my Matefit review . Now that I 've tried Skinnymint , I 'm really excited to compare and contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a better experience . In this Skinnymint review , I 'll tell you what sort of effects and benefits ( if any ) I noticed . I 'll also talk about all the ingredients in Skinnymint , and what my thoughts are around the formulation . Finally , I 'll do a packaging review , and combine ALL elements of the review into one comprehensive Skinnymint review summary . So if you 're here looking for a totally sarcastic , witty , but informative and helpful look at Skinnymint , you 've found the right review . Let 's get started . <p> MateFit Reviews are pretty easy to find on the Matefit website . But in this day and age , it 's kind of hard for me to trust what the companies put for reviews on their OWN website . So I of course decided to take it on myself to buy some of this stuff and post my own complete review . In this Matefit review , I will grade the product across three different criteria . Er . Four . Sorry . Bear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my detox tea reviews . So the first category will of course be the taste . We 'll talk about the flavors , aromas , and more . You know I am a very poetic person , So I 'm hoping you will enjoy each flavor-journey ' that I bring you on . My mission is to give you the sense that you are right there next to me , sharing my MateFit tea . Kind of a weird visual there . Lol . After we talk about the taste we will get a little technical and discuss the ingredients and types of tea used . In this part of the review the goal is to simply go over the different types of tea in the product so that you know what to expect in terms of results . Speaking of results , that is what we 'll talk about next in the Matefit Review . Does Matefit ACTUALLY WORK ? That 's what we 'll focus much of the review on . I 'll conclude with a packaging and branding grade , before ending the review by assigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my first ever Matefit Tea Review !

It 's been a great deal of time since my last review so hopefully today 's Gamma Labs 24k Gold Pre Workout will give you guys all the satisfaction you 've been yearning for since my absence recently . So vain . So vain . Lol . But no really I 'm glad to be back and this week I 'll try and get back on my regular cadence of posting daily pre workout reviews for you guys . Today 's review is pretty awesome and is all about the Gamma Labs gold pre workout . And yes , this pre workout is said to have ACTUAL gold in it . Which is pretty crazy . I 'm not sure if gold is edible or not . But I guess unless we think Gamma Labs is trying to kill us , we are being told that gold is actually edible . Who knew ! Not I. In this review I 'll tell you if the golden pre workout is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy , the formulation quality , and of course the packaging in my first pre workout review in quite some time . So sit back , relax , and watch me put my Midas touch on this Gamma Labs 24k pre workout review . <p> The 24k Strength Formula from Gamma Labs is everything you 've ever wanted if you are like me . What do I mean by that ? I mean that I love anything shiny , expensive , and golden . So obviously I was thrilled when I saw the announcement on Gamma Labs Facebook that they were releasing this 24k Gold pre workout . What a beautiful jar this is . But how does the powder inside taste ? Let 's start with the Gamma Labs 24k Gold Pre Workout flavor review. - <h> Does Gamma Labs 24k Gold Pre Workout Taste Good ? - <p> I bought the one Mixed Berry flavor of 24K and thought it was just alright . I think I 've definitely been spoiled by my years of drinking Cellucor C4 , which is , in my opinion one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The 24K pre workout tastes just okay in my opinion . The flavors are not quite as good as you would expect from a company with the resources and history like Gamma Labs . And you know from my Gamma Labs G-Fuel reviews that I was n't blown away really by any of the four flavors that I tried . Eh . The lemon ice was alright . But . Nothing blew me out of the water . <p> The mixed berry needs more sweet , and actually much more of a berry flavoring agent in my opinion . It just came in very flat to me . So . I think I 'll give Gamma Labs a sort of ho-hum ' rating of just 8.5 on the flavor . Let 's move into performance for the 24k pre workout. - <h> Does the 24k Gold Pre Workout Perform like Gold ? - <p> The short answer is sort of ' , and the long answer is that the Gamma Labs 24k Pre Workout just does not perform as flawlessly as it 's golden sheen might have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good punch of energy up front , but really lack some of the back-end efficacy that I have come to expect of pre workouts after reviewing hundreds of them. - <p> I tried 24K for my hungover ' special workout consisting of ten sets of squat to press . I always do this workout on the Monday following a drinking day , and it almost always pays off for me . Meaning even though I almost have a heart failure during it , I always leave the gym feeling back to normal . This 24k pre workout got me into the gym okay , but once I was there , I felt like I was really sort of lacking the sort of DEEP energy that some other pre workouts have given me . By the fourth set of my squat to press , I could feel 24k sort of wearing off , leaving me with a partial tank of energy and just not very much left to power through . I dug deep and finished the workout , but I really would have liked if Gamma Labs pre workout had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Let me discuss some of the ingredients in Gamma Labs 24k Pre Workout now . I 'll give it a B minus on performance. - <h> Gamma Labs Pre Workout Formulation is so Average <p> The days of the proprietary blend are more or less over , and that means that we 're given full insight into dosages of each pre workout in the modern day . I have found that while some pre workouts deliver with full , effective dosages , some others , and Gamma Labs is included in this , have seemed to fall short on their dosages . Let me give you some examples within this product : - <p> Creatine Magna Power : Underdosed- <p> Acetyl-L-Tyrosine : Underdoesed- <p> Glycerol Monostearate : Way underdosed- <p> ATP : Underdosed- <p> Those are four expensive ingredients that you really would like to see dosed higher . I 've been seeing tyrosine used more and more in pre workouts , most notably in C4 , and others . I know that the 10mg in Gamma Labs 24k Gold Pre Workout is completely not effective . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gold too . I mean . 5 hundredths of a gram of gold ? I get that the gold part is totally for show and a bit of a Gamma Labs gimmick , but I guess my opinion is just why include it at all ? Like . Why not just use that money to put some more creatine magnapower in there or something . Yeah . I just do n't love the formula . Caffeine is dosed well at 300mg , and I do appreciate the pump ingredients they 've included . I always get a good pump from Arginine , even if it has been pretty much proven as useless for performance . The performance of a pump is just that it looks good . Lol . But . This formula is good but not great . A little more real performance and a little bit less flash on the part of Gamma Labs and they 'd be in a good place . Let 's move on to packaging now though. - <h> 24 Gold Pre Workout Looks Fantastic . <p> There 's no debating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean . Have you checked out my top pre workouts in a while ? Very rarely do I take a supplement that does n't look absolutely fantastic on the outside . I very much enjoy gold . This much you know . And probably - you do too . So let 's face it humankind loves gold . Which is why I have to tip my hat to Gamma Labs on their decision to create a golden pre workout . It 's just awesome visually. - <p> The golden tub. - <p> The golden Lid. - <p> The golden name and graphics. - <p> Why not just make a gold pre workout with real gold in it ? I mean . What a brilliant idea by the folks at Gamma Labs . I LOVE love LOVE the font used on the label 24k ' . It 's just pure brilliance . It matches the product them so well . The black backdrop that frames the gold grahics is angular , geometric , asymmetrical , and absolutely tasteful . They provide the PERFECT backdrop to the information presented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key benefits of Gamma Labs 24k Strength Formula in the most beautiful manner . They have absolutely hit it out of the park from a packaging standpoint with this one . I appreciate it . I really do . Let 's move on now though . A 24 out of 10 on packaging. - <h> Gamma Labs 24k Gold Pre Workout Review Summary <p> Flavor : 8.5 <p> Performance : 8.4 <p> Formula : 8.0 <p> Packaging : 8.4 <p> Value : 7.8 <p> The pricetag of the golden pre workout throws you for a bit of a loop here . I mean . $70 is just a lot of money for a pre workout . It really is . And some folks are going to pay it , heck , I did , but as I 'm sure the Gamma Labs team is going to find out , the pre workout crowd is n't always the most sophisticated crowd . Not always the most savvy crowd . And You know what ? They might not be willing to pay $70 for the special gold-infused 24k pre workout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is well-made , I just am not sure if it 's going to be a winner in the long term , as I think it 's price is just too rich for the masses . A cool concept , with adequate execution , regardless. *- <p> Hi , my name is Allie and this blog is my hobby : ) I am passionate about being fit and active , so making a blog about my experience with different products that help me stay healthy made sense to me .

@@90027740 @5527740/ <h> Women 's Protein Powder Reviews ( 105 ) <p> The protein supplement category has been growing steadily for the better part of the last decade . With so many options out there- it can be challenging to decide which type of protein supplement is best for you . Further complicating things is the emergence of several vegan protein options which can cater to those on specific diets . I personally try to eat Vegan and ( mostly ) gluten-free , which is why I prefer a blended protein of brown rice and yellow pea . But , that 's not to say that I do n't enjoy some of the more traditional - proteins- sometimes the best option is whey or casein . In this section I 'll try and help identify the best protein for women by reviewing several of the top offerings on the market .

@@90027755 @5527755/ <h> NLA For Her Lean Protein Bars , Better Than You Expect .. <p> It 's been a little while since my last protein bar review , and also a little while since my last NLA for Her review so of course I had to knock two birds out with one stone and cook up an NLA Her Whey Lean Protein Bar review . In this review I 'll tell you what I like about these protein bars , what I do NOT like about these bars , and finally , if you should pony up and buy yourself a box of NLA Her Whey Lean Protein Bars . Sound good ? Of course it does . Let 's get the review started . <p> I 'm actually going to make this review a little more concise and succinct than my usual reviews . I 'm going to tell you about the flavors , the textures , the packaging , and of course how my love life is going right now . Wait . What ? What does that have to do with NLA for her bars ? NOTHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do what I want , LOl . Oh dear . I 've gone and lost my mind have n't I. Sigh . Well . Let 's see what happens here. - <p> NLA For Her is one of the more common brands in the sports nutrition for women space . You know I 've reviewed almost all of their products in the last several years , and I 've had mixed opinions on their output . The products are not always the best-tasting- as you know from my NLA Uplift review . These are products that have worked OK for me , but not always had the best experiencing going down the old chute . So this being an edible product where taste is very prominent , I was just a little bit nervous that the NLA For Her Lean Protein bar would n't be as good tasting as some of the other protein bars I reviewed . So . Were my fears confirmed ? Or denied ? Let me tell you. - <h> What is the Best Flavor of NLA Bar ? And Does it TASTE Good ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLA Lean Protein bar was that the cookie dough flavor , which is the only flavor , actually tastes nothing like cookie dough . Sigh . I know . How . How is it possible that you make a COOKIE DOUGH flavored bar that does n't taste like that flavor at all ? I do n't know , but we should ask NLA For Her . One other thing that you have to be aware of is that as of the writing of this article , there is just ONE flavor of NLA Her Whey Lean Protein bar . That 's right . Just one . So I suppose the cookie dough IS the best flavor of NLA Her Whey Lean Protein Bar . But it 's the only one . Hm. - <p> But yeah overall these bars probably do n't crack my top ten for best-tasting protein bars on the market . The texture is fine .. they are soft and chewy almost like a combat crunch barbut at the end of the day , there is n't a whole lot of actual flavor in them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeteners , but that is constant no matter what bar you get pretty much . The other thing that I do n't love about these protein bars is that they do tend to melt at a pretty modest temperature . I had one in my car for likenot that long and the thing was just a puddle after a fifteen minute stop into the drug store . So keep that in mind as another downside of NLA Her Whey Protein bars . But . Let 's try not to be TOO negative here . There are some positives about these protein bars . Mostly the thing that I like most is that the nutrition facts and overall health profile of NLA Her Whey Bars are actually really good. - <h> NLA Her Whey Bars are Actually Quite Healthy <p> I know . Actually ? Are n't ALL of these bars healthy ? Well . Yes and no . While most of them ARE healthy , you actually have several of them that end up packing more fat and more calories than a candy bar . I think the NLA Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients then 75-80% of all protein bars . Here is the full list of ingredients in NLA Her Lean Protein Bars : - <p> And then here are a few musings of my own about the list . First , I like that the bars do n't use soy , or any low quality protein sources to dilute the amount of protein that they have in here . I love the fact that they have natural flavors as well . That could be their cursing AND blessing since they do n't really taste like cookie dough but at least you get to avoid the artificial flavors . There is sucralose used in here , but I 'm guessing it 's a very small amount . Overall not such a bad ingredient list . Like I said , some bars have easily three or four times more ingredients than the NLA bars . Let 's look at the macros here : - <p> 190 calories <p> Total Fat 5g <p> Sat Fat 3g <p> Cholesterol 50mg <p> Sugar 6g <p> Sugar Alcohol 5g <p> Fiber 6g <p> Protein 20g <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's not a deal breaker . The sugar alcohol and sugars add up to 11 grams which is also a little high but I suppose the NLA for Her Lean Protein bars would taste like garbage without them . And . Really that 's most of what I wanted to cover as far as nutrition . They are n't perfect but they are awfully close . Let 's move on to the packaging now. - <h> NLA for Her Bars Look Okay. - <p> The NLA products have improved their appearance over the years . From a truly awful white jar and white lid to a sleeker black jar with custom pink lid , I think they have made strides .

In this super thorough review , I 'll go into excruciating detail on one of the year 's best fat burners that I 've tried thus far . I 'm going to talk first about , well , myself and what I 've been up to .

I have conducted nearly a hundred individual pre workout reviews so you can bet that I know what I am talking about . In this Kaged Muscle Pre Kaged review what I 'm going to do first is tell you about the flavor . Does it taste good ? Does it taste bad ? What can you compare it to ? After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all- does Pre Kaged work ? And how does it compare to Pre Jym ? I instantly thought of Pre Jym because these two products are named the same way and are big , non-proprietary blend pre workouts . I 'll recount my workout experience with Pre Kaged for you and give you a sense of what it feels like to take the product . Following the performance side of things we 'll open up the hood and see what ingredients go into this product . I 'll close things out with an overview of the black and green Pre Kaged packaging , and then wrap things up at the end in a final review summary . How does that sound ? Pretty good , right ? I thought so . Let 's un-kage this review and get started .

So turn the girls to mute , put your reading cap on , and get ready for yet another fun Optimum Nutrition Review . <p> I do n't have much caffeine in me . But I do have a fire in the fireplace , a great song in my headphones , and my dog Serabe curled up at my feet . I guess you could say life is pretty good . You know what else is pretty good ? Optimum Nutrition . Yes . The whole company . They 're pretty good . They never put out something that I love , and they certainly never put out something that I hate . They just make good , safe , high-performance supplements . They 're always priced a tiny bit higher than you want to pay , but often times it is worth it . I got my man a jar of Gold Standard Pre Workout for Christmas and he was only about halfway through it before he switched to Adonis pre workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was fine with me because I could try some of the ON pre workout . I took it for the first time today , and am here to tell you ALL about it . Let 's start from the beginning . <h> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Flavor Grade : 8.9 <p> Some of the Gold Standard reviews online are less than flattering when they talk about the Gold Standard Pre Workout taste . They say that it 's not sweet enough , and also leaves a funky aftertaste in some flavors . I 'm not going to write home about how good this pre workout tastes , but I 'm here to say that it does n't taste so bad at all . I actually really enjoyed my pineapple flavor . I would n't have picked pineapple for myself , but my bf literally LOVES pineapple so I did the good girlfriend thing and got him the one that HE wanted . Not the one I wanted . That 's not how it goes usually . But it was Christmastime . Point being that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted . But to my delight , it was drinkable , if not enjoyable . The pineapple flavors were far from being authentic or true to an actual pineapple , but I really did enjoy it never-the-less , because the sweetness was literally perfectly matched with the bitter/sour elements . It was really nicely balanced . The texture and mixability were also completely on point , which is why I 'm giving Gold Standard a high B ' plus on the flavor. - <h> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Formula Grade : 8.9 <p> As I swished down my pre workout , I had a nice long , hard look at the supplement facts panel . There are 30 servings per container , and each container has 30 servings . The scoop size is n't tiny like some , and at the same time it 's not monstrous like some others ( cough Pre Kaged cough ) . - <p> The ingredients start with a big old dosage of vitamin D. I love this play . Most people do n't know , but vitamin D is probably the MOST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your frame- which I am absolutely trying to do following a diet in which I , er , sort of overdid ' it , as I tend to do on occasion . Sure I lost some fat . But I also lost way too much muscle mass . I need to get some back . Gold Standard will actually help me do that because in addition to Vitamin D , it also has these strength-boosting ingredients : - <p> Creatine Monohydrate <p> N-Acetyl L-Carnitine Hcl <p> L-Citrulline Malate <p> Caffeine <p> Not the most comprehensive formula I 've ever seen , but it has just enough punch to get you through a really difficult workout . I would like to see them add some additional caffeine to the Gold Standard pre workout powder , but you can also double up on the servings to get to 350 mg- which is a sweet spot for me. - <p> The strongest elements of this formula are the big dose of creatine ( will add some bloat , just so you know ) , and then the N-Acetyl L-Carnitine . I literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . Oh wait . I do . So yeah . Good formula . Nothing crazy . But really solid. - <h> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Performance Grade : 8.9 <p> After I polished off my last sip of Gold Standard pre workout , it was off to the gym . Like I said , I 've really been trying to get my strength back . So that meant it was back to the weights . No more cardio until I 'm back at a healthy weight . ( Can you tell my boyfriend had a very frank heart-to-heart with me about my dieting habits ? ) . ( And by dieting habits I mean eating disorder ? ) . Lol . Helpless emoji . But yeah . Weights ! - <p> I got right into some rear delt raises to activate my upper body muscles . I 've really been trying to balance out my upper body and get my posterior on point . It 'll help my slouchy , horrible posture too . I was able to crank out sets of 18 , for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps , and delts . I started to feel my elbow pain start to nag , so I did have to stop there , but , I felt really , really good until then . 3 grams of creatine will do that for you every time . I felt strong and dominant . The focus was also pretty good . There 's not a whole lot of pump ' like you get with something like White Rapids ( our silver medalist in the BPW Top Ten Pre 's this year ) , but Gold Standard is not about the pump . It 's all about the strength , and the performance . <p> As I moved into some dumbbell lunges , I could continue to feel that effect prove out . The endurance of this product is average , and could be improved . But that 's why you 're supposed to buy Optimum 's BCAA 's to go along with it . Right ? Of course ( My Amino Energy Review Here ) . I finished the workout sweating like a hog , and feeling very fulfilled and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my body to the point where I look almost like a whole different person after a strength workout . Bloat city . Such a good look . Lol . Definitely something to consider if your wondering can girls take Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard pre workout . I do really like this pre workout for adding strength and mass . Less so for cutting down , or for weight loss purposes. - <h> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Packaging Grade : 9.7 <p> This is one of the best-looking pre workouts on the market today in my opinion . There 's a sort of continuity to the product that I enjoy tremendously . From the lid , to the jar , to the color palette , to the Banned Substance Free ' emblem " this product is absolutely gorgeous . It all starts with using real golden finish as the primary color . When the name is Gold Standard Pre-Workout ' , and then you use gold as the main color , it 's like everything is aligned so magnificently . You ca n't help but fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick of color nestled into the right-side of the design , which reinforces the flavor of the pre workout. - <p> The sickest part of this design is probably the gold lid , but in addition to that , the entire design language is very futuristic without being over-the-top . It 's geometrically sound . It 's refined but distinctive . I feel like I 'm voicing over a car commercial . Hey . That 's not a bad comparison now that I think of it . This pre workout belongs in that Matthew McConaughey commercial with the nice house and the nice Cadillac . It 's that same sort of luxe metropolitan ' vibe . If that makes no sense at all , call me on it please . Lol . But that 's about the best way I can describe it. - <p> If there 's one knock on this product , visually speaking , it 's that it 's not terribly feminine . I assure you , woman can take Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout , but I do n't think tons of chicks are walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the one for me ' . But I think that 's fine by ON . They know their customers are informed enough to grab some Gold Standard Pre Workout by looking at the Supplement Facts . So . Yeah . I really do n't have to say much more about the looks of this pre workout . It 's incredibly attractive. - <h> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Review Summary <p> - <p> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Flavor Grade : 8.9 <p> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Formula Grade : 8.9 <p> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Performance Grade : 8.9 <p> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Packaging Grade : 9.7 <p> Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre Workout Value Score : 9.5 <p> - <p> Earlier in the review I said Optimum Nutrition does n't often blow me away .

Are these bars actually healhty ? What 's in them ? You 're going to find out . I 'll conclude with a brief design study on G2G packaging , and then leave you with a final review summary , in which we 'll assign G2G a final review score . Yes I just referred to myself as we ' . Split personality whatup . Ok let 's get started . <p> So one of the ballar things about being a blogger is that , well , every so often a smart company will come along and get some product in your hands knowing that you will probably provide some feedback and marketing for them . So I was pretty stoked when G2G contacted me and I got to try their awesome bars . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy it was , I knew I was , should I say , Good 2 Go ' in terms of protein bar stash for the week . And that 's a pretty darn good feeling . I rushed the box back to my apartment and ripped it open like a kid on Christmas morning . To my delight , I found four boxes of beautiful bars inside . TWO chocolate peanut butter , and then a peanut butter fruit nut and also an almond one . Of course I went STRAIGHT for the peanut butter chocolate chip . Which is surprising considering I almost overdosed on Reese 's PB cups just a last weekend . Yeah . It 's possible . So let me tell you about the taste of G2G bars. - <p> ' Dat Fridge Stock ' Do .. <h> Good 2 Go Bars Flavor Grade : 9.7 <p> Well that 's a pretty dang good start for G2G I think . A plus on flavor . Let 's face it , taste is way more than half the battle with protein bars . In this day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence , I think the folks at G2G have set themselves up nicely by quite frankly NAILING the taste of these protein bars . I 've tried my peanut butter chocolate chip and peanut butter fruit nut bars and want to describe the tastes in some detail for you : - <p> Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip : The first thing that comes to mind immediately on biting down into one of these bars is , F*CKK YES ' . The second is OO THAS SWEET ' . And then the third is WAIT . I KNOW THIS FLAVOR ' . And then you spend a hot second in thought , trying to place where you 've had this sort of bar before . And then it hits you . Perfect Bar . You know . Those ones in the fridge section of Whole Foods . They 're in the pink , or blue wrapper ( Is it sad that I know all this from memory ) . Awesome bars are indeed awesome tasting . They are very peanut butter-y tasting , just like G2G . The difference between G2G and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste in Good 2 Go . And so for me , I 'd actually probably rate G2G bar above Perfect Bar . Perfect bar also does n't have chocolate in it . G2G does . And it 's darn good chocolate , too . It 's real chocolate ( cough , QUEST , cough ) , and is of course the perfect complement to the peanut butter flavors. - <p> Peanut Butter Fruit Nut : This flavor is very similar to the peanut butter chocolate , just without the chocolate . I did n't REALLY pick up a ton of the fruit flavors in this G2G bar , but it was still super tasty none-the-less . The absence of chocolate allows even more of the wholesomeness of the oats to come through , which I found to be really nice . This bar is equally as sweet and PB chocolate , and has the same sort of grainy chewiness that melts away into smooth , velvety , buttery awesomeness once it hits your lips . I am a big fan of this peanut butter anything , so by default the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue. - <p> Almond Butter Chocolate Chip : I have not yet tried this flavor , but I 'm sure it 's the bomb too ! <h> Good 2 Go Bar Ingredients Grade : 9.0 <p> I 'm keeping the ingredients grade in the A range , but we do have a few things to touch on with regard to ingredients and supplement facts . In terms of ingredients themselves- you wo n't find a cleaner ' or more natural recipe . The list goes a little something like this ( for PB Chocolate Chip ) : <p> Peanut Butter <p> Whey Protein Isolate <p> Honey <p> Brown Rice Syrup <p> Organic Oats <p> Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips <p> Peanuts <p> Organic Cocoa Powder <p> Organic Flax Seed Meal <p> Organic Tapioca Flour <p> Organic Coconut Oil <p> Organic Coconut Sugar Crystals <p> Non-GMO Sunflower Lecithin <p> Sea Sale <p> Vanilla Extract <p> Organic Cinnamon <p> Whew . I 'm getting a little mouth-watering going on even typing that beautiful list ! I truly believe that this is one of the most well-designed protein bar recipes around . In fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own special protein balls at home except these G2G Bars actually taste WAY better ! - <p> A few things I want to touch on , that span both positive and ( possibly ) negative : - <p> Protein : At 18 grams of protein per bar , Good 2 Go has done an awesome job of creating a protein bar that actually packs some muscle growth/recovery benefits . All too often you 'll see a protein bar with like 5 grams of protein . But 18- now that 's legit . And it 's high-quality whey isolate to boot ! <p> Calories : Ok , so Quest bars are 120 calories . But they were also made in a lab and you KNOW there 's some real chemically stuff goin ' on in there . I mean . You do n't get booted from Whole Foods for no reason . Do n't get me wrong I love Quest Bars as much as the next chick , but I 'm getting to the point where I 'll take the extra calories and have a REAL FOOD bar . At 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to scarf four of these in a row ( which is VERY doable cause they taste so darn good ! ) <p> Sugar : Ah , the old elephant in the room . It rears it 's head anytime you taste something that seems like it might taste too good to be healthy ' . Do n't get me wrong , I still classify G2G as SUPER healthy , but they DO have a decent amount of sugar . Now . I 'm no sugar-phobe .

That syntax usually goes like this- first thing I 'll do is talk about the brand in question , how I came about their products , etc . The second thing I 'll do is talk about the product performance : that 's where I 'll answer the question you 're probably here to know which is Does Lipocide Work ? ' .

Let 's get the review started ! <p> Welcome to my very special one hour Evogen Carnigen review . In this in-depth analysis I 'm going to go top-to-bottom on this unique fat loss / pre workout supplement . I 'm going to categorize this as more of a stim-free pre workout because the instructions advise to take the product before you work out . I think this is the right way to do things because of it 's powdered from too . It just looks like a pre workout ! That being said , there is often more than meets the eye with these types of products . For example , my Onward energy drink review is a perfect example of what happens when a product just seems to have an identity crisis . It can be hard to know what the product is supposed to even do . But with Carnigen it is pretty clear that the purpose of this powdered fat burner is to , well , burn fat . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat burner . BOOM . How 's that ? We 'll just call it a pre workout fat burner . As with all my reviews I 'll start this one off with a little bit of comedic off-the-hip chit-chat about what 's going on in my life . I 'll follow that up with some thoughts on the flavor and taste of Evogen Carnigen . How DOES this stuff taste ? I 'll tell you . After that we 'll discuss the benefits and effects- meaning we 're going to bascially find out if Evogen works . We will then move into the supplement facts review where we take a look under the hood at what is in this supplement .

@@90028081 @5528081/ <h> Momentum Catalyst Review : Looks Brutal , Performs Beautifully <p> What is Momentum Catalyst pre workout and who is it good for ? That 's what I 'm going to answer for you in this , my second Momentum Nutrition product review . There are a things I know about . Pre workouts happen to be one of them . And when I tell you I know about them , let me be very clear . I REALLY know about them . This is my ninety-seventh pre workout review , and you can be assured that I know my stuff by now . I mean . How can anyone even argue with me at this point ? I 'm SO close to a hundred that I can taste it . Speaking of taste- that is one of the important factors that we 'll discuss in this Momentum Catalyst review . I have found this product pretty enjoyable in that regard . But does it work ? Well . You 're in luck because I 'm going to cover that as well ! I 'm even going to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging by the time all is said and done in this Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Review . So if you 're ready for a super-fun , super-entertaining pre workout review , I think you and I are going to get along just fine over the next hour . Let 's jump in . <p> Momentum Nutrition is n't the first small-time ' company that I 've chosen to review , and it wo n't be the last . I 'm starting to really enjoy working on these smaller companies because they seem to have more character versus something bigger and more mature ' like a Muscletech or even an Optimum Nutrition . Now as you know from my Momentum Nutrition Formula 56 review , I 'm already kind of a Momentum Nutrition fangirl . While I was n't crazy about the packaging , I did actually lose some fat over the two week stretch that I was taking the product . So you can bet when I found out about their pre workout Catalyst , I was pretty jazzed . So . Is it as good as the fat burner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Flavor Grade : 8.5 <p> Sort of a ho-hum start for for Catalyst . The flavor that I tried was peach mango , and it was , well , a pretty good flavor experience . It was n't something where I felt compelled to snapchat everybody that I know about it , but I thought it was very drinkable . With the peach mango flavor , I think they could have actually named it mango peach ' instead , because what you have is a product that starts out with a ton more peach ' taste instead of mango . There are definite notes of peach , do n't get me wrong , but what hits your taste buds FIRST is certainly the mango . I liked how this pre workout mixes . There are n't any clumps or anything like that to speak of , which is rare for pre workout . Usually you have some mixability issues where there seems to be a frothy sort of texture at the very top . But Catalyst was not like that . If I had to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should have added just a TOUCH more sweetness . I think the level of fruit and the level of sour were on point , but could 've been bumped up just a little bit to make for a more balanced taste . Speaking of balanced . Let me tell you how the product worked out for me in the gym. - <h> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Performance Grade:8.9 <p> Ok now we are getting somewhere . Catalyst performs above the line ' , so to speak . That 's the term we use for a product that stands out from the pack on it 's performance . You have a product in Catalyst that give really nice , smooth energy , while ramping up focus and definitely improving endurance as well . I think there are products out there that beat out Catalyst on endurance , but I think when you take in ALL elements of how Catalyst performs , it comes out very near the top for overall performance . <p> I took Catalyst before doing a sort of hodge-podge workout consisting of a one mile ( sprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then another one mile sprint . I think for weight-training I would have had an even BETTER experience with Momentum Nutrition Catalyst . But I 'll have to save that for another time . Like tomorrow . But really a one mile sprint is a high enough intensity level for you to get a really good idea of what this pre workout can do when it comes to performance . I loved how good I felt right from the get-go . I felt like I could have really conquered just about anything at that moment . Just like Formula 56 , Catalyst does a really splendid job of boosting your energy and focus levels to a place where they probably have never been . I love how strong mentally I became , and how I was literally able to knock out my mile run super quickly . I loved it. - <p> I think the only thing keeping me from really bumping Catalyst pre workout up into the A ' range in this section would have to be the endurance . It did n't disappoint me in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do end up giving Catalyst a try , I would probably advise making sure you get some good pre workout calories to boost up the endurance effects . But let 's see what ingredients are in Momentum Nutrition Catalyst to give it the positive effects. - <h> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Formula Grade : 8.9 <p> Another ALMOST ' grade for Catalyst . But . Nothing to be ashamed of in the least . You guys know I am literally the toughest supplement critic in the world when it comes to pre workout . So a sliver below an A ' is actually something to take great pride in . Here is the full list of ingredients in Momentum Nutrition Catalyst : - <p> - <p> The thing that I love most about this ingredient deck is the BIG dosage of beta-alanine . You do n't get that in too too many pre workouts because it definitely does give that itchiness that others do n't . But . It does help with energy and endurance . <p> The second really great thing about this formulation is the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much betaine anhydrous to their formulation . Betaine really helps with overall performance of your workout , starting with the energy and extending to strength and endurance. - <p> And then finally , the energy complex in Catalyst is super well done . I 've always been a fan of both L-theanine as well as hordenine , and of course caffeine is my all-time bae . If you are looking for a pre workout that gives good reliable , smooth energy , I think Catalyst will be right up your alley . <p> The last thing to note on ingredients is that their ARE some artificial flavors and sweeteners in the product . But really I do n't think it 's a big deal . For me personally do I try to LIMIT the artificial stuff ? Sure . But when it comes to pre workout , a little sucralose is n't a huge cause for concern for me . But let 's talk packaging now. - <h> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Packaging Grade : 7.8 <p> Ok I do n't want to seem like TOO much a broken record here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out pretty thoroughly in yesterday 's Formula 56 fat burner review . But this product suffers from something that I like to call packaging boredom . BUT . I did give Catalyst pre workout a slightly higher grade than it 's fat burning family-member because I think Catalyst is visually at least a LITTEL bit better-looking than Formula 56 . Here 's something to notice about Catalyst packaging . THere 's a big fun triangle that 's blue . Lol . But no really , look ! It 's kind of cool . I suppose in the world of the blind , the one-eyed man is King , and I think I may be damning by faint praise , but since the rest of the label is SO boring , the blue triangle is at least SOMETHING to look at and stimulate the eyes . Lol . Stimulate the eyes . That sounds weird . But it 's true . My eyes are stimulated by it . I think the little gray boxes with their ingredient amounts are also notable . Not incredibly good-looking , but at least notable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how , but a colored box is n't enough . So . Overall just too plain , but maybe that 's what helps Momentum differentiate itself as the cleaner supplement brand . Le 's wrap things up. - <h> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Review Summary : - <p> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Flavor Grade : 8.5 <p> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Performance Grade : 8.9 <p> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Formula Grade : 8.9 <p> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Packaging Grade : 7.8 <p> Momentum Nutrition Catalyst Value Grade : 9.4 <p> I think Momentum definitely has reason to be excited about where their brand is going .

But in this day and age , it 's kind of hard for me to trust what the companies put for reviews on their OWN website . So I of course decided to take it on myself to buy some of this stuff and post my own complete review . In this Matefit review , I will grade the product across three different criteria . Er . Four . Sorry . Bear with me on this one as this is actually the first of my detox tea reviews . So the first category will of course be the taste . We 'll talk about the flavors , aromas , and more . You know I am a very poetic person , So I 'm hoping you will enjoy each flavor-journey ' that I bring you on . My mission is to give you the sense that you are right there next to me , sharing my MateFit tea . Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the taste we will get a little technical and discuss the ingredients and types of tea used . In this part of the review the goal is to simply go over the different types of tea in the product so that you know what to expect in terms of results . Speaking of results , that is what we 'll talk about next in the Matefit Review . Does Matefit ACTUALLY WORK ? That 's what we 'll focus much of the review on . I 'll conclude with a packaging and branding grade , before ending the review by assigning the final score . So let 's jump right in to my first ever Matefit Tea Review ! <p> MateFit Ingrediens and Tea Analysis : - <p> The type of tea is important if you really want to know what to expect from your detox tea in terms of results . Now . I 've been drinking green tea for years , and always have had some , well , to be honest , inconsistent results from it . I 've always been from the school of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way more than your supplementation or tea intake . So if you 're exercising right and eating healthfully , it does n't really matter if you 're tea-toxing ' or not . But since I actually am trying to lose some weight I was really hoping that this TeaTox would work out really well for me . <p> So this is an interesting blend for a number of reasons . The first cool thing that stood out to me right away is the inclusion of the guarana . Guarana seeds have about twice the amount of caffeine as coffee beans , so this is going to add some serious energy to the tea. - <p> The next ingredient of interest is Pinhead Gunpowder Tea . This is a form of chinese green tea that unfurls when you steep the tea . It has tremendous flavor and a high concentration of catechins. - <p> Here are the ingredients for the DETOX formula of MateFit : <p> Dandelion Root <p> Peppermint Loos Leaf Tea <p> Rosmeary Leaf <p> Senna Leaf <p> Cinnamon Powder <p> Ginger Root <p> Hibiscus Flower Powder <p> Rhubarb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matefit Tea Detox formula is pretty standard in terms of the ingredients . You will notice that the dandelion root is the number one listed ingredient . Dandelion Root is commonly used as a toxin-removing ingredient and is going to do most of the heavy-lifting in this product . I know grapefruit also has some detoxification properties , so that is interesting to see that one in here as well. - <p> So those are the ingredients and technical information , but does Matefit work ? - <h> Does Matefit Tea Work ? - <p> This is the most important question , and probably the reason you are here . Does Matefit actually help you lose weight and get a flatter abdomen ? .. As it says on the website ? - <p> I must say that I had my doubts . As someone that usually takes traditional fat loss supplements , I am used to seeing results very , very quickly . In all my fat burner reviews I usually take them for a span of two weeks , and then am able to get a really good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with Matefix , I actually ended up taking it for four weeks- as prescribed by Matefix : I took the Metabolic Booster twice per day , and then the Detox Tea every other night after dinner . Here are the results ' that I saw by week : - <p> Week 1 : Ok one week into TeaTox ! I think MateFix HAS done something for me , and that is improve my energy levels . I do n't really like the added caffeine in my diet since I tend to take pre workout supplements every day to help me power through my workout , but I 've made sacrifices and only take half my pre workout . But MateFit has seemed to help energize me at work which is nice . <p> Week 2 : I still feel very energetic at work . I 'm starting to be a little hesitant on the Detox ' side of things . I 'm not going to lie I went to a holiday part the other night and then tried to take the Detox tea the day after because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ended up getting the worst stomachache EVER . Do NOT take the DETOX tea as a hangover cure . It was so horrible . Also , I 'm not so sure if this MateFit tea actually helps you lose weight . I have seen virtually no weight loss. - <p> Week 3 : Ok , I 've pretty much stopped taking the Detox tea at this point . I still take the Metabolic Booster one , but the Detox Tea just does n't seem to agree with my stomach . I would say if you have a sensitive stomach be very cautious about taking the detox tea . In terms of fat/weight loss , I still have n't had any result from MateFit. - <p> Week 4 : Maybe , MAYBE I 've seen a tiny bit of fat loss after an entire month of making this tea . To be honest , I do n't know if TeaTox-ing is for me . It 's a little bit of a hassle to go through the process of making tea two , or sometimes three times a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's what it tastes like : - <h> MateFit Flavor Review : - <p> DETOX : The detox tea tastes very , VERY strongly . I do n't know if I was making the tea too strong or maybe letting it steep for too long , but to me this one was really sort of strong to the point of being unpleasant . It tastes minty , and a little bit citrus-y . I was adding honey to it , but still was n't crazy about the flavor. - <p> METABOLIC BOOSTER : The Metabolic Booster Tea was a little better-tasting of the two Matefit teas . This one had a more traditional Tea ' taste , which makes sense since it is an actual tea whereas the detox one was more of an herbal . But the Metabolic Boosting Matefit tea had a nice taste . It was a cross between traditional Yerba Mate taste , which is kind of sharp and nutty , and a classic green tea , which is strong and smooth . I added some lemon , and some splenda to my MateFit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discuss the MateFit Packaging Now . <h> MateFit Packaging and Branding Score : 7.3 <p> I am sort of new to the TeaTox ' game , but I am very excited to start to add more of these tea reviews to my site . One of the biggest reasons for that excitement is that these companies are much better at branding than the traditional supplements that I 'm used to reviewing . The traditional supplements are usually dressed in black and pink , and have horrible graphical design totally devoid of any tastefulness . But Teas are different . More subdues shades , smoother lines , overall better aesthetics separate the Tea industry from the supplement industry. - <p> Except . MateFit is not the best jumping-off point to showcase this . Matefit , as far as detox teas are concerned , is the ugly duckling of Teas . First of all I do n't know who chose neon orange and neon yellow for the pouches . They look like they are made out of the material that construction workers wear to work on the roads so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matefit ' is plastered over a hideous black strip that runs across the top portion of the pouches . There are generic leaf graphics that seem to have been planted across the package as an afterthought . It 's really not a good looking design . The white type is hard to read when it is reversed out in front of the yellow and orange bags . Overall I 'm pretty un-impressed with the Matefit packaging . They can make it so much better . SO much better. - <h> Matefit Detox Review Summary : <p> MateFit Performance / Effectiveness : 7.3 <p> MateFit Ingredients Score : 8.2 <p> MateFit Flavor Score : 8.4 <p> MateFit Packaging and Branding Score : 7.3 <p> MateFit Value Score : 8.1 <p> The hype for Teatox 28 Days Tea Ultimate Weight Loss Tea by Matefit exceed the results in my experience . I do n't know if maybe I 'm spoiled by the more effective results of traditional fat burners , or what . But I did n't lose one pound taking this tea . That 's not to say that I dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metabolic Booster tea at work because it made me super productive at work . But so does coffee . It will be interesting to try some more of these teas and see if any of the others can outperform Matefit . But I 'll give this product a B ' overall . It 's not terribly pricey , and might be worth trying. * <p> - <h> Matefit TeaTox Final Score : 8.1 B- <p> Hi , my name is Allie and this blog is my hobby : ) I am passionate about being fit and active , so making a blog about my experience with different products that help me stay healthy made sense to me . Please contact me at any time if you would like to guest post or advertise on-site ! Thanks for visiting : ) - 
@@90028083 @5528083/ <p> Myokem Pyroxamine reviews are my new specialty . You want to know why I say that ? Because I can read the future , and the review that you are about to read is going to blow you away . I can promise you a few things in this time we have together . The first is that you are going to be entertained . That 's right . You wo n't find another supplement reviewer who brings the same amount of passion to the review table than me . The other thing I can promise you is that you are going to know everything about Myokem Pyroxamine . Other than how to spell it because I think I 've spelled it two different ways already- both of them wrong , LOL . But , spelling aside , you will know everything ELSE about Pyroxamine . What do I mean by that ? Well , the first thing that I 'm going to tell you , in case you are in a hurry and wo n't care the rest of my rambling , is IF PYROXAMINE WORKS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell the future , AND read minds . You are here because you probably want to drop a few pounds . Like me , maybe you 've had a rough stretch of work , working out , and if you 're REALLY like me you may have had a rough stretch of dating as well . I swear that has only contributed to my , er , slighly weight gain over the past three weeks . Because relationship issues lead to more wine consumption which leads to more pizza consumption which leads to weight gain . It 's not rocket science , people . So I 'll tell you how the last two weeks have gone for me as I 've tried to pull my life ( aka my body ) back together with the help of Myokem . After that I 'll spend some time talking about the formula and also the packaging , but I want to focus on the effects . So let 's get started right away with this Myokem Pyroxamine Review .
