It 's not only cheaper than the price tag that came with the first fight , but also the cheapest high-profile PPV event offered since Terence Crawford 's 12-round whitewash of Viktor Postol last summer , a positive sign that the sport is figuring out that the buying public is tired of being bled dry . <p> Then came Friday 's announcement from lead promoter Roc Nation Sports revealing that tickets are officially on sale for the June 17 event at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas , Nevada . <p> Prices range from $105 all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low end is nearly double the price of the cheapest ticket ( $55 ) from the first fight , while the most expensive seats will cost $200 more than those who paid full price for $1005 front row seats last November . <p> Additional seats in between those prices will run $755 , $505 , $355 and $255 , and are available through axs.com as well as the Mandalay Bay box office . <p> The upcoming light heavyweight clash is a rematch to their competitive first meet , which featured sustained action for 12 rounds followed by a highly questionable unanimous decision in favor of Ward ( 31-0 , 15KOs ) who prevailed by identical scores of 114-113 on all three cards last November at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas . Most viewers and media members believed that Kovalev ( 30-1-1 , 26KOs ) - who floored Ward in round two - won with room to spare , but was instead dealt his first loss and the end of his unified light heavyweight title reign . <p> Commercially , the event was a bit of a bust , selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.3 million from 10,066 tickets sold according to Nevada State Athletic Commission records . <p> The final amounts were enough to satisfy the financial commitment for Kovalev 's side which includes promoter Main Events . As for Roc Nation - whose client Ward boasted a much higher demand - the event remained yet another learning lesson that their team continues to ignore when it comes to moving on to the next show . <p> Ward - a former World super middleweight champion - will attempt the first defense of his light heavyweight titles . The win was preceded by three non-title fights for the unbeaten fighting pride of the California Bay Area , who is also the last American male boxer to capture Olympic Gold which he achieved in the 2004 Athens Games . <p> Kovalev enters the fight as an unbelted challenger for the first time since his ringwalk prior to his destruction of Nathan Cleverly inside of four rounds in their Aug.

The bouts did little to generate interest for the PPV event , as both boxers - while recognized as among the very best in the world ( and in fact #1 and #2 on FightNights.com Top 10 Pound-for-Pound list ) - have yet to translate their ring attributes into star power . <p> It does n't figure to change for the better leading into the rematch in June , although credit is given for their cutting straight to the chase rather than attempting to further marinate . <p> Time will tell if the public will respond and meet event handlers ' lofty expectations this go-round.

Meet The Press ( And Thousands Of Fans , Too ) <p> If the showdown between Saul ' Canelo ' Alvarez and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr . feels like little more than a massive money grab opportunity , word apparently did n't make its way to Mexico . <p> Even beyond the hundreds of media members covering the event were thousands of fans in Mexico City for the first day of the four-city press tour to promote the aforementioned clash , which takes place May 6 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas , Nevada . The HBO Pay-Per-View headliner - which will be contested at a catchweight of 165 lbs . - will be promoted in a similar format in New York City , Houston and Los Angeles in the coming days . <p> First up , though , was the opportunity for two of Mexico 's most iconic figures of this generation to shake hands with the adoring public . The event was well-celebrated , with an overwhelming sense of pride to be found among all participants . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polemic fighters , " Alvarez ( 48-1-1 , 34KOs ) said of the upcoming attraction . " There have been a lot of comments directed towards me and my character , and I fight for pride to represent my country . " <p> The latter statement is a clear response to public outcry over his continuing to move sideways regarding a desired clash with unbeaten , unified middleweight titlist Gennady Golovkin . The two were due to fight after Alvarez dethroned Miguel Cotto to win the World ( lineal ) and WBC middleweight crown , but the red-headed superstar instead opted for a voluntary defense first versus Amir Khan , whom he knocked out cold in six rounds in their 155 lb. catchweight bout last May . <p> Post-fight commentary included his insistence of facing Golovkin next , only for Alvarez to vacate his middleweight title and drop down one pound to the official super welterweight limit . There , he reclaimed a portion of the divisional crown , stopping England 's Liam Smith in nine rounds to ignite a second title reign at the weight . <p> He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously he first has to get past Chavez Jr. , but the promise made by Alvarez and promoter Oscar de la Hoya was that a Sept . ' 17 showdown with Golovkin absolutely had to happen . That would mean a formal move to the full middleweight limit , as Golovkin seems disinterested in negotiating any more catchweight scenarios . <p> Despite previous claims of having to grow into a full middleweight uniform , Alvarez opted to leapfrog the division altogether in pursuing an in-country rivalry matchup more than five years in the making . It meant giving away a lot in natural size , although a risk for which he has already begun preparation . <p> " It 's a new weight , so I have started to spar with heavier partners , which everyone will notice come fight night , " Alvarez insists .

At the very least , however , there has been the demand for at least self-respect , as Chavez Jr . has come across as a spoiled entity who has never taken his own career seriously . Eating his way out of weight classes , failed drug tests and a reputation for not giving even a half-hearted effort in training camp will do that to a man . <p> To his credit , the former middleweight titlist recognizes that - despite previously insisting that he will get it right the next time around - eventually comes the day when you run out of chances at redemption . <p> " I 've been making my way to this fight . My last fight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who outpointed super middleweight contender Dominick Britsch last December .

The fight could not have come at a more perfect timing - both my and Canelo 's names are known throughout the world as some of the best fighters . My two losses against Martinez and Fonfara taught me more than all 50 of my wins . This fight has the potential to open many doors to my future that might have been closed before .

The announcement of the fight drew excitement from boxing fans across the world but especially in the United States where ever since the Mayweather-Pacquiao debacle people have lost their interest in Boxing . Mainstream media have gone as far as to latch on to a circus act involving Floyd Mayweather taking on a UFC fighter in the boxing ring . While Canelo-Golovkin will not draw the attention or numbers that Mayweather-McGregor will it is definitely a super-fight between two actual boxers that mainstream media can turn at least some what of a focus to . <p> The biggest question surrounding Canelo-Golovkin right now is where is this fight going to take place ?

It is very possible that the fight can pack all 100,000 seats to fill the stadium .

They could set an historic record for attendance and listen to 100,000 fans cheer in a super-fight . If they manage to sell it out media outlets across the U.S will show interest drawing more and more eyes to the sport of Boxing and maybe make some new fans in a sport that is fading away in the United States . <p> Unfortunately there are also limitations in doing the fight here , mainly falling on the fans . Most would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to watch it on the mega jumbotron inside of the stadium . A boxing ring is very small and fans will have a bird 's eye view from most of the seats . As far as pre-fight and post-fight parties and things to do , there is n't going to be much around . Celebrities will be scarce and as far as Jerry Jones being able to compete with Vegas 's money when it comes to pricing tickets , Golden Boy and K2 Promotions will likely be taking less money for this site due to ticket sales likely not matching the high prices they can charge in Vegas . <p> LAS VEGAS : <p> The spectaculars surrounding a major Boxing event in Las Vegas is indeed something special . The city itself glows greater than it already does on a big fight weekend . For those attending the fight there are hundreds of things to do both before and after the event .

Having the fight here will set not any historic records or draw more eyes to the fight . It 's just another major fight in Las Vegas . While that 's not a bad thing it wo n't open people'e eyes up to the sport .

In order to get noticed and to create buzz one has to win big fights . Big tough fights . For Crawford , all of those fights lie at 147 , a weight division above him . That division is filled with talented fighters that Crawford could try to beat and create a buzz around his name . Beating guys like Ray Beltran , Dierry Jean , Thomas Dulmore , and Hank Lundy is n't going to excel a career . <p> In order for Crawford to be a PPV Superstar that some people out there think he can be a lot his going to have to change .

Also taken into consideration is the ridiculous level of piracy that exists in today 's boxing market , with Facebook 's Live feature making it all too simple to share such events . While it 's difficult to determine how many additional viewers would have purchased the event in the absence of an illegal feed , it certainly does n't help on the promotional end . <p> As much was evident with two PPV events last November .

Given the ridiculous insurance requirements put in place by the New York State Athletic Commission in order to greenlight Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) events beginning in 2016 , the boxing club show circuit has all but dried up , forcing promoters such as DiBella to hit the road in order to keep the roster of boxers active . <p> While the state of affairs in New York would n't quite affect the New Orleans-rooted , Houston-based rising prospect as much as DiBella 's other clients , Prograis - whose last bout happened to take place in Brooklyn last June - was denied an avenue to pick up stay-busy fights at a time when opportunities on Showtime 's ShoBox series were n't coming as often as had previously been the case . <p> The other issue was his looking so good in several previous Showtime appearances , that outgoing phone calls were ultimately going straight to voice main in terms of finding willing opposition . <p> " I 'm not the problem here , " Prograis said of the struggles to making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been able to do even as they kept raising the bar , now all of a sudden everyone who claiming they 're willing to take on the best suddenly forget how to say my name or even acknowledge me . " <p> Prograis enjoyed a huge breakout campaign in 2015 , scoring dominant wins over previously unbeaten opponents on Showtime in back-to-back bouts . The road began with an eight-round shutout of Amos Cowart ( 11-0-1 at the time ) in August ' 15 , shining bright in his televised debut - quite a statement considering the night also including big wins by a trio of bone-crunching middleweights in Sergiy Derevyanchenko , Avtandil Khurtsidze and Ievgen Khytrov . <p> Four months later came his statement-making arrival , tearing through previously unbeaten Abel Ramos in forcing an 8th round stoppage atop a Dec. ' 15 ShoBox quadrupleheader at home in Houston . The hope from there was that 2016 would feature at least one fight that would move him within title contention , but instead became a rough year for stateside boxing as a whole . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over fringe contenders Alan Herrera and Luis Florez ) for the sake of staying active , but it was a shame the year had to go like that because I know I 'm ready for anyone in the world , " Prograis insists . " Then to go all those months without a fight - it was n't easy , but I just kept cool knowing that Lou Dibella and ( manager ) Jay Johns had everything under control and that better days and bigger things would come . " <p> It led in part to DiBella scouring the country looking for available dates - whether on or off TV - while moving one of his top prospects into the role of a top contender . <p> " I 've always appreciated dealing with Lou DiBella , " Prograis states . " More than just being a great promoter , he 's a great man . We kept in contact and he assured me that everything would be taken care of in my career . He 's always kept his word with me . " <p> A win over Buelvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next level , but it does serve as the chance to shake off any accrued ring rust and at least return to where he left off prior to what became the longest inactive stretch of his four-plus year career . What comes after that , he promises , will be well worth the wait . <p> " Winning a world title this year , that has to happen , " Prograis insists . " This fight is n't about just getting another fight and then looking for opportunities . I 'm taking on this kid ( Saturday night ) because he 's the guy who said yes . We offered the fight to a lot of other ( boxers ) , but they did n't want it . We 're not gon na keep going through that in the future . After this fight , we 're looking at fighting the best at 140 lbs . <p> " When I say the best , I mean the guys who got the belts and the top contenders who are in my way of getting to those champions . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He do n't want to risk that , and I get it - that 's smart of him . So I got my eye on Ricky Burns , on that other guy with a belt ( Julius Indongo , an unbeaten southpaw who faces Burns in a unification bout on April 15 ) - whoever wins that , that 's the fight I want this year . Let it be Ricky Burns , and I 'll go to ( Scotland ) to fight him and bring those belts back here . "

@@37620285 @6620285/ <h> Stevenson-Fonfara Rematch Barely Registers With Home Viewers <p> As Adonis Stevenson 's light heavyweight championship reign has devolved into a joke , so too has his televised ratings . <p> The latest sign of how insignificant his once-promising career has become surfaced in the form of his June 3 rematch with Andrzej Fonfara . The championship bout - in which Stevenson scored a 2nd round stoppage in their Showtime-televised main event live from the Bell Centre in Montreal , Canada - drew an average just 390,000 viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . <p> Fittingly , the poor ratings reflect the lack of support to be found among the majority of boxing fans and media alike who deemed the rematch largely unnecessary . The average was more than 40% lower than their first fight three years ago almost to the day , with both boxers hitting the deck before Stevenson prevailed by unanimous decision in a far more competitive affair in his first headlining bout out Showtime after having been previously showcased on HBO . <p> Missing from the rematch - aside from any general interest - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonfara has since suffered a 1st round knockout loss to Joe Smith Jr . last June and struggled mightily in a 10th round stoppage of a badly faded Chad Dawson earlier this year in being given a second shot at Stevenson and a world title .

That very win was among a four-win campaign - all by knockout - in 2013 in being hailed by many outlets as Fighter of the Year . <p> He was also being groomed for a light heavyweight unification clash with then-unbeaten titlist Sergey Kovalev , as both were being regularly showcased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torched by Stevenson , who decided to jump ship and sign with adviser Al Haymon , taking his services to Showtime , CBS and Spike TV during his three years with the high-powered boxing mogul . <p> His once rabid viewing fan base has n't quite followed , going from regularly pulling in well north of one million viewers to present-day form , where the industry simply could n't care less about his next move if it does n't involve a quality opponent in the opposite corner . His lone bout to match his strong HBO ratings came in the very first edition of Premier Boxing Champions on CBS , drawing 1.6 million viewers during a Saturday matinee edition for a 12-round win over Sakio Bika atop a telecast that was packaged with the network 's NCAA college basketball Final Four coverage . <p> The rematch with Fonfara was just his third fight since the network appearance , fighting twice on Spike TV including a highlight reel 4th round knockout of then-Top 10 contender Thomas Williams Jr . last July .

The two are due to collide on May 6 in Auckland , New Zealand , but Team Parker openly questioned why his opponent and his team would n't have traveled abroad from England well in advance of his first career title fight . <p> " He 's not even here yet and hopefully they do come , " Parker ( 22-0 , 18KOs ) stated to a group of reporters during a brief conference shortly after his arrival in country Saturday morning .

" It seems the problem lies within Team Fury . " <p> Fury ( 20-0 , 10KOs ) was due to enter his first career title fight , but that is very much up in the air as this goes to publish .

In regards to traveling to Australia , there were concerns over Fury 's father and head trainer Peter being able to secure a travel visa due to his past criminal record , although that issue was resolved . <p> Then arose demands for better travel accommodations than what was offered , although Team Parker does n't quite grasp what more could have been done other than personally escort Team Fury onto a plane from England to Australia . <p> " We made an offer to them a while back that they could come out here six weeks before the fight , " Kevin Barry , Parker 's no-nonsense head trainer pointed out on Saturday .

" <p> For now , Parker is proceeding as if he will still fight on May 6 , an event he insists will mark his last call - at least for the time being - in New Zealand . The hope was that with a win , he would begin his world tour in searching for the best possible heavyweight fights , including potential unification clashes with Deontay Wilder or the winner of the April 29 clash between Klitschko and unbeaten IBF titlist Anthony Joshua . <p> Should his bout with Fury go on as planned , the next step would be to ensure that his opponent - whose team is due to host a press conference in Auckland on Wednesday , April 26 - gives himself every chance of emerging victorious . <p> " He 's never done jet-lag before , so for someone who has n't done it before , they should be down here acclimatising to the time and all sorts of stuff like that , " Parker says of Fury .

The visiting Mexican slugger scored a knockdown moments before battering the local favorite in forcing the stoppage . <p> Por Chokchai and his team told anyone who would listen that the 25-year old Thai fly(weight) guy was ready for the challenge , despite being elevated into such a lofty position without ever having faced a warm body .

Danny Garcia and Keith Thurman collide in a battle unbeaten welterweight titlists - just the third such scenario in the history of the storied division . Their battle headlines live in primetime on CBS from Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York . <p> Round 1 : Both boxers force a torrid pace right out the gate . Thurman is far more aggressive than in recent past , undoubtedly motivated by his genuine disdain for his opponent . Cool and poised , Garcia creates distance and boxes wisely while offering Thurman angles . He failed to land the necessary equalizer to keep the Floridian at bay , however , and Thurman makes him pay in a big way .

Thurman enjoyed big moments in the opening two rounds but was thoroughly outboxed - and outfought - in these three minutes . Thurman was wide with his punches , playing directly into Garcia 's attack as he landed right hands upstairs and a tide-turning left hook to the body . <p> Round 4 : Thurman regains control of the fight , as Garcia struggles to keep his harder-hitting foe at a desired distance . Boxing from the Philly native not getting the job done in this round , as Thurman crisper with his punches and forcing Garcia to stop punching on several occasions . <p> Round 5 : Garcia remains in the pocket , attempting to get Thurman to miss wildly and then counter with a straight right or left hook upstairs . It 's a risky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the round . Thurman tries to work behind his jab , but just too tempted to turn a boxing match into a slugfest .

Garcia serves as the aggressor for the first time in the fight , while Thurman offers lateral movement in looking to land from the outside . Not much to choose from in the first two minutes , but Garcia has the stronger finish down the stretch as Thurman fails to set up his power shots with his jab , a flaw of which trainer Dan Birmingham reminds him in between rounds . <p> Round 7 : Thurman is the busier of the two , but not necessarily the more effective .

Most of them miss , but he gets through a couple of left hooks and a right uppercut that momentarily shuts down Garcia 's movement and forces him to alter his strategy . <p> Round 10 : Controversy seems to be creeping closer and closer in as the bout appears destined to go to the scorecards . Thurman employing Birmingham 's gameplan , boxing smartly and not wasting any punches . Garcia also wisely picking his shots , waits out a 30-second drill from Thurman to land some body shots along the way and a clean left hook upstairs just before the bell . <p> Round 11 : Strangely little happening in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to steal it and where Garcia appears to be hopelessly behind . Not much to choose from , as Garcia slightly busier while Thurman 's lateral movement causes him fits . <p> Round 12 : Garcia finally opens up his attack , but his inability to cut off the ring was his biggest hindrance tonight , Thurman took a risk in strictly boxing down the stretch , as history has proven no lead is ever too safe . Garcia lands a series of body shots along the ropes in the final minute - perhaps enough to win the round , but needed so much more to overcome the early deficit in the court of public opinion .

@@37620318 @6620318/ <h> Canelo-Golovkin : It All Falls On De La Hoya <p> One week after middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin won a hardly contested fight against Danny Jacobs people could not hold their tongues as the debate on a Canelo-Golovkin showdown is hotter than ever . Most feel Canelo will easily win his May 6th fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr setting up the mega-fight that the fans have been begging before since May of 2016 . While negotiations have been lackluster over the last six months , a September showdown has been promised by both sides time and time again . <p> That said , it would appear as though one side is making it harder , yet again . Golden Boy Promotions President Oscar De La Hoya , who many put the full blame on for a Canelo-Golovkin fight not taking place in May or September of 2016 , has gone on record this week stating two things that have made many people outlash at him and once again making it seem as though Golden Boy and Canelo want nothing to do with Golovkin inside of the squared circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Hoya stated that he will be pulling the offer that they have on the table for Golovkin and revising it . De La Hoya believes that Golovkin is n't the draw they thought , or so he says , and that a new offer needs to be proposed . That likely means a lower offer than Golovkin had . In case you have n't been following the story team Golovkin was not keen on the $10-$15 million dollar flat fee offer that Golden Boy had proposed . Team Golovkin has been sitting on the offer though , never turning it down , but trying to get a better one that includes a percentage of everything the event has to offer . Another roadblock , that Oscar De La Hoya is now claiming , is that he does n't want Golovkin to fight June 10th . Golovkin is planning on taking on fellow middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders in Kazakhstan on June 10th . To anyone that has followed Golovkin 's career he is accustomed to fighting 3-4 times a year . He does n't like waiting six months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Golovkin fights June 10th then they will not be able to proceed with a September bout . De La Hoya claims that there is n't enough time to promote the fight . He also claims that Golovkin could get injured , or lose . <p> At this point it 's very hard to tell if Oscar De La Hoya wants Canelo to fight Golovkin at all . There is the belief that he is trying to hold it off for as long as he can so that Golovkin gets old and Canelo has a better chance of winning . There is also the belief that De La Hoya believes if he keeps on pushing the fight back like Mayweather-Pacquiao , that the fight will eventually produce record breaking PPV numbers . However , the common belief is that Oscar De La Hoya does n't want Canelo anywhere near Golovkin because Golovkin will beat him and when that happens Golden Boy loses it 's biggest profit maker . It is a thought that is baffling since losing one fight does n't stop someone from being a star . Ask Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiasco there has been one common denominator that many put the blame on . Oscar De La Hoya . De La Hoya has come up with excuse after excuse as to why Canelo-Golovkin is not happening . It 's gone from weight , to money , to Golovkin is n't a draw , to Golovkin needs to fight someone to prove himself , to it needs time , and now bold enough to even tell Golovkin what he should do while he waits for a contract that may never be good enough . <p> Every excuse Oscar De La Hoya has come up with has been contradicted by himself . Weight was an issue but yet Canelo is fighting at 164 against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr . Golovkin is putting 20K seats in Madison Square Garden each time out against guys that are n't really big draws . That is something that only Miguel Cotto has been able to do . He has now beaten Danny Jacobs who many consider the second best middleweight in the world . It has now been over a year and a half to marinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse situation , which is usually always the hold up in trying to make big fights . <p> The longer this fight waits the more fans will continue to blame Oscar De La Hoya and Canelo for it not happening . Canelo 's reputation has taken a huge hit . Maybe not in terms of selling tickets and PPV 's , which has been pretty consistent over the last 4 years , but it terms of pride . Every time he tweets something people reply with comments like " fight Golovkin " " Your a coward " " Stop being scared of GGG " " Your a diva " and on and on . This is a Mexican fighter who has bravely gotten into the ring against dangerous foes like Erislandy Lara and Austin Trout . Canelo made himself a star by taking the dangerous fights to prove himself to be the best yet the last year and a half of his career has been overshadowed by the perception that he is afraid to step into the ring with Gennady Golovkin . For years Floyd Mayweather got destroyed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle with with a smile . Canelo , however , has shown frustration over it . Being called a coward , or being portrayed as ducking , does n't sit well with him . <p> It 's time for Oscar De La Hoya to put his fears aside and make this fight happen . If Golovkin fights on June 10th and loses then he can scrap the September showdown . Many think that 's all he wants to do anyways so what does it matter if Golovkin loses or gets hurt ? He is not allowed to tell Golovkin that he can not fight . Ninety days is plenty of time to promote a fight . The promotion for this fight started over a year ago anyways . As far as " renegotiating " his original offer . That 's as bogus as an excuse as they come . Golovkin 's number fighting unknown fighters to the casual fan is around the 150K range . Canelo 's number fighting unknown fighters to the casual fan is the 300K range . There 's a good chance Oscar is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Golovkin at the negotiation table as well . That is another bogus move because Chavez Jr still sells , especially against Canelo . If Golovkin had fought Chavez Jr that 150K number would be way higher . Would it be as high as a Canelo-Chavez Jr fight ? No . But no one is arguing that Canelo is n't the A side against Golovkin . The argument is put out a fair number so everyone is happy and the fight can be made . At the end of the day all the fans want to see is the best fight the best . Ironically enough , that has been Oscar 's motto for the last three years . 
@@37620319 @6620319/ <h> Dmitry Bivol : I Want To Stay Active , No Rush To The Top <p> If you were worried about having missed any portion of Dmitry Bivol 's surge toward the top of the light heavyweight division , fear not " there remains plenty of time to still catch a glimpse . <p> Despite fighting for an interim light heavyweight title in just his seventh pro fight , the 26-year old boxer " born in Kyrgyzstan but who came up through the Russia boxing program , where he remains based " had never planned global domination in the infancy of his pro career . Fighting at an accelerated level and through a stream of activity is what remains in the cards , the latest example found in his 10-round clash with Cedric Agnew this Saturday in Las Vegas , barely two months after his U.S. TV debut . <p> " The plan was never to go slow , but never also to go right to the top , " Bivol ( 10-0 , 8KOs ) explains to FightNights.com of his intended career arc . " We wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best guys . " <p> The latter formula is reserved for the likes of Ukraine 's Vasyl Lomachenko , arguably the greatest amateur boxer of all time who fought for a world title in just his second pro fight and became a champ by fight number three . While no slouch in the amateur ranks himself , Bivol " who boasted a record of 268-15 before turning pro in 2014 " preferred to seek experienced opposition while further honing his craft , an art that is still being perfected in this his third year as a prizefighter . <p> It 's why he fights an experienced gatekeeper like Agnew on the HBO Pay-Per-View undercard of the light heavyweight championship rematch between Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev rather than hold out for the winner . <p> " This is a good next step for my career , " Bivol believes . " It 's a chance to show the boxing world my potential in the light heavyweight division , on a show where the two best light heavyweights in the world meet for the second time . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. TV debut , an impressive 4th round knockout of Samuel Clarkson this past April in Oxon Hill , Maryland . Bivol had fought before on U.S. soil , having appeared twice in California six months apart in 2015 and 2016 , but never on an American television outlet . His first impression was lasting , as the ease in which he dispatched of the normally durable Clarkson had viewers longing for more . <p> Wish granted . <p> " After the last fight , Vadim ( Kornilov , Bivol 's manager ) told me there was a chance to fight on this card . I said yes of course , " Bivol reveals . " As long as I can keep ending fights early , then sure I would love to keep fighting every 2-3 month . If I 'm forced to go longer , then we would need to take a break . <p> " The last one did n't go very long , so it 's no problem coming back in two months . " <p> The placement serves a dual purpose as it gives boxing audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , even if not necessarily in the immediate future . <p> " One day , sure I 'd love to fight Andre Ward or Sergey Kovalev , " Bivol admits , although with a disclaimer . " I 'm not ready for that yet , though . I would n't mind fighting ( secondary titlist ) Nathan Cleverly later this year , or someone on that level ( a Top 10 opponent ) . Every fight builds to something bigger . Last fight , I was able to fight in front of a U.S. TV audience . Now I get to fight on HBO ( PPV ) for the first time . <p> " With a win ( on Saturday ) , I 'd love to come back to the U.S. and fight again on TV . It 's one fight at a time for us , so we will see what happens here and determine the next best step . " <p> Saturday 's bout was downgraded to a 10-round non-title fight due to his opponent not being deemed fit to fight 12 rounds in Nevada ( despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days regarding a certain summer event ) . Still , Agnew comes with championship pedigree of sorts , having challenged Kovalev for his light heavyweight title back in 2014 " a fight which resulted in the first loss of his pro career . The 30-year old southpaw sought to bounce back , but was upended two fights later by Clarkson in Feb. ' 15 , having since won two straight versus nondescript opposition . <p> With that , it 's understandable why a commission would refuse to sanction the Chicago-bred boxer in a championship bout versus the likes of Bivol , who boasted a 268-15 amateur record and numerous major tournament wins before bringing his talents to the pro ranks . <p> In any other country , he would have easily qualified for the Olympics . However , Bivol had the misfortune of campaigning in the same weight class as Egor Mekhontsev , a stud amateur and 2012 Olympic Gold medalist but whose pro career has n't quite taken off just yet . <p> Meanwhile , Bivol is already in the conversation when talks turn to the best ten light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see more with each fight and thus expect him to run alongside the likes of Ward , Kovalev or lineal champion Adonis Stevenson sooner rather than later . <p> To that comes the plea of not mistaking advancement for rushing to the top . <p> " Of course I am grateful for any praise from the boxing fans and media , " Bivol admits . " However , I do not feel that just 10 fights is enough to be on that ( elite ) level . I try not to focus on where I 'm ranked and it 's not why I fight the opposition that I do face in the ring . <p> " We are on the course we planned when we turned pro and each fight gets me closer . We want to fight at an advanced pace , but there also has to be patience along with such a journey in order to fully develop and ( ultimately ) succeed . <p> " So for me , a successful 2017 would be to win ( on Saturday ) , then get at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 and then a Top 10 opponent .

This is corporate America at its finest . The flourish in profits is n't enough . Greed sets in . Two employees becomes one , prices rise for customers , and anything that the company can do to make even more money is done so that the expansion of profits continues to rise even if its at the expense of its consumers . <p> Why should the sport of boxing be any different ? 2013 was a breakout year . So why not expose the fans for money money ? Why not line up five PPV fights for the first part of the year and plan another four-six to close it out ?

Since so many fans loved what was happening in the sport why not make them pay more to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights once July had finished . If it werent for the Chavez-Golovkin fallout , July would have actually had two PPV boxing matches only two weeks apart making it six . The fans said they were upset about it , and they tried to voice that they would n't be exposed to it as each fight was being planned . <p> The Promoters and Networks did n't  listen . But they are definitely listening now . Only one fight , the Canelo-Angulo fight , performed at the expected drawing in between 350k-400k buys . The rest of the events underperformed . Pacquiao-Bradley did a below average 750k , Mayweather-Maidana 850k-900k , Canelo-Lara 275k , and the worst and most surprising one of them all , the Cotto-Martinez showdown bringing in a rough 350k . Now most of these are estimates but every single one was projected higher by the promoters and their projections are usually good . Arum was dumbfounded , Showtime Executive Stephen Espinoza went as far to say he was no longer releasing PPV numbers because they were so bad . They could n't understand why the numbers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drew in 2.2 millions viewers may have raised an eyebrow . The ratings that Showtime and HBO were getting for there fights were also making the powers that be think that maybe more PPVs would work . Its no secret that if you put in Mayweather with another young star that many people think could beat him , the fight will sell . Mayweathers " People pay to see me lose " signature quote could n't be more true . The selling point for the Mayweather-Canelo showdown was the boxing fans spreading the word around the country that Mayweather was going to lose to this young upcoming Mexican superstar . For that reason , casual fans paid . Boxing was n't dead . <p> Then came the ultimate problem . Greed . Showtime and Golden Boy wanted Canelo to do his own PPV , Mayweather to follow two months later , and then Canelo to follow again two months later in another PPV . In the meantime Top Rank and HBO got Pacquiao-Bradley II and Cotto-Martinez in between . For some reason they thought this was a good idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $50-$70 dollars . Well , boxing fans do n't  have that type of money . Those numbers showed both Top Rank and Golden Boy that they will not be exposed . <p> For that exact reason we are down to just two PPV fights lined up for the Fall . Funny how things change . Saul Canelo Alvarez and Golden Boy have announced that Canelos November fight will not be on PPV . Top Rank and HBO have announced that Cottos December fight will not be on PPV . If you need to know whether or not money was being made on those early 2014 PPVs , well the answer is right there . The idea that more PPVs was what boxing needed failed tremendously . <p> Instead of the expected 4-6 PPV fights that we all thought would happen from September to December this year we are back down to two . Mayweather and Pacquiao . Mayweather and Pacquiao will fight on PPVs for the rest of their boxing lives , no surprise there . But what 's interesting about this is that now the fans only have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year instead of 4-6 . Now , they are more inclined to buy them maybe giving both Mayweather and Pacquiao a boost in their numbers . Golden Boy and Top Rank , obviously , know this . Feeding their two biggest stars come first . Sure , Canelo and Cotto have to take to regular television for the time being , but is that a bad thing ? Maybe fore them . Canelo made a lot for that Angulo fight after the PPV revenue came in . I 'm not sure how much Cotto made . But for each one to be ok with just fighting on regular television for their fall returns says a lot . They do n't  have to worry though . A big fight is looming against each other in May that will make both of them tons of money . <p> Less PPVs is a good thing . Its time for HBO and Showtime to start showing better quality fights for free . Their PPV plan for 2014 backfired big time on them and that 's ok . Fans just are n't  paying that much anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sport on the planet , has had horrible numbers for this year . People do n't  want to pay to see fights anymore . They will pay for a big one here and there , and the hardcore fans of each sport will pay for every event , but the casual fans will not dig into those pockets for average fights . They wo n't even dig into them for good fights ( Cotto-Martinez ) . And even the aura around Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is slowly dropping . 850k-900k buys is not what Showtime and Golden Boy want for a guy they are paying $32 million dollars too . 750k buys is not what Arum wants for a guy he is paying $20 million dollars too . Maybe that 's why Arum has been throwing out Mayweathers name again . Maybe that is why Mayweather has been showing glimpses of Manny Pacquiao on All Access . But that 's for another article .

Flanagan adapted and conquered , boxing early until he realized he had to bite down and fight as Petrov was never going to stop coming forward .

The Spain-based Russian also had to contend with a cut over his right eye from an accidental headbutt - hardly uncommon in matchups between southpaws and right-handed boxers - as he went for broke in the 12th and final round . He went for the knockout , but it not only never came but left him open for Flanagan to pick him apart down the stretch in preserving his unbeaten record and title reign . <p> Flanagan advances to 33-0 ( 13KOs ) as he remains champ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Zepeda in June ' 15 , followed up by a career-best performance in torching Diego Magdaleno in two rounds later that October .

Kudryashov did his best to remain disciplined , attempting to establish his jab and keep his opponent at arm 's length just long enough to get off his own big shots . <p> A boxing match just was n't meant to break out , however . Durodola was hell bent on picking up where he left off , with the Kansas-based Nigerian slamming home left hooks and overhand rights .

Our writer Gabriel Gonzalez breaks down how he thinks the second fight is going to play out : <p> There are a couple big factors that play into this second showdown . Referee Kenny Bayless is probably the biggest one though . There is two ways he is going to referee this fight . I 'll call them the " Mayweather way " and the " Maidana way " . The Mayweather way is that every time Maidana gets on the inside and tries to rough Floyd up , Bayless will step in and break them apart . He will now allow the holding and rough house pushing that helped Maidana keep Floyd on the ropes in the first fight to happen this time around . The Maidana way would be that he allows what happened in the first fight to happen in the second fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses the Mayweather way then its going to be an easy night for Floyd . If he chooses the Maidana way then Floyd is in for a round night again . <p> If Bayless does let them fight then the question is can Maidana finish the fight stronger this time around . I ask myself one questionDid Maidana get tired in the first fight or did Floyd figure him out ? The five to six rounds of their first showdown was all Marcos Maidana . He had Floyd flustered , confused , and he was winning rounds . His team says that he got tired in the second part of that fight . This time around their sole focus has been on Maidanas conditioning . They are planning to come in and throw a hundred punches per round . However , I remember them saying that they would do it the first time too . The truth is , its not easy to keep up that pace for twelve rounds no matter how conditioned you are . Maidana has to be smart , aggressive , and throw a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy to do . <p> Maidana has 31 KOs in 35 wins which means this guy has power . However , ever since he moved up to welterweight he has n't  carried that one punch KO power with him . He can knock you down , he can stop you with his relentless attack , but he ca n't end the fight in one punch . I think one thing that is underestimated about Floyd Mayweather is his ability to take a punch . Maidana hit Floyd with a lot of clean shots in the first fight and Floyd was able to take them . He seemed flustered , annoyed , and even tired at times , but he was never hurt . Maidana needs to hurt Floyd this time around . Can he do it ? I 'm not so sure he can . More clean punches need to be landed . Mayweather knows what is coming this time but so does Maidana . Maidana is not scared , he s not going to be as nervous in this fight , and if he has learned some things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that Floyds punches did n't  hurt him so he may risk taking even more chances in this fight by going after him . But if he underestimates Floyd 's power he could get caught . <p> Mayweather needs to do what Mayweather does . In the second part of their first fight even with his back to the ropes Floyd was able to land flush shots without taking to many back from Maidana . He figured out where the punches were coming from and gave himself just enough space to fend him off . The idea this time around would be to keep the fight in the middle of the ring where Maidana stands no chance against Floyd 's speed , timing , and defense . I do n't  see Mayweather being able to do that if referee Kenny Bayless let 's this be a fight . Maidanas continuous pressure and punches forced Floyd to the ropes in that first fight . I think Floyd is going to be on the ropes again alot in this fight and the key will be landing the cleaner shots like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its an intriguing matchup . If Bayless stays out of it its going to another fun fight to watch . If not , then Mayweather will likely cruise to an easy victory . In my opinion , Mayweather wins either way . I do n't  see Maidana hurting Floyd , though he definitely can . The fight will likely play out the same way the first fight did . Mayweather will land the cleaner punches while Maidana makes the fight fun with his continuous onslaught landing punches everywhere and anywhere he can . This time I think Mayweather wins the rounds clearer than he did in the first fight though , which had a lot of close rounds that could have went either way .

Its no wonder why they both found themselves on the Forbes highest paid athletes list over and over again . They have taken the sport of boxing , without any aid from the heavyweight division , and have put it on their backs . They are the life of the sport when it comes to selling PPVs . <p> With that said though , both Mayweather and Pacquiao have a problem as they both look to schedule their 2014 fall opponents in the coming weeks . Mayweathers last fight against Maidana was rumored to bring in less than 900k buys , and Pacquiaos fight against Bradley was estimated at around 750k buys .

Both have proven that they can hit the 1.5 million buy range with a big named opponent . However , for the fall of 2014 , that big named opponent is lacking . Only Miguel Cotto and Saul Canelo Alvarez seem to have enough steam to their names to draw some big numbers , and ironically enough the big match for 2014 is likely to see them square off against each other rather that of Mayweather or Pacquiao . So what 's left for either fighter ? Well with the recent rift in Golden Boy , that 's a question that nobody really knows how to answer . Mayweather has closed the door to Golden Boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents , and its likely they will both end up in rematches that both intrigue and bore the fans : <p> FLOYD MAWEATHER : <p> The undefeated pound for pound champion may be the biggest seller in boxing history when its time to sail into the sunset . His ability to sell a fight with his charismatic personality and undefeated record goes unprecedented . But with a $32 million guarantee , Mayweather needs to draw more than 800-900k buys per fight for himself and Showtime . With Golden Boy out of the picture its up to Mayweather and TMT promotions to promote his next fight . It will be the first time since Mayweather has been a free agent that he will not have Golden Boy behind his promotions . Of the three fights that he has had under his contract only one of them has produced over one million PPV buys . The Canelo fight has them in the green because of a 2.2 million buy rate but they are going to need higher numbers than 900k per fight to keep them there . <p> There 's big problems though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with Golden Boy and Top Rank making his list of opponents scarce .

Cotto works with Top Rank on a fight to fight basis so its likely he s out too . Mayweather is only left with Marcos Maidana or Keith Thurman . But can either of them sell ? The Maidana rematch is the best option but its a risk . Did he really pose enough of a threat in the first fight that will make more people buy the second fight ? Its hard to tell . There were thoughts of Mayweather pushing that September fight back . According to many sources close to Mayweather though , September 13th is going to be a go . Its very likely we get the Maidana rematch on September 13th . <p> One good thing going for Mayweather is that if Canelo beat Lara , and Canelo and Cotto square off in December , Mayweather may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge event , especially if Mayweather can make history by fighting for the middleweight title .

With a PPV system in place in China , Arum hopes to get some extra money buy charging the Chinese audience $5 per PPV . Out there it wont matter who Pacquiao fights , and he will still get some money from the US fans who still love to watch Pacquiao regardless of who the opponent is . That 's a good thing , because Pacquiao does n't have many options in Top Rank for his November fight . <p> When the name Chris Algieri is mentioned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem with opponents . Nothing against what Algieri did by beating Provodnikov , but his name is hardly a name worth mentioning next to Pacquiaos yet . For Pacquiao , a rematch with Juan Manuel Marquez seems to be the only option . Marquez wants big time money though , and it does n't  look like Arum would be able to afford it going off Pacquiaos previous fights . Even with the Mexican and Chinese audience added , Marquez has been edging along the $20 million mark for his Pacquiao rematch payday . That 's a lot considering Pacquiao is likely to earn around $30 million . <p> Other opponents that had been mentioned sound unreasonable right now . Rios already fought him , Alvarado just lost , Provodnikov just lost , Jessie Vargas is fighting in August , and Mikey Garcia is on ice with a lawsuit against Top Rank . Just like Mayweather though , Pacquiao does have something good working for him . Now that Golden Boy and Top Rank plan to work together Pacquiao can add some opponents in the mix . Fighters like Marcos Maidana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned as possible foes . They may not make the cut for this November while Golden Boy sorts out which fighters are actually there 's but the Spring of 2015 looks promising once Golden Boy figures out who is in their stable . <p> The final thought here is that neither Mayweather or Pacquiao look to have a super selling fight lined up for this fall . Its likely we get Mayweather-Maidana II with an outside chance of Mayweather-Khan in September . Its also likely Arum figures out a way to get Pacquiao-Marquez V. If not , whoever he finds to face Pacqauio will not be someone that deserves to be in there with him unless buy some shocking last minutes surprise he gets a Golden Boy fighter . Unfortunately , despite it being the perfect time for a Maweather-Pacquiao showdown , its not going to happen .

Kubo jumped out to a strong start but his youthful presence slowly gave way to Cermeno 's experience . The Japanese southpaw enjoyed a significant edge in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps durability . Cermeno picked up on this in swinging momentum in his favor in round four , though it required his all but giving away the first three rounds to get to that point . He also suffered a cut on his cheek but disregarded the blood as he was beginning to dial in with his right hand . <p> Kubo was persistent in his body attack , undoubtedly what led to Cermeno 's ultimate downfall . However , it left him open for a little chin music as Cermeno rallied late in round seven to put his younger foe on the canvas for the bout 's lone knockdown . Kubo beat the count but was forced to ride out an unmerciful rally from the veteran boxer in the final 30 seconds of the right . <p> It could have very well served as the final great moments of an overachieving career . <p> Kubo struggled out the gate at the start of the 8th round but by the midway point had permanently seized control of the action . Cermeno was still in pursuit of a knockout finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly began to take its toll on the wily veteran . <p> One last surge came in round ten , as Kubo was able to disguise the pain endured from an uppercut and follow-up right hand from Cermeno . Showing his own ring intelligence , the southpaw clinched himself out of harm 's way long enough to clear his head and finish the round on a high note . <p> The late sequence was enough to ultimately beat the fight out of Cermeno , who stunningly opted to remain on his stool as the bell sounded to signal what was to be the start of the championship rounds . <p> Instead , it was a changing of the guard as Kubo was declared a technical knockout winner at 0:05 of round eleven . <p> Perhaps the most heartbreaking development was that one last surge by Cermeno could have allowed him to retain his title . He was ahead 95-94 on one scorecard while trailing by the same tally in the eyes of the other two judges . <p> Instead , it 's by far the biggest win of Kubo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up an interim title in the sequence . With the trinket comes the prize of being granted the winner of the oft-rescheduled title consolidation clash between Guillermo Rigondeaux and Moises Flores , which is now set for June 17 in Las Vegas . <p> For Cermeno , it 's the agony of defeat and the realization that he 's an old man in a young man 's game . He heads home with his first loss in five years - almost to the day - in falling to 26-6-1 ( 15KOs ) . He managed to scratch out a heck of a ring career , one that includes back-to-back points wins over Cristian Mijares in earning his first interim title and an upset victory over then-unbeaten Oscar Escandon in 2013 . Even in defeat he proved his worth twice versus the excellent -and then-bantamweight champ - Anselmo Moreno and in a razor thin points loss to Victor Terrazas in a title eliminator.

The manner in which he was able to pull off the upset and win the crowd was an even greater uphill climb , rising from two 1st round knockdowns to claim a split decision in their 12-round thriller Friday evening at Huntington Center in Toledo , Ohio . <p> For the first three minutes of the bout - which aired live in the second leg of a PBC on Bounce tripleheader - Warren looked to be the most complete boxer in the world . The diminutive southpaw showed blazing hand speed , brilliant defense and stepped up his game in terms of his underrated punching power . The latter produced early drama - and a world of pain for Zhakiyanov who found himself on the canvas midway through round one and again mere moments later . <p> In moments of adversity . a boxer can only remain as calm and composed as those around him . Manning his corner , promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind Zhakiyanov of what Warren was able to do and how to properly adjust . <p> " We know Rau'Shee was the quicker fighter , the better boxer and was going to win a fight as long as Zhanat would only try to match him punch for punch , " an elated Hatton - whose promotional company now has its first world champion - told FightNights.com after the bout . " I told him to get in there , mug him , get in his chest and bang away at his body before coming back upstairs . <p> It took for Zhakiyanov to fall behind 20-17 on all three cards before making said adjustments , but completely turned around the fight once he implemented the sage advice . Warren 's hand speed was no longer a factor , in part because he stopped jabbing but also due to Zhakiyanov successfully cutting off the ring and shortening the distance on his punches . <p> From there came a fan-friendly slugfest that proved difficult for the judges to score . The three ringside officials were split on five of the final nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores . <p> While the fight itself was memorable , the officiating for the bout was a different story . Referee Gary Rosato missed what should have been two knockdown calls for Zhakiyanov , insisting on both occasions that a push caused Warren to fall to the canvas . The third man also had a strange habit of shoving the diminutive boxers away from one another in lieu of merely separating the two on any called break in the action . <p> Once the fight crossed the finish line , the three judges assigned seemed uncertain in what just took place . Larry Hazzard somehow had Warren winning 115-111 despite the perception that the lone three-time U.S. Olympic boxer in history had lost the majority of the rounds past the opening two . <p> On the extreme opposite side of the equation , judges John Stewart and Brian Kennedy scored it 115-111 and 116-110 , respectively , in favor of Zhakiyanov , who swept rounds 3-12 on the latter scorecard . <p> " I knew I won the fight but was n't sure about getting the decision since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an interpreter after the fight . " So we were surprised but in a good way when the judges saw what we felt took place . " <p> As noted by Hatton , it was the type of fight where the losing combatant would believe he was wronged . Such was exactly the mindset carried by a heartbroken Warren afterward . <p> " Man , I won that fight , " Warren insisted after the bout . " I knocked him down , I was landing the cleaner punches and making him miss . What it is , the judges are favoring aggressive fighters , even when they ai n't even landing . <p> It was a similar feeling when he dropped a hotly contested split decision to then-unbeaten titlist Juan Carlos Payano in Aug.

Judging always plays a key role in these type of fights as well . Will the judges favor aggression or boxing ? Especially in a close round . Another situation with this particular fight is the weight . Who has the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> To better breakdown the fight I 'll set this up into three categories : Weight , Judging , and Fight Breakdown : <p> WEIGHT : <p> Shawn Porter said that this will be the first time he has fought at 144 since the early days of his amateur career . He always claims that he made the weight easily . By the look of his body and face at the weigh-in last night I believe him . Broner looked a little off though . The catch-weight and rehydration clause was put in place to give Broner an advantage against a much bigger guy . It would appear as though Broner messed that up . Word is they scratched Porter 's next day rehydration limit of 154 because Broner himself was going to come in higher than that . With a fully rehydrated Shawn Porter the advantage that Broner had going into Saturday night is now gone . <p> JUDGING : <p> This will play a key part . Some judges favor clean effective punching over aggression while others vice versa . I can see some rounds where Broner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good ones of his own . These split rounds are going to be on the hands of the judges . Do n't be surprised if we get some crazy scorecards tonight with everyone all over the place . If Broner ca n't keep Porter off of him then those close rounds will be interesting to judge . Porter loves to come forward , and even if he is n't landing clean , some judges may favor that if Broner is n't doing a good enough job of keeping him off . We could be looking at a split decision . I could also see one person scoring 116-112 for Broner while another 116-112 Porter . It could be that type of fight . <p> FIGHT BREAKDOWN : <p> For Adrien Broner to get the nod tonight he 's going to have to box Porter 's ears off . Floyd Mayweather has been teaching him , and that 's how he is going to have to fight to win . He has to control the pace of the fight with distance and the jab . He can never be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key . Timing will be essential . He has to time Porter jumping in at him , get a fast combination off , and move out . Staying in front of Porter for to long or not moving his legs will get him in trouble . He also has to stay off the ropes . Broner has the better for work so my advice for him would be to use it . If he needs down time , stick that jab and move . He ca n't let Porter think about what he is going to do . He has to fluster him with his movement . <p> For Shawn Porter , everything I said above he has to not let Broner do . He is going to have to smother him . Porter needs to cut the ring off on Broner , trap him in the corner and against the ropes , and unleash when he does . I also think that Porter should invest in the body early . Broner likes to stand in the middle of the ring sometimes with his chin tucked kind of like Mayweather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he gets caught sometimes . Broner also likes to exchange toe to toe so Porter has to draw him into that type of fight . He should take a page from Marcos Maidana 's book . Do n't let off the gas . His him everywhere and anywhere as often as he can . The over hand right will be key for him . Broner does n't do a very job at blocking that punch . He might be able to drop him with it . <p> PREDICTION : <p> The biggest question for me is if Adrien Broner does n't have the power to keep Porter off of him then will he be able to box the entire twelve rounds with Porter pushing the fight ? In the John Molina fight Broner boxed liked Mayweather . It was boring but he won . I think he plans to do the same tonight . However Shawn Porter is not John Molina . I 'm not sure Broner has the power or ability to keep Porter off of him all night . He was n't able to keep Paulie Malignaggi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good Mayweather like style and pulls off the decision while another part of me thinks that Porter is going to walk through him and beat him like Maidana did . It 's a toss up , so I flipped a coin and I 'm going with Porter .

Title , Moves Up In Weight <p> It was always a matter of time before Jermall Charlo abandoned the 154-pound division in favor of a middleweight run . <p> That time has now arrived . <p> On the heels of confirmation that Tony Harrison and Jarrett Hurd would be vying for the super welterweight previously held by Charlo came the official word of the unbeaten Houston product abandoning his crown and the division altogether . The 6 ' 0 " boxer - whose twin brother Jermell remains a beltholder at 154-pounds and defends versus Charles Hatley on March 11 - put off the inevitable long enough , but will now embark on a middleweight campaign in pursuit of a second world title . <p> " I 've been thinking about moving to 160 pounds for a while now , ' ' Charlo ( 25-0 , 19KOs ) said in a statement released through the press office of Premier Boxing Champions ( PBC ) . " It was a struggle for me to make the weight for the last title fight . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure how long I could hold the weight . " <p> Charlo held the belt long enough to lodge three successful title defenses following a knockout win over Cornelius Bundrage in their Sept. ' 15 NBC-televised title fight . His first defense also aired live on a Saturday matinee edition of PBC on NBC , forcing Wilky Campfort to quit via injury inside of four rounds . <p> The two-win 2016 campaign did n't boast the rate of activity that Charlo would have preferred , but his quality of victories still managed to land an honorable mention in the Fighter of the Year race . The 26-year old edged out former 154 lb. titlist Austin Trout last May , then returned in a savage way with a highlight reel 5th round knockout of previously unbeaten Julian ' J-Rock ' Williams last December . <p> Whereas most titlists will attempt to stick around at least for a unification bout , such was not a realistic option for Charlo . Two of the division 's titleholders are his twin brother Jermell and Cuban southpaw Erislandy Lara , the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shields . The only other option would have been Saul ' Canelo ' Alvarez , whom - in addition to his being tied up with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr . in their catchweight money grab later this May - is promoted by Golden Boy Promotions , which presently is n't in the business of handing over its clients to top Haymon boxers given the checkered past between the two sides . <p> With that came the belief that he 'd maxed out his earning potential at this weight . <p> " I held it an extra year to fight Austin Trout and Julian Williams . " Charlo insists . " I feel there are bigger and better things for me at 160 where I can still hold my weight and be stronger . The idea of being a two-time world champion is a big goal for me . <p> " If there were a big fight at 154 pounds left for me , I 'd stick around and wait for it .

That aspect clearly was n't lost on either veteran contender , as both hit the scales in supreme condition for Saturday 's main event at Echo Arena in Liverpool , England . Murray checked in at 159.2 lbs. , the lightest he has weighed for a prizefight since a June ' 14 win over Max Bursak back when he was a full-time middleweight . Rosado registered at a ripped 159.3 lbs . for his first career fight in the United Kingdom . <p> The bout will air live on Sky Sports in the United Kingdom . <p> Murray ( 34-4-1 , 16KOs ) has come up short in four career title fights , including three at middleweight .

The now 34-year old Brit also dropped a very competitive decision to Arthur Abraham in a failed bid for the super middleweight title in Nov. ' 15 . <p> Among his most convincing defeats , however , were two bouts that altered his career . Murray was viewed as valiant in defeat in his 11th round stoppage at the hands of unbeaten middleweight champ Gennady Golovkin in Feb. ' 15 , after which he and his team decided it was best to compete in the super middleweight division . He has fought at or above that divisional limit in each of his past seven starts , including a 12-round points win over Nuhu Lawal last November . <p> However , that victory was preceded by the revelation that he can no longer compete with the best super middleweights as evidenced in his decisive points loss to countryman George Groves last June . It was n't fully decided at the time in which direction he would take his career , but dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosado is a clear indication that he can still fight at middleweight . <p> Saturday night represents a far greater must-win scenario for Rosado ( 23-10-0-1ND , 13KOs ) , who is in great need of a career turnaround with just two wins in his past seven starts . The 31-year old Philadelphia native - who has spent the past several years in California while capitalizing on acting and modeling opportunities , including a supporting role in the smash hit 2015 boxing film " Creed " - has shown no fear in his 11-year career , but the unfortunate reality is that he has fallen well short in his most significant fights . <p> Still , he 's managed two shots at the middleweight title , though both ending in stoppage losses . His bravery far exceeded his ability to compete in a 7th round stoppage loss to Golovkin in their Jan. ' 13 title fight . Still , he bounced back strong in what should have been a clear-cut win over J'Leon Love less than four months later . The judges did their best to steal it from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening was changed to a No-Decision after Love tested positive for a banned substance . <p> His 2013 campaign ended with a second title shot - and with zero wins on the year when all was said and done as he was stopped in 10 rounds by Peter Quillin . Two more losses were tacked onto his ledger before making significant changes in his career which led to a points win over Joshua Clottey in Dec. ' 15 . He added another victory before falling miserably short versus Willie Monroe Jr . last September . The defeat prompted questions of whether he would consider resuming his career , which only adds to his desire to come out victorious on Saturday as he enters hostile territory in fighting outside of the U.S. for the first time .

It is competition in its purest form two athletes using their God given abilities to out-dual the other in combat . No team . No equipment besides gloves . No objects . Yet the strategy involved in a prize fight takes the purest form of competition and turns it into a rare piece of theater <p> This past weekend , the Mandalay Bay Events Center played host to BKBs first pay-per-view fight card in the United States . The main event featured battle tested veterans Gabriel Rosado and Brian Vera . On the surface , this matchup equates to a pretty good scrap in traditional boxing but when offered with the added elements of BKB boxing , its much more enticing . <p> BKB features a pit instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bouts are seven rounds and only two minutes long . What BKB offers can only be truly appreciated by the eye . After watching Rosado KO Brian Vera with a crushing counter right hand in the sixth round , I walked away wondering if this was the future of the sport . <p> The action was heavy , as there 's really nowhere to hide in the claustrophobic pit . It reminded me of a video game , where both fighters are in one spot slipping and trading punches with the slightest of lateral movement . BKB was intense and I have to admit I like it . <p> But let 's not get carried away fight fans it will never replace traditional boxing . I see it more as an added element to the fight game An entity that can take C+ fighters like Gabe Rosado and Brian Vera and put on a good show . Its a tremendous avenue for one-dimensional fighters who may have lost their way in the traditional game . <p> See we as people tend to overreact at the newest and brightest objects of entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying when in actuality it couldnt be further from the truth . Is it where it once was ? Definitely not . But there 's two aspects of traditional boxing that will continue to carry the sport its history and its diversity . BKB offers neither . <p> Everyone loves a war two guys slugging it out until one succumbs to defeat . Its a part of sports that 's unparalleled . But remember , too much of one thing is never a good thing . Its human nature . We need balance . Traditional boxing offers balance . For every Castillo-Corrales I there 's a De La Hoya-Mosley I. Two completely different types of fights , but equally entertaining . There 's a beauty in being able to use the ring to your advantage . The best fights have a blend of it all great boxing , movement and exchanges . BKB wont be able to offer that . <p> The biggest proponent of BKB is its name Big Knockouts . The idea is that people want to see more knockouts . People need to once again see the deeper picture its never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the knocking out . There 's a physiological aspect that the majority of sports fans fail to realize . We do n't  wan na just see knockouts , we wan na see the best fighters in the world score knockouts . Traditional boxing makes us appreciate the knockout ! When Manny Pacquiao got put to sleep by that violent right hand counter from Juan Manuel Marquez , the sporting world was shocked ! In awe of such a moment ! Its balance and its needed . <p> Its also why I feel BKB is the perfect added element to traditional boxing . Not an evolution of the sport , but more of a component to garner new fans to the sweet science . Its also a perfectly constructed bridging of the gap for MMA fans with a slight curiosity in boxing . I 'm all for it ! <p> I really hope Big Knockout Boxing is successful and branches out to other cable providers and networks for the simple fact that in its infancy , BKB has no choice but to offer exciting drama-filled matchups .

The move comes after the surprise revelation of his parting ways with veteran coach Joe Gallagher . <p> " After six years of working together , I announce my departure from Joe Gallagher , " Quigg said in a statement released through the press office of Matchroom Boxing . " We have been a great team ... have achieved a lot and had some great wins together . " <p> Quigg ( 31-1-2 , 24KOs ) flourished under Gallagher 's guidance , quickly transitioning from a rising prospect to one of the best super bantamweights in the world .

The event was a commercial success , but unfortunately a largely dull affair in the ring as Quigg suffered a broken jaw and his rally coming too late to avoid a split decision defeat for the lone loss of his career to date . <p> Frampton parlayed the victory with a featherweight-title lifting effort over Leo Santa Cruz last July to earn honors as 2016 Fighter of the Year .

" <p> In a strange twist of fate , Quigg 's vision of capturing a featherweight crown could very well come against Frampton 's lone conqueror . Santa Cruz reclaimed the featherweight crown with a hard fought win in their rematch this past January in Las Vegas . <p> Avenging the lone loss of his career would be ubdoubtedly sweet .

Golovkin has over a 90% KO ratio while Lemieux has over an 85% KO ratio , pretty much setting the tone that his fight is highly unlikely to go the distance . <p> Every fight is set up to be exciting with each one presenting a good chance of a KO . Now it 's time to breakdown and predict Golovkin-Lemieux , and give my predictions for the rest of the card . <p> What David Lemieux has to do : <p> Golovkin is better than Lemieux in most areas . He 's stronger , has better defense , and has a better ring IQ than most give him credit for . The problem that Golovkin has is that if you can not hurt him he will put his guard down and let you hit him while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemieux 's favor if he 's smart about it . I 'd lay off the power at first . If he could get Golovkin comfortable enough to where he 's coming in recklessly for the kill then maybe he can land some big shots to hurt Golovkin . I very rarely see Lemieux back up in a fight but in this one I think he has too . Golovkin will push the fight forward so if Lemieux can try to counter him with big shots he may catch him . Lemieux is also faster but sometimes he barrages in throwing wide punches . He 's going to have to be contained a little if he has any chance at winning this fight and pick his power punches . If he just rushes forward throwing bombs it 's likely he 'll get countered to much and eventually KO'ed . Lemieux has to be smart because Golovkin does have flaws in his defense . There are times to explode and times not too . Lemieux is going to have to figure it out . On the opposite side of this , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to get going , Lemieux may just want to come out swinging for the fences in the hopes of landing a KO punch . Of course , this strategy would involve a very good chance at him getting knocked out as well . <p> What Gennady Golovkin has to do : <p> Gennady just has to fight like he fights . Lemieux is the hardest puncher he has ever faced and is one of the hardest punchers in boxing . Other than Golovkin himself there is no harder puncher from the 154-168 division than Lemieux . Golovkin has to be careful not to get to comfortable in pushing the fight . I can see Lemieux landing some big shots early in this fight . The key for Golovkin is to make sure he sees them coming . It 's the punches that he wo n't see that could allow Lemieux to drop him . Golovkin needs to establish the jab and make Lemieux feel his power early . This will make Lemieux hesitant . Golovkin 's hook will be a key punch along with his cross . Lemieux likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big chance to counter and land the KO punch . If he can get Lemieux to back up then he needs to get him on the ropes and throw combinations like he usually does . Golovkin sometimes starts slow and that 's because he likes to size up and analyze his opponent . The most dangerous rounds for Golovkin will be the first two while he 's getting his range and tactics down . Lemieux 's does n't have much more than one gear so once Golovkin figures him out Lemieux could be in trouble . One thing that Golovkin loves to do is invest in the body . If he can get those in early then Lemieux wo n't last long . <p> Prediction : <p> Everyone is picking Golovkin by KO and I do n't see my pick being any different . Usually when people expect big knockouts in big fights somehow the fight ends up making it to the cards . I do n't see that being the case here . Someone is getting knocked out . It could be in the first round or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight .

Lately , however , he has also seen his name attached to false rumors of his having turned down said assignment due to issues with the purse offer attached to said opportunity . <p> " I want to put this out there , I have not in any way turned down the fight or any offer that has been made to me , " Diaz ( 19-1 , 9KOs ) told FightNights.com .

There were initial talks of his returning to his Omaha , Nebraska hometown , but that has been ruled out . Should Diaz land the assignment on that date and in that location , he will be the one with a hometown advantage of sorts , with the site - one of several in the mix , with nothing at all confirmed - barely an hour from his Bronx residence . <p> Diaz has sought a big fight ever since posting the most impressive win of his career , a 10-round decision over previously unbeaten Sammy Vasquez in a move up to welterweight last July in Birmingham , Alabama . The bout aired nationwide in primetime on Fox TV , but viewers saw him once again have to deal with officiating issues on a free-to-air network before having his hand raised . <p> Nine months after landing on the wrong end of a controversial split decision loss to Lamont Peterson in Oct.

A scoring error eventually righted the ship , with the now-33-year old earning a unanimous decision . <p> From there came the decision to ink a promotional pact with Lou DiBella , adding to a team that included adviser Al Haymon and manager Jose Nunez . In search of a big opportunity , Diaz immediately volunteered his services once word came out of Crawford being granted a surprise HBO date last December 10 . <p> Aside from a text to his manager from a high-ranking Top Rank team asking if he could get back down to 140-pounds , Diaz was never even given the chance to field an offer . <p> " I basically signed a blank check to fight this guy last year , " Diaz said , wanting the fight regardless of the payday that came with it .

The Californian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-sided knockout loss in Crawford 's hometown of Omaha , Nebraska . <p> The payday that came with that fight became a point of contention with those negotiating on Diaz ' behalf for a potential Crawford fight this spring . The offer was less - but with good reason . <p> Crawford was given the date after the originally intended occupant , Saul ' Canelo ' Alvarez withdrew due to injury . As HBO had set aside a significant portion of its remaining 2016 budget for separate HBO appearances by Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin , money was freed up when neither wound up fighting on the pay-cable network last December . <p> As is the case with television budgets , all allocated funds must be used up by the end of the fiscal year as they can not be carried over .

" He would like to get $375,000 for the fight - $50,000 more which is very fair . But I - through my manager Jose Nunez - made it clear in no uncertain terms that my team has orders to make the Crawford fight happen . " <p> The issue was never that Top Rank made a lowball offer as initially believed by Diaz ' team or that HBO is being stingy with the budget . Rather , the holdup is Diaz ' handlers displeasure in how such a payday would be divided up as everyone is expecting a slice - too many cooks ruining a good meal , should this one not make it to the table . <p> Sadly , that seems to be the latest reality , as Top Rank is strongly considering a move to open up talks with Adrian Granados . The timing is perfect , as the Chicago-bred slugger was valiant in defeat in a narrow points loss to Adrien Broner just one week ago in Cincinnati . The takeaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defeat than Broner - a former four-division champ who forced a late weight-change to welterweight for this fight - looked in victory . <p> From a business perspective , it 's understandable why Top Rank would want to travel down such a path .

' 14 points win over the career-long gatekeeper . " All due respect to Granados , he fought his heart out , and yeah of course he wants the paydays . But I beat him , I have Olympic pedigree and I 'm the best option that Terence Crawford has right now . <p> He just needs for everyone on his team to understand the importance of not allowing talks to break down . <p> " I ca n't repeat this enough ; I want this fight , " Diaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us .

Facing a guy that he will be a huge favorite against that no one really wants to see ?

Boxing has never had a great amount of viewers in the summer months . June , July , and August are usually slow for all sports in the United States .

@@37620522 @6620522/ <h> Zolani Tete Upgraded To Full WBO Bantamweight Titlist <p> The 29-year old southpaw has spent the past two years gunning for a bantamweight title in the wake of his super flyweight title reign ending with his being stripped over a dispute in the purse offering for a mandatory title defense . In a strange twist , his new title reign comes about due to the previous claimant also being forced to relinquish his crown outside the ring . <p> Tete 's 12-round whitewash of Arthur Villanueva earlier this month was originally slated as a final title eliminator , with the winner to get next line versus whomever emerged victorious in the title fight scheduled one day later in Japan between defending champ Marlon Tapales and local challenger Shohei Omori . <p> Tapales was removed from that equation after missing weight by nearly two pounds , thus forced to concede his title at the scales . The development prompted the World Boxing Organization to upgrade Tete-Villanueva from a final eliminator to an interim title fight . <p> Tete cruised to victory in Leicester , England , after which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out between Tapales and Omori , the latter whom was still eligible to win the vacant title since made weight .

' 15 - was decked hard late in round ten . He beat the count , but was still worse for the wear as Tapales finished him off 0:16 into round eleven . <p> The outcome meant the WBO was faced with a decision - have interim champ Tete enter a vacant title fight versus the next highest-rated available contender , or advance him to full bantamweight titlist . <p> A phone call placed on Wednesday gave Tete the news he dreamed of hearing . <p> I think I am dreaming . Please do not wake me up because this is an incredible dream , " Tete ( 25-3 , 20KOs ) said of being named full titlist . " I left the United Kingdom as an interim champion .

Now I have the WBO belt I want to clean up the rest of the division , " Tete insists . " I want to be remembered as one of the greatest African boxers of all time . "

It 's a choice that never comes easy for a boxer . To abandon the sport they love , the job that they have had for years , the only job they know . Retirement is always a good thought . Sometimes , though , especially in boxing , it'a thought that tricks you into thinking that it 's better than it actually is . Fighter 's get the urge to fight again after being away from the sport for so long . If they retire when they are not ready they find themselves urging to come back . Just ask Oscar De La Hoya . <p> Froch 's decision this week has the attention of not just his fans though , but of that of the world of boxing . That decision has many fans interested for one enormous reason ... Gennady Golovkin . Fans have been yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple G in a huge fight , a fight that will test him , a fight that will see him less than a 7-1 favorite . Carl Froch is the only person available that poses that threat right now . As Froch nears the end of this career he has given himself three options . Retire , fight James DeGale , or fight Gennady Golovkin . In any situation he 's earned the right to whatever choice he pleases . He 's earned the right to retire . He 's earned the right to face James DeGale at home in front of a massive crowd to quiet his bad mouthing of Froch . Carl Froch has never been one to back down from a fight . He 's fought the best of the best , at their best , in a very very good era of middle and super middleweights .

However , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false statement . The fans want Froch-Golovkin . Any other decision that comes from Froch that does n't involve facing Golovkin is going to be a huge disappointment . Somewhere in the back of his mind Froch has to know that . If you know anything about Carl Froch you know that he loves himself , and he loves to challenge himself . He also hates to disappoint . When Froch said that he would be willing to face Golovkin two weeks ago he had to expect the pressure from the public . He 's getting it . Perhaps more so is the pressure coming from himself . Froch wants to be the guy to beat Golovkin . For him to have all of the bragging rights in the world about beating the world 's most avoided fighter before retirement would send Froch away on the highest horse there is . He would embellish it for the rest of his life . <p> The decision to retire is always tough . The decision to face the world 's most dangerous fighter at the end of your career is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but there is also an itch to leave the sport for good . Safety and health come in to play as well . One thing Froch must ask himself , is he ready to leave the sport of boxing ? Is never fighting again a thought that he relishes in , or in the back of his mind is he thinking he has a few fights left in him ? The pressure from the boxing community is on to face Gennady Golovkin . Froch would be the underdog , something that he likes . He also needs the motivation . When thinking of continuing your career you have to ask the question , who do I want to really beat that will make me train ? Golovkin provides that as well . At the end of the day the decision lies on Froch . This week is the week he will decide . It wo n't be an easy one , and anything other than Golovkin would likely be a disappointment .
