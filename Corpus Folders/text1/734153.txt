@@121217838 @10217838/ <h> Frequently asked questions <h> What are the types of diabetes ? <p> Gestational diabetes- is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually goes away after the birth of the baby . <p> Pre-diabetes is a condition that occurs when the blood glucose level is higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes . If left untreated , people with pre-diabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes . <h> What is pre-diabetes ? <p> Pre-diabetes is the stage leading to type 2 diabetes , when blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes . For many people it means the diabetes clock has started ticking . Type 2 diabetes is characterised by the body not producing enough insulin or not using it properly . Insulin is needed to help move glucose from the bloodstream into the cells for energy . During the pre-diabetes stage , cells are becoming resistant to insulin with the result that blood glucose levels begin to rise . <h> How do you know you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because at this stage there are no symptoms or warning signs . But you can work out your own risk of pre-diabetes by answering some simple questions . If you are overweight or obese , over 55 , have a family history of diabetes or lead a sedentary , physically inactive lifestyle , you are a candidate for type 2 diabetes and should discuss it with your GP . <h> What are the risks to your health ? <p> Any rise in blood glucose levels must be taken seriously because it may indicate pre-diabetes . Pre-diabetes is itself a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes as well as increasing your risk of heart disease . Left unmanaged , it may well develop into diabetes within 5 to 10 years . The life threatening complications of diabetes are heart attacks , kidney failure , blindness , amputation and stroke . <h> Can you prevent diabetes ? <p> If you are talking about type 2 diabetes , the good news is yes , you can prevent or delay progressing from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes . This can be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , Finland and China have shown that aiming for a modest weight loss of up to 7% and increasing physical activity to at least 30 minutes most days of the week can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . The studies showed that people at risk of type 2 diabetes were able to reduce their risk by nearly 60% . Most people who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese so weight loss is an important first step . In the case of type 1 diabetes , which is an autoimmune disease , there is currently no method of prevention . <h> Who are most at risk of pre-diabetes ? <p> People who are overweight , have a family history of diabetes , are over the age of 55 , do little or no physical activity and women who had gestational diabetes in pregnancy or have polycystic ovarian syndrome are at risk and should speak to their doctor about these risk factors at their next visit . Other high-risk people are Aboriginal , Torres Strait Islanders , Chinese , Pacific Islanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to diabetes . 80% to 90% of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese . Six out of ten Australians are considered significantly overweight and the increasing prevalence of obesity in children has become a major health concern . That 's why early intervention is critical . It 's equally important for those people who already have diabetes to be put on a management program early to prevent complications . <h> Will everyone with pre-diabetes go on to develop Type 2 diabetes ? <p> It 's estimated that more than 16% or about two million Australians have pre-diabetes and research shows that a third or more of people with the condition will go on to develop the disease . The rate of development of diabetes from pre diabetes is about 5 to 10 % annually . <h> What do you do if you have pre-diabetes ? <p> A diagnosis of pre-diabetes gives you a chance to prevent a life-threatening illness . You can do something about it with changes to your lifestyle . Losing excess weight through a healthy diet and exercise can improve the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently . Most adult Australians are overweight and most do n't engage in regular physical activity , yet research shows that moderate weight loss and an exercise program of 30 minutes five times a week can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by nearly 60% . Exercise helps reduce blood glucose levels directly . A healthy diet means making healthier food choices . Eat fewer foods containing saturated fats such as butter and fatty meats and have more fruit , vegetables and fibre on a daily basis . Because it takes a serious commitment to a lifestyle change , you need to make adjustments in your daily routine that are sustainable , so speak to you doctor . <h> If I have pre-diabetes , should I check my BGL regularly ? <p> Your doctor will arrange for the frequency of BGL testing . In general , a person with pre-diabetes does not need to check his or her BGLs at home , as do many people who have diabetes .

Be Well -Know Your BGL ' puts awareness of blood glucose in the same context as cholesterol and blood pressure . Just as cholesterol levels and blood pressure levels are a measure of health , so is our Blood Glucose Level . <h> Why is it important to know your BGL ? <p> BGL is an important indicator of your health in the same way as cholesterol or blood pressure . Knowing your BGL helps you control your health and , if it 's too high , you can do something about it .

Why did n't someone tell me about it ? <p> You need to know as soon as possible that your blood glucose levels are starting to rise " because this is the time you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes . Even if you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , it is vital to start an effective management program as soon as possible to prevent chronic complications . <h> Why do you use the phrase Blood Glucose Level rather than blood sugar level ? <p> Using the phrase Blood Glucose Level gives us the chance to put the record straight .

There are two major types of diabetes : <p> Type 1 is an autoimmune disease in which the body does not produce any insulin . It is most often diagnosed in children . People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin injections every day to stay alive . Type 1 accounts for 10%-15% of diabetes . <p> Type 2 is a metabolic disorder resulting from the body 's inability to make enough insulin or properly use it . Type 2 accounts for 85%-90% of people with diabetes and is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity , lack of physical activity and poor eating habits . Genetic factors also largely contribute to type 2 diabetes . Unfortunately , for the first time in Australia , children are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia ? <p> Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic disease in Australia . More than 1.1 million people already have diabetes . The concern is that half of them do n't know they have it " yet . Every week 1,200 people are diagnosed with diabetes . That 's an average of 60,000 a year . Diabetes NSW expects the number of Australians with diabetes to climb to 1.8 million over the next eight years . It 's a gathering storm threatening to overtake all of us . That 's why we want to encourage people to be alert to pre-diabetes and know their BGL . <h> Is diabetes that serious ? <p> It 's a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as heart attack and stroke , as well as kidney failure , blindness and amputations .

Those at greatest risk of severe hypoglycaemia are pre-school and school age children , those with frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia and people who have lost the ability to recognise a hypo ( hypoglycaemia unawareness ) . <p> Glucagon will need to be administered by someone other than the person with diabetes , so family members and/or friends need to be trained in its use . Glucagon is dispensed as a dry powder in an ampoule together with a pre-filled liquid containing syringe . This needs to be mixed together before giving into the outer , upper arm , the front , middle of the thigh or the buttock . If people are unsure of when and how to administer it , they should see a diabetes educator . <p> Glucagon should be stored in a cool place and has an expiry date . It is important that a rapidly absorbed carbohydrate be given after recovery from a hypo and the usual hypoglycaemia protocol followed to prevent its recurrence.

In fact it is an essential part of all the cells around your body , making up about half of the cell wall and helping the cell communicate with the other cells around it . Cholesterol is carried around the body by two different types of transporters called lipoproteins ' . The LDL ( Low Density Lipoprotein ) cholesterol is the lousy ' type .

Hyperglycaemia , or high blood glucose levels , can affect people with all types of diabetes , making you feel more tired , headachy , irritable or thirsty . <p> Many different factors can make your blood glucose levels higher than normal . Figuring out the underlying cause is the first step to knowing how to bring them back down . We 've picked out the top reasons why your blood glucose levels might be high : <p> Carbohydrates like bread , potato , fruit and milk products are all broken down into glucose and directly raise blood glucose levels . Having a bigger meal or more carbohydrate than usual can push glucose levels up . <p> Physical activity is great for using up glucose from the blood . Being less active than usual can mean the glucose is stuck in the blood , making glucose higher than normal . Intense exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon use it up for energy . <p> Medications for diabetes , including tablets and insulin , are all designed to lower glucose levels , so missing a dose or taking less than usual will usually result in higher blood glucose levels . Some other medications , such as steroids , make the body more insulin resistant and so raise glucose levels . <p> Stress tells the body to be on high alert and get ready for action . The body responds by making the heart beat faster , the breathing rate speed up and dumping extra glucose in the blood for energy . <p> Illness or infection causes the body to produce extra hormones to help heal the body . However these hormones temporarily prevent insulin from working effectively and can make blood glucose levels higher than usual . <p> Diabetes is progressive meaning that cells in the pancreas wear out over time and are not able to make as much insulin . This may lead to higher blood glucose levels and signal the need for changes to your diabetes management plan . <p> Having a one-off , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of diabetes complications. - In people with type 2 diabetes , their body is still able to make some insulin , so the glucose level usually comes back down within a few days once the underlying issue has been resolved . <p> In the meantime , aim to get plenty of rest , drink plenty of fluids and do some light exercise such as a walk around the block , if you 're feeling well enough . If you 're sick or treating an infection , talk to your GP or pharmacist about options to treat the problem and alleviate symptoms . If you 're feeling stressed , depressed or anxious , take some time out for yourself to do something you enjoy " maybe a massage or catch up with a friend .
