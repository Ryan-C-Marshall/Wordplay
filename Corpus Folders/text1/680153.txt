Based on our thorough understanding of taste mechanisms , we have developed a product which we believe will increase the pleasure of your vaping experience . MTS vape wizard contributes toward softening any acidic/sour perception , it assists in making vapour thicker , and it delivers both body and depth to any e-liquid . It can be used on its own , blended with tobacco flavours , or with any other flavour of your choice . There are no limitations as to its versatility . Make your vapour fuller and richer .. Let MTS Vape Wizard work its magic for you ! Suggested dosage 0,5-2% Additional notes on Vape Wizard . we developed it starting from a food flavor that delivers aged , woody and slightly smoky notes . The original flavor was formulated to improve mouthfeel and body , especially for liquid foods and some type of drinks . As it worked well in foodstuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we combined it with Magic Mask ( see its features ) , which works on tongue receptor and soften the acid perception . So when we tasted and tested VW , we noticed that theory was right and it delivered its promises . It does not influence the vapour properties , nor boost the steam in any way . It works as a food flavor and the substances we used , when used at subtle level , delivers the full and bodied sensation . It is a very delicate flavor , and its action is on perception inside the mouth . It should be used in combination with other flavor from 0.2 up to 1% max . It tends to lower high notes and boost the background notes . It is a complimentary flavor and should not vaped as such , due to the fact it has an undistinct taste . Its main goal is to round off other flavors. " -Flavour Art Italy 
@@119998847 @8998847/ 214805 @qwx1074805 <p> This flavor was 6 months in development , and is a fairly close approximation of the flavor of cannabis.We want to stress that it is an artificial blend that contains no active ingredients , just flavor . We have had feedback about ways to experiment with this one , try adding a little vanilla , and if you 're looking for that " skunk cabbage " note , try addinga little of the Kona Coffee <p> I mixed this with blueberry and pomegranate . The end process tasted like laundry detergent smells . I will not buy this flavor again . It has no connection with the flavor of any Mary Jane I ever smoked when I was younger .

@@119998848 @8998848/ 214805 @qwx1074805 <p> This is a very nice tobacco flavor , the closest that we offer to the real thing . Based on the molecule Tabanon ( a.k.a Tabanone ) . We are not using Tabanone from China , since the purity of the product does not seem to be as high as the Tabanon from Symrise ( Germany ) . <p> This is a strong flavor , try at 8% ( or even 4% ) and let it age ( see the review below ) <p> Tabanone is an important tobacco note molecule , and it appears in many tobacco blends used for flavoring tobacco . <p> good flavor but in looking for a closer tobacco flavor might get the red next time .

I can see how others might not like it if they had no experience with Premium flavor tobacco analogs . But if you are like me , and enjoyed richer analogs then you will like this flavor . I found that a little honeysuckle flavor added can produce a perfect vape while drinking some beers or just chilling out . Once it steeps , it gets DARK caramel color . The darkness and richness of this will gunk up your coils a bit sooner than lighter liquids , but it 's worth it . I will buy the largest size available next time I need some . 214806 @qwx1074806 214804 @qwx1074804 <p> yummy <p> April 4 , 2013 <p> Reviewer : James Stevens from Westminster , CO United States <p> Have not used any just yet , however , this stuff smells awesome.Super fast processing and shipping , great price , giant inventory . <p> *UPDATE*Made a test batch and I am impressed .

Cinnamaldehyde is the main molecule in natural cinnamon bark , and this molecule , like pure cinnamon oil , should not be stored in non-HDPE plastic . <p> * Note : cinnamaldehyde can vary from being slightly yellow to very yellow , and so there will be color variations with this flavor . Also , this flavor does not combine well with VG-only blends . <p> I love this flavoring . I use this in mixing and a straight cinnamon redhot max vg e juice .

It took six months to a year for the mixed liquid to be tolerable , and it tastes more like blueberry or plum at this point , anyway . <p> Despite this , there were n't any reviews on the product , so I suppose it was ' buyer beware ' .

There is just a whisper of the cinnamon-brown-sugar that dominates the American version . Do not expect Granny Smith apple taste - think Golden Delicious . <p> The flavoring goes a long way . 5-7% is plenty ; more is just too much ! I like to add a few drops of FlavourArt Honey flavor .

Instead it uses a lesser known custard note called Butyric Acid . <p> This is the ingredient that other flavor companies are now using to replace Acetoin and Acetyl Propionyl for flavors like Vanilla Custard , and we were asked to create similar substitutions . We want to stress that Butyric Acid can also be a source of irritation to the lungs . <p> It is still a custard note , but usually is only used in traces , as too much of it can give an unpleasant note to a flavor . Butyric Acid is found in milk , butter , and cheeses . In fact , Butyric Acid occurs at about 2.9% in butter
