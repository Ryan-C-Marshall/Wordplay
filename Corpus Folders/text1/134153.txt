I ordered and installed a new control board , but it did n't fix the problem . What else could be causing this ? <p> Thanks , Allison <p> Then you either ordered the wrong control board for your model , or you ordered the correct control board but it came defective . Trust me on this , BIT CAN ONLY BE THE CONTROL BOARD THATS BAD WHEN THIS ISSUE HAPPENS . <p> Just double checked the part number , and I did order the correct one . It seems pretty coincidental that the new part would be faulty too . I 'm pretty sure I installed it correctly ( it was n't rocket science ) , but just to be clear , could an issue with the installation cause this ? Also , I have found that if I give it some time while it 's turning on and off , or try to restart the cycle if it eventually gives up , I have been able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption . Does this still sound like the same problem ? I hate to order the same part again if I am overlooking anything . <p> Sorry to take so long responding . I returned it and ordered a new one from repair clinic , but after reinstalling the original board , the washer has been working flawlessly for a couple of weeks now . Does this problem typically go in and out ? Is there any chance of an electrical anomaly from the outlet causing this ?

@@35343689 @4343689/ 166558 @qwx366558 <h> Fan in fridge keeps cycling on and off <p> I am an avid DIY guy ; enjoy fixing pretty much anything in/around my house . Seems the next in line is my Whirlpool Gold Side by Side . I have been out of town and upon my return , I realized the fan in my fridge keeps cycling on and off . My roommate can not tell me how long it has been like that because his ears are n't as sensitive as mine I guess . But I know there was no cooling issue otherwise he would have called me So the fridge is cooling no problem . The compressor is working fine and does n't stall ( at least for now ) . I did some research online and realized it is the fan issue . Just to make sure it is what I think it is , I opened the lower rear panel and reached the compressor compartment . It was pretty clean for an 9-year-old unit . So I started the fridge and compressor kicked in and the compressor fan came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that the cool air was blowing so the evaporator fan was also working . I waited for about a minute and the fan started cycling . It goes off for one second and then comes back on . It stays on up to 5-10 minutes max and then cycles again . Sometimes it cycles several times in a minute . It is totally random . I would say the most it goes running without an interruption is about 10 minutes ( and this happens rarely ) . But when it is off , it is off for only 1 second . And this is the reason why I still have cooling inside the fridge and freezer . But this continuous cycling not normal and worries me that the fan motor will go out and then I will start having serious issues . When I was cleaning the compressor area , I also found out something which I think could be a lead to determine the possible cause ! .. When the fan turns off , it IS N'T only the evaporator fan inside the cabin , it is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I opened the rear , I was thinking only the evaporator fan was having issues . Now I know both fan units stop . I think both fans are controlled by the same circuit . Anyways they both stop for only a second ; It is never more ! .. it is so quick that you wo n't even see the blades slowing down , you just feel it when you touching the motor body . And during the cycling , you hear the distinct relay noise . I think the noise coming from the box that is located right next to the compressor . The gray plastic box labelled as Embraco vcc3 1156 ( 09 A 52 ) . I checked online and it seems this is the inverter box . However , I am not sure if this is the problem . Most of the posts I read shows the culprit as the control board in similar cases . I am not sure if this issue ( fan cycling ) happens all the time or only when the compressor is running . The compressor I have must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes it runs so quietly that you need to touch it to make sure it is running . So it is possible that once the compressor turns off , fan cycling will stop as well . I could n't determine this for sure yet . <p> So I would need your help to determine the faulty part and once I figure it out , I am sure I can do the replacement . I just do n't want to waste time and money by replacing the wrong part . <p> I can provide any additional info ( test/reading etc. ) if needed . I would appreciate if any of you experienced techs steer me into the right direction ... <p> Thank you Rick for taking your time and replying to my thread . First of all I am really disappointed that a 9-year-old fridge is considered it has served long enough that the manufacturers discontinued this important part ( especially since the part is known for this infamous issue ) . <p> I will try to get the part repaired as you suggested . If you would n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located ? Is it easy to take out ? Asking all these because I am trying to figure out if the fridge needs to be emptied out for the replacement or it could be done without . With the normal settings , the fridge can keep everything cool for hours if the doors kept closed . <p> Also I am wondering if my compressor is variable rpm type since it seems to work at different levels . Sometimes it is impossible to hear but it is working . <p> The inverter compressor is a reciprocating , variable-speed , 4-pole type . It operates on 3-phase , 80 to 240 VAC within a range of 57 to 104 Hz . The use of 3-phase power eliminates the need for the relay , capacitor , and individual start and run windings ; therefore , the start , run , and common pins found on conventional compressors are not applicable on this 3-phase model . Compressor pin functions are identical and compressor lead wire configuration is of no importance . The compressor is controlled by the inverter , which receives its signal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverter changes the compressor speed . Compressor speed is based on the temperature set point in conjunction with the specific cabinet temperature . Speeds are selected according to cabinet temperatures , with freezer temperature being the primary . A resistance of 9 ohms to 11 ohms should be read between any 2 of the 3 pins . Should an opening occur in the compressor winding or should one of the compressor lead wires become open or disconnected , the inverter will stop voltage output to the compressor . Compressor operation is extremely smooth and cool . The compressor exterior may be slightly higher than room temperature while operating ; therefore , it may be difficult to detect a running unit . <p> Originally Posted by iskoos <p> I wonder why it is loud sometimes and very quiet the other . <p> When the compressor is running at high speed it is possible to hear it working . However , it 's not loud . There is no reason to think that 's a problem as our definitions of loud could be different . <p> Thank you again Rick for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't mean it is loud to the point it gives someone a headache . It is just that you could sense that something is running . But when it operates at low speed , it is impossible to hear that . So then I was right in thinking it is a variable speed compressor . <p> I am getting ready to remove and send that board for a rebuild . I will see who will give me the best deal . In the meanwhile , I have to figure out how to go by several days without a fridge . Never happened before <p> May I ask one last question ? I have been closely inspecting the operation of the fridge during the past couple days and I realized that the compressor and the fan units ( both of them ) never completely stop working . I always hear the fans running very quietly and the compressor is always on at low speed mode even in the night times . Is this the normal operating behavior of this kind of fridge or this is also the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about how to picture the evaporator today as I believe it is inside the freezer cabin and to get to that , I need to empty the freezer and so some disassembly ; and that means stopping the fridge most likely . I have been trying not to open the fridge doors much these days so it does n't have to work hard . The fan ( both condenser and evap. ) stop &amp; go keeps going unfortunately Sometimes it gets worse and it stops &amp; go maybe 15-20 times in a minute and sometimes it goes running for over 5 minutes . This afternoon the fridge scared me a bit . I walked into the kitchen and it was super quiet . I heard neither the compressor nor any fan running . I thought it finally stopped working for a second , then I started hearing some thermal expansion kind of sound like something was moving slowly . I went behind the fridge and I saw the compressor and the condenser fan were completely off and some water was dripping into the pan . Then I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took about 10 minutes during which about a cup of water drained into the pan . I checked the temps and freezer rose to 13F ( from 0F set point ) and fridge was around 45F ( from 37F ) . After the defrost , compressor started working at high speed for about 25 minutes . During this 25 minutes , fans ran for 5 and 8 minutes ( not consecutive ) without any interruption . Then stop &amp; go started again at a random pace . Compressor temp was at 145F at the end of the 25-minute high-speed run . At low-speed , temp gets down to 115F level and stays there . I am not getting a refurbished board Rick . It is n't worth paying $400 . I will just send mine in for a rebuild since it is qualified for a repair due to well-known fan issue . Guys at South Carolina doing it for $99 . With shipping ( both ways ) , I will be paying around $120-130 . Their turnaround time is 1 day ; pretty good . If this fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more . So far every forum post I read , indicates that this is a control board issue . But I am not an appliance pro like you . If you are saying we need to look at something else , I do my best to work with you . It just seems that under these conditions , it may be worth taking the risk of spending some $100 . The worst part is going through a while week without a fridge <p> Hi there , It has been over a week and I thought I would update this adventure for Rick and those who would be following . After the last communication with Rick , my plan was to send my control board off to repair . It was a weekend and I had to wait till Monday . I was n't going to sit around and wait 2 days without doing anything ; I did some online research to see what these guys were going to replace on this control board . And I found out that for this repair 2 components ( totaling less than $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Steve Jenkins . He summarized his repair adventure into a blog with pictures , links and everything else ( one might ever need ) for others to follow and save some money . Go Steve ... The 2 components are a small capacitor and a general purpose relay . After reading his blog several times over the weekend , I decided to see if I can get these parts and give this a shot before sending my board off to someone else and pay over $100 . Monday morning , I found the capacitor very easily in town but the relay was n't available . I had to order one online and possibly wait for a few days to a week . It would be possible to get it in 24 hours of course but you would pay $20 shipping for a $3 part and I do n't do that unless I absolutely have no other option . If I send the board to repair , I was going to take the fridge offline for a few days anyways so ordering the relay and waiting for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fridge would keep cycling on &amp; off like crazy and this was bothering me a lot . I wanted to act quick . I started thinking that the faulty component would n't be the relay since it was working on &amp; off . I could hear the click every time it gets energized and the fan would start running ; then it would get interrupted for a second , fan would turn off and then back on again . The same cycle for every hour , every day . If the fan was n't staying on as required , and if the relay was working okay ( this is what I was thinking ) something must be causing power interruption between the relay and the control circuit . And a defective capacitor was more like what I was thinking . Plus I had a replacement capacitor in my hands . So I decided to turn the fridge off one morning and pulled the board out to inspect . And I was very pleased with what I see . The capacitor in question was bulged up at the top indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shop in half an hour and put the board back in the fridge without touching the relay . I powered up the fridge and it started running with both fans ( condenser and evaporator ) coming on . I waited behind the fridge for about 10 minutes to see if the fan would cycle . The most this fan would go without interruption ( prior to my repair attempt ) was about 5-8 minutes . So after 10 minutes , I was happy but I would n't call it a victory yet . I let the fridge run for days . Now it is on its 8th day and all seems to be working fine ... Fans only stop during the defrost cycle and in the night times when the fridge not in much use . I guess this should be the expected behavior . Well , I completed this repair by just replacing a capacitor ( $0.50 ) . This is against the recommended action per Steve Jenkins ' blog but the capacitor was the only available item in my hands at the time . Later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panasonic EEU-EB1J221 ( a better one ) to have in my hands in case the same/similar happens in the future . I also ordered the recommended surge protector and installed it . I am not sure if this really happened due to an electrical surge but I just did n't want to take any chance . So in short , my fridge is right now functioning properly and I hope it would keep going like this I wanted to thank to this great forum , Rick ( The Moderator ) and Steve J. for his amazing blog . I am going to include a link to his blog right here for others to take a look . If you are experiencing a similar issue , you would n't lose anything by reading his blog . Also a couple pictures from my repair . The below pictures show the defective capacitor and you may see how it bulged up ...

Help on locating the control board and or replacement board if a failed component is n't obvious would be appreciated . <h> Cap Replacement worked for me too , thanks ! ! ! ! ! <p> I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ran diagnostics and the evap fan showed failure code " 2 " every time it beeped/clicked and momentarily shut down . So , ordered the fan motor and waited 5 days for it to arrive only to find out when I installed it that it did nothing to help my problem . After looking at my options for a main board ( $700 for a rebuilt board or $225 and 10 days of no refer to get mine repaired ) , I thought it could n't hurt to try Nick 's fix . I can sorta solder , but that 's the extent of my electronics knowledge . <p> Anyhow , replaced the cap he indicated ( 220 uf 35 v ) with a $1.49 replacement from RadioShack . It 's working great .

He thinks it was most likely damaged due to a power surge/brown out that we have had due to sever storms in our area ? Thanks ! <p> Rick thanks for part number . What part number is control board that is labelled #5 on that same diagram ? The repair shop called back and said they would order 2 controllers , the 1st one you mentioned and the second one she said was W2318054 but I can not find that part anywhere . Can you tell me what the correct part number is for that 2nd board . Do you really think I need to replace both boards or just the main one ? Thanks so much !

Do this ; First remove power from the machine and shut off the water supply . Using the pinouts on the control board , measure the resistance of the fill valve solenoid and the DC fan motor .

@@35343703 @4343703/ 166558 @qwx366558 <h> Loud pop and flash <p> For several months , whenever something on the stove created steam , if we then used the microwave we were greeted with a loud " pop " and flash . Then it worked correctly . No problems unless boiling something on range prior . As it approached the end of warranty , I called a local service company who replaced the board . After that , under the steaming conditions it hummed continuously but worked . Last night it was louder than normal , smelled and did n't work . Service company tells me it needs a magnetron , capacitor and diode . Hard to believe that these problems are not related . What 's your experience ? <p> The Mag Tube , Capacitor , and Diode is the entire high voltage side of the microwave less the transformer . I find that a little hard to believe that all three went out at the same time . Maybe if you were cooking nuclear waste . Was there a fire in it ? I do n't believe a fire would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like the board either but that 's water under the bridge . Did it go away with the new board ? How long after the board was replaced did the humming sound start ? Was it taking longer to cook ? The loud humming and burning smell should make it easy to figure what 's wrong . Something is burned in there . How comfortable are you working with electricity and do you have or have access to a VOM ? <p> Thanks for the quick reply ! The tech indicated that all three were probably not bad , but he liked to replace them together . The predictable loud pop and flash did seem to go away after the board replacement , but was replaced immediately with the humming ( when moisture was present ) . Do n't believe that there was any difference in the amount of cooking time required . We are still in " negotiations " about who is responsible for this repair . My position is that the problem was never repaired correctly while the unit was under warranty , which expired Jan 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture has to do with my problems and what to do to correct it . <p> I do n't know what would cause that kind of problem . It must have been something on the control board if it went away after it was replaced . Replacing the board would n't cause a high side component to fail , nor would moisture . It would have to be a lot of moisture to cause a short . I 've never heard of replacing all the high side components if one goes out . The humming could be coming from the High Voltage Transformer . Let 's get jeff1 opinion on this . He 's a good microwave tech . He may have heard of this issue before . <p> On OTR microwave is suppose to be built to go over a range ! Why is steam effecting/effected the pcboard ? <p> Consumer is not turning on the fan when using the surface burners Why is n't the fan coming on on it 's own ... it should if the bottom of the microwave is getting too hot . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venting sized correctly Install is wrong height above range top ? <p> *If* this unit was going to be repaired under warranty I understand what the tech is doing .... no diagnosing .... order all the parts we -may- need to cover all the bases . This is a common practice today <p> Steam can certainly damage the PCBoard but shouldn't/would n't effect the mag/diode/capacitor ! <p> Well , Frigidaire refused to step up on this so I am faced with fixing it myself or putting it at the curb . How do I test to determine exactly which component is bad ? I have another one just like it that quit working after the warranty period , but I suspect it has the same bad magnetron . <p> Like I said , I have two of these units so I took the three suspect parts from both .

Recently sometimes when in use , the top and back of the dryer very hot at times to touch . Other times it is fine . It just started to let off this smell like it 's overheating . It has not tripped breakers or shut off at all . It stinks up the whole house , and the clothes in it . I also noticed that while it was making this smell as it was almost done drying the load in it , it said it has 7 minutes left . I went in a couple minutes later and the timer was back up to 30 something minutes ! I do n't know why it would reset itself I guess . My husband has been taking parts off trying to figure something out . Any help would be appreciated ! ! ! ! ! Thank you . <p> The first thing you should do is , take the vent hose off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if there is a flapper in it , make sure it 's not sticking closed and there 's enough air flow to open it . It can also be caused by a shorted element . Sometimes the element coils will warp slightly from all the heat and touch the side of the element housing . Make sure the blower wheel is n't loose on the motor shaft . That can also cause the over heating problem . Make sure there is n't any lint build up inside the lint filter or blower housing . Basically , take the dryer apart and give it a good cleaning , check the element with an ohmmeter to ground , and check the blower wheel . That will most likely solve the problem . It could be a thermistor or thermostat but we 'll cross that bridge after we rule out the rest . <p> Thank you . My husband has taken the parts off the dryer to clean them out . All of the vents are clear and it blows freely outside . So I think the blower is working right since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cold out ) . He took the heating element out and looked at it , but it looks fine , although that may be where the smell is coming from . If a heating element is not working right could it be causing it to be overheating ? We thought if it was n't working right , we would get no hot air instead of too much I guess . But that 's why we are here , since we do n't know the slightest bit about appliances . Haha . He put the dryer back together and turned it on to test it . And after running for just 30 seconds the smell was like automatically there . The tumbler is also turning around fine . <p> OK , let 's start by checking for fault codes and testing the moisture sensor . Be sure the dryer is in standby mode ( plugged in with all indicators off , or with only the Dry indicator on ) . Select any one button ( except Control Lock and Start/Pause ) and follow these steps : Using the same button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2 seconds&gt; Press/ hold for 2 seconds&gt; Release for 2 seconds&gt; Press/ hold for 2 second . If this test mode has been entered successfully , all indicators on the console are illuminated for 5 seconds with 8:88 showing in the Estimated Time Remaining three-digit display . If there are no saved fault codes or active fault codes , center board indicators on the console will momentarily turn off , then stay on with 8:88 displayed . If entry into Diagnostic Test Mode is unsuccessful , choose a different button ( except Control Lock and Start/Pause ) and repeat . If there is an active fault code , it will be flashing in the display . If there is no active fault code , 8:88 will be displayed , center board indicators momentarily turn off , and then all the indicator lights will be turned on . If there are any saved fault codes , the most recent code will show " F : " and flash " XX " where " XX " is the fault code . If there are no fault codes , open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside of the dryer . Wet your finger and bridge both strips . If a continuous beep tone is heard and an alphanumeric number is displayed on the console , the sensor is OK . If a continuous beep tone is not heard or is heard before bridging the two metal strips , there 's a problem with the moisture sensor . Press the Power/Cancel button to exit diagnostics . <p> So I did what you said , and 88 and all the lights came up for about 5 seconds , then all shut off for a second , then all came back on and stayed on with the 88 in the time window . I checked the sensor and there was a continuous beeping as I held my finger on it . I also want to thank you for all your help ! ! Our local appliance guy said he does n't mess with they type of dryer we have . And Sears wants a ridiculous amount just to come look at it . Hopefully we can pinpoint the problem . <p> Recently sometimes when in use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times to touch .

There 's always a fudge factor with testing components remotely . That being said , let 's rule out any electrical issues with everything but the element . Run the dryer on air fluff or no heat for about 30-40 minutes and see if the smell is still present . If not , run the dryer on low heat and see if the smell returns . That should give me a idea where to concentrate my efforts . I should also mention that intermittent problems similar to yours are caused by air flow issues 90% of the time . Make sure the little holes in the lint filter are not clogged . That 's a common problem with the use of dryer sheets . Also check the air holes in front of the lint filter and make sure they 're not plugged up . <p> I switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly back . <p> " Instantly back " makes me think something must have gotten onto the element coils . The air flow path is as follows : When the machine is turned on , the blower actually sucks the air through the open end of the element housing , across the element coils , into the drum and through the lint filter and blower housing . The blower then pushes the air out of the blower housing . through the vent tube and vent hose and exits outside . If you 're smelling it instantly , nothing else has a chance to get hot enough except the coils . Try replacing the element and hope that eliminates the smell . I should tell you that the element alone does n't emit any smells except for a few minutes when it 's new and turned on for the first time . Unless something else is on the coils and burning when the element is on , replacing the element may not solve the problem . If the air flow is blocked , the heat from the element will pile up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to melt , like wires or thermostats attached to the housing . Taking the element out and looking at it is not a good enough test . You need to check the element terminals to ground with an ohmmeter for a possible short . <p> There is a video now to show you how to access/replace the heating element on this model . Just click the part link below and the video is there .

The rim the washer lid sits on had gotten bent when some workers moved the W/D a few weeks back ( to get at the pipes behind it ) .

These 2 oval joints have obvious cracks around them AND I am sure there are several more so do n't just solder those joints but use a strong magnifying glass ( jewelers loop works great ) and look at all the joints on that board for cracks like those I pointed out . If not sure take it to a TV repair shop they will know what to look for .

The tubes go into a metal box that says high heat . The dispenser is connected with a thin clear tube ( the only one not black ) . Its the hose that has a nozzle connector with a little rubber ball to it . I opened up the nozzle to check if maybe the ball inside got defective but it looks just fine . <p> I noticed a while back that it was leaking a little bit . I opened the top cover and found the hose was split . I looked and looked and tried several hoses , but they were either a little too hard or a little too loose .

The drain solenoid should be in the same position as the original when mounted . I carry one with me in the field . It replaces many GE pump/motors. 
@@35343742 @4343742/ 166558 @qwx366558 <p> I have been browsing the forum and can not locate a match to this problem . <p> My washing machine will run up until the start of the rinse cycle . <p> During the washing cycle , there is a bit of a grinding noise . <p> Whether its on the Delicates , normal wash , or the wrinkle free cycle , the same thing happens . the machine starts to transition to the rinse cycle , but seems to get hung up . There is a faint burning smell when that happens , and then the machine stops running , so I manually turn it off . <p> I have recently replaced the drain pump . <p> To trouble shoot I have removed the belt . The motor , and the pump spin both directions freely without noise or significant friction . The transmission pulley will spin clockwise freely , but there is a lot of resistance counterclockwise ( looking from the bottom up ) . I am not sure if that is normal . <p> I am guessing that a bearing has seized up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch due to the fact of the burning smell <p> After the wash agitation , it does not drain . All it will do is fill the tub and agitate the load . After that , the machine stops doing anything , the timer dial stops moving , and a faint burning smell starts , that 's when I manually turn it off . So I am left with un-rinsed clothes with the tub still full . <p> I am not sure where the smell comes from , but I will do an empty load and see if I can find it . There is a grinding noise during agitation , not loud , but definitely noticeable , and the smell does n't start until after the machine gets stuck at the start of the rinse cycle . The only noise I 've noticed when the machine stops is a slight " thud " and maybe a faint hum . <p> I have taken a video of what 's happening with my machine and uploaded it to youtube ( front panel removed ) . Below is a link . I am 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the transmission , but i can only get my head so far into the machine . It may be hard to hear , but in the first 45 seconds of the video , you can notice the high speed clicking sound over the normal agitation sound . Then at the : 50 mark of the video , it pauses between cycles , and tries to start the rinse cycle . the timer dial is still moving at this point . Then the motor shifts its position when the rinse tries to start . It " jams " and then smell of electrical burning starts . Hope the video helps . What 's wrong with my washing maching ? - YouTube <p> ok , ill get started on that . the only pulley that does n't turn freely in BOTH directions , is the transmission pulley . It spins clockwise freely , but not counter clockwise , a lot of resistance that direction . <p> The motor is going into reverse for drain/spin but something is preventing the motor shaft from rotating . Could be that the brake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand , the lower cam should cause the pulley to push up on the thrust bearing and release the brake . You should be able to see that from under the machine . <p> So the machine goes into the rinse mode without the belt attached , and the motor is spinning if the belt is not attached during the rinse cycle . I have spun the transmission pulley CCW but it does not seem to release the brake or get any easier ... It actually seems to have some reverse tension if there is such a thing ... It snaps back 1/8-1/4 turn after I spin it CCW . <p> When I manually turn the wheel , I do not see any cam/brake release from the underside of the machine . All I can see is the wheel turning . <p> It sounds like , the thrust bearing is worn out and not releasing the brake completely . <p> Now the big transmission pulley , you turn it one direction and you will see the agitator moving , then turn it the other direction and it should release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the tub does n't turn then the thrust bearing is bad . <p> Appears to me that the motor pivot spring is broken or missing ? In agitate mode , the motor is pivoted all the way in one direction and when switched to spin mode , it slams all the way in the other direction . Check the pivot spring . It attaches between the motor base plate and the motor on the side of the motor that faces the center of the washer.

Most people do n't turn on a surface burner on unless they 're cooking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cooking , not just an open flame , the microwave is built to take the heat . Most of the electronics are on the top of the microwave and there are several thermal cutoffs positioned around the microwave designed to open if they get too hot . There is also at least one normally open thermostat . If it gets too hot , either from the cooktop or the microwave , the thermostat closes and turns the vent fan on automatically . Just use common sense and you 'll be fine . Many years ago I had a customer that was using her gas range to heat the house . She had all four surface burners going and a microwave above it . When she smelled smoke she called the fire department . The cabinets on each side of the microwave caught fire .

The plastic parts of a microwave will deform over time and the possibility of the high limit tripping while cooking can happen . Also the hood fan is not powerful enough to draw the cooking odors out fast enough . Better to get a dedicated range hood .

I have a U-Line Beverage refrigerator . It had a leak in the evaporator line that I repaired with a pierce valve . <p> ( Did n't pierce the pipe , just used the compression aspect of it to seal it . ) Pulled -30 " &amp; repair held . <p> Went to recharge the system but now the compressor cycles on 2 seconds &amp; off for 23 seconds .

My multimeter is a ' mid level ' Tenma 72-7770 . ( Not sure if it is precise . ) <p> Will send photo of repair valve . ( If needed . ) It is a valve you clamp on a line . It has a screw on the housing of the valve that when turned in pierces the line and now that screw becomes an on &amp; off valve . <p> I had to install one in order to charge the system and i then found the leak and installed a second one to seal the leak ( without turning the piercing screw in ) . As a back up I did put in some super seal advaced . <p> The repair initially worked but after 2 weeks i noticed the refrigerator not cooling . Compressor was running but charge was low .

I made sure the blade could rotate with minimal pushing from my fingers . Put everything back together , hit manual drain , but then nothing . I will try to run a full cycle soon to see if it will drain . <p> Thanks for your tips . I followed the video and removed the drain pump . No clog found , neither in the pipes . Tested the drain pump outside the dishwasher , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran the manual drain cycle and it worked ok . Then ran a full wash cycle and everything seems to work normally <p> I suspect it might have been a loose power connection to the drain pump . Thanks for your informative posts . When the next appliance failure occurs , I 'll be back !

Last year at Christmas I purchased a Frigidaire range here in Honduras . I chose Frigidaire because I wanted a reliable appliance here in Honduras where there are no service people that I can locate . After changing out the orifices to accommodate LP gas , this oven/range has been a dream come true until just before this Christmas . After baking a ham , the next day neither the oven nor the broiler would ignite . Everything else on the range works just fine . When I try to start the oven the readout on the control panel reads 100 with the red underline , and I can feel the heat from the igniter inside the oven after 90 seconds . When I try to start the broiler it is the same , and the readout on the control panel reads 550 with the red underline . <p> It seems that you guys are helping out a lot of folks with similar problems and I would be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through . I will be traveling up to the USA in a couple of weeks and could buy any parts that you think I may need , or if you sell them I can have you send them to my freight forwarder in Miami . <p> Start by measuring the resistance of the oven sensor . It should measure 1100 ohms at room temperature . It 's unusual for both bake and broil to stop working at the same time . I looked at the wiring diagram for a similar model and what makes this so unusual is the only thing the two have in common is the oven sensor . You said both igniters turn on but there 's no flame for either bake or broil . The first thing I thought of was the oven safety valve but it 's a dual valve , separate bake and broil . The EOC has a bake relay and a broil relay and they both work or the igniters would n't turn on . It 's possible for an oven igniter to turn on and glow red and still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ca n't draw the necessary 3.2 - 3.6 amps to oven safety valve . Your range is less than a year old and to have both igniters get weak at the same time when both are new the odds would be about a million to one . So it ca n't be the igniters . The 120 VAC necessary to turn the igniters on means the EOC and oven safety valve is good . The only thing left is the oven sensor . I have my doubts that would cause it but I 'm not sure on that model because it 's too new and I do n't have any service information on that particular model .

I tried that several times for 15 minutes and it kept refusing to start . <p> I disconnected it from the power a couple of times , waited a minute , and tried again . No luck . So then I went to Google and started researching and found that my door switches may be the culprit . With the unit still attached to the wall , I open the control board/keyboard and had little access to the switches . I took out the T10 screws and got the switch holders out .

I 'll test its impedence tomorrow but thought I ask if this may be a clue . <p> Thanks Jeff ! Just wanted to update everyone that it was indeed the 2 upper door switches of this unit . I 'm not sure if both were originally broken , or if I broke one while taking it out ( one switch separated in half when I tried to take it out of the clips - broke the clips too and needed a new interlock ) . <p> I did not know what my auto-ranging digital ohm meter was telling me until I tested the 3rd bottom switch . My two upper switches were showing fluctuating ohm readings on the closed circuit which confused me but in the end showed they were faulty . You should have reading of infinity for open circuit and very close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All in all , problem solved . One other thing to note that Whirlpool has changed one of the switches 2 times ( i.e. different part numbers now ) perhaps suggesting a faulty/problematic switch in the first place .

Then see if you can get something to fish out whatever is in there . <p> Thanks Jake , will give that a try .

This is just a terrible design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that space , or provide a reasonable way to get debris out . Perhaps having a wider water outlet with a 2 stage filter ( large and small items ) .

@@35343853 @4343853/ 166558 @qwx366558 <p> I 've searched for and read many postings about washers that still spin , but the clothes are still very wet after the spin cycle . <p> This situation has happened recently with my washer . <p> And have read that this can be due to problems with various parts or clothes stuck in between the baskets or in the pump or pump hoses . <p> But since am seeing one specific behavior/symptom hardly ever mentioned , I wanted to ask about that here . <p> Details : <p> 1 . After the spin , ( and I can visually see it spinning in this case ) , the clothes are really almost sopping wet which was not the case before . <p> 2 . The washer fills , agitates , drains and rinses ok ( drains completely in same short amt of time as in the past ) <p> 3 . Here are the specific behaviors I see related to the spin cycle now : <p> a. sometimes during the spin cycle , and there is no water in the tub at this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitates and keeps agitating , but the spinning does not start <p> b. but other times , the spinning does start and lasts throughout the spin cycle , but as mentioned , the clothes are still wet ( and there is no water in the tub at this time also ) <p> For both these cases , I can hold down the lid switch and can see the behaviors described . <p> c. when it does spin , it does start off agitating for about 10 seconds until the drum starts spinning and then the agitating stops ; I do n't know if this is typical or if not , if its an additional clue to the problem . <p> d. when it does spin , sometimes rarely there is a thumping noise once or twice during the entire spin cycle , but usually not . However , in general the sound when spinning is just not as I remember it ; which I guess makes sense since its not getting the spin speed it used to get . <p> 5 . From web searches , have read at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spin cycle , and it does not spin , that it is a transmission problem . <p> 6 . But since the " agitate during spin cycle/does not spin " situation happens relatively rarely , I want to ask if it still means that seeing this symptom at all does mean that it is a transmission problem <p> vs it perhaps being one of the many other possibilities for the general problem of washer spinning but clothes still very wet ( but all water has drained from the tub ) ? <p> 7 . If it is the transmission , then I can stop and look for a new or used replacement , since the transmission parts for my model are very high . ( and I 'd not be able to do that level of work myself in any case ) <p> But if not , then I can try to analyse further to see if its worth having someone come out to look . <p> Thanks for any information on this situation and what you think the problem(s) might be . Please let me know if more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread <p> Thanks for the information that its the transmission and related parts . <p> I 've seen a change in the symtoms this week but I 'm guessing that the change is still related to the transmission also , but wanted to mention them in case not : <p> 1 . during the agitate cycle , it now sounds like a loud thumping ; the agitator does agitate , but I 'm not using that cycle now since do n't  want to make it worse . <p> 2. however , the spin cycle is now back to normal ; it works well and the agitator does not agitate during the spin as before . I never realized how well this washer spun the clothes until now ; I just took it for granted . <p> 3. thus for now am working around by doing a long pre-soak with the soap in and hot water , and then manually moving the clothes up and down by hand ; adding a bit more water so its easier to do this <p> then doing the drain and spin as in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the clothes were so wet after the spin . <p> ===&gt; Would the thumping sound now during agitation and that the spin cycle is now back to normal , be just another indication its still the transmission ? ( since I think the transmission is involved with both the agitation and the spinning , and perhaps some section or subparts of it might be on the edge of going out completely , and thus sometimes one symptom shows and sometimes the other one ? ) <p> Yes , you were right about the coming back to haunt - a few days later it finally went out . <p> I 'm not pursuing fixing it due to cost of transmission but am curious as to what happened at the end - <p> --- instead of doing the drain and spin , which it had been doing , there was just a low but loud hum , and then 10 seconds later also an acrid , strong smell . I turned it off and unplugged it then . A day later I plugged it back in and turned it on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately unplugged it . I 've not touched it since . <p> The fill cycle still works . <p> ===&gt; Was the smell probably from the transmission itself burning up or from the motor or related wires or parts burning up as it strained to start the broken transmission to do the drain and spin ?

No weird sounds or anything just a lot of water and a code ( nf ) which I believe is for " no fill " which makes sense since all the water was all over the floor . <p> I called Samsung on this one and since we are out of warranty they re-routed me through some special department for claims since we had other parts of the house affected . We have a tech coming today . They said they are covering the parts and labor for the repair AND any damage from the flooding-- which is nothing right now . I have to move some stuff around to check out an are of flooring that got water underneath it . <p> Ok-- yesterday the tech came in and took one look at the washer and said-- " drain pump problem " . Apparently the drain pump on these washers was attached very close to the drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with it if the load became unbalanced-- which is what happened here . This tech had all the parts with him and relocated a new pump to the other side away from the drum . Then he told us that Samsung redesigned the washer in Sept. 2012 to correct this flaw . Our washer was manufactured in Aug. 2012 . <p> UPDATE ! ! About 6 months after all of this-- this POS Samsung sprung another leak although not a huge one ! Not wanting to wait for it to go bad and fed up with this particular model we ditched it in favor of a bare bones Kenmore that did just as good a job washing as this one did . Long story short we have since moved out of state and left all of this behind ... But we still get the urgent Samsung recall notices via email as that Samsung is apparently the model that was exploding ... I keep unsubscribing but they keep sending them .

On day 2 , the freezer stopped cooling . I know the compressor is working cause I unplugged it and it started freezing again , but the #4 started flashing and it shut it back off . I 'm guessing after reading the forums is that its the damper control that is causing the #4 flashing and this will also go into a safe mode that shuts down the freezer from causing more damage .

Is there another part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me this part would work in mine , part # 241600905 . Is this true ? And should I go straight to the control panel and replace it instead ?

Thanks again . <p> Ok , so I replaced the air damper on my fridge . Made sure it was all hooked up correctly and plugged it back in . It 's still flashing the number 4 on the fresh food side .

Once the lid has locked the second time , the washer will slowly spin the dry load to estimate the load size , and begin adding water .

This is very important since most complaints start with the lid lock on and blinking , or the unit will not start and spin . <p> If , when in diagnostics the codes are F7E1 , F7E5 , or motor speed codes , then chances are it is a motor , capacitor , or shifter related issue .

Put the dryer back together , again , worked fine when turned on and run the first time , heated properly , but blew cool air the second time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get any ideas on what to check or personal experiences on what causes dryers to blow thermal cut-offs like this so I do n't keep throwing parts at it . <p> There is NO blockage anywhere , dryer is extremely clean and there was no lint buildup at all , the vent system goes straight out an unrestricted 4-inch pipe . <p> I checked the heating element for a short to the housing ( or the metal plate it 's mounted to ) as one of the first steps , using a multimeter and checking each end of the coil . <p> I 've taken apart the element assembly to inspect it visually , the element looks great , has the correct 10 ohms reading at room temp , and is not touching the housing or any other metal when assembled ( verified again with multimeter ) . <p> Also checked a lot of other things - the thermistor reads the correct 10K ohms at room temp , and goes to 7K ohms when warmed and about 15K ohms when cool . The second thermostat cut-off ( right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown and shows continuity . <p> The motor runs fine and is getting 120V , and the heater relay seems to be working and getting 240V since the element heats up , at least once the dryer is first started up after replacing the thermal cut-off . I 've even checked the centrifugal switch at the motor , and while it does n't read as the exact 2.88 ohms between pin 3 and 4 or the 3.5 ohms between pin 4 and 5 that the troubleshooting manual calls for , it does read at least 2.5 ohms and goes close to 2.8/3.2 so I 'm pretty sure the switch is n't causing it either . <p> There are no error displays or diagnostic codes . Test mode does n't reveal anything since the dryer runs fine otherwise , just has blown two thermal cut-offs with no obvious cause . <p> At this point I 'm guessing it 's the main PCB ( Samsung Part No .

Sure do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not the PCB though . <p> What about the normal on and off heats , checked them to see what the temp is cycling the element on and off ? <p> Not sure what " the normal on and off heats " means here . <p> There is no cycling of the element on and off - the thermal cut-off just blows the second time the dryer is run and so there is no heat . <p> Should I bypass the cut-off and check to see what temps the element gets up to with a non-contact thermometer or something like that ? <p> Maybe I should have let the dryer run longer with the new thermal cut-off to see if it would overheat and/or blow the thermal cut-off like that , but it seemed fine , only seems to blow the cut-off the second time the dryer is run . <p> That is what happens normally .... dryer heats up ( EG : 150F ) and the heat cycles off , dryer cools to ( EG:110F ) and the heat comes back on .... getting an idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , etc ) can help as to why the thermal/high limit keeps opening up . Vent off , test with no clothes inside and a thermometer at the dryers exit ... record the temps . <p> Ok , checked the heat cycling with both a 200*F meat thermometer at the exhaust vent and a non-contact infrared thermometer . The meat thermometer seemed pretty dang accurate , even more so than the infrared , which showed about 10-15 degrees less than the meat thermometer , even when held very close to the vent and pointed at the inside walls . Guess they really are n't so great for checking air temperature . <p> Did the first run on " normal " cycle ( which seems to use the moisture sensor ) it went up to 140-150*F on the meat thermometer and stayed there , showed slightly less on the infrared . The dryer stopped automatically on it 's own after about 2-3 minutes . <p> Did the second run right after , on the " timed dry " cycle , with highest heat setting selected . It took a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another minute , then slowly went to 160*F , then 170*F , and backed off , taking only 10-20 seconds to go all the way back down to 140*F , where it held for another 10-20 seconds , then slowly climbed to 150*F again , then 160* , and finally 170*F , where it stayed for a 10-20 seconds , then backed off again all the way to 140*F . <p> So , two complete cycles getting up to 140*F , going all the way to 170*F , and back down to 140*F . <p> I guess this means the thermal cycling is okay and the cut-off is n't blowing because of high heating element temps . <p> It is good that it is cycling the heat off , cooling down and cycling the heat back on .... but 170F is a bit too hot to me .... 160-165F might be better .... has any body cleaned off the thermistor facing to make sure no dryer sheet gunk or such is built up on the sensor facing ? <p> What else blows a thermal cut-off ? <p> Thermal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that is a loose connection caused the voltage to drop and the amps to increase to compensate . <p> It is good that it is cycling the heat off , cooling down and cycling the heat back on .... but 170F is a bit too hot to me .... 160-165F might be better .... has any body cleaned off the thermistor facing to make sure no dryer sheet gunk or such is built up on the sensor facing ? <p> I do n't know for sure that the temp was EXACTLY 170*F , it may have actually been 165*F but the analog thermo just went to about the 170*F mark before dropping . The high limit thermostat I used was the brand new one I just bought , an OE Samsung replacement . <p> The thermistor was cleaned off gently with some water , I was wary of using electronic cleaner or anything else since I did n't want to damage the protective coating on the sensor that it seems is critical . <p> Maybe replacing the thermistor makes the most sense at this point if the temps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what trips it ... maybe amps can do that is a loose connection caused the voltage to drop and the amps to increase to compensate . <p> I realize how it 's supposed to work , but it appears that heat is n't what has tripped it , since the replacement thermal cut-offs have blown -twice- before the dryer even gets warm on the second test run after replacing it . <p> Is a thermal cut-off supposed to be " broken in " somehow or brought up to temp and cycled a few times in the initial run ? <p> If there 's nothing else wrong with the dryer , and there are no shorts , but the thermal cut-off just blows after being installed , I 'm guessing it 's user error and I 'm doing something wrong or not doing something else that I should be doing before running the dryer . <p> Yes , this is the part spec 'd by Samsung to be the high limit thermal cut-off , but it is WRONG . <p> The original part I removed was a CS-7 B-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off at 160*F . <p> The replacement DC47-00016A is actually a PC-17/PC-17S B-2 K85 thermal cut-off , which is spec 'd to cut off at 85*F . <p> Obviously what 's been happening is the 85 degree thermal cut-offs simply cut off because they hit the thermal limit even though the dryer is just at normal temps that would n't blow the 160 degree cut offs . <p> I 've also learned the trick of smacking a thermal cut-off to reset it . Not sure if a smacked reset one is as safe as a new one , but there 's continuity so I can use it instead of a jumper in the meantime . <p> I 'm guessing since the high end of the cycling temps are 170*F that I need a new thermistor and that was the original cause of the blown 160*F thermal cut-off .

A few months ago the hi-temp switch on the upper t-stat started tripping .

The t-stat stopped tripping and I thought I was home free . No such luck . It started tripping again . I noticed that before it trips the water gets extremely hot . After I reset it , it lasts for a few days or a week and trips again . I have checked the elements and they are good and not shorted or grounded .

How can I tell which one is failing ? Should I just replace both ?

The washer drains , apparently without issue . But while draining , the SPIN selection ( previously set to HIGH ) , switches to NO SPIN . Once drain is complete the wash stops , NO SPIN LED stays ON and the DOOR LOCK stays ON , until I press Cancel . Pressing the SPIN button will not adjust to HIGH or any other setting other than NO SPIN . I pulled the plug for 1 hour , an observed no change upon restart . Please help Dan <p> I have a similar problem with my Frigidaire model # FTF2140ES3 , which I bought new in December 2006 . My wife told me she ran 2 loads of laundry and there was no final spin so the clothes came out very wet but the water in the tub had drained . <p> I disconnected the power and checked the outflow hose for obstructions . I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drain pump motor , checked for obstructions ; also removed the coin trap inside the black rubber boot and that had no obstructions although there wre a couple threads of lint . Replaced all that . Removed the back panel and made sure the belt to rotate the drum was tight . I did find a couple of plastic pieces like the end of a nail that looks like they broke off . There were three of these around the large pulley as seen from the back . They look like fasteners with the tips broken off but the shafts are still in . Anyway I only found 2 tips but I do n't see how these could affect the washer 's operation . <p> I reattached everything to test the washer 's operation myself . Put it on a Normal wash cycle . It washes and the drum spins forward and in reverse . It rinses and the drum spins both directions - it actually went rinsed and drained 3 times . On the Final Spin I can hear the motor going but it does n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions very slowly ( probably for loosening the clothes from the drum ) and then stops . All the lights turn off , followed by 3 beeps . The 3 beeps repeat after a pause interval . According to the error code in the manual , 3 beeps = Drum overfilled - inlet valve pressure switch or control board failure . The clothes in the drum were obviously still very wet but the tub was drained of water . I also did a quick test of the Drain/Spin cycle with the same result . I was all prepared to get a new control board but looked online for a similar problem and found this forum . Then I found the repair manual PDF from Jake and tried the diagnostic test on page 10 of the PDF ( mine is a " Good " model ) . So I got into diagnostic mode and rotated the switch 8 clicks from the Start position to check the High Spin . The High Spin works ! So my conclusion is that the problem is not on the control board but may have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm that my conclusion is in the right direction ? And if so , what part do I need and how do I go about replacing it ? <p> Sorry for the long post , but I would n't describe myself as mechanically inclined and I still like to try fixing things myself . So I need to be very clear about the steps I took diagnose the problem . <p> Jake we are experiencing the exact same issue as Whimsical as was wondering if you could help out . I see there wa no follow up from Whimsical so I 'm stumped as to if its the control board or door switch . So far I have run the Diagnostics Test , checked each of the 9 clicks and they all check out . The error code came up as E43 . I followed the advice above and checked the door switch and it read 1550 ohms . I stumped as the Diagnostic Test was good and the switch is good . So what 's with the E43 code ? I 'm hoping to replace the right part the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that I read on another thread that returns are possible for a full refund with the exception of the shipping charge , is that correct ? If so then I may order the door switch to play it safe as we are without a washer right now . Are parts shipped to Canada from the US or do you have a parts depot in Canada they ship from ?

Is the wide swing on temps a constant thing ? In other words , does the freezer go from 0 to 35 to 0 to 35 , etc etc or is this an intermittent problem ? <p> I found a good page that describes how the defrost cycle works : Appliance411 FAQ : How does a Frost Free Refrigerator 's Defrost System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My thermometer was showing around 45F at that point , but the thermostat was showing 0 Ohms . While I was holding it , I heard it click and it went to an open circuit .

Thanks for the help , Josh <p> What you just described was correct normal operation for the defrost thermostat . The defrost thermostat is designed to remain closed under 50 degrees and open above 50 degrees . Those thermostats do n't get " sticky " points because they 're not constantly opening and closing . That refrigerator is designed to remain in defrost during the defrost cycle , approximately 18 minutes and the defrost thermostat should remain closed the entire time . The temperatures in the freezer will climb 20 degrees but for such a short period of time it 's not noticeable . <p> I guess I jumped the gun on that one . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and put the new thermostat in just to eliminate that being a possibility . Around an hour or so later , I caught it in the defrost cycle .

The night I checked the defrost thermostat and then again tonight when I replaced it , I noticed frost build up at the top of the evaporator coils , but none at the bottom . The frost also covered the thermostat . Both of these times would have been toward the end of a normal cooling cycle , within an hour or two of the defrost cycle starting .

Thanks , Josh <p> You had your temperature probe behind the evaporator cover where the heater is . It gets pretty warm in that space but it does n't transfer to the freezer section during normal operation . We do n't care about any temperatures other than somewhere around the middle of both the refrigerator and freezer section . The defrost system sounds like it 's working like it 's suppose to . You 've cleaned the coils and checked the fans . Let 's get back to the frost pattern on the evaporator .

Common problems with a sealed system are bad compressors , refrigerant leaks , and system restrictions . Sealed system repairs should be done only by a qualified refrigeration technician certified for type 1 and 2 refrigerants . <p> I had a service person come look at the refrigerator .

I think it is but I 'll check ) or something elsewhere in the fridge . <p> I do see the motor turn on the icemaker when I jump it , and I have actually seen it properly fill with water ( so the water valve is working ) <p> Where does this wire from the optics board go , and what do I do next ? I believe it goes to the front touch panel , but do n't know how to remove that panel .

I think it was when I did the second part of the test ( first part = blink/blink/pause , second part=hold down flap so optics pointing at each other and see solid red light ) . I saw the solid red light , then shut the freezer and it would n't make ice . Seems weird that it worked that one time .

I have a Kenmore Series 70 electric dryer that dries sporadically . All the vent lines are excellent and clear . The exhaust area and everything behind the rear panel is extremely clean , no blockages . It always tumbles . All the timers advance well . It will always heat . Sometimes it will take much longer to initially heat-up then others using the same setting . It almost seems like the heating element is cycling way too much at times . When it takes longer to heat-up , it will take nearly two 60 minute cycles to dry . Other times , it will work flawlessly . I checked all posts in the forum that I could find on the subject . I checked everything that I was encouraged to check . Using a multi-meter , I checked the thermal fuse ( even though it can not be the thermal fuse if the dryer works , from what I understand ? ) . The continuity checks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycling thermostat . The continuity checked out fine . The resistance of the other two connections was right at 6.9 thousand ohms . I proceeded to the heating element itself . It checked out at 9 ohms . The high-limit thermostat checks out fine for continuity . I then checked the high-limit cut-off which also tested fine . I checked the plug for 240 and that is fine . Am I missing something ? Any other suggestions on what it could be ? Anything else that I could test ? Any help would be greatly appreciated ! Kind regards . <p> Ok , did you pull the dryer out from the wall and remove the vent exhaust hose completely from your dryer ? Then dry a load ? If not do that first , you 'd be surprised how many times in my 20 years I 've done this when I went out to a customers house with this same issue . <p> Open some windows if your dryer is in your house or laundry room to let the hot air escape . <p> I 'd also check for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blower wheel housing in the back of your dryer . <p> On your model you have to take your back access panel off and then the lint duct assembly that goes to your blower wheel housing . <p> Thanks for the quick reply Jake ! I pulled the dryer from the wall and tried it several times with the same result . I even removed the vent exhaust and tried it again , several times . At times it worked great , other times it did not . I also disassembled the back of the dryer . I removed and checked the filter housing duct and blower wheel area . The entire duct and blower wheel were extremely clean with very , very little lint . The heating element duct was very , very clean also . I tried it again with the same result ? Anything else I should try or look into ? <p> It is me once again . Thank you for the advice . Before I call a Sears Tech , I would like to run another scenario by you . I have been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I decided to try the same size loads on the Med-Perm-Press setting . I have run 5 of the same size loads thus far . Every one dried perfectly . Does this make any sense ? When I use the High Heat setting , it works sporadically . When I use the Medium Heat setting , it works flawlessly . Same size and type loads . Can you think of any reason why this would happen ? As long as it continues to work well , I am fine with using the Medium setting . But if this is a sign of a problem , I would like to repair it . Thank you again ! <p> Hello . Me again ! I just switched the items out . It seems to consistently not dry well now for some reason ? It is no longer sporadic , which is good . A definite step in the right direction . So , after reading numerous other threads , I decided to get more " technical " and actually measure the temperature during the cycles of the cotton " HIGH " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this to see when the heating element would shut down after initial start-up and when it would cycle on again . This is what I found . I pulled the dryer from the wall . Disconnected the exterior exhaust hose . I set a meat thermometer solidly into the dryer exhaust . I turned the setting to delicate " LOW " setting . The element started heating quickly . Soon the temperature came up to 140 degrees before the heating element kicked off . I watched the thermometer drop . Then drop more . Then drop more . The thermometer starts at 110 degrees and the heating element did not kick on until below that . How far , I do not know . Then I decided to let it cool down for a half-hour or so . Then I tried the test again . This time on the cotton " HIGH " setting . This time the heating element quickly came up to 160 degrees . Then the heating element kicked off . I again watched the thermometer closely to see when the heating element would kick back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature fell to 125 degrees . Is the 35 degree drop typical ? Is this indicative of another problem ? This may be why it is taking so long to dry , because the range of going from 160 to 125 is too much ? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated . It seems to work fantastic otherwise . Thank you again !

We have a Whirlpool Gold Oven/Microwave combo unit Model GMC305PDS07 . It 's around 5 years old . The oven still works fine , but recently the microwave stopped working . It still allows you to enter cook time , but when you push start , it just displays an error that says " Door " . The latches and switches seem fine and I already reset the circuit breaker to rule out some funky reset issue . Any thoughts ? <p> The door error is most likely caused by an open buss fuse WPW10017410 located behind the control panel . <p> If you look at the circuit , both the buss and monitor fuse are in series with the interlock circuit . Turn off the power to the unit , removed the two side trim pieces and the panel screws will be on the bottom on each side . Lift up the panel and the buss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the fuse you 're referring to is the very large fuse just to the right as you lift the control panel up . If so , it 's testing good ( short ) . Another interesting thing that may help diagnose is that I noticed one time ( by accident ) that if you opened the microwave door during operation , it did not turn off . I always wondered about that , seemed like the switch was n't signaling properly . I 'm pretty sure that it 's a bad idea to allow the microwave to continue operating after the door is open . <p> Anyway , I 'm pretty sure the switches are beyond my technical ability to access and even if I diagnose them as the issue , I would n't know where to get parts . Any tips to find a reputable Whirlpool tech in the North Atlanta burbs ? <p> That is probably a good choice as the switches and the second fuse are located within the microave cabinet and take some work to get to . Based on the microwave still running with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of adjustment or begining to fail . Do n't worry about being exposed to anything harmful because the magnetron can not function with the door open . What you are seeing is the fan , turntable and lights working , but not the magnetron . <p> As for looking for a reputable service provider , you can check Whirlpools website for their prefered service network , or I suggest places like Angies list , Yelp , or Google , read some reviews and call and talk to them . If they do n't make you feel comfortable and confident , move on to someone else . <p> Brian/Brett , wanted to follow-up to hopefully help others with this same issue . <p> I finally had someone come out to fix this and sure enough , it turned out to be the second interior fuseWP4375321 ( not the main buss fuse ) . <p> It took 2 Guys nearly 2 hours to diagnose/replace due to the work involved with disassembly/reassembly . In the end they charged me $160 total , which I thought was fair for 2 hours of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these combo units were not designed with ease of service in mind ! <p> gipper , I 'm having the same problem .

It was upstream from the valve , so would not leak when you just look at it , or if the water were not hooked up . <p> The noise of the water dispensing up front masked the noise of the water spraying in the back . <p> I saw 2 of these last week ...

My issue is you set the oven temp to say 400 deg. wait about 20min ( always has taken long time to warmup ) then if you set the timer or do n't set the timer , you bake and check the oven temp by turning off ( clear ) the oven and hitting bake again and setting 400 deg , , you will find it has dropped it drops about 20 deg in say 5 min .. With or without the timer set on .. the only way you realize this is your baking goods are not baked or you turn off and back on as I said .. to get the true temp .. the oven temp will go back up once re started .. What could this be . Its not even a year old .. maybe 6 months .. ? I hate to haul it in for repairs already if i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this : When you select a temperature and push start , the element turns on and heats up the oven usually past the temperature you have set . The it turns the element off and the temperature will fall to a preset temperature and then repeat the process . When I use a meter to check temperatures it gives me a constant read out so If I set the temperature on the range to 350*F , my meter might show the temperature reached 390*F before it turned off and the temperature might fall to 340*F before it turns back on . Next time it might have reached 370*F and turned off and 345*F back on . Eventually it will even out close to the set temperature but most of these ranges are n't good enough to maintain a constant temperature because there are temperature variations even inside the oven . The temp will be hotter close to the element than the center of the range . Check the oven sensor in your range . Use a meter that can read ohms .

It was fine , and then a small plastic lid accidentally fell on the heating element . It came off easily ( it was n't really stuck very much ) , but nonetheless , I scrubbed the crap out of the heating element to remove any residue . I did this while the heating cool was cool , and again after running the dishwasher when the coil was hot . We have run the dishwasher at least 10 times since then , and the nasty burnt plastic smell will not go away . I followed all the tips I found online ( e.g. , scrubbed the entire inside with vinegar ; poured baking soda in the bottom and ran the washer , and another time ran it with a bowl of vinegar at the bottom ) , and nothing has worked . The smell is slightly less ( but not by much ) than the time the plastic actually burned , but since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dishwasher WITHOUT the heated dry option or with it on . This suggests to me there may be something else going on that coincidentally occurred around the time of this plastic melting . However , this seems unlikely since this is a brand new dishwasher and I do n't see any internal parts that are melted . Any help would be appreciated ! <p> The burned plastic smell will permeate anything plastic inside the dishwasher . Mostly in the vent assembly but hoses , housings , and spray arms will retain the smell . It can also get into any insulation in the door or even the sound blanket because the vent was probably blowing the burned plastic through the space between the two doors . Eventually it will go away with use . I could n't tell you how long that might take . If your tub is stainless steel there 's not much you can do . The smell is not coming from the metal heating element but the heat from the element will amplify the smell inside the machine . <p> Thanks . Jeff , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of those techniques worked . Rick , I 'm hoping it will go away with time ; I was just concerned it was something else since most people got it to go away in a few washes after scrubbing away the plastic residue . I will wait it out and hope for the best . It just makes all of our dishes smell also , and the concept of eating off of dishes that smell like plastic is not too appetizing ...

The motor may not be spinning in the direction that the motor is supposed to for agitate .

If you look at the pic in the link below , you can see the part I cut out and can see the perfectly round groove the pulley cut into the shroud . The bolt holding the pulley seemed tight , but I did notice that there was some play on the shaft ( i.e. I could push the pulley in and out maybe 1/4 " .

FYI my " fix " was shortlived . After I tightened the bolt it worked for a few blissful washes but then started making noises again .

PS - the owners manual sucks , it says either ( a ) I blew a fuse , or ( b ) I do n't know how operate the oven . Thanks <p> Did you check your dual breakers first at your home 's breaker box ? I 'd definity check that first , reset the dual breakers ( FLIP BOTH OFF THEN ON AGAIN ) even if one does n't look tripped . Your oven works on 240 volts , so if one of the dual breakers is tripped the microwave could still work fine , as that only requires 120 volts to operate . <p> You 'll need to pull your oven out from the wall , then take off the back access panel , then you will need a volt/ohm meter , then take off the wires to it , and ohm it for continuity .

I took off the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to zero , which tells me it is fine . Both heating elements go to zero as well .

I understand from some of the other threads here that one of the fuses might be blown . Does anyone have the service manual for this model microwave that shows the fuse locations ? <p> Also , I have a continuity detector , so I can test the fuses . If the microwave is unplugged , is it safe to simply pop out the fuse to test it ? <p> Thank you for any help . <p> Update : I found some Youtube videos on microwave repair that used a Whirlpool over the range that looks exactly like mine . From what I gathered , if a fuse has blown , something else is wrong . I believe I need to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have blown the fuse that 's located above the control panel , so I should check that too . Then order a replacement door switch and fuse . <p> It seems simple enough to access these parts . The only step that makes me nervous is discharging the capacitor that 's located above the control panel . I 'll have to get an insulated screwdriver for this . Does anyone have any other tips or recommendations for this step ? <p> The fuse is OK . The problem is one of the door switches . There 's two in the lower switch holder and one in the upper switch holder . Unplug the microwave . Remove the control panel . Use a long screwdriver ( any screwdriver will work as long as the handle is not metal ) and touch the end to a terminal on the HV capacitor and touch the shaft of the screwdriver to the frame anywhere . If you have n't been able to use the microwave for the last 24 hours there 's no voltage in the capacitor . Disconnect at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for continuity by opening and closing the door . The one on top should show continuity with the door closed and no continuity when the door is open . The one on the bottom with three wires is most likely the bad one . The one on the bottom with two wires is good . If it was bad the microwave would be dead , no beeps or " door " in the display . <p> Thank you so much for the advice . My microwave has two switches in the upper switch holder and one switch in the bottom holder . I had to remove the top holder from the microwave , because the switch with the three connectors was facing toward the microwave wall and I could not see it or get to it . <p> Once I got the switches out I could see how they were marked and how the plastic holder works to depress the actuator on the switch when the door is closed . <p> I tested all three switches for continuity and they tested ok . I had the thought that maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was closed . So I reinstalled the top holder and was able to test for continuity with the help of a flash light and small mirror . Both top switches tested ok with the door open and closed . <p> I put the microwave back together and now it works fine . Do you think its possible something is wrong with the controller board and it sort of rebooted since its been unplugged for a week ? <p> I noticed the tolerance on the plastic holder for depressing the actuator on the switches is very small , could the plastic holder have started missing its mark and since I moved them around they are ok now ? <p> ..... could the plastic holder have started missing its mark and since I moved them around they are ok now ? <p> Yes .

One of two possibilities exist for my situation , if the unit detects one of these syptoms in 3 consecutive cycles it will go into ' Limp Mode ' ( clean light flashing 7 times , etc ... ) , 1 , the heating element could be bad , and when it heats , if the unit does not detect a specified change in temperature the unit goes into limp mode , and 2 , if the door is not closed completely and the dishwasher discovers this , again it will go into limp mode .

I just ran the second load since replacing the drain pump and now I have the same ' Not Draining Message ' again . I 'm thinking maybe there is an air-lock/siphoning issue instead . Thinking back to how this problem started ... after the first time I got the error message I tried draining it manually but no water would come out of the tube .

I 'm thinking I should pull that junction apart and see if there is a clog . Any suggestions on where to look for a siphoning problem other than that fitting ? <p> Thank you Jeff I 'll check those parts first .

The main problems are usually : stuck wash motor ; leaking wash motor ; control board heater relay solder failure ( re-solder ) ; NTC failure ; heater water flow pressure switch failure ; fills and surges- drain and fills continuously , due to diaphram blockage ; dispensor issues ; and a few others . <p> The time of the display varies due to operational conditions . It will go up or down dependant upon things like incoming water temp , how clean dish water is , etc ... <p> I would suspect the drain pump- due to it being the last and first thing run during cycles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the washer to begin a cycle : no run drain pump usually means no water will fill . The drain pump is way cheaper than the wash motor and much easier to change . You can get into sump area , uncover drain pump impellers on the left-torx screw I believe or a tab , about 9 o'clock , and check for glass ( glass is clear- be smart ) or junk under/around plastic blades , and also " flick " blades with your finger- the blades should " lump " around on rotation , not spin freely like fan . Drain pump can be replaced thru front panel but : TURN OFF POWER BEFORE PLAYING ! Good luck . <h> Bosch SHU43C 05UC /17 <p> thanks ivoid. you 're dead right . I checked the drain entry .. no blockage , no dirt and the fan spun as you said ... all very clean . we ran it and it stopped after 3 minutes ( which my wife said its been doing for a few weeks now ) , so we opened up and saw a good build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest point mesh grate .. so I pulled off the mesh and lifted the basket out and it drained , gradually but not completely , and when I closed it the cycle took up where it left off .... I guess this suggests , as you said , the drain is the culprit , no ? motor lost some power ? there was no great chunk of anything in either the top mesh or the basket .. <p> further observation . when the program is finished , there is always water left in the sump area a good inch or two deep at the bottom of the sump ... what might this mean ? is it that the drain pump is working but not its full cycle ? , or perhaps there 's blockage beyond the accessible area ? ( seems unlikely though , considering all the filters .. can it be hard water detritus creating back pressure that stops the last couple of inches ? ) .... <p> Unrelated to the problem ( I think ) ... there 's always moisture on everything when we open the machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little water left in the sump or is it that there 's no dry cycle and moist hot air condenses ? <p> if I am to eventually replace the drain pump , you refer to the front panel ... by that do you mean I remove the panel of stainless steel on the inside of the door and get at it that way ? or is the pump underneath so the panel is at the front facing out at floor level ? would that mean the whole machine needs to be " jacked up " .. to allow space to work ? ( its a built in unit ... not sure how I 'd do that ) . <p> Do this : disconnect the drain line under the sink and run it into a bucket . Also , said drain line should have a " high loop " before connected to drain= important , and many are incorrectly installed without the high loop . So , with drain line in bucket , initiate cycle and drain pumps out . To replace drain pump you need to remove the toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As for " wet " inside- I would suspect the real problem is the heater relay contact . It probably has " un-soldered " itself . The water gets real hot on last rinse and the residual heat dries the dishes- when the heater does n't  work , you get forever programs and not finishing cycles , water in bottom or does n't dry dishes . Easy to resolder the board with a low temp soldering iron . You will melt the board if not low temp . Clean up contact area and resolder it . I would suspect this is your real issue . To check heater relay- you need to remove the front ss panel , the control panel , and carefully release the control board from steel frame , open up plastic cover and flip main board over to see the melted solder contact . Turn off the power before playing .... <p> I think there is posts on how to fix circuit board heater relay issue . Good luck . Can buy a new board , but usually they are repairable if only needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your quick response . and you 're right , no high loop ( it actually has a low loop ... droops down low in a big loop and back up to its join with the kitchen sink drain pipe ) . fixed that with a high screw and a hook to hang it from . <p> What am I trying to get done by taking the drain line off and running a cycle into a bucket ( happy to do it ) .. just wondering what that will establish ? <p> Also , I 'm a little confused . Do you think I need a new drain pump ? Do you think the drain pump is not working properly on account of residual water in the sump , and I should necessarily replace it ? Or were you just answering my question about how to get at it ? <p> Thanks for the info and advice on the heat relay .. I did see some pictures done on macro about that so I 'll get at it . Makes sense . <p> Shorter version sorry- Checking drain line into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections . If yours goes directly to disposal or plumbing= nevermind . <p> Residual water pools in sump due to no high loop . <p> First- run the dishwasher on normal cycle , making sure the rinse agent dispensor is full . When it is finished washing and starts drying- pop the door open and check for steam escaping . NO steam equals no heat , equals long program runs with poor drying . <p> hi ivoid .. long time since i checked in about my Bosch problems per thread above .. had to go down under to attend to some family issues . so back on deck now , never got at the solder in the heat relay contact .. whenever a cycle runs , if we open the door shortly afterwards , we 're hit by a wall of steam , so no lack of heat being generated . <p> Current problem is that the machine has no power .. its been three days now and no light ever appears on the on/off switch .. dead in the water so to speak . Our problem back in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can read the thread above .. lemme know if not and I can cut and paste ) was that of the machine simply refusing to start on occassion , but with the passing of time it would always somehow get its act together and run . So we 're clueless as to what to do less . Checked the cicuit breaker a number of times . ALl other electrical things are running fine . Checked the sump ; couple of inches of water in it but no blockage . Tried the test sequence but with no power when I push on/off , nada . I noticed the drain tube loop was looping low ( fell off the hook I installed ) .. Any ideas ?

This happens even when nothing is cooking on the stove and the kitchen/stove top are cool . Most recently this happend when the microwave cycle ends and you open the microwave door , or if you interrupt the cycle by opening the door . When you press the vent fan button , the system thinks you are turning fan ON , but the fan speed drops to low . Cycling the button between off-high-low simply cycles the fan between high and low . Any ideas ? <p> A couple things come to mind , but could you double check your model number as the one listed is does not appear to be valid . Also , does the fan turn on at random times or does it always occur when you are using some other function ? And once the fan turns on , can you turn it back off with the button or does it only go to low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we can do to assist . <p> Thanks for the reply . How is this for a model number : JNM1541DMWW . It is a GE over the range . The best way to describe it would be semi-random . The fan will turn on occassionally when opening the door or whenever the heat cycle has ended or if you interrupt a heat cycle by opening the door . It is not at the point where it happens everytime , only occassionally . I 've never seen the fan turn on without somebody at least touching the microwave . The only way to get it to turn off is to the unplug it/cycle the breaker . When the fan does get stuck on , it always starts at HIGH . I 'll hit the vent fan button , the led display will read FAN HIGH , and the fan will actually will low . I 'll hit the button again , display read LOW and fan will actually be high . Striking button a 3rd time , display read OFF , but the fan will once again be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycling power is about 5 minutes . Most of these cases there is nothing cooking on the stove . <p> Based on what you are describing , looks like the smart board is turning the fan on without any user input . This could be caused by a loose connection from the user interface , or possibly a cold solder joint on the board . My suggestion would be to remove the control panel and verify all the connections are good , and remove the ribbon cable from the board and clean the contacts with a pencil eraser prior to reinstalling it . Of course ensure the power has been removed before doing all that . Then see if that makes a difference . If that does n't work , then you are looking most likely looking at a new smart board as that is where all the magic happens . Let us know what happens . <p> Remove the two screws along the top ends that hold the vent grill to the cabinet .

Until today , it seemed to spin lighter loads well , clothes/items came out damp but not soggy like heavier loads did . Today , the washer stopped spinning all together . The motor runs and sounds like it is trying to spin , but the tub does not move . Not sure if it 's moving during other portions of the cycle , as I do n't want to start a cycle and not have it drain the water out , and be stuck with a washer full of water ... help ! what is causing washer not to spin ? would it be more economical to purchase a new washer , as my husband thinks ? this washer is only 5 years old . <p> Well I replaced the motor couplers and now the washer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash we ran came out well extracted , but the following 2 loads we ran were progressively more wet after the cycle .

It is progressing thru all the parts of the cycle properly , and seems to be spinning well now with it 's new motor couplers ! ... really whizzing ! But at the end of the spin cycles there is a ' slushing ' sound of water remaining in the outer tub , like it 's not getting pumped out . Not sure if this is normal since I never paid attention to that before . And the water is n't being extracted from the clothes very well ( still ) . <p> Based on this new information , do you still think it 's the basket drive/clutch assembly ? Or could there be a problem with the pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' clog ' cause the machine not to extract water from clothes well ?

We could n't get the hose that comes off the back of the machine to the sewer drain stand pipe to check that one , but the rest were clear . Thoughts ? <p> Yes , it could be either something semi-clogging the drain pump or the pump itself wearing out . <p> What I always do is time the drain water extraction , and watch the water drain out from the drain hose into your drain stand , it should drain out all the water in the tub within 90 seconds , if it does n't then I 'd take the pump off and check for something clogged in it , or cracked/broken impellers in the pump . <p> here 's some more info ... i timed the pump draining the water , and it got it all out within 90 seconds ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way less than 90 for small load ) . the rest of the cycle seemed fine , UNTIL it got to the extra rinse ... the basket filled and agitated . then it pumped the water out , but the basket did n't spin , the water continued to drain . the machine then started to spray water on the clothes for the ' ultra rinse ' but the basket , which should spin during this portion , started to move then stopped . after a few seconds , i reached in and turned the agitator , and the basket started and continued to spin during the rest of the cycle ; however , it did n't seem to spin nearly as fast as it should have , and the clothes inside were still quite wet . i then switched the machine to the ' normal ' wash cycle 's final spin and it spun very fast and got all the water out of the clothes ; they were just damp . so it seems that the problem is in the extra spin cycle ... does this sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested before ) . and will this soon become a problem in the ' normal ' wash cycle too ..... should i start looking for a new washer ? <p> do you think washing machines are not built to last very long anymore ? should i look for a less expensive one , expecting it not to last more than 5 years ? i was considering the new Amana front-loader ( NFW7200T ) or the Whirlpool Duet HT ( WFW9400S ) .

The door may be opened . <p> I started taking the washer apart and after removing the bottom front panel found a Service Technician manual . The manual describes how to access the self diagnostics . I removed the door latch/switch assy and determined the connector for the door switch wiggles enough to not make connection thus making it seem the door is not closed ( 3 dings ) when selecting START . There are 3 connectors on the latch assy and the door closed circuit uses a cheap circuit board edge connector . The other 2 use spade connectors for the latch solenoids . After talking with the rest of the family there have been times when the machine would not start ( 3 dings ) and opening/closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I replaced the connector with wires and it is working fine . <p> To remove the latch assy you 'll need a 1/4 " nut driver for the panel screws and a T-20 Torx driver for the latch assy screws . I removed the top ( 3 screws on rear ) , the bottom front panel ( 3 more screws ) and the 2 latch assy screws . After fishing the harness out of the guide tray the latch assy can be set on top of the washer . After removing all the connectors , I cut off the blue wires connector and soldered 2 ft extension wires from the blue wires to the contacts on the door latch switch circuit board . ( The door latch assy uses a spring loaded plunger to move an arm on a tiny switch mounted on the circuit board . ) One could replace the switch entirely by drilling a hole in the door frame a few inches above the latch assy and install a good quality switch .

Both heating elements stopped working at the same time . Cook top works fine . Tried replacing control board first thinking this was the problem , but it did n't fix it . Would a bad thermostat keep it from heating ? The fan comes on just like normal when I cut the oven on . I searched for a fuse to reset , but was told that my model did n't have a fuse .

@@35343944 @4343944/ 166558 @qwx366558 <p> A few weeks back , we ran it through a typical cycle ( quick wash/no heated dry ) . Several hours later I heard a faint beeping noise . I traced the beeps to the dishwasher and noticed it was not running but the heated dry light was on . I opened the door and sure enough , lots of heat came out . I think I hit cancel and the heated dry light came back on right away . Cancel again , heated dry light returned . All the while intermittent beeps ... no pattern at all . Finally I unplugged it and plugged it back in . This seemed to do the trick until the next time we went to use it . It finished the cycle , more beeps , forced itself to heated dry . The next time we used it , it finished it 's cycle fine but completely died . Unplugging it did n't  do anything . Hitting combinations of control buttons did n't  do anything . No reaction at all from the control panel . <p> So I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control board inside ( not the panel with the buttons ) . I decided to purchase a new main control unit and installed it . Everything worked fine on it 's first cycle . The second cycle , the beeping started again . I pressed cancel and the quick wash button chimed and lit up and more intermittent beeps . Right now , it 's sitting unplugged . <p> Our dishes are typically very clean going into the washer as we basically rinse off all food so this is the reason we run quickwash cycles . Also , the heated dry option seemed to make our dishes stink and we live in Arizona ( where everything is hot and dry already ) so we rarely ran it with that option . When we did run on normal cycle , it always ran for hours ... 2 or more ( not sure if that is normal ) . <p> A Field Service Test may be started by pressing the HEATED DRY key 6 times followed by the START key within 8 seconds .

To the cancel test , press the START/CANCEL keypad . The control has been designed to test the Sensor Memory and Motor . A Memory/ Software check will occur immediately after the test is started .

One of those items would usually fix it for a few days but it eventually quit responding at all to any of our temp fixes . I got lots of practice and could have the door apart and back together in less than 5 minutes . <p> Because replacing this POS dishwasher would require some extensive effort , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on it . I bought a new control panel last year . part # WPW10475780 It did the trick ... washer has been working as expected since that time . Quick and easy fix but requires torx bits to get the door apart . <p> The design of the dishwasher is flawed . Over time , steam affects/degrades the electrical connections of the control panel . Just google : maytag control panel dishwasher ... and see for yourself .

Once I replaced the control panel board , the dishwasher worked fine for 2-3 weeks , then stopped working . It turned out to be thermal fuse this time .

I 've been looking over the tech sheet ; that 's where I found out how to " normalize " the brains in this thing . Normalization was the first thing I tried , by the way . <p> In the meantime , I had to epoxy all of the screw towers that hold the control panel to the front door ; all were broken . I do n't know why as we purchased this machine in ' 06 and it has seen light service in a two-person household since . Once the epoxy has cured for 24 hours , I 'll run a cycle and see what happens . <p> Hi Jake -- I can supply a detailed log , but bottom line : there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element when the " clean " light came on . It took two presses of the " Drain/Cancel " bottom to clear the tub of all visible water . <p> I selected a " Light wash , heated dry " . <p> At various points during the wash ( and , I assume rinse ) cycles , there were pauses of usually 10-15 seconds and sounds of water being circulated and sometimes drained for some seconds during the wash and rinse cycles . The appropriate spraying/sloshing sounds were made during wash or , I assume , rinse . At no time during either wash or rinse was there any sound of water being drained for long enough to clear the tub . Any time I opened the door to check during these cycles , there was water in the tub to about the bottom of the heating element . <p> After about 1 hour and 43 minutes , the " Dry " LED lit . At that point , there was about 1/2 " of water in the tub . <p> The " Dry " cycle lasted about 25 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1/2 " water in the tub . <p> I pressed the " Drain/Cancel " button . After that cycle ended , there remained about half the original level of water in the tub . A second press cleared the tub . <p> What I do n't understand is how is so much water getting into the dishwasher ? Even when it does n't drain during and after the main wash cycles you should n't be getting all that water in there . Have you done anything to change the routing of the drain hose under the sink that maybe water from the sink is siphoning back into the dishwasher ? <p> For the not draining issue during and after the main wash cycles the problem sounds like the control board , that control board is the brain and tells the drain motor to start and drain .

Does it just need some grease . <p> The cabrio has a shaft that runs between the wash plate and the rotor located under the washer . The usual cause for noise during spin is something that has made it 's way between the spin basket and tub . But it 's best to try and determine if the noise is from under the washer or inside the washer , that way you are n't randomly taking things apart . See if you can pin point the location of the noise , and include the model number as there are two versions of the Cabrio . <p> I am a Sear 's tech and it is the bearing more than likely , I also own a cabrio myself . Is it a loud , constant roar when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W10193886 tub itself , comes with the bearing . Pretty time consuming job , but I 've done several . The tub might have a 10 yr warr , ck owners manuel . <p> This has just started happening to my Cabrio , Model WTW6600SW2 SN CW0571434 . It was purchased from Sears 2/15/08 for $850 ( $1000 with delivery/takeaway/tax , with no extended warranty ) . Is the tub/bearing something I could fix myself with standard tools ? I 've made washer repairs in the past ( quite a few years back though ) . If so how much is the part ? And where do I get the manual ? What would a typical cost be if I had a repairman do it ? How common is the problem and what are the odds of a subsequent failure within 12 years ? <h> Noise from Cabrio during spin <p> My noise is coming from under the machine during spin with a load a constant loud roar . I placed it on its back because the bottom is open and I removed the motor rotor which had grease splater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from the bearing on the shaft also found two small cracks in rotor on oppisite sides . My question is can I just replace the bearing or do I have to replace the tub to change the bad bearing .

It was getting worse by the load . 6 months after the warranty ran out . <p> The problem was that the main shaft seal under the impeller leaked and the top and bottom bearings were rusting &amp; corroding . The main shaft also rusted and seized against the main shaft . <p> The standard fix is replace the tub - which has the shaft , seal and both bearings attached . This is $$$$ and $250+ + labour , shipping taxes , time , etc . And this may not fix the fatal flaw that , Steel + water- rust &amp; corrosion . <p> As a retired guy - I ca n't afford this ! <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to fix this . I think I have . <p> I replaced the bearings with stainless steel ones , re-processed my rusty ( black oxide coated ) main shaft with Zinc phosphate coating ( By a pro coating shop. ) , cleaned the drain hole in the top bearing chamber and re-assembled with top quality wheel bearing grease . <p> After 2 months and 50+ loads later , no leaks and low noise . Fingers are crossed . Total cost about $50 . ( Coating shop was free- run by a female who understood my wife 's problem . Thank god . ) <p> Whirlpool should sell the seals , bearings and shaft . Because shipping the whole tub is very $$$ and unnecessary . Under warranty , it is OK for the service guy to replace modules - rather than fix them . But after warranty , a lot of DIY 's fix their own stuff and tub is too $$$ . <p> I have the same issue with my kenmore apt size washer ( 110.297 ) ( loud whirring and grease splatter ) and am trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum ( value of $350 according Sears Canada ) is covered by a lifetime warranty .

What 's happening is the air is n't circulating through both sections . The capillary for both thermostats is located at the top of the fresh food section and since the air from the freezer ca n't get to them it 's causing the compressor to continuously run .

Thank you for the suggestion . <p> Hi Randy , I want to make sure I 'm following you and that we 're on the same page first . The transmission in your machine is called a neutral drain transmission . During normal operation when you first start the machine on a regular wash cycle , it fills and then starts to agitate . At the end of agitate part of the wash cycle , the motor reverses direction and immediately starts to pump out the water for a timer set amount of time . The timer then pauses the motor for 3-5 seconds . At the end of that pause the motor starts and the machine goes into spin cycle . <p> On your machine , since the timer is new I 'll assume there 's a 3-5 second pause after draining the water and when the motor starts up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lid or push the timer knob in to stop the machine for several seconds , then lower the lid or pull the timer knob out to restart the machine it will spin normally . Good so far ? <p> After you lower the lid and it 's in a spin cycle , let it continue on it 's own and see if it will fill again and agitate normally , then pump the water out . <p> Yes good so far . It does fill again and agitate normally and then pumps the water out . It will run through the entire cycle regardless if the lid is open and closed or the timer is pushed in ( although I have n't tried pushing the timer in and pulling it out to see if that will make it start spinning without lifting the lid ) . I will try that later and see if that makes a difference . I have to open and close the lid 3 times throughout the entire cycle for it to complete " normally " . The sequence is as follows : <p> Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agitation cycle runs . Motor and transmission both stop . Motor starts and tub begins to drain . Wait about 5 seconds and then open/close lid . Motor and transmission start and runs through spin mode as tub empties . Motor and transmission both stop . Motor and transmission both start . Wait 5 seconds and open and close lid and then it starts to spin . Motor and transmission both stop . Tub fills ( it has hit a mark on the dial that says Rinse ) . Goes into agitation mode . Motor and transmission both stop . Motor and transmission start and pump drains water from tub . Open and close lid to engage spin mode . Tub empties as it is spinning . Motor and transmission both stop . Motor and transmission both start . Open and close lid to engage spin mode . This spin cycle is the final state of the cycle and the rinse comes on twice during the spin cycle before it finishes the entire cycle . <p> When the transmission is running without the tub spinning it makes a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning but it is not " engaged " to turn the tub . It is not a big difference in the sound , but it does sound slightly different . Also , what seems odd to me is that the first time I have to open/close the lid ( during the initial agitation mode ) I hear the clunk where it sounds like something engaged as I open the lid . The other times that I open/close the lid I hear the clunk after the lid is closed . This is a clunk that we 've always heard when the spin mode engages . I do n't believe that it is something new . Not sure if that means anything , but it was an observation that I made . <p> Another observation that I just made is that sometimes it successfully moves to the spin cycle and spins the tub as it should . Most times though I have to open/close the lid to engage the spin cycle . It successfully made the first transition to spin mode the first cycle I ran after installing the new timer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open/close the lid to spin . I just did a load where it successfully engaged the spin mode without lifting the lid on the second spin cycle . The clunking sound was made at the end of the agitation cycle which I believe is the key . My clunking sound is missing most times until I open/close the lid , but not all times . <p> Open the console and disconnect the wire connector from the lid switch . Use a small piece of wire bent in the shape of a " U " and short the two lid switch wires in the connector , temporarily bypassing the lid switch . Do not short anything to the green ( or green/yellow ) ground wire . Start the machine on a regular wash cycle . After the first agitate/wash cycle the motor will reverse directions and pump the water out . Let it continue to drain . After the water is drained from the machine , does the timer pause the motor ( stop the machine ) for 3 - 5 seconds ? Is this where you hear the clunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pause . Does the tub start spinning ? If not , push the timer knob in to stop the machine after five seconds pull the knob out . Does the machine spin now ? If it does spin , push the knob in to stop the machine and advance the timer to the next spin cycle and pull the knob out . Washer should spin . Check all the spins in all the cycles . If the tub starts to spin advance to next spin . No need to run entire spin cycles . <p> I 've run several loads since . First , let me point out that the " slightly different sound " I was referring to is actually the motor running the water pump to drain the tub . I was confusing this . When it IS supposed to be spinning though the sound is slightly different . Also , after running several loads the washer does successfully move to the spin mode immediately following the agitation cycles nearly all times . There is a 2 minute pause after the agitation mode while it drains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin , I am told , because I was stopping the motor and telling the transmission to shift to spin mode . I 'm sure I probably did n't say that correctly and hope you can understand what I am saying . There are two agitation cycles ( I thought there was only one ) and so far it has moved successfully to the spin mode since I 've run these loads . It is the final rinse/spin and spin modes at the end of the wash cycle where it works intermittently . The timer does pause and stop the machine for 3-5 seconds after the water is drained . Yes , this is where I hear the clunk sound . After watching it more closely I am also hearing a " click " that sounds like plastic which I assume is something telling the transmission to shift to spin mode . I also did not realize that pushing/pulling the timer in/out did the same thing as opening/closing the lid . Yes , pushing the timer in/out and opening/closing the lid shifts it into spin cycle . It will resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last update I typically only have to push in/out the timer at the last spin cycle . Now that I know better what to look for ( and to wait for the machine to pause 2 minutes after the agitation mode ) I believe I 've only had to do it for the very last spin cycle . 
@@35343968 @4343968/ 166558 @qwx366558 <h> Crosley washer lid lock and spin problems <p> Hi all , I have a Crosley model CAW9244XQ0 which I understand is a VMW type washing machine by Whirlpool . My problems began when it would not properly drain clothes . I checked the pump and hoses for debris and all is well . After a wash cycle the clothes were dripping wet and not against the sides indicating no proper spin cycle . I checked with an empty tub and the machine is in fact spinning though it sounds like its agitating . <p> The drum turns freely by hand . Now I am having the problem that it does not start at all . I hear the lid lock click several times but never actually lock and the lock light flashes and nothing else . Resistance from blue to white , lid closed is 0.2 ohms ( calls for 0 but I would n't think such a small amount would matter ) and it 's an open circuit with lid open as it should be . <p> Yellow to white is 100 ohms also within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plug fits snuggly . According to the tech sheet that just leaves the control unit . Can anyone more knowledgeable provide ideas ? Thank you . <p> Now this is the basic test for the VMW , models may very a little . Your model just may say HEAVY instead of HEAVY AGITATION . <p> Go into diagnostics and retrieve the codes , and clear them . This is very important since most complaints start with the lid lock on and blinking , or the unit will not start and spin . <p> If , when in diagnostics the codes are F7E1 , F7E5 , or motor speed codes , then chances are it is a motor , capacitor , or shifter related issue . Once the codes are cleared , put the washer into a manual diagnostic test and run the HEAVY AGITATION ; if after 15-20 Seconds the motor runs then you can rule out the motor , capacitor , control , and most likely the wiring harness connections ( although still check the BK wire from the shifter to the control ) . Remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . <p> Next , while in Manual diagnostics , try to get the unit to spin ; if the motor hums for a split second and then shuts down with the lid lock blinking ; go back into diagnostic codes and look for shifter or speed sensor errors . <p> This is proof that the shifter/sensor assembly is the issue because the optical sensor is not reading the motor speed . <p> Thank you for the reply . I have been unable to do any useful testing yet due to the lid switch problem . I installed the new switch today and am not able to get any continuity through the blue and white wires with the lid closed . I 've tried adjusting position of the bezel and tried gently moving the switch by hand but I am only coming up with an open circuit . This is a brand new switch . <p> Update : frustrated with the new switch not working , I jumped pins 2 and 3 to simulate an " always closed " lid . This allowed me to test and confirm that heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual wash cycle , things seem okay until it 's time to spin , then it sits idle and the spin light blinks but it does n't spin . I do n't understand . All functions work in manual test mode but but in a normal cycle . Thank you for the help . <p> When blinking , I can pause and resume and it will spin for several seconds before pausing with the " lid locked " light . It never reaches full speed as the clothes are never pushed against eggs sides and come out very damp . I just went through test #3A of the tech sheet to test the shifter motor , shifter switch , and optical sensor . All check out fine . Voltages are within their appropriate ranges and tachometer verification mode works fine when spun by hand . The tech sheet recommends replacing the main control at this point . Thank you very much for your help .

@@35343970 @4343970/ 166558 @qwx366558 <p> A few weeks ago , we came home from vacation , and I expected things in the fridge to be super cold , and they just were n't . After some reading , I checked the damper door , and it was n't really functioning . It was actually stuck open about a 1/4 of an inch , which allowed for some cooling , but very little . I took it al apart , as I heard that the damper control on my model had an issue where the gear got worn out , but it was n't the case . What I did find was that the ADC was fried . Actually had scorch marks on the board when I took off the case . So I replaced it with this part 5303918476 . After replaced , the door was confirmed working , and things seemed to be ok , until the water line froze in the fridge , as well as almost everything else . Turned the temp control down , that thawed things out , and we were back in business . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Fridge is either too warm or too cold , and I ca n't get it to be consistent . <p> I did have a small amount of frost on the freezer wall , when it was too warm . I triggered a manual defrost cycle and it seemed to get things back under control , super cold again by the next morning . <p> So I am at a loss . I 've been pouring through the posts on here and I know y'all will give me some input , but since I see most of the solutions are to buy that whole kit , but I bought the ADC already . So , fire away , I 'm ready to learn . <p> OK , the ADC you replaced is an update kit . Did you replace the wire harness that came with it ? When the old one shorted out it most likely did damage to one or possibly both cold controls . It very common on that model to have a faulty freezer control and that 's what it sounds like . It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ADC failed . The frost on the back wall is how I could tell . Any longer than a day or so and there may be too much for the new ADC to handle . Remove the evaporator cover and if it looks like a good amount is still on or behind or on the sides of the evaporator , defrost it first with a hair dryer.Temperature Control Thermostat 5304421067 Order now for same day shipping . 365 day return policy . RepairClinic.com <p> Thanks for the reply . I did in fact replace the entire wire harness . Is there a way to tell which if either control is faulty ? I will remove the back of the freezer in a while to check after the kids get to bed . If there is n't a large frost build up , anything else I should look for while I am back there ? <p> The freezer cold control is the one that actually turns the compressor on and off and the refrigerator cold control operates the damper . Now , here 's where it gets a little tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freezer is working fine it 's just the fresh food section that is warm . They get the refrigerator control only to find it did n't fix the problem and here 's why : The normal operating temperature for the fresh food section is 37*F . If the temperature increases 25*F in the fresh food section and you take the milk or a soda out , it 's obvious the temperature is too warm . 62*F is almost room temperature . The normal operating temperature for the freezer is 0*F . If the temperature increases the same 25*F , it 's still almost ten degrees below freezing so everything is still frozen and the ice is n't melting so it appears to be working fine . I need to use my infrared thermometer to get an accurate temperature reading when I have a service call on that same model . When it seems to be too cold or too warm check the position of the damper ( open or closed ) . If it 's too cold and the damper is open , the problem could be the refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it gives you a place to start . <p> Seems like a dumb question , but what if it is too cold and the damper is closed ? Not that that will be an issue , as I just checked it , and the damper is open , and it is cold as the north pole in there . I 've got my hands on an infrared for tomorrow . I am assuming I just shoot the air temp with it right ? <p> Edit : add on : Is the possible reason for the random warmth because of the potential continuous build up of ice on the coil , choking the air flow ? <p> Ok , reporting back : Freezer currently at -6*F , fridge is at 22*F , turned the fridge down to 0 on the control and waited/listened , damper stayed open . Checked visually , and it was in fact still open . Would your verdict be the refrigerator cold control ? <p> OK , It sounds like both cold controls probably need to be replaced . -6*F @ setting 2 is too cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be replaced . Turn the fresh food cold control to it 's lowest setting . Take the capillary out from around the damper and hold the end of it in your hand to warm it . If the damper does n't close , check it for continuity between the two wire terminals on the control . If it reads open , it will need to be replaced also . If the machine was running when the ADC shorted it most likely arched in both controls . I 've seen that happen before . Some of those update kits come with the ADC , wire harness , both controls and the damper assembly . Your model was n't listed as one that uses that kit .

If i then try to set it again it will turn itself off immediately . If I let the unit cool it will then again reheat but do the same thing . I have read about this issue here already and checked the temp sensor which had 1200 ohm resistance and the high limit thermostat also had continuity . I decided to then replace the control unit .

For some reason this just would n't happen , it cranked away just fine .

The beeper sounds and it clunks like someone is turning the cycle knob to another cycle . It briefly flashes a " J " but it appears that , rather than being an error code ( since there are no " J " error codes that I 'm aware of ) , it is simply the edge of an incomplete number . Sometimes it starts back on its own . Other times I have flipped the main electrical switch to restart it . It 's very annoying because my clothes are now half-washed ! Any ideas would be helpful !

I dried a load , medium size . Put in a small load and turned it on . I think it turned on , as I would have noticed it not . <p> About 40 minutes later I went back to check and see if it was done . The dryer was off . So I started to take the clothes out , when I realized they were still wet ( not dripping , but about 75% of what they were when I put them in ) . So I closed the door and turned it back on . But it would n't . <p> Tried several times , and nothing . <p> So , first thing I did was check to make sure the door was closed , then make sure the breaker had n't tripped , it had n't and never has . <p> So , I unplugged it , and looked things over . Took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure all wires were plugged in and snug . All were . Did the same thing for the door switch and most of the wires inside .

I plugged it back in ( assumed that was what you meant ) had someone push the start button and I held the door button while trying to spin the drum counter clockwise , it spun just like I expected it to , but would not start turning on it 's own ( again , assuming you meant the motor to start spinning the drum like normal ) and it would not . <p> So it sounds like it 's the timer ? <p> One other thing that may be helpful .

Looking at pictures and diagrams , I do n't see anything but the belt keeping me from lifting the drum right out of it . <p> And if the motor works , I 'll get the thermal fuse kit first , as that may be it . I was thinking it might be . If a thermal fuse is bad , that would cause the motor not to start at all ? I 'm thinking it would .

I removed the hi limit yesterday , did n't unplug the wires , just removed the screw that holds the bracket on and looked it over . Not outward warning signs . <p> I do think it 's something simple though , as I 've learned from repairing and building a lot of computers , and fixing software problems , that many times , it 's something simple that has gone wrong . It could be the motor , but my gut says it 's not . I am going to clean it thoroughly though . A few years ago I took it apart and cleaned the entire venting system . Made it run a whole lot better . <p> The motor is dead:A test to see if motor is any good , hook up a test cord to terminals 4 &amp; 5 on the motor , plug into a 120 volt outlet to see if the motor will run . If motor runs , the trouble is elsewhere , ( like a possible open door switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still dead with direct power to it , the motor is bad . <p> After reading his 2nd post , saying how he took the thermal fuse off , taped the connectors together then tried it again , I decided to try it as well . What the hell , I thought , I 'll be careful with the fuse in case it 's not it , ca n't hurt to try . <p> Well , it worked . Pressed the start button and it started working just like it should . There were no unusual noises or sounds from anywhere ( only ran it for 5 seconds or so ) . <p> I 'm going to take this opportunity to do a thorough cleaning of entire machine , except taking the drum out , do n't want to do that if I do n't have to . <p> I 'll update as to what happens , but all indications are you were very correct in stating it might be the thermal fuse . It 's usually something small or simple . That little part caused it to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confirmed it was the correct man part # LA-1053 . <p> It 's back together and working smoothly again . I cleaned it as well as I could without taking the drum out . Used a shop vac , put the hose in and bent a little so I could suck as much loose lint/dust as I could from around the motor . <p> Everything else cleaned up well too . Was n't a hard job at all . You should keep that little test in mind for people who have mechanical ability , but do n't know exactly what to try or test . Helped me a bunch . Since the thermal fuse is essentially a switch .

I followed threads on this forum and understand that these error messages relate to either a communication problem between the CCU and the MCU ( motor ? ) or my motor is just shot . I ran the " quick diagnostic " as described in the service tech manual found on the back panel , but the diagnostic does not complete the first test phase . It 's supposed to check the door lock - that works ok - and check functionality of the drain pump . That second operation does not take place . After about 5 or 10 minutes of trying , the diagnostic test quits , and the E1/F6 codes begin to flash . I checked all connections at the CCU ( pulled out the plugs , inspected them , and re-secured them solidly ) to no avail . Apparently , there is a plug in the wiring between the CCU and motor , but for the life of me , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads I was reviewing on here ( other people with F6/E1 error codes ) had the same model washing machine as I did .

Today I used it and when I closed the door after removing the food ( timer off/no time on the counter ) , it was making a humming noise . Not as loud as when running the oven but audible if you were near it . Almost as if an appliance is " trying " to turn on but can't--like it is stuck . When I opened the door , the humming would stop and the interior light would come on fine . I then put some food in the oven , started the oven for about 30 seconds and it heated the food fine . No unusual noises when heating that food . But again , when I turned it off and closed the door , the humming would start again . I unplugged it for about an hour and when I plugged it back in , the humming was gone but now it wo n't heat food . Besides that it operates as normal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior lights , the timer , the start/stop buttons , the keypad all function properly . It turns on , the platter spins , but no heating of food . Again , the humming is now gone when it is off and the door is closed . Also , when the oven was working , if you set the " power level " to say 5 out of 10 , you could hear when the oven 's " heating unit " ( for lack of a better term ) would come on . It " cycles " on and off 50% of the time . At power level 10 , it was always " on " . Now audibly , whether at power level 10 or 5 , that " power on " sound is missing . Searching the internet , I 've seen general comments that the control board is bad , the magnetron is bad , the transformer is bad , the capacitor is bad , the door latch is bad , the diode is bad , etc. , etc . I do n't have the experience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I am go with a " hit-or-miss " part purchase I want the best chance of being right . So , what is the most likely defective part I am looking at needing given the above symptoms . I took the control panel out and it " looks " fine--no burnt or scorched areas . But that 's all I got . Any help is appreciated . Thx . <p> When you say " smart board " do you mean the control panel ? Basically the touch pad with buttons and on/off switches ? That comes out pretty easily .

He is at a parts store and did it as a courtesy . So , if I am going to the next step of the main control board , what and how do I test that ? Does it need to be in or out of the microwave oven to test ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the electrician I took them to <p> Good to hear about the switches , but we normally check them in place in case something in the mechanism is not tripping the switch(s) correctly . <p> So , if I am going to the next step of the main control board , what and how do I test that ?

Hoping to find help as to where to start looking for repair . Thank you ! <p> Sounds like I should check the water pump first to avoid ordering a part I do n't need ? Will get that pinch-off tool tomorrow . Thanks for addressing the sitting water problem , I forgot to ask if there was a way to drain it . <p> So we took the water pump off and there was nothing visibly wrong with it and one coupling kind of fell out , the other coupling we kept on but looked at and there was nothing visibly wrong either coupling . We put all back together and the same problem . Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , or are we supposed to just order the new parts , replace them and then see what happens ? PS We used a bucket brigade to drain the water instead of buying the tool ... it got wet , but nothing major . <p> So the water pump seemed fine . When my husband took the motor off the coupling fell off . I think my last message was confusing . But it sounds like we need to order a new coupling for the motor , right ? Also , I think this problem happened because I was washing sheets and I threw a towel in , too , which may have overloaded it . Does this commonly cause a coupling to get loose ? Is there any chance the motor is bad ? Thanks .

Dry tablet soap remains in dispenser-its not even wet at all , just warm from heat of dishwasher.2 . Liquid soap just runs down to bottom of washer , again no water getting to it seems like . <p> So is my dispenser not opening all the way ? Or is it a water issue not getting to the soap ( how does this actually work ) ?

So the spray arms are what actually spray and dissolve the soap tablets , correct ? I 'll get back to you after I find out more , thanks . <p> 1 . Water is going in , I can feel/hear water going in from piping at bottom because pipe gets hot and can feel water going thru it if you touch it as is pumping water in , plus opened up door as cycle going on and there is water at bottom of dishwasher , about the height of the heating element . I can also hear it " sloshing " around as cycle runs <p> 2 . Sprayers may be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and machine not running if I try to manually spin it , it does n't seem to spin that freely as it hits some of the plastic components inside as it trys to spin around , but I was thinking that the water pressure when activated and actually spraying water thru it , it may spin more evenly then when I try to manually spin it. ? It also seems to have move because as I checked it periodically during cycle it was in a different position when I opened up door vs. when I closed door and started a cycle . <p> Top sprayer ( not the very top sprayer as that one is rather small and not sure how much that actually even does anything ) , but the sprayer right below the top rack , the spouts/holes in it seem to be at an angle so when water shoots out of them it would hit the open dispenser with soap in it , causing the soap tablet to get wet and dispense the soap . There was 2 clogged ports within it , so I cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let cycle run and opened it up a few times as cycle running , the sprayer was always in the same exact position , like it never moved . Could this then be the problem ? and why/how to fix that ? <p> Followed video and took apart lower assembly , cleaned it all out , put back together , and whalla ! Test wash with cleaning tablet in dispenser , after complete cycle done , opened up , tablet gone , upper spray arm looks like it was moving and must of been since tablet was gone as it was n't doing this before . Did n't need to buy new chopper screen as of yet ( looked ok , just cleaned it off a bit ) . Will remember how to fo this as is something that should be done every once in awhile as problem was build up of grime , food particles , etc. causing blockage of water flow .
