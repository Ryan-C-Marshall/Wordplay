Read the question . <p> It 's critical that you read the question before you do anything else . Once you read the question , be sure that you understand it completely . A good way to make sure you understand the question is to reword it . Chances are , if you can reword it , then you fully understand what it is asking . <p> The science question-prompt will always ask you to make two types of responses . It is important that you know what type of response you are being asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Am I creating a paragraph response ? OR <p> Am I designing an experiment ? <p> 2 . Read the passage . <p> Once that you understand the question , go ahead and read the passage . As you read , pay attention to the passage , asking yourself : <p> What specific details can I find that relate to the question ? <p> What information can I find to support or counter the question ? <p> What are major points or claims is the author making ? <p> 3 . Construct your thesis . <p> Whether you are designing an experiment or writing a paragraph response , you must include a thesis . <p> Paragraph Response : <p> Your thesis is used to state your position <p> Designing an Experiment : <p> Your thesis is used to describe your experiment design <p> 4 . Brainstorm &amp; Plan Your Response . <p> Use your white board to plan out your response before you start writing . <p> Create your main point <p> Find data , information or statements from the text that support your main point <p> Briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Checklist : <p> Must include actual information , facts and/or data from the text <p> Should be one to two paragraphs in length <p> Includes a well-constructed thesis statement <p> Designing an Experiment Checklist : <p> A well-stated hypothesis <p> A clear design <p> An easy to understand method of collecting data <p> A means of evaluating your hypothesis <p> 6 .

This next portion will take you through the six-step process above by using an example prompt . Please , follow along ! <p> Step One : Read the prompt . <p> In the GED- Science Exam , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt : <p> Design a controlled experiment that would help Smith test his hypothesis . Be sure to include a method and descriptions of data collection . Also , explain how researchers would know whether his hypothesis is supported by the experimental data . <p> Step Two : Read the passage . Here is our sample passage:Smith is a florist , who owns a local flower shop . He recently bought ten acres of land to farm plants and flowers on , in order to sell them at his flower shop . Before he begins farming , he wants to test the acidity levels to determine which area will best support his different types of flowers . <p> Smith wants to grow a large crop of begonias , which prosper in soils with low acidity levels . He also wants to grow azaleas , which do best in soil with high acidity levels . <p> Smith wants to separate the plants by growing one type of plant per acre . <p> Smith believes that if he can determine soil acidity levels , he will be able to properly grow his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis . <p> Okay , so we know that the prompt is asking us to design an experiment . And , when we are designing an experiment , our thesis statement is used to describe our experiment . Therefore , my thesis is going to be : <p> To determine what soil acidity levels would create the best growing conditions for his plants , Smith will need to test the pH levels of each acre of soil . Areas with a high pH level will be more acidic , while areas with lower pH levels will be less acidic . <p> Step Four : Brainstorm and plan . <p> Now that we have our thesis , we need to figure out a method for collecting data , measuring data and determining which plants should go where . For this , we are quickly going to brainstorm ideas about what the passage tells us , as well as what we already know . Personally , for this process , I like to make a list of what I know vs. what the passage says in order to determine a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether acidity levels are high or low.The passage says : There are ten acres of land.We know : We should divide the land evenly to determine different levels of soil acidity.The passage says : Smith wants to grow one type of plant per acre.The passage says : Begonias grow well in low acidity soil , while azaleas grow well in high acid levels of soil . <p> Step Five : Write . <p> This would be the portion where I would JUST start writing . You see , I can apply everything I know from my brainstorming list ( above ) to my response . <p> Smith would need to begin by taking ten different soil samples : one from each of the ten acres , labeling each sample with its corresponding acre . He would need to get a pH soil test kit . Next , Smith would need to test each of the ten acre samples by following the directions on the pH soil test kit . He should then record his answers . Determining the pH soil acidity , he could then determine which plant would prosper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revise . <p> I would then use this time to go back and edit for grammatical errors , missing elements and make sure that I have included information from the passage . <p> For example , I might want to add that the begonias would be planted in acres with a low pH and azaleas in a high pH level . <p> Hopefully this sample has given you the tools you need to write your own refection . Remember , you do n't  need luck , you just need confidence and practice . 198145 @qwx398145 198141 @qwx398141 198144 @qwx398144 <h> Legal Junk <h> Contact Us 198145 @qwx398145 
@@37871385 @6871385/ <h> The Fertile Crescent and Bodies of Water in Ancient World History : Lesson Ten <h> Part One : Informational Readings <p> Read the excerpts below . <h> Egypt <p> ( 1 ) Rivers became the heart of many ancient civilizations . It was discovered that along rivers , populations were not only able to maintain their communities , but they were able to prosper . Creating a life along rivers allowed civilizations to evolve out of their nomadic lifestyles , that previously caused them to move frequently from place to place based on season and food supply . But , once settled among the rivers , people were able to take on a new , stable habits that allowed them to remain in one place for a long period of time . <p> ( 2 ) Particularly , the Egyptians took to life among the Nile River as an easy means of survival . By 5000 B.C.E , people along the Nile were taking advantage of the now fertile soils created as a result of previous flooding . Along the Nile , they were capable of creating irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , because they were able to sustain themselves , their community 's government became more stable and advanced . <p> ( 3 ) By 3000 B.C.E , the Egyptian civilization prospered under a pharaoh , who was an Egyptian king . Egyptians believed that pharaohs were part god-part human . In homage to the pharaohs , Egyptians built pyramids , which they believed would house their gods in the after death . Building the pyramids was an intensive and laborious project . It required more people than the city was able to offer . In time , many of the builders were actually slaves . These people , who were being punished for their debts or other offenses , gave the country an inexpensive solution for completely their massive project . <h> Greece and Rome <p> ( 4 ) Ancient Greece prospered around the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea . In fact , they not only prospered , but they were able to build an entire empire ! Greek communities were able to establish large communities along the sea , which allowed them to import food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established the first political democracy . The rest of Greece , however , was not as politically sound and agreeable . There were often battles of power and land that led to wars among city-states . <p> ( 5 ) Eventually , the Greek Empire fell to its Roman conquerors . Rome was an incredibly strong and advanced empire . They used the seas to their full advantage , pursuing city-states along waterways and then pushing on inland . The leaders of Rome , further used the land to the best of their power by creating roadways , bridges , schools , hospitals and then putting these advancements onto surrounding city-states with the strength of their growing army.The Roman Empire remained in power until 476 BCE . <h> Part Two:A Practice Questions <p> 1 . What can you infer from the passage about the use of slaves to build the pyramids in Egyptian society ? <p> A. The society needed more help than they could afford to tackle such an endeavor and so requiring slaves to build the pyramids offered a cheap solution for finishing the project . B. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the slaves to stay there full time . Forcing slave labor created a place for them to go during the day . C. Because of their nomadic lifestyles , slaves were too difficult to transport from town to town , so needed a place to stay in the city . The government was able to house the slaves cheaply after working all day . <p> Answer:A . A. The society needed more help than they could afford to tackle such an endeavor and so requiring slaves to build the pyramids offered a cheap solution for finishing the project . <p> 2 . Based on the information provided in the passage , which of the following statements can you determine about the Egyptian and Greek civilizations ? <p> A. They enjoyed traveling and meeting other cultures . B. Overflow from rivers caused the land to become fertile , and allowed the perfect conditions for a prosperous community . C. They were stronger than the Roman empire because they both successful democratic systems in place . <p> Answer:B . Overflow from rivers caused the land to become fertile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Which of the following best summarizes the main idea of the reading ? <p> A. The use of slaves devalues and dehumanizes a cultural , despite the advancements they are able to make with a larger population . B. Despite success in the early years , contaminated water would eventually lead to the demise of cultures along rivers . C. Life along bodies of water allowed cultures to prosper and advance in ways earlier nomadic cultures could not . <p> Answer:C . Life along bodies of water allowed cultures to prosper and advance in ways earlier nomadic cultures could not . 198145 @qwx398145 198141 @qwx398141 198144 @qwx398144 <h> Legal Junk <h> Contact Us 198145 @qwx398145

Here are some tips to help you stay motivated for the GED , whether you are hoping to go to college or just get a better job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classroom . <h> Five tips on how to stay motivated studying for the GED. <h> 1 . Set SMART goals and write them down <p> The author , entrepreneur and business consultant , Michael Hyatt , suggests that people set SMART Goals . What makes these goals SMART is that they are : Specific , Measurable , Actionable , Realistic and Time-bound . Michael also suggests that people write down their goals . There are a certain power and intention in writing your goals down . Writing your goals down is the first step in bringing your goals from the imaginary world into the physical world . <p> Life is crazy and busy , and if you are anything like me you get distracted easilyvery easily . Its easy to lose track of your goals , get blown off course and spend your nights watching an entire season of Orange is the New Black instead of studying . <p> This is the reason you need to write down all the reasons you want to get your GED , to remind yourself of how important it is . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take pride in , or you dropped out of school when you had kids and you want to show to your children the importance of education , or you want to be the first in your family to go to college . Whatever reasons you have , they are important . Write them down in a list by hand and read it often , maybe even make it a daily routine . <h> 3 . Find Support and Get Help <p> Even if you think you can get your GED alone , it will be much easier with the support and help of others . Reach out to family and friends . Find a library , adult learning center or community college near you with classes . Try to find a study buddy . Tell the people in your life you know will support you . If that 's your family or friends great . Let them know some of your reason for wanting to get your GED . And things get a tough turn to them for support . <p> If you are looking for some extra support join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Progress <p> Break down whatever you are studying into smaller parts and stages . Splitting huge subjects into smaller tasks and milestones makes it easier for you to track your progress . Although tracking your progress is important to stay motivated , you need to recognize your progress , not just track it . Tracking and recognizing your progress are different . Tracking is simply taking a note of how far you have come . Recognizing your progress means taking a step back , realizing where you are in your studying , and how much more you have left . Recognizing your progress makes you feel good and want to continue studying . It helps you to keep the ball rolling and gain momentum in your studying . <h> 5 . Reward Yourself <p> This is a tip that I 'm sure all of you can get behind . Rewarding yourself is by far one of the easiest and most effective ways to stay motivated . Its ok to bribe yourself once in a while . <p> Not feeling much like studying . <p> Before you start studying , agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of time .
