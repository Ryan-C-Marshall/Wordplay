The QUEST program ( Question , Understand , Explore , Seek and Think ) is a pullout program for academically talented students in the district elementary and middle schools . The goals of the QUEST program are to promote creative thinking skills , higher cognitive operations , problem solving skills and to increase knowledge , comprehension and application in content areas . In addition to in-school opportunities , students are involved in special activities , which enable them to interact with other identified students in our district and in neighboring districts . These activities will prepare our learners for meaningful participation in both the classroom and community by valuing their individuality , recognizing their skills and instilling in them an appreciation of their ability to contribute to society . <p> Students meet in QUEST for approximately 90 minutes per week . In grades 5-8 , the schedule rotates through different class periods from week to week . <p> Multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-8 . Initial identification is done at the end of third grade for the fourth grade school year . A series of three benchmark activities are given to all third grade students . They include a Math Task , a Writing Prompt and a Creative Task . In addition , a parent checklist is sent to all parents/guardians of grade 3 students to collect additional information . Classroom teachers also share insight on students ' classroom performance through a teacher checklist . A review of the Cognitive Abilities Test ( CogAT ) taken in third grade is also part of the identification process . Once a student enters the QUEST program , the student may continue participating in the program each year through 8th grade unless it is decided otherwise by the parent , student and QUEST teacher . <p> All students are reviewed annually for QUEST participation .

One unit focuses on Mathematics and the second unit addresses Language Arts . The intention of these courses is to expand the number of students receiving enrichment in designated areas . Students are identified through standardized and/or state testing results and teacher recommendations . At the middle school level , students may choose to participate in enrichment opportunities after school , such as the Math Enrichment program and Science Olympiad.

I am very excited to begin the school year as your students teacher and I am looking forward to a great year ahead . <p> About Me <p> I am a Graduate of Kean University where I completed my Bachelor of Arts program majoring in Education K-6/5-8 with an academic concentration in Earth Science . I have been working in school environments for over ten years beginning by volunteering at an aftercare program as a tutor . Since then I have taken on many different roles in a school including a substitute teacher , a paraprofessional , and , most recently , a 6th and 8th grade leave replacement science teacher at Terrill Middle School . <p> My goal as an educator is to ensure that all students are working toward and achieving their own personal goals . While helping students to achieve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take risks and should always be questioning the world around them . <p> Our Curriculum <p> Our 8th grade units of study include Forces and Motion , Energy , Chemical Interactions and Changing Earth . As we incorporate the Next Generation Science Standards into our curriculum , your student will have ongoing opportunities to carry out scientific investigations and engineering design projects related to the disciplinary core ideas . <p> My Expectations <p> I expect all students to arrive to class on time with all appropriate materials and supplies for the day when the period begins . I also ask that all students treat everyone in the classroom with respect , do not interrupt , and maintain a positive attitude at all times . Rules within the Terrill Middle School Student Code of Conduct should be observed at all times . If a rule were to be broken the first consequence will be a verbal warning , second offense will be a private student conference to discuss the situation , and the third offense will be a teacher detention and a phone call home . Appropriate behavior will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special reward privileges at random . <p> Grading <p> I use a total point system for determining students grades . Each assignment ( homework , projects , labs , quizzes and tests ) will be allocated a point value , and with most of these assignments , a rubric will be used to determine points earned . The actual number of points earned is compared to the total possible points in order to determine the student 's grade . All points will be recorded in PowerSchool , the online grading system . Students , parents , and guardians will have access and grades will be updated frequently , you should always know exactly what your grade is . <p> Homework <p> I believe homework is important because it is a valuable aid in helping students to make the most of their experience in school . I give homework because it reinforces what has been taught in class , prepares students for upcoming lessons , and helps them to develop self-discipline , responsibility , and organizational skills . Homework will be assigned 4-5 times a week and will range from 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the due date for half credit up to a week after it was assigned . All homework assignments as well as electronic copies and resources can be found on my website : https : **27;28;TOOLONG .

If a student is absent they should check their team folder for a " While You Were Out Packet " summarizing what was worked on while they were out . If there are any other questions , the student should reach out to me for clarification . <p> Communication <p> Should you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me .

@@37074551 @6074551/ <h> Junior Varsity/Freshmen Philosophy <p> Sub varsity athletics are an integral part of the success of the varsity program . Junior Varsity and Freshmen sports allow student athletes to transition from recreation sports to a High School sport that requires six days of practice per week as well as an increased amount of games . Moreover , a working sub varsity program will enable the student athlete to mature in competition with other athletes who are in similar physical and mental conditions . In addition , the sub varsity program is designed to allow for student athletes to grow and mature in their sport through a coaching philosophy that is not focused on winning contests . The primary purpose is to foster the growth of the student athlete in competition . <p> All of the sports at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School do not have a sub varsity level . Fewer still have a dedicated freshmen level . This is a result of either interest in the sport or the nature of the sport . For example , the Track programs do not have a dedicated freshmen level because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freshmen and sophomore student athletes compete in novice meets restricted to only freshmen and sophomores . <p> Teams that have a sub varsity level are encouraged to create situations that allow for all of the students to have game experience throughout the season . The Administration encourages all sub varsity programs to follow a plan to ensure that student athletes have game experience . For Freshmen sports , the season should be divided into thirds . The first third allows all athletes to have significant playing time . The second third begins to limit the playing time based upon effort in practice and games , talent level , and game situations . The final third will see more playing time for athletes who have maximized their effort in practices and games , their talent , and their knowledge of the strategies of the coach . At the JV level , the breakdown is the nearly the same as the Freshmen level .

The background was produced by mixing various tints of a single color , creating snow covered hills and the sky . We then talked about aerial perspective , and how objects in the front of the picture plane are larger than ones further back . Students then added some winter objects and painted them in silhouette . Final touches were added by creating snow falling and covering surfaces of things like roofs , tree branches etc .
