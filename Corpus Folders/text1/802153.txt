" We women have n't had that support in the past . That 's come as a result of launching this league . " <p> Brennan , who 'll speak about women 's sport later this month at the Melbourne festival Think West , has no expectations about the success of AFL Women 's despite the popularity of several exhibition games staged between 2013 and 2015 . <p> Her attitude is partly tied to the relative shortness of the women 's season , which only runs through to March in the preseason to the men 's league . <p> " I think the sky 's the limit for women 's AFL but our game is still in its infancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing straight away but it 's going to be better in five or 10 years . My goal is to do this full time and be playing in that winter season . " <p> Queensland-born Brennan relocated to Melbourne four years ago to build her football career , and says in that time the growth of women 's AFL and women 's sport generally -- has been " incredible " . <p> But she knows there 's still a long way to go to combat deep-seated beliefs that women 's sport is n't on the same level as men 's . <p> " At the Brownlow red carpet , men were asked about their football careers and the women were just being asked what they wear , " she said . " Daisy Pearce , who 's the best woman player , was with her partner Angus Parry , but they do n't ask him what he 's wearing . " <p> " It 's got a long way to go , " she said . " I hope in the future that we 'll be on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially . " <p> That financial disparity between what sportsmen are paid and what sportswomen are paid is a growing issue ( and one recently addressed in netball ) . <p> Brennan hopes football-playing women will someday be rewarded equally , giving them the same opportunity as men to become better , full-time athletes . For now , she says she 's " so grateful " to earn enough money to play her sport part time . <p> " It feels like we 're breaking down so many barriers and going from strength to strength , " she told Coach , crediting the incredibly supportive " bubble " of the women 's football community . <p> " It 's a really positive community , " she said . " It 's all about just playing and being supportive of each other and working towards that common goal of having a national league .

 parents to get their GP 's advice if engaging the services of a complementary medicine practitioner for their child , after a four-year-old with autism was admitted to emergency following treatment by a naturopath . <p> Reporting in the British Medical Journal in October , doctors said that the naturopath had prescribed 12 holistic supplements , including calcium , vitamin D and camel milk , and the child was admitted to hospital with vomiting , constipation , weight loss and loss of appetite . <p> Tests revealed he had hypercalcaemia , which is a high level of calcium in the blood , as well as a high level of vitamin D , and it took two weeks for him to make a full recovery . <p> Doctors say the case highlights the fact that just because a therapy is " natural " does not automatically mean it 's safe . <p> Complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of therapies , including mind-body medicine , diet therapy , nutritional medicine , herbal therapy , manipulative medicine and acupuncture . <p> Some treatments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associate Professor Vicki Kotsirilos , GP and lead author of A Guide to Evidence-based Integrative and Complementary Medicine , told Coach that parents should look for well-trained and respected practitioners . <p> " It is important that parents do their homework to look into the benefits versus risks of therapies and ensure they receive the right balanced advice from a well-trained , accredited , trusted practitioner who keeps up-to-date with the research and is aware of any risks of treatment , " she says . <p> " Children , pregnant and lactating women are vulnerable groups and any natural therapies should be used cautiously in these groups . " <p> Associate Professor says that natural therapies can sometimes be used alongside proven treatments to improve people 's health but it 's important you inform your doctor . <p> " I have witnessed great responses to treatment by patients , " she points out . <p> " The risk is when parents choose alternative treatments and deny their child from having effective proven therapies , such as cancer treatments . " <p> Some complementary medicines , such as traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Practitioner Regulation Agency ( AHPRA ) registered and regulated . <p> But Dr says naturopaths are a self-governing body and that there is nothing stopping unaccredited and under-qualified people from calling themselves a " natural therapist " . <p> " You need to ask the practitioner where they did their training , " Dr says . <p> " Were they referred to you from a reliable source ? " <p> Dr says it 's important for practitioners to be aware of side effects of certain herbs and treatments . For example , high doses of vitamin B6 can cause nerve damage and there is a risk that taking black cohosh in menopause could cause liver impairment . <p> Dr Bastian Seidel , president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners , told Coach that many complementary medicines and remedies are not subject to the same regulation that medication is . <p> " Often they are not rigorously tested in the same way medications would be that you get from prescription in pharmacies , " he explains . <p> Dr Seidel says that it 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and the risk is that they could be a waste of money or in some cases , dangerous . <p> " If it does n't have any effect that 's fine , you 've just wasted some money , " he says . <p> " But it 's got to be safe that 's the main concern . If safety ca n't be demonstrated , I would be very concerned to give a medical recommendation of using it . " <p> If you 're interested in trying an alternative or complementary medicine , Dr Seidel suggests chatting about it with your GP . <p> " If you have read something online or in the popular press , bring the article with you when you see your GP and have a talk about it , " he says . <p> " We GPs have no financial interest in promoting a particular product or giving out any particular medications it 's in our interest just to have a decent consultation with the individual patient .

 actually enjoy the ' extreme shaming ' of bucks parties <p> Earlier this year I went to a wedding that was beautiful , romantic , perfect . However , the bucks ' party that proceeded it was ... not those things . <p> No one ended up naked and tied to a telephone pole ( which would have been preferable to some of the utterly unprintable , reluctantly remembered things which did happen ) . <p> But while some of the men present heartily enjoyed the traditional drinking and debauchery , others did n't seem quite as cool with it all -- especially when a pair of young ladies joined the party . <p> A new study suggests those uncomfortable partygoers are n't alone , finding many men do n't actually enjoy the " extreme shaming , humiliation , and deviance " of a bachelor party and only join in to ward off FOMO . <p> Dr Anthony Ellis and Daniel Briggs , from the University of Salford and the University of Madrid , embedded themselves in a number of stag parties around Ibiza , London , Liverpool , Manchester and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects goes on at a bucks night . <p> One groom was forced to visit a lap dancing club despite having no desire to " see half-naked dancing women , let alone pay them " , while another had offensive messages scrawled over his half-naked body . <p> The fellas who were n't getting married did n't fare much better : One partygoer was pressured to drink so much he soiled himself , another was robbed , many were badly injured , and one was left " genuinely f--king scared " when he became separated from his mates for several hours . <p> The researchers concluded that many bucks partygoers only succumbed to pressure to " suspend moral behaviour " because they felt it was expected of them . <p> The only thing the fellas scored in return for their unenjoyable antics was " cultural capital " that is , stories about the mischief they got up to that they can tell to impress other lads . <p> " We found this palpable feeling that people felt they had to enjoy themselves and if they did n't enjoy themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually experiencing was quite frightening , " Dr Ellis told the Telegraph . <p> " People told us that they had had quite troubling experiences and the general atmosphere at a bucks party is one of intense pressure to over-consume .

 holidays could spell trouble for your child 's weight <p> Running around at the park and spending time in the sun used to be the schedule for the summer school holidays , but scientists say it 's the prime time of the year for your child to get fatter . <p> New research from the University of Texas and the University of Oxford has found that children are at a greater risk of weight gain over the summer holidays than during the normal school year . <p> The reason why , speculate researchers , is that the summer holidays represent a time where excessive screen time , irregular meal times and poor sleep patterns run rampant . <p> " Educators have long worried that summer break leads to knowledge loss , and now we know that it is also a time of excessive weight gain for our youngest school children , " lead researcher Paul von Hippel said in a press release . <p> " Our results also suggest that we can not reverse the obesity epidemic if we focus only on what children are doing and eating while they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18,000 kindergarten students over a period of two years , tracking body measurements like weight and height periodically throughout the study . <p> At the start of the study , 8.9 percent of students were considered obese , and 23.3 percent were considered overweight . After the two years was up , the number of obese kindergartners had risen to 11.5 percent , and the number of overweight children rose to 28.7 percent . <p> Interestingly , all of the excessive weight gain could be traced back to the summer holidays spent at home none of the children gained weight during the school year . <p> For Professor Amanda Staiano , a spokesperson for the journal in which the study was published , these findings indicate that we should n't focus all of our healthy habits teachings for when kids are at school . <p> " Now that we have solid data pointing to summer vacation as a time for potential weight gain in young children , the next step is to work together to shape out-of-school behaviours , " said Staiano . <p> " Parents can take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-year sleep schedule and reducing screen time . " <p> In Australia , it 's recommended that children spend no more than two hours in front of a screen a day , to limit harmful side effects like poorer sleep quality and reduced concentration . <p> It 's estimated that the average Aussie kid spends about double this , with most four to five-year-olds getting a whopping four hours of time a day in front of the TV , computer or smartphone. <h> Ravenswood commercial centre 
 the diet behind his Bachelor body <p> It built him the kind of body that has the entire nation swooning , and now former Bachelor Tim Robards has shared the style of eating that 's guaranteed to help you lose weight and feel better . <p> It 's called the 7:2:1 diet but it 's not a diet per se . It 's a style of eating that heavily emphasises munching on real fruit and produce , while still keeping enough flexibility to retain your sanity . <p> " The way 7:2:1 works is really , really simple , " Robards tells Coach . <p> " Essentially , you want 70 percent of everything you eat to be made from whole , unprocessed foods you find on the outside aisles at the supermarket that 's the seven . <p> " Next is the two , and means 20 percent of what you eat should be ' sensible ' . This is for those times where you 're really craving something like pizza , but instead of ordering takeaway you choose ( or maybe even make ) a healthier pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , the one means 10 percent of everything you eat is relaxed , " says Robards . " This means if you go to someone 's house , or you 're at an event , you do n't worry too much about what you 're eating it 's life . " <p> It 's a similar approach to the long-standing " 80:20 rule " ? ( eat well 80 percent of the time , treat yo'self the remaining 20 percent ) , with a slightly less rigid tweak to the formula . <h> Sustainability made easy <p> According to Robards , the 7:2:1 approach is pretty much just sensible eating , but presented in a way that 's not only accessible but easy to break down . <p> " Take a look at what you 're eating over an entire week . If you 're a numbers person who eats three meals a day , that 's 21 meals a week , " explains Robards . <p> " Following the 7:2:1 approach , that means 15 of those foods will be made from whole foods only , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices , and two of those meals will be relaxed eating . " <p> Got it ? Good , because compared to many other diets where you force-feed yourself nothing but lemon juice and protein pills , the 7:2:1 is ultra-easy to follow . <p> " The number one thing , when it comes to eating for good health and little bit of weight loss if you want it , is making sure that what you 're doing is sustainable , " says Robards . <p> " It 's no use doing some extreme diet when you know you 're only going to fall off the bandwagon a day later . " <h> The diet for those who ca n't stand rules <p> Best of all , the 7:21 approach is pretty much applicable to everyone -- it does n't matter whether you 're a mum of four or a grandfather entering his twilight years , the general guidelines of eating healthily still remain . <p> For Robards , the idea of the 7:2:1 approach did n't just happen overnight . It came as a result of seeing people constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having the proper tools to lose it . <p> " Where the 7:2:1 style of eating started was after spending years as a chiropractor and health coach and seeing all of these people come in to me with weird aches and pains that mostly boiled down to them being overweight , " says Robards . <p> " I needed to address the underlying issue without saying to someone ' you ca n't eat this ' or ' you must cut that out ' . <p> " Every day I saw people struggling with restrictive diets and thought there had to be a more sensible approach . " <h> Counting calories is n't a must <p> If you 're looking to lose weight , Robards says the 7:2:1 diet is an excellent way to frame how you 'll eat , but you 'll have to try to avoid bingeing because it is still possible to gain weight eating only healthy food . <p> " In a way , the calories will take care of themselves on this style of eating , but you do have to be fairly sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Obviously someone like me will need more protein than say , my girlfriend , so it 's good to use the hand method try having a portion of protein that 's as big as your palm , some healthy fats as big as three fingers , and as much veggies and salad as you can fit in two hands . " <p> At the end of the day , Robards stresses that there is n't any " weird trick " or " shortcut " to the 7:2:1 -- it 's simply about making sure that the majority of your diet is made up of real food , and not to beat yourself up when you do have a big night out or dinner with friends . <p> The Federal Treasury 
 such a thing as being too healthy it 's called orthorexia nervosa <p> Many of us might imagine a future when we naturally shun wine and laziness , choosing instead to munch mung beans because we actually want to . <p> But as ideal as that sounds , trying to adhere to a perfect diet can be a slippery slope to the unhappy world of orthorexia , defined as an obsession with eating healthy foods . <p> " When someone has orthorexia , eating pure , healthy foods has become more than just an attempt to increase the nutritional aspects of their diet it has taken dominance over the person to the exclusion of other areas of their life , " Loren Byford , psychologist at Eating Disorders Victoria , told Coach . <p> " It is an extreme , obsessive and limiting condition that results in unbalanced behaviours , such as withdrawing from social functions and eliminating entire food groups . <p> " The focus and dedication to eating clean food is the dominant focal point of a person 's life . " <p> Naturopath Karina Francois says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering orthorexia coming to her clinic wanting advice on how to lead a " perfect " healthy lifestyle . <p> " Enthusiasm for healthy eating is not orthorexia it occurs when it transforms into an obsession , " Francois told Coach . <p> " It can start with someone wanting to follow a fad like going paleo and god forbid they eat a potato it takes over their life and they think ' I am a bad person ' . " <p> Francois says that she also sees it in her daily life if anybody hears she is a naturopath they closely watch what she eats , almost looking for evidence of her not eating perfectly " clean " . <p> " With orthorexia , there is a righteousness about it , " she says . <p> " They have an obsession with being ' good ' and it 's self punishing . If they have a cup of coffee instead of a green smoothie they think they are impure . " <p> Social media , in particular Instagram , could be playing a part with images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly healthy all of the time . <p> " The way social media allows images to be altered presents a unique challenge to embracing an accepting and balanced approach to body image and diet , " Byford says . <p> If Francois suspects a client has orthorexia , she refers them to a psychologist experienced in eating disorders . <p> " The client has to understand that food is only a small element of our life it is not going to make them a better person and it 's irrational to base your self esteem on the quality of your diet , " she says . <p> Byford says the sooner you get professional assistance , the better . <p> " Many who experience problematic levels of clean eating behaviours and beliefs do not seek help , " she says . <p> " This may be due to denial that an issue exists or feelings of uncertainty or embarrassment talking about the issue . " <p> " Protective strategies include critically evaluating images and messages received on social media , socialising and having hobbies , enjoying a wide variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bad ' , and ensuring you have access to a variety of ways to invoke feelings of relaxation and coping with stressors , " she says . <p> Her father 's 
 health like a video game is the key to success <p> There 's the sweating , the grunting , the uncomfortable breathing and above all the pressure to do everything in skin-tight lycra . Yep , motivating yourself to exercise can be a real chore . <p> If you dread the idea of going to the gym , experts believe that treating your next workout or healthy habit like a video game instead of some odious , horrible task may be the key to your best-ever body . <p> It 's called " gamification " , and according to Tim Robards , founder of the self-titled Robards Method , it 's the easiest way to keep you motivated when hate eating healthily or exercising . <p> " Gamification is pretty much approaching your workouts like they 're a game , to not only make your training more enjoyable but to give it a better sense of purpose , " Robards tells Coach . <p> For too long the gym has been seen as the domain of the stereotypical " jock " who 's more likely to be sculpting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all of that 's changing . <p> With the rise of ultra-intricate fitness trackers like FitBit , JawBone and Under Armour , the business of getting fit is nerdier . <p> The days of " do you even lift , bro ? " are gone , only to be replaced with " did you even log that , bro ? " <p> According to Robards , the reason gamification has become so popular is simple : it makes working out fun again . <p> " Think about the way you play any PlayStation or video game there 's always different levels and a journey you have to go on before you succeed , " says Robards . <p> " Your health and fitness is actually exactly the same you 've got to have concrete , achievable goals and you 've got to increase your skills and strength slowly over time . <p> " Remember you do n't start a new game and expect to be a pro at it overnight . Like your fitness goals , the key is to take little steps towards them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try treating everyday life as if you were the developer of this all-encompassing societal game . <p> There 's the dangerous bad lands where you 'll lose life points ( takeaway food shops ) , the enemies who try to bring you down ( friends who say your meal-prep is " boring " or " bland " ) , the big bosses you need to beat to clear a level ( squatting your bodyweight ) and the cheat codes that help you progress faster ( like doing HIIT over jogging ) . <p> For example , instead of constantly telling yourself " I have to lose two kilos every week " , try unlocking new achievements like going to the gym two days in a row , or eating healthily for an entire day . <p> The more achievements you unlock , the healthier you become , and the more successful you are at surviving the game of life . <p> Essentially , you 're breaking down the bigger picture ( like the goal of looking like an Instagram model ) into smaller , more manageable tasks ( like making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robards explains , by approaching your health like a game , you 're less likely to slip into the " I 'm a total failure " mindset that tends to happen when big things do n't always go to plan . <p> " It 's important because so many people do n't see a shift in weight on the scale , or use the same weight every time they go to the gym , and feel down on themselves , " says Robards . <p> " By approaching your health like a game , you 're always unlocking new achievements even if they seem small . " <p> This mindset is particularly helpful for those who have tried every diet and fitness routine under the sun , only to find themselves giving up after two days ' time and time again . <p> The reason why is because it uses personal reflection as a goal creator instead of staring down that fit girl squatting in the gym and wondering how you can be like her , you focus on what you can do to make yourself better . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ' attitude where if they exercise , they go ultra-hardcore straight away and train like a professional athlete , " says Robards . <p> " It 's far more sustainable to work at an intensity that suits your current level of fitness . If that 's walking around the block twice , then that 's a fantastic place to start . " <p> Of course , gamification is n't for everybody . <p> If the last time you played a video game was racking up hours on Pac-Man in the ' 80s , then the idea of " unlocking achievements " or " gaining experience points " may seem a little lame to you . <p> But if you spend as much time on the internet role-playing a wizard healer who goes on quests as you do in the gym , then approaching your health like a game could just be the cheat code you needed to kick-start your fitness . <p> " It provides a little reward for people , because in fitness there really is no such thing as a quick fix , so people become discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By approaching it like a game , you 're much likely to hang in there in the first couple of months , and get really excited about working out and more importantly by what your body can achieve .

 the president . Here 's how to cope . <p> The seemingly unthinkable has happened , and Donald Trump is now president of the United States of America . It appears that no amount of media gaffes or ill-made tweets was enough to sink his orange-hued presidential ship . <p> For all of us here in Australia , it will take weeks -- even years -- to realise what effect it will have on us . <p> But if you 're feeling pretty damn stressed out about Trump perching in the Oval Office in January , it 's important to remember that there are ways of coping in the meantime . <p> The first point of call , according to psychologist Professor Tracey Wade , is to recognise that what you 're feeling is totally normal . <p> " Feeling stressed about the result is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation a candidate for high office whose character many people find offensive is not something we are used to facing in democracy , " Wade tells Coach . <p> " Usually the really unsatisfactory people have been sieved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of a heavy heart and a light headache ? Do n't go googling symptoms , because what you 're feeling is despair , which comes from a genuine belief that all hope is lost . <p> " In a normal circumstance , when someone 's preferred candidate does n't win their emotions can range from disappointment , some sorrow , or indifference , " says Wade . <p> " In the current situation , where it seems to have serious global consequences , anxiety and a sense of despair may actually be the more common emotions . <p> " There 's also a sense of unreality , like when those big public moments in life happen , such as Princess Diana 's death or John Lennon 's assassination . " <p> At some point , you 'll have to admit to yourself that the man you spent months ridiculing with memes on social media now actually has the nuclear codes he joked about using . <p> To combat the crushing reality of it all , Wade has a couple of handy tips , the first of which being simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Second , focus on the things in your life you can control the big public things such as how you respond to others and making the choice to respond in the high way rather than the low way . <p> " It 'll also help to focus on the small private things , such as which route you will drive home tonight , what you will have for dinner -- everything counts ! " <p> Lastly , Wade recommends taking control of your emotions by funnelling them into actions that are respectful and constructive , even if the idea of tolerating a Trump presidency is too much for you to handle . <p> " A good coping strategy is to start becoming an active citizen , " advises Wade . <p> " I always think about the famous Edmund Burke quote , that ' The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing ' . Try to get involved in promoting ' the good ' in a constructive way . " <h> Vaping ' gateway 
 is booming and it 's women driving the boom , according to the boss of one of Australia 's top natural health companies . <p> Blackmores chairman Marcus Blackmore believes that while everyone is becoming more interested in health and wellness , it 's a trend fuelled by women , and especially by mums . <p> " Women generally have the responsibility for looking after the family 's health , " he told Coach . " If you 're bringing up kids , you sure in hell want to know what those kids are eating and what 's good for them . " <p> Blackmore , 71 , is a big , colourful character with a big voice a side-effect of hearing loss sustained during the Vietnam War . I meet him on Sydney 's northern beaches at the Blackmores campus , a lavish facility rich with greenery and running water . <p> It 's a long way from the small natural health company founded by Maurice Blackmore , Marcus 's father , in Brisbane in the late 1930s . Then , the Blackmore family cranked out its wares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory pumps out more than 2 billion minerals , vitamins and herb pills a year , and was recently named most trusted vitamins and supplements brand by Reader 's Digest for the eighth year running . <p> One of Blackmores ' early Brisbane laboratories <p> Blackmores is often dubbed a vitamin company , a description Marcus dismisses as too limited . <p> " I think there are far greater results to be achieved through the use of minerals and herbs than vitamins , " Blackmore said . <p> " My father practiced as a naturopath and he rarely used vitamins . His focus was on minerals and herbs . " <p> That focus was " not popular in those days , " said his son " but now , everybody goes to doctors with cramps and they get magnesium . " <p> It 's just one instance where Blackmore says his father was well ahead of health trends , notably the " no sugar " fever that 's gripped clean . <p> " My father would never allow white sugar , " he said . " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , but he would never have allowed mum to have free-flowing sucrose in the house . He said ' It is poison ' . And this was 60 years ago . " <p> Nor did Blackmore snr permit white bread , long before most people knew anything about the importance of complex carbohydrates and whole grains . <p> " You need whole grain bread , " said Blackmore . " Once you process the grain you take all the big complex vitamins out of it and so on . " <p> He acknowledges that though general interest in wellness and the complementary health industry have grown , that does n't mean the population is healthier overall which is confirmed by a glance at Australia 's worrying obesity statistics . <p> Blackmore blames that partly on the government allowing the food industry to dictate food labelling , resulting in labels that are " the most confusing bloody of things all the time " to the average person . <p> " The label tells you how much protein and carbohydrates what the hell does that actually mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you added in there . Tell me what preservatives you 're using , not a whole bunch of numbers . " <p> He also blames the usual suspects : poor eating habits , sedentary jobs and a lack of exercise . <p> " Nature 's natural philosophy is getting the body to heal itself and the body can only heal itself by reproducing new cells , which it does millions at a time , " he said . " But it can only do that in blood supply , and we know blood supply is absolutely a function of exercise . " <p> Sponsored by Blackmores , the annual Sydney Running Festival is a major event on the fitness calendar ( AAP ) <p> But Blackmore is upbeat about the future of health , particularly the increasing attention on gut health the interplay of the microorganisms living inside your intestines , which medical science suggests could impact every other system or your body . <p> " We 're going to see more and more research in that space , " Blackmore said . " You can take all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not healthy and you 're not absorbing them you are wasting your time . " <p> Two goals and 
 get regular mental health check-ups ? <p> This week , Jesinta Campbell revealed that she regularly sees a mental health professional to deal with the tension caused by living a life that 's constantly under the spotlight . <p> Opening up to OK ! magazine , Campbell spoke about routinely seeing a therapist to " download all my worries and stresses " , saying that she always left sessions feeling " mentally lighter " . <p> So that got us thinking if you can afford it , should everyone see a mental health professional as regularly as they see their physio , even if you 're not diagnosed with anything ? <p> The answer , according to Steve Ellen , head of emergency psychiatry at Alfred Health , is not really . <p> " It 's an interesting question , and we have to remember that the bottom line is that 45 percent of people will have a mental health problem in their lifetime that 's significant enough to warrant professional help , " says Ellen . <p> " Overall , for most people , I would say no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional on a regular basis but they should see their GP routinely . " <p> According to Ellen , having a robust relationship with your local doctor even if you feel perfectly fine is the best approach to your mental health , because they will be able to spot if things do n't feel right . <p> " GPs are perfect for doing mental health screenings , and they will always ask their patients sometimes subtly -- how they think they are coping with their life , work and overall stress levels , " explains Ellen . <p> " However there are some caveats . People who should regularly check in with a specific mental health professional as opposed to a general doctor are those who have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness , anyone who 's had a significant trauma in their life , and anyone who has a strong family history of mental illness . " <p> If you lead a particularly stressful life , and know that your mental health is generally pretty good , it 's important to accept that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress and sadness . <p> In this instance , Ellen recommends talking to somebody you trust instead of bottling it all up and soldiering on . <p> " Remember not everybody wants ' health advice ' even if they need it , " says Ellen . <p> " Talking about what 's affecting you mentally with your support network is helpful , and for some people that may be a close family member , a trusted friend or a minister of religion . " <p> Overall , it 's important to try and distinguish between feeling a little bit run-down mentally , and having a really serious mental health episode in which case there are enormous amounts of avenues open to you for help . <p> " Of course , it 's really important to remember we are referring to well people here , " advises Ellen . " If you feel like you need help , the services are there for you and many professionals in the private system bulk bill to make it more affordable . " <p> As boring as it might sound , prevention really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to Ellen , the best way to keep your happiness and coping abilities in-check is to make sure you nail the five pillars of mental health , which any GP can take you through if you 're feeling particularly anxious or stressed . <p> " If someone were to keep to these five pillars consistently , then they theoretically would never need to see a mental health professional in their lifetime , " says Ellen . <h> 1 .

Try to limit the amount of caffeine you have each day , and the amount of alcohol keep it to two drinks a day or less , " suggests Ellen . <p> " We get patients who have a terrible time sleeping , and after a bit of questioning we discover they 've been drinking coffee at midnight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' do n't drink any coffee after 5pm ' and moving that run to 7pm , we find the patient comes back in a few weeks feeling refreshed for the first time in their lives . You 've just got to take notice of the habits you have . " <h> 2 . Eat a healthy diet <p> Eating healthily is a no-brainer , but many people do n't instantly recognise the connection between their bodies and their brain . According to Ellen , what you put in your mouth can take far more of a toll on your state of mind than you think . <p> " A varied diet high in nutrients is also extremely important for general mental health , " advises Ellen . <p> " We 're learning so much about how the gut biome effects our mental state , so it 's really important to eat as healthily as you can to help this along . " <h> 3 . Get regular exercise <p> Whether you 're coping with a mental illness , or simply want to arm yourself against any issues in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do you a world of good . <p> " I honestly can not speak highly enough of the power of regular exercise to help people deal with mental health issues , " says Ellen . <p> " Of particular note is any kind of exercise that involves mindfulness , and for that , yoga is king . " <h> 4 . Pay attention to your relationships <p> Do you have a frenemy who always makes you feel like you 're not good enough for them ? Or are you being a frenemy to someone else ? Do a routine check of your friends list to make sure you 're not leading someone on just because you feel like you should . <p> " Once a year maybe when you 're checking your fire alarms to use an example have a think about how the relationships in your life are effecting you , " advises Ellen . <p> " Are there some relationships you need to work on ? How about some people in your life that are toxic ? By looking at your relationships your evaluating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at your stress in general <p> Chronic stress is such a common condition in any workplace that many people feel like it is " the norm " . Over time , this excess stress manifests itself in many different nasty ways so it 's important to simply recognise how you 're coping every so often . <p> " It may sound obvious , but general life stress ( normally provided by work ) can have a huge effect on your mental health , " says Ellen . <p> " Take the time once a year to really ask yourself ' how am I doing ? ' and ' am I okay with this amount of stress in my life ? ' . <p> " It sounds simple , but recognising this stress can be tough . We 've had patients working 60 to 70 hours a week to pay off a beach house they do n't even need , and their mental health suffers as a result . " <h> QUT responds to 
 butt ' is actually a sign of poor posture <p> What do the Kardashians , social media fitness models and truck drivers all have in common ? No , it is n't the ability to take a great selfie ( only two out of three qualify for that one ) it 's the presence of what we 've dubbed " Instagram butt " . <p> And while it sounds like some kind of gross hygiene issue you 'd only see on Embarrassing Bodies , Instagram butt has nothing to do with the size ( or cleanliness ) of your moneymaker , and everything to do with your posture . <p> If you answered yes to all three , then it 's likely you too have a case of Instagram butt a pose that might make for a good Insta shot , but can signal poor posture if it 's a stance you naturally hold in everyday life . <p> According to physiotherapist Holly Brasher from Square One Physio who knows Instagram butt by the name excessive lumbar lordosis causing an anterior pelvic tilt the condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on how extreme the arch is in your lumbar vertebrae ( the fancy name for your lower spine ) . <p> " It 's important to remember the spine is naturally curved and everyone should feel a little bit of an arch in their lower back , " Brasher tells Coach . <p> " It 's only when that arch becomes or looks quite excessive that it becomes pronounced lumbar lordosis and gives you that anterior tilted pelvis " that is , hips that tilt forward , causing your butt to stick out . <p> Yes , we know sticking out your butt is the best way to give yourself that Brazilian figure on an iPhone camera ( especially if you also peek seductively over one shoulder ) , but keep up the pose over time and you 'll likely find yourself stuck that way . <p> " There 's a few different ways that people end up with an excessively curved lumbar . The first reason might be congenitally that 's just how your spine has developed since birth , " explains Brasher . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit because people can put their back in full extension in this posture , many can actually relax and end up standing like this all the time . <p> " You tend to see this in women who spend much of their day standing in high heels . " <p> Many experts believe an easy way to spot an excessive curve is by taking your top off , and standing side-on to a mirror . If the buckle of your belt is pointing to the floor instead of straight ahead -- you 're likely tilting your pelvis forward more than you should . <p> As Brasher explains , when you spend a lot of time sitting , your glutes become inactive and your hip flexors ( think of them as thick strips of muscle that connect the front of your legs to your hips ) become really , really tight . <p> For some people , the resulting arch in the lower spine can create pain that tends to worsen with load-bearing activities like weightlifting , while others can adopt this posture without having to crack open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how excessive or pronounced that arch is on whether or not you could say it is dysfunctional , " says Brasher . <p> " For some people , it can cause joint compression which could result in pain . It 's really a case of degrees there 's no one test that says ' yes , you 've got it ' . " <p> According to Brasher , just because you naturally feel more comfortable adopting a posture that looks like you 're does n't automatically mean you 're less athletic either in fact , many athletes have the condition . <p> " You tend to see excessive lordosis in a few athletes too , like gymnasts and up-and-coming cricket fast bowlers , " says Brasher . <p> " This is because they can adopt that kind of posture to help improve their physical performance but this could mean pain later down the track . " <p> The case for fixing your posture on-the-fly is pretty strong , but Brasher says it 's important not to get really wound up about having 100 perfect posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in a biomechanically comfortable " zone " . <p> " It 's important again to realise that a healthy spine does have curves , " says Brasher . <p> " A good posture is anything within a kind of ' neutral zone ' that has all of your muscles working to support your head , and your joints stacked up on top of each other . " <p> If you believe that your pelvis is tilting forward , then Brasher advises first working out what the correct posture feels like , and then hitting the gym to stretch and strengthen certain body parts . <p> " A good to way to try and correct it is to simply stand up straight against a flat wall or lie down somewhere that 's flat . Then simply try to ' flatten ' your back against the wall or floor , and try to feel the feedback on your lower back , " advises Brasher . <p> " Another great way to try and correct it is to stretch your hip flexors and spend some time strengthening your glutes with bridging @ @ @ <h> World 's best 
 drug of choice for cancer survivors <p> When you 've just beaten a bout of life-threatening bowel cancer , the last thing you 'd want to do is be pushed to exhaustion in some gym but for some many survivors , it 's the best medicine they 've ever taken . <p> New research presented at a cancer conference on the Gold Coast this week has demonstrated that high-intensity exercise can radically reduce post-cancer fatigue . <p> The finding contradicts traditional advice that cancer survivors should take things easy in recovery , and stick to gentle exercise like walking or yoga . <p> " Around 65 percent of people with cancer survive at least five years after their initial diagnosis , " says the study 's lead author Kirsten Adlard in a media release . <p> " However , 70 to 100 percent of cancer survivors will experience fatigue that can persist up to 10 years beyond treatment . " <p> A plucky group of 52 bowel cancer survivors were invited to the University of Queensland to participate in an experiment that pitted high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the course of eight weeks , the participants in the HIIT group performed a gruelling routine of four minutes of high intensity exercise , followed by three minutes of low intensity exercise . <p> After the study was complete , those who suffered through the tougher workouts actually reported more energy and less fatigue overall . <p> It sounds -- and no doubt feels -- counterintuitive to undertake the kind of exercise that makes you question your own sanity after cancer treatment , but Adlard believes it 's the quickest way to get patients feeling like their old selves . <p> " We were encouraged to find that bowel cancer survivors were capable of high intensity exercise , with no serious adverse effects , " says Adlard . <p> " Those who performed HIIT three times a week for eight weeks experienced a significant decrease in their fatigue levels , while those performing moderate intensity exercise experienced consistently high levels of fatigue . " <p> It 's a finding that Professor Mei Krishnasamy , President of the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia , tends to agree with , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise as a form of treatment . <p> " Exercise is an important new cancer medicine and research suggests it should be prescribed to cancer survivors just like any other medicine , " explains . <p> Not only does exercise -- particularly heart-pumping interval exercise make cancer survivors feel better and recover faster , it may also improve survival rates and add years to someone 's life . <p> " In recent years , research has widened our understanding the benefits of exercise for those undergoing cancer treatment in terms of providing quality of life , " says . <p> " Now we are starting to see more research that shows that exercise can also help cancer survivors reduce their ongoing symptoms and improve their odds of longer-term survival .

 your phone reveals a surprising ( and scary ) amount about you <p> The smears on your phone screen are usually wiped away without a second thought so you might not realise they contain a lot amount of information about you . <p> Researchers from the University of California , San Diego examined phone grime to produce a surprisingly ( and scarily ) insightful " lifestyle read-out " of the phone 's owner . <p> " We could tell if a person is likely female , uses high-end cosmetics , dyes her hair , drinks coffee , prefers beer over wine , likes spicy food , is being treated for depression , wears sunscreen and bug spray and therefore likely spends a lot of time outdoors all kinds of things , " said Dr Amina Bouslimani . <p> And you thought that mysterious smudge on your phone was only good for blocking the view of your newest text message . <p> In a study led by UC San Diego professor Dr Pieter Dorrestein , 39 adult volunteers had their hands and phones swabbed for samples that were analysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up medications including anti-fungal screams , hair loss treatments and anti-depressants , as well as food particles such as citrus , caffeine , herbs and spices . <p> It also revealed trace elements of products that the phone 's owners had n't used for months , such as sunscreen and mosquito repellents suggesting sampling phone crud can paint a long-term picture of its user , and does n't only uncover information about what you did the day the sample was taken . <p> These lifestyle read-outs are n't one-to-one matches with a phone 's owner , but they might one day become precise enough to act as a sort of fingerprint . <p> The research team believes analysing molecules could have a range of applications from health ( confirming people are taking their medications , checking their exposure to things in the environment ) , to surveillance ( criminal profiling , airport screenings ) and simply tracking down the owners of lost phones and other objects . <p> It 's tempting to read the result of the study and instantly swaddle your phone in sterilising alcohol wipes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to be too concerned about your phone 's hygiene . <p> Yes , it 's true that our devices are coated in germs , some of them potentially harmful ( particularly if you do n't wash your hands regularly ) .

 start to grumble at the mere sniff of a protein shake , you may very well be lactose intolerant or at least lactose sensitive and it 's way more common than you think . <p> It 's estimated that 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose , with some ethnicities like South East Asians having a rate closer to 90 percent . <p> As Patterson explains , the reason why you instantly start farting after a milkshake is because your gut lacks a certain kind of bacteria that 's evolved to process dairy largely because your ancestors probably did n't grow up around cows . <p> " Lactose intolerance is a condition caused by insufficient amounts of the gut enzyme lactase . The role of lactase is to digest and breakdown lactose in the gut , " says Patterson . <p> " When levels of lactase are low , this leads to poor digestion of lactose resulting in gut upset , bloating and stomach pain . " <p> All pretty scientific stuff . But if you 're looking for someone to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parents are a good place to start . <p> " The cause of lactose intolerance is largely genetic , but there can be times where people experience a short term period of lactose intolerance for example , after a bout of gastro which can temporarily diminish lactase levels , " says Patterson . <h> The solutions you 're left with <p> Okay , so if decadent full-cream milk protein shakes make your poop run faster than Usain Bolt , there 's no need to despair -- because you do still have a few options . <p> The first is to simply slow down the rate at which you 're drinking your shake . Gulping it down immediately after a weights session to make sure you 're hitting the " muscle building window " is n't just bro-science , it 's a recipe for bloating . <p> The second , according to Patterson , is to take a look at the label of your powder . If it says " whey protein concentrate " , then you may have re-gift it to a friend who can tolerate lactose ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relatives born in the United Kingdom , aka your Pom friends ) . <p> " Depending on why you are not tolerating protein powder will determine the next steps , " suggests Patterson . <p> " For those who are lactose intolerant , trialling a WPI powder ( low lactose ) is an option . Soy-based protein powders are an another alternative . " <p> Then there is the elephant in the room : instead of fretting over the gassy index of some $80 brand of protein powder , you could simply consume more protein in the form of real food . <h> The Smart car 
 , otherwise your gut bacteria will eat itself <p> Make sure to eat your fill of salad , beans and yoghurt because if you do n't your stomach will start eating itself from the inside out . <p> Yes , even though it sounds like the plot of some science fiction movie , researchers have discovered that without enough fibre , our gut bacteria literally begin to eat into the walls of your colon . <p> Scientists from University of Michigan made the grisly discovery after putting a squad of lab mice through an extremely low-fibre diet , and then analysing the contents of their guts . <p> The results were not exactly pretty . <p> " The lesson we 're learning from studying the interaction of fibre , gut microbes and the intestinal barrier system is that if you do n't feed them , they can eat you , " says lead author of the study Dr Eric Martens . <p> To understand why this happens , it 's important to know the role fibre plays in helping to keep our gut healthy . <p> Getting enough fibre does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining a healthy " gut garden " you 're doing your body a huge favour by helping it regulate everything from your mental health to your moods and even how clear you can think at work . <p> Well , according to Martens and his team of microbiologists , when you do n't eat enough fibre your gut bacteria literally begins to starve , and starts eating into the mucus wall that protects your colon . <p> Once that mucus wall is broken , your body is essentially open for business when it comes to infections inviting a whole range of health maladies to come your way . <p> Sure , the study was done on mice and not humans ( because frankly , it 's pretty unethical to subject even willing participants to that ) , but the researchers believe it 's just another cog in the puzzle of understanding how our gut effects our health . <p> The solution ? Easy simply aim to include some kind of fibre at most meals , and preferably from a range of sources . <p> " While this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humans amplifies everything that doctors and nutritionists have been telling us for decades : Eat a lot of fibre from diverse natural sources , " says Martens . <p> " Your diet directly influences your microbiota , and from there it may influence the status of your gut 's mucus layer and tendency toward disease . <p> But it 's an open question of whether we can cure our cultural lack of fibre with something more purified and easy to ingest than a lot of broccoli . " <p> If you 're wondering exactly how much fibre you need every day , The Heart Foundation recommends aiming for around 30 grams every day . <p> To put that in context , to reach that figure you 'd have to consume several slices of wholegrain bread , get five serves of vegetables , two serves of fruits and potentially a handful of nuts to round it off . <p> SBS World News 
 of alcohol every day could drop your risk of a stroke <p> That cheeky glass of wine or beer with dinner could be doing you a favour : lowering your risk of having a stroke . <p> A research team from Sweden 's Karolinska Institutet reviewed studies that examined the link between alcohol consumption and stroke risk , publishing their findings in BMC Medicine . <p> The team found that light alcohol consumption is associated with a 10 percent lower risk of ischemic stroke the most common type of stroke , which is caused by a blood clot blocking blood to the brain while moderate consumption is associated with an 8 percent lower risk . <p> Light to moderate alcohol consumption is defined as one two units or standard drinks per day . FYI , that 's not always the same as one-to-two drinks a single pint of beer or glass of wine can be equal to 1.5 units of alcohol . <p> The researchers found high to heavy alcohol consumption ( basically , anything more than two standard drinks per day ) is linked to an increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 14 percent increased risk of ischemic stroke , as well as increasing the risk of other types of stroke . <p> That held true for men and women , and in European , North American and Asian populations . <p> " The take home message from this study is that for those who drink alcohol , the consumption should be no more than one to two drinks per day , " wrote the study 's author , Associate Professor Susanna C.

 anthropologists the University of Arizona 's David Raichlen , Yale University 's Brian Wood and Hunter College 's Herman Pontzer strapped heart-rate monitors and GPS trackers to the Hadza , then analysed how far and fast they travelled each day . <p> That matters because the Hadza have a super low risk of cardiovascular disease , including low rates of high blood pressure and blood cholesterol , unlike us in the West stricken by the so-called diseases of civilisation . <p> Another noteworthy finding about the Hadza 's physical activity : it does n't decline with age . The older Hadza ( it 's not uncommon for them to live into their 70s and even 80s ) stayed as active as younger generations unlike our society , where physical activity drops off sharply as we age . <p> Raichlen acknowledges the Hadza 's heart health is likely influenced by other factors too ( such as their diets most continue to forage and rely on wild foods ) , but says studying their lifestyles bolsters the obvious-but-overlooked theory that aerobic activity is a must for health . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly active context , and that explains why physical activity seems to improve physiological health today , " he said in a statement . <p> He believes studying the Hadza gives us an insight into the physical activity levels that drove the evolution of healthy human hearts , muscles and brains . <p> " The answer is not likely 30 minutes a day of walking on a treadmill , " he said .

 of sugar and what you need to know about them <p> Not all sugars are created equal . Here 's what you need to know about the different varieties to help you help your health . <p> You might have got the memo that food ingredients ending in the letters " " are usually a science-y word for sugar the sweet ingredient that our body relies on to function , but can cause serious weight gain if we have too much . <p> " Food manufacturers use confusing marketing terms to hide the true amount of sugar in their foods , and this is something we all need to be aware of , " dietitian Rebecca Gawthorne told Coach . <p> In a nutshell ... <p> Glucose is a simple sugar and is the body 's main fuel source . <p> Fructose is the sugar that naturally occurs in fruit , but is also often added to processed foods and marketed as a " natural cane sugar-free replacement " . <p> Sucrose is the formal name for table sugar and is made from a combination of glucose and fructose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often added to processed food as a sweetener . <p> Maltose is also known as malt sugar and is found in foods that contain barley and malt . <p> Lactose is known as milk sugar and is made of a combination of galactose and glucose . It 's primarily found in dairy foods , and is also added to breads , processed snacks and baked goods . <p> Galactose is one half of lactose and is found in legumes and dairy products . <p> While many labels will list these words as ingredients , it 's hardly the extent of the sugar list . says there are a lot of other words you need to familiarise yourself with if reducing your sugar intake is your goal . <h> So which sugars are best ? <p> All the sugars contain around 63 kilojoules per teaspoon , but Gawthorne says their health rating comes down to the way you consume them . <p> " Refined sugars that are added to processed foods , including the ones listed above , all contain little negligible vitamins , minerals and antioxidants , " Gawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our intake of all of these refined , added sugars . Despite all the different ways sugar can be marketed , nutritional value of added sugars is very similar . " <p> According to Gawthorne , the bottom line is : " Sugar naturally present in whole foods is good , sugar added to food is not good " . <p> " It comes down to how our bodies process them , " she explains . <p> " When sugar comes in its natural form , like in fruits , it is accompanied by other nutrients like fibre , vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , phytochemicals and other beneficial nutrients . These change the way the body breaks down and absorbs these sugars . " <h> Glucose versus fructose <p> Glucose can be metabolised by almost every cell in the body but Gawthorne says that fructose can only be metabolised by the liver . <p> " If you consume a small amount of fructose , like from fruit , your body will store it as glycogen in the liver until you need it later on , " she explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from processed foods , your liver gets overloaded and turns the fructose into fat , which can lead to insulin resistance and other metabolic diseases , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , heart diseases and cancers . " <p> Added fructose can also cause stomach discomfort in some people . <p> " It 's important to note that it 's only when sugars are added to processed foods that these negative effects occur , " Gawthorne says . <p> " Remember that without naturally occurring sugar in healthy foods like vegetables and fruits , we can not function because sugar is the fuel for our brain and muscles . " <p> Ultimately you want to look out for all of these sugar code words on labels . When it comes to foods you 're eating every day , ideally they 'll be in smaller quantities and listed towards the end of the ingredients . <p> " Basically the more wholesome , fresh , natural foods and the less packaged , processed foods with labels you buy , the healthier you will be , " Gawthorne says . <h> Popular Stories <h> 
 it till you make it : Beware of power poses , study warns <p> TED talks are those viral speeches that spread big ideas , and one of biggest ideas was delivered by psychologist Amy Cuddy in 2012 . <p> A study by Cuddy and her team , first published in 2010 , suggested that adopting a " high power pose " for a couple of minutes boosts testosterone and decreases cortisol ( the stress hormone ) . <p> So even if you feel anxious or stressed , a power pose like " the Wonder Woman " , the best known example will make you feel confident , assertive and optimistic , transforming you into a winner . <p> Cuddy 's proposal to " fake it till you make it " is huge : her TED talk has 37 million views , and nervous people around the world now adopt two-minute power poses in the privacy of their office bathroom before they give presentations to their boss .

 of getting a Brazilian <p> From crafting a delicate landing strip to making everything smoother than a baby 's bottom , all of us have a preference for what kind of " personality " we give our nether regions . <p> For some , it 's a delicate dance that toes the line between daring and danger , being oh-so-careful to get a close shave without being so close you accidently give yourself a vasectomy . <p> For others , it 's a chore you simply do it because you 're expecting a little action , and want to make sure that the basement is as tidy as the entrance hall . <p> And now science has come to ruin the party for us all : New research from San Francisco General Hospital has found that getting a Brazilian increases your chance of contracting a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) by 80 percent . <p> The group most at risk are those classified as " extreme groomers " the men and women who painstakingly craft their pubic hair into something worthy of a MONA exhibition . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooming your genitals increases the risk of cuts and scrapes which can become infected , and being a regular groomer also means you 're more likely to be having a lot of casual sex . <p> ( Which makes sense , because statistically speaking having any sex at all increases your chances of contracting an STI by 100 percent . ) <p> Reaching this conclusion was a little subtler than hiking down the pants of patients the researchers created an anonymous survey which asked participants everything from the type of pubic grooming they did to the amount of sexual partners they had . <p> Surprisingly , the survey was very popular : more than 14,000 men and women took it , specifically detailing how they liked to trim the family hedge . <p> The participants were aged between 18 and 65 , most of them acknowledged that they had groomed themselves before , with women winning the tally at 84 percent compared to just 66 percent of men . <p> The researchers found that those who groomed frequently -- defined as 11 times or more in a calendar year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a greater number of sexual partners . <p> This in turn , brought with it an 80 percent increased chance of getting an STI . <p> While the researchers were busy spoiling everyone 's fun , they also asked about the specific utensils used . <p> Men were more likely to go for the quick and " good enough " route with an electric razor , but women were much more likely to take their time with a manual razor . <p> There was also a fairly large number of daredevils ( around one in five ) who preferred to use a steady hand and a pair of scissors . <p> If all of this has you worried about your next waxing appointment , you can relax : the researchers did not account for safe sex practices , which means if you keep it careful you likely do n't have anything to worry about . <h> What place does

In a nutshell ( literally ) , there are loads and loads of nutrients . <p> " Nuts and peanuts are high in fibre , magnesium , and polyunsaturated fats -- nutrients that are beneficial for cutting cardiovascular disease risk and which can reduce cholesterol levels , " Aune said . <p> " Some nuts , particularly walnuts and pecan nuts , are also high in antioxidants , which can fight oxidative stress and possibly reduce cancer risk . <p> " Even though nuts are quite high in fat , they are also high in fibre and protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually reduce your risk of obesity over time .

 hour of sleep doubles a driver 's crash risk <p> It 's hard to get a decent bit of shuteye when the nights are hot and muggy , but failing to meet the recommended eight hours of sleep a night might be putting your life at risk on the roads . <p> New research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the US has found that missing just an hour of sleep is enough to almost double your risk of having a car accident . <p> It 's estimated that the risk of being sleepy behind the wheel is so great that it 's comparable to driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 -- enough to put you over the legal limit in Australia . <p> " You can not miss sleep and still expect to be able to safely function behind the wheel , " says lead author of the study Dr David Yang . <p> " Our new research shows that a driver who has slept for less than five hours has a crash risk comparable to someone driving drunk . " <p> Releasing their results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more sleep you lost , the higher your risk of a crash became : <p> Driving on six to seven hours of sleep : 1.3 times the crash risk <p> Driving on five to six hours of sleep : 1.9 times the crash risk <p> Driving on four to five hours of sleep : 4.3 times the crash risk <p> Driving on less than four hours of sleep : 11.5 times the crash risk <p> Because being chronically tired is so widespread and so impossible to police the researchers stress that drivers should know the warning signs of being too drowsy to drive . <p> Although the most common symptoms of excessive drowsiness are obvious like heavy eyelids and " floating " in between lanes there 's also subtler signs , like not remembering the last couple of kilometres you 've driven . <p> As part of the study , the researchers conducted an enormous online poll to collect community opinions on whether drowsy driving was perceived as being dangerous . <p> Almost all drivers a huge 97 percent believed that drowsy driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they regularly drove when they were so tired they could n't keep their eyes open . <p> For Jake Nelson , the director of research at the AAA , it 's a sign that many people will prioritise everything else in life over getting a good night 's rest . <p> " Managing a healthy work-life balance can be difficult and far too often we sacrifice our sleep as a result , " says Nelson . <p> " Failing to maintain a healthy sleep schedule could mean putting yourself or others on the road at risk . " <p> If you 've got a long drive ahead of you thanks to the Christmas holidays , the Sleep Foundation recommends not to rely on listening to your body by the time you notice difficulty concentrating or sleepiness , it can be too late . <p> " Sleep is a powerful biological drive , and can overtake even the best driver . Rolling down the windows and turning up the volume of the radio are tricks that do n't work , " they write on their website . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in optimal driving shape is to plan ahead and get seven to eight hours of sleep before your drive . " <p> Other techniques to stay safe include driving with another person and taking shifts , pulling over to nap in a safe rest spot , and restricting driving during times that you 'd traditionally be asleep . <h> End-of-life care among 
 trial <p> With the average Australian spending 1.7 hours per day on Facebook , it 's clear that we 're pretty into our social media . <p> But is the sharing , liking and commenting helping foster good connections and improving our lives or does the constant clicking distract us from important real-life relationships and promote jealousy ? <p> We asked Professor Lea Waters from the University of Melbourne 's Centre for Positive Psychology to help us determine whether social media is delivering the mental health goods or if it 's time we log off . <h> The evidence for <p> In good news for those of us who are partial to a social media scroll , more often than not , we get a little feelgood buzz . <p> " The research shows that when people use Facebook in particular , 64 percent of the time they are likely to get off and feel position emotions , such as feeling connected , informed , entertained and happy for their friends reporting good news , " Professor Waters , who tweets at , told Coach . <p> Social media can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even those who you do n't know well . <p> " Seventy-two percent of users use social media to spread positive news and positive emotions have a ripple effect across the network , " Professor Waters says . <p> " What I put on Facebook , whether it 's positive or negative , influences the mood of people up to three degrees away . So my positive post can influence my friend and my friend 's friend . " <p> Social media has also been shown to inspire us to be more generous one study showed that people were more likely to donate to a cause if other people in their social network were donating . <p> " It 's not just emotions that go through social media , it 's cooperative behaviour as well , " Professor Waters points out . <p> " We see posts from people asking for donations for their friend who needs a new wheelchair and we see people putting a callout saying , ' I need a tent ' . " <p> We often hear about teenagers suffering bullying via social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media has the ability to enhance a shy teenagers ' sense of social connection . <p> " In face-to-face interaction they may feel a little awkward and ca n't read other people 's body language as quick as others but in a virtual relationship online , those things do n't matter in the exchange . For that subset of teenagers social media enhanced their sense of connection , " she explains . <p> Social media can also be a good way for groups of people with similar interests or life situations to get together . Professor Waters says teenagers with learning disabilities , such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , were found to be less lonely if they used social media . <p> " Often the medical system and educational system looks at the negatives and there is a stigma associated with ADHD but Facebook support groups look at positives , like , ' We are social and have heaps of energy ' , which helped to reduce their stigma , " Professor Waters says . <p> " That is further evidence to say it does more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evidence against <p> But for all of the potential good sides of social media , there are some downers too . <p> While we might feel good two thirds of the time after logging onto our social accounts , the research shows that 36 percent of the time we do n't feel so crash hot . <p> " The statistics tell us it 's not 100 percent positive 36 percent of the time we are likely to feel envy or frustrated , " Professor Water says . <p> Of course Professor Waters says our response to social media varies depending on our individual personality and our headspace on a given day . <p> " One factor is your level of self esteem generally speaking , people have better results from social media if they have a higher self esteem , " Professor Waters says . <p> " If you spend long amounts of time looking at other people 's lives and not living your own and are using it as an escape , it wo n't be particularly helpful for you . " <p> The amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The more time you spend on social media the fewer positive experiences you zone out and it zaps your energy , " Professor Waters says . <p> What your network is posting will also have a significant impact on your headspace . <p> " The research has shown that we have little social media hubs -- negative depressed people tend to gravitate towards each other , which happens in real life as well , " Professor Waters says . <p> " You might find yourself in a group where the norm is to always complain and it can be a bit of a downer . But if you 're in a network that is posting more positive news , you get off and you feel uplifted . " <h> The verdict <p> So should you use social media ? There are plenty of positives that come with using Facebook , Instagram , Snapchat and their kind but you need to keep tabs on how they 're affecting you . <p> " The deeper question people have to ask is , ' Why am I using social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Professor Waters says . <p> Curate a positive list of people , businesses and causes to follow , and if you notice you 're feeling envious or jealous then consider if you need to change who you 're following to make your feed more mood-enhancing . <p> " Monitor how much time you are on social media and choose your network wisely , " Professor Waters says . <p> " Actively seek out positive networks do n't just be a passive recipient of social media . If you get pleasure from seeing amazing photographers , go and seek out photographers on Instagram or travel writers . Be a little bit systematic and scientific . " <p> Team leader Ed

 a lifeline for those with mental health conditions <p> Coping with illnesses like depression , anxiety and stress can lead you down a complicated route of prescriptions and professionals -- but the most invaluable treatment may be a wagging tail or a cheery meow . <p> A new study from the Universities of Manchester and Southampton discovered that pets are the unsung heroes when it comes to treating people with mental health issues . <p> The reason why ? As the researchers speculate , it 's because animals are like the ultimate sounding board for patients : they provide physical comfort with a cuddle , they relieve loneliness and most importantly of all , they do not pass judgement . <p> ( Unless of course you forget to take them for walks or feed them ... then you 'll receive the judging of a lifetime . ) <p> For Dr Helen Brooks , a researcher who helped author the study , this finding is the first time science has recognised the role pets can play for those suffering from the effects of mental illness . <p> " The recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on particular salience for people living with a long-term mental health conditions , " writes Dr Brooks . <p> Of course , measuring how pets alleviate the symptoms of sadness and stress is n't as easy as you 'd think . <p> With 54 willing participants in the lab , the researchers set to work trying to " rate " just how happy a wet smooch from a Labrador was , or how comforting it was to have a purring kitty on your lap . <p> The researchers needed to set up two groups : long-term mental health patients who did have a pet , and a control group of patients who did n't have a pet . <p> Then the patients were effectively asked to rank their support networks in order of how important they are to managing their illnesses . <p> Up for consideration was everyone from the patient 's mental health support worker to their friends , social groups and even physical activities like gardening or listening to music . <p> Surprisingly , pets ranked extremely higher than expected , only being beaten by medical professionals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's found themselves whispering baby gibberish into the ear of their dog , cat , guinea pig or bird can attest to this . ) <p> " Pets helped their owners manage feelings by distracting them from symptoms and upsetting experiences such as hearing voices and suicide ideation and provided a form of encouragement for activity , " writes Dr Brooks . <p> " I was surprised though by the range and depth of roles pets played in the management of mental health problems from the perspectives of participants . " <p> While the researchers do n't advocate for every patient to run out to their nearest pet shop and purchase themselves a new friend for Christmas , they do believe it 's time we highlight how beneficial human-animal relationships can be for mental health . <h> The stories that 
 Man flu is a real thing <p> Men , it 's time to take a collective big deep breath in for an almighty " I told you so " , because it looks like the man flu may be a real thing after all . <p> Scientists from the University of London have discovered that men suffer more intense symptoms from viral infections than women -- but not for the reasons you think . <p> It is n't because men are " soft " or " weak " , it 's because the virus actively wants to spread itself to as many people as possible , and takes umbrage with the fact that men ca n't give birth . <p> Yes , it sounds absurd ( almost like viruses are some kind of cartoonish super villain ) , but lead researcher Professor Francisco Ubeda says it 's simply the virus 's way of ensuring its continued survival . <p> " Viruses may be evolving to be less dangerous to women , looking to preserve the female population , " says Ubeda . <p> " The reason why these illnesses are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed from mother to child , either through breastfeeding , or just through giving birth . " <p> Using mathematical modelling , the researchers were able to demonstrate that many women function as asymptomatic " hosts " for viruses , while men are more likely to be hit hard in the hope that their sneezing and coughing might pass it on to others . <p> Viruses that have a low fatality in women and high fatality in men are more likely to survive ( thanks to being passed on during childbirth ) than those who effect the sexes equally . <p> At a November 
 media sites you use , the higher your risk of depression <p> Do you only stick to Facebook or do you flit from Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat to Tumblr to Reddit to Twitter to ... ? Your answer could reveal a lot about your mental wellbeing . <p> A new analysis from the University of Pittsburgh has determined that people who report using seven to 11 social media platforms have more than three times the risk of depression and anxiety than those who use zero to two platforms . <p> Your initial reaction is probably " There are 11 social media platforms ? ! " . But it 's not a hard number to hit : the ones included in the study were Facebook , YouTube , Twitter , Instagram , Snapchat , Reddit , Tumblr , Pinterest , Vine , LinkedIn and Google Plus ( although who even uses Google Plus ) . <p> Participants in the study were all US adults aged between 19 to 32 . Researchers accounted for other factors that may contribute to depression and anxiety , including race , gender , relationship status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that using more social media sites makes you depressed and anxious the study 's author , Dr Brian Primack , cautioned that it might also be that depression and anxiety makes you more likely to use more social media sites . <p> " People who suffer from symptoms of depression or anxiety ... may be searching out multiple avenues for a setting that feels comfortable and accepting , " said Primack in a statement . <p> " However , it could also be that trying to maintain a presence on multiple platforms may actually lead to depression and anxiety . More research will be needed to tease that apart . " <p> However , Primack does have a couple of theories why using multiple social media sites could damage your mental health . <p> For starters , constant multitasking ( for example , monitoring your Instagram likes and your Snapchat story and stalking your ex 's new boyfriend on Facebook ) is known to be related to poor mental health outcomes . <p> And it might also be that navigating the complex unwritten rules of multiple social networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic faux pas , like thinking you 're searching for someone 's name on Facebook but accidentally typing it into your status instead ) adds to your stress . <p> Professor Lea Waters , from the University of Melbourne 's Centre for Positive Psychology , recently told Coach that social media is n't inherently bad it 's more how you approach it . <p> " The deeper question people have to ask is , ' Why am I using social media ? What do I get out of it ? ' " Professor Waters advised . <p> " Actively seek out positive networks do n't just be a passive recipient of social media . If you get pleasure from seeing amazing photographers , go and seek out photographers on Instagram or travel writers . Be a little bit systematic and scientific . " <p> But the memo

 'll take to lose the weight gained over Christmas <p> Those giant meals , second helpings of dessert , and endless glasses of beer and champagne you indulged in over Christmas could hang around your waistline till June . <p> June . That 's the conclusion of a recent study of holiday weight gain , which found it takes about five months for the average person 's weight to go back to what it was before big holiday seasons . <p> A team led by Cornell University 's Food and Brand Lab used wireless scales to record the weights of almost 3000 people in the United States , Germany and Japan . <p> Though the average weight-gain patterns varied by country , all the participants ' waistlines were hit hard by national holidays with Christmas the biggest culprit . <p> In all three countries , participants ' weight increased steadily in the days leading up to Christmas Day . In the 10 days after Christmas continued rising by an average 0.5 percent -- small , but enough to be significant and peaked around New Year 's Day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost shortly after the holiday , but the other half lingered for months : in the US , weight did n't go back to pre-Christmas levels until late April through to June . <p> Australia , being in the Southern Hemisphere , likely has its own annual pattern of weight gain but many of us are familiar with festive season weight gain that 's hard to shake . <p> " It 's easier to avoid holiday pounds than to lose them after they happen , " said the Food and Brand Lab 's director Brian Wansink ... which is not particularly helpful advice to hear now , after you already that whole plate of cookies you told the kids were for Santa . <p> Here 's some advice to get back on track post-Christmas : <p> Do n't beat yourself up . The worst thing you can do right now is tell yourself what a disgusting fat pig you are because you managed to build yourself a nest of Cadbury Favourites wrappers on Christmas Day . It 's okay to indulge once in a while , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to do next , instead of what you did . <p> Do n't punish yourself with an extreme diet . The second worst thing you can do is commit to only consuming steamed lettuce and lukewarm tea to make up for your Christmas binge . Extreme dieting usually ends in extreme bingeing . ( Also : do n't go on any sort of detox plan . Detoxing is BS . ) <p> Ease back into a healthy eating routine ASAP . It 's easy to say " I 'll get my diet back on track after New Year 's Day " , or " I 'll get my diet back on track when I go back to work " , then just put it off indefinitely . Aim to get it back on track today -- a good guideline is the 80:20 rule , where you try to eat well 80 percent of the time then go easy the other 20 percent . <p> Cut back your portion sizes . This is the easiest way to lose weight , because you do n't have to change what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stop eating your partner 's leftovers , cut yourself a slightly smaller slice of lasagne , or even order a regular Big Mac meal instead of a large . Gradually train your stomach to enjoy more manageable sizes , and you 'll consume less calories ( and therefore start to lose weight ) without even noticing . <p> Woolworths will use 
 how to start cooking all your food at once ( to smash your weight loss and fitness goals ) <p> On Instagram , you double-tap beautifully arranged containers of multicoloured foods . At work , you watch coworkers slide lovingly prepared meals into the microwave . In the gym , you admire svelte trainers tucking into their perfect combo of protein , carbs and fat . <p> What a workout plan is to fitness , is to nutrition . If you do n't have a plan of what you 're going to do when you exercise , you 'll likely end up wasting time and not hitting your goals -- ditto for if you 're not mealprepping . <p> From a practical standpoint , it makes a lot of sense to prepare a bunch of meals at once then pop them into storage containers until they 're ready to be eaten . For starters , it eliminates one of the classic #firstworldproblems : the excruciating burden of having to decide what to have for lunch every day . <p> It 's also cheaper : the cost of each pre-made meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot less than paying $7 minimum for a sandwich every day . <p> And it 's healthier : you 're not eating processed foods all the time , you can precisely manage your portion sizes , and it more or less traps you into eating well -- because if you do n't eat your foods , you 're throwing away money you 've already spent . <p> The downside of : if you prepare , say , five meals in advance , then you 're stuck eating the same thing for the next five lunches . " Do n't you get bored eating the same thing all the time ? " Yeah , sometimes -- but the benefits of outweigh the boredom . It might help if you think of as your " fuel " food , and your other meals as your " fun " food . <p> First you need to decide when you 're going . This could be any time during the week , but Sundays are the most common ( is a big hashtag for a reason ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll likely need to set aside an hour or two each time which seems like a lot , but it 's time you 'll regain later in the week . <p> Next you need to decide what you 're going to mealprep . You need to figure out how many meals you 're going to make and what foods will go into them ( this will depend on your own health goals ) , and you need to know all this before you hit the supermarket . Tossing a bunch of random stuff into your trolley and hoping for the best is n't a great strategy . <p> Your could be something as basic and grilled chicken and broccoli , or it could be a multi-layered concoction you pulled from Pinterest . <p> Whatever you decide to make , here 's an important tip : start simple . If you 're new to mealprep , do n't leap straight into burrito bowls with 27 ingredients and handmade sushi rolls . <p> Keep it basic until you work your way up to expert level , and choose things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fridge or freezer . ( I have experimented with waaaaay too many recipes that turned into grey sludge by the end of the week . ) <p> Once you start to level up , you can match your to your preferred macros . If you have no idea what " macros " are , do n't stress ( FYI , it 's your macronutrient ratio ) just try to make sure your meals all include some protein , some healthy fats and some good carbs . <p> Not a lot , but there are some bits and pieces that will make the whole process easier : a kitchen scale is extremely handy , while slow cookers or crockpots were practically invented for . <p> It 's essential to have containers to store all these meals in . Coles and Woolies both sell plastic takeaway-style containers in their storage aisle . Make sure they 're BPA-free , microwave safe , and clear so you can see what 's inside them at a glance . ( Nothing worse than getting to work and realising you accidentally packed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might consider investing in more durable containers , such as this glass one from Kmart ( $5 each ) , or containers with built-in partitions if you 're preparing something with ingredients that need to be kept separate . <p> To make it easier to cart these containers around when they 're laden with food , it 's advisable to buy a small zip-up cooler bag , which will cost anywhere from $8 to $15 . You can find something perfect in the camping section of Kmart , Target or Big W ... or just get a kid 's lunchbox , if you 're not embarrassed to tote around something with bright colours or patterns . <p> You need a fair bit of space in your fridge to store all those containers , so clear out those expired yoghurts and half-empty jars of pasta sauce before you start cooking . <h> What else do I need to know ? <p> Condiments are a 's best friend . Tabasco or chilli or pesto or or pepper lemon juice or even olive oil are excellent at reanimating boring or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marinades are your second best friend . ) <p> The first couple of times you , the whole process might feel like it takes . Fear not ! Eventually you will become a frighteningly efficient multitasker who knows exactly when this goes into the oven as that comes out , and the process gets way faster . Use the timer on your phone to keep yourself on track . <p> You might also find that whatever you 've made does n't keep well with other things it 's stored with , or tastes real bad by the end of the week . That 's fine -- is all about experimentation and finessing until you find something that works . <p> ( Experimentation within reason , that is -- is not the best time to try a recipe you 've never attempted before , as I discovered on the ill-fated occasion I successfully made a kangaroo peanut satay mess. ) <p> At first glance 
 it 's both good travel advice and good health advice . <p> The Mediterranean diet with its focus on fruits , vegetables , whole grains and olive oil , a moderate allowance of delights including wine , fish and cheese has been linked to a range of benefits to your cardiovascular health . <p> According to a new study , it 's also good for your brain as you advance into old age : research published in the journal Neurology suggests that a Mediterranean diet prevents older people 's brains from shrinking . <p> The study 's author , Dr Michelle Luciano of the University of Edinburgh , explained that brain shrinkage is an inevitable part of ageing . <p> " We lose brain cells which can affect learning and memory , " she said in a statement . <p> To test the effect of the Mediterranean diet on brain size , Luciano 's research team surveyed the diet habits of almost 1000 Scottish people aged around 70 , none of whom had dementia . <p> Three years later , more than half those participants had their brain volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than three-quarters returned for a second MRI . <p> Those whose diets stuck more closely to the principles of the Mediterranean diet showed , on average , half the brain shrinkage as those who did n't -- even after other factors that influence brain shrinkage , such as age , education , diabetes or high blood pressure , were ruled out . <p> Luciano 's research did n't determine whether it 's specific parts of the Mediterranean diet that bring these brain benefits , or whether it 's the whole diet working in combination . <p> " The Mediterranean diet may be able to provide long-term protection to the brain , " said Luciano . " Still , larger studies are needed to confirm these results . " <h> I met a 
 happier any kind of movement <p> It 's well established exercise is such an effective mood booster it can be used as a tool to treat depression . But it 's not just exercise that can make you happier , it 's movement all movement . <p> One of the largest studies of its kind , led by researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of Essex , has shown that any level of physical activity can have a positive effect on emotional wellbeing . <p> " There have been many studies about the positive psychological effects of exercise , " said the paper 's senior author Dr Jason Rentfrow , from Cambridge 's Department of Psychology , in a statement . <p> " But what we 've found is that in order to be happier , you do n't have to go out and run a marathon all you 've really got to do is periodically engage in slight physical activity throughout the day . " <p> They 're not kidding when they say " slight " : study co-author Dr Gillian Sandstrom , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said even totally basic activity like " walking from the desk to the photocopier , or from the car to the office door " counts towards your mood . <p> The study tracked 10,000 everyday people who had downloaded a free mood-tracking app for Android phones . <p> Twice a day the app surveyed users about their mood , asking them to rate themselves on a graph of positive-to-negative and , as well as quizzing them on their emotional states and general life satisfaction . <p> The app also collected self-reported data about each user 's physical activity , and measured the user 's movement patterns using the phone 's in-built accelerometer ( which is harder to cheat ) . <p> When all this data was used to calculate happiness scores for each user , it was found that participants with higher levels of activity throughout their day reported a more positive emotional state . <p> " Our data show that happy people are more active in general , " said Dr <h> Sewer fund re-allocation 
 <h> Science of the sauna : Why sweating it up might be more beneficial than you think <p> What you think about saunas depends largely on where you 've grown up : here in Australia they 're largely seen as the domain of the gym 's creepy old men , but in Finland they 're revered as an almost spiritual experience . <p> ( Considering the Finns boast a population of just 5 million , it 's fair to say they know a thing or two about sweating it up in the nude . ) <p> The average Finn has a sauna session about once a week , and before the circulation of healthcare programs many Finnish mothers gave birth in saunas thanks to the largely sterile environment . To them , a sauna is invigorating for both mental and physical health . <p> But is the art of steaming yourself like a piece of broccoli simply some weird northern European throwback , or can it actually improve your health ? <p> According to Aidan Rich , APA sports physiotherapist , the sauna sort of straddles the line between cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing a lot of promise . <p> " Sauna use appears to be quite low risk , particularly if there are no other serious health conditions , " Rich tells Coach . <p> " There are many potential benefits such as heart health , improved endurance , as well as the social and relaxation benefits that a sauna may offer . <p> " Aside from these , sauna use may give a feeling of relaxation , or enjoyable social interaction , which may account for the ' feel good ' effect that people experience after using a sauna . " <p> Of course , Rich is quick to point out that you can not simply recommend everybody to immediately jump into the sauna , because ( surprise surprise ) sitting in a small room as hot as 80 degrees Celsius is not going to agree with everyone . <p> " Sauna or extreme heat exposure can potentially be dangerous , particularly when undertaken for prolonged periods , with any form of exercise , or unsupervised , " warns Rich . <p> " It 's recommended that you discuss with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> It 's more strenuous than you might imagine <p> For most Australians , sitting in the sauna is something that you would only do after a hard session in the gym or a leisurely swim in some upmarket hotel pool . <p> In almost all cases , sauna use is seen as a form of recovery where you can recharge and refresh , but Rich says this is a common misconception amongst gym goers . <p> " Sauna exposure should be seen as an additional training stress , " explains Rich . <p> " Using a sauna has been shown to provide similar benefits to regular exercise , such as lower resting heart rate , higher red blood cell count , and better core temperature regulation during exercise . " <p> That 's right stripping off to spend a period of time in a hot wooden room is just about the only way you can increase your athletic performance while sitting on your butt , but Rich says it 's important not to go overboard . <p> " Sauna training exposure can be used as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a walk , ride , swim , run -- and resistance or weight training , " says Rich . " The best times to use a sauna would be on an ' easy ' or light training day . <p> " A sauna really should n't be used on a hard training day , when instead priority should be given to more traditional recovery methods such as eating well or light stretching after intense exercise . " <h> The detox myth <p> Many people believe that a session in the sauna allows your body to remove toxins from your blood by sweating them out , and it 's a claim that many celebrities are fond of making , <p> Sadly , Rich explains there 's no evidence behind the detoxifying nature of the sauna it turns out that your kidneys and liver do a fine job of that as it is . <p> " Unfortunately the sauna and toxins theory has been debunked by research ! " says Rich . <p> " However with all of the other benefits of sauna use or heat exposure , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How to use a sauna <p> So it turns out that saunas can be pretty damn helpful , especially if you find them relaxing . But getting the most out of a steam room is n't as simple as plopping yourself down on a wooden bench and staying until even your ears have pruned up . <p> According to Rich , there are several ways that have been proven in research to help fast-track the benefits of sauna , and almost all of them involve taking regular breaks . <p> " Several short periods for example , two to three visits each lasting three to five minutes have been shown to be a relaxation tool , " says Rich . <p> " It 's possible that even short , regular exposure to heat has positive effects on longevity , and heart disease , although the exact relationships between heat exposure and these outcomes are still being investigated . " <p> If jumping in and out every couple of minutes sounds like too much hassle ( especially when you 're near-nude ) , then longer stretches can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-30 minutes appears to have significant benefits such as improved endurance in sport , decreased muscle breakdown when weight training , and improved blood sugar control , " explains Rich . <p> For the hardcore types , there 's even some evidence that pulling the bench press into the sauna could supercharge your strength although you would n't want to be caught dead doing it in your local gym . <p> " Exercise in the sauna , or another hot environment , is another way that 's been recommended , " says Rich . <p> " There is some research currently underway in New Zealand that is investigating doing weight training in a very hot environment . <p> " It appears that lifting lighter weights in a hot environment may give the same strength benefit as lifting heavy weights in a normal temperature environment , but without as much muscular soreness and fatigue .

 <h> Hate yoga ? Why you might want to give it a second chance <p> Make a #yoga search and you 'll find millions of Instagram posts of lithe people bending or finding Zen it 's no wonder that people all over the world are pulling on their Lululemons in a bid to get slim , agile and peaceful . <p> But trying yoga can be another experience altogether . Many yoga newbies complain of feeling uncoordinated , stiff , sore or bored , then wonder what 's wrong with them and why they 're not feeling the yogi love that proponents of the ancient Indian modality go on about . <p> " The idea of yoga is to be Zen and at peace with oneself . If you were to say yoga is not for me , it can be interpreted as saying being at peace with oneself is not important to you , " Pia Therese , real body coach and founder of Melbourne Fitness and Wellbeing , told Coach . <p> On top of that , yoga can be really hard both physically and mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rolling out a mat . <p> " People think yoga is beautiful and easy and great for the mind but do n't realise there is often a lot of strength required , " Therese says . <p> " Some types of yoga require you to hold the pose for quite a long time and that requires a lot of core strength and requires your mind to be in the right spot to hold the pose . " <p> As for the mental side of things , Therese says a lot of people judge themselves if they 're not completely " in the moment " for the entire 60 or 90-minute class which is not necessarily the goal . <p> " If you manage to spend 10 seconds with complete immersion in what you are doing then that 's great that is 10 seconds of the day you would n't normally have been so focused , " Therese says . <p> Dustin Brown from Warrior One Yoga says there is a yoga style for everyone and encourages people to try different styles and teachers until they find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it boring potentially have n't found the right teacher , " he says . <p> " There is vinyasa , yin , hip hop , acro , naked , bro yoga and heaps of others they all attract different people for different reasons . It 's about finding the right teacher and place that does n't feel intimidating so you feel at home . " <p> If you 're interested in becoming more yogi , Brown suggests getting clear on what you want to get out of it . <p> If you want to build strength and have a bit of a workout then vinyasa or ashtanga might be for you . If you want to release tight muscles after a lot of running or high intensity workouts then you might try a Yin or Yoga Tune-Up class to stretch and release the muscles . <p> Teachers also vary dramatically and who appeals to your friend wo n't necessarily have the right vibe for you . <p> But regardless of whether they 're a calming soul or someone who pumps you up , Brown says a good teacher should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your mat you are in your own sanctuary , free from judgment it 's your time to just be there , " he says . <p> " Noone is looking at you -- they are thinking about their own journey on their mat . " <p> But if you 've tried a bunch of classes and still do n't feel it 's for you , then Greg Stark , exercise physiologist and author of Sweat Equity , says you do n't have to do yoga . <p> " Yoga is great and I see a lot of value in it but it 's not the only way to get increased mobility and flexibility or de-stress and slow down , " he says . <p> " For some people running can have a meditative aspect to it -- they breathe deeply and clear their mind . For others running is strenuous and stressful and has the opposite effect , so it 's about finding what works for you . " <p> But regardless of whether you do yoga or stretching and lengthening in a different format , Stark says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too stiff and sore . <p> " You can increase your performance with increases in mobility , " he points out . <p> " If yoga gets you moving and you enjoy it , then that 's a great outcome . But maybe all you need is to create pauses in your day to find calmness. " 
 <h> Nobody panic , but Friday the 13th could be bad for your health <p> 2017 includes two rounds of Friday the 13th : one in January and a second in October . While there 's no proven rise in ladders falling on people who walk under them or cranky black cats scratching up people 's faces , a study published in the British Medical Journal indicates the date does carry a higher risk of misfortune . <p> In 1993 , researchers analysed people 's movement patterns in the south west Thames region of England on Friday the 13th and the preceding , Friday the 6th . <p> The researchers pored over the number of vehicles on the roads , the number of people who dared venture to the supermarket , and the number of people admitted to hospitals . <p> The number of supermarket shoppers was n't markedly different on either day ( when you need milk , you need milk ) . But there were " consistently and significantly fewer vehicles " on the M25 motorway on Friday the 13th and spookily , despite there being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport accidents rose " significantly " . <p> " Friday the 13th is unlucky for some , " wrote the study 's authors . " The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent . <p> " Staying at home is recommended , " they concluded . <p> Research carried out in 2002 came to a similar and equally hair-raising finding , determining that Finnish women ( but not Finnish men ) were way more likely to die in traffic accidents on Friday the 13th . <p> " Friday the 13th may be a dangerous day for women , largely because of anxiety from superstition , " wrote the researchers -- meaning that it 's not the date itself that 's inherently unlucky , but possibly that expectations of unluckiness create a self-fulfilling and sometimes fatal prophecy . <h> But it 's not all doom and gloom <p> According to the Australian Road Deaths Database , in 2016 there were five fatalities on Australian roads on Friday , May 13 , compared to just one the preceding Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Friday the 13th struck three times in 2015 : in February there were three fatalities on the 13th , two on the 6th and five on the 20th ; in March there were five on the 13th , none on the 6th and seven on the 20th ; and in November there were three on the 13th , six on the 6th , and five on the 20th . <p> So it 's pretty hard to argue Friday the 13th is particularly unlucky . ( The data for 2014 and 2013 reveals a similar trend or rather , lack of any trend . ) <p> And wider studies have determined that there really is n't any higher risk of misfortune , injury or death on Friday the 13th . <p> A 2002 study that looked emergency department admission rates in US hospitals found that " average ED visits for Friday the 13th were not increased compared with the Friday before and after and the month before " . <p> Of the 13 categories of admissions , 12 of them had no notable rise on Friday the 13th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eek ! ) , which maybe indicates those Friday the 13th slasher movies are n't as fictional as you 'd hope . <p> " Friday the 13th should not be any different than any other day , " argued those researchers . <p> And deeper analysis of traffic fatalities on Finland 's roads in 2004 determined that , actually , Finnish female motorists are n't any more likely to die on Friday the 13th than any other day a finding reinforced in 2008 by Dutch insurance statisticians , who revealed there fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft on the supposedly unlucky day . <p> But if you 're still nervous about what series of unfortunate events might befall you on Friday the 13th , what should you do ? Well , the authors of that 2004 researcher have some advice for the superstitious . <p> " People who are anxious of Black Friday may stay home , " they wrote . " Or at least avoid driving a car . " 
 <h> The unexpected health benefits of getting a rescue dog <p> Forget buying a Thighmaster 5000 off the telly or attaching those vibrating pads to your belly if you really want to get fit without even trying , you might be best off rescuing a dog . <p> According to recent research by Medibank , Aussies who own a dog are 96 percent more likely to exercise than those who do n't , with most owners getting an astonishing four hours extra exercise a week . <p> According to health guru and trainer Michelle Bridges who has her own rescue dog , six-year-old Paddy the benefits of homing a hound go far beyond your physical health . <p> " I absolutely love having Paddy in my life , " Bridges tells Coach . " He just brings so much joy and so much unconditional love the mental health benefits are just enormous . <p> " When you have a tough day at work and you 're feeling a little anxious , all it takes is a cuddle and pat with him to have everything float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sloppy lick is n't the typical treatment for those suffering from chronic stress , but experts are beginning to believe that dogs hold the power to recuperating those suffering from mental health illnesses . <p> In 2005 researchers from Massey University in New Zealand discovered that owning a pet increased your lifespan , lowered your risk of loneliness , increased your daily exercise and even lowered your blood pressure . <p> " The physical benefits of owning a dog are just enormous . They just live for going on walks I know Paddy does and when you see their face it really does motivate you to go outside and get moving , " says Bridges . <p> " Not only do you get into the habit of doing this every day , you 're also meeting new people at the dog park , and you 're getting outside . I think there really is n't a downside at all . " <p> For someone looking to sculpt a magazine cover-worthy physique , walking the dog becomes a nice little piece of active recovery but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone hit the gym for an hour ) it could be an absolute lifesaver . <p> " Taking the dog for a walk is totally incidental exercise where often you do n't even realise you 're moving your body , " says Bridges . <p> " If you 're working a desk job or somewhere where you sit for long periods , getting out for a walk with the dogs could be literally the only exercise you get that day in that case it becomes absolutely critical . " <p> As an ambassador of Medibank 's campaign , Bridges is urging Aussies who have the space , time and patience to own a dog to consider adopting one from a rescue home . 
 <h> Sick of chicken ? Here 's 13 weird foods surprisingly high in protein <p> If you 're looking to build muscle , the amount of protein you need to be eating can appear to be a little daunting for some - especially if they 're planning to get it all from chicken and whey . Luckily , there 's an entire world out there of protein-packed foods that do n't quite get the same press . Take edamame beans for example - in just one cup of cooked beans there 's a whopping 22 grams of protein , making them a perfect post-workout snack . 
 <h> No , breakfast probably is n't the most important meal of the day . Yes , you should eat it anyway . <p> " Breakfast is the most important meal of the day . " It 's been drilled into you since childhood you must start the day with a solid meal to give you energy , lose weight , and ensure Earth continues rotating around the sun . <p> Writer Candice Choi 's article explores how much of the " science " that proves breakfast 's importance is n't particularly scientific after all -- and some of the pro-breakfast research was sponsored by cereal makers . <p> Because of the lack of solid evidence , the US government stopped recommending breakfast for weight loss when its dietary guidelines were updated in 2015 , though the Australian government still stands behind breakfast in its dietary guidelines . <p> Which is all likely to leave the average person thinking : " So am I supposed to eat my darn breakfast or not ? ! " <p> Short answer : Yes , it 's better to eat breakfast than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Breakfast is pretty important as part of an overall balanced diet , " Lauren McGuckin , accredited practicing dietitian from All About Balance , explains to Coach . " If you 're skipping it , it 's a missed opportunity for nutrients our bodies need . " <p> And kind of like how you 'll rip out less hair if you take time to read the instructions before assembling Ikea furniture , you 'll set yourself up for a better day if you eat breakfast before you get started . <p> " Good quality carbohydrates help with cognition and concentration , " says McGuckin , meaning both adults and kids will get a brain boost . <p> " Some protein will keep your appetite at bay , so you 're less likely to snack and graze . And you 're keeping your blood sugar levels more stable " making you less likely to get hangry and victimise your friends and coworkers . <h> What a dietitian eats for breakfast <p> McGuckin points out that most breakfast research only looks into breakfast cereals -- but cereal is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced and varied breakfast that draws from many -- or all -- food groups , not just the cereal one . <p> On leisurely mornings , her favourite breakfast is " wholegrain toast , a couple of poached eggs and smushed avocado " , often with a side of spinach , cooked mushrooms , and cherry tomatoes grilled in the oven until they blister . <p> On days when McGuckin has less time ( which , as the mum of an eight-month-old , is most of them ) , her staple is fruit and yoghurt -- frozen berries or seasonal fruits , with full-cream Greek yoghurt and some added extras . <p> " I put a bit of oat bran , wheat germ or LSA meal over the top of the yoghurt to add a bit of roughage , a bit of fibre , " she explains . <p> " That breakfast gets me right through to lunch . I do n't even think about snacking because it 's so satisfying . " <h> What a dietitian avoids for breakfast <p> It 's not uncommon to see people strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of energy drink and you do n't need a nutrition degree to know that is n't a healthy breakfast . <p> But McGuckin cautions that many breakfasts you might think are healthy are packed with a " surprising " amount of added sugar including most boxed cereals , particularly mueslis , and low-fat yoghurts . <p> Other cereals might have less sugar , but are so processed that all the nutrition has been squeezed out of them . <p> " Rice Bubbles are just air , there 's really nothing to them , " says McGuckin . " As soon as you put milk on them they go soggy . The stomach does n't have to do any work to digest it , so you 're hungry not long after . " <h> Breakfast haters gon na hate <p> " This is all very well and good , " that average person might now be thinking , " but I hate breakfast . " <p> McGuckin says it 's " massively common " to encounter people who insist they ca n't eat first thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is , it is possible to train yourself to become a breakfast eater . The bad news is , it 's a tough job . <p> " People who have never been breakfast eaters are going to really struggle to start eating it , " she says . " It 's not just simply about finding something you feel like eating then mustering up the guts to eat it . It 's about arranging your morning so that you 've got the time to do it . " <p> If you still ca n't join the breakfast club , there 's always intermittent fasting where you start your meals later in the day . Or you could try a bowl of zoats . Maybe it 'll convert you . 
 <h> Day in the life of a pro tennis player <p> The oldschool Wimbledon crowd would likely be appalled , but these days tennis players prep for their matches with gangster rap . <p> Up-and-coming player Lizette Cabrera , a Queenslander who made her grand slam debut in the 2017 Australian Open as a wildcard , explains that music is a big part of getting her " hyped " before she heads on the court . <p> The rest of the Queenslander 's training routine is less shocking . Cabrera an ambassador for Blackmores , an official partner of the Australian Open says she focuses on movement and strength , fuelling her body with favourites including Greek yoghurt and good ol ' . <p> The 19-year-old adds that headspace is an important shortcut to results , explaining that working on her mental state has had a significant impact on her physical game . 
 <p> " If people have high blood pressure and are adequately treated , then it really stops being a cause for concern . " <p> Blood pressure has only been on the radar of doctors and public health officials for the past 50 years or so . <p> " During the Second World War , US President Franklin Roosevelt had very high blood pressure and died shortly after the was as a consequence of that , " Professor Marwick points out . <p> " It 's really only in the 1950s that well-tolerated medications because available for managing blood pressure . " <p> The trouble with high blood pressure is that it 's relatively symptom free the only way you can usually tell if you 're at risk is if you have your doctor put one of those inflatable cuffs on your arm to measure it . <p> And if it 's high , you 'll be told to consume less salt , do more exercise and lose a bit of weight . If that 's to no avail , then you 'll have to take blood pressure medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters <p> In short , the heart is an intermittent pump that works by sucking blood in , contracting , then pushing blood out . The suck in and the push out create two different pressures in our circulation , and represent the two numbers you get for a blood pressure reading . <p> " There are literally miles and miles of blood vessels , which are tubes , in our body , " Professor Marwick says . <p> " When you send fluid down a tube there is some friction called resistance and to overcome that resistance , you have to give the blood some pressure to begin with . <p> " If the pressure gets very high suddenly then it 's possible for one of the arteries to burst -- just like blowing a balloon too much would pop the balloon . If that happens in the brain for example , it can lead to a haemorrhagic stroke . " <p> Our blood pressure changes naturally throughout the day , but when it 's consistently high , then it can increase your risk of heart attack , stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under 120/80mmHg ( which stands for millimetres of mercury and is a standard measurement for pressure ) . High blood is usually upwards of 140/90mmHg . <h> High blood pressure promoters <p> Professor Marwick says experts are n't entirely certain of the cause of high blood pressure in the majority of cases , however there are clear links to being overweight , not exercising and consuming too much salt . 
 <h> Primal fitness : Why Iron Zuu is set to dominate 2017 <p> Between sets of " frog squats " , he bellows out motivational messages about life touching on everything from taking ownership of your body to becoming a role model for your family . <p> " You 've got to appreciate your body ! " thunders Helberg . " If we were in battle and taking fire , I would n't politely ask you to move out of the way to save you -- I would push you ! " <p> Welcome to the world of Iron Zuu the newest workout craze that blends mobility , lung-scorching conditioning and an almost spiritual amount of teamwork . <p> As the name implies , Iron Zuu borrows much of its philosophy from creatures other than humans : in a standard class you 'll find yourself squatting like a frog , crawling like a bear and jumping like a gorilla . <p> Despite sounding more like an Attenborough-inspired doco than a workout , Helberg insists that it 's just a catchy name and the animal moves are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training : the lack of time spent on injury prevention . <p> " The process of practicing Zuu has taken me around 10 years . My wife came up with the name because she thought I looked like an animal as I crawled around in the backyard , " Helberg tells Coach . <p> " I soon realised that the pinnacle of all training , the real apex , is injury prevention . That is what Zuu is about . That is gold in my world . <p> " If you fell down the stairs , would you be prepared ? If you break your arm , that 's six months of incredibly hard recovery . During that whole time , you 're not getting better you 're just getting back to where you started . " <p> After attending a workout myself , I 'm convinced that it will soon rival the dizzying success of the more established " fitness cults " like CrossFit and F45 . <p> Despite not being as photogenic ( it 's honestly very hard to look sexy while you 're imitating a toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't go 30 seconds without having a stranger pat you on the back and urge you to work harder . <p> It 's what Helberg describes as " culture " , and within minutes you 'll find yourself swept up in the vibe of the workout , inexplicably making guttural noises as you scramble across the floor on all fours . <p> " At Zuu , we build culture before anything else . Without the culture , we are just people in a room trying out a different training style , " explains Helberg . <p> " But when we 're hooping and hollering and motivating each other , we are forming bonds that help the human spirit to thrive . " <p> The way Helberg creates this " culture " within a room is pretty simple : in between sets of bear crawls or fiendishly difficult " kick sits " , everyone forms a circle and runs in to get three " touches " . <p> ( It 's not what you 're thinking a " touch " is just a sweaty high-five . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass another member of the class , you are required to pat them on the back and urge them on . <p> It 's awkward at first -- especially if you are a fairly reserved person but soon you 're so fatigued by the burning lactic acid in your shoulders and quads that a pat on the back is the only thing keeping you going . <p> " Put your hands up who felt someone pat them on the back with encouragement , " Helberg asks the class mid-session . " Keep your hand up if you did n't know who they were . <p> " Now keep your hand up if you appreciated it . " <p> ( Needless to say , every hand was in the air . ) <p> Admittedly , it does sound all a little bit cult-ish , but Helberg insists that you do n't have to drink the Kool-Aid to realise that we need to spend more time on preventing injuries instead of creating them . <p> " I 'm not trying to convert people to Zuu I 'm trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " While I 've never seen people use some of the exercises we use in Zuu , I do know that they 're not new . We 're not reinventing the wheel , we 're strengthening it . " <p> The movement that Helberg refers to is mostly found in the hip capsule . <p> As we jumped , skipped and crawled our way around the room , our hips were always the focus and considering the average Aussie spends almost their entire life in an office chair or a car seat , it 's very often a case of tight hips that leads people to hurting their backs . <p> " Before I started practising Zuu , I was a powerlifter and at least 30 kilos heavier , " explains Helberg . <p> " Traditional training techniques had robbed me of my movement . I was stiff . I realised that if you ca n't move in the first place , and then you suddenly start loading the body with heavy weights , you 're only a stone 's throw away from injury . " <p> Unlike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign over your entire training schedule many of the principles can be adapted to suit what you enjoy doing in the gym the most . <p> " Think of your training like you 're building a house . Zuu is just about movement in my world it is the concrete slab upon which you build everything else , " explains Helberg . <p> Yes , taking part in an Iron Zuu class does require you to look a little silly you 'll get an intimate view of the person 's bum in front of you ( sometimes a blessing ) but the benefits of being able to use your body without pain makes it worth it . <p> " Zuu is not about this , " says Helberg , mimicking someone taking a series of selfies . <p> " It 's about helping people . About helping mums and dads pick up their kids , about helping powerlifters move their body , about helping soldiers rescue their teammates in battle . " 
 <h> The real highlight of the Federer/Nadal final ? Their shoes <p> If you tuned into the Australian Open this year , you were likely captivated by two things : firstly , some legendary tennis , and secondly , some brightly coloured footwear popping against Melbourne Park 's blue courts . <p> Many players , including Aussies Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios , appeared in pink or pinkish-orange footwear , and the trend climaxed at the men 's singles final where Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal both played in electric Nike shoes and black socks trimmed with neon . <p> Though the pair 's shoes looked identical to those sitting courtside or watching on TV , they 're not actually the same make . <p> The differences between the two are subtle , but important ( at least to kick aficionados ) . Federer , who plans his on-court looks up to a year and a half in advance , told Vogue that he favours " details and bold colours " . ( Luckily the Australian Open 's organisers are n't as fastidious as Wimbeldon 's , who banned Federer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking to copy the champions ' footwear , Federer 's shoes retail for US$180 and Nadal 's for US$165 . Both are lightweight shoes specifically designed for tennis . <p> The pair 's exact socks are n't yet available on Nike 's online store ( sad news for those of us keen to steal their look ) but the closest you 'll get is the NikeGrip Elite Crew tennis sock , which does n't quite have the same pop in the current colours the Elite Crew all-orange sock , worn by other players in the tournament , is currently sold out . <p> Nadal and Federer both have sponsorship deals with Nike estimated to be worth at least US$10 million per year not bad when you consider most everyday athletes would happily be kitted out with Nike swag for free . <p> Do n't be surprised if you see more bright orange-pink kicks in the gym or at your local tennis court . Coach has reached out to Nike to investigate whether Nadal and Federer have contributed to a boost in sales or interest . 
 <h> Do n't hate the spud : why the potato should return to your plate <p> More people are gradually realising carbs are n't the dietary demon they were made out to be -- but as grains , bread and pasta make a comeback to our plates , we should n't forget the humble potato , writes sports nutritionist Abby Shaw . <p> Why is a potato the first thing people cut out when losing weight ? ! So many times I hear clients tell me : " So I have stopped eating potatoes at dinner time and I am going no carb . " <p> Sorry to burst your bubble , but it is probably not the potato that made you gain the extra few kilograms . My guess is it is what you are putting on the potato , or maybe how you are cooking the potato , or that the potato in fact been turned into French fries . Please do n't blame the spud ! <p> Potatoes have been blamed for contributing to obesity , cardiovascular disease and diabetes . The main reason for this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips ( or crisps ) -- foods that are high in fat and contain a number of unhealthy components . French fries are also frequently associated with fast food . <p> What we tend to forget is that whole potatoes are a valuable source of nutrients including a range of vitamins , minerals and dietary fibre . They contain 10 percent or more of the recommended dietary intake ( RDI ) of vitamin C , thiamine , niacin , pantothenic acid and potassium . <h> How can you include potatoes in a healthy diet ? <p> Eating potatoes in a balanced diet should not be feared , as they add nutrients to your diet . <p> Eating a balanced diet , as whole food ( such as a whole potato with the skin on ) and cutting out a lot of processed foods/sugar will help you with your weight management . <p> Here are some tips from ( the site of New Zealand 's potato industry ) on how to prepare potatoes : <p> Cook them with the skin on . <p> Avoid chopping potatoes leave them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leach nutrients . <p> Bake or microwave them to avoid nutrient loss <p> Use herbs , garlic or pepper in place of salt . <p> Use vegetable oils in place of fats which are solid at room temperature . When roasting potatoes leave the skin on , cook separately from meat and drizzle with oil , or use an oil spray . <p> Choose colourful varieties of potato , which have high levels of phenolics and contain anthocyanins , both of which have antioxidant activity . They also have higher concentrations of some other nutrients such as folate . <p> Avoid green potatoes as they can contain glycoalkaloids . Glycoalkaloids are considered toxic , although there is still considerable debate about this . There is some evidence that glycoalkaloids may actually have health benefits . However , until there is more evidence it is best to avoid consuming green potatoes . <h> How potatoes can help with weight loss <p> When it comes to weight loss and nutrition , people tend to look at things to remove from their diet first , rather than making small changes to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to think about adding whole foods to your diet first rather than eliminating food groups . <p> The best success that I have had with clients is when they make small changes to their diet over time . It does n't mean you have to cull the spud , but maybe have less butter on it and leave the skin on it . <p> Another tip is to cook then cool the spud so it becomes loaded with resistant starch , a unique kind of carbohydrate that 's been shown to naturally rev up your body 's fat-burning process . Like fiber , you ca n't digest or absorb resistant starch , so your body ferments it when it reaches the large intestine , which triggers your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates . A pretty nice bonus ! <p> Yes potatoes , particularly peeled potatoes , have a high glycemic index meaning they might dramatically impact your blood sugar , and after eating a high-glycemic meal , your blood sugar and insulin rise higher than they do after eating low-glycemic fare . However balancing a meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can reduce this effect . <h> A bonus reason to feast on potatoes <p> Potatoes play a major role in feeding the world as they are one of the largest crops . They are an efficient plant as 85 percent of what grows can be eaten . Other crops , like rice , wheat and maize are less efficient with only about 50 percent of the plant being eaten . <p> Studies considering the carbon footprint of potatoes show potatoes produce less greenhouse gas than most other foods -- research published in Scientific American shows that , weight for weight , potatoes generate 57 times less greenhouse gases than beef and 13 times less than chicken . They also grow in a wide variety of conditions so are available all year round to feed us. 
 <p> This obviously presents itself as a physical problem : the less they move , the fatter our kids get . <p> But scientists are beginning to discover that daily exercise has the power to do so much more than keep young bodies slim it could actively prevent and treat mental illnesses . <p> New research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology suggests that young kids who are physically active are far less likely to be depressed than their sedentary friends . <p> We 've long known that exercise and healthy eating could be the key to treating depression in adults , but it 's never been conclusively proven to have the same effect on children until now . <p> " Being active , getting sweaty and roughhousing offer more than just physical health benefits , " says lead author and PhD candidate Tonje Zahl . " They also protect against depression . " <p> To gain a better understanding of how kicking a ball around the backyard or riding a bike could improve a child 's mental health , Zahl and her team examined almost 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children were equipped with accelerometers ( which are pretty much slightly more technical pedometers ) , and the researchers interviewed their parents to gain a better picture of the child 's mental health . <p> Then , after waiting two years , the researchers contacted the children 's parents and once again gained a picture of their mental health as it evolved with their age . <p> The results showed a clear divide children who were physically active showed fewer symptoms of depression than those who were n't , prompting the researchers to label physical exercise as " protective " of a developing emotional state . <p> Interestingly , it appeared that the best results came from kids who were moderately to vigorously active think wrestling in the backyard or running around like a headless chook that made them breathe heavily and sweat . <p> ( Not sure what intensity you 're exercising at ? Here 's a great explainer on the difference between light activity and vigorous activity . ) <p> " This is important to know , because it may suggest that physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in childhood , " says associate professor Silje Steinsbekk , who mentored Zahl during the study . <p> " We also studied whether children who have symptoms of depression are less physically active over time , but did n't find that to be the case . " <p> As fantastic as the results of the study are , some complications do pop up : because the kids ' mental health statuses were self-reported by their parents , it 's possible that some paternal denial was at play ( " My kid is as happy as can be ! " ) . <p> For the researchers , the final message to parents is clear : it 's not enough to simply limit iPad or computer time you have to actively encourage them to get outside and do something that makes them sweat . 
 <h> How to get the stink out of your protein shaker <p> The gymgoer 's lament : after each workout you load up your trusty shaker with protein powder , but even after repeated washes it 's smelling a little ... off . Or worse : you forgot to wash it out after you used it , and hours ( or days ) later it smells like a dumpster next to a sewage farm . What to do ? <p> First step : rinse it out with hot water . The closer to boiling , the better ( FYI , boiling water can warp cheaper shakers ) . Let the water stand in the shaker for five minutes or so ( and be careful not to burning yourself -- do n't shake it up with dishwashing liquid when it 's full of scalding water , because it 'll likely explode open from the increased pressure ) . 
 <h> Thinking of sitting on an exercise ball at work ? Here 's why you should n't <p> You generally see it early into the new year one by one , the chairs in your office begin to be replaced with enormous inflatable gym balls . <p> " Oh , it 'll activate your core , " proponents of the trend will tell you . " You have to use your abs to sit up straight , so it 's like working out all day without having to go the gym . " <p> The claim , in theory , makes sense : you undeniably use your abs to sit on any chair without a backrest more than when you sit in your , ergonomic , 5000 . <p> But just because you can , does that mean you should ? <p> According to the scientific research , the answer is pretty much a resounding no . <p> In a landmark 2006 study researchers from Waterloo University in Canada found that while sitting on an exercise ball did increase the amount of muscles used , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . <p> This result was repeated later that year , and again in 2009 -- with every experiment revealing that while a ball did theoretically " turn on " your abs , it was just too damn uncomfortable to get any work done . <p> As the researchers discovered time and time again , humans are inherently lazy : no matter whether the participants were sitting on a Swiss ball or an office chair , they all naturally reverted to their classic " slumped over " posture if given enough time . <p> " Prolonged sitting on a stability ball does not greatly alter the manner in which an individual sits , yet it appears to increase the level of discomfort , " wrote the researchers . <p> " Therefore , it is important to fully explore a new chair design and consult scientific research before implementing its use . " <p> It 's a sentiment that many agree with , but replacing your office chair with a blow-up ball is n't just annoying for your spine it 's annoying for your HR department , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire guide as to why people should n't be planting their buttocks on gym equipment when they 're at work using a fitness ball as a chair could constitute as a workplace hazard . <p> " There is little , if any , evidence of scientific trials or studies to demonstrate that the effect fitness balls have in exercise and training makes them suitable for use on a daily basis as a seat at work , " they write on their website . <p> " Providing fitness balls in a workplace may place the employer at risk of introducing a hazard . An employer needs to assess the risk to health and safety where the balls are used , or planned to be used , as seating at work . " <h> The real answer is simply that we need to sit less overall <p> I know , I know , it 's the most annoying fitness preach of all : instead of debating over what we 're sitting on , we really need to think about how we can sit less overall . <p> According to APA Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how ergonomic it is is effectively forcing our body into some kind of " halfway " movement pattern between standing and squatting . <p> " These joints are designed to move , and be upright , so having your back and hip in a flexed position for hours at a time can contribute to imbalances , stiffness and problems with activity . " <p> Thankfully , the solution to cure your dead office butt need n't require you to quit your job just getting up periodically and walking to the office kitchen or toilet is enough to revive even the sleepiest behind . <p> " Prolonged sitting ( more than 30 minutes or so ) appears to be more harmful than the total amount of sitting throughout the day , " advises Rich . <p> " So it 's important to try and break up sitting where possible . This can be done by standing during phone calls , having standing or walking meetings , or visiting someone face to face rather than emailing them . " 
 <h> Excessive sitting not linked to an increased risk of diabetes <p> It 's been dubbed " the new smoking " , but sitting may not be as terrible as we first thought at least when it comes to your chances of developing diabetes . <p> New research from the University of Sydney has discovered that sitting on your butt for hours on end is not the be-all and end-all when it comes to ruining your health . <p> " Sitting has attracted a lot of publicity in recent years for being as dangerous as smoking and for being harmful regardless of how physically active people are , " says lead author Associate Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis . <p> " However this is one of the very few long-term studies to investigate whether there is a link between sitting behaviours and risk of development of diabetes . " <p> Of course , this does n't give you free reign to plonk down wherever you feel like it , because Stamatakis is quick to point out that just because long periods of sitting is n't likely to give you diabetes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long term . <p> " While these findings do n't exonerate sitting , they do suggest that there is far more at play than we previously realised , " argues Stamatakis . <p> When Stamatakis mentions " more at play " , he really means it most studies that have previously looked at the effect sitting has on a person 's diabetes risk only accounted for time sitting in front of the TV , failing to factor in the amount of time you spend sitting at work and during your commute . <p> His research , assisted by colleagues from both home and abroad , was able to pick out the different types of sitting we do and how they were attributed to the risk of diabetes . <p> To do this , the researchers analysed responses from a long-term English study that surveyed 4811 middle-aged Londoners over a 13-year period . <p> In 1998 , each of the participants were asked to report how much time they spent sitting down at work , how much time they sat at home in front of the telly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their commute . <p> Then , 13 years later in 2011 , the participants were quizzed again and the researchers analysed the risk of diabetes caused by sitting making sure to account for factors like diet quality and physical activity . <p> What the results found -- somewhat unsurprisingly -- is that it was n't so much the act of sitting in itself that ruined your health , it was all the behaviours that go along with a night on the couch . <p> " We only found a weak association between TV time and risk for developing diabetes . It is not the sitting per se that TV watching involves that is linked to poorer health , " Stamatakis tells Coach . <p> " Each and every one of these aspects of TV watching independently increases the chances of developing diabetes , but no study can account for all these . " <p> So while sitting was not quite the smoking gun we hoped for , it appeared that the environment in which we sit is decidedly damaging for our health . <p> But where does this leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole day a week watching TV ? Do we simply cut down on the snacks we eat when sitting , or try to reduce sitting overall ? <p> For Stamatakis , the answer is not easy what 's required in his mind is total , sweeping change to our culture that currently expects Australians to spend most of their productive time sitting down . <p> " Sitting is part of the problem , there is no doubt about this , " says Stamatakis . <p> " When someone sits for long periods the muscles are idle and this has all sorts of adverse metabolic consequences . What is even more important is that we modify the environment and empower and encourage ordinary , desk-working Australians to move as much as possible , as often as possible . " <p> Possible solutions include everything from scheduling more " walking meetings " at work to even having governments offer monetary compensation for people willing to walk to work . <p> " Employers and governments can incentivise active commuting and use of public transportation instead of driving to work , " suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could encourage use of stairs instead of lifts and even walking meetings when convenient . " <p> While the future looks decidedly bleak , Stamatakis ' advice for how we can best disease-proof our bodies from the effects of sitting is super simple : we simply have to move more . <p> " There is an awful lot to be done or at least tested by governments and employers , but hardly anything is done on a serious scale , " argues . <p> " ' Move as much as possible as often as possible ' is the best and most evidenced-based message . " 
 <h> Australia is in the grips of a sleep epidemic <p> Just under half the nation is not getting a good night 's sleep , causing rampant problems on the roads , at work and in our relationships . <p> That 's the finding from new research released by the Sleep Health Foundation , which has revealed that 45 percent of Australians either sleep poorly or not at all . <p> It may sound trivial after all , being tired is simply accepted as part of adult life but chronic drastically increases the amount of road fatalities , decreases the nation 's productivity and makes everyone pretty damn cranky . <p> According to Dr David Hillman , a director at the Sleep Health Foundation , the issue comes down to one universal truth : we simply do not prioritise sleep high enough in our lives . <p> " These worrying results just go to show that sleep is not the national health priority it needs to be , " says Hillman in a media release . <p> " Just like obesity , smoking , drinking too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our community . It 's high time we moved this issue off the backburner to the forefront of national thinking . " <p> The statistics in the research paint a picture of a bleary-eyed nation that 's addicted to their phones with late-night Instagram scrolling and Netflix responsible for our tardy bedtimes . <p> " Overall , 44 percent of adults are on the internet just before bed almost every night and 59 percent of these late-night workers , web surfers , movie watchers or online gamers have more than two sleep problems , " adds Hillman . <p> " This is no coincidence . This habit is having a direct and very negative impact on sleep and without a cohesive national strategy to combat it , this wo n't change . " <p> Interestingly , women were more susceptible to this than men 47 percent of females were found to be surfing the net in bed , compared to just 40 percent of men . <p> While the odd yawn at work is unlikely to do any harm to your chances of a promotion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end your ( or someone else 's ) life . <p> The study found that almost a third of adults drive when drowsy every month , and an astonishing one in five Australians have nodded off behind the wheel within the last year . <p> In 2015 a study by Monash University found that an estimated third of all fatal car crashes occur due to fatigue with many more near-fatal accidents not making the formal statistics . <p> For Hillman , the only way to combat our desire the burn the candle at both ends is to institute a full cultural shift where sleep becomes just as important as diet and exercise . <p> " There is a false belief shared by a lot of us that sleep is a waste of time and that we can get away with less than we really need , " argues Hillman . <p> " But the truth is people who cut corners with their sleep function below their best . They are not as mentally sharp , as vigilant , as attentive or as patient as they would otherwise be . " 
 <p> Many of us are religious in our ingestion of protein within 30-60 minutes of a workout , but Shone says it 's not actually necessary to be so vigilant if you 're only working out once a day . <p> " If an athlete is only training once a day , we have 12 to 24 hours for that whole recovery , repair , re-synthesis to occur , " she points out . <p> " If you were doing a PM session and had eaten within the three hours prior to that training bout , it reduces the huge urgency to have protein in that 30-minute window . What you do over the next 12 to 24 hours is more critical . " <p> If you 're training twice a day then recovery nutrition within a small time window is more important . <p> Shone says many gymgoers place unnecessary importance on the ingestion of protein , when what 's more important is actually doing the weights . <p> " A lot of people get a bit bogged down worrying about their protein consumption when really they are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein to make any difference , " Shone points out . 
 <h> What 's the difference between 1000 calories of healthy food and 1000 calories of unhealthy food ? As it turns out , quite a lot <p> The calories-in-calories-out ( CICO ) theory of weight management is simple : if you eat more food than you need , you 'll get fatter . Eat less than you need , and you 'll get skinnier . <p> This is , of course , a gross oversimplification of how our bodies work . Everybody needs a different amount of food , and everybody processes that food a little differently -- but the basic equation still always applies at a big-picture level . <p> Knowing this , many people then wonder : is it possible considering all calories were equal to lose weight eating only junk food ? <h> You 'll build more muscle <p> When it comes to being as healthy , ( and frankly , as good-looking as possible ) having an adequate amount of muscle mass is key . This does n't mean you have to walk around looking like a competitive bodybuilder , but the more muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to become injured , sick or frail . <p> " If you eat a diet that 's high in protein and fibre and nutrients , you 're much likely to build and retain muscle mass , which burns calories even when you 're resting . <p> " Conversely , if you eat a diet high in sugary , processed foods high in unhealthy fats , you 're likely to lose some of that muscle mass and generally not look or feel as good . " <h> Your energy will be more sustained <p> Technically , 1000 calories of processed food contains exactly the same amount of raw energy as 1000 calories of healthy food after all , a calorie is defined as being the amount of energy that 's required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius . <p> But as Cohen explains , if you choose to eat your total days ' worth of energy in Mars Bars , you 're essentially telling your body that you 've decided to dump all of this energy at once , instead of slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you were to eat 1000 calories totally from processed food , you 're likely to go through peaks and troughs with your energy , and feel hungry for much of the day , " explains Cohen . <p> It 's a sentiment that sports dietitian Alison Patterson agrees with , arguing that just because a food is dense with calories , does n't mean it has the nutrients required to keep you going . <p> " Highly processed foods are typically low in fibre which can lead to gut issues such as bloating and stomach pain , " Patterson tells Coach . <p> " It 's also likely that you 'd feel fatigued as many of the essential nutrients needed for good health such as iron and other vitamins and minerals are often lacking in heavily processed foods . " <h> You can eat bigger meals <p> The biggest difference between 1000 calories of junk food and 1000 calories of nutritious food is n't so much avoiding the inevitable sugar coma it 's in the sheer amount of food that you actually get to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sugary drinks and fast food are so calorie-dense , you simply do n't get to eat as much for the same bodily " cost " . <p> " It 's what we call food volume 1000 calories of healthy food will fill up potentially a few plates , where 1000 calories of junk food would look tiny in comparison , " says Cohen . <p> " Plus , because the healthy food is likely to contain wholegrains , healthy fats and protein , so you 're much more likely to be satiated and you wo n't feel hungry again soon after eating . " <h> Your body composition will be better <p> If you 're looking to lose sheer weight , then making sure you 're eating less calories than you need is key . But if you simply want to look better no matter what the number on the scale is -- then you 'll need to focus on building muscle mass , and losing fat . <p> The best way to do that , unsurprisingly , is to improve the quality of your diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of foods you eat can actually play a role in how your body stores fat . <p> " Research has shown that a diet high in processed foods could actually cause your body to store more fat particularly around your stomach . " says Cohen . <p> " Essentially , if you can sacrifice the instant gratification of processed foods you 'll reap all the rewards of long-term health like more muscle mass , improved mood and lower risk of chronic disease from healthy foods .

 <h> Rise of the ' coregasm ' : How ab exercises can trigger pleasure <p> Ladies , for a very select group of you ( 5 percent to be exact ) it may be possible to experience an orgasm during a workout simply by working your core . <p> Dubbed the " coregasm " by media outlets , or EIOs first came to the attention of science way back in 1953 . <p> Under the tutelage of now-discredited scientist Dr Alfred Kinsey , researchers at Indiana University discovered a phenomenon whereby women were experiencing " tingling sensations " when they performed gymnastics-style exercises that heavily stressed their abs and pelvic floor . <p> At the time , the finding was largely written-off as just another of Kinsey 's wacky discoveries -- but with more modern technology we 're beginning to discover the idea is n't so far-fetched . <p> In 2012 , Dr Debby Herbenick also from Indiana University conducted one of the most profound studies into EIO we have to date , profiling more than 350 women using an anonymous survey . <p> As the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexual pleasure during a workout , even though sexual thoughts or fantasies in the gym were almost never present . <p> The most common workout to bring on an EIO was anything that involved your abs ( think hanging leg raises or flutter kicks ) , but many women reported similar feelings during spin classes , lifting weights , running and even swimming . <p> Most of the women in the study who had experienced as coregasm reported that they felt a little embarrassed when it happened , and it made no difference whether they were in a relationship or not . <p> Despite the findings , Herbenick said that while we can theorise it has something to do with muscle contractions around the pelvic floor , we do n't actually know what causes a " coregasm " . <p> " Despite attention in the popular media , little is known scientifically about exercise-induced orgasms , " Herbenick told Live Science . <p> " I think from having talked with colleagues , while some people have heard of these exercise-induced orgasms , many of our colleagues have n't either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the coregasm are the good folk of Reddit , who regularly share stories of their experiences and preferred exercises -- to reach the state of coregasm . <p> " Today I did chest and abs . During my ab workout , while doing hanging leg raises I think I was super close to orgasm ... I left the gym embarrassed and did not do any more , " shared one user on the women 's fitness forum . <p> " Yes ! This happens when I do hamstrings curls either seated or laying prone . I always orgasm during my last set , I seriously try so hard to keep it on the DL down low . I 've never met anyone that orgasms working out , " shared another . <p> Another person who has heard of the infamous " coregasm " is personal trainer Vix Erber , aka " The Bondi Vixen " although she 's never experienced it herself . <p> " I do n't know why it happens but I can confirm it 's a reality for some women , " Erber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainer working in a gym and we had a woman who would experience it on the lying leg curl machine which does n't directly work your core . She was one of the lucky ones I guess ! " <p> Erber points out that whether or not it happens to you seems to be largely by chance , but you should n't let it stop you from working out regardless . <p> " A lot of it is about the way you 're built , how sensitive you are and possibly even how in tune you are with your body , " explains Erber . <p> " If you 're embarrassed about it , listen to your body and stop the exercise just before you feel it happening . If you 're not embarrassed , then I say own it and enjoy the ride ! " 
 <h> How to lift differently , instead of lifting heavier <p> If you 're a regular on your gym 's weights floor , aiming to lift heavier is an important goal but it 's not necessarily the only goal . <p> To gain raw strength , you need to keep hammering your muscles to prompt them to grow ( the technical jargon is " progressive overload " ) . That often translates to lifting heavier and heavier over the long term , but you can also push your muscles by lifting differently . <h> Decrease stability <p> As an exercise becomes less stable , it requires more coordination which means you 'll need to switch on more muscle fibres to keep yourself steady , potentially making the exercise much harder . <p> FYI , " decrease stability " does n't mean you have to start doing your entire workout atop the wobbly side of a bosu or squat on a fitness ball . At its simplest , it could mean switching from machine weights ( which are extremely stable ) to similar movements using free weights ( dumbbells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Change the equipment <p> Spend enough time around the weightlifting crowd and you 'll quickly hear someone say you need to shock your muscles for them to grow . What that basically means is that your body gets used to doing certain movements in a certain way , and will stop adapting or growing if you do n't switch things up . <p> A simple way to do that is to keep the movement the same , but swap dumbbells for barbells or a similar piece of gear . For example : if you 're bored of barbell chest press or rows , switch to dumbbell chest press or rows . Or you could experiment with the equipment in your gym you never used before ( like a TRX , a vipr , or the landmine that thing is brutal ) . <h> Change the reps <p> It 's an age-old question in the gym : " Which is better , sets with a higher number of reps at a lower weight , or a lower number of reps at a higher weight ? " The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of the science . ) <p> But if you 're bored of your current program or you 're stuck in a plateau , one way to get out of it is to switch up the number of reps you 're doing . ( I was once prescribed a program that had 25 reps of barbell squats at a weight that seemed laughably easy for about the first 10 reps , then ratcheted up to cruel and unusual torture for the last five . ) <p> Sidenote : there 's a common belief that high reps/low weight is better for " toning " and low reps/high weight is better for strength , but that 's not really true . <h> Change the timing <p> " Time under tension " ( TUT ) and " time under load " are two concepts that regular gymgoers have a lot of opinions about , and if you Google either of them you 'll quickly get bogged down in a swamp of ( sometimes conflicting ) information . <p> What it all essentially boils down to is that you can overload your muscles by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you currently do bicep curls with by lifting in one second then lowering for three seconds , try lifting for two seconds then lowering for four seconds . For more advanced options , add a pause at the top or bottom of a movement . <h> Change your grip <p> If you only ever do barbell rows or barbell chest press using an overhand grip ( or a pronated grip , to use the lingo ) , you 'll be surprised by how much harder it can be if you use a Swiss bar to switch to a neutral grip ( that is , where your palms are facing one another ) . The trick works with a whole range of equipment , including dumbbells doing bicep curls with a supinated ( palms down , or underhand ) grip burns a whole different part of your arm . <p> For movements like pull-ups or pulldowns that work your back , switching from an overhand to underhand grip ( or vice versa ) will make dramatic differences to the difficulty level as well as improving your posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing a nice Mr Burns hunch . <h> Try supersets <p> A superset is a set born on the planet Krypton and gifted incredible powers by Earth 's yellow sun two ( sometimes more ) exercises done back-to-back with minimal rest in between . The two exercises might be completely different movements ( squats for your legs superset with pulldowns for your back , for example ) or the same movement with different variations ( a set of heavy barbell rows superset with lighter dumbbells rows ) . <p> Supersets are great because they 're a fast , simple way to overload your muscles . ( Drop sets are a similar concept . ) Important note : avoid doing them during peak hour at the gym , when hogging multiple pieces of equipment is a faux pas akin to bicep curls in the squat rack . <h> Perfect your form <p> Before you go heavier , it 's vital to make sure you 're doing an exercise the right way if your technique is off , it means you 're not targeting the muscle groups you think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just ask anyone who 's put out their spine because their deadlift comes all from the back and none from the legs . ) <p> Often , learning the correct form makes an exercise way harder , because other muscles are prevented from jumping in to help . See a personal trainer to analyse your technique , or recruit a mate who knows what he 's talking about . <h> Go bodyweight <p> Yep , the path to muscle gains can ironically come from ditching the weights altogether . Just look at the fitness actual Greek gods on Instagram who ( claim to ) do nothing but calisthenics the " beautiful strength " that gets you ripped using little more than the weight of your own body . Reddit 's community is a good place to start before long you too will be boasting about your L-sit pull-up and your front lever . <h> Intensity , intensity , intensity <p> One last note : If you 're chasing results , what ultimately matters is n't so much how you 're lifting or how heavy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine to have a half-arsed workout every now and then , but if all your workouts are on the lazy side you 'll never progress . Push yourself as hard as you can , as often as you can ( while taking time to recover and not injuring yourself ) , and you 'll be posting smug #TransformationTuesday before-and-afters selfies before you know it . 
 <p> More fancied brain programs like My Brain Trainer ( $29.95 for a year 's subscription ) and Luminosity ( $299.95 for a lifetime subscription ) were rated farther down the list as Level 2 and 3 programs respectively . <p> For lead researcher Professor Ralph Martins , these findings prove that slowing down the rate of degenerative cognitive diseases does n't have to cost you the earth . <p> " We found that the current evidence indicates that at least some of the commercially available brain training programs can assist in promoting healthy brain aging , " said Martins in a statement . <p> " The evidence now supports the notion that the human brain is plastic in later life and can benefit from properly designed brain training programs . " <p> The reason why these programs help your brain stay in tip top shape harks back to an age-old bit of common sense : if you do n't use it , you 'll lose it . <p> By regularly testing your neural capabilities , you 're effectively forcing your brain to grow more efficient to deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a muscle that grows back stronger after using it in the gym . <p> By doing this regularly , the researchers theorise that people are able to " keep open " the brain 's pathways that traditionally shut down as a result of dementia . <p> Other strategies to delay the onset of dementia include regularly engaging in aerobic activity , eating a healthy diet and keeping your social life active as you age . 
 <h> No matter how much you weigh , exercise can lower your risk of cancer <p> We know that obesity is a major risk factor for several cancers , and we know that exercising helps you lower it -- but ground-breaking new research from Cancer Council NSW has shown that those two factors could actually be independent of each other . <p> What that means is that no matter how heavy or light you are -- you could be 30kg overweight or skinny but " untrained " -- exercise can majorly reduce your risk of cancer . <p> After analysing the bodyweight and physical activity of almost 9000 people , the researchers concluded that when it came to your cancer risk , any exercise at all is better than none . <p> For lead researcher Dr , this finding may come at a shock to those who consider themselves to be safe by having a healthy weight alone . <p> " We certainly hear quite often that people who are at a healthy weight feel that they have less of a need to exercise , but our findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to exercise , for whatever reason , " Dr tells Coach . <p> " Our study suggests that any level of physical activity can reduce your cancer risk , irrespective of what your weight is . A lack of exercise for any group of people , no matter their weight , is not a good thing . " <p> Just how much exercise you need remains to be seen -- but Dr says most people should aim to be active every day , even if it 's as simple as going for a walk . <p> " This is why we recommend that everyone , regardless of their weight , aims for at least 60 minutes of moderate or 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity every day , " she says . <p> The reason why this works as the researchers found is because exercise has several profound effects on your body 's immune system to help it delay or stunt cancer cells from growing . <p> Hitting the gym , going for a run and even taking the stairs at work has been proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease the amount of inflammation in your body all factors which promote the growth of cancers . <p> " Previous research has shown that 1800 cases of bowel , breast ( post-menopause ) and endometrial cancer cases could be prevented each year if Australians were physically active for more than 150 minutes per week , " says Dr . <p> Of course , the researchers are quick to point out that while exercise and your body weight may be independent factors of each other when it comes to cancer , that does n't mean all of us should give up on the dream of losing the spare tyre around the middle . <p> " We also encourage everyone to achieve a healthy weight , and follow a balanced and healthy diet . Being overweight or obese is the cause for nearly 4000 cancer cases in Australia each year , " explains Dr . <p> " We know that one in three cancer cases can be prevented -- obesity and physical activity are key players in this .

New research indicates we need to eat even more than that . <p> After analysing scores of studies , a team from Imperial College London has recommended upping the daily dose to fruit and veg to 800g to give the best odds of warding off heart attack , stroke , cancer and early death . <p> Apples and pears , citrus fruits , salads and green leafy vegetables such as spinach , lettuce and chicory , and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli , cabbage and cauliflower were linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease risk . <p> Green vegetables , such as spinach or green beans , yellow vegetables , such as peppers and carrots , and cruciferous vegetables were linked to a reduction in cancer risk . <p> " Most likely it is the whole package of beneficial nutrients you obtain by eating fruits and vegetables that is crucial is health , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the School of Public Health at Imperial , in a statement . <p> " This is why it is important to eat whole plant foods to get the benefit , instead of taking antioxidant or vitamin supplements ( which have not been shown to reduce disease risk ) . " <p> That 800g is twice the current British nutrition guidelines recommending five " portions " of fruit and vegetable a day , where a portion is equal to 80g totalling 400g of fruit and veg a day . <p> Doubling that to 10 portions , or 800g , could prevent an estimated 7.8 million early deaths around the world every year , according to the Imperial team 's calculations . <p> " We wanted to investigate how much fruit and vegetables you need to eat to gain the maximum protection against disease , and premature death . Our results suggest that although five portions of fruit and vegetables is good , 10 a day is even better , " Dr Aune explained . <p> In Australia , the government 's dietary guidelines recommend about five serves of veggies per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and two serves of fruit a day ( a serve is about 150g ) so our daily guidelines are already pretty close to the 10 " portions " recommended by the new guidelines . 
 <h> Is chewing sugar-free gum bad for you ? According to the experts , probably not <p> Aside from coffee and Diet Coke , there 's one food in the office that 's consumed more ravenously than the surprisingly daily plate of birthday cake and that 's sugar-free gum . <p> Consisting of a strange mix of artificial sweeteners , gel thickeners and mint-flavoured preservatives , you 'd think that sugar-free gum would be the worst possible thing you could put in your mouth but is that true ? <p> According the experts , it is n't -- but that does n't mean we should all be throwing back stick after stick of gum . <p> " Sugar-free gum is low in kilojoules and is beneficial for healthy teeth , so I believe that chewing sugar free gum can be a beneficial habit , " accredited practising dietitian Melanie McGrice tells Coach . <p> " The only impact that I 've seen chewing sugar free gum have on people 's diets , is to reduce their desire for snacking between meals . " <p> It 's a sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when consumed in moderation there 's so little energy in sugar-free gum ( In one 2.8 gram serving size of Extra sugar-free gum , there 's only or 6 calories ) that it 's hard to say it has any effect at all . <p> However , Patterson does make an important point that while sugar-free gum is n't bad for you -- it is n't necessarily good for you when you count the nutrients . <p> " While sugar-free gum contains no significant kilojoules , it also lacks the good stuff with no vitamins , minerals or fibre . " <h> How it regulates your appetite <p> If you 're a regular snacker who ca n't go five minutes without tucking into a container of desk-side almonds or carrot sticks , then sugar-free gum may be an option to help curb your appetite between meals . <p> As McGrice explains , the reason why gum blunts your normal hunger signals is because it more or less " tricks " your brain into thinking you 're constantly eating even if nothing is going into your stomach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective strategy to reduce snacking between meals for some people , " explains McGrice . <p> " There was an interesting study undertaken in 2011 which found that people who chewed sugar free gum consumed smaller portions of snacks between meals than those who did n't consume the gum . " <p> But just because you can curb your appetite with chewing gum , does that mean you should ? No , says Patterson because your body releases hunger signals for very legitimate reasons . <p> " Chewing gum as a way to avoid eating when hungry is n't a great idea . Hunger is the body 's natural cue that we need something to eat , just like we get a signal from our bladder that we need to go to the toilet , " argues Patterson . <p> " Rather than chewing gum when we 're hungry , it 's best to tune in to what your body is actually feeling like at the time whether that is something sweet or savoury , hot or cold , soft or crunchy . <p> " By paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time we feel hungry , we 're much better able to regulate our appetite rather than trying to ' outsmart ' our body by ignoring our hunger cues . " <h> Eat too much and your gut will let you know <p> Of course , like almost any food on the planet ( including water ) , if you consume way too much sugar-free gum there will be unintended consequences . <p> As you may have noticed , each pack of sugar-free gum carries a label indicating that " excess consumption may have a laxative effect " although both experts warn that you 'd probably have to eat a lot of gum for that to happen . <p> " Artificial sweeteners such as sorbitol and mannitol are often used in sugar-free gums . These artificial sweeteners are types of polyols ( sugar alcohols ) which commonly cause intolerances in large doses , " says McGrice . <p> " Unless you have a fructose or polyol intolerance , you 'd have to eat multiple packs of sugar-free gum each day for it to impact upon your bowels. " 
 <h> Why you should n't use cotton buds to clean your ears <p> For some people , digging around in your ear canal with a cotton bud to scoop out satisfyingly large clumps of wax is as habitual as cleaning your teeth or washing your hair . <p> Not only does it feel productive , it also feels good because the inner tunnel of your ear is loaded with nerve endings , cleaning your ears can often simulate the pleasure of an orgasm . <p> But despite the innate pleasure and feeling of cleanliness , we 've got bad news : cleaning your ears with cotton buds is not a good idea , and you should stop right this instant . <p> " A good rule of thumb for most people is that they should n't put anything smaller than their elbow in their ear , " Richard Harvey , professor of rhinology at the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University , tells Coach . <p> The American Academy of Otolaryngology ( no , that 's not a prehistoric dinosaur that 's the study of ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , and shoving cotton-covered toothpicks into your ears was given a big no-no . <p> " Patients often think that they are preventing earwax from building up by cleaning out their ears with cotton swabs , paper clips , ear candles , or any number of unimaginable things that people put in their ears , " group chair of the Academy Dr Seth Schwartz told Science Alert . <p> " The problem is that this effort to eliminate earwax is only creating further issues because the earwax is just getting pushed down and impacted further into the ear canal . " <p> As Schwartz explains , what happens when you push a Q-tip deep into your ear canal is that it essentially acts like a giant battering ram , pushing the earwax you so eagerly sought to remove deeper and deeper into your ear . <p> In fact , if you kept this up regularly , you could eventually push so much wax into your ear that you cause partial deafness in what the experts term a cerumen impaction . <p> According to Audiology Australia ( the governing body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of sliding cotton buds into your ears extend well beyond simply pushing earwax around they could also seriously damage your hearing permanently . <p> " You should never use cotton buds to clean your ears . Cotton buds will generally push the wax further into your ear and compact it , making it more difficult to remove , " they write on their website . <p> " Although the cotton is soft the stick is very stiff and it is easy to scratch the inside of your ear with a cotton bud which may lead to infections . <p> " Of course there is also the risk that if you are bumped or if something happens to cause you to lose control you can perforate your ear drum with a cotton bud . " <p> Okay -- so despite just how damn good it feels to clean out your ears with a cotton bud , it appears that every dig , swizzle and slide you make might be doing you damage . So how then are you meant to clean your ears ? <p> According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Most people do n't suffer from wax build up and if you are one of these people then you actually do n't need to clean your ears out at all , " recommends Audiology Australia . <p> " The skin in the ear canals grows like our fingernails from the inside out . As it grows it drags the wax out with it . <p> " So for most people it is enough to just wipe the wax away with a tissue or flannel when it reaches the outer portion of the ear canal . " <p> If you have particularly grandpa-like ears that run like a 24/7 wax factory , then your best bet is to go to a professional like your local GP or ears , nose and throat ( ENT ) specialist . <p> For Professor Harvey , there are - like all medical scenarios - some situations in which you might need to have your ears cleaned out by a medical professional . <p> " Like all things , there is a caveat as to when someone might need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " move " like they should causing wax to build up inside the ear some people have dermatitis issues that require cleaning , and people who spend a lot of time with protective equipment in their ears like plugs or wax swimming plugs may not have normal function , " explains Professor Harvey . <p> When you 're there , the experts have a variety of ways of prizing out your preciously collected wax , but generally they 'll try to " float " the wax out of your ears using squirts of warm water , or they 'll push a tiny little hose into your ear canal that sucks it out . <p> Whatever you do , try not to get sucked into the " woo-woo " practice of popping a burning candle into your ear because there 's unsurprisingly little evidence that it works . <p> " You should not use ear candles under any circumstances . At best they will do nothing and at worst they can be harmful , " recommends Audiology Australia . <p> " Scientific analysis of ear candles has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle-wax in the ear . " 
 <h> Some teenage boys drink over 50 litres of soft drink a year , research finds <p> Teenage boys are the biggest guzzlers of soft drink in the nation , with one in six putting back an alarming 52 litres or more of sugary beverages every year . <p> That 's the finding from new research released by the Cancer Council , who found that teenage boys are far more likely to make trips to the vending machine than their female counterparts . <p> This might not sound like ground-breaking news , but experts warn that the sheer quantity of soft-drink consumed by teenage boys is setting them up for dire health consequences . <p> " A litre of soft drink a week may not sound like much , but over a year it equates to at least 5.2kg of extra sugar , " says Cancer Council spokesperson Kathy Chapman . <p> " This does n't even account for other sugar-sweetened beverages such as energy drinks , cordials and fruit-flavoured drinks , or the sugar they consume in junk food and snacks . " <p> After quizzing almost 9000 Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that it was the girls putting the boys to shame when it came to putting their health first . <p> " Overall , almost 17 percent of teenage boys about 150,000 consume a litre of sugary soft drink a week , compared to just under 10 percent of females , " explains Chapman . <p> " Australian males already have poorer health in adulthood including a shorter life expectancy , higher risk of dying early from chronic diseases , including cancer . Without action our next generation of men will continue to fall behind . " <p> Reasons for the proliferation of soft drink in the average teenagers diet were the availability and price of the sugary beverages , with many young boys being able to afford a drink before and after school . <p> " Soft drinks appeal to teenagers who see them as cheap and affordable beverage options , " says Chapman . <p> " The research suggests that those who drank a lot of soft drink were more likely to be accessing it through high school canteens or vending machines . " <p> While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft drinks around the nation has actually fallen steadily in recent years , as more people realise the effect added sugar has on weight gain . <p> Chapman is quick to point out that while it 's easy to blame the schools for these figures , most of the attitudes around soft drink consumption actually start at home . <p> " While we are aware that soft drink consumption amongst teens has dropped in recent years , this new research discovered that high soft drink consumption is four times higher among students who had soft drinks usually available at home , " explains Chapman . <p> " Parents and high schools clearly have a role to play in discouraging soft drink consumption . " 
 <p> Not only did supplementing with eggshell powder improve the bone density of the researcher 's subjects , it also showed promising signs for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis . <p> " Eggshell powder is a natural source of calcium and other elements which may have a positive effect on bone metabolism , " wrote Dr Josef Rovensky , who lead the study . <p> " Clinical and experimental studies showed that eggshell powder has positive effects on bone and cartilage and that it is suitable in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis . " <p> Then -- like pretty much all quirky health findings these days the news hit the internet some years later where it was picked up by a cacophony of wellness and " natural living " bloggers . <p> blog has been written , each of them espousing the admittedly scientifically proven benefits of eating the shell of an egg but there was a tidbit of information often lost in the headlines . <p> While these sites make it sound like you should chomp into egg shells straight out of the pantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggshell powder that had been so finely reduced that you probably could n't detect it at all in your food . <p> Even the New York column space to the practice of eating an egg shell , concluding that it 's probably not worthwhile to deliberately eat the egg shells at home , but that commercially available eggshell powder " could be a useful source of dietary calcium " . <p> So the question remains : do you continue throw out the shells and wait for big business to start using a powdered variety to fortify their products or do you break them up and sprinkle them on your food yourself ? <p> The answer , according to Argentinian researchers who asked this very same question in 2013 , is surprising : you certainly can prepare egg shell as a calcium supplement at home and reap the benefits . <p> " A single eggshell contains roughly two grams of calcium ; therefore , half an eggshell could provide the amount of Ca needed by adult human beings per day , " wrote lead researcher Lucas R. Brun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ca dietary supplement is powdered to add to bread , pizza or spaghetti as there were small changes in texture and no changes in flavour . " <p> The takeaway from all of this research is quite simple if a piece of shell happens to land in your scrambled eggs ( and you are n't disgusted by the texture ) then there 's no need to spend 15 minutes fishing it out with an oversized spatula . <p> Does that mean you should be deliberately sprinkling egg shell into your food ? Not necessarily -- because it 's totally possible to get your daily dose of calcium from a regular diet alone , even if you do n't drink milk . 
 <p> Ian Wallace , a prominent UK dream psychologist , told Coach dreams are actually a combination of all three -- and it 's certainly not about mysticism or being psychic . <p> " A dream is how you imagine yourself , " he explains . <p> " It 's how you imagine the person you have been and how you imagine the person you would like to become . " <p> Wallace cites research that shows at least 98 percent of what we experience each day happens unconsciously -- it 's our brains absorbing the blue train seat and the lady scratching her face and the sound of the beeping door , without our conscious brain paying it any heed . <p> " On average , a human being consciously processes about 40 thoughts per minute but unconsciously we are processing between 10 and 11 million pieces of information per minute , " he explains . <p> " Some of it is inconsequential , like the room temperature or hearing traffic outside , but a lot of it is around emotional tension when you are trying to fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Our subconscious hangs onto this information throughout the day . Then , when you fall asleep , the dream phase of sleep tries to make sense of it . <p> " The usual conception of dreaming is that dreams happen to you , but the reality is , you happen to the dream , " Wallace says . <p> In fact , Wallace describes dreaming as the " ultimate selfie " . <p> " It 's very self-focused and you 're trying to understand yourself , " he says . <h> Dreaming inside the brain <p> Wallace 's perspective on dreams stems from research done by psychoanalyst and neuropsychologist Mark Solms , who Wallace says used an fMRI scanner in the 1990s to look at people 's brain activity while they were dreaming . <p> " The three main parts that are active when you are dreaming are the limbic system , which is how you process emotion ; the prefrontal cortex , which is about imagination and how you create stories ; and the medial forebrain , which is about how you fulfil need , " Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brain that are active when you are dreaming are to do with creating stories about how you can fulfil need by resolving emotional tension and developing your emotional intelligence or capability . " <p> There is debate within psychological circles about the nature of dreaming , with researchers like Harvard psychiatrist Dr Allan Hobson arguing that dreaming is actually like a computer function that helps the brain " warm its circuits " in anticipation of the sights , sounds and emotions we experience when we wake . <p> " It helps explain a lot of things , like why people forget so many dreams , " Dr. Hobson told The New York Times . <p> " It 's like jogging ; the body does n't remember every step , but it knows it has exercised . It has been tuned up . It 's the same idea here : dreams are tuning the mind for conscious awareness . " <p> But Wallace disagrees , arguing that our brains are much more complex than any machine and that dreams hold the key to understanding our true nature , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understanding dream metaphors <p> We might assume that metaphors are clever literary tools used to liven up a good book , but Wallace says they are actually one of the key principles for how our brains work . <p> Wallace has analysed more than 200,000 dreams and wrote the book The Top 100 Dreamsand says that there are universal metaphors people automatically use all over the world . <p> It 's the way we associate warmth with comfort and cold with loneliness ( which Wallace says stems from feeling warm and comfortable when our parents held us as children ) and the way we liken being in the driver 's seat of a car symbolically with being in control . <p> " The second most common dream is teeth falling out , but it 's nothing to do with dentists , " Wallace explains . <p> " It 's about power and confidence because you tend to show your teeth in waking life on two main occasions either when you are happy and smiling or angry and snarling a bit . " <p> In fact , Wallace says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wallace says our brains use our bodies and the surrounding landscape to make powerful symbols in our dreams . <p> " It might seem like a bizarre story you are creating but if you work through the imagery , you will usually find a powerful message for yourself , " Wallace says . <h> Storage for the future <p> Dreams do n't just offer insights into our emotional state they also serve to embed memories for potential future use . <p> " The rapid eye movement phase is a time when we are working out where to file memories and getting rid of memories we no longer need . The rational part of the brain is deactivated so we have our most creative thoughts , " sleep scientist Dr Carmel Harrington told Coach . <p> " Research also indicates that rapid eye movement sleep is important for getting rid of memory too . You have loads and loads of things that you encounter every day that go into your brain and your brain has to make decisions about what neural connections to keep and which ones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams <p> Wallace says one of the most powerful gifts we can give ourselves is learning to remember our dreams , then analyse them for insights into ourselves . <p> He suggests using a technique called Will , Still , Fill . <p> " Tonight when you go to bed and lay your head on your pillow , tell yourself , ' Tonight I WILL remember a dream or part of a dream ' , " he says . <p> " When you wake up , lie completely STILL do n't chat to your partner , look at the clock or even wiggle your toes because as soon as you move , the dream imagery will start to fade . The dream imagery might just be in static images but as it comes back you FILL in the gaps between images . " <p> Once you have a clear insight of what happened during the night , you can start to make sense of why you created those images . <p> " You create everything you experience in the dream and you do that as a way of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you truly believe , " Wallace says . <p> " You are continuously using your dreams to build up life experience and understand your expectations you 're doing a very powerful neurological thing .

 <h> Four stretches to help ease the pain of period cramps <p> Over the course of a woman 's fertile lifetime , she 'll go through a total of 456 periods and that potentially means a staggering 6.25 years or 2280 days of associated aches and pains . <p> As common as it is , spending that much time in pain is enough to cramp anyone 's style . <p> Along with common remedies like hot water bottles , discounted chocolate and Netflix marathons , a good way to put the kibosh on pain is a stretch session : not only does it boost circulation , it also helps to relieve the tension caused by cramps . <p> But what stretches are the most effective ? According to Grana , these four yoga poses should be the go-to for every woman who suffers from cramps and best of all , they only take a few minutes to complete . <h> Stretch 1 : Camel pose , aka " the cramp interrupter " <p> Stop those cramps right in their tracks with a move borrowed from your local hatha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform it , rest with your knees on a yoga mat ( or your lounge room rug , or even your bed ) , place both hands on your bum , and gently lean back as if you wanted your ponytail to touch your heels . <p> Take care to stretch slowly and deliberately , extending all the way from your core up and through your neck . This stretch opens up your hip flexors and relieves the tension of being doubled over in pain . <h> Stretch 2 : Reclined bound angle , aka " the womb whisperer " <p> Despite my personal opinion that nothing in this world should be referred to as a " womb whisperer " , this stretch is incredible for easing tension through your hips and regulating your breathing . <p> To perform it , lay with your back flat on the floor , looking at the ceiling . Bring your arms out to either side at a 45-degree angle , and push the soles of your feet together , letting your knees splay out to either side . <p> For those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees not touching the floor at first -- just focus on your breathing and you 'll find that they 'll drop to their natural position in no time . <h> Stretch 3 : The cobra , aka " the ovary easer " <p> If you spend a lot of time sitting down -- period cramps or not -- then the cobra is tailor-made for you . <p> To perform it , lie face down on the ground and bring your hands up to your chest as if you were going to do a push-up . Then , hinging at your lower back , gently bring your upper body up so you 're looking directly forward . <p> The more advanced you become , the deeper the " bend " you 'll be able to create in your lower back but do n't push your limits the first time you try it -- it should never feel painful . <h> Stretch 4 : Child 's pose , aka " the shhh ... be still pose " <p> Children are the most hopped-up , rambunctious little creatures on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them all . <p> Then , moving slowly and deliberately , reach out with both arms as far in front of you as you can , dipping your head between your arms . <p> This pose relieves much of the tension in your upper back , which is where most of our daily stress ends up collecting . This is because feelings of anxiety cause us to physiologically create a kind of " tortoise shell " with our bodies , bringing our shoulders forward and causing the muscles in your upper back to tense up . 
 <h> F45 Playoffs : the most brutal 10-minute workout of your life <p> When I arrive at Manly Beach on a Friday afternoon for 2017 's F45 Playoffs , it 's raining that 's bad news for an outdoor event , but I 'm wo n't pretend I 'm not secretly relieved . <p> The Playoffs are an intense test of fitness skills , and they 're a little intimidating . I also participated in 2016 , and the memories of breathlessness and nausea are still fresh . If the weather today does n't clear , and I get to go home to my couch instead ... well , I 'm not going to lie . That would be a little bit great . <p> Despite the light drizzle , a crowd has gathered in front of the impressive three-level rig decked out in F45 's signature red-white-and-blue where the test is staged . Some of them are curious spectators , others hopeful participants . Their vibe is a mix of nervous excitement and disappointment that bad weather might force it all off . <p> But -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the 4pm kick-off , and we line up to begin . <p> The F45 Playoffs consist of 10 exercises ( or " stations " , in circuit training parlance ) , each lasting 45 seconds with a 15-second break in between , totalling a mere 10-minute workout . That 's a fraction of a regular F45 class so , in theory , this should be easy . <p> In reality , it 's brutal . While all the stations are familiar to regular , they come one after the other in punishing succession , and demand maximum effort . With F45 's scrutineers watching and urging you to go hard , there 's no . <p> The challenge starts on the top level : first the rowing machine ; bench hops ; push-ups combined with a knee tuck ; then sideways hops . <p> Participants then slide down an actual fireman 's pole to the second level for more torture : box jumps combined with dreaded burpees ; unassisted chin-ups ; a squat and overhead press ; Russian twists ( a killer core move ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a ramp to the final station : short sprints combined with another sideways hop . Each station is graded out of 100 for a possible score out of 1000 ( the top scorers rank up around the 800s ) , though the final mark is almost irrelevant you 're just thankful to have finished it . <p> On the day I participate ( this year 's Manly Playoffs ran from February 25 to March 5 ) , I 'm second in line . The first victim is Jennifer Springfield , a regular F45 attendee who 's visiting from Perth and impulsively decided to do the Playoffs with a friend . <p> " Oh my god ! " she cries as she straps herself into the rowing machine to start the challenge . <p> I start right after her . An agonising 10 minutes later we 're both gasping for breath , but with big smiles on our faces partly relief that it 's over , mostly pride that we made it through . <p> Springfield confesses she had a lot of " nerves and anxiety " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do it , but at the same time , I thought ' Just go and do it ! ' " she says . <p> She tells me her favourite stations were the tucks and the squat and press , but she had a hard time with the pull-ups ( which many people struggle to perform without assistance ) and the Russian twists . <p> " I 've had three kids , so I struggle with ab stuff , " she says . " But I feel really good . I 'm not perfect at all the stations , but I think that 's life . I can beat myself up and say I did n't do every station perfectly , but not everyone can be perfect . " <p> Would she encourage anyone who does F45 to give the Playoffs a crack ? <p> " Absolutely ! " <p> Dan Conn , a former NRL player and the face of F45 Training , tells me that the atmosphere at this year 's Playoffs ( at least on the days when the weather has held out ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle , " he says . " Especially when all 10 stations are full and there 's all these people chasing down each other . " 
 <h> How many days a week do you have to hit the gym to build muscle ? <p> Ask any self-confessed gym junkie how many exercise sessions they do a week and your eyes will likely pop out of your skull with replies ranging from four to eight-plus , it 's easy to get the impression that these people have the willpower of an ancient Greek god . <p> The truth , in reality , is that they do n't -- they simply love the gym ( or the results that it brings ) so much that a day without training is a day wasted . <p> But if you do n't love the gym ? What if the thought of spending hours a week heaving and clanging weights bores you to tears ? What then , is the absoluteminimum you need to go to the gym to build muscle ? <p> According to Kristin Lewis , personal trainer and founder of Life Personal Trainers in Adelaide , that questions hinges on a whole lot of factors so much so that it 's pretty much impossible to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to make gains . <p> " We 've seen muscle gain on clients doing a single weight-training session per week -- something is always better than nothing ! " Lewis tells Coach . <p> " Greater gains would be made with greater frequency , with three to four sessions week being ideal . " <h> Genetics and training style play a huge role <p> Of course , it 's a no-brainer that " going to the gym four times a week " does n't necessarily mean anything . With all respect to aerobics classes , you 're not going to pack on any appreciable size doing Zumba four times a week compared to old-school weight lifting . <p> As Lewis explains , in order to gain muscle you 're going to have be lifting heavily , stressing your muscles , and making sure that you 're not doing too much of the dreaded " c word " ... cardio . <p> " The intensity of each gym session is also a big factor -- higher-intensity sessions where the person training works to ' failure with good technique ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sets so that the session does n't become too aerobic , " says Lewis . <p> " This needs to be balanced with the potential injury risks of lifting maximally . I 'd obviously suggest this be done under the guidance of a personal trainer to reduce this intensity . " <p> Also at play are your genetics just like one person can walk into the gym with enormous ( natural ) calves and a propensity for putting on pec size , others may find it a struggle to lift themselves out of a naturally beanpole physique . <p> " We know that some people are naturally more muscular and their bodies will respond more rapidly to weight training whereas other people -- skinny cyclists like me tend to be more linear in their body type so do n't increase muscle mass as rapidly , " says Lewis . <h> You 're either taking advantage of or fighting against your age <p> Walk into any nursing home and you 'll quickly realise that your chances of staying jacked well into your eighties are slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Arnold Schwarzenegger has found that age makes maintaining muscle a task easier said than done . <p> If you 're young , in your twenties or thirties , then you likely have all the tools you need to put on the most muscle in your life your sex hormones responsible for growth ( primarily testosterone ) are at their peak , and you 're at an age where pumping up your arms for an hour everyday does n't seem like a huge waste of time . <p> If you 're much older , then Lewis says you 've got to re-frame your goal , because simply avoiding going backwards is seen as a win . <p> " Muscle protein is constantly being replaced in our bodies . As we get older , the amount of protein breakdown tends to exceed the amount of protein gain resulting in net muscle loss as we age , " says Lewis . <p> " Consequently , for the older population , just maintaining their weight ( muscle mass ) might actually be a net improvement . " <h> It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating enough <p> Of course , there 's an extremely frail elephant in the room when it comes to gaining muscle mass and no , it is n't steroids it 's food . You could literally spend every waking hour in the gym , but if you 're not eating enough food you 'll fail to anything other than a little definition . <p> " As a general principle , people looking to build muscle mass would need a greater overall protein intake , regularly throughout the day , " recommends Lewis . <p> But just how many calories , and how much protein ? Is it a case of chugging back protein shakes so often that your bum resembles a combustion engine ? 
 <h> Foods to eat and avoid for a healthy heart <p> Nutrition science is tricky stuff , but despite the seemingly conflicting advice thrown our way there are dietary patterns clearly associated with a reduction in heart disease risk . A new report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology aims to clear up the confusion by highlighting some foods to eat , limit and avoid for a healthy heart . <p> Olive oil is the backbone of the Mediterranean diet , a way of eating linked to an impressive array of health benefits . Studies show that extra virgin olive oil consumed in moderate quantities can reduce our risk of heart problems , such as bad cholesterol , inflammation and oxidative damage , and is also linked with a lower cancer risk and believed to be beneficial for blood pressure , obesity , immune function and rheumatoid arthritis. 
 <p> Turn every meal into a grim chore with these scientifically monotonous diet hacks . <h> Photograph everything you eat -- everything <p> If you ( correctly ) think that scrolling through endless photos of unremarkable meals on Instagram is the worst , you 're not going to like a new finding from Oregon State University : photographing everything you eat could be a path to weight loss and management . <p> The thinking goes that you can then take those photos to a properly trained dietitian , who can help you accurately analyse your eating patterns ( without having to rely on your memory , which is notoriously bad at recalling what you 've eaten ) . <p> " Images can facilitate your recall of what you ate , " said the study 's author , dietitian Mary Cluskey , in a statement . " They also prompt important questions from a dietitian : ' Was that low-fat dressing or high-fat ? ' Plus , images make dietary assessments more entertaining because people do like to take pictures of food . " <p> True , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snap yet another bowl of everyday porridge ... <h> Count every bite <p> A 2015 pilot study seemed to confirm an age-old weight-loss trick : count every bite of your food and you 'll lose weight . Brigham Young University ( BYU ) had volunteers count how many bites they made in a day that is , the number of times they lifted food to their mouth then commit to cutting their bites by 20 to 30 percent . <p> Participants who reduced their bites dropped about two kilos in four weeks , without changing anything else about their eating or exercise routines . Basically , they lost weight because they ate less , without even realising they were eating less . <p> Which is great , except counting every single bite gets really boring really fast . ( Apparently we should all aim for about 100 bites a day . ) Even the researchers acknowledged it 's a pain so BYU teamed up with a tech startup to develop an app that counts bites for you , presumably so we can pay attention to mealtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 seconds between bites <p> If you thought eating was meant to be fun , think again . A study from the University of California found that by waiting 30 seconds in between bites of food , children were less likely to overeat because their hunger signals had time to kick in . <p> The researchers found that the best way to do this was with a small 30 second hourglass timer , this way people were more likely to approach meals like they were a game . <p> Lead author of the study Geert Schmid Schonbein , says that the main benefit of " slow eating " is that people wo n't have to change their daily diet in the short term . <h> Chew every bite 40 times <p> If counting every bite sounds tedious , imagine how tedious it 's going to be to count every bite and then chew every bite 40 times . <h> Eat in silence , and listen to yourself chew <p> Imagine listening to somebody else eating the sloppiest foods imaginable - cereal , soup , spaghetti and mangos . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss trick discovered by researchers at Brigham Young University , who have found that listening to yourself chew actually reduces the overall amount of food that you consume . Coined the " crunch effect " , it only worked when people ate with the television off , no headphones and no background music . <p> The researchers say it is n't because the sound of teeth gnashing and tongues wagging that grosses people out , it 's because you are being mindful of what you 're eating . <h> Cut all your food into teeny-tiny pieces <p> A 2012 study from Arizona State University fed 301 college students either a whole bagel or a same-size bagel sliced into quarters . Twenty minutes later , the students were offered an all-you-can-eat free lunch ; those who ate the sliced bagel chowed down on 25 percent less lunch than the eaters . <p> Psychologist Devina Wadhera , who led the study , speculated that food cut into multiple bite-sized pieces tricks your brain into thinking you 've eaten more than you have . ( Foolish brain ! ) <h> Eat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- possibly because the outsize cutlery created the illusion the diners were eating more food faster , subconsciously compelling them to consume less overall . <p> ( Conversely , British tycoon Alan Sugar swears eating with a tiny fork is the way to go he reasons that smaller cutlery makes you eat slower . However , celebrities might not be the best source of diet advice. ) 
 <p> It 's the fibre in fruit that really separates it from other sweet foods . Even the I Quit Sugar movement , which specifically zeroes in on fructose ( the type of sugar in fruit ) , encourages a small amount of fruit a day because of its fibre and other nutrients . <p> " The fibre , which helps to slow down the digestion of the sugars , plus the water content , can reduce the overall glycemic load from the consumption of fruit , " Landau explains . <p> So unlike other sweet foods , fruit should fill you up and not cause as big a spike then crash in energy levels . <p> But that 's not to say you should subsist on fruit and fruit alone the Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend we stick to about two pieces of fruit per day . <p> A serving size of fruit is about 150g , or around . In everyday terms , that 's a medium apple , banana or orange ; two small kiwi fruits , apricots or plums ; and a cup of diced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Landau says not everybody needs to follow the guidelines to a tee . <p> " I would recommend people look at how the fruit they are consuming fits with the rest of their food choices , " Landau says . <p> " Fruit intake levels to support optimal health will vary based on activity levels , energy needs , genetics and consumption or lack of consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods that make up a person 's total daily energy intake . " <p> When it comes to genetic differences , Landau says different bodies preferentially metabolise certain macronutrients ( fat , carbohydrates and protein ) so she recommends seeing an accredited practicing dietitian if you 're unsure how much fruit you personally need . <p> People with diabetes particularly need to keep close tabs on their overall carbohydrate intake of which fruit is a part to keep their blood sugar levels steady . <p> " Fruit intake , as with any other carbohydrate-based foods , needs to be calculated to fit in with the acceptable daily levels of carbohydrate consumption , " Landau explains . 
 <h> The everyday habits that increase your chances of obesity <p> There 's no single behaviour that makes you overweight or obese however , there are a cluster of not-so-healthy behaviours linked to an increased likelihood of being overweight or obese . <p> Watching TV while you eat is a prime example : according to research from the Ohio Colleges of Medicine Government Resource Center , adults who have their meals in front of the television are 37 percent more likely to be obese than those who are n't . ( The effect holds true for people who watch videos , so do n't think you can worm out of this one by watching YouTube or Netflix . ) The study 's lead author Rachel Tumin suggested it might be because you subconsciously eat more when you 're distracted by the TV. 
 <h> Artificial sweeteners : everything you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask <p> Here 's a rundown of the good and the bad of the different varieties , with a dietitian 's verdict about their use . <h> Aspartame <p> One of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners in the world , aspartame is used to sweeten all manner of foods and soft drinks , thanks to the fact that a little goes a long way it 's 200 times sweeter than table sugar . <p> It 's made by combining two amino acids -- aspartic acid and phenylalanine and given just a smidgen is ridiculously sweet , you only need a drop of it to sweeten foods without increasing the calories like sugar does . <p> You 're probably familiar with it in the form of Equal or Nutra Sweet , and it 's often used in diet soft drinks , lollies , desserts and yoghurts . <p> Rumours have suggested excess consumption is linked with brain tumours however many studies have proved this incorrect , and world health authorities ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Cancer Society ) have approved it for consumption , except for people with the rare genetic disorder phenylketonuria . <p> But while aspartame sounds great in theory , accredited practicing dietitian Maria Packard told Coach that you still need to look at foods as a whole . <p> " Be mindful that the foods and drinks that have artificial sweeteners should n't replace more nutrient-dense choices in your eating plan , " says Packard , who is a spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia . <p> " So if you are going to have chocolate , even sugar-free chocolate is a discretionary food it 's not contributing important nutrients to your food intake that are important . It 's still a treat food . " <h> Sucralose <p> Sucralose , which is derived from sugar , is commonly known as Splenda and is a whopping 600 times sweeter than table sugar . <p> It 's often used by food manufacturers in lollies and soft drinks , and passes mostly unchanged through the digestive tract , meaning most of it is eliminated . <p> A 2013 study into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day could have a negative effect on gut bacteria , while two cans could lead to malabsorption of medication . <p> Given the fact that " intense sweeteners " ( as they are officially known ) are approved for use by FSANZ in Australia , Packard is less concerned about their safety and more concerned with how people tend to consume them . <p> " I look at what my clients are having it in if they prefer some artificial sweetener on their porridge instead of sugar or in yoghurt , then they are getting lots of other nutrients with it , " she says . <p> " But if it 's because they want lots of diet soft drink , I 'm not really going to be encouraging that . I 'm looking at the whole picture and the other nutrients that might come with that . " <h> Saccharin <p> The oldest artificial sweetener in the book saccharin has been around since 1870 and was commonly used during sugar shortages in World War I. <p> It was discovered inadvertently by chemist Constantin Fahlberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch tasted super sweet thanks to the saccharin residue left on his hands . <p> Roughly 200-700 times as sweet as regular sugar , you 'll find it in jelly , jam , gum , canned fruit , salad dressings and dessert toppings . It can have a bitter or metallic aftertaste . <p> It has a long shelf-life , so it 's often combined with aspartame in things like diet soft drinks to retain the sweetness after aspartame fades due to its shorter shelf-life . <p> For a long time , saccharin was thought to be associated with increased bladder cancer risk and was even banned for a period in the US . However subsequent studies have found the findings do n't translate to humans . <p> Some research has suggested that saccharin may alter gut bacteria , whereas stevia does n't so if that 's of concern to you , Diabetes.co.uk suggests using stevia instead . <h> Stevia <p> Extracted from sunflower plants native to Central and South America , stevia has been used as a sweetener for centuries . <p> Two tablespoons have the equivalent sweetness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no effect on blood glucose levels , making it a preferred sweetener for people with diabetes . <p> " Like aspartame and saccharine , stevia is classified as a non-nutritive sweetener , which means it 's kilojoule-free and there 's no nutrition associated with it , " Packard explains . <p> " It 's also often combined with cane sugar to lower the kilojoules compared to regular sugar it 's in products like and Smart Sugar . " <h> Xylitol <p> Xylitol is a sugar alcohol , meaning it 's made of a sugar molecule and an alcohol molecule , and is used in sugar-free gum and lollies as well as home baking . <p> Xylitol is extracted from the fibrous material of fruit and grains and can be swapped one-for-one in recipes . <p> According to I Quit Sugar , it 's on the " okay " list as long as it has n't been used with other artificial sweeteners . Be warned though , too much xylitol can have a laxative effect . <h> Erythritol <p> Another sugar alcohol , erythritol is made by fermenting glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories than xylitol so is often favoured by people watching their weight and diabetics , plus it does n't damage teeth , but it can cause bloating , diarrhoea and wind . <h> The dietitian 's verdict <p> Packard says that it comes down to individual preference whether people consume intense sweeteners . <p> Ultimately , she prefers people cut down on their treat foods altogether -- and if they do want something sweet , to just enjoy a small amount of their favourite thing , then move on . <p> " Just because it has an alternative or artificial sweetener in it , does n't mean you can have as much as you like , " she says . <p> " Read the labels it could still be high in saturated fat or salt . It 's still important to consider the whole food and your other nutrient intake . " <p> Packard is confident in FSANZ 's approval process deeming artificial sweeteners as safe for consumption , but she says they certainly wo n't add nutrition to your diet . <p> She says they can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetics can have small amounts of sugar where sweeteners come in is if people want to have super sweet foods , such as soft drinks . <p> " Where sugar is in large concentrations , like soft drink , swapping to a sugar-free version every now and then , wo n't give them the spike in blood glucose levels , " she says . <p> " But you could get your sweetness from other things , such as putting berries in porridge . " <p> As for suggestions that intense sweeteners cause us to crave more sweet foods and eat more , US researchers suggest the evidence is n't there . <p> " Participants did not compensate by eating more at either their lunch or dinner meal when they consumed lower calorie preloads containing stevia or aspartame compared to when they consumed higher calorie preloads containing sucrose , " Dr Stephen Anton from the University of Florida wrote in the journal Appetite . <p> " In other words , even after a lower calorie preload , food intake at subsequent lunch and dinner meals was not increased and discretionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our findings suggest that using stevia or aspartame in place of sucrose ( i.e. sugar ) in the diet may be an effective strategy to manage food intake since hunger and satiety levels .

 <h> Taking probiotic supplements works -- but only if you eat a lot of junk <p> The probiotics market is growing but whether or not to bother with probiotic supplements or medicine is a hot health question . <p> Probiotics are live " good " bacteria that have a beneficial impact when they 're introduced to the body . ( Prebiotics are essentially what you consume to feed these bacteria . ) They 're found in a lot of foods , in yoghurt-like supplements , and in medicine-like capsules . <p> There 's a lot of work happening right now to determine exactly how probiotics work and what effect they have inside your body . New research indicates they do work -- but there 's a catch . <p> According to scientists from the University of New South Wales , probiotic medicines will probably do you good ... if you have a bad diet . If you have a good diet , they wo n't make you even better . In fact , they could make you worse . <p> A team led by Professor Margaret Morris , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different diets some which included nutritious " chow " ( mmm , sounds appetising ) , and others which included junk food high in added sugar and bad fats . <p> The rats also received either high or low doses of probiotic medicine . <p> The junk food rats ' terrible diets wrought terrible damage on the diversity of their gut bacteria , but taking the probiotics undid a lot of that harm . ( Other research has indicated having a diverse range of " helpful " gut bacteria is super important for good health ) . <p> But the healthy-eating rats who took a probiotic did n't see any significant benefit to their gut microbiome but to Professor Morris 's surprise , these rats ' memories got worse , possibly because of gut bacteria 's effect on the brain and how genes are activated there . <p> " If you 're eating really badly then probiotics might be helpful . But if you 're already eating healthily , they may not be that beneficial , " she said in a statement . <p> " Although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeaway message is that we need to exercise caution when we recommend that people take probiotics . <p> " It 's very hard for us to say that they are definitively good or bad . Probiotics may offer a great opportunity to improve health so long as they are replacing the correct bacteria the challenge is accurately determining which beneficial microbes are absent . " <p> So as usual , the moral of the story for otherwise healthy people is : before you consider taking a probiotic or any other kind of supplement , first make sure you 're eating a balanced diet that includes good stuff every day and " bad " stuff in moderation . 
 <h> Feeling stressed ? Eat your veggies especially if you 're a woman <p> If juggling the demands of work , family , health and god knows what else is getting you down , a simple strategy could help you chill out : eat three-to-four serves of vegetables a day . <p> That 's the conclusion University of Sydney researchers came to after analysing diet and mental health data drawn from more than 60,000 Australians . <p> " This study shows that moderate daily fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with lower rates of psychological stress , " said Dr Melody Ding of the University of Sydney 's School of Public Health , whose finding is published in the British Medical Journal Open . <p> But while both fruit and vegetables have impressive all-round health benefits , it 's veggies that seem to be the key to defeating stress . <p> While eating three-to-four daily serves of only vegetables was linked to a 12 percent drop in stress risk , and eating five-to-seven daily serves of vegetables and fruit was linked to a 14 percent drop , eating only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to the study , one gender in particular is better off eating their veggies . <p> " We found that fruit and vegetables were more protective for women than men , suggesting that women may benefit more from fruit and vegetables , " said first author and University of Sydney PhD student Binh Nguyen . <p> For women who ate three-to-four serves of vegetables , that drop in stress risk rose to 18 percent . <p> The University of Sydney investigators added that future studies will need to explore whether there 's a " threshold " between medium and higher levels of fruit and vegetables and psychological stress . <p> It 's not just about fruit and vegetables , either . Earlier this year , Victorian researchers found that improving the overall quality of your diet ( more fresh produce , more lean protein , more wholegrains ) is a valuable tool for treating depression . 
 <h> A cup of tea every day could keep your brain healthy and shield against dementia <p> If you 're that person who ca n't make it through the afternoon without a good cuppa , you 're more likely to stay sharp into old age : new research suggests a daily cup of tea keeps older people 's brains healthy and protects against dementia . <p> A National University of Singapore study published in The Journal of Nutrition , Health &amp; Aging determined that drinking tea reduces the risk of cognitive impairment in older persons by 50 per cent and as much as 86 per cent for those who are genetically predisposed to Alzheimer 's . <p> " The data from our study suggests that a simple and inexpensive lifestyle measure such as daily tea drinking can reduce a person 's risk of developing neurocognitive disorders in late life , " boasted Assistant Professor Feng Lei , who led the study . <p> Assistant Professor Feng and his team reached their conclusion by studying 957 Chinese people aged 55 years or older over a period of two years , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnicities . <p> That 's good news because , in his words , " effective pharmacological therapy for neurocognitive disorders such as dementia remains elusive and current prevention strategies are far from satisfactory " . 
 <h> Do n't be fooled : why ' low fat ' and ' reduced sugar ' do n't mean what you think they mean <p> Hands up if you 've done this : " It 's fine to slip this into my shopping trolley , because the label says it has no fat ! " Or : " It 's fine I ate all of those , because the packet says they 're low calorie ! " <p> We all have a hand raised right now -- maybe two . <p> According to a team of US nutritionists , food packaging terms like " no fat " , " no sugar " and " low calories " lull us into a false sense of confidence that what we 're eating is healthy but do n't actually indicate a food 's true nutrition values . <p> " Our results demonstrate that for packaged foods and beverages , purchases featuring ' low ' or ' reduced ' nutrients claims do not necessarily offer the better overall nutrition implied by the claim , " said the study 's lead investigator Dr Lindsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of North Carolina , in a statement . <p> " This is likely due in part to ' reduced ' claims only being relative within brands or specific food categories , while ' low ' claims are relative to portion size , " she said . <p> What that means is that nutrition claims like " low fat " are often made by comparing a food to a similar product instead of taking its overall nutrition value into account , resulting in a distorted impression of how healthy that food actually is . <p> The researchers analysed more than 80 million food and beverage purchases from more than 40,000 American households to reach the conclusion that products with claims are n't always the most nutritious . <p> The example cited in their research is reduced-fat Oreos ( not sold in Australian supermarkets ) , which do indeed have less fat than regular Oreo cookies ( 4.5g per serve , compared to 7g per serve ) but the same amount of sugar ( 14g per serve ) , cancelling out any health benefit of eating the lower-fat variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touted as a lower-calorie alternative but the difference between a thin cookie ( 35 calories each ) and a regular cookie ( 42 calories each ) is tiny . Yeah , it 's technically true Thins are lower-calorie , but the difference is so small it 's also kinda misleading . <p> ( A classic example is low-fat yoghurt , which often compensates for stripping out the fat by packing in added sugar meaning you could end up consuming more calories in your attempt to consume less calories . ) <h> Food labels to look out for <p> The takeaway from the research is n't that you should outright reject all products with labels like " low fat " or " no sugar " ( or that you should never eat Oreos , because Oreos are delicious ) . It 's just that you need to be aware that labels do n't necessarily reveal a food 's complete health picture . <p> One label Taillie 's team highlighted is " reduced sugar " , which is becoming increasingly common as the anti-sugar movement gathers momentum . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to Alpha Biscuits , but more sugar compared to Beta Biscuits . ( There is no such thing as Alpha Biscuits and Beta Biscuits , but do n't you kind of wish there was now ? ) <p> Claims of " reduced " or " light " anything are a minefield , because " reduced fat " or " lower energy/calorie " are also relative they do n't really tell you anything about how much total fat , energy or sugar a product has . <p> And while labels like " low fat " and " low sodium " are strictly defined by law , they also do n't indicate much about a food 's other nutrient values . The researchers ' example is a " low-fat " cookie , which might still have more calories , fat or sodium than other cookies . <p> " In other words , ' low- , ' ' reduced- ' or ' no- ' nutrient claims mean different things for different foods , " said Taillie . <p> " This can produce confusion if consumers are seeking out products with specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of food . In fact , the data suggest that in some cases , products that tend to be high in calories , sodium , sugar or fat actually may be more likely to have low- , reduced- or no-content claims . " 
 <h> The most important sleep habit of them all : a routine <p> Knowing you have to get a good night 's sleep is the most annoying health bugbear of all : ? yes , we all know we 've got to stop chatting on the damn internet , yes we know there 's no point staying up to watch yet another episode on Netflix , and yes we know that if we do n't go to bed right this instant we 'll spend the whole next day in a zombie-like stupor . <p> But ... we all do it anyway . <p> So what can we do to break the cycle of ? According to Dr Andrew Rochford , the answer is surprisingly simple : you 've got set yourself a sleep routine , and stick to it like white on rice . <p> " I do n't think having a sleep routine is just important for your health I think it 's the most important thing , " Rochford tells Coach . <p> " Sleep is the foundation upon which you build all other facets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships and even your performance at work . " <p> It sounds absurd , but people who got a solid eight hours of restful sleep had the same physical and mental uplift as someone who had just won $300,000 . <p> Despite the extreme benefits of restful slumber , research commissioned by Koala has found that less than one in five Aussies are getting a good night 's sleep , with 47 percent of us admit to not having a sleep routine at all . <p> For most of us , waking up involves a complex series of iPhone alarms that coincide with equally complex pushes of the snooze button but Rochford says constantly delaying the time you get out of bed is a big no-no . <p> " Hitting the snooze button is also not a great idea it 's a little like torturing yourself every day , " laughs Rochford . <p> Of course , being so regimented in your daily life that you fall asleep and wake up at the exact same time every day of your life is nigh on impossible , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having a sleep routine is an excellent way to remind yourself to be as consistent as you can with what time you wake up and go to sleep , " says Rochford . <p> " Obviously that 's not possible every day we 've all had nights out that ended at 3am -- but as much as possible it 's great to get into a routine of going to bed and waking up at the same time . " <p> Every man and his dog knows that cutting short the amount of hours you spend in the sack is a good way to wake up cranky but few realise what 's happening inside our bodies when we push it to the limit . <p> " If you do n't get a good night 's sleep , there 's a whole variety of factors fighting against you . You tend to make poorer decisions , you 're more likely to eat the wrong foods , and you 've got less energy to exercise , " says Rochford . <p> " Your risk of mental health issues also increases as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Setting up a sleep routine does n't have to be as complicated as over Himalayan healing crystals -- anything that eases the multitude of swirling thoughts in your head will suffice . <p> " Like anything , getting into a good sleep routine is a process it 's quite similar to warming up for physical activity in that it becomes something you do every day , " recommends Rochford . <p> " To help your body wind down , try and avoid any exercise that 's really high intensity , and mentally relax by taking a hot shower or a soak in the tub . <p> " Many people go to bed physically relaxed but lie there awake pondering their day relaxing your mind is half the battle . " 
 <h> Why yoga is so good at calming us down <p> It often seems like , to some degree , everyone is stressed , anxious , or depressed . But there 's a simple treatment to ease those feelings : yoga . <p> A small study by Harvard and Columbia University suggests regular yoga practice reduces the symptoms of depression , a finding that backs up a lot of previous research . <p> Published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine , the new study randomly assigned 30 people with major depressive disorder ( aka clinical depression ) into two groups : one that did two 90-minute yoga sessions a week , and the other that did three sessions a week . <p> Both groups ' depressive symptoms declined " significantly " on average , but the effect was especially strong in the three-times-a-week group . ( The only negative side-effect observed in the study was some sore muscles . ) <p> The finding is no surprise to regulars on the yoga mat . <p> Lara Zilibowitz , a Sydney yoga teacher and co-founder of Back2Roots Retreats , tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " , because it proves what she instinctively believes , and " Of course ! " , because she sees yoga 's positive effects on people 's mental wellbeing almost every day . <p> " What I 've witnessed with students , and experienced along my own journey , is that yoga can start to provide a gateway towards understanding what 's going on not only in our physical but also our psychological and emotional bodies , as well as providing tools for coping , " she says . <p> believes yoga provides such profound mental benefits because it cultivates " curious , meditative concentration " that teaches us to " observe without reacting " , a skill that can then be used to guide us when we 're not practising yoga . <p> " We learn to sit with often intense sensation or feel emotions until often they move through us and out of us , " she explains . In fact , those emotions released during yoga can be so powerful it 's common for people to cry on their mats . <p> " Mostly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because there 's a ' story ' , " says . " It 's simply a release of pent-up emotional or psychological stress stored in the soma , the cellular memory of the tissue . " <h> Yoga 's effect on the body <p> We 've all floated out of a yoga class on a cloud of calm inner peace , which Zilibowitz says is because the practice reduces stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to induce what 's known as the relaxation response essentially the opposite of fight-or-flight . <p> " It 's only once the relaxation response kicks in that instead of trying to escape our feelings , we can stay with them , which is essential to identifying the psychological factors that trigger anxiety and depression , " she says . <p> " As well as triggering the relaxation response , yoga helps raise levels of oxytocin , a hormone that reduces blood pressure and improves the levels of GABA , a neurotransmitter that tends to be low in people who suffer from depression and anxiety . " <p> Just one yoga class can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that , as suggested by the Harvard and Columbia research , more frequent yoga sessions over a longer period will deliver heightened benefits . <p> " How long that takes will be different for each practitioner , but it does take discipline , " she says . " If we can , we aim to roll out the mat at least 3-4 times a week . " <h> What type of yoga is best ? <p> The type of yoga in the Harvard/Columbia study was Iyengar yoga , which Zilibowitz explains emphasises precision and detail of both the physical postures ( asanas ) and breath control ( pranayama ) . <p> " What would be valuable about this style for people struggling with mental illness , or injury of any kind , is that the practice is specifically tailored to the student , " she says . " Often it uses props such as straps , blocks and blankets , allowing the student to feel supported and safe . " <p> tells Coach she 's particularly passionate about mindful Vinyasa yoga , which she describes as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my own journey battling post-traumatic stress symptoms of anxiety and insomnia . " <p> But more important than the specific style of yoga is finding the right yoga environment we 've all been in that yoga class which seems more about rushing through a workout than about cultivating a quality headspace . <p> " This is really missing the point . Rather than running away from what is uncomfortable , yoga is about paying attention to sensation , and learning to harness your awareness and use the breath to release stress in the body and the mind , " Zilibowitz says . <p> " What 's probably most essential is you find a yoga teacher who 's compassionate and creates a nurturing environment where you feel accepted , without any shame , without having to prove yourself in any way . " <h> Breathing is the key <p> How you feel changes how you breathe , and stress whether it 's emotional or physical has a huge effect on that pattern . <p> " Typically , an anxious person takes small , shallow breaths , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of their lungs , " says . " This only makes the physical symptoms of stress worse as we ca n't get enough oxygen around the body . " <p> But the link also works in the other direction : how you breathe changes how you feel . Research has shown that controlled or conscious breathing is a valuable tool for quelling anxiety , with techniques such as 4-7-8 breathing able to induce calm in a minute or less . <p> says yoga 's focus on breathing explains in part why it 's so soothing is its focus on breath : conscious , deep breathing triggers the parasympathetic nervous system ( which oversees the processes that happen in your body when you 're at rest ) , sparking that relaxation response . <p> Controlled breathing 's effects are n't just physiological , but mental , and it 's a " simple and profound " tool that can be used outside a yoga studio . <p> " Controlled breathing is a powerful technique to settle the mind , to move away from the worries and fluctuating thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we concentrate on each aspect of the breathing process , we are present ; we let go of the past and future and are focused on the moment inside the breath .

 <h> Stretching : The best types to do before and after your workout <p> Whether you 're loosening your hammy after a big run or aiming for a lithe yoga pose like a pro , you 've probably given stretching a go to try reduce soreness , increase performance or build flexibility . <p> But not all stretches are created equal . According to physiotherapist Holly Brasher , there are quite a few stretching furphies being bandied about , which could be leading people to injury or just time wasting . <p> Here 's what you need to know about stretching when to do it , how to do it and what it 's good for . <h> Flexibility is the aim of the stretching game <p> You might pull a stretch in an effort to reduce your chance of delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) the next day , but interestingly , Brasher says there is no evidence that stretching stops next-day stiffness . <p> " When we look at the research , stretching does not provide any effective injury prevention it actually has a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it does n't prevent DOMS , " she explains . <p> Rather , Brasher says stretching ought to be seen as a way of improving range of motion and releasing tight muscles . <p> " The aim of stretching is to try and increase flexibility or muscle extensibility , " she explains . <p> " Why we would be stretching is probably to do with muscle tightness or to increase range of motion around a joint . " <h> 2 . Dynamic stretching <p> Dynamic or moving stretches are what you want to do prior to playing netball or footy , or doing a big gym sesh , in order to activate the muscles you will be using in your workout , as well as improve range of motion . <p> It involves things like lunging and twisting , high kicks , shoulder circles and side bends . <p> " Just remember -- dynamic before , static after , " Brasher says . <h> 3 . PNF <p> " PNF increases the stretch of the muscle that attaches to the bone because the muscle is contracted , then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to take the muscle to a further stretch , " Brasher explains . <p> Research suggests PNF is more effective than static stretching , and you can use a wall or band to DIY if you do n't have access to a partner . Be sure to choose that partner carefully -- someone like a personal trainer because someone who does n't know what they 're doing could apply too much pressure in the wrong spot and inadvertently injure you . <h> What happens if you do n't stretch ? <p> You wo n't necessarily have an increased risk of injury , but Brasher says not stretching could leave you stiff or with a muscle imbalance . <p> " When there 's stiffness or tightness or lack of range of motion around certain areas of the body , it will load other parts when you need to move , " she says . <p> So if you suffer tight hammies , you would n't be able to get enough flexion in the hips to sit comfortably in a chair . <p> " You will actually need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You end up sitting with a flexed low back , which puts a passive strain on some of the structures in the back and can cause problems in the low back . " <p> But if you stretch regularly , Brasher says you will likely remain more agile and flexible plus stretching often feels so good . <p> " Some people have tighter bodies that need a lot of stretching to feel good and that 's not going to do any harm , " Brasher says . <p> Brasher says how much you stretch ultimately comes down to your individual body type . <p> " Some people tend to be really stiff and when they get pain or injury then doing a lot of stretching or yoga might be the best thing to help them , " she explains . <p> " But other people have a body type that 's quite floppy and really hypermobile and sending them off to do some stretching is not going to be appropriate . They 're going to respond more to strength work and improved core stability . " 
 <p> It may come as a surprise , but one of the biggest benefits of following a Mediterranean diet is the greater social inclusion that it encourages . Italian researchers discovered that the traditional past-time of sharing a communal bowl of pasta - even if it was just once a week - lowered the risk of depression , prevented overeating and improved mood . When eating with others , we suddenly become much more mindful of how and what we eat compared to mindlessly chewing away in front of the TV. 
 <h> Why intense exercise makes some people vomit <p> " How many burpees do we have left ? " you ask the trainer hesitantly , feeling the bile rise in your throat . <p> " Because I 'm not really feeling that well ... " <p> Then , before you know it , you 're running to the closest rubbish bin to vomit in front of all your super-cool CrossFit buddies . <p> Yes , vomiting after or during exercise is a pretty rare event but why does it happen ? Is it your body and mind physically rejecting the thought of working out so hard , or is there some complex physiological factor at play ? <p> The answer , frustratingly , is " it depends " . As exercise physiologist Professor Rob Newton explains , vomiting or feeling nauseous during an intense session is pretty much your body 's way of telling you that you 're doing too much , too soon . <p> " The onset of nausea with exercise is related to the intensity of the exercise , duration of the exercise bout and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach . <p> " All three of these factors interact to potentially produce a situation in which the homeostasis , or internal chemical balance within the body , is so disrupted that it can cause feelings of nausea . " <p> Of course , Newton is quick to point out that going from couch potato to fitness fanatic overnight is n't the only reason why you might feel sick , because that enormous bowl of pasta you smashed just minutes before walking into the gym could be to blame , too . <p> " Eating or drinking too much to close to the exercise session can cause nausea and indigestion with even relatively low-intensity exercise , " says Newton . <p> " Similarly , exercising on an empty stomach after fasting all night can also cause nausea during exercise . " <p> Experts speculate that part of the reason that you feel the urge to vom during a particularly strenuous set of jump squats is that blood is actively being moved away from your gut into your limbs causing your stomach to delay its normal process of " emptying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're really , really full ( even if you have n't eaten anything at all ) and your bodily cue to vomit activates in order to purge this " fullness " . <p> Thankfully , Newton says this event should be extremely rare especially if you 're not a professional athlete so if you 're feeling nauseous regularly when exercising you should tone down the intensity and book a visit with your GP . <p> " For the vast majority of people wishing simply to maintain or increase their fitness and to become healthier there is absolutely no reason to exercise at such an intensity , " says Newton . <p> " Yes there will be the odd exercise session where you push a little bit too hard and do n't allow sufficient recovery between exercise bouts , but this should be a rare occurrence .

 <h> The brutal training schedule of cricketing star Holly Ferling <p> Cricket training does n't exactly inspire warrior-like images of athletes sweating it out in the gym , but the demands placed on the players of the all-new WBBL would make even the most fervent of gym rats think twice . <p> As up-and-coming Brisbane Heat fast bowler and Milo ambassador Holly Ferling told Coach , the days where cricket training meant a few lazy nets sessions and a lap around the oval are well and truly over . <p> " I 'm training approximately four-plus hours a day on top of meetings with coaches , sports psychologists and nutritionists , " Ferling tells Coach . <p> " Skills such as batting , bowling and fielding take many hours of practice to make sure that I 'm at the top of my game . " <p> For Ferling who is now a professional athlete focusing on cricket full-time the demands of the game have reached such a high point that training every day is now a necessity to compete with the best . <p> " Playing competitive cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early starts , the long hours , hard training sessions , then backed up by study during the day . At times it can be hard , however , I could n't imagine my life any other way ! " says Ferling . <p> " However , it has also taught me many life lessons . I try to be the very best I can at everything I do , so time management is always key for me . " <p> It 's just as well Ferling is on top of her routine , because anybody except a professional athlete would find it hard to juggle multiple gym and cardio sessions a week on top of her team training . <p> " As you can imagine fitness is a key component when competing as a professional athlete . My training regime required me to be in the gym three times a week for one to two-hour strength sessions , " explains Ferling . <p> " My cardio requirements change weekly , depending on the week 's cricket training demands , but it usually ends up being two to three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an individual rehabilitation program that I need to complete to ensure that I strengthen my physical weaknesses in particular my elbow . " <p> From long hours endlessly bowling balls in the nets to brutal gym sessions to strengthen and injury-proof her body , Ferling attributes much of her success to her attitude . <p> " Like every sport , cricket has its ups and downs it is n't always smooth sailing , " explains Ferling . <p> " Similar to life , cricket has its consequences for performance , including injuries . All I can do is control what I can , believe in myself , my abilities , enjoy what I do as the rest will all take care of itself . <p> " It 's taken me a while to learn this , and it is something that I am still always learning . " <p> Ferling 's mindset , coupled with her commitment to training , has seen her race up the rankings of women 's cricket a feat she wishes will be made easier for girls in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional cricketer is to get out there and have a go ! " says Ferling . <p> " Before I joined my first Milo junior cricket program and my first club with all of the boys , I would never have thought I 'd end up playing for the Australian team . <p> " The advice I always give is to always enjoy the sport you play and make it fun . The higher up you get professionally , the more serious and sometimes stressful it gets . <p> " At the professional level , I think the most critical thing to success is sometimes forgotten -- that we play sport because it is fun . " 
 <h> Busy , busy , busy : Having no time is the ultimate modern-day status symbol <p> " I 've just been so busy lately . " We all say this so often it 's become a defining mantra of the modern age regardless of how true it is . <p> An intriguing new study from Harvard and Columbia University researchers indicates why we 're all so boastful about our lack of free time : because being busy has evolved into a coveted status symbol . <p> Whereas back in the day you 'd to slip in mentions of your material excess or endless leisure time to boost your social currency , now we 're more likely to humblebrag that we have no life and we 're desperate for a holiday because we 're so overworked . <p> " The more we believe that people have the opportunity for social affirmation based on hard work , the more we tend to think that people who skip leisure and work all the time are of higher standing , " wrote the study 's authors Silvia Bellezza of Columbia University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Translated into English , that means we 've come to attach being flat-out all the time with high social status traditionally , goods that are scarce in number are more highly valued , but nowadays , people who are scarce on time have become more highly valued . <p> " People 's social-mobility beliefs are psychologically driven by the perception that busy individuals possess desirable characteristics , leading them to be viewed as scarce and in demand , " the study authors said . <p> The researchers explored this phenomenon by studying both Americans ( who generally associate being busy at work with high status ) and Italians ( who still associated a life of leisure with high status ) . <p> Bragging about busyness was found to have an intriguing flow-on effect : brands that claim to save time for busy people ( such as online shopping and food delivery services ) have come to signal high status just as much as expensive brands . <p> In Australia , it feels increasingly common for us to talk about how busy we are -- being social , staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than 40 percent of us work more than 40 hours a week , and 13 percent work more than 50 a week despite recent research suggesting 39 hours of work is a week is the upper limit for good health . <p> The OECD gives our work-life balance a score of 5.9 -- slightly poorer than the United States ( 6.2 ) , and well under most western European countries , which mostly rank 8 and above . 
 <h> I did the beep test again as an adult . It 's just as awful as I remembered <p> It 's funny how you can be a pretty well-adjusted adult ( or at least feel like you 're doing a passable impression of one ) , but all it takes is for one little thing to rocket you back to your rabidly insecure , self-conscious , gawky teenage years . <p> For me , that thing was the beep test . <p> Earlier this week Team Coach participated in the launch of Powerade 's Powerscore , a test of fitness skills that allows athletes of different abilities to benchmark themselves against each other . Most of it was standard , stuff : a test of agility , a vertical leap test of power , and a sprinting test of speed . <p> All of which confirmed that , despite decent levels of fitness and strength I have developed as an adult , I am still the same uncoordinated , **25;1104;TOOLONG person I always was . Which is fine I knew that . <p> But the fourth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angst : the dreaded beep test . <p> On the bright side , I was not alone in that angst . Several other journalists and media types had assembled to find out their Powerscore , and the beep test was the event we agreed we dreaded most -- all of us shared barely repressed memories of being subjected to it back in our school days . <p> For those who do n't know the beep test : Firstly , I envy you . ( How did you avoid this grim high-school rite of passage ? ) Secondly , it 's a common test of fitness endurance also known as a shuttle run , a multistage fitness test , and a legal way to torture people . <p> The reason the beep test is so common is because , like all popular forms of torment , it 's super easy to administer ( there are apps you can use to do it anywhere , if you 're a masochist ) . You set up two markers 20 metres apart , run between them before a beep hence the test 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you can complete . <p> A cruel part about the beep test is that it starts off easy , but ratchets up the difficulty too gradually to consciously notice . <p> At the start , I barely needed to trot to cross the 20m line but as a monotonous male voice counted up the levels , the beeps came closer and closer , and within minutes I was full-on running and wondering how did I reach this point ( kind of like how that boiling frog must 've felt ) . <p> But the cruellest part of the beep test is its sheer gruelling monotony : , , . <p> My final score on the beep test was 8.3 , which is considered " good " . NSW Police recruits need to score higher than 7.1 to qualify for the force , while top athletes can score up in the 15s and beyond . <p> To be honest , I could 've scored higher I was n't that pooped by the end of it . But the beep test is evidently a mental test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where I fell over . <p> Throughout the test my brain kept saying to me , " This is awful . Why are you doing this ? It 's not like you 're being chased by zombies . You should stop . " And my body eventually reached a point where it agreed . So I stopped . <p> Perhaps you 're idly thinking something like : " I also remember hating the beep test in school but I 'm way fitter now , so maybe it 'd be interesting to do it again as an adult . " 
 <h> Here 's a weird side-effect of sleep deprivation : it makes you worse at recognising emotions <p> A bad night 's sleep wo n't just leave you struggling to stay awake through work the next day . It could also make you worse at telling if your workmates are happy or sad . <p> That 's the finding from a University of Arizona study , which found that sleep-deprived people are worse at gauging subtle levels of happiness and sadness but not at interpreting other emotions like anger , fear , surprise and disgust . <p> William D.S. Killgore , a professor of psychiatry who led the study , speculated it 's because distinguishing happiness and sadness is n't that important , at least from an evolutionary sense . <p> Back in humanity 's " caveman " days , we always needed to be able to pick up whether someone was murderously angry at us , or surprised or angry at the sabre-tooth tiger behind us , or disgusted by the poisonous berries we just ate , regardless of how tired we felt -- otherwise , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be , uh , entirely historically accurate . ) <p> But since intuiting whether they were in a good mood or feeling blue probably did n't make much difference to our immediate survival if we were feeling a li'l sleepy , we never evolved that ability . <p> " If someone is going to hurt you , even when you 're sleep deprived you should still be able to pick up on that , " Killgore said in a statement . <p> " Reading whether somebody is sad or not is really not that important in that acute danger situation , so if anything is going to start to degrade with lack of sleep it might be the ability to recognise those social emotions . " <p> The University of Arizona team used a quirky method to reach their finding , which emerged from Killgore 's wider research into how sleep deprivation affects our social , emotional and moral judgement . <p> They showed 54 participants photographs of the same man 's face expressing extremes of happiness , sadness , fear , anger , surprise and disgust which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep deprived they were . <p> But the participants were also asked to interpret more subtle emotional expressions , which were created by a computer program that fused the extreme facial expressions together -- so participants were shown a face that was 70 percent sadness and 30 percent disgust , for example , and asked to identify what they thought was the dominant emotion . <p> Some of the composite images shown to the study 's participants ( Neurobiology of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms via University of Arizona ) <p> Ultimately , the sleep-deprived participants had a harder time identifying subtle expressions of happiness and sadness an ability that returned after they 'd had a decent night 's sleep . <p> Killgore argues that 's important because most Americans ( and most Australians ) do n't get the recommended seven to nine hours ' sleep per night which could explain why everybody seems totally oblivious to the fact that they 're annoying the hell out of you . <p> " You may be responding inappropriately to somebody that you just do n't read correctly , especially those social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as empathic , " Killgore said . <p> " Your spouse or significant other may need something from you and you 're less able to read that . It 's possible that this could lead to problems in your relationships or problems at work . To me , that is one of the biggest problems how this affects our relationships . " 
 <h> Shift work : How to stop it ruining your sleep cycle and your life <p> We 're forever hearing about the importance of getting a solid seven to nine hours ' shut-eye each night and syncing our body clock with daylight hours . <p> But if you 're a shift worker , your response to that information is likely a ruder version of " Gee , thanks " as you try to survive the challenges that come with working when most other people are sleeping ( or playing ) . <p> On average , shift workers get two to three hours less sleep than other workers , but some will be robbed of as much as four hours of sleep a day . <p> But the good news is , there are ways of helping your body fare better . <h> Why shift work mucks with us <p> We 're not nocturnal by nature and our bodies are set to function in sync with daylight and night . <p> When sunlight streams in , our brains register that it 's daylight and stop producing the sleep hormone melatonin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also tend to run a cooler body temperature during the night , which facilitates sleep , while a hotter body temperature during the day can make it harder to drift off . <p> Not only can these biological effects make you feel sluggish and not on your A-game but research shows that shift workers are also at higher risk of obesity , cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal problems . <p> Not to mention the fact losing sleep can make you behave like you 've had a few too many beers . <p> According to the Sleep Health Foundation , going 17 hours without sleep has the equivalent impact on your behaviour as having a blood alcohol content of 0.05 percent . If you stay awake a full 24 hours then it 's like you 've got a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent . <p> Here 's how to counteract these effects to try keep as energetic and healthy as possible if you 're a shift worker . <h> Follow a routine <p> Sleep psychologist Dr Moira Jung , spokesperson for the Sleep Health Foundation , told Coach that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine as possible . <p> It 's better for your body clock if you work the same shifts all the time a rotating roster is the hardest timetable for our circadian rhythm to adjust to . <p> " Everything from our bowel patterns to our appetite to our mood is regulated on a 24-hour cycle , " Dr Jung explains . <p> " If you work the same set hours , you would n't be really bothered by it because you would have a regularity with your hours . " <h> Plan your nutrition <p> You might not be having breakfast , lunch and dinner at the same time as everybody else , but Dr Jung says it 's crucial that shift workers plan meals to ensure they 're getting adequate nutrition to prevent them becoming another obesity statistic . <p> " If it 's 3am when you get your lunchbreak and you do n't have anything on hand , then of course you 're going to go to the vending machine , " she says . <p> " Consult a dietitian about what you need to eat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge and lunchbox . " <h> Keep exercising <p> There are now 24-hour gyms on every second street corner , which can be mighty helpful for shift workers . <p> " Often people say ' I 'm too tired to exercise ' but exercising will counteract some of the sleepiness , " Dr Jung says . <p> " You need to plan for it and prioritise it in your calendar . " <h> Stay social <p> If you always seem to be working when everyone else is playing , it can be difficult to maintain a social life . However Dr Jung says the importance of human interaction ca n't be underestimated . <p> " It 's one of the big pillars of our health , " she says . <p> " Do regular health checks with yourself because you might not realise you 're becoming socially isolated and potentially more depressed . " <p> So even if you ca n't make the Saturday night engagement party , could you schedule a Sunday brunch or afternoon walk to keep you in the loop with your mates ? <h> Power nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your work break or a power nap in the afternoon before you clock on , Dr Jung says napping can really fire you up . <p> " If you sleep for shorter periods , it does n't interfere with your longer sleep period at night , " she says . <p> " Two hours is not a nap in my book a nap is a 30-minute maximum thing . " 
 <h> Alkaline water : Should you make the switch ? <p> It does n't seem enough to high five ourselves for getting eight glasses of water down the hatch these days . Now it seems we ought to ensure our water has the appropriate pH so we do n't accidentally tip our body into an acidic state . <p> Alkaline water , aka ionised water , is getting plenty of attention in the natural health sector . Its proponents claim the fact it has a pH of around 9 could not just increase our but even prevent cancer and diabetes . <p> ( If you forgot high-school chemistry , pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity . On the pH scale of 1 to 14 , 7 is the pH of pure water ; every whole value below that is increasingly acidic , and every whole value above it is more alkaline " . A healthy human body has a pH of a little over 7 . ) <p> Alkaline water is created by running water through an " ionising " machine that contains electrodes that are said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the pH . <p> The idea of drinking alkaline water or following an alkalising diet is that the Western diet is highly acidic , which makes for a breeding ground for infection and disease . <p> If we can take steps to make our bodies more alkaline , such as by drinking alkaline water , then they say we 'll be in a much healthier state . <p> According to Choice , drinking alkaline water wo n't harm you -- but it probably wo n't actually make any difference to your internal pH , given our bodies are experts at keeping our pH between 7.35 and 7.45 no matter what we eat or drink . <p> " If the blood pH goes above this range ( that is , more alkaline ) the lungs help regain control by retaining carbon dioxide ( you breathe more slowly ) and thereby increasing the carbonic acid levels of the blood , while the kidneys increase excretion of bicarbonate in urine , making it more alkaline , " Choice writes on its website . <p> Kara Landau , the Travelling Dietitian , agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy metabolic function . <p> " On the whole , I would recommend people first and foremost simply try to drink adequate water and fluids , to remain hydrated , " she told Coach . <p> " This is of vital importance for our bodies to function at their peaks , and ultimately leave us feeling energised and able to take on the day . " <p> Landau says that different types of water have slight variances in mineral content so some individuals might choose to prioritise alkaline water . <p> " As an example , alkaline water is often higher in calcium and potassium , which someone who is looking to increase bone mineral density or improve their blood pressure may be looking to obtain , " she says . <p> " It is worth noting however , that that there will be ample alternative food sources that are denser options of these micronutrients that could easily be incorporated into your diet . " <p> Naturopath Emma Tippett from Empowered Health believes our bodies function optimally when we 're not too acidic , but she says there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I look at things that cause acidity and inflammation in the body , such as processed foods , lots of sugar and lots of refined grain products , " she says . <p> " That 's why we tell people to eat lots of green veggies because they help to keep the body in a more alkaline state . " <p> Tippett says alkaline water will never be the be-all and end-all of a healthy body , but having it ca n't hurt . <p> " Stress , drinking and smoking are going to put the body into a more acidic state , " she points out . <p> Tippett has a water alkalising machine in her clinic which adds minerals back into the water , but says that filtering water is all most people need to worry about in order to get as clean a source as possible . <p> " It 's definitely going to be beneficial to have more minerals in our body and it 's just another source that we can take in for optimal nutritional status , " she says . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of sugar and no veggies , you 're probably not going to get the full benefit .

 <h> This giant Japanese jungle gym will turn you into a muscle monster <p> Here 's the latest instalment in " international attractions someone needs to build in Australia right now " . <p> This weekend marked the opening of the " Muscle Monster " , an epic course located about hour 's drive out of Tokyo . <p> The first attraction of its kind in Asia , the Muscle Monster is built on the edge of a towering cliff and includes a range of challenges including bouldering , flying foxes and ( perhaps most randomly ) cycling . Do n't worry -- you 're safely buckled into a harness while you 're up there . <p> The multi-level Monster is crowned by a viewing platform that stands 16m above the ground roughly three times the height of a two-story house . <p> " With 92 kinds of activities that can not be played very much in one day and 360 degree spectacular view from the rooftop , there is no doubt that goose bumps will irritate , " boasts the Muscle Monster website ( needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction to open at the Sagamiko Resort Pleasure Forest , and we can all agree that " pleasure forest " sounds way cooler ( and adorably Japanese ) than boring old " amusement park " . 
 <h> Add ' asthma symptoms ' to the lengthening list of things gut bacteria can treat <p> The gut microbiome , aka the trillions of little critters living inside your intestines , is one of the most fascinating health forefronts right now -- because of its startling impact on just about every other system of your body . <p> Research suggests improving the health of your gut bacteria can boost your immune system , positively influence mental health , and according to a world-first study presented at the annual meeting of the Thoracic Society for Australia and New Zealand ( TSANZ ) -- treat asthma . <p> " This is the first time anyone has looked at the impact of altering the gut microbiome on asthma control in humans , " said TSANZ president Professor Peter Gibson . " We 're at the tip of a new paradigm for how diet can be used to treat asthma . " <p> And when someone uses the word " paradigm " you know they mean business . <p> Conducted by researchers from the University of Newcastle , the research is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost half of them do n't properly control the disease and they 're the ones who could benefit most from gut bacteria treatment . <p> The asthmatic participants in the study received daily supplements of inulin , a type of fibre found naturally in foods like onion , garlic , and banana . Your body does n't digest inulin ; rather , it acts as food for the " good " micro-creatures in your gut . <p> The altered their gut microbiomes , which in turn had a positive effect on asthma control and reduced airway inflammation . The researchers determined that the treatment worked best for those whose asthma was poorly controlled at the start of the study . <p> This is good news for asthma sufferers who are overweight or obese , who reportedly find it increasingly difficult to control their symptoms via pharmacological treatments for asthma such as puffers . <p> " This ground-breaking research offers hope of a viable , complementary treatment for tens of millions of asthmatics around the world struggling to control their asthma with existing medications , " said the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition to eating more fibre , asthmatics could benefit from improving their diets overall : other research presented at the TSANZ meeting found that one meal high in saturated " bad " fat can increase inflammation , tightening the already narrow airways that lead to the lungs and worsening asthma symptoms . <p> " More and more we are learning about how our Westernised , highly processed diet is negatively impacting our health , " said Professor Wood . " It illustrates just how vitally important it is that Australians eat a healthily and how fundamental healthy gut bacteria are to our wellbeing . " 
 <p> Pollen swept up into the November 21 storm became swollen by rain droplets and burst open , unleashing allergens tiny enough to be breathed deep into people 's lungs and triggering thousands of severe asthma attacks . <p> Scarily , many of those who were seriously affected had n't had any troubles with asthma before , meaning they had no medications at hand or idea how to treat the condition . <p> Research presented at the annual meeting of the Thoracic Society for Australia and New Zealand ( TSANZ ) warns that " a potentially hidden and significant population " are a risk of thunderstorm asthma . <p> " This is a wake-up call for all of Australia , " said TSANZ president Professor Peter Gibson in a statement . " Many more people than previously thought are at risk of sudden , unforeseen asthma attacks . " <p> The study surveyed 500 Melbourne healthcare workers who endured the storm , finding that more than a third of respondents experienced asthma symptoms such as shortness of breath , cough , chest tightness and wheezing despite having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who were hit by thunderstorm asthma were far more likely to have been previously affected by airborne allergens like rye , grass or mould so if you get hay fever , you could be at risk of storm asthma . <p> " The key message from our work is that anyone with hay fever should ensure that they have ready access to quick-acting asthma treatments such as bronchodilators at all times , but particularly in pollen season or if thunderstorms are predicted , " said lead researcher Dr Daniel . <p> " Severe thunderstorm asthma symptoms can strike rapidly and without warning . " <p> The research also determined that staying indoors during bad weather is no protection against thunderstorm asthma . <p> According to Asthma Australia , not all thunderstorms trigger thunderstorm asthma , but the condition is most likely to hit during late spring or early summer and in south-east Australia . If you 're concerned , see your GP . <p> Sam Rodgers , a Sydney man who grapples with thunderstorm asthma , told Coach that " the combination of low pressure , humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's about to strike . 
 <h> 10 foods to eat before 10am for a nutritious start to the day <p> FYI , you do n't have to eat all these foods before 10am ( unless you want to challenge yourself ) . But choosing one of them , or a few of them , or combining several of them into a single breakfast is a great way to start the day with nutritious , energising food .

 <h> Marathon running can take a heavy toll on your kidneys <p> At the end of a marathon staged in Connecticut in 2015 , scientists analysed blood and urine samples taken a small number of runners which determined 82 percent of them showed acute kidney injury . <p> The good news is that all the runners ' kidneys had fully recovered within two days . But the study , led by a team from Yale University and published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease , spotlights the heavier-than-expected toll that running a marathon takes on the kidneys . <p> " The kidney responds to the physical stress of marathon running as if it 's injured , in a way that 's similar to what happens in hospitalised patients when the kidney is affected by medical and surgical complications , " said Professor of Medicine Dr Chirag Parikh , who led the study , in a statement . <p> Acute kidney injury is a condition where the kidneys ca n't filter waste from the blood . The runners examined by Dr Parikh 's team showed stage 1 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body temperature , dehydration , or decreased blood flow to the kidneys that occur during a marathon . <p> That 's important because marathon running is growing more popular : according to , more than 24,000 Australians ( two-thirds of them men ) ran a marathon in 2016 , a number that is rising every year . <p> More research is needed to determine the effected of repeated marathons -- whether the cumulative effect on runners ' kidneys would grow worse over the long term , or whether their bodies would adapt to the strain . <p> " We need to investigate this further , " Dr Parikh stated . " Research has shown there are also changes in heart function associated with marathon running . Our study adds to the story even the kidney responds to marathon-related stress . " 
 <h> Lunchtime habits that could kill your energy by mid-afternoon <p> It 's normal to feel sleepy mid-afternoon a drop in energy levels is hardwired into your circadian rhythms . But what you eat for lunch can either heighten or slower the severity of that slump . Refined carbs , things like white pasta , white bread and white rice , are prime culprits : they 'll give you an energy spike that will disappear as quickly , leaving you slumping at your desk . Opt for wholegrain alternatives , and avoid rich toppings or additions that will also slow you down . 
 <h> A Hollywood body takes time <p> Hemsworth does n't just walk on set on the first day of shooting with magically gigantic biceps and rippling abs . Zocchi explained that the actor 's training regimen starts rolling about three months before the cameras do . <p> " That 's when we do our hard work , " he said . " When we 're shooting it 's just about maintaining it . " <p> Unfortunately , that does n't mean it would only take the rest of us three months to achieve Hemsworth 's 10/10 body he never gets any lower than an 8/10 , even when he 's not training ( to judge by his Instagram posts ) , so it 's a lot easier for him to get back to 10 than for someone who 's starting from a lower rank . <p> Getting a body like Thor does n't mean spending every waking minute pumping iron , either . While Hemsworth does sometimes cram into two training sessions a day , Zocchi explained that no individual session ever lasts longer than an hour . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hemsworth and make sure to go through legs day even though Thor 's most admired body parts are all above his waist . <p> " When we did a fitting for Thor 3 we saw the costume and it has no sleeves , " Zocchi revealed . " And Chris said ' All we 're doing is arms and shoulders now , that 's all I want . ' " <h> Even Norse gods eat chocolate <p> Hemsworth eats a lot of food to maintain his godlike frame at least 3500 calories a day . To put that in perspective , the average person only needs about 2000 calories ( The Rock claims he eats 6000 calories a day , and the giantlike powerlifter who plays the Mountain on Game of Thrones claims he eats 10,000 . ) <p> To get those 3500 calories , Hemsworth eats six meals a day of " clean proteins and veg " , where clean proteins are probably things like chicken breast , salmon , quinoa , almonds , eggs what you probably think of when you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hemsworth smashing pizza and burgers is his " biggest nightmare " , he revealed the actor does still have his indulgences : " He does still have a little bit of chocolate here and there .

 <h> Loneliness makes battling a cold even more miserable <p> How to prevent a bad cold : get plenty of rest , drink plenty of water , cultivate a rich social circle . <p> Psychologists from Rice University in Texas have determined that loneliness makes suffering through a cold an even more miserable experience . <p> The finding , published in the American Psychological Association 's journal Health Psychology , came about after an amusingly mean experiment . <p> More than 150 healthy volunteers , over half of them men , underwent psychological tests to assess their loneliness and the strength of their social networks . Then ( this is the mean bit ) they were force-fed a tonic to give them colds and then quarantined in hotel rooms for about five days to see who actually got sick . <p> Feeling lonely did n't make the participants any more likely to come down with a cold but the lonelier participants who fell ill reported more intense symptoms . <p> The researchers highlighted that loneliness is n't the same as simply being alone or having few relationships , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on whether they got sick . <p> " We looked at the quality of people 's relationships , not the quantity , " said study co-author Angie LeRoy , a graduate student in psychology at Rice University , in a statement . <p> " You can be in a crowded room and feel lonely . That perception is what seems to be important when it comes to cold symptoms . " <p> The finding is depressing but not surprising : the health costs of loneliness and poor social connections are well documented . <p> " Previous research has shown that different psychosocial factors like feeling rejected or feeling left out or not having strong social bonds with other people do make people feel worse physically , mentally and emotionally , " LeRoy said . <p> She suggested prevention might be better than cure : strengthen your bonds with your family and friends when you 're well , so you can fall back on them when you 're sick . <p> " If you build those networks consistently working on them and your relationships when you do fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . 
 <h> Why you should stop always saying ' yes ' and start saying ' no ' <p> But there are loads of other reasons you 're constantly sapped of energy , and they are n't always the things you expect . One prime example : you 've simply bitten off more than you can chew , because you 're bad at saying no to things . <p> " There are so many people , and I think particularly women fall into this trap , who are ' yes ' junkies , " says Dr Libby Weaver , author of the new book The Energy Guide . <p> Saying yes when someone asks you for something is obviously not a bad thing . The trouble arises when you 're a yes junkie who says yes to everything -- regardless of whether or not you 're actually capable of doing it -- and then later regretting over-committing yourself . <p> Weaver believes yes junkies can restore their energy by refocusing and learning to " flex their ' no ' muscles more frequently " -- which she concedes can be difficult . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's needs before your own , you 'll find that saying no is harder than you think , " she tells Coach . <p> The key to success , she explains , is learning to see the benefits of saying no to the person asking you for help for example , if you agree to meet a friend for dinner at the end of a long workday you 'll be too tired to be good company ( so maybe you should meet for brunch on Saturday instead ) . <p> " Yes junkies will never say no unless they can see that the other people will benefit from them saying it , " she says . " That requires an attitude shift . " <h> The power of scheduling <p> Saying no is one way to reclaim your energy . Weaver believes another equally important way is scheduling your time a strategy she 's personally benefitted from . <p> Though she initially resisted the idea of scheduling in all her tasks for fear her life would lose any sense of spontaneity , Weaver says she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather than having this insane to-do list that is never all done , you just ... put it into your diary to address it , " Weaver says . <p> The feedback she 's heard from people who 've become schedulers is that they stop worrying when they 're going to do a task , because they 've locked in the precise time to do it . <p> " When they 're relaxing or playing with children or reading a book , instead of their brains going , ' Oh my goodness , I still have n't done this or that , I should be taking care of it ' , they think , ' It 's in my diary , it 's handled . ' " <p> If the idea of become a frightens you , Weaver advises starting out by only scheduling three days a week and leaving the rest to be spontaneous . <p> " That way you feel that you 've got time or freedom , " she says . " But when people schedule , they actually end up with more time , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver is published by Pan Macmillan , RRP $39.99. 
 <h> Why men should eat after exercise and women should eat before <p> The age-old question : is it better to eat before or after you exercise ? The answer depends on whether you 're a man or a woman . <p> Research has determined that if fat burning is your goal , then men fare better if they work out on an empty stomach , while women do better if they 've had a snack . <p> Recent evidence of the phenomenon came from an experiment done for the TV show Trust Me I 'm a Doctor , which recruited 13 men and 17 women ( who were fairly inactive ) for a spin class , a Zumba class and a high-intensity session each week . <p> They were each given a drink before and after class that either contained carbohydrates or a calorie-free placebo . <p> While all of the women had burned fat by the end of the experiment , those who drank the carbohydrate drink prior to working out actually burned more . <p> When it came to the men , those who consumed carbohydrates after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that working out in the morning can be a good idea for men , when it 's usually been a while since they last ate . <p> " If they want to teach their body to burn fat , they 've actually got to encourage that by manipulating when they eat and how they eat prior to exercise , " he says . <p> " It teaches men 's muscles how to be better fat burners . It also trains your liver , which is the big processing unit within your body that helps support your metabolism and is involved in regulating blood glucose . " <p> Regardless of sex , some people say they prefer working out on an empty stomach while others say they need some fuel to get going , and Professor Stannard says it 's often got to do with how you ate the night before a session . <p> " It depends on when you go to bed and what you 've had for dinner the night before , " he says . <p> " You also get used to what you do . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be really hard at the start and you might feel a bit weak and have declining blood sugar levels . But if you do that on a regular basis , it 's just like exercise training and your body will get used to it . " 
 <p> The study 's 10 subjects , all healthy men aged between 20 and 27 or 55 and 65 , were invited to a laboratory where investigators messed with their sleep patterns for three weeks . <p> Every day , the men went to sleep four hours later than the previous day , essentially putting them on a 28-hour cycle . Their diets ( the overall calories and nutrients they took in every day ) remained unchanged . <p> This " circadian disruption " , which mimicked the effects of jet lag or shift work , resulted in the men getting a little over five-and-a-half hours sleep every 24 hours -- well short of the recommended seven to nine hours . <p> At the end of the three weeks , their blood samples were compared to those taken at the start of the study . <p> In addition to the decline in the marker for bone formation , levels of a marker of bone breakdown remained unchanged . That indicated old bone could be being broken down without new bone being formed . <p> " This altered bone balance creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone fractures , " said lead investigator Dr Christine Swanson , an assistant professor at the University of Colorado , in a statement . <p> Swanson added that the study could be a clue to resolving a medical mystery : why approximately half the cases of osteoporosis or low bone mass in the US have no apparent cause . <p> Interestingly , the bones of the younger men in the study looked to be harder hit by poor sleep than the older men 's . <p> " These data suggest that sleep disruption may be most detrimental to bone metabolism earlier in life , when bone growth and accrual are crucial for long-term skeletal health , " Swanson said . <p> Further studies will investigate whether the effect is similar for women . 
 <p> Sugar is delicious . It 's also not very good for us in excess amounts and nor are the low-calorie , artificial sweeteners we 're replacing it with . ( Sorry , Diet Coke addicts . ) <p> That 's the suggestion from a preliminary study presented at the US Endocrine Society 's annual meeting this week , which indicates artificial sweeteners upset your metabolism and encourage your body to store extra fat . <p> So if you 're opting for a no-sugar alternative to control your weight , it could end up backfiring . <p> " Many health-conscious individuals like to consume low-calorie sweeteners as an alternative to sugar , " said Dr Sabyasachi Sen , an associate professor of medicine and endocrinology at George Washington University and the study 's principal investigator , in a statement . <p> " However , there is increasing scientific evidence that these sweeteners promote metabolic dysfunction . " <p> Metabolic dysfunction basically means that the workings of your cells change to make more fat particularly if you 're already overweight or obese which Sen and his team observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they determined that sucralose , a common artificial sweetener , appears to increase the expression of genes that are markers of fat production and inflammation , and increase the accumulation of fat droplets , in stem cells taken from human fat tissue . <p> A separate experiment analysed samples of abdominal fat taken from four healthy weight people and four obese people who regularly consumed artificial sweeteners ( mostly sucralose but also aspartame and potassium acesulfame ) , and recorded " evidence of increased glucose ( sugar ) transport into cells and overexpression of known fat-producing genes " . <p> Artificial sweeteners are hundreds of times sweeter than normal sugar , which appears to alter how our bodies respond to the sweet stuff . Sen 's team found that subjects who consumed low-calorie sweeteners showed an overexpression of sweet taste receptors in their abdominal fat . <p> That could play a role in how easily glucose enters cells which is particularly concerning for people with diabetes or prediabetes , who already have higher-than-normal levels of blood sugar . <p> Sen emphasised that more work is needed to confirm his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . <p> " However , from our study , we believe that low-calorie sweeteners promote additional fat formation by allowing more glucose to enter the cells , and promotes inflammation , which may be more detrimental in obese individuals , " he said . <p> Whether or not to switch from sugar to artificial sweeteners is a complicated question . While the latter do indeed have less calories , that does n't mean they 're better for you . <p> According to the experts , it pretty much comes down to the same old advice : everything in moderation . <p> " Be mindful that the foods and drinks that have artificial sweeteners should n't replace more nutrient-dense choices in your eating plan , " dietitian Maria Packard , who is a spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia , told Coach in March . <p> " So if you are going to have chocolate , even sugar-free chocolate is a discretionary food it 's not contributing important nutrients to your food intake that are important . It 's still a treat food . " 
 <h> I 'm fit , so why does running up a set of stairs destroy me ? <p> You 're a regular exerciser who can run or cycle steadily for 40 minutes or even an hour . So why does sprinting up the stairs to catch a train leave you awkwardly puffing , red-faced and glistening in sweat in front of your fellow commuters ? <p> It 's probably because you 're an endurance exerciser but not as fit anaerobically , as exercise physiologist Carly Ryan from Exercise and Sports Science Australia explains . <p> " When you apply a stimulus to the body like a training load the body has to respond , " Ryan tells Coach . " By applying the stimulus regularly , the body learns to adapt to the stimulus , and respond more effectively . <p> " So your body will be more conditioned to the type of training you regularly perform . If you then try a different type of activity , your body will not be completely conditioned to that stimulus . " <p> Endurance exercise and short bursts of intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan says a good foundation of cardiorespiratory fitness does make anaerobic activity -- short and intense bursts of activity , such as sprinting for the train a little easier . <p> " There is some transferability of fitness . If you are a runner , and then perform another type of activity that requires the cardiorespiratory system , such as cycling , that fitness will be helpful , " says Ryan . <p> " The mechanics of cycling are different , so it will often feel a little more difficult than running to begin , but your body will adapt more quickly as the foundational fitness is there . " <p> If you 're a long-distance trainer but want to avoid feeling like you 're about to die when you have to run for the bus , the solution is to vary your workouts . <p> " This could be as simple as adding some interval training into your routine , " Ryan advises . " Aim for a routine that includes some cardio , strength and flexibility training . " <p> But if you 'd rather drink a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high intensity interval training , like F45 ) class , that 's okay . <p> " If you prefer a particular type of activity , do n't stress ! " Ryan says . " Any type of exercise will give you great health benefits , and it 's so important to choose activities you enjoy as this will keep you motivated to stick to your routine . " 
 <h> Why postbiotics might be the future of gut health <p> As we all obsess over kombucha and kefir in an attempt to stock our gut with good bacteria , science is a few steps ahead , looking into a potential new frontier in gut health postbiotics . <p> In case you missed the memo , gut health is having a serious moment , thanks mostly to the discovery of the gut-brain axis , which posits that our gut bacteria can play a significant role over our mental health . <p> For most of us , that 's meant eating foods that contain probiotics , which are " good " bacteria , as well as prebiotics , which are the fibres that feed said gut bacteria . <p> But fast forward to the future and probiotics might be ancient history as we look to postbiotics for premium gut health . <p> Scientists are realising that it might not be the probiotics themselves that help our gut , but rather the molecules and chemicals that they secrete the postbiotics that are actually of benefit to us . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neuroscience Lab , says that while probiotics can be great for our gut health , it 's almost impossible to know which strains individuals need . <p> It 's meant that plenty of people have fallen victim to slick marketing campaigns promising that a particular probiotic product could hold the key to curing health woes , when the research is n't really there . <p> " If we could isolate that individual chemical , we could pop that into a pill and that chemical might be a more efficient and easier way to deliver the benefit of the bacteria , " Dr Bertrand told Coach . <p> " It might be a drug or it might be something akin to a vitamin or it might be something else acting in the gut . It might be something those bacteria are doing to other bacteria in the gut . " <p> The challenge for gut scientists is that technology does n't currently exist to allow them to culture all of the gut bacteria , so there are thousands of strains that we know nothing about . <p> " The idea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria are doing and how they connect with the rest of the body , then we can either help it or hinder it , " Dr Bertrand says . <p> On top of that , Dr Bertrand says that scientists are increasingly understanding that our gut microbiome also consists of parasites , yeast , ancient single-celled organisms called archeae , and bacteriophages , which are viruses that prey on bacteria . <p> " They all have a lot to say about which bacteria are thriving or not because the viruses in particular prey on the bacteria , " he explains . <p> " It 's a whole new area of research , wondering whether the bacteriophages are in control of the bacteria . " <p> At present , the only way to knowingly consume postbiotics is by taking vitamin supplements that happen to be the same compounds our gut bacteria can produce -- but it 's going to be a pretty haphazard approach with no guarantee of a positive health outcome . <p> " Bacteria make vitamins B and K , and you can take those off the shelf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about postbiotics , Dr Bertrand says the best thing you can do for your gut is have a varied , high-fibre diet by eating a wide variety of grains , fruit and vegetables . <p> " Assuming you have a good mix of gut bacteria to start with , prebiotics will make them happy , " he explains . <p> " If you are eating varied fruits and vegetables and getting lots of different sorts of fibres , this is going to increase all the bacteria and give you more different types of bacteria , which has been shown to be beneficial . " <p> In essence , Dr Bertrand says that if you do n't have irritable bowel issues , you want to eat the opposite of a low-FODMAP diet . <p> " If you 're talking about feeding your microbiota , then a healthy diet has to include fibres and sugars you ca n't digest , " he says . <p> " If you are eating refined food , the bacteria will be starving and get quite cross as they start to die . You 'll get sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mood quite depressed . " 
 <h> Seasonal affective disorder : How winter can give you the blues <p> Seasonal affective disorder ( appropriately shortened to SAD ) is a condition supported by 30 years of research that shows some people will experience depression during winter due to being exposed to less sunlight . <p> So a recent US study from Auburn University in Montgomery , Alabama ruffled some lab coats in the academic community when it claimed SAD is basically not a thing . <p> The research assessed data collected from an annual phone survey of around 235,000 Americans and found people who took the survey during winter did not report higher instances of depression . <p> Steven Lobello , one of the study 's authors , believes a lot of research into SAD has been flawed , as he explained to Coach . <p> " There 's a widespread perception that winter is linked to depression , so when you ask people ' Do you get depressed in winter ? ' they 're inclined to agree . Or if you ask if they get depressed in a particular season , they 're more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way the data we analysed was collected , people were n't asked about seasons at all . In research where people have been asked a leading question you find SAD , and when you take that leading question out you 're less likely to find it . " <p> The study findings are plausible , especially in this internet age when googling any symptom pretty much leads to a self-diagnosis of some horrible illness . <p> " If the symptoms are affecting your ability to function at work , in your relationships , to keep up your everyday activities or enjoy your interests , if you 're feeling hopeless , having thoughts of death or suicide , you need to seek an evaluation from a qualified mental health professional , " Rohan advises . <p> Thankfully , there are treatments that have proven to be extremely effective in treating SAD . <p> Light therapy works by positioning yourself near a box that emits artificial light which is received by receptors in the eyes , triggering a serotonin release , encouraging natural sleep cycles and a general feeling of wellbeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box from 20 to 60 minutes a day seek medical advice before using it . <p> In her own research Rohan has found CBT , where a sufferer works with a psychologist to change negative thought patterns , to be the most effective treatment for SAD long-term , with patients experiencing fewer relapses after undergoing CBT . <p> " Light therapy and anti-depressants are palliative treatments they only suppress the symptoms and have to be continued over time . " <p> But Australians have less reason to be concerned about SAD than in North America , where a lot of the research into the condition is being done . Professor Michael Baigent , a clinical academic psychiatrist from Flinders University in Adelaide , says SAD occurs mainly in countries at higher latitudes , such as parts of North America , Canada , Northern Europe and Scandinavia . <p> " Australia has high levels of bright light , so even on the cloudiest day in winter , you only need 20-30 minutes of daylight exposure to prevent SAD , if you were predisposed to get this condition , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on their way to work or hanging out the washing . It is possible for SAD to occur amongst night shift workers or someone in a confined space like a nursing home or hospital , but it is generally not something that we see clinically very often . " <p> Still , if you experience depression in winter or your depression worsens during the cold months , see you doctor and ask about treatments available . 
 <h> How to strengthen your bond with your dog : understand how they perceive the world <p> " Is my dog really feeling happy when he looks happy and guilty when he looks guilty ? Can he really read my thoughts as accurately as he seems to ? Does he really think he 's a dog , or does he think he 's people ? " <p> All dog owners have gazed at their best friend and idly pondered these Very Important Canine Questions . Dr Alexandra Horowitz has made a career out of studying them : she 's a professor of cognitive science who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College in New York City . <p> Horowitz says it 's no accident that humans and dogs get along so well : Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris have lived alongside each other for millennia , evolving a unique and powerful bond . <p> " The result is an animal with whom we can have a dynamic , two-way friendship , " Horowitz tells Coach . " Dogs seek us out , are reliably delighted to see us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-human does . " <p> That 's not just the sort of " dog person " babble that cat people roll their eyes at . Studies that have measured a dog 's hormonal response to humans prove they have an attachment to their owners akin to what babies have with their parents . <p> " Understanding the perspective of the dog allows us to figure out what they actually can understand and what they experience , rather than making assumptions that are n't grounded in fact . I think that 's what all owners want . " <p> If you want to understand how your dog really sees the world , start by thinking about how they smell it . <p> Horowitz explored this in her most recent book , Being A Dog : Following the Dog Into a World of Smell . A dog 's sense of smell is vastly more powerful than a human 's ( we have about 6 million scent receptors ; they have 300 million ) , and it 's their dominant sense . <p> While the human world is generally driven by colours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a dog 's world is primarily " smelly " . <p> " They are smelling the world first . Just that on its own is enough to turn our default perception of what a dog 's world might be like upside down , " she says . " Where we come out of sleep and open our eyes , seeing the world in front of us , dogs come out of sleep nose first , seeing the smells of the day . " <p> In that light or rather , in that smell putting ourselves inside dogs ' minds is n't as straightforward as it seems . Not only do their senses work differently , so do their brains . Which means just because Rover looks guilty because he chewed up your favourite cushion does n't mean he 's experiencing guilt the way a human would . <p> " Three-quarters of owners think that dogs feel guilt because they have a guilty look , " Horowitz says . But she 's studied this , and her research has determined that if you treat a dog like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " regardless of whether not it committed a sin . <p> " The guilty look is a response to the owners , not to their misdeed , " she says . <p> Your dog is also pretty great at reading your mind ( she seems to know it 's time for walkies and gets worked up , or that you 've had a bad day and comes over for a cuddle ) , but maybe not in the way you think . <p> " I think dogs are amazing observers of our behaviour which is why they so easily pick up when we are getting ready to pack to go on a trip , or when we might be angling to take them for a walk , " Horowitz says . <p> " They certainly can notice differences in our behaviour and potentially hormones caused by big emotional changes though it is not at all clear that dogs are thinking to themselves , ' Oh , she seems sad ' . They just notice the tears and come to investigate . " <p> And to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " know " they 're dogs , or do they think they 're people ? Again , this is asking a human question of a non-human species . <p> " I do n't think they 're thinking about it , " Horowitz believes . " But I do think they consider the human family their family . In that sense , we are all the same species . " 
 <h> How many teaspoons of sugar are in Australia 's favourite biscuits , from least to most <p> A fraction of a teaspoon of sugar per biscuit but a serving size is 13 biscuits , totalling 6.3g sugar ( a teaspoon and a half of sugar ) . <p> A teaspoon of sugar equals 4g the World Health Organisation recommends an upper limit of roughly six teaspoons ( 25g ) of added sugars per day . A biscuit as a treat here and there wo n't put you over that total , but if you get stuck into an entire packet ... 
 <h> Carbs on trial <p> Just like Lindsay Lohan , carbs have a bad reputation they just ca n't seem to shake off . <p> It 's all thanks to the controversial diet started by Dr Robert Atkins in the 1970s that recommended reducing carbs and increasing fat and protein , and became popular when celebrities like Jennifer Aniston attributed their ripped bodies to Atkins . <p> However , in recent years most health experts have come out in defence of carbs , arguing they 're an essential part of a balanced diet and actually aid weight loss . But the idea that carbohydrates are the devil of dieting has become so ingrained that bread often still gets a bad wrap ( ha ha ) . <h> The case for carbs <p> Carbohydrates provide our muscles with the energy they need to burn fat , so unless you 're living an extremely sedentary lifestyle as in , bed-bound -- carbs should make up 45-65 percent of your total energy intake roughly 230-310 grams per day . <p> " The issue for many is eating too much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , not the carbs themselves , " Burrell explains . <p> " A thick slice of Turkish bread is packed full of refined carbs and is unlikely to support weight control , but two small slices of brown bread such as Helga 's has fewer carbs than 10 rice crackers . " <p> Burrell says half a cup to a cup per meal of natural , unprocessed carbs will provide the energy you need to get through the day without feeling lethargic , not to mention work harder during exercise , meaning you 'll burn more calories . <p> It 's better to have the bulk of your carbs at the time of day you 're most active , which for most people is morning and afternoon . <p> Highly active people should eat more carbohydrates , and those with a sedentary lifestyle should keep consumption to the lower end of the recommended daily intake . <p> Carbs also provide the satiety most of us need to stick to a healthy diet . Unless you have super-human levels of willpower , or can afford to pay someone to tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might be how Jennifer Aniston manages it ) feeling deprived will probably lead to a binge , where you 'll likely consume more calories than if you just had some brown bread or brown rice at lunch . <p> " A low-carb diet is very challenging for the average person to follow , " says Burrell . " And in the long-term , low carb diets can reduce metabolic rate , meaning your cells become less efficient at burning calories . " <h> The case against carbs <p> Cutting down on or completely avoiding refined carbs -- white bread , pastries , biscuits , pizza is crucial for weight loss and overall health , but aside from that there 's not much of a case for low-carb diets anymore . <p> While every now and then a study will claim that cutting down on carbs can lead to fast weight loss , increasingly research shows this is because any reduction in calories will do that , regardless of what dietary elements are removed or reduced . <p> This was the case in a study of 811 overweight adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-carb and low-fat and found all the diets resulted in similar amounts of weight loss regardless of the macronutrients emphasised . <p> This was supported in research led by Kevin Hall , a metabolism researcher at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the US , whose study was praised for reducing variables by monitoring participants in a lab for two , two-week intervals . <p> In one fortnight carbs were reduced , the other fats , and the results showed slightly more weight loss when fat was cut out -- although the differences were minimal . <p> Generally , the only instance where Burrell recommends cutting out or significantly reducing carbs is at night , which can be an effective weight loss strategy , although she says this may be appropriate for some people but not others . <h> The verdict <p> As long as you eat an amount of whole carbs -- half a cup to a cup per meal of starchy vegetables , legumes , brown bread , brown rice -- appropriate for your daily activity levels , and avoid or cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weight loss goals . <p> As Burrell suggests , you can opt to reduce carbs at night or on days you 're less active . But every person 's lifestyle varies , so she recommends getting professional help for a weight loss strategy to suit your specific needs . <p> " A dietician can help to develop a diet plan tailored to a person 's individual activity levels , food preferences and lifestyle , " Burrell says . 
 <h> Why drinking alcohol after exercise can be good for you <p> A beer or glass of wine after hitting the gym might seem like a waste of the calories you just worked so hard to burn , but combining exercise and alcohol is a growing trend in Australia and overseas . <p> Bier Yoga yes , that 's doing yoga poses while holding and sipping a bottle of beer was a hit when classes were held in Sydney this year , and New York City gym Uplift Studios offers a " happy hour " class , where members get to enjoy a complimentary glass of wine after a Friday night workout . <p> In good news for those partial to a brew or a vino , it 's actually not so bad to imbibe after a sweat session provided it 's in moderation . <p> Dr J. Leigh Leasure from the University of Houston in the US , the lead author of a study into the the relationship between physical activity and alcohol consumption , told Coach that booze and working out trigger a similar response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol and exercise independently activate reward circuitry , so engaging in one could in fact trigger a desire for the other , " she says . <p> It makes sense that rewarding yourself with your drink of choice after a run would make you feel motivated to put on your trainers again the next day . But there are other factors at play . <p> A 2012 study by the University of Pittsburgh showed that " moderate amounts of alcohol consumed in a social setting can enhance positive emotions and social bonding " . So clinking glasses with your gym buddies after smashing out a class will strengthen your ties with an active community , something the founders of Bier Yoga can attest to . <p> Berlin-based instructors Emily and Jhula have held their ( admittedly unorthodox ) classes around the world , and say bringing beer into the sometimes intimidating or puritan world of yoga helped participants feel more comfortable and relaxed , and also introduced new people to a healthy lifestyle practice they might not have tried otherwise . <p> " We get a lot of guys coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , and they leave with a big smile and a changed perception of what yoga could be , " Emily told Coach . <p> The other factor in favour of a post-gym bevvy is the big B -- balance . A moderate amount of alcohol after a workout is much better than an all-or-nothing approach ; abstaining during the week only to consume extreme amounts on the weekend . <p> " Binge drinking is bad for the brain and people should do whatever they can to avoid it , " warns Leasure . <p> You do n't need science to tell you that the excessive amount of calories consumed in a binge-drinking session , the greasy food you 'll wolf down the next day , and the fact you 'll cancel your gym class thanks to a pounding headache and messed-up stomach is definitely not good for your health . Cheers to everything in moderation . 
 <h> Study confirms everything you already love about avocados <p> Validation at last if you 're that person who adds avocado to toast , sandwiches and salads because it 's so good for you : a new health review has confirmed they are indeed the best . <p> A trio of Iranian researchers pored over multiple studies into avocados ' health benefits and determined they 're one of the best foods to combat metabolic syndrome . <p> Metabolic syndrome is the umbrella term for a cluster of disorders that signify general unhealthiness , and it 's estimated a third of Australians have it . <p> It 's characterised by having at least three of these : fat around the abdomen ; high blood pressure ; raised blood triglycerides ( a common type of fat ) ; low levels of HDL ( good ) cholesterol ; and elevated blood glucose ( sugar ) levels . <p> The only way to treat metabolic syndrome is by upping your physical activity and improving your diet which , judging by this new research , means more avo . <p> " Avocado is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fatty acids , " wrote the authors of the review , published in the journal Phytotherapy Research . <p> Translation : Avocados are jam-packed with things that will protect you from disease . <p> The authors added : " The lipid-lowering , antihypertensive , antidiabetic , anti-obesity , antithrombotic , antiatherosclerotic , and cardioprotective effects of avocado have been demonstrated in several studies . " <p> Translation : We know avocados are great at lowering blood pressure and triglycerides , reducing the likelihood of diabetes and weight gain , preventing blood clots and plaque from building up in your arteries , and improving your heart health . <p> While it 's the smash-able flesh of the avocado that most of us enjoy , the review demonstrated that the entire fruit has health benefits : the leaves of avo plant , avo skin , avo oil , and even the avo stone . 
 <h> The best weight loss advice for men <p> If you 're an Australian man and have never followed a diet or exercise regimen , you 're not alone . Research has shown blokes are more difficult to engage in a weight loss program than women , and are less likely to have attempted one . <p> This might sound like dire news since men face just as many health issues as their female counterparts . However , the reason for the findings could be that women are targeted by more weight loss products and marketing than men . <p> " Men are less likely to be seduced by quick-fix weight loss programs , and may worry less about their appearance in general , " says Susie Burrell , the dietitian behind personalised online weight loss plan Shape Me . <p> " But often when men do decide to commit to a healthy lifestyle or weight loss program , they have more success than women as they keep their emotions out of it and just get on with the job . " <p> There 's more good news for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 's training regularly he does n't need to be as restrictive when it comes to diet . <p> There are several practical steps men can take when embarking on a healthy eating and exercise plan to see the best possible results in the shortest amount of time . Unfortunately , it does involve calling in the fun police for the first month or so at least . <p> " Men tend to socialise a lot over fatty food and alcohol which can mean they need some time off hanging out with the boys to get the results they want , at least initially , " Burrell says . <p> " Men should definitely limit how much alcohol they drink too , as Australian males have a significant alcohol intake , " she adds . <p> Indeed , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics , Australian men were more than twice as likely to exceed safe alcohol consumption guidelines than women . And you might be surprised at how many calories are in your drink of choice . <p> Of course , most catch-ups with friends do happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to hide out at home for a month or more , there are better menu choices you can make when eating out . Burrell says it 's vital to increase your daily intake of fresh foods and vegetables to help you feel full . At the pub , order a big side of steamed vegetables instead of fries , and ask to get your dressing on the side . <p> You should also watch portion sizes , especially at night . For meat that means one- two serves a day about the size of the palm of your hand . For bread , it 's two small pieces once or twice a day . Breakfast cereal should be three-quarters of a cup once a day . <p> Burrell suggests a plate ratio of one quarter protein , one quarter carbs and half vegetables or salad , and using measuring cups and kitchen scales to know how much you 're really eating . 
 <h> Health benefits of chocolate ( to give you an extra excuse to eat some ) <p> It 's Easter that time of year we all pretend chocolate is a health food as we doze off in a delicious sugar haze . But while chocolate is a firm " sometimes food " , that does n't mean it does n't have some benefits we can all use to justify an Easter pig-out . One of them is an improvement to your good cholesterol : A 2004 study found that eating 75g of dark chocolate a day ( that 's a pretty hefty amount a standard block of Lindt chocolate is 100g ) boosts HDL cholesterol levels , because cocoa powder contains a type of antioxidant called polyphenols. 
 <h> How the average Aussie measures up to a professional AFL player <p> It 's pretty easy to heap criticism on the lifestyles on professional footy players after all , they only have to turn up to training and games to succeed right ? Compared to the average Joe blow , they should have waaay more time in their lives ... <p> As I found out , in a ground-breaking experiment with HCF and the Sydney Swans , living the life of a professional athlete involves way more than simply " showing up " . <p> The premise of the experiment was brutally simple : over the course of a week I would wear an activity tracker 24/7 that counted every step I took , every calorie I burned and every wink of sleep I missed out on . <p> But it does n't end there : I was also asked to chronicle every last morsel that crossed my lips by taking a picture of every single meal and then sending that on to the club 's accredited practising dietitian . <p> ( Yes , that includes the beers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant emails at three in the morning , Elise . ) <p> Each of my results would then be compared to those of an elite AFL player inside the Sydney Swans , and I know what you 're thinking there 's no way an average Aussie could match up -- but you 'd be surprised . <h> But first : A little about me <p> Every good experiment needs a baseline to start with , and I 'm proud to say mine was n't too far off the mark for a " generally " healthy adult . Being a health reporter , it would be rather critical of me to be telling people day-in and day-out to exercise when I 'm spending my time noshing down on Maccas fries . <p> I 'm a 26-year-old male , 175cm tall , and on a good day I weigh around 75kg . That puts my BMI at 24.5 , which just on the cusp of the normal weight range . <p> While medically healthy , compared to an AFL player I am very short and a little bit too fat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the reasons why I 'm not a professional athlete the social media posts alone would have me sacked within a week . ) <p> ( The most flattering image of the author that he could find . ) <h> Exercise <p> And so onto the particulars : over the course of the week I averaged around 13,000 steps a day , which was just 11 percent less than the AFL players . <p> ( It 's suggested that average Aussies aim for 10,000 steps a day , but it 's a rather arbitrary number that does n't really factor in dedicated exercise sessions or energy consumption . ) <p> The maximum time spent exercising in any one day was three hours and 36 minutes . That sounds like an absurd amount of time , although in practice I went to the gym for an hour and then did the groceries and walked home ( a true test of a man , no doubt ) . <p> Compared to the players , that was a whopping two hours less time spent exercising every day . Yep , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day that 's a full-time job . <h> Resting heart rate <p> It 's typical for most of us to assume that the fitter you are , the longer and harder you 'll be able to exercise . While this is strictly true , a person 's real fitness is measured in how fast they recover from a hard session and much of that comes down to your resting heart rate . <p> My average resting heart rate hovered around 55 bpm ( beats per minute ) , which is quite good but not as low as the players who have been measured in the low 30s . <p> If you 're keen to try this out for yourself , make sure you take your measurements very first thing in the morning . Place two fingers on the underside of your wrist , and count how many beats occur in 20 seconds . Simply multiply that by three and you have your resting heart rate . <h> Diet <p> Here 's where things start to get ugly . According to the club 's dietitian Elise Cameron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was " alarming " . <p> Further to that , Cameron also believed that I was n't eating enough . " Dietary data does not reflect a diet that would be sufficient for someone who exercises as much as Stu , " she wrote in her notes . <p> " To maximise benefits of his exercise , Stu should consume less caffeine , more fruit and vegetables and reduce saturated fat intake . " <p> She was also particularly alarmed that I consumed far more calories on the weekend ( I got real deep into a " treat yo'self " phase ) than on weekdays . <p> Compared to the players my diet was , in a word : horrific . I consumed half the amount of carbohydrates as the players did , double the dairy , 30 percent less vegetables than the players and a lower amount of calories overall . <p> Somewhat shockingly , my caffeine intake was an astonishing six times higher than the players even on game days where they deliberately " caffeine load " for energy before the first bounce . <h> Sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where the average Joe falls down compared to an AFL player is how much time in the sack we get . <p> My total sleep time came in at a very poor six hours a night , which was 20 percent less than the players , who each aim to get a solid eight hours a night . <p> On average , I woke up one or two times a night to pee , which the Swans exercise scientists did n't really seem to have a problem with . ( If only they knew the fridge raids that were involved . ) <h> Results <p> Surprise , surprise : a young , coffee-drinking journalist is not as healthy as a professional athlete . <p> Despite that ground-breaking finding , there was two really particular things I took out of the experiment , and neither come from a personal basis . <p> First , is that being a professional athlete would have to be one of the most time-consuming jobs on the planet . Sure training , game time and media commitments take up some time , but constantly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The second is that it 's okay not to be perfect . Despite eating no fruit at all , getting barely a wink of sleep every night and drinking eight coffees every day , I can still reasonably say that I 'm on the right side of the healthy/unhealthy swing . <p> Sure , nobody 's expecting me to look or perform like an AFL player , but every step closer you can take towards your hero athletes is doing you a world of good . <p> To celebrate its fourth year of partnership with the Sydney Swans , health fund HCF has created a content series launching this April to start a conversation about health at all levels and ultimately create a healthier future for all Australians .

 <h> The dark side of identifying as an introvert <p> It 's hard to resist indulging in 10 minutes of narcissism when those personality quizzes pop up in your Facebook feed . <p> Depending on which test you take or what mood you 're in that day , you might be an introvert , an extrovert , an introverted-extrovert , or even an ambivert which is when you are both , apparently . <p> As accurate as your results might feel ( " yes , I do feel tired after socialising in a group ! " ) according to experts it 's an oversimplified and unhelpful way to understand ourselves . <p> Obviously if you 're doing a BuzzFeed quiz , you know it 's not scientifically sound . But even if you 've taken the official-seeming Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) , which is popular in some workplaces , it does n't mean much . <p> The MBTI test divides people along four categories or " dichotomies " -- introversion vs extroversion ; sensing vs intuition ; thinking vs feeling ; and judging vs perceiving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychological communities have all but discounted Myers-Briggs as fundamentally flawed , mainly because of how extreme it is , as Rachel Annunziato , an associate professor of psychology at Fordham University in New York explains . <p> " A health professional should steer clear of using tools that have n't been scientifically validated and that do n't have a feedback component beyond the blanket statements given to everyone who scores the same way , " Annunziato tells Coach . <p> " The four dichotomies the MBTI points to really do n't correspond to the main dimensions of personality as have been discovered over the last 50 years or so . " <p> says that while you might show introverted or extroverted tendencies , it 's not helpful to categorise you into being one type or the other . <p> An individual 's personality is on a spectrum , and is dependent on a number of constantly changing variables , and a very rare number of us would fall strictly into a category of " introvert " or " extrovert " . <p> " There 's a danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warns . " Extreme or polarising beliefs about oneself are exactly the sorts of thoughts we would try to unearth and challenge in treatment . " <p> Thinking of ourselves in this way could also lead to serious mental health problems being overlooked . <p> If a person thinks of themselves an introvert , for example , and confuses feelings of anxiety or depression as merely being part of that and does n't seek help , those issues could go untreated and continue to worsen . <p> It 's not all bad , though . If taking an introvert/extrovert test encourages you to spend time self-reflecting , that 's a good thing . And if you feel better about curling up with a book on Saturday night because it 's a universally recognised " introvert thing " , that 's a positive outcome too -- just remember it 's best to take it all with a grain of salt . 
 <h> Stop being so busy : Why having no downtime is bad for you <p> Talking about how busy we are has become a go-to topic of conversation . " How have you been ? " " Oh , I 'm sooooo busy . It 's just mental . What about you ? " " Yep , really busy at the moment . Sleep when you 're dead , right ? " <p> A recent study into the cultural phenomenon found it 's because being time-poor has essentially become a status symbol . <p> There 's a widespread perception that " busy individuals possess desirable characteristics , leading them to be viewed as scarce and in demand . " The belief has even had a flow-on effect to brands , with products or businesses that claim to save us time ( like food delivery services ) being perceived as having just as high a status as some luxury brands . <p> But this trend of bragging about how busy we are is n't good for us . While you might think packing your days back-to-back is a sure sign you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high gear constantly can have a damaging effect on mental health . <p> " As a consequence of this constant need to be busy , our brains suffer an unfortunate beating , " says Dr. A.J. Marsden , an assistant professor of psychology and human services at Beacon College in Florida . <p> Dr Marsden says recent research has shown multi-tasking exhausts the brain , making us bad at creativity and problem solving . She points to the benefits of the mindfulness movement such as reduced stress and anxiety , and improved diet . <p> " Take your time with each task and be mindful of what you are doing . You will actually save time , make less mistakes , and feel happier about your work , " she says . <p> Talking about how busy you are all the time can also lead to social isolation . It may signal to others that they should n't bother you because they 'll only feel like a burden on your already hectic schedule . <p> " When you tell someone you 're busy , you 're telling them they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . If it happens repeatedly , they may start to feel rejected . <p> " Instead of saying you are busy , give a specific reason for why you have to turn down their invitation and let them know a time when you are available . " <p> According to Dr Marsden , being constantly flat-out can be a symptom of deeper psychological issues . It 's worth taking some time to stop and reflect on whether you might be avoiding something uncomfortable or difficult , like admitting you 're no longer happy in your career , or are having doubts about your relationship . <p> " We might feel anxious , nervous , or depressed about things in our lives , but we avoid allowing ourselves to feel these emotions by distracting ourselves with busyness , " explains Dr Marsden . <p> " Most of us dislike feeling negative emotions or thinking about our insecurities , so we do this keep busy to avoid thinking about our own weaknesses and unhappiness . " <p> If you do n't believe your mouse-on-a-wheel lifestyle is a sign of anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could just be terrible at scheduling and prioritising . <p> If you are tired of the busy trap , it 's worth looking at your calendar and assessing how you 're spending your time . <p> " Be realistic about your schedule , " Dr Marsden says . " Try to get a good understanding of how long something will take you and plan your schedule accordingly . " <p> It might sound obvious , but allowing more time than you actually need to get somewhere instantly takes the pace down a few notches . Instead of panicking that you 're going to be late when there 's a queue at the train station ticket machine , you can enjoy the time to catch up on a podcast or scroll Instagram . Arriving at a meeting early gives you time to organise your thoughts and focus on being present . <p> As society seems to value leisure time less and being productive more , do n't forget to make time for relaxing , reflecting and allowing your mind to wander . If you need to , schedule it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
 <h> How many teaspoons of sugar are in Australia 's favourite chocolates , from least to most <p> A teaspoon of sugar equals 4g -- the World Health Organisation recommends an upper limit of roughly six teaspoons ( 25g ) of added sugars per day , which includes sugar from chocolate bars . Many of them put you over that total in one hit . That does n't mean you should never eat chocolate bars -- just that they 're a firm " sometimes food " . <p> FYI : Nutrition information panels on chocolate bars often split them up into two or more servings per packet . But in the real world , you 're more likely to eat the whole packet to yourself , in a single sitting , and the figures in this slideshow reflect that . 
 <h> More than half the alcohol Australians drink is consumed at ' risky ' levels ( oops ) <p> Officially we 're advised to drink no more than two standards drinks a day , and no more than four in a single session . But if you 've enjoyed a big night recently it 's likely you exceeded those limits -- and you 're not alone . <p> The research found that while only 28 percent of Australians exceed the limit , that group accounts for 84 percent of the total alcohol consumed . ( Two-thirds of alcohol consumed is by people who drink four or more standard drinks a day , a level deemed high risk . ) <p> Data for the analysis was collected via phone surveys that probed respondents on what , where and how much they drank . <p> In terms of sheer volume , regular-strength beer , bottled wine and spirits are the types of alcohol most likely to be consumed beyond the limit -- unsurprising , given the popularity and ubiquitousness of those drinks . <p> In relative terms , liqueurs and cask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riskiest quantities -- more than three-quarters of their consumption exceeded the limit . <p> When you think of risky drinking , you probably picture no-good youths hitting the town to get wasted . While that 's not a totally unreasonable assumption ( especially if you 're guilty of doing 1am tequila shots at a bar recently ) ( oops ) , the study determined that unhealthy drinking patterns span all age groups and locations . <p> " Most of the alcohol consumed outside of the long-term risk guidelines is consumed outside of licensed premises , and the proportion of all alcohol being consumed in a high-risk fashion is highest in drinkers aged 35 -- 54 years , " the research wrote . <p> The study added that the majority of Australians do drink " in a responsible manner " , but that the results suggest that all types of drinking patterns need to be considered when alcohol policy is discussed . <p> Despite those " red wine is good for you ! " -type we all enjoy reading , there 's no " safe " level of alcohol consumption as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alcohol guidelines state that " for healthy men and women , drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day reduces the lifetime risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury " , where those diseases include liver disease , a range of cancers , hypertension and heart disease . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Do n't ever be scared to ask for help .

 <h> Can an IMAX screen make a spin class less punishing ? <p> You might have guessed by the use of the word " punishing " in the headline of this article that a spin class is not my favourite type of exercise . <p> Stuck on the bike , thighs burning , face dripping with sweat , the instructor urging the class to pedal faster ( faster ! ) feels like some kind of low-level torture to me , and as a result I ca n't help watching the clock , willing the seconds to tick by so I can get the hell out of there . <p> So I was intrigued by IMAXShift , a new kind of spin class being offered in New York . In a room the size of a small movie theatre , tiered rows of bikes face an IMAX screen that displays different immersive visuals , like scenic landscapes or music videos . Could focusing my attention on the screen make me actually enjoy a spin class ? <p> " Enjoy " is probably the wrong word to describe those breathless , jelly-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin classes I 've done before . <p> Once the lights went down and the sound system was thumping , it was easy to lose myself in the virtual experiences on the enormous screen . We pedalled through outer space , flew over lush green fields , lakes and trees with autumn leaves turning brown below , and raced along a trippy rollercoaster ( which is what I imagine being on acid must be like ) . <p> We also worked out to music videos which included , surely by no coincidence , female dancers with enviably slender , toned legs wearing tiny short-shorts ( #fitspo ) . <p> The scenes on the screen gave me something to focus on , and were more engaging than staring at a wall , the sweaty back of the person in front , or the clock . Given the cardiovascular , toning and fat-burning benefits of high-intensity cycling , I can see myself returning to IMAXShift -- which is something I never thought I 'd say after a spin class . As it turns out , it was probably boredom that turned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a useful technique , " says sports psychologist Kris Dun from the Australian Institute of Sport . " It allows the exerciser to focus on something other than pain and/or fatigue of the exercise , and so allows them to continue training . It can also help prevent boredom in long training sessions . " <p> Another benefit of working out in front of a giant screen , or anything that 's stimulating to look at is the fun factor , which is key for a consistent exercise regime . <p> " If someone enjoys the exercise they are more likely to return , " Dun says . " In choosing to exercise it 's a good idea to do something that you like . It makes it that little bit easier to commit to the session and to do the work . " <p> If you ca n't get to New York to try IMAXShift in Brooklyn , you can still apply the distraction technique during your next exercise session .

 <h> Vinotherapy : Why it 's not just a waste of good wine <p> Despite how it sounds , vinotherapy is n't just cracking open a bottle of wine after a stressful day . <p> It 's a therapeutic treatment that began in France ( where else ? ) that involves grape skin and seed extract being applied to the skin , supposedly having an anti-aging effect due to the powerful antioxidants in the grapes . <p> Since its beginnings in French vineyards , vinotherapy has spread around the world , with athletes bathing in it to soothe sore muscles , and spas and wellness centres offering treatments using products infused with grape seed and skin . <p> The vinotherapy trend looks set to gain new traction after the opening of The Spa at the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown , tucked away from the busy Manhattan streets . The menu offers the Chardonnay Ritual , which involves being scrubbed and soaked in grapeseed extract , before a masseuse 's expert hands massage it in . <p> Recently , I headed to The Spa at the Four Seasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz is about . <p> The treatment started off as I expected , with a body scrub infused with chardonnay grape extract applied to my body to exfoliate the skin . After rinsing off the residue , my skin was the softest it 's been probably since I was a toddler , but the masseuse laughed when I mentioned this . " Just you wait ! " <p> Next , a grape seed infused mixture was slathered over my skin , before I was cocooned in a foil-like wrap and towels to let the ingredients soak in . I could n't decide if I felt more like a mummy in a tomb or a burrito , but my wandering mind promptly checked out as the masseuse worked some kind of head massage voodoo on my scalp . I 'm pretty sure I fell asleep . <p> After another rinse came the massage , again with a grape seed-infused mixture , just to make sure all that good stuff really gets in there . Afterwards , my skin felt softer than Beyonce 's looks , and definitely did look smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . I was so calm and relaxed after a couple of hours zoning as the masseuse worked her magic that I stepped onto the street afterwards in a daze , feeling like I 'd been away for a long weekend , not just a couple of hours . <p> After my visit I spoke to Dr Richard Semba from the John Hopkins School of Medicine in the US , who has conducted studies into the benefits of reservatrol , the ingredient found in red wine , for humans . <p> Dr Semba said while there 's a known benefit to drinking one or two glasses of red wine a day , there 's no scientifically proven benefit to applying wine grape extract to the skin . <p> " It is better to drink your Chateau Margaux than to splash around in it with a rubber ducky , " he quipped . <p> But given the way people remarked on my ridiculously soft skin for days after the vinotherapy treatment , and the stress-reducing powers of massage and spending time in a spa in general -- it was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from my iPhone and email inbox -- the benefits of vinotherapy are clear to me . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> For all the ladies in the place with style and grace - our Runaway Excel Tank and Persia print !

 <h> The tubs of yoghurt with more sugar than a bowl of ice-cream <p> Yoghurt is a nutritious and healthy snack , but it depends on the type of yoghurt -- and the worst offenders are equivalent to downing 7.5 teaspoons of sugar per serve , according to a new analysis of popular Aussie brands . <p> Research from the health campaign LiveLighter has determined that more than half of yoghurts sold in Coles and Woolworths have more than three teaspoons of sugar ( about 12g ) per 100g . <p> Many of the other most sugary yoghurts are flavoured with fruit like passionfruit , mango and fig . However , fruit yoghurts are n't all sugar bombs -- several of the least sugary yoghurts included the likes of strawberry and coconut . <p> It 's important to note that sugar is n't necessarily bad -- even the healthiest possible yoghurt will still contain some sugar in the form of lactose , which occurs naturally in dairy foods . The problem is added sugar which is often heaped into processed foods . <p> " Unfortunately in Australia , food manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their products , which makes it really difficult for shoppers looking for a yoghurt with no or little added sugar , " McAleese said . <p> " As a general rule of thumb for fruit-flavoured yoghurts , check that the total sugar content is under 12g per 100g -- 6g of that is likely to be lactose , while up to 6g may be fruit . Anything more is likely to be added sugar . " <p> Heart Foundation Victoria CEO Kellie-Ann Jolly recommended that buyers should favour reduced-fat Greek , natural or plain yoghurts , which have less sugar than the flavoured varieties . <p> McAleese said yoghurt buyers are being hoodwinked by food labels and advertising that promote sugar-laden yoghurts as low in fat , diet , natural and high in probiotics -- which does n't give a clear picture of their nutrition profile . <p> " It can be really confusing for shoppers to know which ones are genuinely good and which are desserts in disguise , " she said . <p> ( Food labels are notoriously misleading .

 <p> And in a cruel irony , sleep deprived people often worry about not getting enough Zzzs , which can make it even harder to doze off . It 's a vicious , exhausting cycle . <p> Enter Inscape , a " meditation and relaxation " centre in New York that offers a Deep Rest class , which teaches a method for relaxing the body and calming the mind in order to help people to fall asleep faster , and sleep more deeply once they do . <p> I recently booked in for an evening Deep Rest class at Inscape 's Manhattan space , a haven of peace and quiet in the middle of the incessant horn honking and generally frenzied energy of the city . <p> But inside , the madness quickly melted away ; there are comfy couches to sit on , candles flickering , and the locker room and bathroom are a " silent area " , to help guests bring that wired city-living pace down a few notches . <p> In a nutshell , the session is like the end of a yoga class when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except it goes for 45 minutes . <p> In the room where the Deep Rest class takes place , called The Alcove , it 's all soft blue lighting , trippy decoration thanks to a kind of crocheted web hanging from the ceiling and audio of low , soothing sounds . <p> Mats set up with pillows , leg rests and blankets are arranged on the ground , and after leaving shoes and belongings outside , guests are instructed to choose one and lie down before a facilitator enters and takes a seat in the corner . <p> The facilitator stays for the session to make sure everyone 's comfortable and to gently wake anyone who falls asleep and starts snoring , but the class is guided by the recorded voice of a woman with a soothing Australian accent , which feels like a warm hug as it fills the room . <p> First , the voice instructs the class to tense and release different muscles : tense the toes , tense the foot , tense the ankle , tense the shin , release the toes , release the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat . <p> With the body relaxed , the session moved to " inner " work : focusing the mind on a body part and then moving the attention to another , as guided by the soft voice , all the way from the forehead to the toes . Then there was a breathing exercise : breathing in four seconds , pausing , exhaling for four seconds , then doing the same but for five seconds , and so on . This is effective at calming the nervous system . <p> As for what happened in the rest of the session , I 'm not completely sure . My eyelids began to feel heavy , and brief snatches of dreams flashed in my mind . I willed myself not to fall asleep and become one of those snorers that need a tap on the shoulder . <p> When the session was over , we were encouraged to sit up and spend a few minutes sitting quietly in order to take the tranquillity we 'd just experienced into our lives . <p> Back on the busy streets , I felt peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " jerk " taxi driver , who slammed his horn loudly in reply , I thought if everyone took sessions at Inscape the city would be a friendlier , less stressful place . <p> Most nights I have to force myself to stop what I 'm doing and go to bed , and before I know it it 's midnight and I have to be up in six hours . But after the Deep Rest session , I felt slightly drowsy and could n't wait to eat , shower and go to sleep . It erased that wired feeling we often bring home from a day the office , or from scrolling Twitter , Instagram or Facebook . <p> I turned the light out at 10pm on the dot , and I know I slept deeper than I normally do , because when my alarm went off in the morning , it took me a while to hear it and realise it was n't just a phone ringing in my dream . <p> If you ca n't get to New York , Inscape also have an app that offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one similar to the Deep Rest class . <p> You can also apply the practice of gradually relaxing the mind and body before bed . Find a dimly lit , quiet space , lay down flat on your back , and work your way through your body , either by tensing and releasing each muscle , moving your attention slowly from one part to the next , or inhaling and exhaling for an even number of seconds . <p> An Australian woman with a calming voice to guide you is nice , but not essential . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> When life gets tough , put on your and get MOVING !

 <h> Vending machine snacks are even unhealthier than you think <p> If you 're buying something from a vending machine , you 're probably choosing something more " convenient and delicious " than " healthy and nutritious " . That 's not a surprise -- but what is surprising is laying out just how unhealthy vending machine treats can be . <p> For a study published in the journal Nutrition and Dietetics , a University of Sydney team analysed the offerings in 61 campus vending machines and classified 95 percent of the available snacks as unhealthy -- an even higher proportion than the researchers expected . <p> " We allowed foods that are ' junk foods ' to be classified in the healthy , as long they were served as a healthy portion size , " lead researcher and dietitian Amanda Grech told Coach . " However , even with this allowance for small portions of junk foods , still very few of the foods met this criteria . " <p> The ratio of snacks sold was also surprisingly high : over a nine-month period the vending machines deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1570 healthy snacks . <p> The typical vending machine snack averaged 1800 kilojoules ( more than 400 calories ) -- about three times the recommended amount for a snack . Grech said chips were the most commonly sold item , with chocolate a close second . <p> But just because you 're not buying either of those does n't mean you 're getting something healthy , because many of the seemingly nutritious options were calories bombs that could end up padding your waistline . <p> " For example , a dried apricot muesli slice may seem like a healthy choice , but it provided as much energy as a main meal and it is n't nutritionally balanced , " Grech said . <p> " As it very energy-dense , it is unlikely that that it will be as filling as a main meal either , leading people to accidentally eat more than they need . " <p> For beverages , only 49 percent of vending machine sales were classified as unhealthy -- bottled water was the most commonly sold drink . However , Grech cautioned that there were still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team were driven to conduct the research because young adults are gaining weight faster than any other age group , and a starting point for reversing that trend is to determine what healthy and unhealthy foods are on offer in universities . <p> The vending machines out in the wider world offer and sell a similarly vast array of unhealthy foods . Grech said there 's an obvious solution to the vending machine problem : provide healthier options in them . <p> " There seems to be a common perception that people wo n't choose healthier items from vending machines , " she said . " But research has shown that if healthy items are available and not too expensive , then people will buy them . " <p> But just because the solution is simple does n't mean it 's easy : according to Grech it 's hard to source healthy items to stock in vending machines , so health professionals need to work with suppliers to offer more healthy options . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> When life gets tough , put on your and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need when it comes to comfort and support - shop this maximum support number via the Instashop today ! #thisisactiveliving #movenourishbelieve #activeliving 
 <h> How getting the right mattress saved my relationship and made me a better employee <p> As a child , I would toss and turn so much that my mum was forced to fasten the linens to my bed in a bid to stop me from waking , shivering in the middle of the night . My sleepwalking ( and talking ) was so bad I was regularly found in far-flung corners of the house ( or , on rare occasions , outside it ) , babbling happily to myself at all hours . <p> As a teen , I lay awake until well after midnight , listening to CDs or texting friends on my oh-so-cool Nokia 3315 , adamant I just was n't tired enough for sleep -- and then being barely able to drag myself from under the covers in time for school the next morning . As a result , I spent the vast majority of my last two years of high school in a cycle of unproductive exhaustion and guilt-ridden sleeplessness . <p> So adding another person to the mix as an adult has been ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey conducted at the Edinburgh Science Festival showed couples who slept less than an inch apart were most content in their relationships . <p> On the contrary , for the best part of our first year living together , my boyfriend and I shared a queen-size bed , and we 've all-but driven each other insane . He 's over six-foot tall and likes to spread out , while I ( allegedly ) move constantly , regularly stealing the covers in the process . <p> As a result , I 'd taken to regularly switching off my 4:55am alarm , favouring precious sleep over a pre-work gym session , while his schedule meant he got into the habit of taking a mid-afternoon nap in a bid to catch up on what was lost the night before . We were both suffering at work , and barely had the energy to enjoy the company of the other when we were at home together . <p> But the good news is most of those nasty side-effects can be reduced -- and even improved beyond what they were before by bettering our sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something had to give ( and spurred on by a particularly convincing ad in which a man dives onto a mattress on which a glass of red wine was balanced without spilling a drop ) , we immediately accepted when I was given the chance to try a king-size Koala mattress -- an Australian-made product that 's cool to touch and , more importantly , minimises partner disturbance . <p> From the first night , we were sleeping eight-hours solid -- even though we 'd made two trips to Ikea in a single weekend , managing to forget a part to our new bed base on both occasions . We were both more productive and more engaged at work , we were going on dates together , we even developed hobbies ! <p> So while you may not be able to change the fact you 're a night owl or that your favourite series runs well beyond your bedtime , improving the quality of your sleep when you eventually get to bed is a reasonably small investment to make in your short- and long-term health prospects . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days I 'm more readily forgiven . 
 <h> When self-control backfires : Wanting to resist that second slice of cake could make you more likely to eat it <p> Without self-control , we 'd all have eaten ourselves into an early grave by now -- death by constant piles of junk food crammed into our mouths . ( Which does n't sound like a bad way to go , tbh . ) <p> The fact that you have n't succumbed to an epic junk food binge yet is proof you have some degree of self-control -- but it 's likely you wish you had more . <p> Yet that desire could , ironically , mean you end up with less self-control than you started with , according to a psychology study by Israeli researchers published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin . <p> " Although it 's good for society that both children and adults have a high level of self-control , the mere desire for self-control could be an obstacle to achieving it , " said Dr Liad Uziel , a psychologist from Bar-Ilan University , in a statement . <p> He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tested their self-control , and found that those who reported a strong desire for self-control found it more difficult to summon up self-control during difficult tasks . <p> Intriguingly , even seemingly iron-willed participants with inherently high levels of self-control found it more challenging to use it , if they desired more self-control . <p> The researchers speculate that the desire for more self-control somehow translates as a sense that you do n't have enough self-control -- thereby crushing your spirit and causing you to cave in to whatever it is you 're trying to resist . <p> " The common practice of driving people to desire more self-control runs the risk of actually undermining their confidence and increasing their doubts that they have the resources to exhibit self-control , " said Uziel . <p> " Forget about the word ' willpower ' because otherwise you end up losing confidence and feeling bad -- a self-fulfilling prophecy ends up happening , " health psychologist Dr Marny Lishman told Coach last year . <p> One of the strategies Lishman suggested was developing different habits to avoid putting yourself in situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-stepping the conundrum altogether . 
 <h> If you find it tough to stick to a diet , blame what goes on deep in your brain <p> On Monday , you 're vowing to eat healthy this week because you want to lose a bit of body fat . By Tuesday , you 're eating a whole takeaway pizza to yourself because you 're starving . <p> Dieting is such a challenge because of the complicated processes hunger sparks in your body -- which are even more complicated than we realised , according to a new study that 's identified a new appetite-regulating mechanism in the human body . <p> It 's long been known that the hormones ghrelin and leptin play a significant role in your appetite -- the former induces hunger , and the latter signals that you 're full . But there appears to be more it than that . <p> Researchers from Hiroshima University in Japan have now identified how a particular molecule in your brain -- a protein dubbed NPGL -- increases when you 're skipping meals and decreases when you , say , finish that entire pizza . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds grew larger regardless of what they ate . He 's since found the molecule in all vertebrate animals , including humans . <p> Experiments on mice suggest NPGL has a powerful impact on how much you eat : those fed a low-calorie diet for 24 hours saw an " extreme " increase in their levels of the molecule , while those who ate a high-fat diet for five-weeks decreased theirs . <p> said more research is needed to confirm exactly how NPGL triggers hunger and the role it plays in weight gain and weight loss . ( There are a host of other neurons in your brain that also affect appetite , so it 's not just NPGL that 's to blame for eating a whole pizza to yourself . ) <p> The good news is that , if you 're struggling to stick to a diet , you should n't beat yourself up about it too much -- your body is an incredibly complicated machine , and you 're really just a slave to its whims . <h> Previous <p> Oh my . This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw snow was in Texas ? I told Tobi I 'd love to visit Utah one day .

 <h> How to beat insecurity <p> Most people , with the possible exceptions of Mariah Carey and Kanye West , could probably confess to experiencing self-doubt or a lack of confidence every now and then . But sometimes insecurity can take over to the point that it becomes debilitating . It might present itself as social anxiety or low self-esteem , and can stop you from excelling at work , making friends , dating or having a healthy relationship . <p> So where does this insidious feeling come from , and how can we overcome it ? <p> " Insecurity is largely learned , whether it be by a lack of positive reinforcement when we 're young , or experiencing major moments of failure , " says Rachel Annunziato , an associate professor of psychology at Fordham University in New York . <p> says difficult childhood or high-school years can set up negative thought patterns that continue into adulthood -- although insecurity might also strike later in life after a brutal , like a tough break-up , failed business or getting fired from a job . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a chicken-or-the-egg situation , according to Annunziato . <p> " Insecurity can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety , although it can flow the other way as well , " she says . " Someone who develops depression or anxiety may start to feel insecure . " <p> As for what is a normal amount of insecurity to experience , it comes down to what extent the thoughts and feelings interfere with a person 's ability to live a normal , overall happy life . <p> " If insecurity is constant enough to cause distress and also influence outcomes in one 's life , it should be addressed , " Annunziato advises . <p> Overcoming insecure thoughts largely comes down to retraining the inner voice we use to talk to ourselves . <p> " A person who feels insecure in their work environment might say to themselves ' if I take on that big project , I know I 'll fail ' " , gives as an example . " Instead , it might be helpful to carefully weigh the evidence for why you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same situation . " <p> Only a truly terrible person would tell their friend they 're going to fail at taking on a new project at work , so we definitely should n't speak to ourselves that way , either . <p> The idea that being outside your comfort zone is " where the magic happens " , at least according to inspirational Instagram accounts , can help a person to overcome insecure thoughts , too . <p> It 's like facing a fear or flexing a muscle -- the more you do it , the stronger you get . <p> " It can be difficult , but exposing yourself to avoided or fear-provoking situations is an effective way to practice putting yourself out there , " Annunziato says . <p> It might be helpful to make a daily or weekly list of goals when it comes to the part of your life that insecurity most often rears its ugly head . If your confidence levels go through the floor in social situations , aim to initiate a conversation with someone you do n't know well three times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hit it off straight away on a date , try to see it as a practice opportunity so you 'll be on your confidence and conversation A-game when you meet someone you do click with . <p> If you 're insecure about your appearance , make a daily habit of telling yourself in the mirror that you 're beautiful -- it sounds cheesy , but eventually you 'll start to believe it . <p> says it 's important not to beat yourself up about being insecure , and that feeling this way can be helpful in some circumstances . <p> " Just like anxiety , some level of insecurity may not always be a bad thing , especially if it comes across as humility and fosters better preparedness or goal-directed behavior , " she says . <p> In other words , you might be driven to work harder at something because you have fear or concern you might fail . <p> A psychologist will be able to help you explore your insecure feelings and develop strategies for overcoming them , especially if there are long-standing factors like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek professional help . 
 <h> F45 Challenge : How an everyday woman lost 10kg in eight weeks <p> Victorian woman Alex Bennett dropped 10kg in eight weeks -- an impressive 20 percent of her body fat . Her weight-loss " secret " was old-fashioned diet and exercise , with a twist : she got extra help from participating in the F45 Challenge . <p> Running several times a year , the eight-week challenges provide detailed meal plans and nutrition info , advice on what supplements to take and how to stay motivated , and ( of course ) daily workouts at F45 Training clubs around the world . <p> Bennett , a member at F45 Torquay in Victoria since December , says she 's now deep in the F45 " cult " , with a particular passion for cardio classes . But she says she did n't consider herself especially fit or health-focused before she started her challenge earlier this year . <p> So it was a huge surprise when she was so successful she was named the challenge 's global winner . <p> Speaking to Coach as she embarked on the next F45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett revealed her winning strategies . <h> Stop focusing on weight loss <p> I 'd tried to lose weight before but never really stuck to it . Every other time I was focused on " I want to lose weight , I want to lose this much weight " . It was always more about the weight -- not about getting healthy and fit . <p> But I was sick of not eating healthy and not feeling healthy . This time I wanted to be healthy . I never thought " I just want to do the F45 Challenge to lose 10kg " -- it was about being healthy again . And the weight loss just followed from that , which is why I think I stuck to it . <p> A lot of people think they 'll do the eight weeks then have an awesome body , but it 's not it 's not just about that . You 've got to want to change your whole lifestyle and be healthier . <h> Prepare , prepare , prepare <p> Before the challenge started I just read up everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my supplements -- protein and magnesium and that sort of thing -- all organised before I started the challenge . That was good to have ready from the start . <p> It 's really motivating having it all set out for you . Being really organised made it easy for me . At first it seems like a lot of effort to put aside a couple of hours in the afternoon to prepare all your food -- but once it 's done , you 'll thank yourself for it . <h> Start by making small changes , then build on those <p> Before I started the challenge , I 'd read that past winners said they 'd trained six days a week . I had no idea how they 'd done that ! The first week I did the challenge I think I only went four times -- I could n't do anymore , I was too tired ! A lot of people thought I would 've gone every day . But it was n't like that . I worked my way up to it . But by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> I stopped having snacks late in the afternoon or the early evening . That was one of the little things that was hard . But instead I 'd just eat dinner earlier and go to bed earlier . And I also made sure to keep busy and have a good routine , because people eat when they 're bored . So I kept busy . <p> I was kind of overwhelmed at the start . It all seemed like so much . But I just listened to little tips people told me -- drink three cups of green tea a day , have lemon with hot water early in the day . Now I 've learned heaps and everyone always asks me about it . They say it 's so confusing but I tell them it 's quite interesting learning about it all , about what 's good and what 's not , and how to read food labels . <h> Sticking to a good diet is the most important part <p> The food was definitely the hardest part of the challenge . Everyone finds that hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just that I ate too much of the healthy stuff . Even too much of the right food is still too much . So that was a big reality check . <p> One of the hardest things was coming to terms with the portion sizes in the challenge 's meal plans . Some of them seemed so small ! The meals would be split into three serves and I would normally eat all three of them at once . <p> A lot of times I 'd get home from work and I 'd see my family eating food I wanted . And I 'd think " Nope , remove yourself from this situation , go do something else " . And then five minutes later I would n't even be thinking about it anymore and I 'd eat my own dinner . <p> I definitely tried to drink a lot of water , because thirst can be mistaken for hunger . So I 'd have a green tea and if I was still hungry I 'd have something healthy from the meal plan . I found there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy " and then I regretted it after because it did n't actually make me feel better . <p> A lot of people have asked me about sugar cravings . But I 've never really had that because I 'm not a sweet tooth person ! So that was one bonus . I 'm lucky . <h> Ignore the scales <p> I think people get obsessive with weighing themselves on the scales . You get disheartened because you might not be losing weight -- because you 're building muscle . So it does n't show on the scale . <p> I never weighed myself apart from when I had a body composition -- three scans over the course of the challenge . But I took photos every Sunday or every second Sunday , and compared them . They were a much better indication of my progress than my weight . It was so much better seeing photos , and comparing the first photos to final photos is crazy ! <h> Listen to your body <p> If you really are tired one day , do n't work out . Especially early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a lot less than you 're used to eating . In the first couple of weeks I only went four times a week . <p> If you really do need to eat something , make a healthy choice . You 'll feel much better . I could n't believe how much more awesome I felt from eating different foods . Your body thanks you for it . And since I finished the challenge I do n't want unhealthy food . Because I do n't feel like it , I know how amazing I feel from eating healthy . 
 <h> Beware of going gluten-free : it could be bad for your heart <p> Eating whole grains is good for your heart -- so not eating whole grains because you 've hopped on the gluten-free bandwagon could mean your heart is worse off in the long run , according to a team of US researchers . <p> Their study of more than 100,000 men and women , published in the British Medical Journal ? found that eating gluten does n't increase your heart disease risk . In fact , avoiding gluten could backfire because you might miss out on foods that benefit your heart . <p> " It may cause some harm to follow a low-gluten diet that is particularly low in whole grains because those grains appear to have a protective effect against heart disease , " said the study 's lead author Benjamin Lebwohl , from the Columbia University Medical Center , reported MedicalXpress . <p> It 's important to note the US study specifically looked at " asymptomatic people without coeliac disease " -- a genetic condition affecting about 1 in 70 Australians that basically means even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( For coeliacs , eating gluten is associated with a higher heart disease risk . ) <p> Lebwohl told MedicalXpress gluten is clearly harmful to coeliacs , but that his study pushes back against the popular notion that a gluten-free or low-gluten diet " is healthy for everyone " . <p> Gluten is the umbrella term for proteins found in grains like wheat , rye , spelt and barley and the products made from them . Despite the small number of people negatively impacted by gluten , up to 1 in 10 Australians ( mostly women ) are believed to restrict their intake of it -- often by buying up the gluten-free products that now burden supermarket shelves . <p> Aside from a possible impact on your heart health , cutting gluten can have other downsides : whole grains are a great source of fibre and some kinds of vitamins . 
 <p> Exercise is a great natural mood booster that can treat mental health issues -- and , if you 're a man , it could even improve the mental health of your unborn sons . <p> That 's the finding of new research out of Melbourne 's Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health , published in the journal Translational Psychiatry . <p> A Florey team made the finding by studying groups of mice : one group of fitness-loving mice was put onto a four-week regime on their exercise wheels , while a second group of ( to use the words of the institute 's media statement ) " Homer Simpson " mice laid around and , presumably , drank beer and ate doughnuts . <p> Both groups of mice were then mated with female mice who had n't done any running , and the couples ' offspring were put through a range of behavioural and anxiety tests . <p> " Our most striking finding was that the male offspring of running mice were better at suppressing bad memories as juveniles , and had lower anxiety levels as adults than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute 's Professor Anthony Hannan in a statement . <p> It 's an important finding in the field of epigenetics , which investigates how and where you live impacts the expression of your genes and the genes of your offspring . In the words of US doctor Francis Collins , " genetics loads the gun , and environment pulls the trigger . " <p> " Epigenetics is an emerging area of interest in biological research , " said Professor Hannan . " It is the bridge between ' nurture ' and ' nature ' , providing the signals that switch certain genes on or off in response to our environment " . 
 <p> Most Australian adults would know they 're meant to eat two or more serves of fruit and five or more serves of vegetables every day . Whether or not they get there is another question . <p> A recent national survey reported 45 percent of Australian women and 56 percent of Australian men did n't eat enough fruit . And 90 percent of women and 96 percent of men did n't eat enough vegetables . This figure is worse than for the preceding 10 years . <p> Men had on average 1.6 serves of fruit and 2.3 serves of vegetables per day , and women had 1.8 serves of fruit and 2.5 serves of vegetables . A serve of fresh fruit is a medium piece ( about 150 grams ) and a serve of vegetables is half a cup of cooked vegetables or about a cup of salad . <h> Why do we need so many veggies ? <p> A high intake of fruit and vegetables lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes , heart disease , stroke and some cancers . These chronic diseases are unfortunately common -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2008 if everyone in Australia met fruit and vegetable recommendations . <p> The recommendation to include plenty of vegetables and fruit in our diet is based on a large body of evidence showing the risk of a range of health conditions is reduced as we eat more fruit and vegetables . The specific targets of two serves for fruit and five to six serves for vegetables are largely based on nutrient requirements for healthy people and what diets usually look like for the average Australian . <p> So to set these guidelines , certain assumptions are made about dietary practices , such as breakfast being based around cereal/grain and dairy foods , and main meals being comprised of meat and vegetables , usually with a side of something starchy like rice , pasta or the humble potato -- an Australian staple . <p> Does this mean it 's the only pattern to meet all the nutrient requirements ? No . Could an adult be equally healthy if they ate three serves of fruit and four serves of vegetables ? Yes , probably . <p> Some recent research even suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates an optimal intake for reducing our risk of heart disease and early death to be around ten serves of fruit and vegetables a day . Whether we are aiming for two and five , or ten serves , is somewhat academic -- the clear message is most of us need to increase our fruit and vegetable intake . <h> Why is two and five such a hard ask ? <p> Diets higher in fat , sugar and grains are generally more affordable than the recommended healthy diets high in fruit and veg . In fact , for Australians on low incomes , a healthy food basket for a fortnight would cost 28 to 34% of their income , up to twice the national average for food expenditure . <p> As a result , people with limited access to food for financial reasons often choose foods with high energy content ( because they are filling ) over those with high nutritional value but low energy content like fruit and vegetables . These high-energy foods are also easy to over-consume and this may be a contributing factor to weight gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality but not lower in energy content , which contributes to a higher rate of obesity , particularly in women . <p> Fresh fruit and vegetables cost more to purchase on a dollars per kilojoule basis , and also perish more quickly than processed foods . They take more time and skill to prepare and , after all of that effort , if they do n't get eaten for reasons of personal preference , they go to waste . For many it may not stack up financially to fill the fridge with fruit and vegetables . Under these circumstances , pre-prepared or fast food , which the family is sure to eat without complaint or waste , is all too convenient . <h> How we can increase veggie intake <p> The home and school environments are two key influencers of children 's food preferences and intakes . Parents are the " food gatekeepers " and role models particularly for younger children . Where there is parental encouragement , role modelling and family rules , there is an increased fruit and vegetable intake . <p> Dietary behaviours and food choices often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So encouraging fruit and vegetable intake in schools by mechanisms such as " fruit snack times " may be a good investment . <p> Policy approaches include subsidies on healthy foods . Other examples include levying a tax on foods of low nutritional value , improved food labelling , and stricter controls on the marketing of unhealthy foods . In Australia debate continues around a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages , which could be used to subsidise healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables . <p> Research has found the more variety in fruit and vegetables available , the more we 'll consume . Those who meet the vegetable recommendation are more likely to report having at least three vegetable varieties at their evening meal . So increasing the number of different vegetables at the main meal is one simple strategy to increase intake . <p> This could be made a journey of discovery by adding one new vegetable to the household food supply each week .

 <h> Inside the infrared sauna that claims to deliver the same results as exercising <p> I was drenched in sweat , my heart was racing and I had that feeling . But I had n't been exercising -- I 'd just been sitting in a hot box for 45 minutes . <p> I 'd visited HigherDOSE , an infrared sauna centre in downtown New York regularly visited by celebrities ( a high-profile Australian model arrived for her session as I did ) . I 'd been drawn there by the promise of pretty much all the benefits of exercise -- weight loss , improved circulation and a mood boost -- without moving a muscle . <p> One 45-minute session is said to provide the same benefits as running about five kilometres ( infrared saunas claim it 's possible to burn up to 600 calories ) , a serotonin hit similar to spending time in the sun , and the relaxation of getting a massage or meditating . <p> I was skeptical , but after 45 minutes in one of HigherDOSE 's private sauna rooms ( you can plug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the experience more enjoyable ) I did feel pretty amazing . I could feel my circulation had improved , I felt energised , my muscles were relaxed and most of all , my skin was radiant . <p> But while I felt good , could it really have provided the same benefits as running for five kilometres ? <p> Not exactly , says Dr Richard Beeker from the University of British Columbia in Canada , who has researched the purported benefits of infrared saunas . <p> " There is a mild cardiovascular work load , but not as much as running , " Dr Beeker told Coach . He does n't believe a 45-minute session could burn 600 calories , as claimed by the 1980s study that many infrared sauna places cite as proof . <p> " That 's based on the amount of energy that is needed to evaporate the sweat from a sauna session -- however most of that energy comes directly from the heat of the sauna " . <p> " Infrared sauna use seems to upregulate NOS ( nitric oxide synthases ) which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He also confirmed the likelihood of a mood boost , although he says there 's been no solid scientific research into it . <p> " Saunas have been shown to increase QoL quality of life in neurological disorders , however , I am not aware of any studies that specifically measure brain serotonin pre-and post-sauna . " <p> Dr Beeker also said infrared saunas can make skin look healthier : " Improved circulation and sweating to ' clean out the pores ' could certainly improve the appearance of the skin ; of course that is subjective . " <p> Japanese research could confirm another possible benefit of infrared saunas : treating chronic fatigue syndrome . In the 2015 study , 10 patients sat in a 60 degrees Celsius infrared sauna for 15 minutes , once a day , five days a week for a month . <p> The subjects perceived fatigue levels , pain , and mood were evaluated before , during and after the sauna sessions , and on average the patient 's fatigue on a scale of 1-10 dropped from 6.7 to 4.8 .

 <h> How many teaspoons of sugar in breakfast cereals , from least to most <p> A teaspoon of sugar equals 4g -- the World Health Organisation recommends an upper limit of roughly six teaspoons ( 25g ) of added sugars per day , which includes sugar from chocolate bars . <p> Two things to keep in mind : First , your serving size of cereal is probably higher than the recommended serving size -- so you may be eating even more teaspoons of sugar than this . Second , there 's an extra 6g of sugar ( another teaspoon and a half ) in the milk you pour on cereal , in the form of lactose , and even more in the table sugar and honey you might ladle on top . 
 <h> Taking vitamin C probably does n't fix a cold -- but you still need it <p> Stocking up on vitamin C is something we 've been taught to do at the first sign of a cold , whether it 's in the form of fruit , orange juice or a supplement . But where did this belief that vitamin C can ease a cold come from , and does it really do anything ? <p> The widespread use of vitamin C as a common cold treatment started in the 1970s when American chemist and author Linus Pauling published several books on the subject as a result of extensive research , although his findings were contested by many in the scientific community . <p> Dr Harri Hemil ? assessed the findings of animal studies where varying levels of vitamin C were administered to different groups , and concluded that a dose daily could shorten the duration of a cold by 17 percent , and a dose of vitamin C on the first day of cold symptoms shortened its length by 19 percent . <p> Notably , the groups that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those that received half the amount , as did groups that took it only on the first day they were sick . <p> Dr Hemil ? argues in his paper that this is good reason for more research to be done into vitamin C as a common cold cure , looking especially at whether extra-large doses are beneficial , and at what stage they should be taken . <p> Alexander J Michels Ph.D from Oregon State University 's Linus Paling Institute ( co-founded by the father of vitamin C research ) , who looks at the role of micronutrients in aging and disease , says the research ? analysed needs further investigation . <p> " Unfortunately it is too early to say that large doses of vitamin C could lessen the duration of a cold , " Michels tells Coach . <p> " The problem is that we are dealing with a large amount of inconsistent trial designs . The data is very ' dirty ' , and it makes interpretation very difficult . " <p> Another review by Dr Hemil ? found that the incidence of colds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiers or soldiers in freezing conditions , was reduced by half when they were administered with vitamin C. <p> But Michels says for the average person , there 's no scientific evidence that consuming large quantities of it once you realise you 're sick with a cold will do any good . <p> " Timing of vitamin C during a cold is a big unknown because it 's hard to do that type of research . Most people start feeling i 'll long after they have been exposed to a virus , so it becomes difficult to say when a therapeutic window opens or shuts . " <p> Your best bet is to consume vitamin C regularly as part of a balanced diet to maintain a strong immune system , improving your chances of preventing sickness . <p> " Vitamin C helps to keep components of the immune system in good condition , primarily supporting the actions of white blood cells , " Michels explains . " It 's an excellent antioxidant and is very effective at reducing some types of inflammation , which probably contributes to these functions in immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels in the body at all times . " <p> So how much vitamin C should you aim to consume every day ? The Australian government recommends 45mg a day , but you can safely consume much more -- Michels says up to 400mg a day has proven beneficial . <p> And the good news is you do n't have to eat much to hit your daily intake . An orange has approximately 70mg , a cup of strawberries has 85mg , and one green capsicum is estimated to have 95mg of vitamin C goodness . <p> Supplements work too , but by getting your vitamin C from fruit and vegetables you 'll also be consuming fiber and other important nutrients and minerals along with it . <p> Michels agrees with Dr Hemila 's recommendation that the potential benefits of vitamin C are promising and should continue to be investigated . <p> " We should invest more into vitamin C research , especially on the common cold , so we can better understand the power and limitations of vitamin C supplements . <p> " It might do a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yet . " <p> We ca n't prove vitamin C helps a cold , but unless consumed in extreme quantities it 's not bad for you . So if you do come down with a cold , it wo n't hurt to eat some extra fruit and vegetables while you 're resting up . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> @ljclarkson with her number one - The Tarni Sports Bra ? ?

 <h> Hardly any of the salt in your diet comes out of the salt shaker <p> You 're probably dimly aware we 're all eating too much sodium , but the solution seems easy : just go easy on the salt shaker at dinnertime . Except the salt shaker accounts for hardly any of the salt in your diet . <p> A new study published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation found that restaurant food and processed food are the source of 70 percent of dietary sodium in three US regions . <p> Only about 5 percent of sodium is added at the table via the salt shaker . Nearly 6 percent is added during food preparation at home , while about 15 percent comes from salt found naturally in all foods and in tap water ( in Australia , there 's around 20mg of sodium per litre -- a tiny amount ) . <p> Australian adults ( whose diets are n't dissimilar from Americans ' ) are advised to eat less than 2300mg of sodium per day , equivalent to about a teaspoon of salt , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hypertension are advised to limit sodium to 1600mg per day . <p> " Telling patients to lay off the salt shaker is n't enough , " said the study 's lead researcher Lisa J. Harnack , a professor at the University of Minnesota , in a statement . <p> She and her team reached their finding by polling 450 people across California , Alabama and Minnesota about their eating habits over several days . ( Because the participants knew their sodium consumption was being measured , they might have changed how they ate during the course of the study . ) <p> While limiting " salty " foods like bacon and chips will help cut back on sodium , it 's things we do n't think of as " salty " that are often the biggest sources of hidden salt in our diets : bread and wraps are the worst culprits , accounting for almost 13 percent of our daily sodium . <p> " If you 're aiming to limit your sodium intake to the recommended level of less than 2300 milligrams per day , you 'll need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Harnack . <p> She also advised using packaged foods ' nutrition information panel to identify low sodium products : a low-salt food has less than 120mg of sodium per 100g , and over 400g per 100g is considered high salt . 
 <h> Cheese is n't bad for your heart , concludes giant British study <p> Word of the day : turophile , which is someone who really , really likes cheese . And it 's a great day for turophiles , with British researchers finding cheese does n't hurt your health . <p> For years , cheese fanciers have fretted that those helpings of brie , camembert and crumbly cheddar ( so good ) increase the risk of heart disease -- but a massive analysis by a University of Reading team , published in the European Journal of Epidemiology , indicates that may not be so . <p> The analysis , which included almost 1 million people , found that a diet high in cheese and other dairy foods did not boost the likelihood of heart disease , stroke or early death . <p> Researcher Jing Guo , a University of Reading nutrition scientist , said dairy has a " neutral association " on heart disease risk , and added that fermented dairy foods ( your cheeses and yoghurts ) might even improve heart health . <p> " This latest analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy foods is not necessarily damaging to health , " she said in a statement . <p> " There 's quite a widespread but mistaken belief among the public that dairy products in general can be bad for you , but that 's a misconception . While it is a widely held belief , our research shows that that 's wrong , " Ian Givens , a University of Reading professor of food chain nutrition , told The Guardian . <p> " There 's been a lot of publicity over the last five to 10 years about how saturated fats increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and a belief has grown up that they must increase the risk , but they do n't . " <p> The Reading research is sure to be controversial in the medical community ( and confusing to us everyday people ) , mostly because nutrition science is unbelievably complicated . The take-home message is , as usual , everything in moderation . <p> Professor Julie Lovegrove , another of the Reading investigators , said in a statement that the analysis " supports previous findings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be part of a healthy , balanced diet . " <p> The subtext : this is n't an excuse to eat cheese for breakfast , lunch and dinner , but you can stop fretting about enjoying that crumbly cheddar if your overall diet is pretty good . <p> Some Australian researchers are on board with that message . <p> " Despite decades of research on whether eating saturated fat increases our chances of dying from heart disease , the results are not consistent . Some show eating high saturated fat is bad , whereas others do not , " Yutang Wang , a senior lecture at Federation University Australia , wrote for The Conversation this week . <p> " We may need to stop thinking about ' bad ' saturated fat and ' bad ' cholesterol . Rather , we should enjoy our meals containing moderate amounts of saturated fat and be physically active . That will be more effective in keeping us healthy .

 <h> 7 natural ingredients that fight colds to eat this winter <p> Naturopath and herbalist Anthia Koullouros outlines her top ingredients to keep winter colds and flu at bay . <p> Garlic 's bulb and sprouts are traditionally used in herbal medicine to dissolve mucous and act as an anti-bacterial , anti-viral , anti-fungal , anthelmintic ( kills worms ) , warding off and treating infections of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems .

Consume a clove of garlic per day pounded with one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil or manuka honey consumed straight off the spoon or added to food while cooking . 
 <h> Why occasional calorie restriction can make you healthier <p> Fasting or significantly restricting calories for even a short period of time is often seen as a controversial practice . <p> Doctors have warned against diets like the lemon detox or the master cleanse , arguing that for most people fasting is not only pointless but can even be harmful . <p> But new research into periodic calorie restriction has revealed exciting potential benefits for human health , including a regenerative , anti-aging like effect on our cells . <p> Dr Valter Longo , the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California , lead some of the most recent research into calorie restriction ( CR ) , a study of 71 people that saw subjects follow a scientifically prepared " fasting-mimicking " diet -- consuming small amounts of natural ingredients the body does n't recognise as food . <p> As Longo told Coach , the final results depended on an individual 's overall health . But in general , study participants who followed the fasting diet for five consecutive days once a month for three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hormone linked to aging and age-related diseases . <p> A reduction in cholesterol and blood glucose levels was also common , and Longo and his team are currently conducting further research into the benefits CR may have for multiple sclerosis sufferers , after promising results from animal studies . <p> Longo said the reason fasting can cause this regenerative process in the cells is not completely understood and is still being researched , but it 's possibly a biological response from our " caveman " days , when food was sometimes scarce . <p> " There 's evidence that this is a potent way to affect aging by activating the body 's own ability to rejuvenate , " he says . <p> The hope , Longo says , is that occasional five-day fasting periods , be it once a month or once a year depending on a person 's health , could increase life expectancy , or at the least increase " health span " -- the years we are at our healthiest and most active . <p> Dr Julie Mattison from America 's National Institute on Aging ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study into the potential benefits of calorie restriction for human health , which tested the effect of CR on rhesus monkeys . <p> Monkeys that had their diets cut by 30 percent tended to live two years longer for males and six years longer for females . <p> Rhesus monkeys and humans share 93 percent of their DNA , so there 's a significant chance similar results could be seen in humans . <p> But Mattison says that while the results are promising , it will be challenging for scientists to prove the same results in humans . <p> " The ability for an intervention such as CR to lengthen the lifespan of humans is such a complex study that it is not likely to ever happen in the controlled setting that would be required to definitively answer that question , " Mattison explains . <p> Dr Longo from the human CR trial has formulated a " fasting-mimicking " diet being sold to the public via a company he founded , L-Nutra . ( Longo makes it explicitly clear that he does not benefit financially from the product in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated to charity . ) <p> Longo says the five-day meal plan , called ProLon , has been scientifically created to meet a person 's nutrition requirements , and also make doing CR safe . <p> " Simply giving people recipes to follow themselves is very dangerous , " Longo says . <p> " CR is probably more powerful than drugs , in terms of what it does to the human body , so there could be many different side effects , and people could make mistakes or a person could be doing it that should n't . " <p> He said it 's also to make CR less exclusive . <p> " Historically CR was always done in clinics and it was very expensive . People often had to fly a long way and spend thousands of dollars . I 'm pushing very hard for ProLon to be as inexpensive as possible . " <p> The ProLon five-day kit includes plant-based energy bars , soups , snacks like kale chips and olives , teas and supplements , providing a nourishing diet despite having a daily caloric intake of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and Italy , is launching this month in the UK , and will be for sale in Australia by the end of the year . In order to purchase ProLon , a customer has to take a health-assessment survey . <p> " If you 're a super healthy , mid-life person who exercises and has a perfect diet " -- which is only about 2 per cent of the population , Longo notes -- " you probably only need to do the fasting mimicking diet once or twice a year . <p> " For the average person , it 's probably every three to four months . <p> " If you are obese and have high cholesterol , high blood pressure , you probably need to do it once a month , " he says , adding it should be decided based on the advice of a doctor or nutritionist . <p> But even if there are proven health benefits to calorie restriction , is feeling hungry and not enjoying proper food for five days really worth it ? <p> It presents an existential question : would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have a shorter life and just eat the damn cake ? 
 <h> Coffee vs tea : a health showdown <p> Whether you live for coffee or ca n't live without tea , for most of us a cup of our hot brew of choice is what gets us out of bed in the morning . <p> But have you ever wondered if one is better for you than the other ? We asked Victoria Drake , PhD , Manager of the Micronutrient Information Centre at the Linus Pauling Institute at America 's Oregon State University what the science says . <h> Disease prevention <p> Despite what headlines on Facebook might lead you to believe , unfortunately coffee and tea are n't miracle ingredients . Even though frequent studies claim coffee can prevent X or tea improves Y , often the findings are n't as bullet-proof as they seem . <p> For example , the antioxidant benefits of tea and coffee are probably not as big as the commercial for your favourite brew brand claims . <p> " Some components of tea ( catechins , theaflavins , ECGC ) and coffee ( chlorogenic acids , trigonelline ) have shown antioxidant activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these antioxidant activities in vivo in a living organism is not clear , " says Drake . <p> " Most of these compounds do n't make it into your bloodstream , and when they do , your body often works hard to remove them . They often do n't spend enough time in the body to play a big role in antioxidant defenses . " <h> Diet <p> Black coffee or herbal tea with no added milk or sugar are equally healthy choices : it 's what you add to your cup that will determine how healthy the beverage is . <p> " Coffee and tea have virtually no carbohydrates , protein , or fat and thus no calories , " Drake explains . " Anything you add -- sugar or milk -- will add calories . <p> " Amount is everything and makes the difference between something considered ' healthy ' versus ' a poor choice . ' " <p> So if you drink your coffee as a latte , but go for green when you drink tea , then for you tea is a lower-calorie and probably overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tea with just a dash of milk , it does n't matter . Although , coffee is higher in caffeine , so if you 're trying to lower your caffeine intake , stick with tea . <h> The verdict <p> Despite coffee and tea lovers ' heated opinions , there 's no clear winner of this argument . While research has indicated that coffee can lower some cancer risks and tea may prevent some cardiovascular diseases , there 's not enough evidence yet to prove the benefits for humans health . <p> You 're better off using medically recommended strategies for avoiding those diseases -- so not smoking , avoiding excessive alcohol consumption , and exercising for at least 30 minutes a day , for example . <p> So long as tea or coffee is drunk with little to no added milk or sugar ( or the added milk or sugar is counted as part of your daily diet ) just drink whichever makes you happy . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Morning coastal walks with my brunette counterpart ? ? ? ? ? in town for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't wait to see you do your thing . ? ? ? ? ? ?

 <h> What foods to eat for a better night 's sleep <p> A 2011 study found adults who ate two kiwifruits ( or two kiwifruit , if you prefer it that way ) one hour before bedtime , every night for four weeks , improved pretty much every marker of sleep : they went to sleep faster , woke up faster , and slept better overall . The researchers , from Taipei Medical University , speculated that kiwifruit 's antioxidants and serotonin are responsible for its sleep-boosting powers . 
 <h> Hypertension : you could have high blood pressure and not know it <p> Hypertension , better known as high blood pressure , sounds like one of those things we probably do n't need to worry about until we get older . <p> But a recent study by the National Heart Foundation found that one in 12 Australians under 30 ( 311,000 people ) have high blood pressure , and 90 percent of those with the condition were not taking any action to treat it . <p> Current estimates are that nearly a million Australians aged 18 to 45 have high blood pressure , so it 's clearly something we need to be mindful of long before retirement age , especially since a person with hypertension often experiences no symptoms . <p> " High blood pressure is a silent killer because there are no obvious signs or symptoms , and too many Australians risk a heart attack by not monitoring their blood pressure " Professor Garry Jennings , Chief Medical Advisor at the National Heart Foundation , told Coach . <p> " More than 4 million Australians are walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure is dangerously high , or unaware that their treatment is not working well enough . " <p> " The main lifestyle causes of hypertension are unhealthy eating patterns , including eating too many salty foods , high alcohol intake , being overweight and being physically inactive , " Jennings explains . " Some medicines also raise blood pressure . " <p> The Heart Foundation 's official recommendation is that everyone over the age of 45 should have their blood pressure measured at least every two years . But given the condition is asymptomatic , anyone under that age should still get their blood pressure tested next time they 're at the doctor or at any Priceline Pharmacy store , given the risks of hypertension . <p> " Uncontrolled high blood pressure can not only lead to a heart attack or stroke , but it causes other serious illnesses like dementia and kidney disease , " Jennings explains . <p> " It is the leading risk factor for heart disease and , in the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study , almost 50 percent of heart disease deaths were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more deaths can be put down to high blood pressure than to any other single risk factor . " <p> If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure , healthy diet and regular exercise can help in managing it , but medication may be required . <p> " Blood pressure medicines do n't cure high blood pressure , but they help to control it , " Jennings says . " You have to keep taking the medicines regularly , often for the rest of your life -- do n't stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first . <p> " There is really solid evidence that blood pressure lowering medications prevent stroke , heart attack and premature death in people who need them .

 <h> You 're probably eating waaaaay more salt than you think <p> If you 've been keeping score , you know your daily limit of sodium is 2300mg ( about a teaspoon of salt ) , or 1600mg if you have high blood pressure . Watching your salt intake is super important -- but new research reveals most of us are pretty terrible at estimating how much we actually eat . <p> In the lead-up to World Hypertension Day on May 17 , researchers from the George Institute for Global Health asked 400 people in Lithgow , NSW to recall what they 'd eaten over the last 24-hour period . <p> ( FYI , table salt -- aka sodium chloride -- is about 40 percent sodium , so 9g a day is well over the 2.3g daily limit . ) <p> " Our results suggest people do n't realise just how much salt they are adding to their food either whilst cooking or at the table , " said Associate Professor Jacqui Webster , a co-author of the study , in a statement . <p> " Then they are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly consumed foods . " <p> " We need to stop adding salt unnecessarily onto our foods when preparing meals at home , " Webster said .

 <p> And as long as they 're not coated in salt or chocolate and you do n't scoff too many , nuts are also associated with long-term weight control despite their typically high calorie levels -- a surprising finding that scientists are still researching ( it may be the combo of fat , fibre and protein is effective at making us feel satisfied , so we eat less ) . <p> So next time you 're standing in the nut aisle at the supermarket , which type should you buy ? Which kind is the healthiest , in a nutshell ? <p> " Walnuts stand out as a clear winner , " according to nutritionist and founder of the Shape Me program Susie Burrell . <p> " Walnuts are known as a superfood because they contain exceptionally high amounts of long chain polyunsaturated ( LCP ) fats , which are crucial to optimize fat metabolism , " Burrell explains . <p> " For this reason individuals with high cholesterol especially can reap many benefits of adding 10 walnuts a day to their daily diet prescription . " <p> A 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat oxidation in their bodies was significantly elevated , and the inclusion of walnuts in their diet appeared " to reverse or normalize impaired fat oxidation . " <p> The benefits of walnuts do n't end there . They also have one of the highest concentrations of the plant source of omega 3 fat alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , which has anti-inflammatory properties and contributes to good heart health . <p> So how many walnuts should you eat per day ? Thirty grams , or about 10 walnuts , is the ideal amount to reap the benefits without blowing out your caloric intake . <p> " Aim for a nut-based snack late in the afternoon , " Burrell suggests . <p> " Not only will this help ward off the pre-dinner munchies , as nuts are a great source of protein and fibre , but the low carbohydrate content will help to taper off your fuel intake towards the second half of the day , which is conducive to weight control .

 <h> Why loneliness makes you sleep worse <p> Loneliness is a burden by itself , but it carries some dark side-effects : English researchers have determined that feeling lonely impacts how well you sleep . <p> Loneliness is n't the same thing as isolation -- you can feel lonely in a crowded room , or be all by yourself and not feel lonely . For the purposes of the study , loneliness was defined as that distressing feeling you experience when you perceive your social relationships to be inadequate . <p> The link between loneliness and sleep was uncovered by a team from King 's College London , who surveyed more than 2000 young adults on four questions : How often do you feel that you lack companionship ? ; How often do you feel left out ? ; How often do you feel isolated from others ? ; and How often do you feel alone ? <p> All up , a little over quarter of the participants reported occasional loneliness , with a further 5 percent reporting frequent loneliness . <p> In the month prior to the study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to fall asleep , how long they slept and how often they woke up in the night , and how they fared with sleepiness the next day . <p> The study , published in the journal Psychological Medicine , found lonelier people were 24 percent more likely to feel tired and have difficulty concentrating during the day . <p> Even after accounting for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety , which can take a hit on sleep , the link between loneliness and poor quality sleep remained . <p> " Diminished sleep quality is one of the many ways in which loneliness gets under the skin , " said Professor Louise Arseneault , from King 's College London 's Institute of Psychiatry , Psychology and Neuroscience , in a statement . <p> " Our findings underscore the importance of early therapeutic approaches to target the negative thoughts and perceptions that can make loneliness a vicious cycle . " <p> The researchers speculated that loneliness makes you sleep worse because it makes you feel less safe -- heightening your biological stress response and the release of the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violence ( be it from crime , sexual abuse , child maltreatment or violent abuse by family members or peers ) , they found the link between loneliness and poor sleep was almost 70 percent stronger among those exposed to the most severe forms of violence . <p> " Sleep is a state in which it is impossible to be vigilant for one 's safety , so feeling isolated from others could make it more difficult to sleep restfully , and even more so for individuals who have been exposed to violence in the past , " said researcher Timothy Matthews . <p> While loneliness is often associated with old age , it 's common at any stage of life -- particularly among the young adult age group surveyed in the study , who are often students living away from home for the first time . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Let 's be honest , we all love a combo deal , it makes you feel like you 're getting more for less , right ?

 <p> In a study published in PLOS One , researchers from San Diego State University investigated the factors contributing to indoor air pollution by installing air particle monitors in the homes of 300 families , which all had at least one child younger than 14 and one adult smoker . <p> For three months , the monitors scanned for particles including dust , fungal spores and combustion by-products ( such as those from cooking and candle-burning ) between 0.5 and 2.5 micrometers in size -- teensy enough to reach deep into human lungs and bring on a range of health problems , particularly for children . <p> " Our primary goal was to figure out what 's happening in houses that leads to higher air particle levels and in turn , to unhealthy environments for kids , " said study co-author and graduate student John Bellettiere in a statement . <p> , cigarette smoking proved to be the biggest contributor to in-home air pollution -- as did marijuana smoking , believed to be the first time such a finding has been reported . The smokers ' homes had particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-smokers . ( E-cigarettes had no effect . ) <p> Cooking with oil was also linked to higher air particle counts ( regardless of whether or not the food was burned ) . Somewhat ironically , the homes of the people who cleaned more -- by vacuuming , dusting and sweeping -- also had " dirtier " air , presumably because all that cleanliness stirs up more air particles . <p> Burning candles and incense was also determined to result in a " statistically significant increase " in indoor air particle counts , meaning you might have to sacrifice that romantic , sweet-scented ambience if you want the purest air possible . <p> Future research will look into the effects of second-hand marijuana smoke on non-smokers . Other San Diego State University scientists also specialise in researching " third-hand smoke " -- the chemicals that smoking leaves behind in upholstery , carpets , curtains and clothing . <p> The takeaway : do n't smoke , but if you do , do n't smoke indoors .

 <h> Why fitness is that one area in life where you can have it all <p> You 're not imagining it : fitness addicts really are training in every physical discipline these days , writes Scott Henderson , co-founder of Australian active swimwear label All I Sea . <p> One of the biggest fitness trends of the last 12 months has been multi-sport workout and it 's not hard to find proof of this rise . <p> There is the runner outside your office on his way to boxing , one of the 480 Australian F45 gyms on every block , and the nippers of all ages who take over your beach every single weekend . Do n't believe it ? Just try to find a carpark at your local beach on a Sunday morning . <p> Multi-sport training and its participants are now no longer a subculture forced into the shadows of underground CrossFit boxes , but are becoming the new norm . In fact , 88 perfect of Australian sport club members are involved in supplementary workouts on a weekly basis , according to the Medical Society for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a reflection of this trend , with heroes no longer always bred in the isolation of a single sport . The greatest multisport athletes in the world have followings in the hundreds of thousands , dwarfing the followings of our Olympic champions , and the sponsorship dollars that chase them are reflective of their influence . <p> These athletes reflect our personal desires -- they are good at everything . In a society where we want it all , fitness is now an outlet where we legitimately can , and the benefits of mixing it up when it comes to training keep adding up . <p> From a health and results perspective , keeping our body guessing by throwing in different styles of training into the one workout plan delivers great results , fast . Activating different muscles and energy systems through a variety of movements keeps the metabolism firing and always working to adapt to your next fitness outing . <p> According to research published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology , this variety and constant metabolic conditioning also ensures that athletes do n't adapt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cross training also decreases the chance of serious injury by decreasing the continuous and repetitive load on single sport specific muscle groups , increasing flexibility , and building the necessary muscle to support joints through a range of movements . <p> When it comes to burn-out and mindset , the big winner from mixing up your program is that your workouts are always interesting . <p> Multi-sport workouts mean different locations , different movements , and different training groups . You can train outside with your mates , find your Zen and recover in a yoga studio , and get some serious business done in the gym . <p> Variety in your program does n't mean you need to sacrifice routine or structure in your training , and the chaos can certainly be organized to meet any objective or need . The greatest athletes in the world following multi-sport training are those who follow a plan with firm goals and targets -- however they 're aware of the benefits of targeting all aspects of fitness . <p> While the multi-sport trend has been gathering momentum over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses . Apps and tech that promote access to exercise variety are experiencing continuing growth thanks to our increasing desires . <p> , the US based fitness app allowing users to book into a multitude of affiliate studios , has taken over the Australian market , while gyms and franchises that facilitate this variety have swept the nation , and even the world . Large tech firms Garmin , Fitbit , and Apple have all introduced new devices to not only measure running , but swimming and cross training also . <p> The uptake has been so strong that now includes apparel . It 's no longer enough to wear a daggy workout singlet that does n't enhance our performance , and brands are responding to the way we 're training . <p> Aussie brands such as All I Sea are pioneering transitional workout wear , which we 've dubbed " active swimwear " . The properties of pieces from these brands are conducive to all workouts , with high-performance fabrics , moisture management for both sweat and water , and compression supporting athletes from all walks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and performance driven that it will one day make athletes wonder how they completed multisport workouts without that functionality . <p> As excitement around multi-sport training continues to build , it 's the brands that know their consumers and their behaviors that will continue to innovate and pioneer this new category , rather than those who dictate the terms . <p> Fitness has always been an outlet and reflection for our desires and goals , and now " having it all " can be added to the list of reasons why we should continue to get our bodies moving . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Let 's be honest , we all love a combo deal , it makes you feel like you 're getting more for less , right ?

 <h> What you did n't know about polycystic ovary syndrome -- and how exercise can help <p> Dr Trine is a visiting fellow at the Mary Mackillop Institute for Health Research at Australian Catholic University , and the Head of Exercise , Cardiometabolic Health and Reproduction ( ) Research Group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology . Following her years of research , she reveals the benefits of exercise , specifically high intensity interval training , for those living with polycystic ovary syndrome and struggling to fall pregnant . <p> " It is so unfair , and I may never have kids . " I have met many young females through my research , and this is a common statement among women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . <p> However , despite the prevalence of PCOS among women of child-bearing age , the majority of women are n't diagnosed and for those who are , many do n't have a proper understanding of PCOS . <p> So , what do women need to know ? Here are five fast facts about PCOS. <h> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have PCOS <p> Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is an endocrine disorder affecting up to 20 percent of young women . <h> 2 . PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility <p> Many young females diagnosed with PCOS will suffer from irregular menstruations , excessive body hair , and struggle to fall pregnant . <h> 3. 50-70 percent of women with PCOS have insulin resistance <p> PCOS is also associated with several metabolic disorders , such as abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance . In fact , insulin resistance has been put forward as a central feature of PCOS , underpinning the reproductive and metabolic complications . <h> 4 . Not all women with PCOS are obese <p> Although PCOS is associated with obesity , far from all women with PCOS are obese . <h> 5 . Lifestyle intervention is regarded as first-line therapy for women with PCOS <p> A weight reduction of as little as 5-10 percent increases ovulation frequency and conception rates in women with PCOS , as well as reduces the levels of insulin in the blood . <h> How can exercise help ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we need to know more about what kinds of exercise ( type , amount , and intensity ) will be most effective . <p> Women with PCOS are often told that they need to lose weight , but get little help and guidance in doing so . Being told to generally " be active , eat less , eat healthier , and exercise " is not very specific and probably not all that helpful . <p> As part of a collaboration between the Mary Mackillop Institute for Health Research at Australian Catholic University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology , we 're exploring whether 16 weeks of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) will increase menstrual frequency in PCOS . <p> HIIT has been shown to have greater effects than traditional moderate intensity endurance training on various markers of cardiometabolic health in other patient populations . <p> Although the study is not yet completed , the HIIT training is expected to improve menstruation frequency among women with PCOS and four out of the 15 women who have completed the exercise program have fallen pregnant compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exciting , and gives hope to those young women with PCOS who fear they will never be able to bear children . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Let 's be honest , we all love a combo deal , it makes you feel like you 're getting more for less , right ?

 <h> No , you do n't have to sit in lotus pose to meditate <p> Pretend we 're playing charades and you 're told to mime meditation . What pose do you go into ? <p> You 've almost certainly put your hands out , palms facing up , with your first and second fingers touched to your thumb , into an approximation of what 's called lotus pose . <p> The pose has become linked to meditation in popular culture : search a stock image database for " meditation " and almost all the results show lotus pose ; and last year when I learned to meditate , people all had the same assumption of how I sat while I did it . " Like this ? " they 'd ask , pulling a quick lotus . <p> According to my meditation instructor Rory Kinsella , lotus pose -- or " padmasana " , from the Sanskrit -- is the traditional meditation pose used for centuries in India and other parts of Asia . <p> But in the modern-day West , where meditation is becoming increasingly popular , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-legged on the floor is at best unfamiliar , and at worst uncomfortable . <p> Fortunately , there 's no law demanding beginner meditators sit in lotus pose . The primary purpose of meditation is stress relief -- and that can be achieved by positioning yourself however you like ( with a few caveats ) . <p> " Most modern , westernised schools of meditation say a chair is fine and that finding a position where you are comfortable yet alert is what is most important , " Kinsella says . <h> How to sit when you meditate <p> Well , for starters , you should avoid meditating lying down , because you 'll probably go to sleep . ( You might still nod off if you 're sitting upright , but you 're more likely to snap out of it . ) <p> According to Kinsella , popular Buddhist and mindfulness practices suggest meditating while sitting in a chair , or on cushion on the floor if you prefer , in a comfortable yet alert position . <p> " The idea is to create a balance of relaxation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the chair with your legs uncrossed and your feet flat on the floor . Your hands can rest in your lap or on your thighs . Your back should be straight to allow ease of breathing and blood flow and you can rest your back for support if you need . ( This video from Andy Puddicome , founder of the meditation , explains more . ) <p> " Other popular schools of meditation including Vedic and transcendental prioritise comfort and relaxation and meditators are encouraged to sit comfortably in a chair , with their back supported but head and neck free , " Kinsella says . <p> The only hard rule is no slouching , but only because it does n't suggest you 've got your head in the meditation game . <p> " Your posture should reflect your intention for the practice -- whether it be cultivating focus or relaxing and de-stressing , " Kinsella explains . <h> Why lotus ? <p> Kinsella speculates the lotus pose is linked to meditation because it 's so recognisable -- the equivalent of a film establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower . It 's also a more evocative way to illustrate meditation than the more practical day-to-day poses . <p> " A picture of someone sitting unremarkably in a chair with their eyes closed does n't tell as good a story as the lotus , " Kinsella says . <p> But just because the pose is n't necessary for beginner meditators does n't mean it serves no purpose or that it 's " wrong " -- it might prove useful for some advanced or traditional meditators , particularly those embarking on lengthy meditation sessions . <p> " The lotus is said to allow the body to be keep still in the same spot for long periods , " say Kinsella . " It applies pressure to the lower spine and blood is directed from the legs to the abdominal region to aid digestion .

 <h> MIT 's living , breathing workout suit is the activewear of the future <p> In the not-too-distant-future , you 'll wrap yourself in a living , breathing , weird second skin before you work out . <p> That 's the prediction from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , whose researchers have designed a " breathable workout suit " spotted with ventilation flaps that adjust your temperature as you exercise . <p> Here 's the really sci-fi bit : the " biohybrid material " is crammed with bacteria that sense humidity , opening the flaps as you work up a sweat and pulling them closed when you cool down . Yes , the activewear is alive . <p> Cohen <p> " This work is an example of harnessing the power of biology to design new materials and devices and achieve new functions , " said Xuanhe Zhao , an MIT associate professor who worked on the project , in a statement . <p> " We believe this new field of ' living ' materials and devices will find important applications at the interface between engineering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from a superhero comic and its blockbuster adaptation , it 's published in the legit journal Science Advances , which reveals it was made by printing the microbial cells onto a layer of latex . <p> According to Wen Wang , the paper 's lead author , wearing the suit while pedalling on a stationary bike " felt like I was wearing an air conditioner on my back . " <p> While the MIT team intends to work with sportswear companies to commercialise the workout suit , for now it remains a proof-of-concept . Before it hits stores , researchers need to figure out how to keep the microbes alive in the right concentrations in the right places for the suit to work . <p> Some of the biggest challenges might be feeding the bacteria ( not to mention disposing of their waste -- yes , this activewear poops ) .

 <h> Better sleep could be the easiest way to lose weight and eat healthier <p> If your weight is slowly creeping up and your diet is impossible to control , your bad sleep habits could be to blame . <p> Research presented this weekend at the European Congress of Endocrinology in Lisbon , Portugal , demonstrates how chronic sleep loss messes up your body -- including your appetite , metabolism , motivation and physical activity -- in a way that leads to weight gain . <p> A team from Uppsala University , Sweden , reached this conclusion by recruiting groups of normal-weight people with healthy metabolisms then depriving them of sleep for a short period . The research revealed that sleep-deprived people , even those who 'd slept poorly for just one night , appear to seek pleasure from food . <p> They choose larger portions , consume more calories , and are more impulsive in their choices ( meaning you 're probably more likely to add discounted chocolate to your supermarket trolley after a restless night ) . <p> Bad sleep also slows down your metabolism , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone insulin , a condition known to lead to weight gain ; and it changes the balance of your gut bacteria , which likely screws up your metabolism even more . <p> Short version : bad sleep is bad for you . <p> " My studies suggest that sleep loss favours weight gain in humans , " said Dr Christian Benedict from Uppsala University in a statement . " Since perturbed sleep is such a common feature of modern life , these studies show it is no surprise that metabolic disorders , such as obesity are also on the rise . <p> It may also be concluded that improving sleep could be a promising lifestyle intervention to reduce the risk of future weight gain .

 <h> Treadmill workout : How to get the most out of your run <p> From being able to work out year-round to avoiding the risks of dog poo , there are plenty of good reasons to run on the treadmill instead of outdoors . <p> Although there is one major downside ( aside from when the person who used the machine before you does n't wipe off their sweat droplets ) : it can get monotonous when you 're in the same room doing the same routine , day in , day out . <p> It depends on what you 're training for -- maybe a marathon or to lose weight -- but there are ways to make every session on the treadmill more effective and fun . <h> Do intervals to burn more calories in less time <p> Interval training -- intense bursts of activity followed by a period of rest -- on the treadmill not only offers the benefit of fighting boredom , but allows you to burn a significant amount of calories in a short amount of time . <p> " For people who are really comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple and effective way to do high-intensity interval training is a 20-second fast run and then 20 seconds off , where you straddle the machine to be in complete rest , " explains Sydney exercise scientist Greg Stark , founder of Better Being and author of Sweat Equity : Peak Performance for the Leaders of Today and Tomorrow . <p> " For most interval training the whole workout should be no more than 15 minutes , and can be as short as five minutes , such as at the end of a resistance training session , " Stark says . <p> " It should get to a point where you 're at complete exhaustion -- you should feel like you ca n't do another repetition . " <h> Alternate between high intensity and recovery days <p> It 's easy to fall into a routine doing the same workout on the treadmill each day , but alternating between high-intensity sessions and recovery days will help you increase your fitness faster . <p> It 's also better for the body long-term , Stark says . <p> " It 's good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the latter doing exercise to help regenerate the body . It 's also better than doing nothing at all . For some people that might be walking at a steady pace for an extended period of time , for others a light jog . <p> " It should be comfortable and not taxing on the body , but at the same time you 're still burning calories . " <p> Stark says it 's important to listen to your body each day to determine what style of workout is right for you . <p> " Everyone 's going to be different every day -- one day you might be feeling really good and ready for a tough session , or if you have n't slept well you might decide to do a low demand walk or jog . <p> " Do n't think if you 're not pushing to 100 percent it means there are n't benefits -- doing something will get you a better result than nothing at all . " <h> Stimulate your brain <p> Boredom and lack of motivation is one of the biggest obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session early , or skip the gym altogether . <p> " A big part of running is the mental battle of it . Often your mind will give in before your body , so developing mental resilience is really important , " Stark explains . <p> There are several strategies you can use to stay engaged in your workout . <p> If you 're training for an event , try visualising yourself crossing the finish line , or increase the treadmill 's incline as you imagine yourself powering up tough hills . Or if your goal is to run three kilometres , break it down into six lots of 500 metres and focus on getting through each section , one at a time . <p> " Research has shown music can play a role in your exercise performance , and a lot of people listen to podcasts , which can be a great way to engage the mind , " Stark suggests . <p> As for whether you should catch up on an episode of Real Housewives while you 're on the treadmill , Stark says it depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intense , purposeful training session , TV is probably going to act as a distraction because you 're not completely focused on what you 're doing . <p> " But if you 're doing a training session that is more designed to regenerate or recover and make you feel better , TV could have value . " <p> But ultimately it 's important to enjoy your workout , so if TV helps you through the session , then go for it . <p> " It 's important to enjoy the process of getting fit because we 're more likely to stay engaged with it long term if it 's something we look forward to . <p> " If you like watching TV while you work out , it 's better than not going to the gym at all . It 's about what 's going to give you the greatest consistency and longevity from your exercise program . " 
 <p> More research is needed to understand exactly why this is , but it seems largely to do with the hippocampus , part of the brain which is vital for creating new memories . <p> The hippocampus shrinks in the final years of our lives , and is the part of the brain first and worst affected by Alzheimer 's . But studies have found the hippocampus responds quickly and positively to exercise . <p> A 2011 study of 120 elderly people published in scientific journal PNAS found that aerobic exercise grew the size of the anterior hippocampus , and led to improvements in memory . <p> The researchers say hippocampal volume increased by 2 percent , reversing age-related loss in volume by at least one to two years . <p> A 2011 study found that children who took part in aerobic fitness regularly were better at " relational binding " ( like recalling the name of a person you met recently and where you met them ) than less active kids . <p> A study of adult rats found that running increased the growth of new neurons in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study on mice found the neural benefits of physical exercise lasted up to two weeks after the session . <p> And another study of 1740 men and women aged 65 or older with no cognitive impairment at the beginning of the research found that six years later , incidence of Alzheimer 's was higher in those that exercised less than three times per week than those who exercised more frequently . <p> Aside from the hippocampus research , exercise will also reduce your chances of developing dementia because it decreases some key dementia risk factors including heart disease , stroke , high blood pressure , type 2 diabetes and obesity . <p> Art Kramer , director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and a Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois in the US , is about to begin a multimillion dollar study into this area of research . <p> " Exercise does n't just maintain cognitive ability , but actually improves it , " he told Coach . " In randomised control trials in sedentary older adults you find they improve memory , problem solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Kramer said while it 's exciting for older members of the population , parents should encourage their children to set up consistent exercise habits for life . <p> " Some of the research will focus on working with kids in after school exercise programs , because kids are becoming increasingly sedentary , increasingly obese . " <p> Alzheimer 's Australia recommends at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise , such as brisk walking , dancing , jogging , bicycling or swimming , on most days of the week . 
 <h> Your fitness tracker is n't great at measuring how many calories you 've truly burned <p> " My fitness tracker told me I burned hundreds of calories in today 's workout -- so I can scoff an extra couple of Tim Tams tonight without feeling guilty ! " Not so much : your device is pretty terrible at measuring what you 've actually burned . <p> That 's the outcome of Stanford University School of Medicine research that independently tested a range of wristband activity trackers , and determined that none of them accurately measure energy expenditure -- and some of them are way off . <p> The study , in the Journal of Personalized Medicine , used the Apple Watch , Basis Peak , Fitbit Surge , Microsoft Band , Mio Alpha 2 , PulseOn , and Samsung Gear S2 , strapping them to 60 volunteers who underwent a range of activities ( sitting , walking , running , and cycling ) . <p> Data from the trackers was then compared to data taken from " gold standard " medical-grade instruments that calculate metabolic rate ( that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the most accurate fitness tracker ( the Fitbit Surge ) misreported calories burned by an average 27 percent , while the least accurate ( the PulseOn ) was off by an average 93 percent . <p> " The energy expenditure measures were way off the mark . The magnitude of just how bad they were surprised me , " said Professor Euan Ashley , the study 's senior author , in a statement . <p> " People are basing life decisions on the data provided by these devices , " he said , adding that basing the number of doughnuts you eat on how many calories your device says you burned is a really bad idea . <p> Because the algorithms that fitness trackers use to estimate energy expenditure are closely guarded secrets , the Stanford team ca n't say for sure why these devices are n't great at measuring calories . <p> But the study 's lead author , graduate student Anna Shcherbina , speculated that it 's because the trackers have a " one size fits all " approach that fails at accounting for individual differences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard to train an algorithm that would be accurate across a wide variety of people because energy expenditure is variable based on someone 's fitness level , height and weight , etc , " she said . <p> ( This is the case for most fitness equipment , not just wrist trackers -- while the treadmill or stationary bike at the gym might insist you 've burned 300 calories in half an hour , that 's probably not the case . ) <p> On the bright side , the Stanford study found fitness trackers do a better-than-expected job at measuring heart rate , though factors such as an individual 's body mass index and skin tone affected their accuracy . 
 <h> Thanks to climate change , we 'll all probably sleep way worse in the future <p> As well as " oceans rising up around our necks " and " no more polar bears " , you can add " bad sleep forever " to the list of problems climate change is likely to bring up on us . <p> The hotter the night , the worse you sleep . So if average global temperatures continue to rise , our sleep will get worse -- and a new US study , published in the journal Science Advances , has calculated just how much worse . <p> The research concluded that every 1 degree Celsius rise in average night-time temperatures works out to three nights of insufficient sleep per 100 individuals per month . <p> So going by those numbers : a month of night-time temperatures of 1 degree above average in Australia would predict almost 750,000 extra nights of bad sleep ( or more than 8.5 million extra nights in a year ) . <p> Using NASA climate projection data , the study worked out that warmer temperatures will cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2050 and approximately 14 extra nights per 100 by 2099 . <p> " Too little sleep can make a person more susceptible to disease and chronic illness , and it can harm psychological well-being and cognitive functioning , " said Nick Obradovich , who conducted the research from the University of California San Diego , in a statement . <p> " What our study shows is not only that ambient temperature can play a role in disrupting sleep but also that climate change might make the situation worse by driving up rates of sleep loss . " <p> Obradovich reached his conclusions by linking sleep data collected from three-quarters of a million US adults over a 10-year period with temperature data , and combining it with climate model projections . <p> His calculations predict that the sleep impact of warmer temperatures will be worse in summer ( ... obviously ) , and that the sleep of older people and the less financially well-off will be harder hit by climate change . <p> " We do n't have sleep data from around the world , but assuming the pattern is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or poorer or both , what we 'd find could be even worse , " Obradovich said . 
 <h> Why it 's good to be bored sometimes <p> In F. Scott Fitzgerald 's novel The Crack Up , the author shares a pretty profound thought on how boredom can make us more creative . <p> " Boredom is not an end-product ... rather an early stage in life and art , " he writes . " You 've got to go by or past or through boredom , as through a filter , before the clear product emerges . " <p> Given the guy wrote some of the most iconic books of our time , it 's fair to say he knows something about how boredom is n't something to be avoided at all costs , but in fact serves a purpose . <p> American writer and researcher Mary Mann explores this idea in her just-released book Yawn : Adventures in Boredom . After years of research , Mann says that , in the same way an uncomfortable yoga pose can lead to more flexibility on the mat , boredom is something we should embrace to encourage creative thinking . <p> " Scientifically we can say that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " In one study , people who were bored before being given a problem to solve generally had more creative solutions . " <p> Mann is referring to a UK study that gave participants various boring tasks to complete ( not the most thrilling study to be a part of ) and then asked them to do something that required creative thinking . <p> The participants forced to do the dullest activities ( such as reading the phone book ! ) came up with the most innovative uses for plastic cups . <p> It seems when we allow our minds to wander , it gives the brain a workout . <p> " If you are bored , and keep resisting distractions from your boredom , you think of things to keep you from being bored . You are doing that action , instead of using something to do that for you , " Mann explains . <p> Having reviewed countless studies about boredom ( which ironically sounds fascinating ) Mann believes that if boredom serves any evolutionary purpose , it 's a " motivating force " that pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us happy . <p> " Boredom 's function is to let us know that what we 're doing in the moment is n't fulfilling us or giving us meaning , to push us to do something else . " <p> But is it even possible to be bored anymore , thanks to Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , Netflix , HBO , Candy Crush and YouTube ? Thanks to the phones in our pockets , we now have a staggering number of ways to fill those once excruciatingly dull parts of the day , like waiting for an elevator or standing in line at the supermarket check-out . <p> But technology does n't seem to have alleviated society of boredom at all . <p> " Boredom still exists in modern life , despite all of those possible distractions , " Mann says . <p> " According to a survey of teenagers all over the world by MTV , one of the most boring things in their lives is searching the internet . " <p> It 's true -- despite all the methods of distraction available to them , teenagers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have Netflix and Snapchat . <p> So what does that tell us about what boredom really is , if not just an absence of something to do ? <p> " I describe boredom as a feeling of restlessness , the feeling that you are not doing what you want to do , but also not knowing what that is , " Mann says . <p> " It 's irritating . But as Fitzgerald said , it 's a thing to power through in order to hopefully have ideas and learn about ourselves and what we want through that process . " <p> So while scrolling through your phone on public transport apparently wo n't make you feel any less bored , next time you are struck with the frustrating sensation of boredom , resist trying to scratch that itch with Netflix . <p> Instead , sit with the feeling -- you might finally solve a problem that 's bugging you or have a million-dollar app idea . Or just realise that you deeply desire eating Thai for lunch . <p> " Ask yourself what about this moment is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann suggests . " What other things might you want to be doing ? Or how can you do what you 're differently ? <p> " Try to sit with it and congratulate yourself for bearing with it for another few minutes .

 <h> How to cook up winter soups and stews without giving yourself food poisoning <p> Beware those winter soups , stews and casseroles -- if you do n't know what you 're doing , your hearty bowl of goodness could turn into a toilet bowl of badness . <p> That 's the latest warning from the Food Safety Information Council , which has issued a reminder that cooking winter foods in bulk can be a recipe for food poisoning . <p> " Cooking in bulk is cost effective , saves time and reduces food waste , " said council chair Rachelle Williams in a statement . <p> " However , we need to be extra careful handling these large amounts of food because , if they are left to cool slowly , bacteria can grow and produce dangerous toxins that wo n't be destroyed by further cooking . " <p> If you only remember one kitchen safety tip this winter , remember this one : when your food has stopped steaming , divide into portions the size of takeaway containers then refrigerate or freeze it immediately . That means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria . <p> ' Refrigerated leftovers should be used or frozen within two to three days . They will keep several months in the freezer , " Williams advised . " When reheating food ensure that it is hot all the way through , follow any microwave instructions to stir it or leave it to stand and use a thermometer to ensure it is at least 75 degrees Celsius in the centre . " <p> If you 're a slow cooker aficionado ( and if you 're not , you should be ) , Williams advised to read its instruction manual and always make sure your food is kept at a safe holding temperature of 60 degrees or above until you eat it . <h> Previous <p> Permission to sit out today 's workout ? ?

 <p> Sorry to be burst your bubble as you fry up enough slices of bacon for breakfast , lunch and dinner , but the article in the British Journal of Sports Medicine that sparked the discussion has been widely discredited by much of the medical world . <p> The editorial by UK cardiologist Aseem Malhotra and colleagues , titled " Saturated fat does not clog the arteries : coronary heart disease is a chronic inflammatory condition , the risk of which can be effectively reduced from healthy lifestyle interventions " , argues the idea of " dietary saturated fat clogging a pipe is just plain wrong " and there 's " no association between saturated fat consumption and ... coronary heart disease , stroke or diabetes in healthy adults . " <p> The authors have based their " findings " off a " landmark systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies " -- but none of the various pieces of research it cites found conclusive results about the effect of saturated fat on the heart . <p> Since its publication the article has been criticised by many respected health professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cardiologist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at America 's John Hopkins Hospital , says the piece is misguided for two reasons : first , the claim that a diet high in saturated fats is n't bad for heart health is proven to be wrong ; second , some of Dr Malhotra 's supposed counter arguments are n't even disputed by the medical world to begin with . <p> " It 's well established that a diet high in saturated fat raises levels of LDL " bad " cholesterol over years and years , and is a critical risk factor or cause of plaque build-up in the arteries , " Dr Martin told Coach . <p> Dr Martin said the editorial oversimplifies the cause of heart disease , especially when it argues " the model of dietary saturated fat clogging a pipe is just plain wrong . " <p> " No one is saying that it happens like that , that you eat saturated fat one minute and the next you have plaque , " Dr Martin said . " It happens over decades . <p> " Heart disease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardiovascular risk occurs due to a confluence of factors , including but not limited to cholesterol , age , blood pressure , cigarettes , diet , diabetes and lack of exercise . <p> " Often it 's several factors combined that leads to the build-up of plaque , which ruptures and results in a heart attack . <p> " We focus with our patients in our centre on comprehensive risk factor modification control to improve their outcome to avoid heart attack and stroke . " <p> And while the article proclaims " heart disease is a chronic inflammatory condition " as if it 's a new finding , Dr Martin says , again , no one is disputing that . <p> " Professionals absolutely agree that there 's an inflammatory component to plaque and heart disease , but it 's not one or the other . Cholesterol , lipids and inflammatory disease are all part of the pathway to plaque deposition in the arteries . " <p> Dr Martin believes the editorial is actually pretty irresponsible , since some of us may take it as gospel since it was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned that there 's a danger in spreading a message that tells people they can eat as much saturated fat as they want , and that the piece seems to be highly critical of established science and very well proven therapies , " he said . <p> So what is the scientifically backed word on how to maintain a healthy heart ? <p> " Move more , eat less , " as Dr Martin summed it up . <p> He says clinical studies have shown the DASH diet ( it stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension , which is intended to lower blood pressure and recommends reducing portion sizes and sodium and eating a nutrient rich diet ) and the Mediterranean diet are the best for lowering lipids and reducing inflammation . <p> " Diets that are rich in fresh fruits , vegetables , beans , legumes and fresh fish , " Dr Martin said , offering some simple swaps you can make to improve your daily diet : <p> " Use olive oil instead of butter , spices instead of salt and drink water instead of sugary soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible .

 <h> Why eating late at night is sabotaging your health and weight <p> We all know that cracking out the chips and M&amp;Ms or tucking into ice-cream late at night is n't going to be good for your waistline . <p> But it turns out even eating what you consider to be healthy food later in the evening is n't helpful for maintaining or losing weight either -- and if you generally eat dinner or snack a lot after 8pm , it could be sabotaging your best health intentions . <p> " Our metabolism and hormones are programmed to do their work in the day when humans are active , and then store , build and recover at night when we rest . <p> " This means that in order to keep our metabolism at its best , ideally we will eat most of the calories we need during the day , and then allow our bodies to have 10-12 hours without food overnight . When it comes to dinner , this means ideally we should try and consume our last meal of the day by 8pm at the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist snacking between dinner and going to bed , do n't worry , you 're not alone . According to Burrell , it 's the time of the day we 're most vulnerable to cravings and likely to run out of willpower . <p> " Self-control is like a muscle that loses its efficiency as the day progresses , especially if it 's the time of day you 've become programmed to treat yourself while watching TV , socialising or to soothe yourself after a tiring , stressful day . " <p> Unfortunately , like with any long-term health results , there 's no quick-fix solution . <p> " Stick to a personal rule that you have one portion-controlled treat each night , or that you do not eat after dinner , no exceptions , " Burrell suggests . <p> " The first night you try and break a habit , it is difficult . The second , maybe not so easy either -- but once you get three or four days under your belt , you 'll be well on your way to owning and managing your tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without food overnight , ideally 10-14 hours , the better it is for the hormones that control fat metabolism , " Burrell says . <p> If you ca n't avoid eating late at night , due to your working hours or other commitments , there are things you can do to minimise the negative impacts . <p> " If you regularly find yourself eating dinner after 8pm , it may be worth swapping your evening meal to lunchtime and then enjoying a lighter snack in the evening , " Burrell advises . <p> If you struggle to make a healthy choice when you get home late , get organised and make a batch of vegetable-based soup , meat and vegetables , or a frittata , and freeze it in portioned containers so you always have something nutritious and light to eat . <p> " Keep a supply of tinned soups , tins of beans , tuna or salmon and one or two salad vegetables that can be converted into a quick , yet nutritious meal in no time . " <p> And when possible , try to resist ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase away from the home will contain at least 200-300 calories more than the same meal you would prepare at home thanks to the extra oils , sauces and condiments.

 <h> Feeling rejected ? Swearing out loud could ease your #@$ ! -ing pain <p> Stub your toe or slam a finger in a car door , and it 's oh-so-satisfying to unleash a string of unprintable four-letter words . <p> That 's because swearing really does increase your threshold for physical pain , famously proven by Keele University psychologist Richard Stephens in 2009 : he demonstrated that people coped with the pain of plunging their hands into ice water better when they repeated a swear word of their choosing than when they repeated a neutral word . <p> But there are two types of pain -- the physical and the emotional . And according to new research out of New Zealand published in the European Journal of Social Psychology , swearing is as good for easing emotional pain as it is the physical kind . <p> Dr Michael Philipp , a lecturer at Massey University 's School of Psychology , tested swearing 's impact on " short-term social distress " by splitting Queensland-based study participants into two groups -- swearers and non-swearers . <p> Both groups then wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a break-up , or not being invited to a party all your friends are at ) . Guess which group coped better with recalling their dark moments ? <p> " The results suggest that socially distressed participants who swore out loud experienced less social pain than those who did not , " said Philipp in a statement . <p> The swearers also reported less physical pain , in line with Stephens ' finding . <p> Philipp conducted the experiment as part of his research into pain overlap theory , which posits that both physical pain and social pain are rooted in the same biological process , and that one type of pain increases sensitivity to the other . <p> " Pain overlap theory suggests that social distress feels painful because both social and physical pain are biologically coupled , " Philipp explained . <p> " Pain overlap theory predicts that anything affecting physical pain should have similar effects on social pain . " <p> It 's not yet clear why swearing is good at easing pain , but according to Philipp , it could be because a satisfyingly naughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " There is still speculation about why swearing aloud has the effect it does on physical pain and social pain , " he said . " What 's clear is that swearing is not a completely maladaptive reaction to a sore thumb or a broken heart . " <p> Philipp concluded that swearing is only a useful balm for lower-intensity downers , and not for serious emotional pain stemming from things like grief , abuse or other trauma . <p> Also be cautious about unleashing curse words over every tiny inconvenience : Philipp warned that a constant torrent of filth appears to weaken the power of profanity when you need to lessen social pain the most ( like when your ex rears up on social media living his best life , gosh f---king darnit ) . <p> That squares with research from Stephens , who showed in 2011 that frequent swearers are n't protected from physical pain as much as those who only let loose when they really need it . 
 <h> Social jet lag : Why sleeping late on weekends can be bad for your heart <p> " I 've slept like crap this week -- but I 'll sleep in a bit this weekend to make up for it , and I 'll be fine . " Except if you repeat this pattern long enough , you ca n't make up for it and you wo n't be fine . ( Sorry . ) <p> Going to sleep and waking up later on weekends than during the week has picked up the nickname " social jet lag " -- which is essentially when the time your body 's built-in clock ( or circadian cycle ) wants you to sleep does n't sync up with the time your lifestyle actually permits you to sleep . <p> Research presented at the SLEEP 2017 conference indicates that social jet lag not only increases tiredness and bad moods , but also increases your likelihood of poorer overall health , particularly your risk of heart disease -- which increases by 11 percent for every hour of social jet lag . <p> The study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) journal Sleep , reached those conclusions by analysing the sleep patterns and health of almost 1000 US adults . <p> Lead author Sierra Forbush , a sleep researcher from the University of Arizona , said the research indicates that a solid sleep routine is vital for good health -- perhaps more important than just trying to get more sleep . <p> " A regular sleep schedule may be an effective , relatively simple , and inexpensive preventative treatment for heart disease as well as many other health problems , " she suggested in a statement . <p> Speaking to Coach in March , Dr Andrew Rochford advised that setting up good sleep habits demands a bit of work and determination , both at the start and the end of your day . <p> " Shut off technology and TVs before going to bed to remove that artificial light source , " he recommended . " To help your body wind down , try and avoid any exercise that 's really high intensity , and mentally relax by taking a hot shower or a soak in the tub . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as you wake up . When you do that , your eyes are exposed to natural sunlight and your natural body clock senses that it 's time to truly wake up .

 <h> Five things you need for the perfect pop-up gym <p> You do n't need a lot of equipment to exercise -- you can get a great workout with no equipment at all , and you only need to add a few pieces to build a fitness program worthy of a fully stocked gym . <p> But which pieces ? Australian Olympic weightlifter and Reebok athlete Tia-Clair Toomey weighs in with some essential equipment suggestions ( which she used at the Reebok Delta Gym that recently popped up on an inner-city Melbourne rooftop ) . <h> Wall ball ( aka medicine ball ) <p> According to Toomey , these are one of the most underrated items in the gym because of the range of different exercises you can do with them -- including weighted squats , weighted sit-ups , or combinations of movements . <p> " The best thing about the wall ball is versatility , " says Toomey , who is ranked as the world 's second fittest woman by the CrossFit Games . " It works not only lower body , but there are a lot of movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " <p> If you do n't have a wall ball , she suggests buying a two-litre bottle of water to use as a weight instead . <h> Kettlebell <p> " The kettlebell is the CrossFitter 's weapon of choice , " Toomey says . <p> That 's because they 're small but tremendously versatile , able to work out your whole body if you 're confident incorporating advanced movements . And unlike dumbbells , that require you to invest in a range of weights , you can get away with using just kettlebell . <p> Toomey has an easy replacement if you do n't want to buy actual kettlebells : " Try a bag of oranges or potatoes . " <h> Boxes <p> The height of your box jump is pretty much the metric CrossFitters judge themselves by , and you can have a box jump without a box . <p> " Boxes do n't look like much , but they keep you honest in your workout , " Toomey says . " It 's really hard to cheat a rep on these ! " <p> A box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor furniture -- can be used for a range of exercises that goes far beyond jumps . <p> " You can perform movements at low and high intensity , one leg or two . Importantly , they build up leg power in no time . " <h> Skipping rope <p> " I know -- sounds horrible to most people , but this can be your best friend , " says Toomey . <p> The reason the skipping rope is such a valuable weapon is that it 's so easily incorporated into your everyday exercise . It elevates the heart rate , and breaks up your workout without having to use weights . <p> Toomey recommends setting tiny milestones to stay committed to your skipping regimen : " When starting out aim for one minute of skipping , and slowly increase over time . " <h> Your own body <p> The equipment above is incredible gear , but nothing ultimately beats your own body . <p> " Body weight exercises are the best type of exercises , " Toomey explains . That 's both because they can be as low or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squats , push-ups and the dreaded burpee can be done pretty much anywhere . <h> Previous <p> What does red lipstick and activewear have in common ?

 <p> So where does the poor egg 's rep for being bad for the heart come from ? <p> Recent research found eggs are more popular among Australians under 35 , compared to those over 60 who are more hesitant to eat them , so it could be one of those old misconceptions that 's been passed down from one generation to the next , like the belief all fat is bad for you . <p> ( Advice from your elders does tend to stick -- to this day I wo n't swim for an hour after eating because when I was little my Nana told me I could drown , even though this is proven to be a myth . ) <p> Even though we 've cleared up the egg thing , there 's still a lot of confusion about how to best manage cholesterol , as a recent American Heart Association survey found . <p> " We wanted to get a sense of what people know about their cholesterol risk and its connection to heart disease and stroke , as well as how people engage with their healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bauman , a member of the American Heart Association 's cholesterol advisory group , said in a statement . <p> " We found even among those people at the highest risk for heart disease and stroke , overall knowledge was lacking and there was a major disconnect between perceptions about cholesterol and the significance of its health impact . " <p> So what is the best way to keep cholesterol down ? <p> " The best way to avoid high cholesterol is to watch the amount of saturated and trans fat consumed , and eat foods naturally high in healthy fats , " McGuckin says . <p> " Avocado , nuts , seeds and oily fish such as salmon can help to increase our healthy cholesterol levels , which is protective against heart disease . " 
 <h> Brown bread is better than white bread , right ? For you , maybe not <p> It is a truth universally acknowledged that white bread is the worst and darker , seedier varieties are always better -- but an intriguing new study suggests some people are better off eating plain ol ' white . <p> A research team from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel recruited 20 healthy participants who normally ate 10 percent of their daily calories from bread . <p> Half were assigned to eat processed packaged white bread , and half ate specially baked whole wheat sourdough , with both groups upping their bread consumption to about 25 percent of their calories . <p> After a week on their ( incredible-sounding ) diets , the participants took a two-week break , then swapped onto the other kind of bread for a week . <p> Throughout the study period , researchers monitored the participants ' levels of glucose , calcium , iron , magnesium , fat and cholesterol , as well as their kidney and liver enzymes , and markers for inflammation . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study ( published in the journal Cell Metabolism ) first seemed to indicate there was no particular disadvantage or advantage to eating it . <p> " The initial finding , and this was very much contrary to our expectation , was that there were no clinically significant differences between the effects of these two types of bread on any of the parameters that we measured , " said Eran Segal , a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science and one of the study 's senior authors , in a statement . <p> But when the team pored over their data , they discovered some of the participants had a better glycemic response to one type of bread , while other participants had the opposite response -- so when averaged together , it only appeared there was no difference between the two types of bread . <p> For example , one obese woman involved in a 2015 Weizmann study ate tomatoes because she considered them healthy -- not realising tomatoes had a unique effect on her blood sugar levels that caused them to spike , making it harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat the " right " foods . <p> Ditto for bread : While you might favour dark rye thinking it 'll do you good , you personally might be better off with a sponge-like $1 loaf of white bread . <p> The Weizmann team believes the differences in how we respond to food are largely down to our gut microbiomes -- which are as one-of-a-kind as your fingerprints . That 's the logic underpinning their Personalised Nutrition Project , which analyses your microbiome ( via a pleasant li'l poo sample ) to predict what response you 'll have to certain foods . <p> Segal said this approach makes a lot more sense than putting everyone on " one-size-fits-all diets which have failed miserably " . <p> " These findings could lead to a more rational approach for telling people which foods are a better fit for them , based on their microbiomes , " he said . 
 <h> Friends more important for lifelong health than family , psychologist says <p> Things you have to work at if you want to stay healthy into old age : Eating right . Exercising regularly . And nurturing your friendships -- which , according to new research , are more important for long-term health than your family . <p> " Friendships become even more important as we age , " said William Chopik , an assistant professor of psychology at Michigan State University , in a statement . <p> " Keeping a few really good friends around can make a world of difference for our health and wellbeing . So it 's smart to invest in the friendships that make you happiest . " <p> In the first of two studies , published in the journal Personal Relationships , Chopik analysed data drawn from more than 270,000 people around the world who were surveyed on their relationships and how they rated their own health . <p> Family did indeed prove important for bolstering health and happiness ( something to note before telling your annoying sister to nick off ) -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness into old age . <p> Chopik said his results add to a pool of research proving the importance of friendships for long-term health . <p> " These studies show that friendships predict day-to-day happiness more and ultimately how long we 'll live , more so than spousal and family relationships , " he said , explaining that might be because family time sometimes involves serious , negative and monotonous interactions ( cue flashback to every awful family Christmas lunch ever ) . <p> The second of Chopik 's two studies , which looked at a separate survey of more than 7000 older adults from the US , examined the impact of friendships on health . <p> Intriguingly , the data suggested that people whose friends are a source of strain in their lives are more likely to suffer chronic illnesses , while people whose friends are a source of support are more likely to be happier . ( The takeaway : time to think about ditching those drainer and toxic friends . ) <p> Chopik mused that it 's strange friendships often taken a " back seat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're more influential than the other connections in your life . <p> " If a friendship has survived the test of time , you know it must be a good one -- a person you turn to for help and advice often and a person you wanted in your life , " he said . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Are you feeling unstoppable today ? shows us how to hustle for our goals in her Unbreakable Set - if you need this in your life visit us instore or shop via the link in bio ! #thisisactiveliving #lornajane #movenourishbelieve #activeliving 
 <h> The benefits of worrying <p> If you 're the kind of person that worries a lot , you 've probably even worried that you worry too much . <p> But you can take at least one item off your list of things to angst about for now , because new research says there are benefits to worrying . <p> Kate Sweeny , a psychology professor at the University of California , reviewed more than 50 scientific studies of worry and anxiety and came to the conclusion that worry serves some important purposes . <p> In her paper ' The Surprising Upsides Of Worry ' , published in Social and Personality Psychology Compass , Sweeny writes that worrying often motivates us to take precautions that keep us healthier and safer -- for example , wearing a seatbelt in the car , practicing safe sex , getting vaccinations and health tests , or wearing sunscreen . <p> " Worry illuminates the importance of taking action to prevent an undesirable outcome , and keeps the situation front of mind to ensure appropriate action is taken . " <p> It makes sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study harder , or that coming into harm 's way on holiday might make you take extra precautions , like staying in a safe neighbourhood or avoiding travelling at night . <p> Sweeny also writes that worrying can help us to be prepared in case of bad news . <p> In a study of American students that found out they 'd failed the bar exam , those who had worried about failing took more immediate and efficient action upon learning of the results , while those who had not worried experienced more emotional distress . <p> " Worry can motivate proactive efforts to assemble a ready-made set of responses ... worry motivates preparation and prevention . " <p> The other benefit of worrying , according to Sweeny , is that after worrying , otherwise normal experiences feel especially good compared to the former feeling of angst . <p> A classic example of this is when you 're pleasantly surprised a needle does n't hurt as much as you expected , or how amazing everyday life is after you 've been sick . <p> " People who fixate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of extra elation and relief if the news is good and diminished disappointment if the news is bad . " <p> Australian health psychologist Dr Lauren Hamilton agrees worrying can be helpful -- in small doses . <p> " Worry is like a warning system that tells us something might not be right , " Hamilton told Coach . " It can help us to do the things we need to do to keep our health , relationships and life on track . " <p> But given the negative effects on our physical and mental health from excessive worrying -- the possibility of developing an anxiety disorder , disrupted sleep and appetite and poor performance at work or in relationships among them -- it 's important to know the difference between occasionally warranted concern and all-consuming , unhelpful anxiety . <p> " Worrying becomes a problem when we feel distressed , consumed or paralysed by the worry , if it 's affecting our presence or performance in important areas of our life , or if it 's the only motivator we have , " Hamilton says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Is this a problem that is likely to happen , that would really matter if it did happen , and that I can take action to prevent or resolve ? ' If not , let it go . " <p> Hamilton says the best two things to do when you 're feeling worried are breathing deeply and slowly , and talking it out with someone you trust . <p> " Exercising regularly , eating a nutritious diet , and practicing meditation , mindfulness , and self-compassion are also helpful . <p> " Notice when you 're worrying and remind yourself it 's just a thought and you can choose how much power you give it . <p> " With practice you can learn to refocus your thinking to be more helpful and to help you take action in a meaningful way .

 <h> Double your chances of weight loss with a vegetarian diet <p> If the straight-up health benefits of eating more vegetables has yet to encourage you to , y'know , eat more vegetables , this might get you over the line : New research suggests a vegetarian diet is twice as good at cutting body fat than other diet plans . <p> For the study , published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition , researchers assigned 74 participants with type 2 diabetes to one of two diets for six months : either a vegetarian diet , or a conventional diabetic diet . <p> The vegetarian dieters stuck to vegetables ( ... obviously ) , grains , legumes , and fruits and nuts , with their only animal-derived food coming from a single portion of low-fat yoghurt every day . About 60 percent of their calories came from carbohydrates , 15 percent from protein , and 25 percent from fat . <p> The diabetic dieters adhered to the recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes ( outlined here ) , with 50 percent of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less than 30 percent from fat ( and most of that unsaturated fat ) . <p> All the subjects dropped their daily calories by 500 , and did n't change their usual exercise routines for the first half of the study . In the second half , they were each prescribed a three-times-a-week exercise program . <p> At the end of the study , the vegetarian dieters had lost an average 6.2kg -- compared to 3.2kg lost on the conventional diet . <p> The researchers , from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington DC , also used magnetic resonance imaging to determine where the participants had lost body fat from . <p> Both groups of dieters lost more or less the same amount of subcutaneous fat -- the kind that lies right under the skin and generally is n't harmful to health . But only the vegetarian dieters lost subfascial fat ( the kind on the surface of muscles ) , and they lost significantly more intramuscular fat ( the fat threaded inside muscles ) . <p> " Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , Dr Hana Kahleov ? , in a statement . " However , we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat , thus improving metabolism . <p> " This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight , including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes . <p> " But it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy . " <h> How to trick yourself into eating more vegetables <p> Fortunately , new research from Stanford University has uncovered a simple -- and brilliantly ridiculous -- strategy to trick yourself into making vegetables more appealing . Basically , you just give them over-the-top names . <p> Psychologists came to this charmingly absurd conclusion by serving the exact same vegetables in a university cafeteria for several months , and only changing how the dishes were labelled : <p> The research , published in JAMA Internal Medicine , showed that the indulgent labels appeared to overturn the subconscious mindset that healthy foods do n't taste as good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-top descriptions , and also ate more of them . <p> The takeaway : Do n't make yourself a boring old salad for lunch .

 <p> Not having the time , or not enjoying exercise , are a couple of the main reasons we 're likely to skip a workout . But an effective HIIT session can be as short as 15 minutes and still get results , making it hard to justify not making like Nike and just doing it . <p> " HIIT is a training technique where the individual gives 100 percent effort through quick , intense bursts of activity , " Beth Sheehan , a professional practice advisor from Exercise and Sports Science Australia ( ESSA ) , explained to Coach . <p> " While other forms of exercise increase your heart rate , HIIT allows you to maintain your heart rate at a higher level throughout the session . " <p> The formula of a HIIT workout pushes the body to burn more fat and build more lean muscle mass than when exercising at a steady pace . <p> " Studies have shown that with HIIT there is a dramatic improvement in exercise performance despite the low training volume . Many people report significant health benefits such as weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness compared to longer sustained workouts " Sheehan revealed . <p> From a mental perspective , many find a HIIT workout less challenging than going at a steady pace for a longer time , because it only requires short periods of going full-ball with plenty of chances to recharge , catch your breath and get ready to go again . <h> Your body keeps burning long after the workout <p> The idea that you can sit on the couch watching Netflix and burn a significant amount of calories sounds too good to be true , but that 's what the " after burn effect " is . <p> The intense level of training performed during a HIIT session means your body has to draw in more oxygen afterwards to repair itself , forcing the metabolism to work harder for hours , even up to a couple of days after a high-intensity interval workout . <p> This means it 's not necessary to do a HIIT workout every day : you 'll get just as good results by alternating between a HIIT one day and a LISS ( low-intensity sustained state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail 30 to 60 minutes of activity such as walking , cycling or swimming at about 60 percent of maximum heart rate , also contribute to weight loss and efficient fat burning because oxygen is more easily delivered to the body during this style of exercise , and oxygen is needed to break down fat . <p> LISS sessions also help the body to recover and be at an optimal state for maximum performance at the next HIIT session . <h> You do n't need fancy equipment or a gym membership <p> Joining a gym or having a personal trainer are both great ways to keep you accountable , and less likely to hit the snooze button and skip a workout . Plus the social element can turn exercising into something fun , not a grueling chore . <p> But if you do n't have the funds for an F45 membership or PT , you can easily do HIIT on your own at home or in the park , because all you need is exercise clothing . <p> " Box jumps , step-ups , star jumps , skipping , boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbers are just a few of the moves a person could use to do an effective HIIT workout . " <p> If you 're a runner , turn a normal run to a HIIT session by sprinting for two minutes and walking for two minutes , or sprinting for 30 seconds and jogging for 90 seconds . <p> Sheehan does warn , however , that HIIT may not be for everyone . <p> " If you 're new to exercising some one-on-one sessions or coaching around the ballistic and fast paced nature of HIIT would be wise to assist in preventing injuries . <p> " If you are someone with a history of musculoskeletal injuries like lower back pain , knee or ankle injuries or shoulder dislocations for example , consult an accredited exercise professional to ensure you are ready for the exercises , or discuss how HIIT can be modified for your specific needs .

 <h> Why an apple a day really does keep the doctor away <p> " An apple a day keep the doctor away " is one of the hoariest lines in health -- but there 's plenty of truth to it , spotlighted in a new CSIRO report on the fruit 's many benefits . <p> A CSIRO team reviewed more than 120 studies on apples published in scientific journals between 2010 and 2016 , and determined they 're linked to a reduction in some forms of cancer , including breast cancer , prostate cancer , and colorectal cancer ; and that they also appear to boost cardiovascular health by lowering " bad " LDL cholesterol and improving the elasticity of blood vessels . <p> Another intriguing advantage of apples is their positive impact on your gut microbiome -- the trillions of microscopic bacteria and other critters in your large intestine , which are linked to an increasing array of health benefits . <p> " We know crunching on an apple makes us feel great . What we are now learning is how the compounds in apples , especially polyphenols and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert Dr Joanna McMillan said about the research in a statement . <p> " This new evidence makes it even more important to eat the whole apple , skin and all , to ensure you 're getting all the goodness , because a lot of the antioxidants , fibre and polyphenols are found close to or in the skin . " <p> The CSIRO report -- commissioned by Horticulture Innovation Australia , an industry body of Australia 's horticulture industry -- is published in full here . <p> Apples have dropped in the esteem of the wellness set as the " quit sugar " movement has gathered momentum : The fruit is rich in a type of sugar called fructose , which is unnecessarily demonised because of how it 's processed through the liver and potentially stored there as fat . <p> ( Note that apple juice -- any kind of fruit juice -- is no substitute for a whole apple .

 <h> New method of tanning without the sun brings hope to pale people everywhere <p> Do your so-called friends refer to you as Casper the Pasty Ghost ? Are you tired of insisting that you prefer your skin tone to be labelled " alabaster " rather than " pallid " ? Have you ever been accused of being topless when you 're actually wearing a white T-shirt ? There may be hope for you yet . <p> US researchers have developed a way to increase pigmentation in human skin just like ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation does -- without having to actually expose the skin to that harmful UV radiation . <p> The work , published in the journal Cell , follows a breakthrough in 2006 . Back then , a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital dermatology professor Dr David E. Fisher discovered that a molecule called forskolin could give red-haired mice a sunless tan that protected them from skin cancer . <p> But while forskolin stimulated the production of UV-absorbing pigments when applied to the skin of the ginger mice , it could n't get into human skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times thicker than a mouse 's ) because we 're missing a layer of protective hair . <p> " Human skin is a very good barrier and is a formidable penetration challenge . Therefore other topical approaches just did not work , " said Fisher in a statement . <p> But that challenge was overcome after Fisher 's team collaborated with Dr Nathanael S Gray , a chemist the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . To gloss over the science , they developed a class of molecules better at penetrating and darkening human skin -- which induced " significant darkening " after eight days , then faded away like a normal suntan does . <p> Human skin treated with the new method ( right ) is significantly darker than other methods ( Massachusetts General Hospital ) <p> " We are excited about the possibility of inducing dark pigment production in human skin without a need for either systemic exposure to a drug or UV exposure to the skin , " said Fisher . <p> The team hopes to ultimately develop a skin-darkening cream or lotion that could work with traditional UV-blocking sunscreens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you this summer , or for several summers to come : a lot more work needs to be done before the method is proven useful for actual humans . <p> " We need to conduct safety studies , which are always essential with potential new treatment compounds , and better understand the actions of these agents , " Fisher said . " But it 's possible they may lead to new ways of protecting against UV-induced skin damage and cancer formation . " <h> Previous <p> Today is looking a little wild ? ?

 <p> Depositing someone else 's poo inside your own body sounds ... revolting . But it 's emerging as one of the most powerful ways to treat gut problems , reaffirmed by a new study from the University of Alabama at Birmingham . <p> To understand why faecal transplants are so effective you first need to understand the importance of your gut microbiome , the trillions of bacteria and other microscopic creatures that inhabit your large intestine . <p> Accounting for up to 2kg of your total weight , this gut flora plays a major role in your overall health -- if the different species down there fall out of balance , it can lead to serious intestinal dramas , as well as other problems including weight gain , immune dysfunction and mood disorders . <p> Faecal transplants take a sample of thriving gut flora from the , uh , waste of a healthy person , and pass along its benefits by repatriating it into the innards of an unhealthy person . <p> The University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) team set out to test how well faecal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FMT -- treat recurring infections of a hardy bacterium called Clostridium difficile , aka C. diff . <p> Many people host C. diff without any dramas but problems arise when it 's able to conquer the gut -- say , after you take an antibiotic that wipes out good bacteria and allows bad bacteria to flourish . <p> A C. diff infection has really nasty effects including diarrhoea , fever , inflammation and even death , and antibiotics often are n't great at wiping it out for good . <p> But FMT turns out to treat C. diff infection with a success rate of about 90 percent . Via a tube inserted into the nose and down the throat , the Alabama researchers pumped up to 200g of faecal material in a saline solution ( salty poop -- gross ) into the large intestines of seven C. diff patients . <p> Six months later , " good " bacteria donated via the poo transplant were still fighting the good fight in all the recipients ' intestines . Two years later , they still lingered in two of the recipients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for up to two years demonstrates the potential of using FMT for long-term changes in the composition of the gastrointestinal tract microbe communities , " the Alabama researchers said in their study , published in the Nature journal Biofilms and Microbiomes . <p> The researchers tracked the fates of the donor microbes by developing a method they described as " a personalised microbiome ' fingerprint ' " . <p> The fingerprint could be used to identify disruptions in the gut microbiome that could lead to metabolic diseases like diabetes or obesity , as well as diseases like ulcerative colitis or Parkinson 's disease . <p> " Our microbiome fingerprint method will form the cornerstone of a personalised medicine approach to improve human health by providing an early warning system to detect disruption of the gut microbial community structure , " said University of Alabama professor Dr Casey Morrow in a statement . <p> " This early warning system could be used to signal the use of interventions such as microbe transplants , designed to maintain the gut microbe community structure necessary for efficient metabolic function needed for human health .

 <h> How long do you need to work out for tiptop health ? Less than an hour a week <p> You know you need to exercise to stay healthy ... but sweating away in the gym for hours is often a nauseating prospect . So the good news is it takes less time than you think to score the benefits of exercise . <p> According to Dutch researchers , an hour of resistance training a week is all it takes to protect you from metabolic syndrome -- the umbrella term for the conditions that increase your risk of a heart attack , stroke , diabetes and other maladies . <p> It 's well-established exercise is a shield against metabolic syndrome . But most of that research has focused on aerobic exercise ( what most of us know as cardio ) , so a University team set out to explore the impact of resistance exercise ( aka strength or weight-training ) . <p> For a study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings , the team pored over health data collected from nearly 7500 Americans across a 20-year period . Over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you have if you meet at least three of five factors : excess fat around the abdomen ; high blood pressure ; raised blood fats ; low HDL ( good ) cholesterol ; and elevated blood sugar . <p> The analysis showed those who completed two or more resistance sessions per week had a 17 percent lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome . Doing resistance exercise for even less than an hour a week was linked with a 29 percent lower risk . <p> Those who did more resistance sessions did n't lower their risk any further . It also did n't appear to matter if people spread their training out across the week , or if they only exercised on weekends . <p> " Our results indicate a modest amount of resistance exercise , such as two 30-minute sessions per week , has the most beneficial effect , " said Esm ? e Bakker , a specialist in physical activity epidemiology and the lead author of the study , in a statement . <p> " These findings should be included in the standard medical recommendations for preventing metabolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of exercise : how it makes you feel <p> If the metabolic syndrome thing does n't sell you on exercise , this might : Another new study , published in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise , found a single 30-minute workout leaves women feeling stronger and slimmer . <p> A team from the University of British Columbia recruited almost 60 young women and split them into two groups : one that sat and read , and another that did moderate-intensity cardio for half an hour . Both groups were surveyed on their perceptions of themselves before and after their activities <p> The body image of the exercisers significantly improved -- and not just because exercise had boosted their overall mood , hoisting their body image up with it . Rather , the women 's body image improved because they reported feeling stronger and slimmer . <p> " We think that the feelings of strength and empowerment women achieve post exercise , stimulate an improved internal dialogue , " said the study 's senior author Kathleen Martin Ginis , professor in UBC Okanagan 's School of Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should generate positive thoughts and feelings about their bodies which may replace the all too common negative ones . " <p> Those positive thoughts and feelings persisted for at least 20 minutes after the workouts , a familiar feeling to anyone who 's strutted out of the gym feeling like Beyonce . <p> " We all have those days when we do n't feel great about our bodies , " said Martin Ginis in a statement . " This study and our previous research shows one way to feel better , is to get going and exercise . The effects can be immediate . " 
 <h> Easy on the hot chips -- they could cut years off your life <p> Sometimes studies uncover surprising health benefits of " bad " foods -- like chocolate or white bread . But sometimes studies just reaffirm that bad foods are still pretty bad ... and sadly , hot chips still belong in that group . <p> Italian researchers have determined that two to three portions of fried potatoes a week -- French fries , hash browns , some kinds of potato chips -- is associated with a doubling of the risk of early death . <p> The study is observational , meaning it 's found a link between fried potatoes and early death but does n't prove one directly causes the other . ( It could be that hot chip aficionados share other qualities , perhaps obesity or sedentary lifestyles or high sodium consumption , that might also be responsible for their shortened years . ) <p> But the result is worthy of attention because " fried potatoes consumption is increasing worldwide , " the study 's lead author Dr Nicola Veronese , from Italy 's National Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for potato lovers : spuds themselves were n't linked to an increased likelihood of early death -- those who ate them in un-fried forms were n't any more at risk than those who hardly ate them at all . <p> The humble spud has fallen from grace thanks to the rise of low-carb diets , and because they 're heavy on starch . In January , sports nutritionist Abby Shaw advised Coach potatoes are rich source of nutrients ( especially if you keep their skins on ) and should n't be overlooked . 
 <h> The benefits of active sitting : what happened when I sat on a giant ball at work for a week <p> There 's about 230 working days in a year , once you factor out weekends and public holidays and annual leave . So if you 're an office worker on a standard eight-hour day , you spend something approaching 1800 hours a year ( about 75 days ) in your work chair . <p> That 's pretty damn depressing . Particularly given the quality of a lot of work chairs . <p> With that in mind I trialled Technogym 's Wellness Ball , a futuristic and fearsome-looking sphere designed to promote something called " active sitting " . <p> The idea is that when you sit on the Wellness Ball , you use teeny-tiny stabilisers in your back and your core -- muscles that would be switched off if you sat in a boring old chair -- which builds strength and improves your posture . <p> After my first hour or so on the Wellness Ball I feel those muscles up around my spine singing . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that 's different to my chair ( which often makes my lower back ache if I lose track of time and sit in it too long ) . <p> Another advantage of the Wellness Ball is that it makes one of my bad office habits impossible : I ca n't lean right back with my spine bending at an unpleasant angle like I often do in a chair . ( Although a couple of times I catch myself still hunching forwards . ) <p> And maybe it 's just that sitting on a giant inflatable ball at work is a novelty , but ... the Wellness Ball is kind of fun . Perching atop it is a bit of a game . The double takes from my co-workers as they pass by ( " ... what on earth are you sitting on ? " ) just adds to the entertainment . In the couple of weeks I trial the ball , I often find myself rolling it out around mid-afternoon to break the slump ... and , I 'll admit , bouncing up on down on it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Wellness Ball is n't cheap -- it 'll set you back a few hundred dollars , and you can pick up standard-issue fitness balls for maybe $20 . Those wo n't be as beautifully made , though : the Wellness Ball has a stylish zipper ( ! ) , but also comes with access to a range of online programs and exercise videos . <p> ( One big advantage : unlike most fitness balls , the Wellness Ball is perfectly balanced and does n't roll all over the damn place . When I stand up , it more or less stays exactly where it is . ) <p> The Wellness Ball makes no claim to be a permanent replacement for a chair , but rather an alternative . In an ideal world I 'd ditch the chairs and balls for a standing desk , but those are still a rarity -- in the meantime , the Wellness Ball is a neat solution to the problem of all those hours spent slumped in office chairs . 
 <h> How to become more self-aware -- and why it matters <p> Do you think you 're self-aware ? Here 's something that might freak you out : 95 percent of people think they possess self-awareness , but only around 15 percent of people really do . <p> This statistic comes from American organisational psychologist Tasha Eurich , the author of Insight , a book that explores why being more self-aware can improve our careers , relationships and overall lives -- and how to do it . <p> Eurich came to the above statistic after analysing the data of thousands of people who took an online survey ( you can take it here ) answering questions about how they see themselves and their life . She also had someone close to the respondents complete the quiz about them ( they never saw what the other person said ) . <p> According to Eurich , how closely your answers match that of the other person 's reveal how self-aware you are . Obviously this is somewhat flawed -- a confident-seeming person could be perceived as being sure of themselves by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Eurich admits the quiz only gives a high-level view and should not be seen as an " end all , be all " summation of how self-aware a person is ) . <p> So why is it important to be self-aware ? <p> " When we are self-aware , we 're happier , we make better decisions at work and at home , we raise more mature children , the list goes on , " Eurich told The Verge . <p> " Leaders who are more self-aware even lead more profitable companies . " <p> says this is because if we know ourselves well , we 'll make better decisions . <p> " When we do n't have a clear understanding of who we are , we tend to make choices that are n't in our best interest . <p> " We go for things we 're not going to succeed at , or a path that we 're not suited for . " <p> argues we 're also more likely to have happier , healthier relationships . <p> " When we 're delusional about ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> Why self-awareness matters <p> is n't alone in her argument that improving self-awareness should be a priority . <p> A German study published in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement last month found that being more self-aware also made people more empathetic to others . <p> In the trial , people were taught to identify their " subpersonalities " , such as the " inner manager " or the " inner child " , and the behaviours and emotions that come with them . <p> The researchers found the degree that people improved the ability to self-identify " went hand in hand " with their ability to do the same in others , increasing how much they were able to understand and relate to them -- they could walk in their shoes . <p> It 's hard to argue that improving self-awareness is n't good for us ( unless of course you 'd rather live in ignorant bliss -- there 's an existential question for another day ) . <p> says there are two types of self-awareness : internal and external . <p> Some people will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both , while others might be strong in one and not so much in the other . <p> Meanwhile involves having a good idea of how others perceive us . <p> As Eurich explains , people that lack external self-awareness " are disconnected from how they come across , can unintentionally alienate or offend people , and can sometimes be blindsided by critical feedback . " <h> How to be more self-aware <p> In Insight Eurich shares her wisdom for developing both internal and external self-awareness in-depth , but there are a couple of exercises she recommends to get started , one of which is " the life story exercise " , which involves thinking about your life as if it was a book . <p> " Divide that book into chapters that represent the key phases of your life , " Eurich instructs . <p> " Within those phases , think of five to 10 specific scenes in your story -- high points , low points , turning points , early memories , important childhood events , important adulthood events , or any other event you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , take a step back and look at your life story as a whole : What major themes , feelings , or lessons do you see in your story ?

 <h> Get doodling : How making art makes you feel good <p> Admittedly , it 's a bit of a stretch to describe the stick figures you doodled during that boring work meeting or phone call with Nan as " art " -- but a new pilot study suggests making any kind of art activates the brain 's reward pathways , even if that art is just terrible . <p> Researchers from Drexel University recruited a mix of artists and non-artists and hooked them to headbands that measured blood flow through the brain . These 26 subjects then completed three art activities for three minutes each : colouring in a mandala ( a round symbol used in Buddhism ) ; doodling within or around a circle marked on a paper ; and a free-drawing session . <p> Published in the journal The Arts in Psychotherapy , the study found there was increased blood flow during all three activities to the prefrontal cortex of the brain -- a region linked to the brain 's reward circuitry , suggesting that getting your art on stokes positive feelings . <p> The findings suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more interestingly , that artistic skill and experience does n't seem to impact how rewarding it is to make art . <p> " There might be inherent pleasure in doing art activities independent of the end results , " said study leader Girija Kaimal , which is a polite way of saying " Making art feeds your soul you even if you have the artistic ability of an old sofa dumped in an alley " . <p> Her previous studies also indicated that you feel good after making art regardless of how good you are at it ( so do n't stress if finger-painting pre-schoolers are crafting better masterpieces than you ) . <p> While more research needs to be done to confirm the study 's findings , Kaimal said those who do n't make art could be overlooking " a simple potential source of rewards perceived by the brain " . <p> " This study 's findings ... indicate an inherent potential for evoking positive emotions through art-making -- and doodling especially , " she said in a statement . <p> " Doodling is something we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill independent , judgment-free pleasurable activity . " <p> The study might not surprise those who jumped on board adult colouring-in books back when they were a hot trend -- though Kaimal 's research indicated that more artistic types found colouring-in less enjoyable , perhaps because they felt constrained by the pre-drawn lines . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Download a 50 minute playlist and do n't stop until it stops ! ? ?

 <h> Which is better for you : green or red capsicum ? <p> Red capsicums add a nice pop of colour to any dish , but there 's another reason to choose them over green capsicums next time you 're at the supermarket . <p> Red capsicums ( aka red peppers , red bell peppers or red sweet peppers ) are just green capsicums that have been allowed to fully ripen before being picked , which means they contain a higher amount of valuable nutrients . ( Orange and yellow capsicums are . ) <p> " Green capsicums are harvested before they are fully ripe , whereas red capsicums are more mature and have a much higher carotenoid content , " nutritionist Susie Burrell , founder of weight loss program Shape Me , told Coach . <p> Carotenoids are essentially antioxidants found in brightly coloured vegetables such as squash , carrots and oranges . They fight free radicals , boost the immune system and also have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body . <p> One carotenoid in particular -- beta-carotene -- is used by the body to make vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and skin health among other things . <p> But if you prefer green capsicums over red , or find red capsicums are too expensive , just aim to up your intake of other bright ( and therefore carotenoid-rich ) fruit and vegetables , like carrots , sweet potatoes and tomatoes . <p> " All fresh fruit and vegetables are good for you , " Burrell says . <p> " Green capsicums are still a good source of nutrients and fibre . However , red capsicums tick the superfood box when it comes to vitamin and antioxidant content . " <p> All capsicums , whether red , green , yellow or orange , are packed with vitamin C. <p> A green capsicum has around 95 milligrams of vitamin C , while a red one has 150 milligrams -- in comparison , an orange only has around 50 milligrams of vitamin C , so to boost immunity you 're better off biting into a capsicum than an orange . <p> To maximize the goodness you get from a capsicum , you 're better off eating it with fat in a meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the Linus Pauling Institute at America 's Oregon University . <p> " Chopping , pur ? eing , and cooking carotenoid-containing vegetables in oil generally increase the bioavailability -- the ease of which a nutrient can make its way from food into your body -- of the carotenoids they contain . " <p> That 's right -- even though it 's often thought eating vegetables raw is better since cooking can kill some nutrients , when it comes to certain vegetables cooking them aids the body 's uptake of the good stuff . <p> A 2002 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found cooking carrots increased their level of beta-carotene. 
 <h> Report ranks Australia 's fast food giants by health star rating <p> You 've probably noticed the health stars adorning packets at the supermarket , designed to give you a quick overview of a food 's nutrition value . ( If you have n't noticed them ... pay more attention . ) <p> The ratings system is so effective it should be extended to Australia 's biggest fast food outlets , argue researchers from the Sydney-based George Institute for Global Health -- who 've gone ahead and scored the offerings from the likes of McDonald 's , Pizza Hut and Red Rooster . <p> You might expect Macca 's or KFC to cop the lowest average health star rating , but that honour goes to Gloria Jeans : the caf ? chain scored a mere two stars when all its goods were tallied up . <p> Published in the journal Appetite , the George team 's paper analysed the nutrition content of more than 1500 food items from 13 fast food giants . Shockingly , it turns out fast food is n't so good for you -- the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 stars . <p> But the researchers say shaming fast food is n't the point of health star ratings . Rather , it 's to make healthier items stand out when you 're in a rush and do n't have time to pore over the menu . <p> While big chain restaurants already spell out how many kilojoules their food contains , that information is n't as easy to grasp as a star rating -- and kilojoules only reveal energy content , whereas the health stars reveal nutritional make-up . <p> " We also know that many consumers still struggle with using the kilojoule labelling , whereas the HSR performs really well in terms of consumer understanding , " said the paper 's co-author Dr Elizabeth Dunford in a statement . <p> The report assigned health star rankings to individual food offerings to reveal not only which chain is the healthiest , but which offers the widest range of healthy ( and not so healthy ) foods : <p> Chain <p> Health star rating <p> Percentage of products in each HSR category <p> Gloria Jeans <p> 2.0 <p> 41 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 <p> 13 <p> Muffin Break <p> 2.2 <p> 30 <p> 63 <p> 7 <p> Hungry Jack 's <p> 2.3 <p> 27 <p> 49 <p> 24 <p> Pizza Hut <p> 2.3 <p> 18 <p> 80 <p> KFC <p> 2.5 <p> 32 <p> 28 <p> 40 <p> Domino 's <p> 2.6 <p> 8 <p> 88 <p> 4 <p> McDonald 's <p> 2.6 <p> 18 <p> 57 <p> 25 <p> Coffee Club <p> 2.8 <p> 20 <p> 44 <p> 36 <p> Crust <p> 2.9 <p> 7 <p> 44 <p> 49 <p> Red Rooster <p> 3.2 <p> 6 <p> 47 <p> 47 <p> Oporto <p> 3.4 <p> 20 <p> 78 <p> Subway <p> 3.4 <p> 5 <p> 12 <p> 83 <p> HSR = 0.5-1.5 <p> 2.0-3.0 <p> HSR = 3.5-5 <p> While big chain restaurants already spell out how many kilojoules their food contains , that information is n't as easy to grasp as a star rating -- and kilojoules only reveal energy content , whereas the health stars reveal nutritional make-up . <p> " We also know that many consumers still struggle with using the kilojoule labelling , whereas the HSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the paper 's co-author Dr Elizabeth Dunford in a statement . <p> " When you look at the range of foods in the likes of Muffin Break , McCaf ? and Gloria Jean 's there are a huge amount of energy-dense desserts and sugary drinks , " said Dr Dunford . " Some of the cakes on sale contained in just one serve close to half the energy intake the average Australian needs in a day . " <p> The average daily energy intake is about 8700 kilojoules , FYI . One serve of Muffin Break 's Coconut Slice contains 4070 kJ , whilst Coffee Club 's Meltdown contains 3870 kJ . Dr Dunford and her team believe the health star rating will make the toll of eating these foods clearer . <p> " Consumers are n't stupid -- they know cakes are n't healthy , " she said . " But having a half-star staring down at them might help hammer the point home . " <p> The paper 's co-author Professor Bruce Neal , of the food policy division at the George Institute , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Fast Food , which he dubbed " one of the best-funded and least regulated advertising programs in the world " . <p> " I doubt there is much that would dismay the junk food industry more than to be required to put health star ratings on all its products , " he said . 
 <p> If you had to pick the one superfood to rule them all , olive oil would be a safe bet : a new study has reaffirmed yet another of its many , many ( many ) health benefits . <p> Research conducted by a team from Temple University , Pennsylvania , has determined that extra-virgin olive oil boosts memory and learning ability , and protects against conditions linked to Alzheimer 's disease . <p> From the age of six months , mice were fed either a chow diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or a chow diet without it . ( Mmm , delicious chow . ) At nine and 12 months , the olive oil mice scored significantly better on tests measuring their brainpower , and examining the mice 's brain tissue revealed compelling differences between the two groups . <p> " Brain cells from mice fed diets enriched with extra-virgin olive oil had higher levels of autophagy and reduced levels of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau , " said Pratic ? in a statement . <p> To translate : autophagy ( " self-devouring " ) is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and renewal . The process promotes synaptic integrity -- basically , stronger connections between the neurons in the brain , boosting memory and learning . <p> A reduction in autophagy is believed to mark the beginning of Alzheimer 's disease , because the process clears out intracellular debris and toxins -- like those amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau , both classic markers of Alzheimer 's . <p> Phosphorylated tau , it turns out , is responsible for something called " neurofibrillary tangles " , which are suspected of contributing to the nerve cell dysfunction in the brain . <p> ( That was a fun science lesson ! ) <p> This kind of work on mice is a well-established method of studying Alzheimer 's . The Temple team 's future research will probe whether extra-virgin olive oil can not only prevent the disease , but also stop or reverse it once it 's set in . <h> Why olive oil is so darn good <p> Olive oil , particularly the extra virgin variety , is believed to be primarily responsible for the many health benefits of the Mediterranean diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fruit , vegetables , legumes and grains , and even a daily glass of red wine . <p> " The thinking is that extra-virgin olive oil is better than fruits and vegetables alone , and as a monounsaturated vegetable fat it is healthier than saturated animal fats , " said Dr Pratic ? . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> There 's no elevator to success , you have to take the stairs ? ? and we 're following the lead of our leading lady @ljclarkson .

 <h> Cute animals are the secret to a happy and lasting relationship <p> The keys to a happy relationship include great communication with your significant other , making time for adventures together , and looking at photographs of unspeakably cute bunnies and puppies . ( Sure , okay . ) <p> A team of psychological scientists stumbled into this weird relationship secret while doing research for the US Department of Defense , which had tasked them with finding a way for military couples to stay strong after one of them had been deployed for duty . <p> Knowing that the spark of a long-term relationship can fade even if a couple 's behaviour does n't change day-to-day , the scientists set out to test whether it 's possible to maintain that spark by retraining couple 's thoughts about each other . <p> The research is rooted in a psychological concept called evaluative conditioning , where you alter how much you like or dislike something after you pair it with a positive or negative stimulus . <p> For example , you might have a life-long distaste for tequila sunrises because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave you soon after you turned 18 . <p> Another famous example cited by the researchers is Pavlov 's dogs , who infamously drooled at the sound of a bell -- which they had learned to pair with food , a positive stimulus . <p> Led by Florida State University psychologist Dr James K. McNulty , the researchers recruited 144 couples all aged under 40 and all married for fewer than five years . <p> For six weeks , the couples individually viewed a brief stream of images several times a week : one group saw images of their partner mixed in with pictures of puppies or bunnies ( or another positive stimulus , like the word " wonderful " ) . The other group saw images of their partner mixed in with a neutral stimulus , like a picture of a button , presumably not an adorable one . <p> Learning to mentally associate puppies and bunnies with a loved one proved to have strong benefits . Over the course of the study , published in the journal Psychological Science , the group who saw the cute animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor that predicts the long-term success of a relationship . <p> " I was actually a little surprised that it worked , " McNulty admitted in a statement . <p> His team added an important caveat : forcing your partner to scan through an album of kitties and your selfies wo n't magically make your relationship awesome if you 're a jerk to them the rest of the time . Behaviour in a relationship obviously has a huge impact in a relationship , because it impacts whether your partner 's automatic reactions towards you will be positive or negative . <p> But the research could be used to develop a way for long-distance couples to stay close , or as a tool in marriage counselling . <h> Previous <p> " Can you even do that " he says ? ? ? ?

 <p> This winter it 's likely your typically standoffish cat has slunk up next to you at night to steal your body heat , or you 've invited your dog under the blankets to be your hot water bottle -- but it 's just as likely you 're nauseated by the thought of sharing a bed with your pets . <p> The question of whether you should sleep alongside your cat or dog divides households and civilisations , and a new paper gives ammunition to the " pro " side . <p> Dr Bradley Smith , a Central Queensland University psychologist who specialises in canine cognition , argues in the journal Human Nature that sleeping close to a pet " should be approached as legitimate and socially relevant " form of co-sleeping . <p> According to the paper , the big worries about sleeping alongside pets are hygiene and the spread of disease , that it can disrupt sleep , that it blurs the line between human and animal behaviour , and concerns about , uh , " inappropriate sexual conduct " . <p> But Smith argues that none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding human-animal co-sleeping , its high incidence would suggest that its advantages likely outweigh any disadvantages ... there are likely benefits to continuing the practice , " he writes . <p> However , the paper warns that " an unhealthy level of pathological attachment may ensue " if lonely people cuddle up to their pets at night -- something to mull over if you 're worried about turning into a crazy cat lady or lord one day . <p> Smith concludes that more research is needed into the pros and cons of sharing sleeping quarters with pets <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Every step you take , every move you make ... let the Talia Core 7/8 Tights go with you !

 <h> Your smartphone makes you dumber ... even when it 's switched off <p> If you reeeeeally need to concentrate on something , first take your phone to another room -- and leave it there . That 's the only way to guarantee you can give that task your full attention . <p> That 's according to a University of Texas study which found a nearby smartphone reduces your cognitive capacity , or your brain 's ability to hold and process data at any given time . Which is a dressed-up way of saying " ya phone makes ya dumber " . <p> Participants who took a test of concentration performed significantly worse when there was a phone on the desk next to them -- even if it was on silent , even if it was face down , and even if it was switched off . <p> " It 's not that participants were distracted because they were getting notifications on their phones .

 <h> If you 're an office worker , you probably spend more time sitting every day than pensioners <p> It 's pretty depressing to tally up how much time we all spend sitting down every day -- particularly those of us with deskbound jobs . New Scottish research makes it even more depressing , by finding some office workers spend more time sitting than the oldest pensioners . <p> A University of Edinburgh study published in the Journal of Sports Sciences determined that the average 45 to 54-year-old man fritters away 7.8 hours every weekday on sedentary time , compared to 7.4 hours for the over-75s . <p> Sedentary time includes everything you do while sitting down or reclined : working , eating , reading , watching TV . ( FYI , sedentary is not the same as lazy -- even if you 're in the gym an hour every day , your lifestyle might still be considered sedentary if you spend hours sitting at work and at home . ) <p> The University of Edinburgh research found staring at screens , either computer or TV , accounted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekends those aged 25 to 54 cut their sedentary time to between 5.2 and 5.7 hours a day . <p> " Large parts of the population are dangerously sedentary , something we have underestimated , " said lead researcher Tessa Strain in a statement . <p> " We need to tackle high levels of sedentary time in early and middle age , when patterns may develop . Our findings suggest that changing habits in the workplace could be an appropriate place to start , given how much time we spend sitting there every day . " <p> A separate study out of New Zealand , published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology , identified how often workers should move around to keep down their triglyceride levels -- put simply , the amount of fat circulating in their blood . <p> The research recommends brisk walks for two minutes every half hour as well as a daily 30-minute walk , or some combination of the two -- an amount of exercise that will also lower blood glucose and insulin levels . <p> High blood triglycerides , glucose and insulin are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders that increase your risk of getting type 2 diabetes , chronic kidney disease or having a heart attack or stroke . <p> " We believe there is an important health message here -- the traditional half-hour block of moderate to vigorous activity is important , but so is limiting long periods of sitting by undertaking regular short bouts of activity throughout the day , " said the study 's lead author , University of Otago nutrition expert Dr Meredith Peddie , in a statement . <p> " This approach , if maintained over months or years , may be enough to explain why individuals who regularly break up sedentary time have better cardio-metabolic health outcomes . " <p> In a stern editorial accompanying the research , Peddie warned that the dramatic increase in sedentary time in the last several decades is a product of modern technology that makes it easier than ever to move as little as possible . <p> " Twenty years ago , for many , reading this article would have involved a walk across campus to the medical library , climbing several flights of stairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty volume to the photocopier for copying , and then a return trip made to the office , " she wrote . <p> " Today , we stay firmly seated in our chair , using only the muscles in our index finger to click a button ...

 <h> Your physical strength today predicts your mental strength tomorrow <p> Grip strength has long been used as an indicator of how long you 'll live , but it 's not just your hands that predict your future : Finnish researchers have found that the stronger you are physically overall , the stronger you 'll be mentally in later years . <p> A research team from the University of Eastern Finland studied more than 330 men and women with an average age of 66 , measuring the strength of their grips as well as how well they performed on three tests of lower-body strength ( leg extension , leg flexion and leg press ) and two of upper-body strength ( chest press and seated row ) . <p> Participants were also judged on their cognitive function -- that is , how effectively their brains could receive , store , process and use information . <p> While handgrip strength is a popular benchmark because it 's easy and fast to measure , the Finnish study -- published in the journal European Geriatric Medicine -- could n't find any link between grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength scores were factored in did a positive link between muscle strength and cognitive function emerge . <p> " The findings suggest that it may be justified to go beyond the handgrip and to include the upper and lower body when measuring muscle strength , as this may better reflect the association between muscle strength and cognition , " said the study 's first Heikki Pentik ? inen , a University of Eastern Finland researcher , in a statement . <h> Previous <p> Begin and end each day with self love #selfies ... appreciate your body , celebrate it and be proud ? #thisisactiveliving #lornajane #movenourishbelieve #activeliving 
 <h> Why coffee is n't the miracle weight loss fix you 've been waiting for <p> A new study has found caffeine helped mice drop body weight by suppressing their appetites and increasing the amount of calories they burned -- so brace yourself for a slew of " Coffee burns fat ! " -style headlines . <p> Unfortunately , adding an extra cup of joe to your morning routine is n't likely to get you to that summer body any faster . <p> A paper published in the journal Nature documents how researchers from China 's Huazhong University of Science and Technology fed obese mice caffeine , to illustrate how it affects neural pathways that control energy regulation and metabolism . After they were dosed up with 60mg of caffeine per kilo of bodyweight , the mice ate less and increased how much energy they used . <p> " This is a huge dose , with an equivalent dose in humans likely to lead to severe caffeine toxicity -- if not a fatal cardiac event , " said Dr Ben Desbrow , an associate professor in sports nutrition at Griffith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media Centre ( ASMC ) . <p> So while the study offers a useful insight into the workings of the brain , it does n't suggest caffeine is a useful obesity treatment , at least not for now . <p> " Coffee is basically a seed , consumed largely as a beverage . It can be part of the Mediterranean-style dietary pattern which delivers compounds that have a beneficial influence on a number of metabolic pathways , " Professor Linda Tapsell , a University of Wollongong professor of nutrition and dietetics , told ASMC . <p> " This research adds support to plant based dietary patterns containing foods such as seeds , wholegrains , nuts , vegetables , fruits , in line with national dietary guidelines .

 <h> Think you ca n't get hurt doing yoga ? Think again <p> Yoga is a pastime that 's equal parts challenging and relaxing , and can deliver a tonne of health benefits -- fact . Yoga is safer than any other activity and you ca n't get hurt doing it -- myth . <p> Its injury rate is surprisingly high : one in 10 participants suffer musculoskeletal pain as a result of those asanas ( that 's " poses " , to the uninformed ) . <p> Yoga also 21 percent of existing injuries , according to a University of Sydney study published in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies , which is reportedly the first research of its kind into injuries caused by recreational yoga . <p> " In terms of severity , more than one-third of cases of pain caused by yoga were serious enough to prevent yoga participation and lasted more than three months , " said the study 's lead researcher , Associate Professor Evangelos Pappas , in a statement . <p> " The study found that most ' new ' yoga pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist , hand -- possibly due to downward dog and similar postures that put weight on the upper limbs . " <p> This does n't mean yoga is particularly dangerous -- its injury rate is similar to any other sport or physical activity . Pappas added that almost three-quarters of the 354 participants in the study also reported that their existing pain was improved by practicing yoga . <p> So the takeaway is n't to stop doing yoga -- just to do yoga better . <p> The study noted ego is a key factor in yoga injuries , whereby participants " overexert themselves , take a class that is too advanced or try to attain a position they are not prepared for " , and then wind up getting hurt . <p> " Pain caused by yoga might be prevented by careful performance and participants telling their yoga teachers of injuries they may have prior to participation , as well as informing their healthcare professionals about their yoga practice , " said Pappas . <p> " We recommend that yoga teachers also discuss with their students the risks for injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exacerbate some injuries .

 <p> As previously established here at Coach , any kind of scientific research that demonstrates a benefit to chocolate ( and other vices ) is good scientific research -- a category that includes a new study showing the food of gods makes you smarter . <p> ( Sidenote : " food of gods " is n't merely a colourful nickname for chocolate . One of its primary ingredients is a compound called theobromine -- theo means gods and broma means food , thus , " food of gods " . Fact of the day ! ) <p> A team from the University of L'Aquila reviewed the scientific literature to find out both the immediate and longer-term effects of cocoa flavanols on brainpower -- and , bless their hearts , they uncovered some good stuff . <p> For starters , study participants enhanced their working memory performance and visual information processing after a dose of cocoa flavanols . <p> And while everyone knows a sleepless night does your thinking no favours , the review showed that the cognitive impairment of sleep deprivation can be defeated by eating cocoa the morning after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intriguingly , daily consumption of cocoa flavanols also improved the brain functioning of ageing adults , particularly those with more striking memory impairments . <p> " This result suggests the potential of cocoa flavanols to protect cognition in vulnerable populations over time by improving cognitive performance , " said Valentina Socci and Michele Ferrara , the authors of the study , which is published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition . <p> They speculated that cocoa flavanols are good for cognition because they 're good for the cardiovascular system , which increases blood flow to key parts of the brain . <p> The duo added a caveat to all these chocolate benefits , though , and you can probably already guess what it is : while eating chocolate is linked to brain benefits , eating too much chocolate will also make you put on weight . <p> The " potential side effects of eating cocoa and chocolate ... are generally linked to the caloric value of chocolate , some inherent chemical compounds of the cocoa plant such as caffeine and theobromine , and a variety of additives we add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautioned . <p> To get the most out of your chocolate , you 're best off going dark -- the darker the chocolate , the richer its concentration of cocoa , and therefore the richer its concentration of those valuable flavanols . <p> " Dark chocolate is a rich source of flavanols , " said Socci and Ferrara in a statement . " So we always eat some dark chocolate . Every day . " 
 <h> Gut microbiome 's link to the brain : yes , bacteria in your intestines might influence how you think and feel <p> Down in your large intestine live trillions and trillions of helpful bacteria and other microscopic creatures , collectively known as your gut microbiome . These critters help digest your food , keep you in good health , and -- according to new research -- influence your thoughts . <p> A University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) research team profiled 40 women , taking MRI scans of their brains as they viewed images designed to provoke emotional responses , and also collecting poo samples from all of them ( a gross but necessary step to map the gut microbiome ) . <p> More than three-quarters of the women had more of a bacterium called Bacteroides , and the remainder had more of a bacteria called Prevotella . <p> Bacteroides and Prevotella are the two " enterotypes " -- a very broad way of categorising people based on the composition of their gut bacteria , which appears to be influenced primarily by your diet . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to carbs . ) <p> Intriguingly , there appeared to be a link between the women 's enterotype and the structure of the their brains , and how they reacted to the images . <p> The Bacteroides ladies ' brains were thicker in the frontal cortex and insula , regions involved with complex information processing , and bigger in the hippocampus , which oversees memory processing . <p> All the Prevotella ladies ( put ya hands up ! ) had stronger connections between the emotional , attentional and sensory regions of the brain , and less volume in the hippocampus and other areas . <p> The Prevotella group 's hippocampuses turned out to be less active while they viewed negative images , and they also rated higher levels of anxiety , distress and irritability after looking at such photos . <p> That suggests there 's a connection between the gut and the brain , although it 's not yet clear if gut bacteria influences brain development and activity , or if brain development and activity influences gut bacteria . 
 <h> This probiotic beer could be great for your gut health <p> Everyone 's into boutique beers right now . And everyone 's into gut health right now . So it was only a matter of time before someone crafted a beer designed to boost your gut health . <p> Researchers from the National University of Singapore have created a beer infused with probiotics -- aka beneficial bacteria which take up home alongside the billions of other microscopic good guys living in your large intestine . <p> The invention is the work of fourth-year food science student Chan Mei Zhi Alcine , who noted there are no beers in the market that contain probiotics despite their proven health benefits . <p> " Developing sufficient counts of live probiotics in beer is a challenging feat as beers contain hop acids that prevent the growth and survival of probiotics , " she said in a statement . <p> It took her about nine months to perfect the recipe for the beer , which takes about a month to brew and has an alcohol content of about 3.5 percent . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a probiotic micro-organism , " Chan explained . " It will utilise sugars present in the wort to produce sour-tasting lactic acid , resulting in a beer with sharp and tart flavours . " 
 <p> Exercising is great for building fitness and helping you lose weight , but it 's also proven to boost your mood , slow ageing , and lift your energy levels . Got it ? Keep those benefits in mind next time you 're working out -- it 'll make the ordeal less painful . <p> That 's according to psychologists from Germany 's University of Freiberg , who 've determined that your perception of exercise seems to influence how strenuous you find it . <p> Almost 80 men and women , aged 18 to 32 , were invited into a laboratory and instructed to wear a sleeveless compression shirt made by a " well-known sports brand " . <p> They were then randomly shown short films that either hyped up the benefits of cycling , hyped up the benefits of cycling and wearing the compression shirt , or were designed to arouse no expectations about cycling . <p> Participants then cycled on a stationary bike at a moderate intensity for 30 minutes ( which feels like a long , long , looooong time when you have nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked to rate their level of perceived exertion , or how unpleasant they were finding the whole ordeal . <p> The study , published in PLOS ONE , revealed that the participants who 'd been primed about the benefits of cycling rated the task as less strenuous -- and the more athletic they considered themselves , the stronger this effect was . <p> There 's a catch , though : learning the positive effects of cycling was of no apparent help to those who did n't consider themselves very athletic . <p> But there 's still hope if you consider yourself to have the fitness prowess of a mangled Slinky . The non-athletic participants rated the cycling less strenuous if they 'd been educated about the benefits of the compression shirt . <p> " Merely the belief that the shirt would help assisted the ' ' subjects to have a lower perception of strenuousness during the exercise , " explained the study 's lead author , psychologist Hendrik Mothes , in a statement . <p> On the flip side , the athletic-types did n't benefit much from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting out on your fitness journey , you really are better off investing in pricey activewear ( before slowly evolving into one of those exercise addicts who never wears anything but soiled trackies to the gym ) . <p> believes the study once again proves the power of the placebo effect , wherein your mental expectations of something guide your physical experience of it . <p> " The findings impressively show for all those who do n't consider themselves to be great sportsmen and women , the right product really can make sport more pleasant -- if only you believe in it .

 <p> The 30-year-old has a background in gymnastics , bodybuilding and the armed forces . He 's built up a massive social media following by sharing his fitness strategies and motivation on Facebook and Instagram .

 <h> The three most important diet changes : More fish , more fruit , less soft drink <p> Pros of the Mediterranean diet : it 's really , really good for you . Cons of the Mediterranean diet : there 's a fair few steps to it , which might overwhelm newcomers . However , European researchers have identified the diet 's three most important elements : more fish , more fruit and less soft drinks . <p> Research presented at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) suggests those are the three elements that will give you the best odds of preventing certain types of cancer . <p> " We found that each one of these three choices was associated with a little more than 30 percent reduced odds of a person having an advanced , pre-cancerous colorectal lesion , compared to people who did not eat any of the Mediterranean diet components , " said researcher Dr Naomi Fliss Isakov , from Tel-Aviv Medical Center , in a statement . <p> " Among people who made all three healthy choices the benefit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fliss Isakov 's team reached its conclusion by grilling more than 800 people aged between 40 and 70 on their diets . <p> They were judged to be on the Mediterranean diet if they ate a higher-than-average amount of fruits , vegetables and legumes , nuts and seeds , whole grains , fish and poultry and a high ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids ; and if they consumed less-than-average amounts of red meat , alcohol , and soft drinks . <p> Their diets were then compared to results of their colonoscopies , and specifically whether they had developed intestinal polyps -- a precursor to colorectal cancer linked to a low-fibre diet heavy on red meat , alcohol and high-calorie foods . <p> The study indicated that the more components of the Mediterranean diet you eat , the lower the odds of having advanced colorectal polyps . Further probing revealed that high fish and fruit and low soft drink is the best combo for reducing the likelihood of developing polyps . <p> ESMO spokesperson Dr Dirk Arnold , from Instituto CUF de Oncologia in Lisbon , Portugal , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cancer risk . <p> " However , it remains to be seen whether these results are associated with reduced mortality , and it is also unclear if and when a dietary change would be beneficial , " he concluded . " Despite this lack of information , it makes sense to consider this diet for other health-related reasons also .

 <p> A new traffic light supermarket receipt adds up the total calories , sugar , fat , and salt in your purchases and scores them green for " good " , amber for " so-so " and red for " rethink your food choices ASAP " . <p> A new traffic light supermarket receipt adds up the total calories , sugar , fat , and salt in your purchases and scores them green for " good " , amber for " so-so " and red for " rethink your food choices ASAP " . <p> Intriguing sidenote : Dillin mentioned his results to a German scientist who 'd bred a " mouse " ( scientists do weird stuff ) , which put on even way more weight than a mouse despite eating the same amount . <p> Sense of smell has an established influence on appetite and food intake . People are more sensitive to smells when they 're hungry than after they 've eaten , and those who lose their sense of smell -- because of age , injury , or disease -- often become anorexic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of smell as a quick weight-loss trick , but the research suggests weight loss and weight gain goes beyond how much you eat . <p> " Sensory systems play a role in metabolism .

That would be amazing . " <p> " We think olfactory smell neurons are very important for controlling pleasure of food and if we have a way to modulate this pathway , we might be able to block cravings in these people and help them with managing their food intake , " added fellow researcher C ? line Riera , of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Peek-a-boo ...

 <h> There 's a ' second brain ' in your gut -- and it 's smarter than you think <p> We tend to think of the brain as the control centre of the human body . <p> While that is the case , scientists are making new discoveries about a second , smaller brain in the gut that can function independently of the brain in our skulls . <p> The " second brain " or enteric nervous system ( ENS ) is a network of around half a million nerve cells and neurons ( about the same amount as the brain of an adult cat ) in the gut wall , responsible for controlling the gastrointestinal system . <p> Scientists are confident learning more about it could solve gut health issues like IBS and constipation , and shed more light on the link between the gut and mental health . <h> Meet your second brain <p> Most of us have experienced the feeling of " butterflies " in the tummy when we 're nervous , or our stomach " dropping " upon hearing bad news . <p> But this communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> Not only is the ENS involved with appetite control , signalling to the brain when we 're full , but an emerging area of research suggests the second brain can affect many parts of the " main " or " big " brain , including how it processes thoughts and emotions . <p> Medical professionals have long been aware of the link between anxiety and depression and digestion issues like irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , thinking the former caused the latter . <p> But increasingly it seems to be the other way around , as studies show irritation in the gastrointestinal system can trigger mental changes . <p> " The gut and the brain have a bi-directional relationship ; they are interconnected primarily via the vagus nerve which is able to transfer chemical messages between the two , " explains Coach 's go-to gut health expert , accredited practicing dietitian and founder of Travelling Dietitian Kara Landau . <p> " Poor gut health has been shown to lead to inflammation throughout the body ; and inflammation has been shown to be associated with depression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages of its own separate from the brain , including producing around 90 percent of our mood calming neurotransmitter , serotonin , it is no surprise that having a healthy gut has been shown to be associated with enhanced mood regulation . " <h> The potential to solve gut issues <p> A new study led by the Francis Crick Institute in London mapped the ENS in order to make sense of the complicated system , with the aim of identifying the cause of common gut and digestive issues , like IBS and constipation . <p> " Now that we have a better understanding of how the enteric nervous system is built and works , we can start to look at what happens when things go wrong , particularly during the critical stages of embryo development or early life , " said Reena Lasrado , first author of the paper and researcher at the Crick Institute . <p> " Perhaps mistakes in the blueprint used to build the neural networks of the gut are the basis of common gastrointestinal problems . " <p> Better understanding the ENS is also likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Landau explains . <p> " If this system is defective , correct signaling may be impeded . <p> " This could lead to poorer appetite regulatory hormone signaling between the gut and the brain , and therefore result in increased hunger or a decrease in satiety cues , and therefore overeating or gaining weight . " <h> How to maintain a healthy gut brain <p> The evidence of the connection is still in the early stages , but it 's clear maintaining a healthy gut is crucial for mental wellbeing and overall health . <p> " Ensuring we consume a gut supportive diet , high in probiotic and prebiotic-rich foods and beverages , and low in added sugar and artificial ingredients , is a great place to start . <p> So what should you eat to help your second brain function optimally ? <p> " Fermented foods , probiotic-enhanced products -- that are still live and able to successfully colonise in our gut -- as well as prebiotic dietary fibre rich foods and resistant starch rich foods are all going to be beneficial for overall gut integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resistant starch are chicory root , Jerusalem artichoke , onions and garlic , and green banana flour .

 <h> Mindset workout : How to mentally prepare for life-changing events <p> Everyone knows that after you sign up for a half-marathon or a triathlon , or any other kind of competition or event , you have to prepare yourself physically -- which means training and workouts . But you also have to prepare yourself mentally , which is a far less straightforward task . <p> For advice , Coach turned to three fitness pros who recently took on a physically demanding and potentially life-changing event : the fearsome Australian Ninja Warrior obstacle course . <p> Scott Evennett , a fitness trainer and mindset specialist , believes training to overcome mental blocks is more important than physical training , because if you do n't beat your nerves " you can lose the battle before you even start " . <p> He believe the key to overcoming nerve-wracking events is to take " a small bite of the apple rather than a big mouthful " -- breaking your goal down into small , manageable steps instead of trying to conquer it as a whole . <p> " The first step is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick as you can and try to feel mentally comfortable moving forward , " he tells Coach . <p> , 30 , is a former military commando who completed eight years in the armed forces , which taught him to train for as many specifics as possible -- whether you 're preparing for battle or simply joining a weekend sports league . <p> " The more realistic you can get your training to the environment that you 're going to be in , the better , " he says . " For me on Ninja Warrior , that meant building as many of the obstacles as possible so I could go through them all before attempting the real course . " <p> Jack Wilson is another Ninja contender used to conquering obstacles : the 23-year-old joined the Indigenous Marathon Project in 2013 and competed in the New York Marathon , one of the biggest running races in the world . <p> His advice for overcoming nerves is simple : stay positive . <p> " You 're going to have a lot of negative thoughts coming into your mind -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you have to believe in yourself . Belief is a massive mental strength you need to incorporate into your thinking . " <p> Prior to Ninja Warrior he adopted a strict bedtime ritual of visualising himself standing on the starting line -- facing down not only the obstacles , but the roaring crowd and the bright lights . <p> " If you do that before , by the time you get there , you feel ready ! , " he says . " You feel like , ' I 've been here . ' There 's no nerves because you 've done it in your head a thousand times . " <p> Another to pressure is Ryan Solomon , a freestyle jetskier who competed in the 2015 world tour -- which he tells Coach was " way more " nerve-wracking than Ninja Warrior . <p> A chill-out technique he learned on tour was simply listening to music and reminding himself he 's meant to be having fun . <p> " Focus on what you need to do , without giving yourself anxiety about ' What happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's also the possibility that , despite all your mental and physical preparation , you might not quite conquer your goal -- you might not get the time you hoped for in that marathon , you might 've lost that local footy game , or maybe you splashed out on the first Ninja Warrior obstacle . <p> believes disappointments should be flipped around and looked at as positives . <p> " Every time you do a test you see where your shortfalls are and what you need to work on , " he says . " And every mistake is a lesson learned . " <p> Watch Evennett , Wilson and Solomon put their mindset strategies into action after Australian Ninja Warrior premieres on Nine on Sunday , July 7 , at 7pm . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Found in : Melbourne , Australia ? ?

 <h> The joys of BodyAttack , or , how I learned to love group fitness classes <p> For years I had seen them packing into the group fitness studios at my gym , watched their bodies heaving in near-perfect coordination through the frosted glass doors , heard their manic instructors bellowing at them over insanely fast beats -- the BodyAttack class . <p> Yet I 'd never considered joining them . is all Jane ' 80s aerobics , right ? My preferred workouts are on the gym floor , or high-intensity circuit training , so I figured Attack had nothing to offer me -- and even if it did , I am legendarily unco , so I 'd have no chance picking up the moves . <p> But I could not escape my BodyAttack fate : not long ago an instructor bullied talked me into joining his class in inner-city Sydney on a Sunday morning , and along I went . <p> Turns out I was very wrong about BodyAttack . In the 55-minute session there was a bit of old-school aerobics and high-kicking , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tough my heart 's lawyers drafted an immediate cease-and-desist letter . <p> It was also a lot of fun . <p> According to Steve Cluff , BodyAttack 's head program coach , naysayers often do a fast 180 after actually trying a class . <p> was launched in 1997 by Les Mills International , the fitness giant that basically owns group fitness in Australia and administers other programs including BodyStep , BodyPump and GRIT . <p> Per the company line , Attack is " a high-energy fitness class ... combining athletic movements like running , lunging and jumping with strength exercises such as push-ups and squats . " Research from Penn State University found taking regular Attack classes for six weeks significantly boosted study participants ' aerobic fitness , endurance , strength and power , and cut their body fat . <p> Granted , that research was commissioned by Les Mills -- but if you take even one Attack class and push yourself to your max , those benefits are believable . <p> A post shared by Steve Cluff ( ) on May 16 , 2017 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumbbell racks are mostly likely to snub BodyAttack , and it 's true the class probably wo n't deliver if your only goal is massive gainz . ( That said , I know several guys who teach Attack , and without exception they all have brute legs you could stand pianos on , so . ) <p> But too many gym rats spend all their time on the weights floor -- they end up strong , but not fit or mobile . Attack is a good fix for that problem : it nicely complements traditional strength workouts , and it 's a hell of a lot more enjoyable way to keep your heart strong than going for a monotonous run . <p> " Attack is my cardio , " Cluff says . " I do n't get on a treadmill and schlep around . It 's good fitness , because you 're not just running in a straight line . " <p> has a top-shelf fitness pedigree : the program 's director is Lisa Osborne , described by Cluff as " the queen of BodyAttack " . A ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who choreographs Attack 's moves and chooses the music to match . <p> She believes BodyAttack has endured for two decades because it 's a " complete workout " that 's constantly changing to match the latest fitness trends and research . <p> " BodyAttack is positive , high-energy vibes where all level of fitness and experience are welcome , " she tells Coach . " This class is motivating and the energy from the music , moves and instructors is inspiring . " <p> She says when the program first launched it was solely focused on aerobic movements , but has evolved to incorporate the latest HIIT moves and concepts . <p> " All the strength and conditioning work is high-level industry movements ... A lot of thought goes into every release covering all aspects of fitness to help people function better in daily life . " <p> The big reason I avoided Attack for so long is because , to be honest , I worried I 'd be bad at it . And , to be honest , I was bad in my first class ( ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more honesty , it 's likely you will also be bad at Attack when you first give it a go . <p> But that 's fine . You 'll get better . Even Cluff admits he was " really shit " when he initially took on the class . <p> " I was terrified at first . I was hopeless , " he says . " I did half a class the first time and thought ' I just ca n't do this , I 've got to go ' . But everyone has that . " <p> If your fear of public Attack really is too great , you can do on-demand video classes in your home until you work up the confidence to do it with other people . <p> And you want to do Attack with other people . Doing those high kicks in a full class fulfills every fantasy you 've ever had about starring in an all-singing all-dancing musical . ( That 's your fantasy too , right ? Right ? ) <p> It 's no wonder regulars get addicted , or that Attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " social " ) following of participants who update each other in Facebook groups and follow their favourite instructors around different gyms . <h> What to expect from your first BodyAttack class <p> So you 've decided to try BodyAttack -- great . Grab a friend whose dancing ability and coordination matches yours , dress in comfortable activewear , and wear shoes that can cope with a lot of impact . Because Attack is bodyweight-focused you do n't need to bring anything , aside from a sweat towel and water bottle , or mess around with any equipment <p> " Expect to be moving in different directions : left to right , forward to back , up and down , " Cluff advises , adding that you should listen out for low-impact options if some of the movements are too much at first . <p> " My main advice is : give it five classes , " he says . " The first time you wo n't feel 100 percent comfortable in the room , with the people , with the music , with the movements . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel better , by the fifth you know what 's going on and what to expect . " <p> This is good advice : by my fifth class I could definitely do , or at least do a passable impression of , the more complicated Attack steps ( " complicated " for me is anything that requires me to move my arms and my legs at the same time ) . <p> " really is for everyone -- the fit , the not so fit , the people who 've never exercised , " Cluff says . " Just do half the class if you can at first , but go back because eventually your fitness builds up . <p> " You just have to get over the initial fear of getting in the room . But just get in there and you 'll be looked after and you 'll love it .

 <h> Do n't underestimate Australian Ninja Warrior : Why it 's much harder in real life than it looks on TV <p> You know when you watch the Olympics and you immediately become an expert in every sport , screaming advice from your couch at competitors who 've spent lifetimes training for their discipline ? Ninja Warrior is exactly like that . <p> Watching contenders take on the course from the comfort of your living room , it 's easy to wonder how they could have possibly struggled with such straightforward obstacles -- after all , how hard can it be to swing from some bars and run across a beam ? It 's no more difficult than playing on a giant toy , right ? <p> But I 've stood on the starting line of the Australian Ninja Warrior course , and let me tell you : up close , it 's much bigger , more complicated and more fearsome than it looks on television . <p> " The scale of it is just insane , " agrees Janet Smith , a fitness trainer who braves the course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though some competitors make it look " really easy " , appearances are very deceiving . <p> That sentiment is shared by former NRL player and The Footy Show presenter Beau Ryan , who trained for Australian Ninja Warrior by watching clips of various obstacles on the American version of the show -- which did n't prepare him to tackle them in real life . <p> " Each obstacle on its own can seem fairly simple , " he says . " But you throw so many of them together and when you 're halfway through , your upper body and your legs are screaming at you . " <p> While Ryan is accustomed to performing in front of crowds , TV cameras and lights , he says those elements were new to most of the Ninja competitors -- and for some , that added pressure was their undoing , even if they were at the peak of their fitness . <p> Smith , a Western Australian mum , agrees . <p> " You can stronger than the next person , but controlling that nervous excitement -- with the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff -- can be your comeuppance , " she says . <p> But maybe the most difficult twist is that Ninja competitors are n't allowed to practice the course before attempting it ( they 're only shown a demonstration by a crew member ) , and the fact they only get one shot . If you come off an obstacle , it 's all over . <p> Ryan Solomon <p> " That makes it even harder , " says Ryan . " It does n't matter how fit you are , you still need a bit of luck to get through the course . A foot wrong for just half a second and you 're in the water . " <p> " So much of it is maybe luck or just chance , " agrees Ryan Solomon , a plumber and professional jet skier from Queensland . " The course is not forgiving one bit .

 <h> Relationship builders <p> As their title suggests , RBs mostly use Facebook to connect with people -- liking and commenting on the posts of people in their circles . <p> " They use it as an extension of their real life , with their family and real-life friends , " said the study 's lead author Tony Robinson , whose team identified the four categories by asking Facebook devotees how much they agreed or disagreed with a list of 48 statements . <p> The relationship builders strongly identified with statements like " Facebook helps me to express love to my family and let 's my family express love to me " . Aww . <h> Town criers <p> If you 're in this category , you do n't use Facebook to share photos , anecdotes or every little thought that wanders in your mind . Rather , you use it to " inform everybody about what 's going on " , according to Robinson . <p> Town criers repost news stories , announce events and push out other information , but tend to neglect their own Facebook page -- they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new job , so why bother updating their profile ? <h> Selfies <p> You knew this would be on the list : These are the people who use Facebook " to present an image of themselves , whether it 's accurate or not , " said study co-author Kris Boyle -- they post photos , videos and updates ( like the relationship builders ) with the intention of getting attention ( unlike the relationship builders ) . <p> Selfies are highly likely to agree with statements like " The more ' like ' notification alarms I receive , the more I feel approved by my peers . " <h> Window shoppers <p> These Facebook users are mostly on it to see what other people are doing . " It 's the social-media equivalent of people watching , " said study co-author Clark Callahan . <p> Window shoppers identified with statements like " I can freely look at the Facebook profile of someone I have a crush on and know their interests and relationship status " -- so they 're basically the lurking stalkers of Facebook . <p> Past research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship builders and the selfies , but the Brigham Young team believes they 're the first to zero in on the town criers and the window shoppers . <p> " Nobody had really talked about these users before , but when we thought about it , they both made a lot of sense , " said Robinson . <p> " They 're using it more for kind of more looking outward as opposed to looking inward , " he added to KSL.com . " They 're out giving announcements or looking at what everyone else is doing . " <p> It 's likely you fit into more than one Facebook category -- Boyle noted everyone is a selfie-type user from time to time ( yes you are , admit it ) -- but it 's likely there 's one category that describes you best . <p> The researchers believe their findings could help people to use Facebook more mindfully . <p> " Social media is so ingrained in everything we do right now , " Boyle said in a statement . " And most people do n't think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their habits , that at least creates awareness .

 <h> Why Australian Ninja Warrior 's Jack Wilson wants you to do every workout in budgie smugglers <p> Plenty of Australian Ninja Warriors competitors wear outfits that reveal their bodies -- but possibly no one reveals more than Jack Wilson , who braved the obstacle course in a teeny swimsuit . <p> What made him choose that outfit ? Partly because Ninjas are encouraged to wear costumes . Partly because it 's a memorable way to celebrate his Indigenous heritage . But mostly it 's because he just really , really likes budgie smugglers . <p> " I 'm well known for my Budgy Smugglers . I always wear them , " he tells Coach . " So I thought if I 'm going to compete in Ninja Warrior , I 'm going to make the most of the experience . " <p> Wilson , aka the Deadly Ninja , decided very early on that he 'd tackle Ninja Warrior in his Budgy Smugglers , hoping it ' ' ll encourage the TV audience to " come out of their comfort zones " and perhaps don a pair of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People are very insecure about their bodies , " he says . " And it 's not all seriousness . I want people to have a laugh as well . " <p> The distinctive swimwear is made by Aussie brand Budgy Smuggler ( you can buy a pair of your own here ) , and allows Wilson to make a statement about his Aboriginal background . <p> " I 'm very proud of my culture , and I thought if I 'm going to do it I 'll do it in a way where I 'll make the biggest impact , " he says , adding that the ochre paint on his face and body was also styled after his ancestors ' traditions . <p> The Budgy Smugglers are primed to become Wilson 's trademark , as he says he has no intentions of replacing them with a more conservative outfit -- especially because he successfully made it through the first round of heats wearing them . <p> " I 'm going to encourage people to do every workout in their Budgy Smugglers , " he says .

 <p> They analysed the mother 's intake of free sugars -- which includes sugar added to food as well as natural sugar in things like honey and fruit juice -- in the last trimester of pregnancy . <p> That data was compared to whether their children had tested positive for allergies ( particularly common allergens like dust mites , cats and grass ) and asthma by the time they turned seven . <p> The study , published in the European Respiratory Journal , revealed a strong link between sugar consumption and allergy and allergic asthma ( where the child was diagnosed with asthma and had positive skin tests to allergens ) . <p> The children of mothers who ate the most sugar had a 38 percent increased risk of allergy ( 73 percent for allergy to two or more allergens ) and a 101 percent increased risk for allergic asthma , compared to children of the mothers who ate the least sugar . <p> The researchers cautioned the finding does n't mean sugar is a toxic evil that must be abandoned -- they merely observed an association between high maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the former causes the latter . <p> " We can not say on the basis of these observations that a high intake of sugar by mothers in pregnancy is definitely causing allergy and allergic asthma in their offspring , " said QMUL 's Professor Seif Shaheen , who led the study , in a statement . <p> " However , given the extremely high consumption of sugar in the West , we will certainly be investigating this hypothesis further with some urgency . " <p> He added that , in the meantime , he recommends pregnant women follow current nutrition guidelines and avoid excessive sugar consumption . <p> The researchers speculated that high consumption of a type of sugar called fructose could trigger " a persistent postnatal allergic immune response leading to allergic inflammation in the developing lung " . <p> There did n't appear to be any link between how much sugar the children ate during early childhood and their likelihood of developing allergies or asthma . 
 <p> You do n't have to be an elite athlete to compete in Australian Ninja Warrior -- many contenders are everyday Aussies . But some stand at the peak of fitness , and one of them is Sydney 's Scott Evennett . <p> A former gymnast and military Commando , 31-year-old Evennett now works as a master fitness coach and focuses his own training around several primary elements : increasing his anabolic threshold ( that is , his ability to push his body unbelievably hard ) , his strength , and his agility and mobility . <p> Working on each of them totals up to four hours of training a day . <p> " With my job , I 'm inside a gym or a training facility all day , " says Evennett , who makes his Australian Ninja Warrior debut in the second heat . " So it 's quite easy for me to have all those elements in comparison to the next person who might only train an hour a day . " <p> On a typical day Evennett begins with a warm-up session focused on mobility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its foundation in animal-style movement patterns and is rapidly increasing in popularity . <p> Next Evennett focuses on strength -- both traditional work with a barbell , as well as exercises . <p> " So even though I might do deadlifts or back squats or push-press , I 'll have some gymnastic rings in there or high bar , and calisthenics for my strength work , " he says . <p> Lastly , Evennett works on his anabolic threshold by setting up a high-intense training circuit " of some description " , then doing some interval training to finish . <p> " Easy ! " he concludes with a laugh . <p> Clearly Evennett 's definition of " easy " is different to most people 's ... 
 <p> Inside your large intestine is your gut microbiome : trillions of bacteria and other microbes that contribute to how your body functions and to your good health . Because your microbiome is so important , what you feed it matters -- and new research points to cranberries as a gut health booster . <p> When you eat , you 're not just supplying yourself with energy and nutrients . Much of what you consume ca n't be digested by the human body , but can be used as fuel by your gut bacteria -- these foods are known as prebiotics . <p> ( Probiotics , on the other hand , are beneficial bacteria that you eat to join the community already living inside you . ) <p> " So we 're basically eating for two , " explained University of Massachusetts nutritional microbiologist David Sela in a statement . <p> " These gut bacteria are extremely significant to us , they really are very important , " he said . " Our food makes a difference for us as well as the beneficial microbes that we carry around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology , Sela and his fellow researchers set out to test a compound called xyloglucan , a kind of sugar found in cranberry cell walls that -- like the walls of many plant cells -- is indigestible . <p> " But when we eat cranberries , the xyloglucans make their way into our intestines where beneficial bacteria can break them down into useful molecules and compounds , " said Sela . <p> A purified form of xyloglucan was fed to a bacterium species called bifidobacteria ( found in limited numbers in adults but in very high numbers in newborn breastfed babies ) , which not only feasted on the plant sugar , but also metabolised it in a way that could prove beneficial to the human body . <p> While the implications of this type of metabolism are n't yet clear , Sela suggested that it could have a cascade effect on your microbiome -- feeding good bacteria " nutrients and things that they like " could lead them to " make molecules and compounds that help us , or that help some of the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> The finding could be used to make foods in future , or a new kind of cranberry-based supplement . <p> Sela 's study was supported by Ocean Spray , a major producer of cranberry-based products including juices , sauces and dried fruit . So keep that in mind before you go on a spree ( there are also many other foods known to be good prebiotics -- click here for examples ) . 
 <p> In the short term , a bad night 's sleep wo n't do much worse than leave you feeling groggy and grumpy . But over the long term , bad nights ' sleep can increase your risk of dementia and Alzheimer 's disease , and a new study points to why . <p> " Poor sleep is associated with higher levels of two proteins , " said David M. Holtzman , a neurology professor from Washington University School of Medicine , in a statement . " We think that perhaps chronic poor sleep during middle age may increase the risk of Alzheimer 's later in life . " <p> His study , published in the journal Brain , found that one night of disrupted sleep increases a healthy adult 's levels of a brain protein called amyloid beta , and a week of bad sleep increases another brain protein called tau . <p> The brains of people with Alzheimer 's are dotted with plaques of amyloid beta and tangles of tau , which together damage brain tissue irreversibly . <p> Holtzman and the study 's co-first author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 and 65 into the School of Medicine 's sleep room for a night . <p> Half the participants had their sleep disrupted by a series of beeps that were carefully timed not to fully wake them up , but to knock them out of slow-wave sleep -- the stage of deep sleep when neurons rest and the brain clears out the crud that accumulates during the day . <p> The other half slept free of any interruption , and the next morning all participants underwent a spinal tap to analyse the amyloid beta and tau in their brain and spinal fluid . <p> A month later , they all returned to the lab -- except this time other half of the participants had their sleep disrupted , and the first half were allowed to sleep interruption-free . Again , everyone had a spinal tap the morning after . <p> After comparing the first and second spinal taps , the researchers concluded amyloid beta increases by 10 percent after a single night of disrupted sleep . Tau levels did n't appear to increase in a single night , but participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spinal tap ( as measured by sleep monitors they 'd worn at home ) showed a spike in tau levels . <p> On the bright side , the researchers said these short-term stints of bad sleep are n't likely to do much long-term damage , because a good night 's sleep probably restores amyloid beta and tau levels . <p> " The main concern is people who have chronic sleep problems , " Ju said . " I think that may lead to chronically elevated amyloid levels , which animal studies have shown lead to increased risk of amyloid plaques and Alzheimer 's . " <p> " At this point , we ca n't say whether improving sleep will reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer 's . All we can really say is that bad sleep increases levels of some proteins that are associated with Alzheimer 's disease , " she said . <p> " But a good night 's sleep is something you want to be striving for anyway . " 
 <p> The success of Australian Ninja Warrior is guaranteed to rocket ninja-style training into the mainstream , but the fitness trend has been rising here longer than you might think . <p> According to David Ravi , a Ninja Warrior competitor from Western Australia , there have been small communities quietly building their ninja fitness around the country for years . <p> But except for a handful of backyard obstacle courses , for a long time there was n't really anywhere for these people to come together to work on their diverse skills -- which inspired Ravi to found Perth 's Ninja Academy . <p> " I thought , ' How cool would it be if we had this place where we could all come and train , ' which obviously had a Ninja Warrior-style course as well , " he tells Coach . " It was about wanting to bring people together . " <p> David Ravi takes on Australian Ninja Warrior 's obstacle course <p> The Ninja Academy , which offers parkour , bouldering and gymnastics coaching as well as the obstacle course , has become probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something I was passionate about , so I took a gamble hoping Australian Ninja Warrior would happen someday , " Ravi said . " I had no idea it was coming so soon and I 'm so glad it did . " <p> Like most guys , Ravi started out throwing weights around the gym and " looking at Bodybuilder.com " as a teenager . After growing restless with that , he branched out into " parkour , rock climbing , martial arts , and heaps of other weird stuff " based on his love American Ninja Warrior ( which debuted in 2009 ) and its Japanese progenitor Sasuke ( 1997 ) . <p> According to Ravi , ninja training ( or , to be more specific , " mixed movement and obstacle training " ) sprang from several earlier fitness trends : functional training , which is focused on conditioning the body to everyday life rather than raw muscle or strength and in turn grew out of CrossFit , which in turn was an offshoot from classic bodybuilding . <p> Yet Ravi believes ninja training is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fundamentals of human movement -- it 's based around the things you probably did as a kid in the playground ( like hanging , climbing , jumping , swinging ) that you grew out of as an adult . <p> And when people eventually learn their grown-up lifestyle ( read : sitting at a desk all day ) has " broken " their bodies , they 're drawn to the Ninja Academy and ninja training . <p> Ravi says the benefits of learning to move freely , or rather , relearning to move freely , are as powerful for the mind as they are for the body . <p> " When you run up a wall , there 's a sense of overcoming physical obstacles that transfers into your mental game -- you feel more confident when you get to the top of that wall , " he says . " You do n't get that necessarily from lifting weights . " <p> The other big drawcard of ninja training is the supportive community built up around it , which Ravi believes is rooted in helping everyone learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the fastest . <p> " Ninja Warrior is obviously a competition but to me it 's the best example of competition , " he says . " Yes , you 're competing , but everyone 's supporting each other and it breeds this positive culture -- it 's not ' I want to win and I do n't want him to win ' . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Dips are so great to have in the fridge because they can help to stop you from snacking on things like chocolate and sweets .

 <p> Picture " healthy foods " and your mind likely goes to lush green veggies , organic produce farmed at a beautiful local commune , and eggs so fresh from the chook they 're still warm . <p> What these all have in common is that they could all be described as " natural " -- which new consumer research indicates is a key factor to make a food more appealing . <p> Older people and women are especially likely to focus on a food 's naturalness , according to a review by from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) published in the journal Trends in Food Science and Technology . <p> " It 's notable that all the studies conclude that popularity among a majority of consumers is closely linked to how natural a product is perceived as being , " said Michael Siegrist , an ETH professor of consumer behaviour , in a statement . <p> The research based a food 's " naturalness " on factors such as how it was grown ( ie , organically or locally ) , how it was processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better " by consumers ) and how natural the end product appeared . <p> The ETH researchers noted the popularity of natural foods is something of a paradox in an age where our lives are increasingly artificial and dependent on advanced technology ( iPhones do n't grow on trees , y'know ) . <p> Not surprisingly , those concerned with a food 's naturalness were found to be more likely to also favour organic foods and to hold negative opinions about food science . <p> The study notes that , while everyday shoppers perceive " naturalness " as a positive , " natural " does n't necessarily mean that a food is less risky , healthier or tastier . <p> For example , sugar , salt and fat are all natural , but wo n't do you any favours if you eat too much of them -- so if you see words like " all-natural ingredients " on a food label , do n't be fooled into believing it 's good for you . <p> Natural is what 's known as a " health halo " , which means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a food 's health or calorie value ( other health halos include gluten free , no artificial ingredients and organic ) . <p> " I have clients eating protein balls and drinking smoothies that provide more kilojoules than a burger and fries , " accredited practising dietitian Tania Ferraretto told Coach in 2016 . " While some of the healthier choices provide vitamins and minerals and therefore have nutritional benefit , often the energy or kilojoules content is very high . " <p> Interestingly , the ETH research noted that the preference for natural foods might only apply in highly industrialised countries . Siegrist suggested that in developing countries , heavily processed products may be perceived more positively as they are expensive and thus associated with social prestige . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Dips are so great to have in the fridge because they can help to stop you from snacking on things like chocolate and sweets .

 <h> The secret to happiness is simple : a little bit of generosity <p> Shout your friend a coffee -- according to science , it 'll make you happier . <p> Economists from the University of Zurich have demonstrated that generous acts are the key to triggering a warm glow ( which is an actual term used in behavioural economics and not just gooey sentimentality ) . <p> Their study , published in the journal Nature Communications , suggests that 's because there 's a link between areas of the brain that are activated by generosity and areas involved in processing happiness . <p> The first group was told they 'd receive 25 Swiss francs ( about $34 ) to spend on themselves , and were asked to write down what they 'd buy with their imaginary cash <p> The second group was also told they 'd receive 25 Swiss francs , and asked to write down what they 'd buy with it -- but they were instructed the money was to be spent on someone else 's behalf , like buying them a gift or taking them out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on others were later found to behave more generously in a second part of the experiment , and MRI scans revealed more activity in a particular brain area linked to the subjective feeling of happiness . <p> The conclusion of the study will seem obvious to some but will be life-changing advice to others : altruistically helping out a fellow human , as opposed only looking out for yourself , makes you feel happier . <p> And it 's not like you have to fund all-expenses paid trips to Disneyland for everyone to reap generosity 's benefits , as more generous costs did n't increase the contentment that study participants reported . <p> " You do n't need to become a self-sacrificing martyr to feel happier . Just being a little more generous will suffice , " said researcher Philippe Tobler in a statement . <p> Even merely promising to be generous intensified the connection to brain areas linked with happiness ( although , for maximum happiness , you should definitely follow through on your generous intentions ) . <p> " It is remarkable that intent alone generates a neural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Soyoung Park , a co-author of the study , said the findings raise many interesting questions . <p> " Can communication between these brain regions associated with altruism , decision-making and happiness be trained and strengthened ?

 <h> Quit the ' fat talk ' -- it 's only making you hate your own body <p> An Australian psychologist is urging women to quit " fat talk " -- remarks like " My stomach is too big " or " I hate my thighs " , which seem harmless in isolation but add up to decreased body dissatisfaction . <p> Research carried out by Dr Jacqueline Mills , a psychology lecturer at the Cairnmillar Institute in Victoria , shows that 82 percent of women experience some form of fat talk every day , either comments about their own bodies or someone else 's . <p> Using a smartphone app to survey 135 women aged 18 to 40 revealed that more than a quarter of all social interactions involve some form of fat talk . <p> The other stats revealed by Mills 's research are just as grim . <p> " Seventy-one percent of participants reported making negative comments about their own body or appearance , 70 percent of participants made negative comments about the body or appearance of another person and 49 per cent of participants reported overhearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a statement . <p> " It 's really , really common , " she said . " Other research shows that women believe engaging in fat talk is expected of them and that it 's a social norm to talk in a negative way about your body . " <p> She said fat talk is fuelled by " appearance-based " comparisons -- looking at someone else ( be it a friend , a celebrity or someone on social media ) and judging your looks next to theirs , which spirals down into negative feelings about your own body . 
 <h> The dark side of having a hot husband : it makes you feel pressured to be a thin wife <p> In theory , a hot husband sounds like a great thing to have -- you get to stare at someone really ridiculously good-looking all the time , and show him off in front of envious girlfriends . But in reality it 's not as great as it sounds , according to new psychological research . <p> According to a Florida State University ( FSU ) study women feel more pressure to diet and be thin if they have an attractive husband , if they 're perceived as less attractive than he is . <p> " The results reveal that having a physically attractive husband may have negative consequences for wives , especially if those wives are not particularly attractive , " said Tania Reynolds , doctoral student and co-author of the study , in a statement . <p> The study , published in the journal Body Image , recruited more than 110 young newlywed couples who filled out detailed questionnaires that zeroed in on their eating habits and body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " I feel extremely guilty after eating , " " I like my stomach to be empty , " and " I 'm terrified of gaining weight " . <p> The couples also bravely agreed to pose for full-body photographs , which strangers rated on both facial attractiveness and body attractiveness . ( Eeek . ) <p> The women judged more attractive than their husbands did n't experience extra pressure to diet . Past research by the study 's co-author , FSU Assistant Professor of Psychology Dr Andrea Meltzer , has determined that marriages tend to be more successful and satisfying when the woman is rated as more attractive than the man . <p> The FSU team believes the new finding could reveal factors that predict whether a woman will develop disordered eating or other unhealthy habits . <p> " The research suggests there might be social factors playing a role in women 's disordered eating , " Reynolds said . <p> " It might be helpful to identify women at risk of developing more extreme weight-loss behaviours , which have been linked to other forms of psychological distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfaction with life . " <p> Reynolds added that women tend to overestimate how thin their husbands want them to be . <p> " One way to help these women is for partners to be very reaffirming , reminding them , ' You 're beautiful . I love you at any weight or body type , ' " Reynolds said . <p> " Or perhaps focusing on the ways they are a good romantic partner outside of attractiveness and emphasizing those strengths : ' I really value you because you 're a kind , smart and supportive partner . ' " <p> Future research will determine whether women also feel pressure to diet and be slim when their friends are rated as more attractive than them ... which is a pretty depressing prospect . <p> And here 's the even more depressing kicker : this effect is only true for wives , not for husbands . Men reported low motivation to diet and be slender regardless of how attractive their wives were rated -- call them the Homer Simpsons of the world . 
 <h> One more reason soft drink is bad for you : drinking it with protein makes you put on weight <p> It 's no secret a big , meaty burger washed down with a glass of Coca-Cola is n't great for you -- but new research may have uncovered another reason it 's a particularly bad combination . <p> A study by the US Department of Agriculture indicates that pairing a sugar-sweetened drink ( like Coke ) with a high-protein meal ( like a burger ) starts processes in your body that disrupt energy balance , trigger cravings and pack on fat . <p> " We found that about a third of the additional calories provided by the sugar-sweetened drinks were not expended , fat metabolism was reduced , and it took less energy to metabolise the meals , " explained Dr Shanon Casperson , lead author of the study , which is published in the journal BMC Nutrition . <p> " This decreased metabolic efficiency may ' prime ' the body to store more fat . " <p> Casperson 's team recruited 27 young adults of a healthy weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein content . All the meals had the same amount of fat and worked out to the same amount of calories ( 500 total ) . <p> The study participants then sat in a special chamber called a room calorimeter , which precisely measures how many calories a person burns every minute and what ratio of carbs , fat or protein they 're using for energy . <p> The expierment revealed that adding sugar-sweetened drinks to any meal decreases fat oxidation ( which kick-starts the breakdown of fat molecules ) by 8 percent . The higher the meal 's protein content , the lower the fat oxidation . <p> In a statement , Casperson said she and her team were " surprised " to observe the impact of sugar-sweetened drinks and higher-protein meals . <p> " This combination also increased study subjects ' desire to eat savoury and salty foods for four hours after eating , " she added . ( Which might explain why finishing a plate of hot chips is so easy after that burger and Coke ... ) <p> Experts generally agree that weight management comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in from food equals the energy you put out from physical activity . Tipping the balance will lead to either weight gain ( if energy in exceeds energy out ) or weight loss ( vice-versa ) . <p> However , the USDA research reinforces there 's more to the equation than simply " calories in , calories out " , because the type of calories you consume has a huge impact inside your body . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> Greece is one of the most beautiful places in the world .

 <h> Do women have a disadvantage on Ninja Warrior ? Female competitors weigh in <p> Watch Australian Ninja Warrior and it 's hard not to leap to one conclusion : it looks a lot harder for women than it does for men . <p> Far more women have splashed out before hitting the finish buzzer than men ( with one semifinal left , no woman has yet made it through to the grand final ) , and the course 's obstacles demand extraordinary upper-body strength -- which men are more likely to have than women . <p> That 's not sexist guff . It 's just basic biology that , in terms of muscle power , women are n't as physically strong as men ( in general . Obviously , some individual women are stronger than some individual men ) . <p> " We can train just as much as men can , obviously , and we can get stronger as well , but it 's just harder . " <p> But when Coach asked Hah if that 's a disadvantage for Ninja Warrior 's women , her answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally bigger and stronger than women , Hah believes that extra size can put the fellas at a disadvantage on some obstacles -- citing the Bridge of Blades and the Spinning Log as examples . <p> " They are n't going to move as aggressively for me , who 's 56kg , as for a man who 's 100kg , " she says . " And then even hanging from ropes or poles or bungee cords , there 's less flex and there 's less weight for me to carry . <p> " I think that it evens out . " <p> Janet Smith , who qualified for the third semifinal despite splashing out in the heats , says women may have a disadvantage -- not because of a lack of strength , but a lack of reach . <p> " I found even if I was the same height as one of the guys , their reach would still be that little bit further because they 've got broader shoulders , " she says . " They had that extra one or two inches even if we were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump or reach to are quite far for the girls . " <p> Andrea Hah fails to summit the Warped Wall in the heats <p> Those expanses were perhaps most obvious for Betsy Burnett : at barely 150cm tall , she 's one of Australian Ninja Warrior 's shortest competitors . In both her heat and semifinal she splashed out on a similar obstacle , unable to launch off a trampoline high enough to reach the next handhold . <p> But the F45 Training instructor does n't believe the course should be adjusted for women or shorter competitors . <p> " It 's so hard to say ' it 's unfair , it 's not unfair ' , because everyone 's different , " she told Coach in her Facebook Live interview . " If you start making changes for someone who 's shorter , are you going to make changes for someone else ? You 'd have to start making changes for everyone . <p> " One some of the obstacles your height will be an advantage and on some it will be a disadvantage . " <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly living ?

 <h> The Spinning Log : Why Australian Ninja Warrior contestants most feared this ' deceiving ' obstacle <p> The Australian Ninja Warrior semifinals are already a terrifying prospect -- nine obstacles , making the mere five in the heats look like a piece of cake . But there was one obstacle that competitors especially feared : the Spinning Log . <p> " That was the devil , that thing , " Jack Wilson , aka the Deadly Ninja . " That caught us by surprise how challenging it was . It took a lot of souls -- it 'd still haunt many of them to this day . " <p> " I knew I 'd struggle with that obstacle straight away , " he tells Coach . " I had trained a lot and felt comfortable with my upper-body strength , but you ca n't really prepare for the Spinning Log . Where do you practice for it ? You ca n't just find one in a gym . " <p> Ryan believes he toppled off the Log because he " over-thought " it , rather than going at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside my head , " he says . <p> Six metres long and 22cm wide , the Spinning Log is described by the Ninja Warrior crew as " deceiving " because competitors underestimate how little room they have to move on it . <p> Wilson was one of the few in the third semifinal to make it across , telling Coach it 's an especially tough obstacle because it demands a precise mix of skills that many people overlook : balance , agility and sheer speed . <p> " You could be the fittest guy in the world and able hang for more than five minutes on a bar but when it comes to something so simple like balance that threw off a lot of the competitors , " he says . <p> Your fate on the Spinning Log is determined from the very first nanosecond your foot strikes it . <p> " Your first point of contact has to be pinpoint accuracy in the centre of the log , " he advises . " And you have to be going at a million miles an hour , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ultimately , he credits his success on the Log with luck . <p> " It was my biggest worry on the course , for sure , " he says . <p> The Spinning Log returns to challenge Australian Ninja Warrior 's competitors ( with an added twist of difficulty ) in the grand final on Tuesday , July 25 .

 <h> Struggling to stay active and motivated in winter ? Get a dog <p> If you struggle to stay physically active in the cold depths of winter , a dog could be the perfect motivator to get you up and about . <p> According to research published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , owning a dog reduces time spent sitting every day by an average 30 minutes -- and the effect is especially pronounced in cold , wet weather . <p> A study of more than 3000 English people revealed that , while everyone is less active on shorter , colder or wetter days , dog owners are much less likely to sit around at home in poor conditions . <p> " When we looked at how the amount of physical activity participants undertook each day varied by weather conditions , we were really surprised at the size of the differences between those who walked dogs and the rest of the study participants , " said the University of Cambridge 's Dr Yu-Tzu Wu , the lead author of the paper , in a statement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average more physically active and spent less time sitting on the coldest , wettest , and darkest days than non-dog owners were on long , sunny , and warm summer days , " added Professor Andy Jones from the University of East Anglia , the study 's co-author . <p> Two-thirds of dog owners reported walking their pet at least once a day , making them 20 percent more physically active than those who did n't own a dog . <p> The research team cautioned their finding does n't directly prove dogs make their owners more active -- it could be that being healthy and active simply makes you more likely to own a dog -- and added dogs might not be such great motivators in regions with more extreme weather . <p> The study specifically examined adults aged 49 and 91 , an age group that does n't move enough : less than half are though to meet the recommended target of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week . <p> The results highlight the importance of " extrinsic motivators " to compel you to get active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by something other than our own needs might be a really potent motivator and we need to find ways of tapping into it when designing exercise interventions in the future , " said Jones . 
 <p> Pizza and cake servings have grown the most significantly , increasing by 66 percent in terms of the amount of kilojoules consumed in a sitting . Sausages , cereal bars , processed meat , ice cream and wine were some of the other items that increased in size the most . <p> Susie Burrell , nutritionist and founder of , says getting portion sizes right is crucial for weight loss -- or even just not putting on weight to begin with . <p> " A slightly larger slice of bread , an extra teaspoon or two of oil on the salad or simply eating from a larger plate are just a few of the ways our portions tend to gradually increase over time , as does our weight . " <p> The good news is you can still enjoy your favourite junk foods if you do n't overdo it . <p> " A ' one-off ' dessert or chocolate bar will not result in weight gain , but repeatedly eating more calories on a daily basis from larger portion sizes than you need will . " <h> Portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion sizes and know straight away , when cooking at home or eating out , how much of the food in front of them they should eat . <p> " Aim to fit each meal into one to two fist sizes , and keep protein such as meat the size of your palm , " Burrell says . <p> If looking down at your plate and seeing two fists of food makes you wonder " Where 's the rest ? ! " , the key is to fill up your plate with vegetables , which are low calorie . <p> " Always load your plate half full of vegetables or salad -- an ideal plate is a quarter carbs , a quarter protein and half salad or vegetables .

 <h> Talking to yourself in the third-person could be the simplest way to solve all your problems <p> Feeling overwhelmed by your problems ? There could be a simple fix to soothe your stresses : think about them in the third-person instead of the first-person . <p> " Essentially , we think referring to yourself in the third person leads people to think about themselves more similar to how they think about others , and you can see evidence for this in the brain , " Jason Moser , an associate professor of psychology from Michigan State University ( MSU ) , said in a statement . <p> " That helps people gain a tiny bit of psychological distance from their experiences , which can often be useful for regulating emotions .

A five-minute stint at a game called Sushi Cat proved better at relaxing participants than merely sitting in silence , according to a study published in the journal Human Factors . " We often try to power through the day to get more work finished , which might not be as effective as taking some time to detach for a few minutes . People should plan short breaks to make time for an engaging and enjoyable activity , such as video games , that can help them recharge , " said University of Central Florida doctoral student Michael Rupp.

 <h> How disgusting are kitchen sponges really ? <p> You 've probably seen the TV commercial that claims wiping down your kitchen with a sponge or dish cloth is pretty much the same as using a raw chicken breast . <p> BRB , vomiting . <p> It is true that damp cloths/tea towels are an ideal environment for germs to survive and thrive . Research has found illness-causing bacteria like salmonella , E.coli and staphylococcus are found on 15 to 20 percent of household sponges and cloths . <p> In fact , sponges are such germ-ridden cesspools that experts agree it 's more hygienic not to clean your coffee mug than wipe it with a kitchen sponge ( provided you 're the only person who drinks from your mug ) . <p> The main source of said bacteria are foods of animal origin . One study found salmonella on a cutting board that had been used to cut a turkey 12 daysearlier . <p> Milk and eggs can also have bacteria present in them , but do n't think you can avoid this whole disgusting mess by going vegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although meat is the most common cause . <p> So if kitchen sponges and their ilk are so grubby , why are n't we all constantly i 'll ? They 're among the most frequently touched items in any household . <p> " It 's a gamble -- you have to get the right bacteria in the right food or on your hands , and the right bacteria have to be growing in the sponge at the time you use it , " Dr Charles Gerba , a microbiologist from the University of Arizona , told Coach . <p> " The goal is to keep the odds in your favor . " <p> Getting sick from foodborne bacteria is still quite common , though : there were 4.1 million cases in Australia in 2010 , and Dr Gerba says 80 percent of foodborne illness originate in the home from mishandling foods . <p> Thankfully , it is possible to break up the germ orgy happening on your kitchen sponge right now . <p> A 2014 study in Mexico found the chance of contracting a foodborne illness in the home can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloths in bleach . <p> The study monitored 60 homes over a six-week period , half being a control group that did not change their kitchen habits . <p> The other group soaked sponges/cloths in a bleach solution ( a couple of capfuls per liter of water ) for five minutes , then let them dry on the counter after use -- usually twice a day . <p> Dr Gerba says there are a couple of other ways to sanitize your sponge that have been shown to be almost as effective as soaking it in bleach . <p> " From research , the best options are using a disinfectant cleaner for the kitchen , washing the sponge in the dishwasher , or microwaving it damp for 30 seconds .

 <h> The case against artificial sweeteners is looking worse : they could make you eat more <p> Artificial sweeteners are great in theory : the sweet taste of sugar minus the calories and health side effects . But in practice , artificial sweeteners could have the exact opposite effect . <p> A University of Sydney study is the latest research to cast a shadow on artificial sweeteners ( aka non-nutritive sweeteners or sugar substitutes ) , indicating they could increase calorie consumption -- particularly when paired with a low-carb diet . <p> For the study , published in the journal Cell Metabolism , investigators fed fruit flies diets with varying amounts of carbohydrates and artificial sweeteners ( a common sweetener called sucralose and a less common one called L-glucose ) . <p> " Distorting the perceived energy value of food , by manipulating sweetness through artificial means , has unanticipated consequences in these animal studies , " said lead researcher Greg Neely , a University of Sydney associate professor , in a statement . <p> Neely said a growing body of research makes a " clear " connection between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more studies need to be done investigating their impact on metabolism . <p> That review did n't look into why artificial sweeteners might have this effect ( and it could also be that people with a higher obesity risk are more likely to consume artificially sweetened products , rather than those products directly causing weight gain ) . <p> As usual , it all comes down to the ( boringly sensible ) advice " everything in moderation " : if you 're only cracking open a can of Diet Coke occasionally , you probably do n't have too much to worry about . ( Ditto for a can of real-sugar Coca-Cola . ) <p> " Caution is warranted until the long-term health effects of artificial sweeteners are fully characterised , " said Dr Meghan Azad , lead author of the Canadian review . 
 <p> " For some people , xerostomia , also known as dry mouth , can allow for inadequate removal and overgrowth of odor-producing bacteria , " Leinbach said . <p> " Individuals taking certain medications or multiple medications , those with diabetes , certain autoimmune disorders and those with a history of radiation and/or removal of salivary glands are at higher risk of dry mouth . " <p> Your diet could also be to blame . <p> " Residual odors from foods consumed throughout the day can be retained in the oral cavity , " Leinbach confirmed . <p> " Foods with strong odor such as garlic and onions can be associated with foul smelling breath . <p> " The frequency and type of food consumed may also contribute to acid reflux which may also contribute to halitosis .

 <h> Music vs podcasts : which is better to run to ? <p> For most runners , the right music playlist is as essential as wearing the right shoes . <p> It always has been for me , until recently when I tried listening to a podcast on my evening lap around the park -- and I bloody well loved it . <p> I thought I needed a pounding beat and motivational lyrics ( " His palms are sweaty , knees weak , arms are heavy , there 's vomit on his sweater already ... " ) to push through the breathlessness and thigh-burn , but I found that I was concentrating on the podcast , and barely noticed the discomfort that comes with a sweat session . <p> Now I listen to a podcast for 80 percent of my run , and only switch to a powerful track when I hit the hill at the end . <p> Not only does it make the run go by faster , but knowing I 'm exercising and learning at the same time makes me feel like I 'm generally kicking ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Australian Institute of Sport , distraction can be a useful technique . <p> " This concept -- of focusing on something else -- is known as dissociation , " Dun said . <p> " Dissociation can be effective for steady state exercise such as running , as it tends to reduce perceptions of effort and fatigue , since the runner 's attention is on the podcast they 'll be less aware of the pain and fatigue in their bodies . " <p> Music does n't require as much concentration as a podcast , but there 's no doubt that songs with the right BPM for your workout pace are proven to increase performance . <p> A 2012 review of the research by Brunel University in London described listening to music while exercising as " a type of legal performance-enhancing drug . " <p> " There is good evidence that appropriate music -- something upbeat , rhythmic and with inspiring lyrics -- can improve exercise performance by boosting mood , and reducing perceptions of effort and fatigue , " Dun said . <p> " There may also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to music . " <p> Dun recommends experimenting with both music and podcasts for runs , depending on the pace and length of your workout . <p> " Runners might find that they prefer music for some runs and podcasts for others -- factors to consider might be length , intensity , and pace of the run . <p> " Try both and notice how they influence your ability to go faster or push through pain . <p> " Knowing what you need and when is a useful piece of learning for anyone .

 <h> How to survive a fun run when you hate running <p> If you love running , WTF is wrong with you this article is not for you . It 's for those of us who are not natural runners -- yet who will inevitably someday be called on to join a so-called " fun run " we ca n't think of a decent excuse to weasel out of . <p> Well , I still do n't particularly like running ... which is no fault of Run Melbourne , an terrific and energetic event that traced a spectacular course around the Yarra shoreline and the city 's gardens . <p> It 's just that I 'm not a born runner . So after I signed up for the 10km run ( about the maximum length a giant baby like me can tolerate ) , I wondered how I 'd survive , let alone hit my goal of finishing in under 60 minutes -- which I did , thanks to these strategies . <h> Learn to run <p> Several months out from the race , Lululemon connected me with their ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any running coaching ... and because my technique feels like shoving a couch down the street , I was keen to hear McKinnon 's advice . <p> His teaching method is pretty novel : basically , he watched me jog about 50m several times , each time asking me to consider how my body felt and moved , and how it felt and moved after making minor tweaks . And those tweaks proved incredibly valuable -- my running immediately became lighter and more efficient . <p> While usually I 'd share specifics , Mackinnon correctly pointed out that you ca n't really offer broad running advice that will be helpful to everyone -- because everyone 's running style is flawed in unique ways , so what helps me might not help you . <p> For example , he told me to relax my shoulders and torso , which I hold rigid as a holdover from weight training . Yet he told a fellow runner to tighten up her torso , which she tends to swing all over as a holdover from boxing training . <p> So the takeaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn everything you can . <p> A post shared by the balanced runner . ( ) on Jul 7 , 2017 at 12:49am PDT <h> Make a plan <p> Lululemon also put me in contact with Sophie Ryan , a Melbourne podiatrist and long-distance runner who specialises in drawing up training programs for runners of all levels . <p> I was terrified Ryan would force me onto a strict regimen of several brutal runs per week . But after consulting me about my current fitness and workout program , she drew up a perfectly achievable schedule : two runs during the week ( on Mondays and Wednesdays ) and another on the weekend , some as short as 20 minutes . <p> Ryan also provided some practical nutrition tips for the big run ( simple things like a banana and toast to provide fuel , and no " sugary crap " like energy drinks ) -- another reason it 's a smart idea to seek out experts before you run . <p> Confession : my training for Run Melbourne was not as rigorous as it should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other fitness priorities , and partly owing to winter laziness . ( Look , it 's hard to motivate yourself to lace up your running shoes when it 's freezing outside ) . <p> Fortunately , 10km is not a tough distance to run if you 're already reasonably fit . But any longer than that , and you need to invest time to train . <h> Gear up <p> Lululemon kindly kitted me out for the race , and having new activewear actually is a big motivator to train -- you just want to get out and use it . ( Kind of how you 're always super motivated to finish your novel right after you buy a shiny new laptop . ) <p> Many brands , including Lulu , provide an array of super-fashionable running kit that might surprise you if you have n't updated your fitness wardrobe in a while , so I advise ditching your daggy old gym threads for something new . <p> I also recently acquired an Apple Watch to road test , which proved another huge motivator as the Series 2 watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the 5km mark on the day of Run Melbourne and saw my time was under 25 minutes , I realised I might actually be able to finish the race in under 50 minutes -- giving me a powerful boost to maintain my pace . <h> Choose your tunes <p> Listening to music while exercising is so good that one study described it as " a type of legal performance-enhancing drug " . I can not imagine enduring the grind of a run without music ( or podcasts , if they 're more your thing ) , so take the time to curate a playlist of your favourite upbeat tunes -- as awesome as Adele is , ' Hello ' is more likely to motivate you to cry under a bridge than power through your run . <p> Spotify has a fantastic feature that automatically finds songs matching your running pace ( it 's hidden under the app 's " browse " tab , in the " genres and moods " section ) , but be warned that its musical selections might not always be to your taste . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit snugly in your ears ( mine are JBL 's Under Armour Sport headphones ) . Using cable headphones is just asking for trouble , and I do n't trust Apple 's nifty-looking AirPods not to bounce out of my ears . <h> Treat yo'self <p> There is no greater motivator than food ... at least not for people like me , possessed of the labrador gene that compels us to eat and eat and eat and eat . Post-race I was promised bacon and egg rolls and coffee , and I 'm not joking when I say that picturing them helped me cross the finish line in ( per my Apple Watch ) 49 minutes and seven seconds . <p> More practical rewards , like a massage or a new pair of running shoes to replace the battered pair you 've been training in , will also do the trick . Though maybe not if you 're a glutton like me . <p> Armed with this fresh knowledge of how to survive a fun run , would I do Run Melbourne or a similar event again ? Hell yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not entirely buying the " fun " part ... <h> Previous <p> When it doubt , work it out !

 <h> : Everything you believe about your brain is ( probably ) wrong <p> You might think you 're familiar with the quirks of the brain -- we 're either left-brained or right-brained , classical music increases our ability to reason -- but a recent study has found that our favourite brain facts are false . <p> This kind of alternative fact is called a neuromyth : a pervasive and persistent misunderstanding about the function of the brain and its role in learning . <p> These all-too-common misconceptions happen when brain research is misquoted or misunderstood , or when findings are exaggerated , and oversimplified -- an easy thing to do when dealing with the complexity of the brain . <p> Until this study from Frontiers in Psychology , we 'd only known that neuromyths were pervasive among educators .

 <h> Why your HIIT workouts could be working against you <p> High Intensity Interval Training , or HIIT , is the fitness trend we ca n't get enough of . But personal trainer and yoga teacher to clients such as David Beckahm , Shona Vertue , thinks HIIT could be causing harm to our bodies , and even undoing those hard-won results . <p> " I did a post on Instagram about my training regime and in the comment said I only do HIIT once , max twice per week , so as not to deplete my nervous system , " Vertue told Body+Soul . <p> Comments flooded the post asking her to explain her reasoning . Vertue says , " People are doing HIIT every single day and they do n't realise it 's draining on the nervous system . " <p> " If you 're not taking care of your nervous system you 're going to end up losing all the things you 're working hard for anyway , " Vertue explains . <p> Vertue believes in a Lift + Lengthen + Nourish approach , and created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weighted circuit training and meditation , designed to uplift both your soul and your butt " -- but she understands it 's not as sexy a sell as a straight up HIIT workout . <p> Personal Trainer and founder of Sydney-based female group training program PHAT Fit , James Anderson , agrees that too much HIIT is n't smart training . <p> " I often watch people make the mistake of thinking that if what they 've been doing has been getting them a result , then more of that thing will give them even greater results , " Anderson told Coach . <p> Both Anderson and Vertue believe a varied routine working multiple systems in the body is the best approach to your fitness and overall wellbeing . <p> " HIIT training is amazing when thought of as a tool in a tool belt , but it should n't be the only tool , " says Anderson . <p> While benefits of HIIT include improved cardiovascular performance , an increased metabolic rate post-workout , a high calorie burning power , no need for equipment and a workout in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky . <p> " The potential dangers of HIIT training generally come in the form of three things : fatigue , sickness , and injury , " he says . <p> Doing HITT workouts every single day is a mistake , as it misses out on a key aspect of training : recovery . <p> " If you 're not careful and do n't give your body adequate rest and recovery time between these workouts then your results will quickly diminish and be replaced with tiredness and fatigue , joint pain , muscular strains , and illness , " explains Anderson . <p> Recovery allows your muscles to repair and rebuild , giving you a better workout next time around . " How quickly ( and consistently ) you can continue to recover will be the key factor in whether you continue to get results , or you begin to lose them , " he says . <p> " If you want to build something strong and sturdy then it often requires more than just a hammer , right ? Simply hammering away every workout with only HIIT will quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle " it in a program that 's more suited to you , " says Anderson . <p> Anderson 's favourite way to cycle HIIT into a routine is doing a strength training/weight lifting day , then a HITT day for cardio , followed by a recovery day . <p> Vertue says that weight lifting was a game changer . " Weight training changed my life and body . It shifted physiologically and also my sense of accomplishment , " she told Body+Soul . <p> Strength training focuses on proper technique ( something often overlooked in HIIT when pressed for time ) and building muscle strength and size . <p> Recovery day can include yoga , swimming , stretch and mobility sessions , walking , Tai Chi or meditation . <p> Recovery is also important because it helps reduce stress in the body . " Exercise is just another form of stress on the body , so eventually this chronic stress without recovery will spill over into sickness as your body 's way of forcing rest , " explains Anderson . <p> It 's also a way to reduce those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nervous system . <p> Great workouts -- and recovery -- is also about proper nutrition . " Nutrition is the key ingredient to allow the body to work at high intensities as well as replenishing what was taken , " says Anderson . <p> Variety is key -- you 'll work different systems of your body instead of just focussing on what you enjoy or what you 're good at . <p> " We have a tendency to practice what we 're good at .

It 's an irony that could have quite an impact on children 's health , a new study reveals . <p> New research from University of St George 's London has found that for our little ones , sticking to bedtime is as important as ever : sleep could help prevent the risk of type 2 diabetes . <p> Until this UK study , little research has been conducted into the relationship between sleep duration and type 2 diabetes in childhood . <p> Researchers analysed over 4500 children between ages nine and 10 to discover that children who slept on average just one hour less a night had higher risk factors for type 2 diabetes . <p> Type 2 diabetes is a result of the body being unable to properly regulate the amount of glucose in the blood , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In other words , your body ca n't properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy . <p> Published in Pediatrics , children in the study -- from a variety of ethnic backgrounds -- slept on average 10.5 hours on school nights , with sleep duration ranging between eight to 12 hours . 
 <h> Walnuts could boost your willpower and curb your cravings <p> Eating walnuts can lead us to make other , healthier food choices . Researchers have demonstrated , for the first time , the neurocognitive impact walnuts have on the brain . <p> Walnuts are already considered the healthiest type of nut , promoting everything from heart health and fat metabolism , to diversity of gut bacteria . But a first-of-its-kind study from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) has found walnuts play a vital role in boosting an area of the brain associated with regulating hunger and cravings . <p> The study bolstered previous observations that walnuts promote feelings of fullness , and shed light on its lesser known ability to reduce food cravings by boosting brain activity in an area of the brain involved with control . <p> Lead author Dr Olivia Farr from the BIDMC in Boston , told ScienceDaily : " We know people report feeling fuller after eating walnuts , but it was pretty surprising to see evidence of activity changing in the brain related to food cues , and by extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The study , led by Christos Mantzoros , MD , DSc , PhD hc mult , director of the Human Nutrition Unit at BIDMC and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to observe how consuming walnuts changes activity in the brain . <p> Researchers analysed 10 obese people over two five-day sessions . They lived in BIDMC 's Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) , which provided a controlled environment that kept tabs on the volunteers ' exact nutritional intake ( rather than depend on often unreliable food records -- a drawback to many observational nutrition studies ) . <p> During the first part of the experiment , the study 's participants drank a daily smoothie containing of walnuts -- the serving recommended by the American Diabetes Association . <p> The second session offered a but nutritionally comparable smoothie that tasted exactly the same as the first . <p> The order of the two sessions was random , meaning some participants consumed the walnut smoothies first and others the placebo . Neither volunteers nor researchers knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As per previous studies , when participants consumed the walnut smoothies , they reported feeling less hungry during the week . But brain scans administered on the fifth day gave Farr , Mantzoros and the team a clear picture as to why . <p> During the MRI , they were shown images of ' highly-desirable ' food , like hamburgers and desserts ; neutral objects , like flowers and rocks ; and less desirable produce ; including vegetables . <p> Results revealed that participants who had consumed walnuts showed greater brain activity in the area to do with control , suggesting they were paying more attention to food choices and selecting the less desirable or healthier options over the highly desirable or less healthy options . <p> " This is a powerful measure , " Mantzoros said . " We know there 's no ambiguity in terms of study results . When participants eat walnuts , this part of their brain lights up , and we know that 's connected with what they are telling us about feeling less hungry or more full . " <p> Farr and Mantzoros next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnuts to see whether more nuts will lead to more brain activation or if the effect plateaus after a certain amount .

 <h> Dreamers are at lower risk of developing dementia <p> Good news for dreamers ; a new study suggests people who dream a lot while they sleep are less likely to develop dementia . <p> Sleep is essential for health . It 's critical in managing weight , helps us learn better , bolsters memory retention and the immune system , regulates moods and stress , and can prevent a slew of scary health issues like diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and stroke . <p> And now , the results of a 12-year investigation by US scientists found that rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep in humans was associated with a risk of dementia . <p> Data showed that for every one percent reduction in the amount of REM sleep , a person 's chances of developing dementia increased by nine percent . <p> The link between sleep disturbance and dementia is well established . However , study author Matthew P. Pase , PhD , of Swinburne University of Technology in Australia said , " little is known about the various stages of sleep and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We set out to discover which stages of sleep may be linked to dementia and while we did not find a link with deep sleep , we did with REM sleep , " he said . <p> REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ) is the stage of sleep where dreaming occurs and there is increased brain activity , higher body temperature , quicker pulse and faster breathing . <p> For the study , researchers at Boston University School of Medicine looked at 321 people with an average age of 67 . <p> Researchers collected their sleep cycle data and then followed participants for an average of 12 years , during which 32 people were diagnosed with some form of dementia and of those , 24 were determined to have Alzheimer 's disease . <p> After adjusting for age and sex , researchers found links between both a lower percentage of REM sleep and a longer time to get to the REM sleep stage and a greater risk of dementia . <p> The results were similar after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect dementia risk or sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <p> Other stages of sleep were not associated with an increased dementia risk . <p> " Our findings point to REM sleep as a predictor of dementia , " said Dr Matthew Pase of Boston University Medical School . " The next step will be to determine why lower REM sleep predicts a greater risk of dementia . " <p> " By clarifying the role of sleep in the onset of dementia , the hope is to eventually identify possible ways to intervene so that dementia can be delayed or even prevented .

 <p> These studies , as well as countless others all resulted from research of the Hadza tribe , a community of around 1000 people in Tanzania of which about 200 live an exclusively hunter-gatherer lifestyle , very close to that of our ancestors . <p> The Hadza are a modern people -- they have mobile phones , interact with nearby villages and even carbon trade -- but the combination of their lifestyle and particular location make them unique , and extremely valuable to anthropology and science . <h> Why the Hadza are so valuable for health research <p> Alyssa Crittenden , an Associate Professor from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Nevada has visited the Hadza almost every year since 2004 to study their diet composition , child rearing practices and female reproduction . <p> " Humans have been foraging for 95% of human evolution , but now there are only a handful of foraging populations left on earth , and it will be within our lifetime that there are no more , " Crittenden told Coach . <p> " The Hadza are the only foragers that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be a crucible of human evolution -- they 're living in an ecology that is thought to have represented the ecology of our ancestors . <p> " They have little to no access to medicine , birth control or climate controlled homes , they 're semi-nomadic , they live outside , they live in small tightly knit social groups -- these traits make them really interesting to anthropologists . " <h> What we 've learned from the Hadza <p> Researchers studying the Hadza have made fascinating and crucial findings about human evolution and biology , from sleeping patterns to gut health and beyond . <p> A July 2017 study co-authored by Crittenden posits humans evolved to sleep less as we age in order to protect other family members from threats during the night . <p> After analyzing data collected from watch-like devices worn by 33 Hadza people , it was found there was a total of just 18 minutes in 220 hours of observation when everyone was asleep at once . <p> Since the Hadza sleep in groups of 20 to 30 people , having someone awake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe , reduced the group 's vulnerability . <p> Also thanks to researchers studying the Hadza , major breakthroughs have been made in the understanding of the makeup of cells in the human body , particularly the gut microbiome . <p> Analysis of Hadza stool samples found their gut bacteria is more diverse than that of Western populations , and they have strains of microbes that Westerners do n't . <p> It was discovered that the bacteria Prevotella for instance , which has been linked to improved glucose tolerance , is much more prevalent in the guts of hunter-gatherer societies such as the Hadza than those in western societies . <p> The reduction of Prevotella in gut-bacteria in western populations is thought to partially explain modern epidemics such as diabetes and obesity . <p> Another study published in Science magazine this month reveals the Hadza 's gut microbiome changes with the seasons , depending on what they eat . <p> The Hadza have more varied microbes in the dry season , when more wild game is available , and less variation in the wet season , when their diet consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the human gut microbiome is quite plastic , and can be affected and changed quickly based on dietary intake . <p> The importance of honey in the human diet has also been highlighted by studying the Hadza . <p> According to Crittenden , the Hadza say honey is their favourite food , and they increase their collection and consumption of the energy-dense product during times when meat and plants are more scarce . <p> Crittenden says with the advent of stone tools , early ancestors were able to more easily tear into beehives , giving them a nutritional edge over other species . <p> " We as a discipline have gained so much knowledge from studying Hadza behaviour and diet , " Crittenden said . <p> " As a scientist , working among them and looking at diet composition and how it influences maternal and infants ' health and nutrition has been critical to moving forward my understanding of human evolution . " <p> Why the Hadza are under threat <p> The fact that we 're hearing so much about the Hadza lately is bittersweet -- their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they can before time runs out . <p> Globalisation , population expansion in the region and environmental changes are all reducing the Hadza 's ability to live the way they have traditionally . <p> " Up until very recently , their diet was dominated by wild foods , " Crittenden said . <p> " Over the last decade we 've seen a major increase in terms of traded foods , store bought foods , and foods that have been donated by missionaries and human rights organisations coming into the diet . <p> " The Hadza are trapped in a very small territory that the Tanzanian government has allocated to them in order to continue their hunting and gathering lifestyle , so it 's becoming increasingly difficult for Hadza families to continue their way of life . <p> " They are still foraging for a large portion of their diet , but how much longer they will be able to do so is the question . " <p> Of the approximately 1000 Hadza people , many mostly younger members of the community have transitioned to a nearby village for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of Hadzas living as hunter-gatherers . <p> " There are several human rights organisations , particularly the Dorobo Fund that are working hard to ensure the Hadza who want to continue foraging are able to do so . " <p> Crittenden says the world is on the cusp of a defining moment , anthropologically speaking , as the last of the hunter-gatherers transition to a non-foraging lifestyle . <p> " If we want data on what foragers are doing in terms of diet , behaviour , health and general way of life , we need to get the information and capture their stories now . <p> " It 's heartbreaking to me , in a way , that the lifestyle that characterised 95% of human evolution is on its way out . " <p> She says it 's important not to see the Hadza as fossils or non-modern , but a part of today 's world simply living a lifestyle more in line with our ancestors . <p> " They 're just hunter-gatherers of the 21st century , " Crittenden said . <p> " I think it 's disrespectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> My one weakness .... puppy eyes .

 <p> This latest study focussed on a Mediterranean cohort , finding that four coffee cups a day can be part of a healthy diet in healthy people . <p> " Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages around the world , " said Dr Adela Navarro , a cardiologist at Hospital de Navarra , Spain in a press release . <p> " Previous studies have suggested that drinking coffee might be inversely associated with all-cause mortality but this has not been investigated in a Mediterranean country . " <p> In the past , one study surveyed more than 520,000 people in 10 European countries , making it the largest study to date on coffee and mortality . Researchers found that drinking more coffee could significantly lower a person 's risk of mortality . <p> You might be thinking , ' Hey , what about racial diversity ?

 <h> What women want : New research asked 1000 ladies about sexual pleasure <p> If the female anatomy is a bit of a mystery to you , you 're not alone . Little is understood about the pleasure centre -- the clitoris -- when compared to the rest of human anatomy , but a US study of 1055 women hopes to be part of a modern refocus . <p> The female orgasm has no reproductive necessity ; we can fall pregnant without climaxing during the deed . Similarly , the clitoris is the only known organ to exist solely for pleasure . <p> You 'd think that such fascinating characteristics would see the clitoris a focus of myriad scientific studies , but the reality is it 's had a difficult relationship with academia over the years . <p> Freud 's pet theory viewed clitoral orgasms as infantile and indicative of a failure to mature properly , and Broadly discovered that the 1948 edition of Grey 's Anatomy -- the best known medical textbook in the world -- deleted the clitoris from its pages . And it was n't the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some encapsulate this as a ' fear of the clitoris ' ; that this area 's function as purely for pleasure is threatening . <p> How is this threatening as opposed to impressive , you may wonder ? A woman does n't need to be penetrated in order to orgasm . In other words : we do n't need a man to have a good time . <p> However this institutionalised and socialised taboo persisted , the result is that the clitoris is still largely misunderstood -- by everyone , even those who have one . <p> A recent study from Indiana University of 1055 women aged 18 to 94 hoped to she 'd light on the complex nature of clitoral pleasure . <h> What felt good to the 1055 women ? <p> The women ( most of whom identified as heterosexual , and 95 percent in relationships with men ) were asked to fill in an anonymous internet survey . <p> The team looked at the role of the clitoris during climax and intercourse , while also asking women how and where they liked their genitals to be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : location of the touch , how much pressure was used , the shape or style of the motion , and the patterns performed . <p> There was a wonderful range of diversity when it came to what the women liked , but there were also some general trends . <p> Most women preferred light to medium pressure , either directly on the clitoris or in the immediate area , with about one in 10 preferring firm pressure . <p> Regarding the " shape " of the touch , up-and-down , circular , and side-to-side motions were popular picks , but many other modes of enjoyable touch were reported , according to Science of Us , such as pressing , flicking , tapping , and " pushed together like a sandwich . " <p> Unsurprisingly , there was considerable variation in the patterns women liked , with 13 of the 15 different choices described given the green light by most women . <p> Those patterns included : touching in a rhythmic motion ( enjoyed by 81.7 percent of women polled ) ; a circular motion around the clitoris ( 78.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent ) ; switching between intense and less intense motions ( 75.8 percent ) ; and prolonging pleasure by slowing down and not taking the quickest route to orgasm ( 73.6 percent ) . <p> There were other notable aspects to improving the quality of orgasm , like spending time on the build-up , increased emotional intimacy , having a partner who knows what they like , and not feeling rushed . <p> It also might interest people to know that fewer than one in five women reported that " sex that lasts a long time " leads to better orgasms . Quality over quantity . <p> And how do women fare during intercourse without clitoral stimulation ? Just 18.4 percent of women reported that intercourse alone was enough to bring them to orgasm . <p> On the other hand , nearly three-quarters of women said adding clitoral stimulation to penetration was either necessary for orgasm or made their orgasms feel better . <p> To make that clear : three out of four women desire clitoral stimulation during sex . <p> Twenty-one of the women surveyed could not answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clitoris during intercourse . <p> Moral of the story : while it may not serve a biological function , do n't be afraid of or neglect this mysterious and wonderful part of a woman 's anatomy . It 's better for everyone if you do n't . <p> The study , " Women 's Sexual Experience With Genital Touching , Sexual Pleasure , and Orgasm : Results From a U.S. Probability Sample of Women Ages 18 to 94 , " was published in the Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> For the ladies asking me why I always wear white shoes is because I have an very serious about cleaning ? ?

 <h> I tried Taylor Swift 's favourite workout and it was seriously tough <p> In the lyrics of her much-analysed new revenge single " Look What You Made Me Do " , Taylor Swift sings that she " got harder in the nick of the time " . <p> If you think she means she had to toughen up after intense feuds with Kanye West and Katy Perry , or her break-ups with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston , sorry , but you 're wrong -- it turns out she 's talking about her ripped body . <p> I know this because as I write I can still feel the burn in my thighs from a class at Body By Simone , Taylor 's favourite workout -- she 's regularly seen arriving at the studio 's non-descript building in Chelsea on Manhattan 's lower west side . <p> When I showed up for my first session recently , the hour-long Full Body class , I recognised the fa ? ade from paparazzi photos of Taylor , but sadly there was n't a black SUV parked out the front to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There were , however , two young women in the class that could easily blend in to Swift 's squad -- leggy , high types I 'm pretty sure I heard congratulate each other on getting picked for this year 's Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show . <p> I could have felt intimidated , but there were plenty of non-model looking gals like myself in the bright , mirrored studio , and a quote on the wall put any nerves at ease : <p> " Nobody cares if you ca n't dance well . Just get up and dance . Great dancers are great because of their passion . " <p> I 'm not sure that 's 100% correct , but it was enough to stop me feigning an emergency and fleeing the studio . <p> Body By Simone was founded by Australian Simone De La Rue , a personal trainer and former Broadway dancer . <p> Many A-listers including Reese Witherspoon , Naomi Watts and Chrissy Teigen swear by her technique , and shortly after a buzzing , smiling instructor greeted the class and pressed play on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Body class is best described as a mash-up of Body Attack and Pilates . <p> It started off with a high-energy track to warm up -- lots of jumping jacks , kicking our heels to our butts and moving forward and back across the room as a group . <p> As a generally uncoordinated person I struggled to follow the footsteps , but remembering that inspiring quote on the wall , I just focused on moving to get my blood pumping without obsessing over getting my feet right . <p> Another track involved wearing wrist weights to do overhead shoulder presses , arm circles , dumbbell rows ( without dumbbells ) and tricep moves . At first it felt easier not having to hold onto weights , but by the end my biceps were jelly . <p> After a few more Body Attack-style sets , during which Kanye West 's " Power " came on -- Taylor would not approve -- the last couple of tracks were Pilates-focused . <p> Getting down on our mats , we did three excruciating rounds of leg lifts on each side before finishing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a ball between our knees for bridge squeezes , then placed it between our feet and kept our legs high in the air and reached towards it . <p> When a second Kanye track , " Gold Digger " started blaring , I was glad Taylor was n't there to suffer that awkwardness -- as if the workout is n't hard enough already ! <p> At the end of the hour I was sweaty and puffed from the cardio , and my arm , core , thigh and butt muscles ached like they had n't in a long time . <p> Taylor would have loved it , except for the Kanye West soundtrack -- I think it 's safe to assume she probably brings her own enemy-free playlist to class . <h> Previous <h> Next <p> For the ladies asking me why I always wear white shoes is because I have an very serious about cleaning ? ?

 <p> Since the 1960s , we 've been led to believe that fats were public enemy #1 , and it 's been a hard belief to shake . The logic was seemingly simple : eating fat made us fat . <p> " Low fat " was in and food manufacturers scrambled to create diet varieties of their products -- even if that meant they had to spike the sugar content to retain flavour and mouth feel . <p> However , Western societies were getting sicker and fatter despite following dietary guidelines recommending low-fat , high-carbohydrate diets . <p> Fat being " unhealthy " is one of the most persistent food myths of modern society , and the disregard of mounting scientific evidence proving its ' innocence ' led many to label the war on fat a ' sugar conspiracy ' . <p> A new , huge international study of more than 135,000 people from 18 countries is a big step in paving the way for staunchly held negative beliefs about fat to dissipate . <p> Contrary to popular belief , consuming a higher amount of fat ( about 35 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower risk of death compared to lower intakes . <p> However , a diet high in carbohydrates ( of more than 60 percent of your total day 's energy ) is related to higher mortality . <p> " For the first time , our study provides a global look at the realities of people 's diets in many countries and gives a clearer picture of people 's fat and carbohydrate intake , " said lead author Dr Mahshid Dehghan , of McMaster University in Canada . <p> " Global dietary guidelines should be reconsidered in light of these findings . " <h> The study and results <p> Researchers followed 135,335 people from 18 low-income , middle-income and high-income countries . The study asked people about their diet and followed them for an average of seven and half years . <p> Regions included the Middle East , South America , Africa , China , North America , Europe , and South Asia to look at the links between diet , cardiovascular disease and death -- making it the most diverse study to date . <p> The research found that fats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption was associated with lower mortality . <p> Specifically : diets with high total fat intake ( 35.3 percent of dietary energy from fat ) were associated with a 23 percent lower risk of premature death , compared with low fat diets ( around 11 percent ) . <p> This was across the board for all major types of fats ( saturated , polyunsaturated and mono-unsaturated ) , with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk -- the opposite of conventional understanding . <p> Total fat and individual types of fat also were n't associated with risk of heart attacks or an early death due to cardiovascular disease . <p> While this might be surprising to some , the PURE results are in line with several observational studies and randomised controlled trials conducted in western countries during the last two decades . <p> On the flip side , PURE found that high carb diets were associated with a significant increase in the risk of premature death . <p> And high carb diets were the most common among participants . On average , globally , people 's diets consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 77 percent ) were associated with a 28 percent higher risk of an early death , compared with low carbohydrate diets ( 46 percent ) . <p> Rates of major cardiovascular events remained similar for low and high carbohydrate diets . <p> But do n't think that means drastically reducing your carb intake . <p> " Despite there being no association between low carbohydrate intake and health outcomes , this does not provide support for very low carbohydrate diets -- less than 50 percent energy , " explained Dehghan . <p> " A certain amount of carbohydrate is necessary to meet energy demands during physical activity and so moderate intakes , of around 50-55 percent of energy , are likely to be more appropriate than either very high or very low carbohydrate intakes . " She said . <p> It is important to note a limitation of the study , warned Professor Jim Mann , Director at Edgar Diabetes and Obesity Research at the University of Otago . <p> " There is no distinction between carbohydrates which have been repeatedly shown to be detrimental to health ( e.g. free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which have been clearly shown to have health benefits ( e.g. fibre-rich wholegrains , legumes , vegetables and fruits ) , " said Mann . <p> In fact , a second study from PURE found consuming three to four servings of fruits , vegetables and legumes is linked to the lowest risk of death . <h> So what should we eat ? <p> If you 've been left wondering what to have for your next meal , experts provide some clarity . <p> Professor John Funder , a Distinguished Scientist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research and a Professor in the Department of Medicine at Monash University said not to fear the fat . <p> " Fats ... are not the no-no we have all been brought up to believe in the context of high carbohydrate diets when the source of the latter is refined sources such as sugar , rice etc . " <p> " Go for dairy , olive oil and even the occasional wagyu beef burger , have lots of grains , fruit and vegetables , and lay off the sweet stuff -- especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft drinks . " <p> Professor Grant Schofield , director of Human Potential Centre at Auckland University of Technology ( AUT ) is of a similar mind . <p> " PURE tells us , along with mounting other evidence , that it is finally time to move on from banishing dietary fat , including saturated fat . " <p> " I 'd concentrate on getting people to eat less highly processed and refined foods , especially sugar and highly refined carbohydrates . <p> " The totality of the evidence says to ' eat foods low in human interference ' . If our food was clearly recently alive in nature , that 's a good start to a healthy diet . " <p> Cardiovascular disease is a global epidemic , with 80% of the burden of disease in low-income and middle-income countries . Diet is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases . <h> Previous <p> I was supposed to be at this seasons asparagus launch at right now , but life had other plans for me . ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it in a delish BBQ Chicken Brunch Bowl I shot for this morning ? ? ? ?

" <h> For healthy acai bowls and chia puddings , make them at home <p> Going DIY means you 're in control of the ingredients , calories and nutritional profile -- not to mention it 'll be a lot cheaper , and make for great fodder . <p> " With both chia seed puddings and acai bowls , make sure you incorporate a variety of ingredients that are able to provide protein , healthy fats , prebiotic fibres , probiotics , and additional micronutrients , " Landau says . <p> " As an example you can make both your chia seed pudding or acai bowls with a probiotic water or kefir , and enhance the protein of the final dish by blending in some greek yoghurt , skyr or quark . <p> " Add in some healthy fats via some nut butter or hemp seeds , boost the prebiotic fibre by adding a teaspoon of green banana flour , and boost the micronutrients by adding in ingredients such as berries or cacao nibs . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein , prebiotic fibre , healthy fats , and slow release carbohydrates , as well as the gut healthy nutrients such as probiotics and resistant starch that it would provide .

 <h> Think you have a gluten intolerance ? Probably not <p> Not so long ago , few of us had ever heard of gluten -- a protein found in wheat , rye , barley and oats . Now , half the products on supermarket shelves and cafe menus proudly boast they 're gluten-free . <p> That 's great for people with coeliac disease , a condition thought to affect one in 70 Australians : gluten shifts their immune systems into mode that damages the lining of their small intestines , leading to a long list of serious health problems . <p> But gluten 's increased visibility has also given rise to a number of people who believe they have a gluten intolerance ( aka non-coeliac gluten or wheat sensitivity , to use the medical terminology ) , claiming that banishing it from their diets has greatly improved their health . <p> If you work in an office , have attended a barbecue , or have simply been around humans at any point in the last several years , you 've almost certainly encountered one of these people ( no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they quit bread ) . <p> But new Australian research indicates gluten sensitivity is far rarer than it appears . According to a University of Newcastle study published in the Australian Medical Journal , just 16 percent of those who self-report gluten or wheat sensitivity actually show reproducible symptoms when tested scientifically . <p> Symptoms commonly attributed to gluten intolerance ( including bloating , diarrhoea and lethargy ) might actually be caused by something else , such as intolerance to FODMAPs -- a kind of fibre found in many foods that also contain gluten . <h> Previous <p> ?

 <p> " For example , instead of a salad sandwich on white bread go for a salad containing legumes -- lentils , chickpeas or beans -- and dairy , which are nutrient-dense sources of carb that break down slowly , providing a more sustained release of energy . <p> " These foods are also a good source of protein , which will keep you fuller for longer . " <p> For a hunger-fighting balance of carb , protein and fibre , Flint suggests adding lentils , chickpeas or beans to a salad , and avocado , nuts and seeds to boost healthy fats . <h> Fill up on vegetables <p> Low-calorie , nutritious and still delicious vegetables are a person 's friend . <p> " Low-calorie foods like raw veggies or berries provide the body with essential vitamins and minerals and help maintain a healthy weight , " Flint explains . <p> Eating vegetables at breakfast is a good opportunity to feel more satiated , and avoid feeling so ravenous by mid-morning that you grab a piece of banana bread ( or as we prefer to call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of poached eggs with tomato , spinach and beans provides a more sustained release of energy than a bowl of cereal , " Flint says . <p> " If you 're strapped for time before work , a smoothie with milk , banana , spinach leaves , avocado , rolled oats and chia seeds is a quick and nutritious option .

 <h> Ketogenic diet : It has big upsides , but big downsides too <p> The ketogenic diet is n't just a dumb fad ( lookin ' at you , juice cleanse ) : science suggests it has real health benefits , but there 's important things you need to know before you join the eating trend . <p> The ketogenic diet , aka keto , basically involves eating very high amounts of fat , low amounts of protein , and very low amounts of carbohydrates . This makes the liver to produce " ketones " to fuel your body in place of glucose ( which would usually be provided from carbs ) , a state called ketosis . <p> When you 're in ketosis you burn more body fat for energy , which is great for weight loss . But two new US studies published in the journal Cell Metabolism explore other benefits of the diet : it improves memory and extends lifespan , at least in mice . <p> Jon Ramsey , a University of California Davis nutrition professor who co-authored the lifespan paper , said he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Eric Verdin , senior author of the memory paper , described his team 's results as " really remarkable " . <p> Which is the kind of commentary that makes you want to immediately Google " How to start a ketogenic diet today " -- but not so fast . While going keto does have upsides ( and ardent defenders of those upsides ) , it 's no magic bullet . <p> " Should people start ketogenic diets ? Answer : not unless there is a medical indication to do so and under the guidance of an accredited practising dietitian who can ensure nutritional adequacy , " said Professor Helen Truby , from Monash University 's Department of Nutrition , Dietetics and Food , in a statement to the Australian Science Media Centre . <p> She cautioned there 's not yet a lot of scientific evidence supporting the ketogenic diet 's benefits for humans , explaining that the lack of long-term studies ( over a period of more than two years ) is mostly because adhering to its requirements is really hard . <p> Truby said the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- roughly equivalent to the amount in two slices of bread . <p> This kind of strict dietary restriction opens you up to a nutrient deficiency . <p> " Perhaps unsurprisingly , it 's difficult to obtain all of the essential vitamins , minerals and dietary fibres from a ketogenic diet , and supplements are therefore required , " Barclay said . <p> Earlier in 2017 , sports scientist Ben Greenfield -- a keto advocate -- conceded to Coach that the diet can be rough on your social life . " Going out for dinner or to a wedding or somebody 's house for dinner is very difficult , " he said . <p> But you might not need to go on a ketogenic diet to gain its weight loss , brain or lifespan benefits . <h> Previous <p> ? ? ? ? progress using my #bbg program ? ?

 <h> The truth about sugar ( it 's not as complicated as you 've been led to believe ) <p> It 's the best of times ( for sugar haters ) and the worst of times ( for sugar lovers ) . <p> The wellness set dictates sugar is bad -- as addictive as hard drugs , and even toxic -- and that if you must consume it , it should be in healthier forms such as agave or rice malt syrup . <p> But that perception is n't wholly accurate , according to a panel of nutrition experts who discussed the pros and cons of sugar at the British Science Festival this week . <p> Led by Judy Swift , Associate Professor of Behavioural Nutrition at the University of Nottingham , the panel commenced by clarifying that " sugar " goes way beyond the white powder you sprinkle into your tea and on your breakfast sugar . <p> Table sugar is scientifically known as sucrose , which is a chemical combination of two simple sugars : glucose , your body 's go-to energy fuel ; and fructose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of conflicting information about whether some types of sugar are better or worse than others -- fructose is often singled out as a dietary demon , for example -- but one of the panellists dismissed these claims as " " . <p> While agave and rice malt syrups are spruiked as " healthy " sugars , Mellor said you 're better off spending your money on fresh vegetables instead of a trendy ( and expensive ) wellness fad . <p> " Celebrities are glamorising these exotic ' one-shot ' solutions rather than working on making honest , simple , healthy food more attractive , " he said , reports the Daily Mail . <p> Putting all the blame on sugar for rising rates of obesity , heart disease , diabetes and other maladies wo n't solve those dilemmas , o the panellists . <p> " I do n't find the demonisation of sugar helpful , " Swift said . <p> The panel concluded cutting out sugar is n't a " magic bullet " -- and that it 's just fine provided you eat it in limited quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> " We need to reduce calorie consumption , not just sugar .

 <h> When they 're in a rush ... <p> " I use a third of a cup of dry oats porridge with cow 's milk for rich creaminess -- it feels a little comforting on a cool morning , not to mention it 's high in fibre and keeps me full until mid-morning , " Chryssidis tells Coach . <p> " The addition of fruit adds a little texture and freshness , and it boosts my fibre , vitamin and antioxidant intake . " <p> When the weather warms up , Chryssidis turns down the temperature with some fruit , All-Bran and natural yoghurt . <p> " The yoghurt provides some protein and carbohydrate and a smooth texture , " he says . <p> " It balances the firm and crunchy texture of fruit and All-Bran , which provides fibre , antioxidants , vitamins and slow release carbohydrate .

 <h> Long periods of sitting are killing you -- even if you exercise <p> " I spend too much time sitting down " is just one entry on the long , long , long list of health concerns we 're all burdened by . But standing up and moving every half an hour will undo some of the damage of all that time spent on your butt . <p> Researchers from Columbia University Medical Centre ( CUMC ) make that recommendation off the back of a new paper published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . <p> Their study uncovered a clear link between total sedentary time and an increased risk of early death . But it also found that spending long , uninterrupted stints without moving is just as risky , regardless of how much you exercise . <p> Analysing the physical activity of almost 8000 US adults determined that those with the greatest overall sedentary time , as well as those who frequently remained sedentary for 60 to 90 minutes , almost doubled their risk of early death . <p> " We tend to think of sedentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit around each day , " said the study 's lead investigator Dr Keith Diaz , from CUMC 's Department of Medicine , in a statement . <p> " But previous studies have suggested that sedentary patterns -- whether an individual accrues sedentary time through several short stretches or fewer long stretches of time -- may have an impact on health .

 <h> R U OK Day : If you 're struggling inside , here 's how to reach out <p> Someone struggling on the inside might not always look like they 're struggling . <p> While some living with mental health issues might become withdrawn , or restless , or just not like themselves -- others might not change at all on the outside . <p> It 's distressing to acknowledge there 's no sure-fire way to gauge how friends or family are faring just by looking at them . But it highlights the importance of initiatives like R U OK ? , the suicide prevention charity encouraging Australians to check in with their loved ones . <p> " Seventeen years ago when I was contemplating suicide , no one knew what I was going through , " he tells Coach . " This is why I love the idea of R U OK ? Day , because it gives people the freedom to talk about it and seek help . " <p> Dain Heer <p> Asking someone if they 're okay is a pretty terrifying prospect -- because what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But having that conversation is n't about saying all the right things , or " fixing " someone who 's struggling . According to Heer , you only need to let them know " you 're there for them and to let them know you care " . <p> " It 's so important for people to know that someone is there to listen to them without judgement and to know that they 're there to help if they require it , " he says . <p> R U OK ? ' s website offers this guide on how to start a conversation with someone and talk through all the outcomes . <h> How to seek help <p> Asking others if they 're okay is just half the equation . The other is reaching out for help if you 're finding it harder to cope with what 's going on inside your head . <p> A cruel symptom of many mental health issues is the overwhelming sense you have to battle through by yourself , that no one can help you or understand what you 're going through -- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give in to those thoughts . <p> " It 's important to recognise you 're not alone . There are people in the world who will listen to you and help you , " Heer says . <p> " When we 're in a state of depression , we tend not to see that we 're not alone and do n't realise that we 're actually surrounded by people who care about us , and want to help , " he says . " Find the people in your life who will listen with kindness and without judgement . " <p> Heer adds that simply venting your thoughts out loud can make them easier to bear . <p> " Just talking through what 's going on in your life , to another person , can be so freeing and release the trauma and stress around the situation , " he says . <p> " Another immediate step is to pick up your phone and record everything that 's going on . Sometimes just talking about it can begin the process of release , " he suggests . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on for you and everything you 're confused about . " <p> " Go for a walk or a jog , just get your body moving for at least 20-30 minutes , " Heer says . " That can start to change the physiology of what ' going on and start endorphins running , and you 'll start to actually feel good again . " <p> He believes any of these strategies can put your mind on a more positive track . <p> " All you really need is a change in perspective and the recognition that it does n't have to be this way forever . " <p> R U OK ? Day is on Thursday , September 14 , 2017 . If you need additional support , talk to a GP or health professional . 
 <h> What really causes belly fat -- and how to get rid of it <p> The fat around your stomach always seems to be the hardest lose -- no matter how strict you are with your diet and exercise regimen . <p> According to nutritionist Amelia Phillips , that 's because the cause of belly fat is a little more complicated than just eating too many Tim Tams after dinner . <p> ( That said , those extra Tim Tams are n't doing you any favours : Phillips says sugar and simple carbohydrates , the kind found in refined foods , are more likely to end up stored as fat around the midsection . ) <p> There are hidden factors to blame , including stress ( your body responds to troubled times by stockpiling resources , ie , storing fat ) and sleep deprivation ( which messes up your hormones and your brain 's reward centres , ultimately meaning you eat more than you need ) . <p> And in a grandly cruel twist , body fat can also be caused by too much exercise . ( F--- you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips reveals the best exercises for burning belly fat , and which workouts to avoid .
