I think probably BBC , anyway it took my breath away , I was still realling from the news of his death and this was almost as shocking really ... <p> The colour version shown on the recent BBC doc still had the power to shock me years later <p> " It is better to sit in silence and have people think you 're a fool , then to open your mouth and remove all doubt " <p> It was released in some documentary ( it was called- " Queen Phenomenon " - I suppose ) just a few days after Fred 's death .

He was dead by the time I saw these are the days and by then I was ready for it though it was still a shock and I was naturally upset . The " I still love you " at the end was lump in the throat time . <p> The most incredible thing is Freddie made sure he said final good bye to his audience on record , in person .

Freddie 's sexuality was a subject not for discussion and he effectively hid that in plain sight for his entire career . As a long-term fan , I know this might be hard to believe , but some of us did n't know that Freddie was gay and most of us did n't care <p> The first real insight into the band to my mind was The Magic Years boxed set in 1986 .

' -- ONLY THEN- did any real concern spring to mind when Brian- reluctantly- replied ; ' he 's kicking like a mule ' : -/ <p> And his vocals on Innuendo were so strong that it was hard to believe- anything was really wrong despite Freddie 's appearance on video ( particularly Headlong ) - to my mind he just did n't look ' right ' and his weight-loss was apparent .

Up until then , I personally was grieving for a lost hero , but at the moment the video appeared , Freddie 's appearance was so shocking that his struggle and fate hit home like a sledge-hammer .

That would mean he stopped working in July of 91 . <p> I feel inclined to believe Jim 's word over anything else I 've read about this .

Forgive me , I 'm just thinking out loud ... <p> Late-May had Brian in North America promoting the Innuendo album for a few weeks , probably into June . He was back by mid-June , because that 's when the ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather asked him to do " Driven By You .

Also , why is everyone disregarding Brian 's account of Mother Love ? He said it in 1995 and now in 2011 - Freddie was too tired to do any more and said he 'd come back , but never did . <p> TATTOOL was shot on 30th May 1991 .

Everybody who was there claims he sucked , so it 's hard to imagine why he got the job - there are some rumours that Freddie was " interested " in him .

Or a video would be probably even better : ) Unfortunately I was n't able to get one but I do have a very good reason to believe that the audio recording exists . <p> Approximately 1 hour later Status Quo started their set . They had 3 concerts that day and went directly to Germany ( ? ) after finishing Knebworth . During their set , one of their roadies climbed to the top of the giant Starvision screen with a big cardboard guitar .

When St. John Ambulance crew members finally got to him , he was unfortunately dead . Goldsmith knew about this incident , but he has decided not to tell the band , they were informed later that evening and Freddie was recorded saying " If people have to die because they wan na see us , I 'll never perform live again .

@@6701689 <p> I was reading somewhere on QZ , , , someone asking about when Freddie knew he had HIV ... <p> I can tell you that back in the 1980 's , a lot less was known about HIV than we know about today. - Back then , you did n't get 1 test and that was it , you had AIDS . Doctors were n't sure. - It usually took multiple tests for a doctor to tell you most certainly that you had the HIV virus in your blood. - Up until 1985 , tests had n't been widely available to test for the virus. - Up until then , people generally did n't know they had the virus until they were becoming i 'll and showing serious opportunistic infections. - Doctors generally made an AIDS diagnosis based on the patients helper T-Cell level " or lack of them. - So it was hard for a doctor to tell someone who was n't sick that they had HIV virus " the first tests just were n't that accurate . <p> We will never know exactly when Freddie Mercury first discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , some of us have friends who know things about people , and some of those people 's medical records can be accessed years later ... So I will tell you a little story ; ) <p> Did Freddie know he had- HIV 1984 ? Most probably not ... <p> In 1984 there was a test in the primary stages of deployment called the ELISA test &amp; it was being developed to screen out HIV from the blood supply . It was highly sensitive , and very nonspecific , which means it gave a positive result easily even when , in some cases , there is actually no HIV present . It is very unlikely the Freddie 's GP would have a offered up his blood to the testing labs in Paris . So , based on the fact that Freddie was still healthy and had n't changed any of his behaviour by 1984 , I do n't think he had any- real- inkling- that he was infected . <p> 1985 -- - Looking at the events - this was the year alarm bells started to ring for Freddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test had become more accessible and available for doctors in the UK ( and the rest of Western Europe ) to test their patients for the possibility of HIV turning up in their blood . Freddie was still healthy at this time , or at least he was not showing serious opportunistic infections . But he may very well have had some of the tell-tail signs of HIV infection that doctors in the mid-80 's began to recognize as precursors for a person who had the virus , but who had not yet developed full blown AIDS . Some of these initial symptoms are swollen lymphnodes throughout the body , night sweats , and a mild to moderate general malaise . Freddie may have mentioned something to his doctor at one of his checkups - or his doctor may have had his blood tested for HIV along with other possible diseases that were routine for sexually active gay men . If an ELISA HIV test would have come back positive in 1985 , Freddie 's doctor would have told him , but would also have told him of the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have requested him to do a second , third , or fourth follow-up test . <p> October 2nd , 1985 " Rock Hudson dies from AIDS . <p> It is strange that toward the fall of 1985 , Freddie suddenly left Munich and returned to London . Some may say it was because he was ready to settle down at Garden Lodge . But I know that when Freddie did leave Munich toward the end of 1985 - it was for good , it was sudden and unexpected , and it was a life altering move . Something had changed him . He had abruptly cut off some of his closest friends from that city " Kurt ( died from AIDS ) , Winnie K ( died from AIDS ) , &amp; Barbara Valentin ( to name a few ) without even returning their phone calls or offering any real explanation for the sudden and drastic departure . Gone too were his one night stands , recreational cocaine/ecstasy use , and clubbing he had partaken in Munich ( and elsewhere throughout the previous years . Another person that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been employed under Freddie/Queen since the mid-70 's and had worked for Queen as recently as the Live Aid concert in July of that year . He was , in many respects , Freddie 's sexual liason when Queen were on tour . If you wanted to get to Freddie in a club , you had to go through Paul . Paul , an Irishman , was tough and cheeky . He was someone who specifically knew Freddie 's sexual tastes and became Freddie 's go between for fishing out anyone Freddie particularly fancied at a club , but did n't want to bother with the negotiating of a possible tryst . All- I know is that something must have happened to Freddie in late 1985 that made him ditch Paul Prenter and the party boys at the nightclubs in Munich and retreat to Garden Lodge . Could it have been a doctor telling him that he may have the dreaded and deadly diagnosis that was going to kill him ? <p> 1986 - is where the- crap really begins to hit the fan . It was in 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can bet that all the members of Queen would have taken out insurance to cover a whole gauntlet of possible liabilities that may arise in the face of a disaster while on tour . Freddie , most likely , under the guidance of Jim Beach , took out a policy that would cover- expenses if Queen were unable to take the stage at , let 's say , Wembley Stadium , because Freddie lost his voice due to a health issue . <p> Health insurance is essential for singers who earn their living from their instrument . Cover for touring abroad , loss of voice , accidental injury , engagement cancellations and loss of earnings will protect the singer if they are unable to perform due to illness or other unforeseen events . In 1984 , the last time Queen started a tour , the ELISA HIV test had not been available to Insurance Companies for the screening of their clients for HIV . You can bet that any insurer willing to cover a voice like Freddie Mercury 's on a Stadium Tour across Europe would want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of having to pay thousands- or even- millions of pounds due to a tour or concert cancellation if Freddie became ill. - It is almost a certainty that before the beginning of the Magic Tour , Freddie , whose liability would have been greatest in the band , would have been tested for many diseases ( Now including HIV ) and would have found out that he was positive for the virus . No insurance company in their right mind would offer coverage to a person with HIV - especially in 1986 when AIDS was a death sentence . <p> We all know Freddie decided to do the tour -even though he would have been aware of the gamble : if he suddenly became i 'll or lost his voice ( like in Sun City , 1984 ) - he would be screwed financially ! His behaviour on the tour seems to back up this theory. - The other band members noticed that something was up with him . He was n't out partying anymore . Paul Prenter was n't hired for the tour. - ( Paul Prenter also- died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the last one ! <p> Even though my above ' theory ' would have a doctor telling Freddie that he had tested positive for HIV in late 1985 or early 1986 , that doctor would have told him that the test result may not be so &amp; He would have had to go for multiple tests - and when test result after test result would have come back positive throughout 1986 , perhaps Freddie did n't want to hear it again . Perhaps that is why Mary Austin says she- received a call from his GP telling her that Freddie was n't returning his calls and to tell Freddie to call back him ? - ( Do you recall a tabloid story in- The Sun ( sept 1986 ) - alleging that Freddie had recently taken an AIDS test and Freddie angrily responding : Does it look like I 'm Dying ? ) <p> Early 1987 , coincidentally , saw the development of a newer and more reliable HIV test called the Western Blot . It was a much more accurate test than the ELISA . My hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and a half earlier in 1985 . He had gone for test after test throughout 1986 and finally , in the Spring of 1987 , along with a lymphnode b <p> Barbara Valentin claimed in one of the biographies that Freddie was first tested in 1985 and already had developed minor unexplained and unusual physical symptoms . - That makes sense as the diagnosis we know about was made based on KS , an AIDS defining illness , which indicates an advanced course of infection which was likely preceded by other symptoms . <p> I think up to the Magic Tour , it was just lingering suspicions that he might have HIV but- there was a hope- he could escape this fate. - You can see in- the Wembley DVDs that he was still in high spirits. - However , in the music videos for the Miracle album he looked very sombre. - The contrast in mood is very clear . <p> I- know the Jim Hutton book is taken with a grain of salt . But according to that book Freddie was worried that- he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate this thread too .

@@6701695 <p> After extensive research that I have discovered that Freddie was n't the saint he claimed to be . Be warned that the following facts may alter your no doubt rose-tinted memory of Freddie and if you are happy living with the lies , you should read no further . <p> Freddie 's acts of generousity were legendery . One day whilst walking through Hyde Park in London , he came across a young homeless man who asked if Freddie had any spare change . Of course Freddie never carried any cash on him but he rushed home to fetch his post office account book . He then withdrew 10,000 in small change ( mostly 5 and 10 pence pieces ) and took it back to the homeless man in Hyde Park with the aid of a wheelbarrow . He then dumped the 10 grand in change onto the pathway and siad mockingly " Get down on your knees you filthy urchin ! Go on crawl on your belly for the pennies I simply can not be bothered to keep around my massive 10 bedroomed mansion . " He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hobos who had ammased and walked away laughing and twirling his moustache between his thumb and forefinger . <p> Freddie like to steal things from hotels . When he died ' his house contained 35 bathrobes , 113 ashtrays , 9783 bottles of shower gel and 2 trouser presses . It was later estimated that if was n't for people like Freddie , hotel bills would be 28% cheaper . <p> Freddie may have been an awsome talent but he was never the most broad minded of individuals . Freddie was openly hetrophobic and felt he could never relax in the company of straight men . " It 's not that I have anything against them personally you understand . It 's just the thought of guys standing around drinking beer and talking about football and sticking their willies into women 's vagi ..... Oh My God ! I think I 'm going to be sick ! " said the flamboyant poof . It is not known weather Freddie approved of his bandmates sexuality but Brian May gave an insight to their volatile relationship during an interview in 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's I geuss he can just kiss my wife 's ass . " <p> The phrase " killing with kindness " is particularly relevant in Freddie 's case . Over a period of seven years , 54 cats died at Garden Lodge from excessive kindness . Many simply could not handle the cavier and goose pate and champagne that Freddie fed them each day and had liver failure . Other 's were kept so clean that they had vitually no immune system and died from the slightest infection . One small white kitten named Spook burst into flames after pissing in a mink fur litter tray with an electric blanket at the base . <p> I'ts funny that you should mention the death of the koi carp and Freddie 's ashes in the same story . The real reason for the death of all those expensive fish is that Mary 's eldest son mistakenly fed the ashes to the koi believing it to be fish food . The carp ate Freddie 's ashes and contracted the same disease that killed Freddie . Huh ? ... Huh ? Think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions like you perhaps , have always known that.But your ignorance , as your accusations is not totally unexpected , though unwelcome ( in my opinion at least ) .

I find this particular period of history to be vulgar , buse and vile . 
@@6701697 <p> While we 're on the subject of guitars , does anyone know where I can get any Brian May-style bass guitars that used to be made by Dillion ? They apparently do n't make them anymore , and I 'm upset about that , as I 'm actually getting good at playing bass guitar , and I want to own one of those guitars : * ( <p> Looks like a Jackson Randy Rhodes or one of the models produced similar to it . I 'll warn you if you 're wanting to get one that they are near impossible to play sitting down , standing up the weight proportion is awful and they are easy to damage cause of the strange shape . However , they do kick out the sound , especially for heavier stuff . I had one for a few years , but I did a p/x deal with it a few years back . <p> It 's indeed a Washburn Flying V. And as said by some others : this guitar might look very cool , playing should realy ' fit ' you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a very early version and in fact not such a good guitar technically ... <p> I know it does indeed look the same as a Jackson flying v. ( or should I say ' the same as SOME Jackson flyin v 's ) . But you ca n't just tell a brand from the shape ! Let me tell you that BC Rich has a model that is also exactly the same , Ibanez as well , as have a couple more . Also Jackson has ' regular ' Flying V 's , as the Washburn you found . Even some Jackson Randy Rhoads-models have the " even " Flying V. The " shortened " flying V has become a ' standard ' shape as much as the regular flying V , the Les Paul and the Fender Stratocaster models are represented in many different brands . <p> But have a look at the headstock . There is a brandname/logo on there and it reads ... ' Washburn ' ! ( The old logo ) <p> I understand the reason Brian used other guitars besides the Red Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , he uses the John Birch copy in the Spread Your Wings and We Will Rock You videos because he was concerned about having it out in the cold for so long ( at least I assume that 's why , or maybe he just did n't for a different look for those videos ) . <p> In the Play The Game video , he used a Strat copy because , as he says on the audio commentary on the DVD , he did n't want to throw the Red Special across the sound stage to Freddie . <p> Presumably , with the Princes Of The Universe video , they were using so much pyro and there 's the bit where he 's standing on the staircase and it starts to crumble , I think he was worried that the Red Special could be damaged . So , they probably rented that white Washburn just as a means of having what was essentially a throw away guitar that if it got damaged , hey , just pay whatever it cost to rent the guitar , and you were done .

" <p> Yes , if a request not to record them is ignored then that 's pretty poor form , but realistically these are the only way we 're ever going to here any of these tracks ... if they are going to publicly air them for people to hear at conventions , what difference does it make if a few hundred more of us hear them here ? If they do n't want them listened to , do n't play them at all ; it all smacks a bit of the band being persuaded to let snippets be aired just so those airing them can give a " look what we 've heard properly and what you 're missing out on " type sneer to the rest of us . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg Brooks himself showed a fake out-take of the recording of the sentence for comic effect in one of the Fan Club Conventions , so there 's a ' clean ' version of the line going around - that 's for sure . <p> The title does not ring a bell for me , and I 've compiled somewhere a list of everything Greg used to show in the Conventions .

As for me , I ca n't think of many <p> Except this : <p> Throughout all the years of my fandom ( ups and downs etc ) I 've never seen much attention given to Freddie 's ARTWORK .... not his collections .

Maybe a traveling exhibition one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it on your word that you 're not trolling the super fans here ; - ) <p> I thought my message was simple and to the point .

I was never his lover ... just a good friend . There is a picture of Freddie , his boyfriend at the time , John Murphy and myself in a jacuzzi that circulates around . As you may know , when I met Freddy , I was a nursing student at Columbia University in New York . I first worked at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center just a few blocks from Freddie 's skyrise New York apartment .

@@6701731 <p> I think Brian once said that in 1984 , when Queen decided to try a Christmas single , he wrote " I Dream Of Christmas " and Roger wrote " Thank God It 's Christmas " . The band then decided to record TGIC , with Brian helping finish the lyrics ( hence the co-writing credit ) . From that , it does n't sound like they recorded IDOC , but it 's possible they messed around with it or Brian did a demo . <p> Well there 's only one man that can answer this question . Some say he invented the curtain , and that if he does n't say ' Property Of Queen Productions ' at least every other sentence his head will explode . All we know is ... <p> From Brian May.com via Queen Vault.com , two quotes from Brian on the making of the two Christmas tracks : <p> Brian May : - " I always liked the record ... it 's something Roger and I did a rare early collaboration on . The original idea came from Roger , who had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too at the time .... it became Anita 's Christmas single ... " I Dream of Christmas " . But we judged the embryonic TGIC to be most suitable for a Queen track , and worked on it together - I added some tinsel , and the chorus idea , introduced by a modulating cascade of icicles , and it was completed pretty quickly . Nice and simple , and Freddie made a lovely job of singing it . I promise we will make a video for it one day ... the fact that there is no video for TGIC has of course always limited its exposure in these days of Video Supremacy ... We have actually been speaking about it ... but got too busy to manage it for THIS Christmas . So this is really good news ... it makes us happy that you have given the track new life .

Roger wrote the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the beginnings of " I Dream of Christmas " . We met down at Roger 's place and demo 'd both tracks together , as I remember . How the choice between the two tracks was made I do n't clearly remember , but I think it was a whole group thing . We decided to finish TGIC for the Queen Christmas single , and " IDOC " was put to one side , and I immediately worked it into the version which we released as my Lady Anita 's Christmas record . This record charted briefly but is now a rarity ( it features Anita singing , along with a school choir of young kids , and quite a lot of Guitar soloing by me ! ) For the eventual Queen song , Roger had the verse form already : " Oh - my love - we live in troubled days .... " . I contributed the chorus , with a key-change leading into it , using a lyric line which occurred casually in the verse , so this now became the title , " Thank God It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing it jumped into another gear ... his lovely high register soaring above the background in these choruses , then returning to a very gentle breathy texture for the verses . The background was based on a synth pad which Roger had found ( he would have to tell you what it was made with ) , to which I added a guitar texture very un-typical of me ... very clean and bright ... the amp turned way down and the strings hit hard like bells . This makes that Bright Frosty sound which I actually like a lot , contrasting with the warm and dark synth chords . Of course as usual John 's subtle firm bass lines are a big part of the style of the eventual outcome . The drums are programmed , the way Roger originally demo 'd them , an unusual choice for a Queen track but it works in this case .

@@6701743 <p> This book mentions that although Queen and Bowie recorded Under Pressure in Montreux , that Freddie and David Bowie recorded the vocals at the Power Station in NYC . The only other place I heard this is from Jon Bon Jovi . The album 's liner notes make no mention of recording in Manhattan . I know that at this point Freddie did have an apartment in New York , but I always was suspicious of this bit of trivia . Any thoughts ? <p> The first of the two sessions for Under Pressure was twenty-four hours and the second , a couple of weeks later and 4,000 miles away in- New York- when Freddie and Bowie finished off the track at the- Power Station , was a session which lasted another eighteen hours . Under Pressure came about purely spontaneously . Bowie , who was living in Montreux , heard that Queen were in town and just called round to the studio . Roger and Bowie got on very well anyway , although the lyric and title idea came from Freddie 's and David 's collaboration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've described .

' It was originally called People on Streets , and that was the basis of it , and we took the multi track tapes to- New York- and I spent all day there with David and mixed it that night . I remember , we were fiddling about and we got the bass line , and then we went for a pizza !

I think it was his idea actually . I did n't think it was a big enough hit . Actually I think it deserved to be a bigger one but I think that , you know , it was all a bit difficult . We had never actually collaborated actively with anybody before . So certain sort of egos were slightly bruised along the way . We never actually finished the record to my satisfaction .

Roger hung right in there " and Roger , who had been a fan of Bowie from way back , was very instrumental in making sure the track got finished . In fact it did n't get mixed until a few weeks later in- New York . - That 's a whole different story , but I was n't there , so all I know is that Freddie and David had different views of how the mix should be done , and the engineer did n't completely know how the studio worked !

Having said that Roger &amp; I did use the Power Station to cut Fun in Space . The guys all flew out then the following day I decided to join them as well and jumped on a plane to NYC . While I was in the baggage hall at JFK I made a phone call . 10 minutes after checking in to my hotel a vision walked through the door .

Did I want to stay and listen to Pressure a million times or go back to the hotel with my friend . No contest . Goodnight guys . The next day I decided I did n't really want to be at the mix and called Roger and said " Se ya in New Orleans in a few days . " I got a hire car and headed off to Pennsylvania to see Trip Khalaf .

I hope you really enjoy it , and here you have the changes list if you want to check : <p> General : - - -The intro sounds cleaner , you can find sounds that already were there but were inaudible , and understand better some things , like Freddie 's panned " I had a dream " at the intro. - - -New priority to the intro sounds , you 'll hear them a bit different . - - -More depth to the intro kick drums . - - -Different things were changed for each version ( extended , album &amp; single ) . - - -Eliminated LOTS of clicks , mainly during the intro and the outro parts . - - -New things priority all over the intro , more prominent keys and other effects . - - -Eliminated that instruments cut which is made when Freddie starts to sing . - - -New deep and kickass chemistry between the drums kick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - -So much cleaner sound to the jungle part , which was really really muddy . - - -Explosive start to the ending part , it 's a destructive rocking mess now ! - - -New drums line and fill at the very end of the song , to give a stronger ending . - - -Extended outro . <p> Drums : - - -More natural general sound and with more body . - - -More natural snare , new priority , leaving the whip one in second place . - - -The snare sounds stronger , it was like a whip , a weak whip , and in this song needs to kick asses . - - -A lot of depth to the intro drum kicks . - - -Cleaner drums start at the " But a cold wind blows " part . - - -Corrected some double hits between the kick and the snare at the 3:48 fill . - - -No snare reverb cut at the 3:52 " Ta-tah ! " , and added the kick at that part . <p> That 's quite an overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it reminds me of Rio era Duran Duran in places ( co-incidentally , their drummer is another Roger Taylor ! ) . It 's not unfitting with the track , but personally I would have used more of the ' Room ' drums from the stems to get an even more natural sound . I like the lifting of some of the vocals , and the guitar sound is good . I 'd say this is probably more of a radical remix than some of your other more subtle work , but all in all , a nice job . : ) <p> Lord Fickle said it best when he said this was an overhaul . He was correct ... but it made me wonder . <p> I downloaded it and heard it on computer speakers . Was n't sold . But ... I put it on a CD along with some other songs ... all I got ta say is HOLY SHIT this is EPIC ! You 're timeless ! I 've heard some other great mixes of this song in the past , and yes they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new level dude ! Ca n't wait to hear the rest of this ! <p> Hi , I 'm back ! Working a lot with the album . Thanks for the replies ! I 'm happy to read all this . I really like how it sounds now too . <p> Fickle , I can see what you say . It sound more like ' Rio ' drums , it 's true hahaha . The drums needed more power , the snare was a bit weak , the bass was like a matress , and the guitars were a bit low . They work now like alloy steel together . I wanted for the drums a more natural sound , but I wanted to enhance the snare and the kick to make it more punchier . Giving more room to the drums would make it feel even more natural , but it would sound a bit more raw , like NotW drums , more like a band rehearsing , a one take thing . I do n't thing this was the idea for the song . I thought like if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that silly jam feeling , like " We are in the best shape playing with new sounds and being totally free , no strict patterns , put this part here , and that one there " , that feeling of joy and freedom that you get when you see the making of , which I think the entire album is mainly about . It would be nice to experiment with a more raw version of this song too . <p> Bambams , those are good news ! The overall mixing of the album songs are fine for me , but it sounds a bit muddy , a thing that is hard to understand for me , having other bands like ' Go West ' or ' A-ha ' , from the 80 's , having a really clean sound . It goes with tastes I guess . Anyway , I find the album a bit sunken in the lows . The main mission is to give life to the hidden and lost sounds , which are a lot ! The original mixes work well , but as you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable . I 'm really anxious to upload some new songs . Really soon ! <p> Blaise , Action , HyperBoy and Cmi , thanks for the reply ! As Vali says , I 'll upload a FLAC of the entire album as soon as I finish it . By the way , Vali , those words above were really nice , thank you very much ! It 's great for me too to share my passion with people that I know that are interested on it . <p> BETA and Elektra , all I can say is that I love how it is sounding right now , the songs are going in a good path . AKoM is really catchy and punchy now with that hypnotic bass line and the drums line , OYoL is a pain to work with ( the audio clip was like broken at some points ) but it 's sounding better and not so empty , PIsCTP is sounding clean and poppy to the point I ca n't stop singing it , FWBF is nicer and more powerful ( I added what Blaise suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choruses except the first one ) , WWtLF just gives me chills at the final choruses and during some points , GtP ... well ... it changed , DLYH is more agressive and discovers a lot of unaudible sounds ... and PotU ... it just blows my head away . <p> I 'm happy with the album by now , but I 'm working a bit slowly , as I experiment with ' Jazz ' too , but putting 99% of my effort on ' AKoM ' . <p> A little ... something : ( I know it 's a bit perfectionist , but I changed the place of the " Ha ha ! " so the second " ha " goes with the snare ) <p> Thank you very much for the Happy Easter wishes ! I was on vacation a few days , but now I bring some good news .

I 'm having problems with the chords though . Never mind though . I 'm sure it will come to me . F.M . <p> 5th JANUARY 1979 Dear Diary I am writing this from my hospital bed where I am being treated for burns to my hands and concussion . I had been working on that Rock-a-billy song all day and had all but given up for the night . I decided to have a soak in the bath when all of a sudden I had a great idea for a riff . I shouted for pheobe to bring me a guitar while I was still in the bath so I could try it out . I honestly thought he would have had the sense to bring me an acoustic guitar . The next thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hospital . <p> 18th NOVEMBER 1984 Dear Diary That arsehole Jim Beach phoned me at 4.00am this morning to ask if I wanted to appear on some shitty charity single . The whole thing is called Elastoplast or something and it 's being put together by some Irish guy called Bob Godfrey ( is n't he the guy that does Henry 's Cat on kids telly ? ) and a minature Scotsman . They want to get a load of singers to record a single in aid of the starving children in Eastbourne or something . So far they have roped in Bananarama and Kool &amp; the Gang . I told him to fuck off and went back to sleep . F.M . <p> 25th NOVEMBER 1984 Dear Diary Had a lie in this morning . Pheobe brought me breakfast in bed and the morning papers . Splashed all over the front pages were photos Phil Collins , Bono , Duran Duran , Boy George , Spandau Ballet and George Michael . It appears that they have got together to record a charity single in aid of the starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to No 1 . How come nobody told us about it ? F.M . <p> 13th JULY 1985 Dear Diary Well today is the big day . There 's quite a crowd in the house today and we are all watching the beginning of the concert on telly . I noticed Jim , Roger , Brian and Crystal sitting behind Charles and Di at the opening ceremony . I 'll bet you a pound to piece of shit that Crystal is trying to get into Diana 's knickers . Well the car is here to pick us up so I 'll write again tomorrow . F.M . <p> 14th JULY 1985 Dear Diary I think yesterdays performance is one of the finest we have put on in years . Ok so we were only on stage for twenty minutes or so but it went really well for us . Brian &amp; I came back on later to perform ' Is This The World We Created ? ' and some twat fucked it up by doing a sound check during our set . Rest assured that bugger is now floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . When we got back we watched the whole show which Pheobe had videoed for us . Status Quo were n't too bad but Rick 's nose looked a little odd . If he does n't take it easy with the charlie he 's going to end up with one big nostril . Poor old Adam Ant was n't exactly on top form was he . A performance as bad as that can send a guy doolally and I would n't be surprised if I woke up one morning and read in the paper that he had been flung in a looney bin for waving a gun around or something . I will have to have words with Phil Collins and Howard Jones . I leant them my prized white grand piano for the show and they both had drinks sitting on top off it . Have these buggers never heard of coasters before ? I think I 'll send them a turd in the post . Elton was n't bad either but the guy who came on to sing with him was fantastic . I think his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more importantly , what a body . It 's a pity he 's straight . Bowie was on top form for a change . As a performer I like him but he has a bad habit of making a prick of himself with some symbolic gesture . I swear to god , if I ever get hit by a bus and killed and someone puts on a concert in aid of me , I do n't want Bowie within a million miles of it . The twat would probabaly end up on one knee reciting the Lord 's prayer or something . On the whole it was a good day and we raised a lot of money for starving kids in Africa . We also discovered we enjoyed playing together again as a band . Tomorrow I 'll ring the lads and we 'll arrange to get together in the studio . We might even record a song inspired by Live Aid and then the good old fasioned British press can rip the piss out of us for cashing in on an African famine . F.M . <p> 22nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came around earlier and talked me into issuing a statement to the press confirming that I have AIDS . Fucking parasites have been camped outside for the past couple of weeks now and I ca n't even go for a walk around the garden without those maggots peering over the wall trying to get a picture . Still it 's not all bad news . That fat bastard Maxwell from the Daily Mirror fell off his boat and drowned last week . You would think a guy that resembled a whale would feel more at home in the ocean , would n't you ? Let 's hope Rupert Murdoch has some lion-taming lessons booked before I peg it . F.M <p> 23rd NOVEMBER 1991 Dear Diary I feel worse today than I have felt in a long time . The statement went out last night and today 's papers are full of it . Rick Sky from the Sun Newspaper kindly sent me an advance copy of my biography entitled ' The Show Must Go On ' I glanced through it and reminiced on all the great times we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever having met the little cunt . Not to worry . I 'll have one of my boys go round and break his thumbs for him . Well I 'm feeling a little tired now so I 'll try and get some sleep and write again tomorrow . F.M . <p> It would be unfair to dominate so much space with every enrty in Freddie 's diaries ( many of which are just birthdays , anniversaries and so and so forth ) so from now on I will only post those entries that are requested by the fans . Let me know what you want to read about and the date ( so I can make it up ..... I mean look it up ) and I will post what I find . <p> Bohardy&gt; Oddly enough between the years of 1969 and 1973 , Freddie mentions 5 seperate murders that he was involved in . Although he makes no link between Bohemian Rhapsody and the fourth murder , certain facts from the case files suggest it may have something to do with the song . The following extrct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am writing this with one hell of a hangover and a bad case of guilt . I went to a party last night and got smashed out of my head on drink and drugs , in fact when I opened my eyes this morning to look at the sky , I was unable to distinguish between real life and fantasy . I wish I could invent a hangover cure but that would take a degree in chemistry and a lot of funding . Unfortunately I am a relatively poor boy as is my family . Still , I have never felt the need for sympathy and I expect none . Anyway back to last night 's party . I got talking to a handsome young chap but the music was so loud we ended up going out into the garden to chat . He was very complimentary to me and said he admired my simplicity , the way I very easy come easy go . As we chatted he produced some cocaine and we snorted a couple of healthy lines each . Every time we started to get low we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chopping out a line when a light breeze picked up and blew about ten quids worth off the mirror . The guy I was with started shouting and swearing and generally throwing a wobbler about the waste of 10 worth of good quality ching . I pleaded with him to calm down and told him that at least the wind had blown the coke in his direction . He was still going mental and told me in no uncertain terms that it did n't matter which way the wind was blowing . He was still stomping around the garden throwing a hissy fit and I knew I had to try and calm him down . I splapped him around the face but this just made him worse . He chased me back inside the house and I ended up having to hide in a cupboard . It was while this lunatic was hammering on the door baying for my blood that I noticed a shotgun propped up in the corner . It must have belonged to the hostess 's father who was a keen shooter . I armed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door . The guy was still there threatening to puch my lights out so I did what any other sane , rational person who was ripped to their tits on coke did . I put both barrells to his head , pulled the trigger and blew his brains all over the lovely Laura Ashley wallpaper on the hall wall . Well a brutal murder with a shotgun is enough to dampen the spirits of any party and the guests began to disperse . I did n't fancy hanging around either so I thanked the hostess for a lovely evening , apologised for the mess and went home to bed . When I woke up this morning and remembered the events of the previous evening I began to feel remorse and needed to speak to someone . I phoned Mum and told her everything . How I had killed a man , how I felt as though I had thrown my whole life away . I was scared in case the police came around , arrested me for murder and I would be hanged until Mum reminded me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool about the whole situation then she put Dad on the phone . Dad is n't as calm in these kind of situations and I knew I was going to get a flea in my ear . By this time of course the coke was wearing off and I was getting shivers down my spine and my body was aching . Dad as expected went mental . It 's hard to understand the old fella when he gets into a strop . He 's of Persian decent and starts using words I do n't fully understand , like Basmillah , Scharamuche and Fandango . He even told me I was grounded for the next three weeks . I told him I was going on tour with the band then I heard my folks arging about whether they should let me go . ' Let him go ' says Mum ' We 'll not let him go ' replies Dad and this just goes on and on with them contradicting each other . In the end I screamed ' Let me go ' and I could h <p> 11th JANUARY 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a steaming mug of Ovaltine and my beloved diary . Today we spent hours auditioning for a new Bass Player . There were four in all and if there 's one thing I have learned about bassists , it 's that they are all as dull as dishwater . The first guy looked as though his mammy had knitted him , ran out of wool for his ears and used a pair of socks . I swear to god he looked like a fucking spaniel . The second guy insisted on showing us slides from his holiday in the Isle of Wight . The third guy came in wearing a tank top and tartan bellbottoms and the fourth guy was so mind numbingly dull that Brian attempted to slash his own wrists before he had even started playing . It looks as if we are going to go with the third guy . I 'm not sure if he is a qualified clergyman but his name is Deacon John , maybe he 's a monk . He can certainly handle his instrument but Roger has reservations about having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy . I explained to them that the duller the bassist looks , the more flambouyant we might appear . A major plus is that Deacon is a bit of a whizz kid when it comes to electronics . He might come in handy if we ever need a lightbulb replaced or something . F.M . <p> 29TH NOVEMBER 1990 Dear Diary Not much happening today . Had a band meeting concerning the Greatest Hits 2 album . I hate those kinds of meetings . Thank god there will never be enough material around for a third . Most of the Newspapers are focusing on the departure of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister . I have never been that political and I never bothered to vote but I like most sane people on the planet am glad to see the back of her . I met her in 1984 at some charity function or other . Well when I say I met her , what actually happened was I went into the gents lavatory and saw her standing at the urinal having a slash . She then washed her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till doomsday but she 'll never get the blood of the miners off them . I have never heard of this new guy before . I do n't know if he is a military man but I think his name is Major John . He looks a bit of a speccy twat and the weirdest thing about him is that he appears to have a moustache under his skin . Well that 's all for today . I still have my medication to take and I want to write some more material for a possible posthumous album . F.M <p> EXACT DATE UNSURE 1984 Dear Diary Well it seems as if I 'm mister unpopular at the moment . We shot the video for our third single from the Works album today . ' It 's A Hard Life ' . I wrote the bloody song so I think it 's only fair that I dictate what outfits we wear . I wore a sexy red number with ostritch feathers and a line of eyes running from my chest down to my pecker . The lads came into my dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a giant prawn . I soon wiped the smiles off their faces when I showed them their outfits . Brian 's togged up in a skanky old brown fur coat that I picked up at a cancer research charity shop . The assistant assured me that it 's previous owner was incontinent and had died in it . I bought the previous owner too and had her skull and thigh bone turned into a guitar . I dressed Roger in a rather fetching black and white number which he did n't seem to mind until I showed him the ruff . He looked as if he 's swallowed a pavlova and it got stuck in his throat . As Deaky had laughed at my costume the loudest I made sure he got the worst of the bunch . Ha Ha . It was supposed to look like a horse buthe looks like a fucking pantomime cow . He could n't get the hat on though , he 's still going through his afro phase . The video went without a hitch , apart from that fat cow Barbera Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces like thunder . So now they 're not speaking to me and calling me Mr Bad Guy .... hang on that gives me an idea for a song . F.M <p> APRIL 1974 Dear Diary This morning we arrived in Japan to kick off the tour . There were over three thousand fans there to greet us all screaming ' WE LOVE ROGER ' ' WE WANT ROGER ' ROGER IS ACE ' . Well if Japan wants Roger they can fucking well have Roger . The country is one almighty shithole and I ai n't  coming back . F.M . <p> Dear Diary I 've been working on a song for the new album which deals with our ex-managers . It 's hardly what you might call a cheerful little ditty in fact it contains references to the shameful and underhanded way they dealt with our finances . I have the framework of the melody and most of the lyrics but I 'm struggling to come up with a suitable title .

His drum set during The Works Tour and The Magic Tour sounded awesome , especially the electronic drum kit attachments of the drum set during The Works Tour .

Does anybody know what the names or models of the drum sets from The Works Tour and the Magic Tour were ? <p> I would n't put it past them to not know about that . I think QueenConcerts is more known for the concert info it provides ( setlists , recordings , etc ) - rather than the equally excellent- technical info it also provides . <p> I know it 's a case of personal preference , but I ca n't believe that you prefer the drum sound on the Works tour to all others ! - I think ( certainly this view is shared by- most musicians I know ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Roger had , certainly on the recordings available that we 've heard . <p> Just off the top of my head the Works kit was a Ludwig chrome finish ( but I do n't know the exact model ) , and the Magic tour kit was- Yamaha ( possibly stage or recording 9000 custom ) . - As others have pointed out , the queenconcerts.com site will surely provide the info you need . <p> The Works kit was a Maple classic Ludwig set in chrome finish , pretty much the same as he had always used over the years , just a different finish , the sizes were slight smaller in some cases than the good old days of the 70 's but it 's basically the same kit , just a new version <p> The magic tour was a Yamaha 9000 series <p> Of the two kits Roger used the chrome one for recording as well as touring for some time , it 's on the one vision video and he used it for a number of other projects including rehearsing for a tour with Robert Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again after the tour and he moved quickly back to Ludwig with the maple finish version seen on the Freddie tribute and used to record most of Queens final moments on record <p> As for sound quality , heads and mic choice and placement play a big part , check out the crappy sound of the Rock in Rio gig then compare it to The Miracle album say or Hot Space , its all the same kit , yet they all sound different . <p> Personally I think his best sound is a between ANATO and Cosmos , You 're My Best Friend has the best sounding toms ever recorded IMO , and Cosmos plus the last tour was just great ( from a drummers POV ) <p> " It is better to sit in silence and have people think you 're a fool , then to open your mouth and remove all doubt " <p> Love The Yamaha 9000 series from the Magic Tour .

@@6701756 <p> Some of you ( Patrick , Bob , Gregsynth , JSS , etc - forgive me if I do n't know some of the musical / audio ones of you more than others ) may be interested in the audio info of the latest FM singles collection . I ca n't speak for the vinyl collection , but I did get a copy of the 2-cd version , and wanted to compare it to the previous latest " mastering / remastering " which was the 10-year-old ( really ? ! ) Singer of Songs collection . <p> So far , I have only opted to do a quick sampling of a few tracks that I know were from the same masters : <p> Up first - Goin Back <p> Between Singer of Songs and Messenger , they are virtually identical masters . There 's a slightly longer pause at the beginning of the Messenger version , and it may be a hair overall louder - but looking at the waveforms and listening critically - they have n't doctored the pitches or messed with the audio at all from previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version ) <p> Again , judging the waveform , NO changes have been made from the version on Singer of Songs ... but it is almost exactly 20% louder on the Messenger CD . <p> and last - Love Me Like There 's No Tomorrow <p> same as Love Kills ... no detectable waveform differences , other than that the entire track is almost exactly 20% louder on the Messenger of the Gods collection as it is on the Singer of Songs collection . <p> I have to say , however , there 's no " brick-walling " here ... it 's not compressed . All peaks and valleys are intact in both iterations , and they are simply louder versions of the same dynamic mixes / masters . How they compare to waveforms of the *original* vinyl or even cd album mixes , i do n't know . This was just to see if QPL did any further " doctoring " to the masters that they released in 2006 's Singer of Songs vs. this new set . <p> I posted this on a few other forums ... this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got the 2 CD Hollywood Records version today . This set is the UK Mercury Records version with a Hollywood Records UPC/sticker over the Mercury barcode . The packaging is exactly like the Rainbow 2 CD digipack set . The booklet and liner notes are fine and the song descriptions are a bit longer than those in Greatest Hits . There are a few pictures I have n't seen before , so that was nice too . The booklet is housed like the Rainbow booklet was , which makes it hard to access . <p> There are a few song versions that are not necessarily correct . Namely , the Time tracks use the 2000 Dave Clark Remixes . Dave Clark is very possessive of his catalogue , and I assume these are the only versions he would allow . So , this makes an incorrect version for In My Defence , which should be the Ron Nevison Mix . The Time version should be the original 1986 Single Version , but again is the Dave Clark 2000 remix . Masterings are from a mix of sources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Metcalfe with help from Peter Mew and Eddy Schreyer . Each song has a specific copyright date , which would tell you which remaster it is . Here we go .... <p> A few things to note : - She Blows Hot And Cold is the complete , correct version that appeared on the original vinyl single . Later releases did not include the studio banter and count in at the beginning . This is the first time this has appeared digitally. - I Can Hear Music and Goin ' Back have new remasters. - The Exercises In Free Love ( Montserrat Vocal ) is the correct version and does not have studio banter at the beginning ( unlike the 2012 Special Edition box set ) . - Most of the Mr. Bad Guy tracks were remastered except for Let 's Turn It On , which still uses the Peter Mew remaster . I was hoping the whole album was remastered for a future release , but Let 's Turn It On not being remastered leads me to believe that is not the case . - For whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose to keep the Kevin Metcalfe mastering credit where they could ? - Overture Piccante , which is the only Barcelona album version to appear , is sourced from the 1992 Eddy Schreyer remaster . This remaster was used on the Solo Collection as well . To my knowledge , Barcelona has only had one remaster , and that would be the 1992 Schreyer one . <p> Thanks - with regard to ' She Blows Hot &amp; Cold ' , is it the version featuring Brian ? ( I ca n't remember if that was the version on the single or not ) - I 've read some previews recently that give different accounts as to whether it 's the Brian version or not , and therefore the booklet info might be correct or not . Thanks . <p> If the Dave Clark material is not the original single versions then this should be clearly labelled in the booklet info - if they do n't mention it and are trying to pass it off as the original mixes then that 's poor . <p> Thanks - with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the version featuring Brian ?

For most territories it was paired with the non-album She Blows Hot And Cold ( featuring Brian May on lead guitar ) . -+ So I 'm a bit confused ... <p> Did the original b-side version feature Brian on guitar , or the other guy ?

@@6701760 <p> Has Dr. May ever used one of this cool things for his guitar work ? Sounds to me that the opening of the " These are the days of our lives " guitar solo needs the use of an e-bow to bend the note like that . Other than that i have no idea . Do you ? <p> He used it live only on Get Down Make Love , between 77-82 ... as well as his solo spot on the NOTW tour ( after White Man ) . <p> At first I thought NOTW tour , but in that picture BM appears to have " shorter " hair which would date it around The Crazy tour , during some of those shows he wore that white jacket , and also a similar one .

Here is his reply : - <p> " To tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Good Company " , though it was a long time ago and I could possibly have forgotten ! ! As I remember it , I did it all with the small " Deacy " amp , with microphones placed at various places relative to the speaker cone , depending on what tone I wanted the part to have , plus in some cases a " Wah Wah " pedal set to a particular place in its range , to colour the sound , and for some sounds , a volume pedal to vary the attack of , say , the " trombone " . <p> I DID use an E-bow on stage though . It was very useful for starting off my long solo at one point . I could make long Whale-like noises by gently moving the device up to a position over a low string .

Must get another one to play around with ! ! ! The reason I did n't get heavily into it as a technique was really because I always liked to produce sustain by feedback through the air . This is quite controllable in one way , since you can move around the stage to get different degrees of positive feedback to keep the sustain going , but it 's also quite exciting because unpredictable things happen - the sustained note may burst into another octave or a higher overtone .

Brian <p> ( Jen , and for those who are wondering what the Hell I 'm talking about - the E-bow is a little chrome plated thing that looks like a weird kind of watch or something . You hold it over a string , and it picks up the vibrations , electronically amplifies them internally , and re-emits that particular frequency as a wave which excites the string further . A perfect classic " Positive feedback loop " situation . If you get it right , the string will sound forever , or until your E-bow battery runs out ! ! ! It 's a clever invention - and fun to use - giving an effect very like bowing a violin string ; hence the name - from " electronic bow " I guess . ) " <p> He used it live only on Get Down Make Love , between 77-82 ... as well as his solo spot on the NOTW tour ( after White Man ) . <p> At first I thought NOTW tour , but in that picture BM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around The Crazy tour , during some of those shows he wore that white jacket , and also a similar one .

You bunch of tacos , goodbye ! " However , it 's worth noting that on the second night , these were his closing words : " Thank you for being a totally different audience tonight . We all thank you .

@@6701774 <p> Yes , I guess that 's it , cause FHLI starts with instrumental often found in MOTBQ and then " Forget your singalongs ... " etc .

That piano fill before " forget your singalongs " is like an " its not over yet " sign , or at least that 's how I understand it <p> " Forget you singalongs " is the last part of " March of the black queen " , I think it has nothing to do with " Funny how love is " . They are not one song .

That 's an interesting point ( hard to prove though ) . But , even from a hypothetical point of view , they would still be technically the same song , since Rock It , Play The Game , Bo Rhap and probably others too , also were recorded by parts <p> Of course the " Forget your singalongs ... " is part of MOTBQ . That 's obvious to anyone with half an ear and brain . <p> FHLI officially starts with the acoustic-guitars and wall of sound , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the album the songs segued into each other , so that FHLI contains ( right at the very start ) some vocals continued over from MOTBQ . <p> On the Hollywood Records and original EMI releases the track-marker for FHLI was put in the wrong place , and therefore it appeared that the false-ending of MOTBQ actuallly belonged to FHLI . <p> The fact that the standalone single-version of FHLI starts with the acoustic guitars and not the " Forget your singalongs ... " , confirms this , as does the fact that on the original Queen II vinyl the " Forget your singalongs ...

The " fireflies " part would be weird in a single ; in a similar way that for example Liar was cut in the single version in the US , as far as I know <p> Just to add to the consensus here : I have Queen II on CD(Hollywood) and rather old vinyl(elektra) and both lyrics sheets include the " city of the fireflies " section as part of March of the Black Queen . <p> I have an old QII CD ( AAD without remaster ) from EMI Holland and there is TMOTBQ 6:03 min. long . And FHLI starts with ' Forget your singalongs ... ' and it 's 3:15 . Unfortunately this CD was without lyrics . <p> On QII from remastered series ( DMS 1994 ) there is TMOTBQ 6:33 long and ends with ' forever ' . FHLI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Forget your singalong .... forever ' paragraph is the part of TMOTBQ ( as it could be IMO ) . <p> I always thought , as ' Fireflies ' part is evidently from TMOTBQ , that there is factory mistake on the old CD ( AAD ) I have .

@@6701779 <p> I think that March Of The Black Queen forms sort of a couple with White Queen . WQ is on the white side of Queen II , MOTBQ is on the black side . In White Queen , written by Brian , I see the sad end of a wonderful relationship . In March Of The Black Queen , written by Freddie , I see the opposite : the relationship is far from wonderful , yet it continues . I think that MOTBQ is a very sarcastic song and tells us about the power that a certain woman has over her man , and all the stupid things that this man does to please her . Sometimes he is rewarded , most of the time he is punished . Makes him question why he follows her and where she goes , from the beginning of the song . These ups and downs are being reflected by many metaphors for alternating positive and negative feelings . Some examples about the nigger sugar and the blue powder monkeys that were mentioned earlier : <p> " A little nigger sugar then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression for raw cane sugar . During the slavery period , sugar was brought from Africa , where it had been extracted from sugar-cane . This extraction process was done by the slaves , who stamped it with their feet . After this , the raw sugar was further processed to clear it . The cheapest sugar was not post-processed and thus kept its brown colour . However , people believed that the brown colour came from the feet of the slaves , and thus this sugar soon was referred to as " nigger sugar " . Only the rich people could afford white sugar , and nigger sugar had to suffice for the poor . In this light , " a little nigger sugar " can be translated to a poor situation , or , can be seen as a metaphor for the dark side of the relationship . This however is followed by the " rub-a-dub-a baby oil " . If we consider the " dub-a " only to be a doggerel to " rub-a " , then it would read " rub-a baby oil " , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) baby oil " . This might relate to a massage and there you have the ups and downs in the relationship . <p> " Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night " ... " Powder monkey " is a slang expression for a person who carries or sets explosives ( the word comes from old navigation , where it was a boy employed on war vessels to carry gunpowder ) . A " blue powder monkey " would then be a sad person ( as in " having the blues " ) whose mind is in an explosive state . He 's praying in the dead of night for all of this to end . <p> Hey , just some thoughts : - ) Anyway , I once ran a geocities website which tried to interpret several old Queen lyrics line by line . MOTBQ was one of those and the text above comes from one of my backup files . I 'll try and see if it 's still online somewhere .

@@6701791 <p> Getting a decent sounding recording of this early Queen gig used to be quite a pain in the anus . Most of the previously available sources ( e.g. the famous bootleg " Supporting Mott The Hoople " ) sounded like extrements . Currently two main sources are available . <p> The first one , provided by The Real Wizard has clean sound , but it has an annoying , and I mean ANNOYING high frequency noise through the whole recording . It 's so annoying that I was never able to listen to the whole thing because the noise was just too painful for my ears . The second one , recently re-transfered using better equipment and shared on queenzone by The Kurgan does n't have that extremely annoying noise , and is more complete , but it has very bass heavy ( even after a subtle equalisation ) . But it 's still much more enjoyable than the previous version , because it does n't have that annoying noise . <p> I have done a careful hiss reduction of Kurgan 's source ( you can still hear some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you do n't like hiss reduction , but a ) I know what I 'm doing ( I have actually listened to ONLY the hiss of the complete recording only to be sure that I 'm not removing anything else than hiss ) and b ) Kurgan 's share is still available . I have also done some very subtle equalisation . <p> Then I noticed Kurgan 's recording has many small cuts , some of them could be replaced by The Real Wizard 's share , mainly the speech between Son And Daughter and Ogre Battle , a fraction of a second in Hangman and a few seconds in Liar . Still missing is a part of Hangman and the opening of Keep Yourself Alive , otherwise it 's complete . <p> Added as track 10 is the edited version of the soundcheck , again a dehissed version of Kurgan 's share . <p> Please do n't bootleg this , and do n't upload it to youtube - the only persons who have the moral right to make money from this recording are the members of Queen themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so blame him ; - ) Do we all get to hear your version , or is it just for Peter ? <p> It 's all on Wizard then !

" <p> So would I , but all in all I think that I 'd prefer if Queen were band of three lead singers , with Brian and Roger taking most of the leads in their own tracks and probably some cross-overs ( like Roger singing Doin ' All Right or Brian doing Love Of My Life live ) <p> &gt; then what would Freddie do ? <p> In ' Forever ' , he could take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 he could do harmonies ( like Axl Rose in Dust N ' Bones ) .

Perhaps as you say he did in ' 73- ' 74 but there 's no way to confirm or deny that . <p> &gt; Its incredibly difficult to play an instrument well and sing at the same time . <p> Not at all .

There 's no need to be smart about it . : - ) <p> I think that Brians voice during the seventies was sweet but not strong enough for singing live . On the other way , Roger is irreplacable singing his own songs because he makes such an impression in his songs that whether you like it or not you just cant imagine someone else singing ILWMC , and he has a very strong voice live .

Freddie was n't in that shape that he could complete the song , so he said that they would do that another time , but he did n't come back to the studio anymore . So " Mother Love " is surely the last song Freddie sang on . And that 's why Brian sings the last verse .. <p> " A Winters Tale " was the last song that Freddie wrote , but not the last one recorded . <p> Having read the question correctly &amp; mirroring a previous comment .

Which was written sometime in the summer of 1991 and sung in October or November 1991 .

No band has to replace Queen in any way . Every band makes their own music ; if a band sounds like another band , they 're not doing their job properly . <p> another ridiculous statement there . if one band sounds like another band then they are not doing their job properly . every band today or solo singers too are very influenced by other bands , who they personally grew up listening to . its only normal . it do n't  mean they are identical but there are a lot of similarities . <p> There 's a difference between ' being influenced by ...

I know , influenced is a long word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there really IS a difference . <p> I just got the new Muse album , and I was n't blown away , but there are a couple of good songs on the album . It 's all a little too electronic , synthesized , and over done to me . I was hoping for some more " rockier " feelings songs , but to my disappointment there were n't any . They are better than any other band out there today , but to me their music is a bit monotonous . That is something Queen never was . <p> Apparently some of you did n't read/comprehend some of my posts . Those of you basing your ideas off of ONE single , well ... I really have nothing else to say if you insist on doing that . in that instant , I suppose my claims are n't warranted in the least . <p> Furthermore , I agree Green Day may , in fact be the more established band of this generation , but I could even sift through their catalogue and siphon out some monotony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... do n't even get me started on Fort Minor . <p> As for you , Mr. Thomas , let me clarify a few things . I am in no way , shape , or form stating that Muse is trying to copy , recreate , or reproduce the sound of Queen in modern-day times . To think that a " good " band should be able to produce good material without soundlng like another band is utterly ludicrous . Do you think Queen made the music they did without being influenced by even one person or group ? <p> Perhaps the comparisons from my orignial post were a bit strong . All I am trying to get across is that if one listens to their ENTIRE CATALOGUE , Muse is producing quality work that touches many music genres--something that Queen mastered unlike any other band . The vocalist from the band is highly acclaimed and the music ( to quote from our dear friend Paul Rodgers ) often " makes a left turn when you think it is going to go right . " <p> Lastly , ( Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seem to suggest--referring to the statement that you made that I ca n't live with a past band . In all honesty , I would n't have been as exposed to Queen 's unbelievable work as I am now had Paul not joined Brian and Roger ( that should be evident from my ' shootingstar ' alias ) . But I learned to appreciate just what was created while Freddie was around . I simply see some similarities between the Quintessential Stadium Rock Band ( Queen ) and a band that has some considerable talent in a world mired with poor musicians and rappers . <p> Lynch me for trying to seek out the truly good and talented in the popular music industry . <p> Again , if you think I am making some horrendous , egregious comparison , please give me some examples of bands/artists you feel can hold a candle to some of the talented bands of the past . I eagerly await a response . <p> And I apologize if I sound antagonistic--I am merely trying to express my point in a more coherent fashion .

" Before Liar , he says , " And now a special Christmas edition of a little number called Liar . " Roger , before he jumps into Big Spender , says , " Alright , Merry Christmas .

During the years this concert was re-broadcasted by both TV and radio in many countries . Therefore many audio sources have appeared , but none was complete . Many parts , like the spoken concert introduction or Freddie 's christmas speeches appear only on the original TV broadcast , I will call this source the " video mix " .

It is also one of the reasons why this source ca n't be 100% used for this compilation , the second reason is the sound quality , which is much worse then the soundboard recordings . Since this concert was also broadcasted on BBC radio , this concert was recorded on soundboard . These multi-track master-tapes were later used to create 2 different soundboard mixes . The first soundboard mix , the " common mix " has great sound on the backing vocals , but the drum sound is not very good . This was the only mix used for all radio re-broadcasts , until the Swedish radio rebroadcast from 2 <p> My turn to have problems downloading , but I think this time everybody will have the same problem , your megaupload link for the Stark remaster has been deleted : http : //www.megaupload.com/ ? d=F9SCB4OE It says that you broke the rules , you ugly persona ...

@@6701830 <p> Some of you may have Japanese editions of Queen albums , and wondered about the Japanese text in the track listings . Most of the time , it 's a phonetic approximation of the English song title using Japanese ; so , for example , " The Hitman " is written out as " Za Hittoman " in Japanese characters . <p> Other times , however ( and almost randomly , it seems ) , the song title is given a new Japanese title that is not simply a phonetic double of the English . For example , the " It 's a Hard Life " has a Japanese title which means " Vow of Eternity " . In a minority of cases , a song has a phonetic approximation as its main title , and then a secondary title in Japanese written between two " " s . An example of this is One Vision , which is listed as " One Vision written phonetically Only One World translated from Japanese " . <p> I 've always been interested in this , so I decided to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and translated them back to English . Here you go : <p> Sheer Heart Attack Lily of the Valley - Lily of the Valley ( literally , as in a lily that is found in a valley , and not the name of the flower ) In the Lap of the Gods - The Work of the Gods Bring Back that Leroy Brown - " Leroy Brown " <p> A Night at the Opera - Night of the Opera House Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon - An Empty Sunday The Prophet 's Song - The Prophet 's Song <p> News of the World - Dedicated to the World We are the Champions - Legendary Champions Spread Your Wings - Wings of Eternity Fight from the Inside - Flames Hidden Within Sleeping on the Sidewalk - A Hollow Life Who Needs You - The Whereabouts of Love <p> A Kind of Magic - " Kind of Magic " One Vision - " One Vision " Only One World A Kind of Magic - " Kind of Magic " One Year of Love - The Days With Love Pain is Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends - The Bonds of the Heart/Spirit/Soul Who Wants to Live Forever - " Live Forever " <p> Innuendo I 'm Going Slightly Mad - An Overture to Madness All God 's People - Gods ' People yes , as in belonging to more than one God , even though the placement of the apostrophe in the English title indicates one God ; the translation could have been an error , mistaking " God 's " for " Gods ' " , perhaps due to the " All " in front These Are the Days of Our Lives - Shining Days Delilah - My Dear Delilah The Show Must Go On - " Show Must Go On " <p> Made in Heaven No translation . I Was Born to Love You is sometimes seen as " Born To Love You " . <p> Mooghead : I took a look at the Japanese lyrics for the talky bit in Keep Yourself Alive , and found that it was a spot on translation of the English . Do you remember where you saw a more interesting version ? <p> GratefulFan : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exact translation with the same number of syllables in both languages for ease of singing . The full line is " Te o toriatte kono mama ikou " which translates to " Let 's keep going like this while holding hands " or " Let 's hold hands and keep going like this " . I guess " Let us cling together " sounds better than " Let 's hold hands . " <p> LOL . This reminds me of lists that I 've seen of Star Trek episode titles translated back into English from various foreign versions of the show . IIRC Japan and Germany had the most hilarious translations.

He co-wrote a few with John , but i never felt they were from the heart . He also wrote a couple for the Barcelona album , but i believe so only because it 's such an important and obvious theme of opera . However , if you compare that with The Works ( Man on the Prowl , It 's A Hard Life , ) or Hot Space ( Body Language , Staying Power ) , or his solo work ( Too many to list ) , that was most definitely his theme of the early to mid eighties . I definitely think this fits in with them . Could be an interesting question to find the answer to though .

@@6701834 <p> I know many of you guys hate synths , but the truth is that most of the time Queen used their syths in a proper way . Yet still , there are a couple of songs where Queen should have never used synths . <p> If I had to name which song has the worst use of synths that would have to be ' Play The Game ' . The intro is awfuly cheesy and those cheap sci-fi flick sounds totally ruined Brian 's awesome guitar solo . <p> QUOTEQUOTENAMEBrandon wrote : /QUOTENAME ... and now the " best you can offer is Mr. Jingles ?

Simple , yet nice . They were done on a Roland Jupiter 8 by Fred Mandel . <p> PS- Interestingly , the synth intro to ' Play The Game ' was originally stored separately from the main song on the master tape . <p> Synths that I really hate - Play The Game - intro &amp; pre-solo , Hammer To Fall , and Body Language - in one of the pre-choruses <p> Synths that IMO sounded ok but I 'd have preferred John doing that with real bass : <p> Breakthru Body Language Dancer -with slap technique it would have sounded so good Staying Power - even if he did a loop , but the sound of a Fender is unique Radio Ga Ga - ditto <p> I like the trick in Pain Is So Close : bass is done in synths during the intro but just when the voice begins it changes to a human one . The effect is very ear-pleasing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , a clever combination of human &amp; machine . <p> I agree with you Mr. FredM . One of Queen 's greatest qualities is that they were willing to branch out into a myriad of musical styles and take risks with their core fanbase in order to explore a more diverse catalogue . That 's what makes Queen so great ... you ca n't pigeonhole them into one specific sound or genre : their diversity was one of their main strengths and made them infinitely more entertaining . Think about it ... if you listened to country or swing for hours and hours and hours you 'd eventually be dying to hear something different . Queen kept it fresh , and that 's what matters . <p> At the same time , I think it 's OK to like or dislike particular albums or tracks--everyone 's got a preference . You do n't have to love each and every song to love Queen . Opinions are really what drive a message board such as this : it would be quite boring if everyone agreed on everything . <p> Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synths were n't used as well in songs on The Miracle album . Those synth strings on " The Miracle " are just too bright for my taste and it gets kind of cheesy . Also , the synth on " Invisible Man " makes it sound a bit too " kiddie .

I 'd appriciate if anyone can help me with this . Thanks . <p> On Staying Power there 's no sexsimulation whatsoever , I think you mean Body Language . I do n't  like the use of synth-bass at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million times to have a bass-player . Just imagine for instance Staying Power , John playing those fast fills and ocassionally doing his Deaky licks , itd be much cooler than that monotone riff over and over again <p> " Hot Space " gets an honorable mention for worst use , but I would have loved to have heard more " real " instruments on " Mr. Bad Guy " . Both " Bad Guy " and " Hot Space " suffer from a lack of a " live " feel and too much production . After watching " Staying Power " on the GVH2 dvd , I wish Queen would have integrated more of their rock sound into the dance/r&amp;b groove . That album could have ruled ' 82 ! <p> P.S. I know that " Bad Guy " is not a Queen album , but it represents to me what can happen when someone suffers from synthesizer addiction . <p> FAHRENHEIT 911 <p> " Truth is the greatest of all national possessions .

All four members show off in a span of about 8 seconds ! Fantastic . 
@@6701835 <p> I am currently trying to put together ALL informations we have about the Knebworth show . It was the LAST concert in the times , when Queen consisted of Freddie , Brian , Roger , John and Spike , so it deserves a " proper " release . Since we wo n't get it from official sources , I want to make my own . <p> 1 . Was standing by the mixing desk unit , about 40 yards out from the stage. - Bottles started flying for about 5 minutes when a huge half a melon came flying over and actually hit one of the sound mixing guys on the back of the head . He was furious , staring out into the crowd with melon stuck in his hair , trying to find the culprit , to no avail . Me &amp;- my mate were crying with laughter . <p> 2 . The opening act came on ( guy called Belouis Some , who was awful , but I think Freddie was ' fond ' of him ) . Anyways , first three songs went by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then announced that his next song was called ' Target Practice ' ( no joke ) , and the whole stage was then swamped for about 2 minutes non-stop . Funniest thing was people were running out of bottles and huge chunks of turf were then sent inbound . Fucking hilarious ! <p> Well from what I read he was " shit " , " crap " etc. , so a recording probably does n't exist . Or does it ? <p> " This left the Scottish tinged act Big Country , to pave the way for the headliners , . Big Country were quite popular in the 80s , although they never had massive hits , their album ' The Seer " did chart at number 2 in 1986 , but for all that , they were rather strange band to be on this bill , as they would not seem to appeal particularly to Queen fans . Their music had a celtic feel to it and really did not connect to the populistic and anthemic Queen tunes , but who knows , perhaps they were on the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not likely to outperform Queen and thus steal their glory ... <p> Just how well Big Country went down is arguable as reported sources vary , with quotes regarding them doing four encores to none at all ! They were the recipients of a full 2 litre bottle of something or other thrown from the crowds , but they got a better reception than Beloius Some . " <p> Check out one of the Rarities cd 's , there is little bits on it filmed by Ian , cant remember the song but it shows the whole crowd singing back to Stuart . From what i 've heard Big Country went down great and i 'm sure someone told me Brian May watched them from the side of the stage . <p> 1986 - Quo returns with a new line-up .

Is This The World We Created ? - by DoRo crew Tutti Frutti - by DoRo crew Hammer To Fall - includes some IDENTICAL angles to the footage which was show on the big screen Radio Ga Ga - at least 3 different cameras - one identical with the ITTWWC footage , the other filmed from either the stage or right below the stage , and the third identical to the footage from the big screen We Are The Champions - the same as GaGa God Save The Queen - many many different angles , including some IDENTICAL angles as those shown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " **34;145;TOOLONG " Brooks and Mr. Brian " IDontWareWigs " May claim that the footage which was transferred to the big screen was n't recorded at all ?

I really doubt that Freddie could have sung " The Show Must Go On " or pretty much any other Innuendo song after " A Winters Tale " session . His voice is too strong on INNUENDO compared to " A winters tale " . By this time it-s pretty clear that Freddie-s voice is losing strenght , culminating with " Mother Love " . <p> I don-t have any evidence of this , but in this case , and FOR ME personally Freddie-s voice is guiving all the clues . <p> As i said before Great work Sebastian .

If you have or know of any such photo , please drop me a message or let me know here . <p> As for my local Station " Bayern 3 " MAYBE its worth trying to make contact to Mr.Thomas Gottschalk / Fred Kogel /Fritz Egner /J++rgen Herrmann ( DJs in the 70s &amp; 80s ) ... from the top of my head . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Fred Kogel if I remember correctly . <p> Ca n't say I 'm over excited by the Queen on Air product . I was hoping for and looking forward to The Hyde Park 1976 release , like most other Queen fans to be honest . To have an official release of something that 's been available for years in good quality on the internet seems pointless . But then , this is QPL , ( who seem to revel in rerere releases ) so I suppose that 's we have to expect . <p> Surely it has to be Hyde Park this year , anything else is going to be a major disappointment for me ( especially after the You 're My Best Friend snippet from the recent From Rags To Rhapsody documentary looked and sounded great ) . If for some reason the concert is deemed not good enough for a full official release it would be an excellent PR gesture on their part to share what they have via queenonline as a " thank you " to everybody for sticking with them over the last 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank the fans it would have a nice sense of symmetry ! ( I know I 'm pushing my luck on this one , I would be more than happy to buy it ) ! <p> Many fans out there - including me - were waiting for this type of product for a very long time ! This is great news indeed . <p> Well , i don-t have anything related to Gregs request in the first post but i wish him and QP luck in finding what they-re looking for . There is great interest for this kind of project from me and many other fans , so i really wish that the end product will be wonderfull . <p> I-m very excited that Greg mentions pictures until 1995 . Can we expect a limited Box-set of Queen on the radio through the years ( interviews ) to go along with the performances that will obviously be released for the general public ? I love Freddie-s interviews contained in the Box-set and this " Queen on air " project releases more space for a future Queen box-set in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So far , so good ! I-m excited about this project . <p> And by the way Greg , i-m really looking forward to the Freddie solo release this year : - ) I love " Mr.Bad Guy " and i hope you guys are doing something with it this year for the 70 birthday . All the best ! <p> Your lack of interest will be a crushing blow to us , from which I doubt I personally will ever recover . <p> you still do n't get it do you ? people ' round here help you time and time and bloody time again ... yet one person asks you a simple question about Hyde Park - and you ignore it with an arrogant contempt ... almost as if the question is irrelevant . <p> well it may be irrelevant to you , but to queen fans Hyde Park is important - especially in it 's 40th anniversary - but you ( being an archivist of such dubious ability ) probably were n't even aware of the significance . <p> think about it Greg - you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you do n't have this " or " such and such is definitely NOT in the archives " - but you 're ( usually ) wrong . <p> you could do with being a little more personable in your dealings with fans . without fans there is NO queen , and queen has paid you substantially down the years - without us , you 're an unemployed librarian . <p> So I 'm guessing the photographs would be for a possible booklet for the proposed Queen On Air project ? <p> Unfortunately , I do n't have anything to offer for this project , but I got ta ask this : Is it possible that Ratty might have some photos lying around of either John or Freddie in a radio station ? Just a thought , since he 's John and Fred 's roadie I 'm guessing he may have accompanied either one of them for those radio interviews , and perhaps had a photo or two taken . <p> Also , will the future product be similar to The Beatles ' Live at the BBC albums , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , wish you luck in this new project ! I look forward to its release . <p> Your lack of interest will be a crushing blow to us , from which I doubt I personally will ever recover . <p> Look sucker , people asked u in the past a lot of things , and they never have an awnser , and now you are asking stuff from us , Fuck off please with your annoying voice , You think thatyou are THAT ONE SPECIAL fan , now for me your lower than dogshit ! <p> Queen Archivist wrote : As you probably know by now , we 're working on a product focussing on Queen on the radio through the years .

@@6701856 <p> For years , a demo has been floating around , purporting to be a Roger Taylor solo track , from the Strange Frontier sessions , called " I Ca n't Get You Out Of My Head . " Roger sings lead vocals on this demo and it sounds pretty complete . The general consensus was that it , along with other leaked Roger demos , was from 1983 , when Roger was recording his second solo album ( the aforementioned " Strange Frontier " ) . Other demos appeared , also supposedly from that period : <p> Now , because of an earlier thread , I discovered that in May of this year , Clayton Moss released a solo album ( The Cross Section ) and on it is a recording of " I Ca n't Get You Out Of My Head , " as well as a few re-recorded Cross tracks : <p> Clayton Moss wrote- those three songs .

Are their origins suspect now too ? <p> I did send Clayton Moss the link to the discussion and asked him if he could clear this up for us but he did not answer . Pobably because Pim Derks did not edit his post : - ) - Maybe we will know more- if Roger 's solo stuff should come out ... <p> I read the other thread and it seems Clayton 's statements conflict with JSS 's attributions of which songs/demos came from which sessions . <p> " I Ca n't Get You Out Of My Head " is a Clayton Moss penned song . <p> " Celebration " is a Spike Edney penned song . <p> John , I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Clayton mentioned on his youtube comments that those two songs are from " the Jam studio recording sessions .

Here 's the link ... <p> To try and get this guitar sound , I just used what 's available to me atm - fender strat + guitar rig 4 software . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with me ! ) Guitar settings - neck p/up , tone about 50% volume backed off a little bit . Amp settings - marshall simulation w/very light overdrive and the treble rolled off a bit , little bit of chorus and delay and quite a bit of reverb . I played the chords with fingers rather than a pick - sounds less harsh and there is no pick raking across strings , just sounds altogether smoother . My strat trem is floating , so some slight upward vibrato with the bar , gets it sounding more May-like ! Pulling the strings fairly hard , gets the initial attack on the chords more overdriven , just for a moment - the main sound remains pretty clean/smooth though . The chord changes also sound really subtle - I used to think Brian was somehow bending the whole chord shape up from the A to D chord ! .. or that it was a multitracked 3-part harmony . It 's just really hard to hear the transition between the 2 chords . Ca n't really think of anything else to add . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wayy off ! Basically just try using fingers instead of a pick/sixpence and carefully adjust the tone/volume on the guitar , and do n't  use too much overdrive . Should get you kind of close .

@@6701892 <p> Please Read before watching . " LoZ:Princes of the Universe " is a Zelda music video based on the popular Highlander song.The idea behind this concept came to me after after listening to some " Queen " songs a few months ago .

In a way , I wanted to take the " Queen " music videos to another direction ( if that has n't been done yet ) . Mainly because , in my opinion , " Bohemian Rhapsody " has been done one too many times and this song is one of Queen 's hidden gems out of most of their greatest hits . The concept of this Zelda parody is taking the lyrics too seriously ( which is the main joke ) . There are also some jokes related to my Four Swords parody .

By the time the record number eight was playing it was great as the neddle arm went up and down , you could also play the same record over by turning the record arm towards the side.Great memories.I also used to fanatically used to tape the top 20 on a sunday evening , in those days it was presented by a guy called Tom Browne.It then became the top 30 and then the top 40 .

That 's why a Saint Martin person would be more impressive . Experience in working with Mozart 's music was all I was after . <p> It is highly debateable that Mozart would worry about his concertos , considering at times he was an arrogant ass . He knew what he was doing . He did n't question himself . All you have to do is see Amadeus to know that . <p> I also see that he said ( this is what I believe is a quote from Mr. Everett since you wo n't use quotation marks ) " like Mozart wondering " . As in , IF Mozart ( an obvious genius ) WERE to have pondered the greatness of his work . This in comparison to Freddie shows how silly it was to wonder indeed . But give the guy a break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive about it because it was something personal . <p> Sometimes classical music is a little over-rated compared to popular . I mean not always a classical piece will be more clever than a popular one . How many people read composition , harmony , counterpoint or arrangements for yonks and get phds and rubbish like that ? A lot . And how many of them can compose something like Stand By Me , What 's Up or Woman with 4 , 3 and 6 chords respectively ? <p> Fred couldnt have enabled composing long symphonic movements like W.A. Mozart , but the latter probably would n't have been able to compose something like Bo Rhap , complex and catchy at the same time , compressing such a long melody and so many sophisticated details in only six minutes . Nobodys " better " or " worse " , their expertise was different . <p> Same for critics : some so-called intellectuals only appreciate a musical piece if its got a thousand chords and plenty of tritone leaps , meter changes , modal swithces and counterpointal twists , while sometimes a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a not-so-complex track as , for instance , We Will Rock You .

Mozart did n't have the slightest problem writing catchy tunes , he composed hundreds , maybe thousands of tunes , simple and complex , short and long , for one instrument and dozens of instruments and Freddie with his 150 three to six minute songs or whatever can not in any way be compared with him .

Could he enable a much larger variety of simple and complex devices ? Of course . No doubt about that . Could any rock star compose like him ? no way . Could he compose like them ? No ( imo ) . No rock artist has ever been able to produce me the sensation I get with Pachelbells Canon as well as no classical composer has ever provoked me the feeling I get with Stairway To Heaven .

This gig seems to be very well-received by the fans waiting for Mott The Hoople to take the stage shortly . All previous copies of this recording from The Expo decreased in quality for the encore , but here on the master transfer , the entire show is presented in glorious quality , also without the speed problems of the old copies .

@@6701938 <p> I would like to find out what happened with the piano track of Bohemian Rhapsody . I noticed there is a little difference between the original piano track ( part of multitrack - also available on youtube ) and the piano track of the actual original song . And I do n't mean the beginning as I know that piano track at the beginning ( Is this the real life ... ) was later removed for the original song . Also piano track for rock section was later voiced down for heavy guitar riff in the original song . <p> What I mean is TEMPO . I calculated the speed ( tempo ) and found out that there are minimal differences . Actual it is very obvious . Original piano track ( part of Bohemian Rhapsody multitrack ) is little faster than the piano track of the ACTUAL song . Actual song is about 3 to 4 seconds longer than the duration of original piano track ( part of multi track ) . It looks like there were two piano tracks but I doubt because in the documentary also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the documentary there was the piano track that was part of the multitrack ( the faster piano track than piano track of the actual song ) . <p> My only explanation is that original piano track ( part of multitrack ) was afterwards slowed down when they recorded the song and I have no idea why would they do this . It would also mean slightly lower pitch in the actual song ( few cents ) . <p> It 's quite interesting and I had n't noticed that before , but it makes sense . It could 've been slowed down slightly , for whichever reason . That 's the sort of thing interviewers and researched could spend some time on , rather than just trying to discover who Freddie was dating at the time and whether he was faithful to him/her or not . <p> If the piano track is slowed down , then bass and drums tracks must also be slowed down since all three were recorded live , meaning all at the same time . After that all the other layers were added ( vocals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everyone ( i think ) knows , Another One Bites The Dust is speeded up . The original ( before mixing it to the single/album version we all know ) is slower . In this case , following the same idea , if the multitrack leaked we would ear the song in it 's original speed . Want a taste of it ? Hear Wyclef Jean feat . Pras &amp; Free remix of the song . <p> My theory . We know that Freddie was an amazing rhythm piano player and normally did n't need metronome for recording piano track . To my opinion there are 3 evidences that he did n't use metronome in Boh Rhap piano track : - Brian tells this in the documentary ( the one posted by popy ) - beginning ( intro ) has a little bit of rubato on some parts - if you calculate the exact tempo of the ballad piano track ( which has 100 % steady rhythm , no rubato ) you will get about 71,48 BPM . Not a round number that would be played with metronome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic for other instruments . If Brian for instance wanted to record guitar track and use a metronome he would most likely want to have round BPM number like 71 instead of 71,48 . Maybe this is the reason they slowed down piano track when final recording of the song . <p> Of course I can not say as I did n't check the tempo of original guitar track . It is just a thought . <p> I do n't want to be a party pooper , and do n't take all the next thing offensive in any way , but since texts ca n't express emotions it can be read as harsh , agressive or boaster , that 's not my intention . To remember you that , I 'll put a smiley face at the ending of every paragraph . : ) <p> It 's exactly the same piano take . The whole song 's speed ( tempo+pitch ) was lowered down . Just check another similar examples like ' You and I ' , SSoR , TYMD , ' Dancer ' , ' Teo Torriate ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity , check every song that you have access to the multitracks and compare it to the original one , even ' One Vision ' is in a different speed . : ) <p> You have the opposite too : - ' Staying Power ' , ' Cool Cat ' , DSMN- or ' Long Away ' are speeded up to a tempo which makes them to be in an impossible to play tune . LA 's first note is between G# and A , but it 's not any of those . In this case , they were speeded up to gain strenght , and when you speed up a song you can do it up to 1/4 note without noticing squirrel pitch changes . Check AOBtD or- ' Hijack My Heart ' , it was speeded up to 1/2 note , and you can notice Roger 's squirrel voice. - : ) <p> Now , It could be an artistic decission ( which I think that is ) or it could be an issue with the technology at the time .

Compare the last choruses with the first ones . But I do n't think that has something to do with BoRhap and rounded tempos . I 've been working remixing the whole AKoM , every single song has metronome , but none of them are in a rounded tempo . Some of them also slips from the metronome tempo at some point ( copying , cutting and joining tapes ? ) . The same with ' The Miracle ' or ' Innuendo ' albums. - : ) <p> Check the next audio fragment , comparing the " Operistic Section " on the left with the original part on the right . I 've placed both exactly at the same start point , but you 'll notice that the left one is faster , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks C Matt.I thought simple metronomes from 1975 could normally only click on the round numbers and that 's why I thought it was slowed down to 71 BPM ( I checked and the actual song has a ballad speed of exact 71 BPM ) for other instruments . <p> I guess it is an artistic decision . Someone with Mozart pitch would probably hear lower pitch of piano in actual song . <p> And yes you have a very good point about slip from the metronome tempo . I also discovered this situation . How Can I Go On is also one of those songs . But you can hardly notice . I guess music ( rhythm ) really does n't need to be mathematically 100 % accurate . <p> I think it-s great that Queen don-t work around a metronome . It keeps things fresh and interesting , and it allows the song to " breath " and grow . I think it-s a strenght ! But i remember that people used to slam Roger Taylor in the past because of this . Even the maestro Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is , when the song reaches the final it has become " more " than it was before . Like a living organism , and Queen are one of the very few artists who understand this concept . That-s why a Queen song is allways growing with every tour . It becomes more along with it-s creators . and this concept is not understood by every classical musician either . Here it is an expert of a Maria Jo+o Pires masterclass ( she is one of the greatest Mozart and Chopin interpreters of our time on piano ) . <p> The part that matters is on 4:35 , but if you are a musician or just a listener there are many things here that will open your mind when listening to music . Listen to what she tries to explain to the student . and then realize why Brian May is a genius of phrasing : <p> Now , on this topic i only say that it appears to me that it was an artistic decision , and could have only be made with Freddie-s aproval . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the impression that Brian wasn-t aware that it was speded up , when he was working on " The game " dvd . I find it hard to believe that no one noticed . <p> But with Boh Rhap , Freddie would definetely catch it if it was a mistake . I remember that when Freddie lip-synched his performance of " How can i go on " with Montsy , he new right away that the song was played at the wrong speed , even if minimal by peoples standarts . By 1980 he may not gave a shit anymore but in 75 he was pretty much on top of everything . <p> I somehow tend to agree it is artistic reason , but on the other hand I am asking myself what is the point of changing the tempo for such a small amount of speed : three seconds are completely unnoticed in the whole song that is almost 6 minutes long . You simply do n't achieve any different effect for the listener . You will never hear the difference unless you are timing the song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . <p> Weirdly I noticed this the other day while doing some remixing .

@@6701950 <p> In the Lap of the Gods is less so a prelude to Bohemian Rhapsody than My Fairy King and March of the Black Queen . It does , however , have distinct sections ( albeit only two ) .

Bush is trying to have Congress DO AWAY with that Tax Credit , making it MUCH harder to own a home , which not only is obviously safer and better for a homeowner as oppsed to a renter , but , it 's GOOD for the ECONOMY when people have more ability and incentives to buy a home .

@@6701965 <p> I own the Brian May Red Special Pedal great : ) lots of fun etc but I have a question regarding exactly what I should be doing with it . <p> My confusion is as follows : Does the pedal its self imitate the sound of Brian May 's rig inclusive of the AC-30s etc OR does it provide the appropriate drive to push the AC-30s or other amps INTO his sound when cranked ? <p> Does that make sense ? <p> In other words , if i played the pedal through a clean amp or just into some PA , will I get his sound ? or do I have to play it through an AC-30 cranked to the max ? <p> Yes , it makes sence : - ) ' Cranking ' up the amplifier is always good for the sound . But this pedal is SUPPOSED to be able to stand alone . As a matter of fact Digitech specifically says that you should put the amplifier to ' as clean as possible ' . <p> The pedal SHOULD simulate Brian 's guitar , effects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar and/or a different amp certainly is NOT beneficial for the majority of the sounds . <p> The sounds you get with a different amp are still nice and interesting , but FAR from sounding ' like Brian ' . Yes , the idea is there - but it will never be the same . <p> My experience with different amps and/or guitars is for example that KYA sounds VERY good on anything - but TYMD absolutely SUCKS at anything other then BM Guitar + ac30 . It does n't even come close to the sound it is supposed to make . The others are all somewhere in between . <p> My advice would be to get a great keyboard amp and put it through that . Clean and brilliant for modelling stuff . Or , if you have the ability , a mini-PA of your own . It has been done ! The Roland VG8 was such a big thing that people did that . <p> Yes , you 're right Adam . The pedal is not ideal for ' live ' playing ( but it is not intented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as it is for recording and playing around with in ' studio ' kinda envirements . <p> Actually I 'm already a bit bored with the pedal ; - ) ) ) I already ' released ' the pedal from my regular set-up in favour of a combination with the Vox Deacy ( booster ) and my own effects . ( Flange , chorus , delay etc ) I get better sounds with my own stuff then from this . The only feature of the pedal that I WILL still utilise is the harmonizer/pitch-shifter , because I do n't have that in a seperate pedal . ( although in all honesty I am not too satisfied with that one either . Or am I doing something wrong ? My individual shifted notes always get slightly distorted ... ? ) <p> EDIT : Thanks for the link , Adam . I think they are right . All in all the pedal is a nice gimmick , something funny to fool around with . But surely not good enough to do something ' pro ' with it . ( All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian 's sound is all about ' acoustics ' , warmth etc . <p> Also what still annoys me : I do n't get the ' stereo ' option to work properly on a stereo amp . Take for instance the Brighton Rock setting . Now , if I hook the pedal up to a stereo-amp instead of two seperate amps , It ca n't get the signal to divide and spread over two channels . It 's still mono ! Any idea ? <p> Yes you are an idiot , that 's what . I 'm a guitarist and the pedal is fine . Perhaps learn how to use the pedal correctly before saying it sucks . <p> Just because someone does n't like the pedal is no reason to insult them . Some people do n't like it and have their reasons for it . So , do n't say such things cause it just makes you look bad . <p> I 'm a guitarist , too . I personally think myself and others on this board have looked into this pedal and feel it 's probably good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality setup . And as demonstrated in our big Digitech ( good or not ) thread , it was also evident that some people sound great , while others sound nowhere near as good . And it did n't have anything to do with skill or bad recordings . It just did n't cut it with some people . Very interesting , that . Especially the Guitarist sound samples that came off worse than the sound someone posted on that RedSpecial forum . That 's what I 'm getting at . <p> And heck , we 're all about informing people here . Not just saying , it 's great and you 're just shit with it . Why not bloody suggest how it can sound as good as you think it should . <p> Yes but for Jerone just to criticise brian mays pedal like that , saying it was crap is not called for . If it was crap it would n't have been endorsed by brian , so yes i think jerone needs to get what he says correct . <p> " Yes but for Jerone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was crap is not called for . " <p> To be fair on Jeroen ( and maybe I misread him ) I do n't think he ever called it crap . I think that a lot of us have come across our own setups over the years that make us happy - that give us the sound we 're after . It 's only natural some people will be happier with their own setup than with the pedal . <p> " If it was crap it would n't have been endorsed by brian " <p> 5ive . <p> " I listen to brian . " <p> I do too ! I figure I should listen to other people as well - in fact , listen to every guitarists opinion , because we 've all got our own way of doing it , and much can be learned from discussing . <p> I personally do n't find myself that excited by most of the pedals effects , but I like the Deacy sound and the orchestration one , I 've heard good things done with them .

Their vocal harmonies are tight , with Play The Game being a notable mention . <p> Freddie notes that it 's " Fucking freezing in this auditorium " before Mustapha . " Especially for all those people in the back . But we 'll get your asses on fire in a minute , do n't worry . " Before Love Of My Life , Brian mentions the temperature too , however a wee bit more diplomatically than Freddie as per usual . " Well , I hope you 're all warming up a little by now . It feels like it . " <p> There are a few great adlibs from Freddie . In Killer Queen , he sings , " Perfume came naturally from Wembley , " something which he had done many times in the past at various places around the world ( London and Tokyo , at least ) . And later , there is his " Ride on cowboy , any way you like , on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flash Gordon movie during Flash , " Oh Flash , I love you , I love you , I love you ! " and " You can save the world " between verses of The Hero . <p> Freddie has a few little exchanges with audience members tonight . Before Save Me , it sounds like he says , " What did you say in belching ? I 'll turn you into a frog if you do n't watch it . " Before Fat Bottomed Girls , he contemplates the next song in the setlist , and tells himself , " We 're gon na do that one , yes , " and then shouts , " You shut up ! You keep out of this ! " After a brief pause , he continues . " We 're gon na do as he says , by the way . This is a dirty little number , and we 've uh ... " He gets distracted again and says , " You shut up as well .

After he ( unusually ) sings the final " rockin ' world go ' round " like the record version , Roger shouts " Woooo ! " in excitement . <p> About 2 1/2 minutes into Brian 's guitar solo , there is a beautiful moment . His choice of notes and rhythms in his ascending and descending run sound very classical , and he probably did n't even realize it on the fly . Thank goodness for tape ! A bit later , you can hear Brian fiddling with his delay unit to get the right timing before entering Battle Theme . <p> The Flash Gordon soundtrack was released today , which means their audiences did n't know Battle Theme and The Hero when they had been performed at earlier shows on the European tour . <p> Tonight would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed Flash for the first time two nights before in Birmingham , with Brian playing the rhythm on his guitar . The band then decided it was best to have him on the keyboard instead , to be closer to the record version ( probably a 3-1 decision in the band democracy ! ) . As seen on the Buenos Aires video from the following year , Brian switches from the piano to the synth patch the old-fashioned way - by manually pushing a button , instead of a foot pedal . <p> Like two nights ago , Queen swapped the encores . Freddie and Roger 's voices blend perfectly in the second verse of Sheer Heart Attack . At the end of the show , after thanking the audience , Freddie adds , " Hey , we can all go home now and get fucked ! " <p> Queen dropped Need Your Loving Tonight from the setlist after this show for some reason . It would be played now and again in 1981 , usually alternating nights with Rock It . <p> Here 's an upgrade of the Frankfurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider stereo sound , but this is definitely the lowest generation copy I 've heard yet ( a friend of mine traded for the tape from a German collector in 1984 ) . This is a great , energetic show from the boys . Listen to Brian mess up on the piano at the beginning of Save Me . It takes a few seconds for he and Freddie to synch together again . This is probably the best recording of Queen 's rendition of Imagine we 'll ever hear . This is also one of the best recordings of Battle Theme . It did n't last long in their live set , as they dropped it after the Japanese ' 81 shows . <p> I 've also added God Save The Queen is from from the " Imagine " bootleg on the Gypsy Eye label .

@@6701974 <p> I 've really been listening to this song throughout all the tours ( The Game through the Magic Tours ) , and I was wondering what is the best version of the song live ( overall ) ? Here 's some nominees ( chronological order ) : <p> New York ( 9/28/1980 ) : Freddie nails the whole first verse and chorus like the record ( the phrasing ) <p> Brussels ( 12/13/1980 ) : Freddie nails all the B4s in the song--and is one of the few versions where he does album phrasing on the chorus ( he sings Another One Bites The Dust on G4 , A4 , B4--like a stair-step ) . <p> Knebworth ... no contest. - Freddie could never do the vocal line justice live ( although sometimes he came close , as Greg has so thoroughly researched ) , so adding the crowd singalong was perfect for the song and the setting of the tour. - And there was something magical about this last version ... it 's just so musical in every way . @qwx43797 <p> Bob : I totally disagree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the best version . He gets every note perfectly and cleanly with amazing precision . Plus it has a good improv as well . I 've never heard any version where he sings it like that .

They have awesome improv sections . The way I judge best versions ( you can hear this on the Skype debates ) , is by a criteria ( not in order ) : <p> I do n't like montreal version , it sounds overdubbed a lot , i mean in some parts you can actually hear two freddie voices together , at least that 's what i hear . I mean he 's in great shape , but the part " hey gon na get you too another one bites the dust " sounds clearly overdubbed/effected . <p> I 'm listening to the parts you mentioned .

Listen to the audience recording from the other night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said best performances of songs are not about just what Freddie hits . The reason why I think Montreal has the best version is because the whole song itself sounds great and it is one of the only versions I 've heard where Freddie hits all the B4 's perfectly with such precision . Sure the magic tour versions are classic but this version I have to say has the best vocal performance. - <p> And no I do n't judge based solely off of what Freddie hits . If I went off that note , I 'd love the game tour over the Opera tour ! ( which i obviously do n't ) . 
@@6701975 <p> Well I have taken the plunge and purchased the new remastered releases and Deep Cuts Volume 1 and I must say that overall I am pleased with the remastering and the snippets on the bonus discs . I have n't had chance to listen to them all yet in detail but I must say that the first album in particular sounds great , and an improvement to the excellent Hollywood release of 91 . The backing vocals on GKR and TNCD in particular are a fantastic improvement . <p> The highlights for me of the bonus tracks is the extended ending to SSOR , the acapella of BBTLB and the truly spectacular live rendition of YTMBA from Hyde Park . Running through the Deep Cuts album I was dissapointed that Tenement Funster / Flick Of The Wrist / Lilly of The Valley are not the stand alone versions but as they appear on SHA . Lily of The Valley track starts again with ' baby you 've been had ' from FOTW ! ! ! <p> Surprise of the day was the ending to MOTBQ on Deep cuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the soaring backing vocals outro as appears here ... very nicely done . Ogre Battle also benefits from an extended gong outro and again , not fading in to the Fairy Feller . <p> Do I regret buying these ... not judging by the first listen . These are an improvement on what has come before forgetting the DTS mix of ANATO . I hope and pray that one day we will have 5.1 mixes of all the albums ... dream on ! ! <p> " The March Of The Black Queen " and " Ogre Battle " were the two most significant reasons I 'd buy Deep Cuts ( that and my completist nature would n't ever let me not buy it at some point ) . It 's great to know that some care went into these two tracks being proper stand-alone , non-segued versions . A fadeout would have been the bare minimum of- acceptability , but " clean " single tracks is almost more than I ever hoped for or expected . <p> I have to wait till May to get my copy , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to look forward to in addition to the Deluxe Editions . <p> Yes the end of MOTBQ sounds tacked on . Very disappointing . There must be a master tape of the original ending somewhere . However I 'm quite pleased with the end of OB . The SHA trilogy , though - very sloppy . <p> Well I have read the comments on this thread and have revisited the MOTBQ ending many times . I think I may have been still in shock of hearing a stand alone version when I left my initial charitable comment ! Maybe a better way to have described it would have been to say , nice idea , poorly executed ! <p> I think part of the problem is n't that the vocals sound tacked on , I do n't believe they are or that any editing was done them after 1973 , let alone for this collection . What is jarring is the fact that the instruments cut out at the end , which I think are only drums and piano in that last 2 seconds . They simple vanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to say if that 's how they appear on the master , but I think that 's what 's throwing people off , the piano note underneath being cut off . <p> Also , our ears expect to hear one more note , too , under the highest " AHHH " s at the end , and without it , it sounds weird . On the album , that note is achieved with the first note of FHLI , which comes in right there . Here , though , we 're left sort of hanging , waiting for a note that does n't come , and the vocal then sound unsupported , like they 're left dangling . <p> rhyeking wrote : I think part of the problem is n't that the vocals sound tacked on , I do n't believe they are or that any editing was done them after 1973 , let alone for this collection . That is definitely an edit done especially for this compilation - that is a digital edit , not analogue . <p> They will have taken Ludwig 's new remaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( easily done - Justin Shirley Smith etc have access to all their digital transfers of multitracks ) . Shove those 2 stereo tracks- into Audition , mute the backing vocal track until the last bit , fade out what you do n't want on the finished remaster and bob 's your uncle . Does n't cost anything to do . <p> I 'm sure there 's no way you could actually have known this , but Bob is , in fact , the name of one of my uncles . I 'm not kidding . : - ) - I know it 's a another saying for " and there you go ! " , but since it 's true in my case , it 's always funny when people say that . <p> As for whether they remixed the ending ... ( shrug ) <p> I still think the reason it bugs people is the aforementioned dropout of the instruments . It would sound nicer for that last 1st beat to appear with a piano note , to punctuate the vocals . Most popular music in 4/4 time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> Honestly , and I know this is a point of contention , so do n't bite my head off for disagreeing , I do n't think any remixing was done . I think the master drops out the way we hear it and that 's what we get . <p> IF ( and I emphasis that ) that is the case , what would you have them do ? Should they have added or remixed to make it sound " better " ? I 'd rather have to the raw track , warts and all , rather than having them " fix " it . I 'm also glad they did n't just fade out on the FHLI intro . This is something unique and , to my ear , is as it was on the master . <p> Lastly , why re-invent the wheel , so to speak ? Why go to the trouble to remix the end ( assuming those who believe it are correct ) when the master would have the complete , uncut performance and that could simply be transfered over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tenement Funster , " and " Flick Of The Wrist , " and " Lily Of The Valley " and " Funny How Love Is " ) ? <p> Call me naive or whatever , but I do n't believe there is remixing here . If there is , I still enjoy the end result , hence my shrug . I hope no one took that as indifference to others ' opinions . I have enjoyed this dialogue and respect the other thoughts expressed . I will keep it in mind . <p> Has anyone already tried to merge this version with the unique Funny How Love Is standalone from a 3 " cd-single ( which runs 2:52 min ) . Can not recall where this version can be found , but I think it was the German or Japanese 3 " cd-single set . <p> If they merge perfectly and sound like the ones on Queen II , then you know that the TMOTBQ edit was done correctly .. or not ? <p> Not sure where this discussion is going . It 's nothing to do with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage mix - it 's so obvious from listening to it . Comparing it to a standalone mix of FHLI is does n't prove or disprove anything - we 're talking about them taking an instrumental vocal mix and basically pasting it onto the end .... the actual vocal is n't going to sound any different to the album version if mixed appropriately , it just wo n't have any instrumentation beneath it therefore creating a clean ending . <p> I 'm sure vintage stand alone mixes existed for every track they 've produced - that does n't mean they still have them or if they do , that they utilized them . Why did they originally use the album version of Tenement Funster on Queens ' First EP etc etc ? Do you think they dug out a stand alone mix and also got Ludwig to remaster it just for this compilation ? No chance . <p> If you believe it 's a fully original stand alone version of the track - it 's fine . Honestly ! lol But it quite clearly IS N'T . <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the clean version of FHLI is added at the correct point , does that not prove it was neither remixed nor pasted on ? If it were remixed , it would sound different . If it were pasted , it would sound edited , even with FHLI . <p> No , having done this test , I 'm convinced this is likely how it appears on the master . <p> With one exception . It 's possible the original performance had Freddie and Roger continue playing after the point their instruments are dropped out of the album mix . However , as that was not part of the track , nor intended to be , so removing it is faithful to the original . <p> I honestly feel what we have is a case of our ears playing tricks on us . The instruments vanishing leaves us to hear the last vocal part all by itself , which we have not heard that way before , as FHLI 's intro is there on the album . Unsupported , the vocals sound weird . <p> Anyway , I 'm repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yes it is , " " no it 's not , " so I 'm going to leave this thread alone for a while , unless something new comes up . It is fun discussing this stuff , though . <p> I have to wait till May to get my copy , living in Canada , but it 's good to have another thing to look forward to in addition to the Deluxe Editions . LONG ... <p> Rhye , I , too , am from Canada . If you 're waiting to get the deluxe editions over here , you may as well get them from Amazon.co.uk , as it is a cheaper alternative to getting it at any HMV , Futureshop , Best Buy or even amazon.ca .... With shipping , each set will cost less than 20$CDN ( no tax ) - when they release them here , it may go for as much as 29.99+tax depending where in Canada you live . Remember , - 2 versions will be- available- - a standard and a " deluxe " - standard will likely start at 14.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky ) . <p> In the UK - they do n't seem to charge that much more for a double or triple disc set ( for deluxe albums ) - pricing seems to be set at the price of an album ( 8-9 pounds ) plus cost to produce the additional disc ( s ) . In Canada and the US , we normally price per disc included in the set , regardless of whether it 's a deluxe version , double disc album , or a box set. - <p> To avoid any customs charges - duty , brokerage , etc ... keep each order a relatively low amount before shipping - normally any order @ 50$ once converted into CDN ( roughly 30 pounds ) or less , will stay below the radar . So do n't buy any more than 3 at a time . <p> You 'll get it sooner and for less . <p> But for deep cuts , GH1 and GH2 ( if you plan to get those 2 for completion purposes ) may come to less if you wait for it over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as what the deluxe versions go for ) . <p> I believe Rhyeking is correct in MOTBQ . If I dropped out instruments from my mix of a song to leave only a set of vocals like that at the end , it may very well sound tacked on . However , in context with all the instrumentation , it will always sound far more pleasing to the ear. - Also , having listened to the Deep Cuts mix , it sounds perfectly natural .

This should end up being the ultimate reference for Queen ' songs ' , but it 's gon na need a lot of collaboration and improvement before it fulfills its potential . <p> There are lots of areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main ones being the ' tone ' that the articles are written in . Some of it just does n't sound professional or academic enough for the subject matter at hand . But I ca n't really be bothered to list all the thoughts I had when reading the analysis . <p> But I do have to say , as GUMP touched on , that I 'm sure some of the harmony you have is fairly off . Certainly in the very opening section , the chords are not all minor ; I 'm sure there 's a dim7 , and a half-dim , and possibly even a major chord in there somewhere . <p> I 'm not at home now , so ca n't check , but off the top of my head I 'm sure that opening progression is more like : <p> F#m7b5 - G - Gdim7 ( or maybe Gm7b5 ) - Am - Dm . <p> You have that Dm as a Dm6 , which it most definitely is n't ( at least in the piano part ) as Fred does n't play a B-natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Cmajor chord , before going to , and fluctuating around , some kind of Cdim/Ebdim chord if I remember rightly . <p> I get a bit confused about what you 're doing in Phrase D. As far as I 'm concerned , the sequence Ebdim/B - Ebdim/A - Ebdim/B - Ebdim/A does n't occur anywhere in the whole song . The Ebdim part is about right , but I do n't know where you got the bass-notes from . <p> The Bbm chord in that section is not entirely correct , as the chords again fluctuate around some form of Bbdim , rather than staying on a simple Bbm . <p> Phrase E is surely wrong too . I 'm sure the harmony progresses up a Dim7 chord in Dim7s , ie it goes : <p> Bbdim7 - Dbdim7 - Edim7 - Gdim7 . <p> Phrase F again is wrong , as the piano chords alternate between G and ( I 'm pretty sure ) Gm7b5 , rather than the simple Gm you have . <p> Would it not be simpler to label the chord at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , but is n't there another repeat of the Gm7 - C in that section , or at least just the Gm , that you seem to have missed ? <p> I 'll try and have a better look at this when I 'm at home with my piano and the CD , but although this is all from my head right now , I 'm pretty confident in all I 've said . <p> Anyway , hope this helps and keep up the good work on your excellent site . <p> Gullibility and credulity are considered undesirable qualities in every department of human life -- except religion . <p> More than that I want to make the right frame more useful . Right now its completely pointless <p> &gt; and make the top of the page ( the title ) a bit smaller . <p> You 're right <p> &gt; I do think , however , that there may be some inaccuracies among your musical notation <p> This is possible indeed since its hard to transcribe chords for the intro . So any help is well received .

Thats adisadvantage of written language , you ca n't sense the tone , although I should find better synonims or something to make it less " strong " . Thanks <p> &gt; you might re-word the part saying " Very technically skilled piano fast arpeggios were played by Mercury in the intro " . Because it 's Mercury who is skilled , and not the arpeggios , I 'd suggest " Very technically demanding , fast piano arpeggios in the intro were skillfully played by Mercury " , or something similar . <p> Yes , you 're right about that .

I have n't found the formula for a good precise short clear but deep essay yet . <p> &gt; I 'm sure some of the harmony you have is fairly off . <p> Another reason why I bring it to the forum <p> &gt;F#m7b5 - G - Gdim7 ( or maybe Gm7b5 ) - Am - Dm . <p> That 's very interesting , and changes seeral details of the article .

Its not so much a bass note but its the lowest one . First B then A. But as I 'm not a " consumated " transcriber , I cant make a sure conclusion .

The answer depends on whether you 're using Classical or Jazz/Pop chord analysis . I studied Classical music in college , so that 's the way my brain ( and ear ) is programmed . Hopefully , someone else will respond who has mastered chord naming from the Jazz/Pop realm . <p> I 'm also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bb " , which I ca n't verify with an instrument right now ( soon , though ) , so I 'm only analyzing what I 'm reading here , not necessarily what I 'm hearing ... i.e. disclaimer . ( If the rest of your analysis is correct , I consider it quite unlikely that Freddie &amp; Roger are holding notes 1/2 step away from each other - that 's a very difficult dissonance to pull off ... not saying it 's not possible for them , nor that it 's not true in this case , just unlikely , I guess , until I can verify . I swear I 'll take a stand on this as soon as I unpack the keyboard . ) For now I 'll just use your info . <p> In the Classical world of musical analysis , the 6th chord does n't exist . If a Bb note is introduced as an addition to a dm chord triad ( Bb-D-F-A ) , it is then called a BbMaj7 or BbM7 , since a Bb is spelled a third below the D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if the Bb is the bass note or not - the D and F reinforce the overtones of the Bb Major triad and we hear it " take over " as the chord 's root . The " A " is then considered the dissonance , the " major 7th " interval from the Bb , which would need resolution by melodic movement . <p> In the Jazz/Pop realm , I think , it might matter if the note is in the bass . I 'm not qualified to say , so ... Help !

But being that Rog and Bri were in SMILE ... one would assume that even if its not heavily public ... they were all great buds , <p> I never really paid much attention to this but I 've never read anything to suggest John and Fred were like brothers or even that close ( i.e. a relationship deeper than being in a band together , with all that entails ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their career , and there- are some stories of Fred taking John under his wing a bit because he wanted him to feel a part of the band , - but it 's hard to imagine them being very close . And while a lot of these things become a blur after a while , I 'm pretty sure I read somewhere that John was uncomfortable with some aspects of Fred 's behaviour . You have to remember also that over the course of 30-40 years people change a lot and so do relationships , so it 's quite probable there is no one " relationship " between any of the band members , just a series of evolving relationships depending on each 's personal circumstances . For example , I get the impression that Brian and Rog- were close in the early days , drifted apart a bit when Roger became interested in New Wave music , but now they 're closer than ever . Or that could be nonsense . There 's no way to know for sure without being close to the band . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be a footballing minnow . Instead , they could be better described as the piranhas of the international game " ( FIFA.com ) <p> There are elements of truth in this thread , but in the end there will always be plenty that we wo n't know. - I get the general sense that they were n't exceptionally close to one another ( save perhaps for Roger and Freddie ) , especially by the 80s when it became more of a business relationship. - John griped about that even after the success of Live Aid. - They bonded after Freddie revealed his illness , and that 's probably when they were the closest . <p> In 93/94 , Brian and Roger apparently were n't speaking. - John and Roger started Made In Heaven without Brian. - There 's an interview from 1993 where Roger has some not-too-cheerful things to say about Brian. - But they clearly made up , and since No-One But You it seems like John has n't spoken much to Bri and Rog . <p> About a month ago , someone asked Brian for John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded with something like , " I have n't even spoken with him in years . " @qwx43797 <p> Brian/Roger -oldest friends from smile- and both the real true rockers although it is clear they used to fight like brothers . musically i think they both liked the more heavy stuff . They continue to fly the flag but their work with AL , RW , 5ive and pepsi embarass me . Brian/Freddie- Main songwriters in early days but suspect they differed on music greatly from The Game onwards . John and Paul Prenter could have killed Queen with their rock/metal fans after Hot Space basically wanting to have no guitars ! Brian/John- Musically they were poles apart . John more into pop/funk , Brian into metal/aor . I suspect John looked at Freddie as an ally musically although i suspect Fred liked a wider range of music despite writing a lot of pop/dance crap from 1980 onwards . I suspect now they not even on speaking terms Roger/Fred- worked on the market together , both party animals , musically I think Roger looked up to Fred but did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff too ) he was more into hard rock as was Fred too at times before he got involved in gay disco pop sounds . It is rumoured that RT is only person who knows the real meaning of Bo Rhap , suggests they were quite close but not that close if you know what i mean ... ; ) Fred/John- From- AOBTD Fred and John seemed to be responsible for poppier numbers which I hate . FWBF , - OYOL , - huge parts of Hot Space etc , I hate all that stuff and it was these two who pushed Queen away from their 70 's rock/metal original- fans but i suppose they got new pop fans in the 80 's too. - - I have read that John was disgusted by lots of fred 's antics but musically in the 80 's they were both- looking to take Queen more into gay dance sounding- stuff , although Fred would still pen heavy stuff too , ( hitman , princes ) John basically did not seem to be into that stuff at all except iycbt off jazz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the 80 's they socialised a bit family skiing trips etc , although musically i think they had very different views , - maybe because they were not the ' main songwriters in the early days . They- seemed close when fm died but then post MIH- i suspect there is a falling out and privately not much love lost between them today . i can understand some of jd 's reluctance seeing some of the Queen + work ( PR aside which was excellent ) . However , i do feel john has showed a lot of contempt towards the fans , no interviews , no appearances yet still taking the royalties , i 'd be pissed with him too if i was RT/BM . <p> It 's not like John owes the fans anything , as he chose to retire , just like anyone at any job. - But in the music business there is still a price to pay , as evidenced in the recent Days Of Our Lives documentary. - It 's not like they wrote him out completely , but his roles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was even a bit of revisionist history in there , suggesting that John was barely involved with Made In Heaven. - But that 's the price of admission. - Or leaving , in his case . @qwx43797 <p> From a cosmic perspective , the universe pushed these 4 together to do the amazing things they did. - That is something too powerful to have lasting differences - so I basically wish John could talk to them . Who wins with things this way ? <p> When you hear and read about Queen 's carreer , it never looked like you are dealing with four good friends - there seemed to have been rows and fights from day 1 until the time when Freddie came out about his AIDS condition to the band . Fans seem to have a desire to believe that their favourite band is a group of close buddies who make it against the odds but I do not believe that was the case with Queen . I think that Freddie always was totally honest about that : why kill the goose that laid the golden eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of them were much too intelligent to let personal animosities come into their ways . Certainly Roger and Brian were good friends in the early days and Roger and Freddie seem to have been good friends until Freddie 's death but I would not be surprised if John would have had a problem with Freddie 's lifestyle and Brian surely must have had some resentments against John 's anti-guitar politics in the 1980s . Many problems were carefully hidden from the public - for example Paul Prenter was never even mentioned by any Queen representative until the recent DOOL documentary . <p> About John 's alleged " contempt " towards the fans - I wonder if people ever consider that John Deacon might have very good reasons to distance himself from the band - apparently he already distanced himself from the band as early as the late 80s . After all , he never came into Brian 's and Roger 's way and signed off all their projects after Freddie 's death . Let us not forget that he could have vetoed away everything . Brian and Roger have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imo . The band was finished after Freddie died - Brian and Roger have no right to expect John Deacon to take part in their money-making machine - just my opinion . <p> Regarding John I simply think that the whole rock career was a bit of an accident which he never fully enjoyed . Freddie , Brian and Roger all wanted to be stars while John just wanted to be in play in a band for a while . <p> This might add a little insight to how things " might " be between Brian and John these days . This is from this months Classic Rock mag . <p> Brian was asked <p> " When did you last go round to John Deacon 's house for a meal ? " <p> His reply <p> " A very long time ago . I see John 's offspring , but John prefers to stay away . And we respect that completely . We have this agreement where we leave each other alone " <p> On the one hand I think , ok John really does just want to have peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agreement " . But then , on the other hand , and coupled with Roger 's comment on the Jo Whiley show about John coming back from Bali " looking like he was on mushrooms - he was a strange one " , I think all is maybe not that well between them . I hope its the latter though ...... <p> " Normally i ca n't dance to save my life . <p> But as soon as I step in dog shit , I can moonwalk better than Michael Jackson . " <p> In 93/94 , Brian and Roger apparently were n't speaking. - John and Roger started Made In Heaven without Brian. - There 's an interview from 1993 where Roger has some not-too-cheerful things to say about Brian. - <p> Brian wrote in 2003 that Freddie wrote Soul Brother for him. - So Brian &amp; Freddie obviously had a good relationship. - Brian said in the 90 's that Freddie was like a brother to him. - As for John , he is always welcome to come back to the band if he ever chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating together they must have been very very close as in being able to anticipate each other 's thoughts and reactions . - So in this sense they would probably be closer to each other than a friend . - We tend to show our best sides to friends but they would have experienced it all together - the challenges , frustrations , anguish , thrills , success , stress , etc . <p> Is only my opinion after doing a lot of interviews to a lot of Queen 's world ( Justin Shirley-Smith , Mack , Mike Moran , Roger , etc ... ) <p> Brian and Freddie were no closer friends , only friends in the last couple of years . They respected each other , no more . John and Freddie were the godfathers of Mac 's children . Roger and Freddie were the best friends in the band . Roger and Brian had a love/hate relationship . John went well with Roger , and he felt very close to Freddie because of Freddie 's protection and helped him to did more songs .

And it was n't what you would call a " maistream party " . <p> Also remember reading how one visited the others home as young lads , and get excited with the stereo effects of their favourites music .

It does have the characteristic look of re-coloured footage though .

@@6702024 <p> Has anyone listened to this tribute album ? I think I 've seen it mentioned only once in this forum . <p> Here 's a link to a YouTube playlist : LONG ... <p> It was recorded live during a " goodbye " show from a band called Evil Bebos , where they played a bunch of Black Sabbath covers . The Protomen said they wanted to do something " equally badass " so they played a bunch of Queen covers . <p> I think it came out quite impressive . The Protomen have a lot more members than Queen ( they 're 9 people ) so they had more people to do stuff that Queen would n't do live ( the guitar harmonies in Killer Queen for example ) . The lead singer ( Raul Panther ) does a pretty good Freddie impression without sounding like an imitator , even hitting notes you normally would n't hear from live Freddie ( most notably in Under Pressure ) . There 's a few songs that Queen did n't have the opportunity to do live with Freddie too , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think would bother the Queen purists is the use of vocoders and other synths ( mostly because the selection of songs is more derivative of the 80s period ) , which people often cite as something that hurt the Queen sound a bit . I 'm not that bothered because I 'm used to it in The Protomen 's own songs ( it 's actually part of the theme on their original albums ) . <p> Meanwhile , I have the A Night of Queen in my collection , Act I on vinyl , the I Drove all Night cassette single , The Cover Up on cassette tape and vinyl , and have the single for This City Made Us by them pre ordered already . Aha , yeah , I was wondering about this before actually , just never asked on here . <p> Their original stuff is pretty good . It tends to sound more like Journey than Queen to me , though , so I always wonder what a Journey cover album would sound like ( I know they did Separate Ways in a few shows ) . 
@@6702026 <p> A few weeks ago some of you may remember I posted a video mix I did for Do n't Lose Your Head .

@@6702027 <p> One Year of Love has always been a favorite of mine . Although sometimes slagged off by fans as being too sappy , it 's Freddie 's vocal that carried it for me . I never quite cared for the sax solo- a tasteful Brian solo would have clearly topped that . But as I was just thinking about the song , I remembered the Stevie Ann version that knocked me for a loop when I heard it some time ago . Could it be that Queen got it all wrong , and over-produced the song ? I know there is a more subtle version , albeit shorter , in Highlander . But would it have gained a certain cachet if it had been stripped down with just Brian on acoustic and Freddie on vocals and/or piano ? I think it could have been a highlight of the Magic tour- performed just like LOML and Is This the World We Created ? Of course , hindsight is 20/20 , and perhaps the band made the right choice .

This is a nice little ballad , well done by the girl you posted , but Freddie 's screaming at the top of his lungs in parts of the Queen version . I think the best change would have been lowering the key a step or two and let Freddie wrap his voice around it instead of using to test the upper register of his range . <p> For another example , compare the studio version of Spread Your Wings with the Live Killers version .

Who knows , maybe the next tour would have brought it out for the acoustic set , had there been one : ) <p> But I do n't think Queen got anything wrong .. something like this would have seemed rather odd within the AKOM album I think .
