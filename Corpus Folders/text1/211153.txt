Below are pieces from students from , who is a 9th grade student at Shanghai Foreign Language School : <p> Migration is an extremely big topic indeed . The crisis migrants and refugees are confronted with has also become increasingly severe in recent years . <p> During the two-day conference , we listened to and communicated with many prestigious experts to obtain a better and more overall understanding of this topic . We also actively engaged ourselves in debates , sharing ideas with students from all over the world with different political , cultural , and religious background . <p> A bunch of new ideas have been put forward by the speakers in their inspiring speeches .

" We 've always had great teachers , " says Capetandes , " but the development of the program is such that now our students are able to work with some of the best musicians the world has to offer , allowing them to truly dig down deeper into the discipline , master their instruments and learn the finer nuances of expression . " <p> There 's also a lot to be said of the socio-emotional learning that comes along with the program .

This builds not only confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament to the success of the program is its continuation into the high school . Even as the music requirement ebbs after eight grade , roughly 80% continue their studies and lessons , adding further emphasis to UNIS ' focus on folding the arts into the educational experience .

During the preparation concert starting in September 2016 , our strings orchestra faced a number of difficulties . Our repertoire for this concert is challenging given the range of grades and skill levels of our players . The first movement of the New World Symphony , for example , is a piece that I would have never dreamed of playing with a high school orchestra . But with the collaboration among all the players , this piece took shape and sounded better with every rehearsal . It was also heartwarming to see the growing enthusiasm that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to our inspirational conductor Mr. Patricio Diaz .

With more than four months of practices , rehearsals , and collective work , we are finally near the end of our road to Carnegie Hall , and I am beyond excited to present our achievements to our friends , families , and audiences . Shuhan Xie T4 <p> I am very excited to go to Carnegie Hall for the first time and have the privilege to be able to play in such a great ensemble . I am very enthusiastic about the pieces that we will play because they all have a different type of style which makes the music we play so much more well rounded .

I have also learned the importance of practice . Because of violin , I have gotten to know so many different people . I have experienced how it feels to play with a small class of 15 students , and compare this to playing with 100+ other students . Our M4 class has become so close , and we have made so many class jokes .

We are exposed to tragic stories and statistics about people who live in poverty , but reading a statistic is quite different from walking the streets of one . It was during this trip that I was confronted with the truly unbearable living conditions of the Nepali people . <p> In the spring of 2015 , ten students participated in the service learning experience that consisted of four days of teaching at the Sanjeewani Primary School in Nagarkot , a rural village approximately an hour and half from Kathmandu .

They were eager to learn and to interact . In the classroom , they participated in all our activities with great enthusiasm . <p> There was one student in particular who seemed to cling on to me . She has a delicate and warm smile that illuminates her face . Ironically enough , her name is Swastika . We became quite close during my first visit to the school . She was so determined to answer every question in class correctly and always sat at the front . During play time she would grab my hand and tug at my shirt , signaling for a piggy back ride .

They ran into our arms shouting , " Namaste ! Namaste ! " ( Hello , Hello ) as they were surprised to see a familiar faces . Many international students travel to the school throughout the year , but it is rare for a group to return . I was worried when we first arrived because I could not find Swastika .

Not only does it provide a foundation for the student to educate themselves on a certain global issue , but it also works to motivate the student to help change the situation because they better understand it . It is important that all students understand the purpose of this trip . We can not think of it as one unique opportunity and simply move on with our daily lives once we return . The purpose is so that we can continue to help the community in any way we can , even if we are thousands of miles away .

" Come over here and fill your glass , " called Vanessa Go , the junior school 's science teacher and resident environmentalist for the past 15 years . With slight pandemonium , the six and seven-year-olds rushed forward , eager to get their hands on a sample of this special liquid . <p> In fact , it was just water " rain runoff , to be exact " found in strategically placed bins inside the school 's greenhouse . Offset from where their rambunctious peers clamored at recess , the class was there to learn about the inner workings of the space and witness progress in leafy green vegetables and even some small tomatoes . UNIS ' greenhouse is a hydroponic system , where plants are grown without soil , usually leading to higher yields . <p> It might be the most visible sign of UNIS ' commitment to sustainability , but much more is churning inside ( and out ! ) of the school 's busy walls . Categorizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sustainability Integrated Group ( SIG ) . Led by UNIS Trustee Herve Houdre , the group meets monthly to discuss the nearly-exhaustive list of student activities , clubs , projects , and curriculum initiatives that make UNIS an impressive hub of creativity in the field . <p> Ms. Go joined SIG in 2015 as part of the waste management working group , but for years has been actively making her mark on these issues at UNIS . Part of that work has been embedded in the junior school 's Green Team , a group of 20 3rd and 4th graders whose mission is to decrease consumption amongst their peers and the community . " They really see themselves as ambassadors of the environment , " says Go . She notes that these students , who are elected to their position , take their roles very seriously . " We 've set our sights beyond recycling to what it means to actually produce less waste . " A large part of that is incorporating this mindset into the curriculum , through the use of the greenhouse as a classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interact with nature . " Children have this magnetic connection with the Earth ; it 's never too early to get them thinking about how we are a part of it . " <p> Alongside Go and her consumption crusaders are Karen Weissman and Anna L. , also members of SIG as part of the social responsibility working group . The past few months has seen them combing the school to identify the numerous service learning initiatives and activities . The list is impressive . " We have initiatives for a zero-waste cafeteria , students working with their counterparts in Brazil 's favelas , a storytelling unit in the middle school focused on the issue of homelessness in NYC , a theater group and photography project reflecting on incarceration in the United States , and so much more , " says Weissman , an UNIS parent and leader of the Parent Community Service Network , which connects parents across the city to embark on various projects . <p> She 's quick to point out that though her group may not fall into the more green definition of sustainability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

She 's teamed up with fellow UNIS student Marta K. , along with high schoolers from across the city , to share best practices and collaborate on green projects , like the Sustainability Through Student Voices conference , held at the Calhoun School in early April and sponsored by NYSAIS .

" She stresses the importance of a holistic view of sustainability , which was a key theme from the city-wide conference . " Pollution , poverty , public health , development : You ca n't compartmentalize any of the issues of sustainability , which is what I think the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are all about , " she says . <p> Invigorated by the energy and optimism she felt in the aftermath of the conference , Anna plans to take the reins of the Environmental Club next year , with the help of Marta.

These are constantly being reviewed and updated based on current research and best practice recommendations . <p> UNIS continues to work closely with the NYU Langone Medical Center Concussion Center to develop best practice policies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All coaches must take part in professional development programs , which will teach them to understand : <p> Definition , signs and symptoms of concussion . <p> Concussion concerns , complications and at risk populations . <p> Injury prevention . <p> Details of the New York State Concussion Management and Awareness Act . <p> On field concussion assessment and carry over to classroom and play <p> Return to Play and Return to Learn Guidelines . <p> Team composition and the role of the Team in safely assessing and managing the athlete/student who has sustained a concussion . <p> UNIS continues to work closely with the Rapid Response Training LLC to develop best practice policies and procedures in dealing with CPR , Basic First Aid and use of Automatic External Defibrillators ( AED ) . All coaches must take part in professional development programs , which will prepare individuals to provide care for breathing emergencies and perform CPR for victims ( age 8 and up ) of sudden cardiac arrest . Coaches will also learn when and how to use the emergency medical service ( EMS ) . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include broken bones , bleeding , burns , diabetes , seizures , asthma attacks , nose-bleeds and heart attacks . The course will also cover the skills needed to assist a patient with an EPI-Pen Auto Injector and asthma inhaler . <p> UNIS continues to work closely with All Season Sports Orthopedics and Sports Physical Therapy and aims to provide fully qualifies trainers for all UNIS home games . If an athlete sustains a significant injury during a game the therapist and coach will inform the parent/care giver immediately . <p> It is expected that all UNIS athletes provide their own water bottles at all training and games . This policy is based on current research that strongly suggests that the sharing of water bottles between athletes significantly increase the risk of Influenza ( flu ) , colds and other respiratory illness , mononucleosis ( mono ) and meningitis ( infection involving the brain and spinal cord ) . Germs can be spread from saliva when a person with an infection shares a water bottle with another person . <p> It is extremely important that all athletes do bring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to good health and physical activity . Not drinking enough fluids throughout the day can lead to dehydration and decreased performance in activity or sport . Some signs of dehydration include having a strong thirst , dry mouth , decreased amount of urine , and sleepiness ( Thompson , Manore &amp; Sheeshka , 2007 ) . <p> Sport is an invaluable and authentic platform to help teenagers learn more about social and emotional learning . Social and emotional learning ( SEL ) is the development of self-awareness , self-management , social awareness , responsible decision-making , and relationship management . In the context of competitive sports , feelings and emotions that result from achieving a personal best in an event or game , receiving a compliment from a coach or teammate after a meet or game , winning a race or a playoff can make sports extremely enjoyable and motivate teenage athletes to participate regularly . A key challenge in this setting is that young athletes may lack social and emotional competencies that can lead to them becoming less connected with their peers , coach or parents . Negative feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased , failing to achieve a personal best time on the track , living up to the expectations of others , being disqualified in a race or fouled out in a game , or just being isolated from participating in a team activity , can ultimately reduce the desire to participate or continue training and compete , increase anxiety and affect relationships and general well-being . ( Davison 2012 ) <p> It is imperative that coaches , parents , teachers and family and friends continue to support the social and emotional needs all UNIS athletes . It is a shared responsibility . UNIS continues to work closely with the Positive Coaching Alliance ( PCA ) through running workshops and offering on-line training for coaches and athletes . PCA is a national non-profit developing Better Athletes , Better People ' by working to provid eall youth and high school athletes a positive character building youth sports experience .

Click on the Forms section to access the Athletic Release Form and Health Form . You can also contact the Director of Athletics with any questions . <p> Students on teams are required to attend , on average , three events per week . An event is either a practice or game during that particular season . All events are held after school during the week . The first mandatory commitment is a team registration and uniform distribution event . Students will be notified as to when this has been scheduled .

If absenteeism and lateness becomes a consistent problem , their position on the team may be reviewed with the coach , parents or Athletic Director . <p> Every student trying out for a team must bring a separate signed Athlete Release Form to the first day of tryouts . These forms are available on the school web site and relevant links are emailed to the M3 -Tut 4 parents prior to the start of the school year . Students must also bring the appropriate training gear and equipment specific to the sport . If a student is unable to come to one of the tryouts , he/she must inform the coach in order to remain under consideration for the team . In addition , the student must have a health form on file in the nurse 's office .

In order to be accepted and continue on a team , it is important that the student maintains UNIS academic standards ( i.e. no more than one grade lower than 4- in core academic subjects ) throughout the season . A student who falls below this standard , and is therefore placed on academic watch or probation , risks being removed from the team by the Tutorial House principal . Academic review for the fall season participation is based on performance on the June report cards . Participation in the winter season is based on teachers ' affirmation that the student continues to maintain UNIS academic standards . Participation in the spring season will be based on performance on the January report cards . We will also conduct mid-season academic reviews . The Tutorial House principal may also remove an athlete from a team if the school 's behavioral standards are not met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation . Students are responsible for making up all schoolwork missed due to participation in the teams . Each athlete must communicate with each teacher prior to missing a class to ensure they are on top of their school work .

Located on the Upper East Side , this organization provides inexpensive , nutritious lunches to senior citizens who want to socialize with others . All morning , we were in the kitchen , making and packaging various foods . We made meatloaf , packaged cold packs for the senior citizens who were there that day , and helped prepare the plates of food . One of the highlights of the trip was making ice cream sundaes , which were the dessert for that day . Once everything was prepared , we mingled with some of the senior citizens , and then served them their lunch . Everyone had a great experience helping the community and spending time with their peers . We thank Mr. O'Keefe for supervising us on the trip . <p> Our advisory took a trip to the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen to volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8 miles ) and arrived around 9 am . We started by listening in on the announcements andthe people running the soup kitchen briefed us on the basic rules . As we assumed the positions we weregiven , people started rushing in with their trays . We soon became experts at what we were doing ( giving outbread , scooping rice , cleaning tables , giving out beverages or handing out toiletries ) . We came to understandand sympathize with those who needed help and by the end of the experience , we did . Our advisory groupthoroughly enjoyed the community service opportunity and we hope to go again ! <p> So - it was freezing cold that day , working in nature for the NYC Parks Conservation Corps . It felt great to goout to some more distant parts of the city ( Jamaica ) , and see the more rural aspects .

It was great ! <p> On April 23 , 2014 Mr. Afshinnekoo 's homeroom group of students walked to the Metropolitan Pavilion to helpdesigners out for the event ' Design on a Dime ' . The event had designers design rooms and sell products . Themoney earned would be donated to a cause to help fight against HIV and poverty . Our group helped clean upthe area for the designers to work in and sometimes help the designers directly with organization or other thingsthey may need help in . For a good first half of the project , most of the group worked on breaking down thelarge pile of cardboard boxes , plastic , and styrofoam and throwing them out to the dumpster outside . Many ofus did various things . One designer needed help with bringing out poles to the main big room . Another neededhelp with fixing the labels on candles and organizing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows as well . Overall we enjoyed the new experience and were glad to have this experience , help out designers , and see the different rooms they had set up for the evening . <p> On Wednesday the April 17 , 2014 we went on a community service trip to Astoria , Queens . We decided to help the fellow citizens of NYC in an initiative of City Harvest ; we were handing out food that we packed personally and fortunately enough our directors were very interactive therefore we got to know them quite well . Each group had a different job . For example , one group was packing carrots in 5 , 8 , and 10 pound plastic bags . Each group had a supervisor . They showed us how we could help , supported us and helped us with any issues we had . During this trip , we got the chance to socialize with new people . This trip was a new experience for us . While we had lots of fun helping out the community , we also feel that it was a learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about your next meal through the people we helped . We met many elderly , adults , young children , and even some people my age . This opened our eyes to the fact that people who are the same age as us are living such drastically different lives . Although we often overlook it , being in that environment made us realize how privileged and fortunate we are . Overall , we are very happy that we were able to help many people that day , and take part in such a great cause ! <p> On April 28 , 2014 local community . We were instructed to pull out unnecessary weeds out of the ground as well as fill in areas withoutdirt , with mulch . We also planted new plants , butterfly weeds , and threw away rosebush branches into the dumpster . Wehelped others by helping the garden grow and prosper . The garden is also an important habitat for some birds and helpsthe environment.We learned a lot about gardening and landscaping in general . Prior to this , we were inexperienced in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differentiate plants from weeds , as they both look very similar . Werealized that active volunteering at gardens like this is very important , because the process takes a long time and requires asizable magnitude of a working force.We found the high level of focus required in order to separate the weeds from plants and the physical strain . Toovercome this challenge , we were able to slow ourselves down and patiently work our way around all these areas with thehelp of our partners who were also working with us . The weather was also very hot and sunny , making the work long andtiresome . Our solution was to take short rests and talk while working to make the process easier and more fun.This was a helpful experience to our personal development as it allowed us to understand the importance ofgardening and landscaping to the New York City and the benefit for its community . It was also fun to be outside workingwith each other and simultaneously learning new skills . Although this landscaping opportunity was one of our firstexperiences in this area , we certainly hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we had to use ourcommunication skills in order to complete certain tasks , which required teamwork . Identifying the parts where mulchingwas needed was definitely one place where communication played a huge role . It also helped in scenarios where we had todifferentiate weeds from plants . Overall this experience was extremely useful for us and taught us a lot about life outsideof school and sports , which occupy most of our lives . we also learned that by volunteering a few hours , residents andother volunteers can improve parks and recreational areas of New York City to make the promenade more colorful . <p> On April 30th 2014 Mr.Richards ' homeroom went to a Soup Kitchen and helped out for around 5 hours . To prepare for the arrival of our guests , we cleaned and sanitized the tables , chairs and the kitchen , restocked on juice and other food and drink .

First the people in the kitchen would put chicken , pasta , vegetables and a slice of bread on the plates . Next two people will stock all the plates onto a carte and roll it out into the dining room , they will put them onto the tables and go back into the kitchen .

Kilimanjaro in Tanzania : <p> Ten years ago I took a keen interest in global warming and its impact on the earth . I came upon an article about Mt . Kilimanjaro losing its snow due to this phenomenon . The information moved me so much that I began to deeply reflect on my carbon footprint . I decided that I had no choice but to go and see what is left before it 's all gone . For many reasons , things did not fall in place so I was not able to visit Mt .

I enjoyed walking , talking about the different plants and animals with the guides and stopping to take pictures in the rain forest , the moorland and the alpine desert . Walking through the alpine desert became a challenge for me once we left the section with plants . The air got heavy and so did my legs at the end of the six-hour walk to base camp . At this point , I was a bit worried because six hours later my legs needed to be fresh for the climb up the mountain . After dinner my guide told me that he would adjust the plan : instead of leaving at midnight , we would leave two hours later so my body could have time to recover . I was glad to find out that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits . During the climb I faced many challenges . My heart would beat so fast that I thought it was going to break through my skin however once I slowed my pace things improved .

My legs remained heavy but I just took my time to the top . <p> At the top , I was so tired mentally and physically but the sight of that sign saying I have reached the highest point in Africa invigorated me . Also I was sad when I noticed how the snow is receding to barely anything . It took a lot of strength to handle all the diversity I faced that day . <p> The mental strength that carried me to the top of Kilimanjaro ( 5895 m ) changed me forever .

Whether your family is new or returning , whether you will attend the Queens or Manhattan campus , you will find here an exceptionally dynamic and inclusive community , one that is committed to academic rigor and student success , stewarded by an outstanding and dedicated faculty and staff . I feel privileged to lead this community and look forward to getting to know the families of the 1580 students from 125 countries who are joining us this year . <p> As a school we will continue to develop our strategic plan and to involve the entire community as it evolves .

Their recommendations , together with our own strategic goals for the future , will provide us with an invaluable road map for years to come . <p> The UNIS Leadership Team , faculty and staff have spent the last two weeks together in truly collaborative and interactive workshops , meetings and discussions focused on best practices in teaching and learning in the differentiated classroom , all in service of student success .

I do not exaggerate when I state that it never ceases to be both inspiring and moving to witness .
