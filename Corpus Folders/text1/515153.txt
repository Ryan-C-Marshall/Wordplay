@@88705844 @4205844/ <h> Our Story &amp; Our Service <p> - I founded Ivy Lettings in 2009 following a career as a finance lawyer here in London . My first child had just been born and my young family wanted to spend some time abroad , hoping to finance the trip with income from our apartment in West London . Since we 'd be abroad , we wanted someone to handle the whole process for us , but we were unable to find anyone we felt happy entrusting our home to . Eventually we found a tenant through a traditional high street agent , but the let did n't go brilliantly , essentially because high street agents do n't really focus on short let 's and we did n't feel the let was managed as well as it might have been . I imagine the tenant who stayed in our flat felt the same . <p> So when we were abroad , I thought about setting up the kind of company that I would want to deal with , both as a homeowner and as a renter . Back in London a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lettings with the clear view that it would be a professional , friendly , highly competent , practical service to clients on both sides. - <p> For the first 6 months it was just me ( supported by my brilliant wife ! ) working out of our spare room . I bought a Vespa on eBay , and with bundles of linen bungy-tied to the back , I 'd dart around London making up the beds before checking in guests . There were a couple of low points : a few days before Christmas 2009 , a particularly heavy bundle of linen flew off the Vespa as I skidded round Hyde Park corner in the snow , and when I collided with a van and flew over the handle bars . I was black and blue for a few days and very stiff , but the van 's insurers paid me -1000 in compensation which was welcome investment in the business ! To start with , we had about 12 properties , but word of my service spread and with some great press coverage , our portfolio grew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented some office space . <p> Six years later and we are now a team of 12 full time staff and housekeepers . We moved to World 's End Studios on the Lots Road in Chelsea four years ago and we rent a large linen storage facility across the road , from which our linen van conducts its bi-weekly deliveries . We have a portfolio of around 120 properties and I 'm proud that many of their owners have been with us since our first year of trading . They are loyal clients for whom I 'd do pretty much anything , because they helped grow my business steadily through strong word of mouth . To date we have managed almost 10,000 bookings . I 'm thrilled with this figure but what makes me really happy is when I read our guests ' feedback and so many tell me that this is their 7th or 8th time they 've booked with us . <p> At 120 properties , we have n't yet finished our journey . We want to grow still , but our mission is n't to be London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short stays . It is to be its best , and I 'm proud to claim that we 're moving steadily towards that goal . We 're in no particular rush - we do n't have any demanding shareholders breathing down our neck with aggressive revenue targets , and in any event , the quality and personal nature of the service we provide does not scale quickly or easily. - <p> Every year we improve every aspect of the business , from our website to our booking enquiry responses , from the occupancy rates of our homes to the quality of our bed linen , from our housekeeping reporting systems to guest check in logistics . These are all key metrics of success and which improve our clients ' stays each time , but to some extent they take place in the background .

Here you 'll find wide , safe streets and arguably the world 's most famous market , Portobello. - <h> Ivy 's Guide to Notting Hill and Holland Park <p> A Brief History- Notting Hill has always been a desirable place to live . In the early 19th Century , London 's population was increasing rapidly , and yet , like today , there was a housing shortage. - James Weller Ladbroke , owner of much of what is today Notting Hill , - had a strong business sense , and decided- to try his hand at property development . He set to work- transforming the existing- farmland into a residential area . It was designed to be a beautiful series of crescents with gardens on either side - as in the garden in the film ' Notting Hill ' . - There are sixteen of these communal gardens , and many are hidden between the houses so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses still remain today : you 'll find terraced and semi-detached villas with handmade- stucco or half stucco exteriors . Luckily , only a few houses were destroyed during the World War bombings , known as ' The Blitz ' . These beautiful half-moon shaped streets can be found throughout the area , including Royal Crescent , which is historically protected under a- Grade II* listing . <p> Portobello has always attracted travellers from around the world . Following WW2 , Irish railway workers and Jews came to live in the area . Portobello 's famous Paella stand also has its own heritage ; during the Spanish Civil War , many Spaniards escaped to London and settled here , and after the war , more Spanish exiles arrived , fleeing the dictatorship of General Franco . <p> Many of Portobello market 's stalls have been family owned for centuries . You 'll find that some vendors are running the same stands that their great grandparents and great great grandparents originally founded . Portobello market 's antique dealers have a particularly interesting heritage ; after the Blitz bombings of WW2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , and they left behind a mass of furniture . Business-minded Londoners then took the furniture to Portobello Market to be sold as antiques - - and it 's been a hugely successful trade ever since. - Portobello MarketWhere a winding country path known as Green 's Lane ' once transported farm produce to nearby hamlets , today stands one of the world 's most famous street markets . It 's bursting- at the seams with antiques , vintage fashion stores and bakeries. - Whether you 're looking for vintage clothes or street food , you 'll experience Portobello as the heart and soul of Notting Hill. - <p> CafesOur favourite Holland Park cafe is the Italian run- Melograno , serving all sorts of delicious homemade Italian treats . The pesto lasagna , which can also be bought to take away , is excellent. - <p> Hummingbird Bakery- dishes out daily perfection in the form of world renowned- cupcakes . Located on the Portobello Road , Hummingbird is ideal for a little pick-me-up after browsing vintage wares in the surrounding arcades , some of which date back to Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make- ricotta hotcakes to die for . Lowry &amp; Baker- have got the relaxed- brunch feel spot-on with their open planned kitchen and casually dressed- chefs that look and sound like your best friend ( albeit one that cooks exceptionally well ) . Sit in the window and people-watch the- Portobello Road. - LunchBooks for- Cooks- is run by the chefs who give cookery classes upstairs . Downstairs , there is a magical cookery bookshop , with piles of books stacked in every inch of space . At the far end of the shop is a little cafe , where chefs run a test kitchen that serves up dishes from their own- recipe- books . Food here is a steal - 3 courses costs just -8 . Arrive by- 11.30am to guarantee a table for lunch , or go in the afternoon for tea and homemade cake. - Bumpkin- is a favourite of Notting Hill locals .

Open on Saturdays only , their paella is made from scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the- crowds that gather to watch the- chefs in action . - <p> DinnerOsteria- Basilico- must be the most romantic dinner spot in Notting HIl . An institution of Italian food among locals , - it always receives more demand than it has tables for . The owners- have since opened a sister restaurant next door , also very good. - Further down Blenheim Crescent , towards Holland Park , is the- luxurious- Casa Cruz. - Here you 'll find- glitz and glamour , from the- prime Argentinian steak served on silver platters , to the bronzed panelled walls and green velvet chairs that give the dining room a 1920s feel.ShopIn the little V shaped street where Westbourne Grove meets- Colville Road , lies a hub of world-class boutiques . From- Paul Smith- to- Helmut Lang , this is an ideal spot for shoppers that want to avoid the busy streets of Oxford Circus. - <p> Bars &amp; PubsNotting Hill is a hub of traditional English pubs , many of which now serve very good food . The best are- The- Windsor Castle , with its maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladbroke Arms , which serves seasonal food and is decorated with a mass of hanging baskets . The pretty- Anglesea Arms- also attracts a glamorous crowd after 5pm. - - <p> Kensington Wine Rooms- is a chic sit-down wine bar with a very good tapas menu . Glass-panelled Enomatic wine dispensers allow customers to taste as much or as little of any wine as they like. - <p> Explore ( with kids ) - Holland Park- is a- 54 acre wooded wildlife park built around the ruins of Holland House , bombed in the 1940s during the Blitz . Today , the park offers- the summertime Holland Park Opera as well as pop-up theatre , temporary exhibitions and a year-round- series of adventures for children and adults . The- children 's playground- has ziplines , tyre swings , spider climbing and even a rocket climbing frame. - If you 're 3ft tall , the high-rise climbing frames- are endless fun. - <p> For a moment of zen , head to the- Kyoto Gardens , hidden in the- park 's centre . The garden was a gift from the Japanese government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange Koi Carp under the waterfalls- to the occasional peacock that wanders through the gardens at will. - <p> The most photographed streets in London- are the brightly painted houses- of Notting Hill . The multicoloured terraced houses in Elgin Crescent are our favourite. - - <p> Visit the- Museum of Brands- for a fun , whacky exploration of consumer culture over the past century .

@@88705895 @4205895/ <h> Flat out in central London <p> The English upper classes have a proud tradition of renting out the family pile to earn a bit of cash . <p> So when the global financial crisis left finance lawyer Guy Van der Westhuizen scraping around for cash , it seemed only natural to let his swanky London apartment on a short-term basis -- or monetise it , as finance people say . <p> He asked an agent to rent it out for a couple of weeks and also put an ad online . A New Zealand family wanted it for a week and the agent found someone to rent it for five weeks . Being an entrepreneurial sort , Van der Westhuizen took on the five-week tenant and found a flat for the Kiwi family as well . Thus was Ivy Lettings born . <p> " There was no company specialising in short-term rentals of private apartments . I realised there were lots of people who had flats in London they only used for one or two weeks a month and who would be happy to rent them out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> " At the same time , there were people who preferred the larger living space of an apartment , and the fact that they could cook for themselves , especially if they were going to stay longer than a night or two . " Most of the renters are Australians , New Zealanders and South Africans , plus a few Canadians and Americans . <p> Ivy Lettings now has more than 70 properties on its books , all within 20 minutes of the centre of London on public transport . They range from Hampstead in the north to Notting Hill and Holland Park in the west , sprinkled through the fashionable suburbs of Kensington , Chelsea , Knightsbridge , Mayfair and Belgravia , Covent Garden , Bloomsbury , the City of London and Tower Bridge . <p> You choose the property by visiting the website and searching according to the number of beds you need , your preferred location and budget . Properties start from pound stg. 500 ( $752 ) a week , with the most expensive from a cool pound stg. 5000 a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes of the rich and famous . For example , a six-bedroom Chelsea townhouse at Petyt Place was once the home of Don Factor , the son of cosmetics king Max . It is now owned by a renowned American author and his artist wife , although the website , semi-discreetly , does n't tell us who they are . <p> Judging by the furnishings , the author writes bodice-ripping romances . The house is on the banks of the Thames and has river views and gardens . Decked out with Georgian furniture and paintings , with blue-and-white porcelain on the mantelpieces and fine carpets , this place is all frills , flounces and chandeliers . <p> The great virtue of Ivy Lettings is that every property is unique , if not idiosyncratic . Our stay is in a basement apartment at Covent Garden . The location is fantastic ; we are in the heart of the theatre district behind the Royal Ballet School . We could walk to theatres , the National Gallery , Leicester Square , Piccadilly Circus , Oxford Street and Mayfair .

There is loads of light and space , including a small outdoor terrace , which would have been more use had the maximum temperature not been a bracing 11C ( yes , in midsummer ) . <p> This unexpected cold snap leads to a second problem . We ca n't work out how to turn up the heating . There is an explanation in the information folder but we ca n't find the heating control and as it is quite late , we feel bad about ringing for assistance . <p> We bring back food to heat up only to discover there is no microwave . We are also keen to wash accumulated laundry but the flat has one of those machines that claims to wash as well as dry your clothes , and does neither satisfactorily . <p> At our first attempt , the clothes are still wet so we have another go . But despite leaving on the drying cycle for a couple of hours , the clothes are still a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the washing machine again , so we we 're back to square one . <p> Our last attempt more or less cooks our clothes , which come out smaller , harder and not quite the same colour . <p> Some people find hotels impersonal and would much rather have a home away from home . For others , looking at a stranger 's family photos and seeing signs asking you to lay off the wine or food is a bit like staying in an up-market group house . But , thanks to Ivy Lettings , the choice is yours . <p> Rebecca Weisser was a guest of Ivy Lettings . <p> ChecklistPrice for the one-bedroom basement apartment is from -stg1050 a week .

The South African- asked him how he 's using his background to build his UK business <p> I spent the first few years of my life in Johannesburg before my family moved to England . Since then I have lived between Oxford and here in London , where I moved permanently in 2001 to attend law school . I maintain strong connections with South Africa though , with family in Cape Town and Durban who I visit frequently . <p> Tell me about your business . What is your role ? We are residential short-lets specialists , arranging accommodation for travellers visiting London - or often Londoners moving house - for any period of time between three nights and six months and sometimes - longer . - We - have - a portfolio - of - 75+ centrally-located properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prices range from <p> -500 to 5 000 per week . Essentially , we offer a more economical , personal and - interesting - alternative to hotels and serv : ) ced apartments . I founded the business and run it on a day-to-day basis . <p> What inspired you to start up Ivy Lettings ? <p> The experiences of my South African family and friends visiting London , which taught me that visitors to London are largely unimpressed by the city 's hotels : either they are hugely expensive or very drab and poor quality - and very often both ! Having to eat out for at least two meals a day , which is not cheap in London , also adds to the expense . It struck me that travellers would prefer to stay in a self-catered home which is indicative of London instead . There are plenty of properties like this , mostly second homes , which have allowed us to pick and choose a fantastic selection . <p> How has your background as a lawyer helped with the functioning of your busineSs ? <p> Hugely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company , to drafting lease agreements and everything in between that requires attention to detail . Perhaps most importantly , I think clients on both sides greatly appreciate the professionalism - which - sticks - out - a - mile - in - the- scam-plagued London vacation rental industry and general real estate market , which has never been too close to Londoners ' hearts ... . <p> Why do you think the option ofletting out homes appeals to home owners ? <p> Firstly , money . So many people have second homes in London that they use infrequently but enough to prevent them from letting them out long term , which means for large amounts of the year their properties are wasted assets . Secondly , peace of mind- and security ; homes need to be lived in and whenever you are away for a few weeks or months it gives comfort to know that your home is being looked after rather than lying empty . <p> What has the response to your business been like- so far ? <p> Phenomenal - our portfolio grew from three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Travellers using our service have raved about it , which is really pleasing , and we 've had a lot ofinterest from companies too whose budgetry constraints- mean expensive hotel- stays for visiting staff are a thing of the past but who are still looking for high quality , conveniently-located accommodation . We 've had some very flattering coverage in the Antipodean press also , which keeps us busy with a steady flow of enquiries ! <p> Has being a South African in the UK helped you to tap into the Antipodean market ? <p> Definitely- there is certainly a shared openness of mind amongst Antipodeans which makes dealing with one another easier . People are always slightly confused to hear an English accent coming from somebody with such a South African - surname but being able to establish a bond through shared nationality really helps develop relationships , which is key to us . This is especially valuable in a city like- London , which is so huge and often so anonymous. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What 's the most important lesson you have learnt about business ? <p> I am very much still learning but so far ... reputation , - reputation , reputation -treat your customers like kings and they will do your marketing for you .

To be honest , I am not sure either are particularly fertile grounds just at the moment , but believe that London 's challenges are more of a transitory economic nature , rather than an endemic political one .

@@88705904 @4205904/ <h> Flat out in central London <p> The English upper classes have a proud tradition of renting out the family pile to earn a bit of cash . <p> So when the global financial crisis left finance lawyer Guy Van der Westhuizen scraping around for cash , it seemed only natural to let his swanky London apartment on a short-term basis -- or monetise it , as finance people say . <p> He asked an agent to rent it out for a couple of weeks and also put an ad online . A New Zealand family wanted it for a week and the agent found someone to rent it for five weeks . Being an entrepreneurial sort , Van der Westhuizen took on the five-week tenant and found a flat for the Kiwi family as well . Thus was Ivy Lettings born . <p> " There was no company specialising in short-term rentals of private apartments . I realised there were lots of people who had flats in London they only used for one or two weeks a month and who would be happy to rent them out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> " At the same time , there were people who preferred the larger living space of an apartment , and the fact that they could cook for themselves , especially if they were going to stay longer than a night or two . " Most of the renters are Australians , New Zealanders and South Africans , plus a few Canadians and Americans . <p> Ivy Lettings now has more than 70 properties on its books , all within 20 minutes of the centre of London on public transport . They range from Hampstead in the north to Notting Hill and Holland Park in the west , sprinkled through the fashionable suburbs of Kensington , Chelsea , Knightsbridge , Mayfair and Belgravia , Covent Garden , Bloomsbury , the City of London and Tower Bridge . <p> You choose the property by visiting the website and searching according to the number of beds you need , your preferred location and budget . Properties start from pound stg. 500 ( $752 ) a week , with the most expensive from a cool pound stg. 5000 a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes of the rich and famous . For example , a six-bedroom Chelsea townhouse at Petyt Place was once the home of Don Factor , the son of cosmetics king Max . It is now owned by a renowned American author and his artist wife , although the website , semi-discreetly , does n't tell us who they are . <p> Judging by the furnishings , the author writes bodice-ripping romances . The house is on the banks of the Thames and has river views and gardens . Decked out with Georgian furniture and paintings , with blue-and-white porcelain on the mantelpieces and fine carpets , this place is all frills , flounces and chandeliers . <p> The great virtue of Ivy Lettings is that every property is unique , if not idiosyncratic . Our stay is in a basement apartment at Covent Garden . The location is fantastic ; we are in the heart of the theatre district behind the Royal Ballet School . We could walk to theatres , the National Gallery , Leicester Square , Piccadilly Circus , Oxford Street and Mayfair . The Monopoly board is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the city that stays up late , the basement apartment is very quiet . There is loads of light and space , including a small outdoor terrace , which would have been more use had the maximum temperature not been a bracing 11C ( yes , in midsummer ) . <p> This unexpected cold snap leads to a second problem . We ca n't work out how to turn up the heating . There is an explanation in the information folder but we ca n't find the heating control and as it is quite late , we feel bad about ringing for assistance . <p> We bring back food to heat up only to discover there is no microwave . We are also keen to wash accumulated laundry but the flat has one of those machines that claims to wash as well as dry your clothes , and does neither satisfactorily . <p> At our first attempt , the clothes are still wet so we have another go . But despite leaving on the drying cycle for a couple of hours , the clothes are still a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the washing machine again , so we we 're back to square one . <p> Our last attempt more or less cooks our clothes , which come out smaller , harder and not quite the same colour . <p> Some people find hotels impersonal and would much rather have a home away from home . For others , looking at a stranger 's family photos and seeing signs asking you to lay off the wine or food is a bit like staying in an up-market group house . But , thanks to Ivy Lettings , the choice is yours . <p> Rebecca Weisser was a guest of Ivy Lettings . <p> ChecklistPrice for the one-bedroom basement apartment is from -stg1050 a week . Cleaning , documentation fees and VAT are extra . During the London Olympics next year , the rent for this flat will range from -2750 to -3950 a week . <p> Most properties include internet access ; otherwise Ivy Lettings can arrange it . Renters must pay for the phone if it 's a large bill but there 's no charge for a few local calls . Five-night minimum stay . More : - ivylettings.com.

@@88705912 @4205912/ <h> Best Restaurants , Bars and Tearooms in South Kensington <h> Best Restaurants , Bars and Tearooms in South Kensington <p> Londoners are very grateful for the influx of French and Italians to South Kensington ( known as petit Paris ' or little Paris ' among my French friends ) . Why ? Well it 's not because South Kensington is full of well-dressed , tanned and good looking people , though this is widely appreciated . It 's because the restaurants that have recently opened are a cut above the Italian exports of the 90s ( think Carluccio 's ) . This is why 7/10 of my top 10 bars and restaurants in South Kensington are French and Italian - though of course a large part of the Sampler and The Enterprise 's wine stock is also from the Continent <p> 1 . A glass ( or 4 ) of wine at The Sampler <p> - <p> I talked a bit about the joys of the Enomatic wine dispenser in my last post . The Sampler were one of the first and most successful wine bars to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sampler offers Londoners the opportunity to explore a variety of world wines on a spectrum of price points , and unlike many wine bars in London , there are plenty of bottles under -15 that you can take home . They serve nibbles too : I 've been known to leave with plates of duck rilettes , cheese and wine to go for a post-tasting picnic in Hyde Park. - <p> Tip : Rather than hover around by the bottles , nab a table downstairs where you can enjoy a peaceful discussion about how much/little you know about what you 're drinking . <p> A friend and I once found ourselves starving hungry , at 8pm , at the door of Macellaio RC and without a reservation . We really had to beg to get a table here . Thankfully , the waiters were male and Italian , and we were , well , two ladies . Macellaio is where London 's Italians come to pay homage to Italian meat . It was some of the best steak , liver and rabbit-stuffed ravioli I 've ever had. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared at the counter - the quality of their produce is fantastic and is beautifully laid out . <p> When I turned 24 , a friend took me here for tea .

The 5* Egerton House Hotel offers a much more intimate , English country home ' experience than any other London tearoom. - <p> Tip : The best sofa is worth fighting for - the big velvet sofa facing the fire .

A sealed pack rarely costs more than -6 . If you 're staying at Drayton Gardens , Luigi 's is a 1 minute walk away . <p> Tip : Be especially nice to the serving staff .

It has soul , and is much loved by its regulars . It 's often hard to get from the beginning of Walton Street to the Enterprise without taking an hour , because you have to pass all the tempting boutiques of Walton Street on your way . Still , it 's worth the struggle. - <p> Tip : At the moment they 're offering a free glass of house wine between 6 and 7pm . They also do lunch offers on Tuesdays - see the website for details. - <p> Bibendium also has a seafood restaurant on the first floor , but I think that the Oyster bar downstairs is wonderful , and better value . It 's set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both areas have a pretty mosaic floor . The seafood is still some of the best in London . Admire the stained glass windows featuring Bibendium , the Michelin man himself , and the decorative metal work that supports this Art Nouveau structure .

Their comments are that 1 ) it 's very good value 2 ) the food is exceptional 3 ) the New York loft/ minimalist Scandinavian decor is inspiring 4 ) the waiting staff are really lovely .

An Oyster card is a magnetic top-up travel card , for use on trains within the London area . Simply touch the card on the magnetic card reader when you go through the station barriers , and , voila ! you 're through to the trains . <p> What transport can I use it for ? - You can use it for buses , trains and tubes " as long as they 're within the London area . <p> How much is an Oyster card ? They 're free " though you will need to pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you when you hand back your card to a London Underground ticket office at the end of your stay . <p> Why is an Oyster card better than a travelcard ? The Oyster has a number of benefits : <p> -- - - - - - It may work out cheaper . Travelcards cover your travel within zones 1-4 , so even if you do n't want to travel to zone 3 or 4 , you 'll be paying for it. - - <p> -- - - - - - It 's less confusing . There are two types of Travelcard , and it 's difficult to make a decision about which zones you 're going to travel in when you 've just arrived in London and have a handful of suitcases and family members to juggle . <p> -- - - - - - If you or anyone you know is planning to come back to London , you/they can re-use the card . <p> Sounds great " where can I get one ?

I 've shared my own calculations with you ( below ) , based on the daily cap that the Oyster automatically makes on your daily travel spend in 2015/2016 . If you 're travelling within zones 1-3 , you can take as many journeys as you like on bus , train and tube for -7.50 each day . Here 's what I recommend for different lengths of stay : - <p> For 5 days in London : -37.50 <p> For 7 days in London : -52.50 <p> For 2 weeks in London : -105 <p> For 1 month in London : -232.50 <p> If you 're only travelling in zones 1-2 , this will be slightly less . <p> Do children get discounted travel ? Yes . If your child is under 11 years old , they can travel free with you , if you have an Oyster card . <p> If your child is aged 11-15 , then they can get a half-price Oyster card . <p> Over 15s will need an adult price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your cardThere 's nothing worse than not having enough money on your Oyster to pay for the bus , and then having to find an Underground station to top up , before heading back to the bus stop ( trust me " it 's a nightmare ) . So I strongly recommend you put more credit than you need , rather than less , on your Oyster as soon as you purchase one from an Underground station ticket office . You 'll be reimbursed for what you have n't spent when you hand back your Oyster to an Underground ticket office at the end of your stay . <p> - Above : My favourtite entrance to a London Underground statio , at Westminster . <p> Do n't take your Oyster to the airportI 've made this mistake a few times .

A few of our guests have left London with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -50 left on each card . Oyster cards do n't expire " so if you 're coming back soon then this might even be convenient . But if you 're not planning a return trip soon , do n't forget to take your Oyster to an Underground ticket office ( as opposed to an Overground train ticket office ) before you leave London . Ticket offices at big stations close after 9pm , and smaller stations normally close around 5pm on weekends , and later during the week . If you forget to return your Oyster then you 'll have to send it by post to Transport for London , and this can take several weeks for your reimbursement to be processed . <p> Can I travel using my contactless debit/credit card ? Yes " if it was issued in the UK . If your card was issued internationally , then it could incur fees when used for contactless travel . We recommend that you go for the safe option and purchase an Oyster . Remember , you will get reimbursed when you hand back your card .

Politics seemed the obvious next step for the playwright , and indeed he brought his unwavering humour and common sense to the House of Commons : when Edmund Burke , giving a speech warning of the threat of French Revolutionary spies and agents ready and waiting in London to initiate the feared invasion of Britain , threw a knife into the floor to emphasise his point , Sheridan is said to have called out Where 's the fork ?

Wodehouse has given us many gems with which to while away the long winter evenings ' , to quote Bertie Wooster , and I for one will be forever grateful for the immortal line uttered by one of his terrible anti-heroines , Madeleine Basset : Have n't you ever thought that the stars are God 's daisy chain ?

Increasing numbers of websites are springing up which allow people to rent out their properties for short periods . But homeowners who take advantage of them need to be careful they are not breaking any rules . <p> Websites such as Oxfordshire-based- Holiday Lettings , which became part of the Trip Advisor group in 2010 , are designed for those who are new to lettings or only want to let their home for a few weeks a year . It launched a free listing service in February and is running an advertising campaign asking homeowners to " see how much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lettings takes 3% of any bookings you receive , plus VAT . That means if you were to let a property for -700 a week , its cut , including VAT , would be -25.20 , while if you let your home out for -1,500 a week , Holiday Lettings would take -54 including VAT . Guests pay the company a 5% booking fee which is automatically added to the rental price . <p> Your home does not have to meet any particular standards if you are renting it out , but obviously if the photographs you take to advertise it show it looking cluttered and dirty , you are unlikely to get many takers . <p> " Good transport links are important too , and you should also give some thought to local events happening while you are away and which could attract people , " says a spokesman for Holiday Lettings . <p> " When deciding how much to let your property for , look at comparable properties on the site to give you an idea of price . Be careful not to overestimate or underestimate how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people off . " <p> There are other similar websites specialising in putting you in touch with potential house guests , such as- Wimdu.co.uk . Again , this site allows you to list your home " or a spare room " for free , and takes 3% from each booking . Homeowners are insured against any accidental damage caused by people staying in their property . <p> Ivy Lettings- also specialises in renting out people 's homes , though only if they are based in London . Properties need to be in zone 1 or inner zone 2 , available for at least 12 weeks in total a year or at least eight weeks between June and September , and fully furnished to a high standard . Ivy Lettings says commission varies depending on the property , how large it is and how many people it can accommodate , but is typically around 20% plus VAT . <p> However , before you can let your home , you need to be aware of some golden rules to avoid potential pitfalls : <h> Mortgage <p> The Halifax says borrowers need permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breach of their mortgage terms and conditions . <p> " One of the conditions of us providing our consent is that all lettings are carried out through an assured shorthold tenancy agreement , " says a spokesman . " However , the minimum period that one of these can be set for is six months . " <p> This policy applies to all of Lloyds Banking Group 's mortgage brands , which also include Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland . Yorkshire building society also says it will not give consent for its mortgage customers to let out their homes for a fortnight . <p> However , some lenders are more flexible . A spokesman for Santander says : " If someone is letting out their home while they are away on two weeks ' holiday , we would want the borrower to ask us for consent , but this would not be unreasonably withheld .

There would need to be evidence of forcible or violent entry to make a claim . <p> " We would also encourage homeowners to secure their valuables and property , ideally taking high-value items such as jewellery with them or locking them up in a secure safe . " <p> Direct Line also says it will cover properties if let while the owner is on holiday , though there would be an additional premium . A spokesman says : " We would usually limit this to two individuals , or one family , staying for no more than six weeks . Accidental damage cover will not apply while the property is let , and theft cover will be restricted to forcible and violent entry . The additional premium will vary from customer to customer . " <h> Local council <p> Some do n't allow short-term let 's unless you have permission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption . For example , according to Westminster council you need permission if you want to let your property for less than 90 days . Without it , you are breaking the law and could be fined up to -20,000 . <h> Tax <p> If you can overcome all these hurdles , remember that tax will be payable on any income you receive . However , if you are only letting out a room or a floor rather than your whole property , you should be eligible for tax relief on any money that you earn . <p> Under the government 's Rent a Room scheme , you can earn up to -4,250 a year tax free from renting out your spare room . This applies whether you rent or own your home , although if renting you will need to confirm that your lease allows a lodger . <p> The Lewis family are camping in their garden this summer " and letting their house . <p> Photograph : Stephen Shepherd for The Observer /Stephen Shepherd for The Observer <p> - <h> Or you could camp in your garden <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be camping during next month 's Glastonbury Festival - but they will be in their own garden next to the site while their home earns enough money to pay for their annual holiday . <p> The couple and their three children , Ellie , Morwenna and Harvey , live just a muddy wellington boot 's throw from Worthy Farm , where the Rolling Stones , Mumford &amp; Sons and Arctic Monkeys will headline this year's- event .

Increasing numbers of websites are springing up which allow people to rent out their properties for short periods . But homeowners who take advantage of them need to be careful they are not breaking any rules . <p> Websites such as Oxfordshire-based- Holiday Lettings , which became part of the Trip Advisor group in 2010 , are designed for those who are new to lettings or only want to let their home for a few weeks a year . It launched a free listing service in February and is running an advertising campaign asking homeowners to " see how much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lettings takes 3% of any bookings you receive , plus VAT . That means if you were to let a property for -700 a week , its cut , including VAT , would be -25.20 , while if you let your home out for -1,500 a week , Holiday Lettings would take -54 including VAT . Guests pay the company a 5% booking fee which is automatically added to the rental price . <p> Your home does not have to meet any particular standards if you are renting it out , but obviously if the photographs you take to advertise it show it looking cluttered and dirty , you are unlikely to get many takers . <p> " Good transport links are important too , and you should also give some thought to local events happening while you are away and which could attract people , " says a spokesman for Holiday Lettings . <p> " When deciding how much to let your property for , look at comparable properties on the site to give you an idea of price . Be careful not to overestimate or underestimate how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people off . " <p> There are other similar websites specialising in putting you in touch with potential house guests , such as- Wimdu.co.uk . Again , this site allows you to list your home " or a spare room " for free , and takes 3% from each booking . Homeowners are insured against any accidental damage caused by people staying in their property . <p> Ivy Lettings- also specialises in renting out people 's homes , though only if they are based in London . Properties need to be in zone 1 or inner zone 2 , available for at least 12 weeks in total a year or at least eight weeks between June and September , and fully furnished to a high standard . Ivy Lettings says commission varies depending on the property , how large it is and how many people it can accommodate , but is typically around 20% plus VAT . <p> However , before you can let your home , you need to be aware of some golden rules to avoid potential pitfalls : <h> Mortgage <p> The Halifax says borrowers need permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breach of their mortgage terms and conditions . <p> " One of the conditions of us providing our consent is that all lettings are carried out through an assured shorthold tenancy agreement , " says a spokesman . " However , the minimum period that one of these can be set for is six months . " <p> This policy applies to all of Lloyds Banking Group 's mortgage brands , which also include Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland . Yorkshire building society also says it will not give consent for its mortgage customers to let out their homes for a fortnight . <p> However , some lenders are more flexible . A spokesman for Santander says : " If someone is letting out their home while they are away on two weeks ' holiday , we would want the borrower to ask us for consent , but this would not be unreasonably withheld . " <h> Insurance <p> Most insurers will continue to provide cover as long as the letting has been organised through an agency , although they may put extra restrictions and limits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Asia Yasir , spokeswoman for esure home insurance , says : " There would be no additional premium if you were letting your home out for a fortnight , but there will be restricted theft cover . There would need to be evidence of forcible or violent entry to make a claim . <p> " We would also encourage homeowners to secure their valuables and property , ideally taking high-value items such as jewellery with them or locking them up in a secure safe . " <p> Direct Line also says it will cover properties if let while the owner is on holiday , though there would be an additional premium . A spokesman says : " We would usually limit this to two individuals , or one family , staying for no more than six weeks . Accidental damage cover will not apply while the property is let , and theft cover will be restricted to forcible and violent entry . The additional premium will vary from customer to customer . " <h> Local council <p> Some do n't allow short-term let 's unless you have permission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption . For example , according to Westminster council you need permission if you want to let your property for less than 90 days . Without it , you are breaking the law and could be fined up to -20,000 . <h> Tax <p> If you can overcome all these hurdles , remember that tax will be payable on any income you receive . However , if you are only letting out a room or a floor rather than your whole property , you should be eligible for tax relief on any money that you earn . <p> Under the government 's Rent a Room scheme , you can earn up to -4,250 a year tax free from renting out your spare room . This applies whether you rent or own your home , although if renting you will need to confirm that your lease allows a lodger . <p> The Lewis family are camping in their garden this summer " and letting their house . <p> Photograph : Stephen Shepherd for The Observer /Stephen Shepherd for The Observer <p> - <h> Or you could camp in your garden <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be camping during next month 's Glastonbury Festival - but they will be in their own garden next to the site while their home earns enough money to pay for their annual holiday . <p> The couple and their three children , Ellie , Morwenna and Harvey , live just a muddy wellington boot 's throw from Worthy Farm , where the Rolling Stones , Mumford &amp; Sons and Arctic Monkeys will headline this year's- event .

AirBnB hosts everywhere are falling over each other to compete for bookings and earn all star guest reviews . Here are a few basic , and in some cases pretty obvious , ways that go a long way to earn the appreciation of guests from around the world and turn your home into a wonderful London vacation rental home . <p> - <p> The Basics <p> - <p> Coffee machine . This is basically essential . Guests from overseas , especially those from North America , love coffee in the same way that Brits love tea . Remember also that depending on where they come from , they may be battling jet lag , so all the more reason to provide them with some form of coffee making equipment . It does n't need to be a -2000 barista-station , a Nespesso-capsule compatible machine will do find ( but do provide at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can purchase more ) . Alternatively , a French press / cafetiere is also acceptable . Most Americans will be used to a filter coffee machine , which you can purchase on Amazon for about -20 ( again , provide a supply of filters and some starter java ) <p> - <p> Microwave . This is pretty important and we at Ivy Lettings now require all our hosts to provide one ( even though many hate them ! ) Again they are an important feature in US kitchens ( more so clearly that in an English one ) and will significantly add to a guests enjoyment of your home . It does n't need to be a massive one , a small microwave which can be stored away if needed will suffice . <p> - <p> Hairdryers . These are another Ivy Lettings must have for our homes . Travellers do n't like bringing their own ( bulky , need adaptors ) and so providing one is an easy way to make their lives easier . If they complain that there is no three point socket to plug it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of domestic law , not poor bathroom design . <p> - <p> Beds <p> - <p> A good night 's sleep is critical to most people and that goes for your Airbnb guest too . We find at the enquiry stage guests cite a comfy bed as a key search criterion . Providing a bed with absolutely clean mattress , mattress protector , linen , duvet pillows is an absolute basic essential and nothing will turn a guest off quicker if this is n't the case in your home . Beyond that you should make sure your sheets and duvet covers are properly ironed and you use the nicest quality linen you can afford ( same goes for the towels - it counts ) . To cater for the allergic travellers - with no disrespect , Americans appear to suffer from allergies more that any other nationalities - provide foam pillows and hypoallergic duvets . Feather is so last century and to avoided , unless you 're selling it as a Downton Abbey experience . At Ivy Lettings we provide 5 star quality bed linen and towels as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to pleasing guests . <p> - <p> Bathrooms <p> - <p> Another sensitive area . Clear and store away all your toiletries . If you can provide a fresh supply of hotel-style minis ( shower gel , shampoo etc ) then great . But a clean and clear bathroom is an absolute must . If you 're serious about attracting guests , bear in mind that a shower for travellers from many countries of the world is essential , the more powerful the better . We recently listed a wonderful property in South Kensington which just was n't getting the booking levels we hoped for and when we looked into it , it was because it just had a bath . We persuaded the owner to install a shower and the home took off pretty much immediately .

It may be that you do n't have long here - you can be in London for several weeks and still leave without having taken it all in - so you want to be sure that the time you have here is well spent , exploring the city and enjoying yourself and your time with your friends or family . Here are a few tips on what to pack. - <p> Clothes <p> - <p> You do n't need to bring a ton of clothes . London 's climate is not so extreme , and obviously the kind of outerwear you bring will depend on the time of year , but know that London in the winter rarely drops below freezing , and the last two winters we 've had have been pretty mild . Certainly if you 're coming from the colder parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clement , and you wo n't need heavy goose down jackets and thermal underwear . In fact , we 'd actively counsel against these - if you 're exploring the city on foot , you 'll overheat very quickly , and you 'll realise you overdid it when you step into shops/pubs/almost any building which will be heated warmly . As you 'll hear so often when it comes to travel attire - layer up . Bring a wooly hat , a waterproof jacket with some thin insulation , and you 'll be fine . If it 's summer , well , pack for both summer and spring / fall , you can have some days in mid July which will need you to wear a jumper , but obviously hopefully you 'll be enjoying some sunshine too so bear that in mind . Summer temperatures rarely exceed 80F , and again , depending on where you come from , you 'll find London 's a pretty temperate climate . Do prepare for rain though at any time of year . Do n't lug a massive umbrella around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -5 , take around with you a disposable poncho ( if you are n't overly fashion conscious ! ) or , probably best , just wear a waterproof jacket . <p> - <p> Bear in mind - and this is one of the reasons many people select a London vacation home over a hotel - that all Ivy Lettings properties provide laundry facilities ( and detergent for them ) , so this should lighten your packing load ! <p> - <p> Comfortable Shoes <p> - <p> This depends on how much walking you 're planning on doing , but even if it is n't a lot , if you 're doing any decent amount of sightseeing , you 'll find you 're covering quite a bit of ground . So , bring trainers , good walking shoes . ( Whenever I 'm abroad , I always take my trusty Timberland hiking shoes , they 're lightweight , super comfortable and waterproof , and they look smart enough to wear to ( most ) restaurants ! ) <p> - <p> Camera- <p> - <p> This is up to you I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other latest generation smartphone , you may not need a separate camera . But just make sure you have something with you , be it your phone , your top of the range Canon DSLR or something in between . London is a fantastically photogenic city and you 'll want to record as much of it as you can . <p> - <p> Spare Phone Battery <p> - <p> If you 're anything like me , you 'll use your iPhone a lot to navigate the city , book tickets , make reservations , search exhibitions etc . And this drains your phone 's battery pretty quick . So invest in a portable spare battery , which you 've charged up prior to leaving your rental home . You can get pretty good ones which have several charges for your phone . <p> - <p> Helpful Apps to Download for your London Trip <p> - <p> Whilst we 're talking phones , I 'd recommend the following apps : CityMapper ( for getting about town , travel routes and live transport updates ) , Uber ( massive in London but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker walking or getting the tube , traffic in London can be horrific ) , Maps ( native iOS app or similar , e.g. Google Maps ) .

Unfortunately this is only really accessible to members of Hertford College or their adherents , as it joins two parts of the college together , spanning New College Lane . Nearby , the Radcliffe Camera ( again , sadly only accessible most of the time to members of the University ) sits serenely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Souls and Brasenose College , and is well worth a visit . Most of the colleges are open in the afternoons to any visitor , and we would particularly recommend looking at Magdalen College ( along with its deer park ) , New College , particularly its chapel , Trinity for its garden , Worcester for its front quadrangle , lake , and chapel which abounds with visual puns , and Keble , which has the largest dining hall of all the Oxford and Cambridge colleges put together . <p> . <p> Must SeeOxford is also well worth a visit for its libraries and museums , notably the Bodleian , one of the oldest libraries in Europe , and peculiar in its feature of having certain very old books kept in check by means of chains shackling them to their desks . All colleges boast beautiful libraries , some of which will be open to the public , so do always ask as it is well worth the trouble .

See here for more specific opening times , as they are seasonal . <p> A few miles outside the city proper , you 'll discover Blenheim Palace - home to the Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough , and birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill " a beautiful stately home built by two of the finest architects of the late 17th and early 18th centuries , John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor. - The palace itself is extremely grand , and can be visited for a fee ( see here for opening times and tickets ) , and the wonderful park and gardens will make for a splendid day out .

There is Evensong most evenings at many of the colleges , which is usually open to the public , and definitely an experience not to be missed. - We would particularly recommend New and Magdalen Colleges here . <p> . <p> Al FrescoFor those long balmy summer days , or crisp winter forenoons , take advantage of Oxford 's wonderful open green spaces - wander off for a walk on Port Meadow , and stop off at the Trout or Perch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Parks .

We would particularly recommend Al-Shami , a great little Lebanese restaurant on Walton Crescent , in what is locally nicknamed Jericho ' " North Oxford . Gee 's on Banbury Road , conspicuous with its greenhouse style building , is also a lovely place to go en famille or for a late diner + deux. - Fishers , by Magdalen College , on St Clements , is a wonderful fish and seafood restaurant " and located conveniently close to a variety of great pubs for a postprandial nightcap . <p> You 'll also be spoilt for choice in terms of pubs and bars , which is perhaps not surprising , given it is a university town .

What is there to see and do locally ? Below is one of our local area guides which can be found on every property page. - <p> - <p> - <p> 4 ) - - Check reviews <p> This is VIP . I would never stay somewhere that did n't have any reviews at all ( unless the vacation rental was listed only very recently ) .

This works both ways " if you enjoyed your stay somewhere , then do write a review ! <p> Make sure your London vacation rental is child-friendly . If you 're going through an agency , they should only offer you holiday homes that are suitable for your group configuration .

If every guest wants their own room , or a bed in a bedroom , make sure to read the listing thoroughly . Vacation rentals are not hotels - if on arrival you realize there are n't as many bedrooms as you were expecting , there wo n't be an option to pay for an extra room . <p> The same applies to additional beds " if you need a cot or an airbed , ask if these are on offer , and request one when you book to avoid disappointment . <p> You might also be surprised by some interesting bed arrangements when you travel in Europe .

Check if your vacation rental has the same benefit . <p> - <p> 8 ) - - Mobility- <p> If you have mobility requirements , it 's vital to check whether there are stairs to access the vacation home or stairs inside the property itself .

@@88706001 @4206001/ <p> Four years ago , time-rich but cash-poor , I wanted to rent out my Shepherd 's Bush home to finance a trip abroad . I searched the Internet for answers but found none . From this disappointing experience was born my London short let 's agency , Ivy Lettings . I persuaded all my friends to hand me their keys when they planned to go on holiday so I could let them out to tourists . Their very simple questions were all met with my confident " do n't worry " s and " I 'll take care of that " s . I knew that to earn my commission and add value I 'd have to do the grunt work and make good my promise to remove the hassle of preparing a home for a holiday let . Like most entrepreneurs - I like to think at least - I was winging it . Learning on the job . I 'd been a lawyer and a banker , not an estate agent or a cleaner . How hard could it be ? Four years and 2,500 let 's later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent and a letting owner ( I tasted my own medicine letting out my family 's home this summer through Ivy for 4 separate let 's ) here 's my experience and advice : <p> What 's it like to rent out your home ? <p> Letting out your home for holiday let 's ( AKA in US as " vacation rentals " ) is less and more stressful than you think . Let me explain : - <p> -- - - - - - less stressful because you really do n't need to " move out " in the traditional sense of boxing up your life and keeping it in storage or at your long-suffering parents ' place . Your incoming guests know that they are moving into somebody 's home " this , along with the savings , is the main reason they are n't staying in a hotel - so they expect to see a certain amount of your " things " ( except if you are pathological hoarder or have recently downsized from Highclere Castle to a Chelsea studio ) . They are moving in for a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a few suitcases worth of space available . <p> - It 's more stressful because your home - if it 's anything like mine - needs to be brought up to standard . I 'm not talking about installing hot tubs or turning your baby 's nursery into a media room , but sorting out all those niggles that you have trained yourself to ignore over the past decades and which might irritate ( or when taken all together , infuriate ) your guest . If you 're a married man , this will be the DIY list that your wife has been hassling you to get on with since Christmas 2008 . Here was my list this summer : <p> replace light bulbs ( x17 ) throughout house . <p> fix WC door handle to prevent self-entrapment by unwitting occupants . <p> tighten loo flush handle and fix flushing mechanism , the trick to handling which only 3 people in the world know . <p> replace laundry basket which looks like it 's been attacked by large dog . <p> descale shower head , kettle etc ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beware these guests ' reactions ... ) <p> fix that door so that it closes without two people having scrummage against it . <p> give to charity those 4 bags of clothes &amp; shoes in the bathroom cupboard which my wife is apparently never going to wear again ( it 's been a good two months and I 'm still married - cull vindicated IMHO ) . <p> As your wife has been really helpfully reminding you , these things only take a couple of hours when you put your mind to it ( or better still - 1.25 hours of thehandysquad.com 's time when she 's not in - strong recommendation ) . The stressful part here is leaving it to the last minute . My advice here would therefore be : <p> General Guidance <p> freshly scrutinise the functioning of your home at least 2 weeks before you are due to let it out , <p> make a list of niggles and sort them out in good time . <p> If you let your house out yourself , you 'll be embarrassed - and your jet-lagged guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kind of turn that and then quickly grab this " that needs to be explained / understood to make every appliance , fixture and fitting work . <p> If you use an agent to explain all this for you , it 's possible you 'll find your commission rate creeping up <p> Your guests ' happiness aside , you will feel an unexpectedly deep sense of personal satisfaction , catharsis and spousal peace at sorting out these domestic niggles for your own benefit . And , whilst there are no prizes for functioning doors and descaled shower heads , it 's the little things which , taken together , will tip an otherwise very happy tenant into a nasty reviewer , no matter how **37;136;TOOLONG your location- or Designer 's Guild your sofa is . Sweat the small stuff here . <p> De-personalising ' <p> As mentioned , guests are expecting to move into a home . But there 's a balance to strike between " homey " and " way too much information " . As agents we always advise on how to strike the balance and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay particular attention to bathrooms and kitchens . <p> Bathroom cabinets and all toiletries should be totally removed and kitchen fridges emptied . <p> Guests appreciate olive oil and sugar/salt/pepper etc and a limited amount of non perishables ( rice , tinned tomatoes ) , but not half a loaf of bread or 8 almost empty cereal boxes <p> Welcome packs with a few items ( fresh bread , butter , jam , tea , milk ) are a great idea . <p> Personal Items <p> if you have the space , close off one room ( the smallest/the study ) for your own things . Put in it a dismountable- coat rail from amazon- ( c. -30 ) to avoid stuffing hanged clothes into bin liners . <p> Label bags with what came from where to help unpacking when you 're back home .

Among posters , letters and CD covers , classmates would cover beds with rugs in a variety of styles .

Mostly , they were a life-saver when making your bed look presentable to The Matron , hiding a myriad of evils , from crumpled bed clothes to the embarrassing Toy Story 2 duvet cover that you still had from your first year of school . <p> The bedspread that I envied most was a wool tartan rug belonging to a Scottish classmate who claimed it was a family tartan ( I later found the same tartan rug at John Lewis , the British retailer ) .

The British Museum 's Life and Death exhibition paints the most human picture that I have ever seen of this catastrophic event and evokes wonder in the way that it reanimates the people in the plaster casts . <p> Above : The dramatic plaster cast of a Herculaneum citizen <p> This is the first major exhibition on Pompeii and Herculaneum to be held in London for almost forty years and advanced bookings are advised if you wish to visit . Over 250 objects have been brought together in collaboration with the Archaeological Superintendency of Naples to create this stunning exhibition , which offers a unique insight into the eruption of Mount Vesuvius by focusing on the everyday lives of the people who lived and died by its side . <p> It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on Pompeii . For the first time , the British public have the opportunity to look into the minutiae of Roman life in these two cities . However , remarkably we find the Romans to be merely a reflection of ourselves . This was a culture in which people had freed themselves from the day to day of household chores and manual labour through slavery , and were perhaps the first to truly enjoy a leisurely life . Of course , we have machines to do these jobs for us now but the free time that we experience makes us very much alike our counterparts in Pompeii and Herculaneum . It makes it seem all the more tragic when you see the cast of a mother holding her child or the family dog curled up on the floor . In this sense , the exhibition really hits home . <p> Above : Remains of Pompeii itself <p> One thing that also strikes you when you walk around the exhibition is that perhaps we could even learn from these people in unexpected ways . A wall painting from a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a couple who appear to run their business together in equal standing . That the woman is seen here holding papers which suggest she was literate and possibly in control of the finances , as well as their pose and presentation , it makes you wonder why it has taken our society this long to even begin allowing women the same rights and respect as men . These sorts of questions are what separate a good exhibition from a really great one , which is exactly what the Life and Death Pompeii and Herculaneum Exhibition is.
