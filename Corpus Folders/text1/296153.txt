@@37743868 @6743868/ <h> Group to keep eye on Lake Lanier quality <h> Water pollution , quantity standards a key topic <p> A group mainly comprising government utilities has been formed to follow state and federal actions concerning Lake Laniers water quality and quantity standards and give feedback as needed . <p> Lake Lanier Stakeholders , which kicked off in a September meeting in Gwinnett County , will focus largely on the Georgia Environmental Protection Divisions development of a " total maximum daily load " and the Army Corps of Engineers update of its water control manual . <p> TMDL " is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still safely meet water quality standards , " according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . And those numbers " may impact utilities , local governments and other stakeholders , " according to a written summary of the lake groups first meeting . <p> In 2008 , Lake Lanier was placed on an " impaired waters " list , pushing to the forefront the need for a TMDL " for the pollutant of concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Juliet Cohen , general counsel for Chattahoochee Riverkeeper , an Atlanta-based environmental advocacy group . <p> " The EPD said it really would like to work with stakeholders to help develop that TMDL , because some people have almost no load , or proportionately almost no load , in the lake and others have very large loads of pollutants , " said Ron Peters , deputy director of Gwinnett Countys water resources department . <p> " And if a TMDL is written , it will affect anyone who is in the watershed , " he said . <p> Still , " we did n't  want this to be ( just ) a Gwinnett County effort , " Peters said . <p> After some interaction with Gwinnett , the Atlanta Regional Commission , which the county is part of , began working with the Gainesville-based Georgia Mountains Regional Commission on a joint effort . <p> " What will happen is the state will establish some sort of ( TMDL ) limit and ( utilities ) will be required to do whatever it takes to comply , " Peters said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mean a major , major refurbishment . <p> " That also includes the agricultural community . Although its a lot harder ( to pinpoint ) , you 've got runoff from pastures that contribute ( to water quality ) . " <p> A document from ARC and GMRC states : " This process will identify both point and nonpoint source reductions that will be required in future pollutant loadings . " <p> Point sources , such as utility discharges , tend to be more identifiable than nonpoint sources , such as septic tanks and runoff . <p> However , " there are methods to address ( nonpoint sources ) , which is essentially trying to create policies that make sure land development and land use is mindful of stormwater runoff , " said Adam Hazell , GMRC planning director . <p> The corps manual update , meanwhile , " will identify potential withdrawals and return flows that will be allowed under existing authorized uses , " according to the regional commissions . <p> " These two parallel activities will require a more integrated approach to water quality and quantity management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resources board voted to raise the amount of allowable chlorophyll-a in testing samples to 6 parts per billion from 5 parts per billion at its Flowery Branch testing site and 7 parts per billion from 5 parts per billion at its Browns Bridge Road site . <p> The move did n't  stir much dissent at the time . <p> The standards change " is based on some updated modeling results that indicated the original standards that were adopted can not be met , " said Elizabeth Booth , manager of EPDs Watershed Planning and Monitoring Program . " They were too tight when they ( were ) established in 2000 . We can not obtain them . " <p> Each April through October , the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper cruises Lake Lanier checking water quality , as part of a sampling and quality assurance plan approved by the EPD . The state agency releases an impaired water list every two years in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act . <p> In water-monitoring tests last year , the group found that , except for an area off the Ga . 53/Dawsonville Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met water quality standards in 2013 . <p> The testing station at the bridge showed 10.6 parts per billion of chlorophyll-a , which indicates the level of potentially harmful algae growth , exceeding the standard of 10 parts per billion . <p> Jason Ulseth , the organizations technical programs director , has said the northern end of Lake Lanier tends to be murkier because of the joining of the Chestatee and Chattahoochee rivers . <p> " As the ( rivers ) are coming in , they 're depositing all the nutrients from that whole watershed and they all get eaten up on that end , " he said . " Generally , we see the clearest water at ( Buford ) Dam . " <p> Andy Pilgrim , Cornelia sewer plant manager , said most governments around Lanier are far from exceeding pollutant limits in their discharges . <p> " The problem is n't point sources , I can promise you that , " he said . <p> " Nonpoint is all your farmers that do n't  have buffers on their creeks that animals get in and out ( of ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken farmers are spreading manure and it rains and washes off into the creek . That 's where its all coming from it is n't coming from wastewater plants . " <p> Nonpoint sources are " definitely the challenge , " said Ken Rearden , director of Hall County public works and utilities . " One of the sources ( officials ) had not looked at was the dairy farms around the lake ( including ) Hall County . You have a bunch of cattle in a small area . " <p> He has asked the EPD to include that as part of a database . <p> The stakeholders group is planning its next meeting for Feb. 27 at Unicoi State Park in Helen
